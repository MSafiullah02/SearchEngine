            "text": "All cancers may be genetically determined with or without other initiating factors. This predisposition may be inherited, occur by mutation or possibly be caused by chemical agents or radiation used in the treatment of tumours. In the treatment of a primary cancer, chemotherapy and radiation are frequently used either separately or together. These agents may be responsible for the development of a second cancer. Primary genetic abnormalities are known to predispose towards more than one cancer. The Regional Paediatric Oncology Data Bank was searched for patients with a second tumour: 27 were found. The age at presentation varied from 1 year to 17 years, with a mean of 6.9 years. The second tumour occurred between i and 23 years, the average being 7.9 years. The primary tumours were Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma, Ewing's, Wilms', intracranial tumours and leukaemia. The secondary tumours were osteosarcoma, cerebral neoplasms, skin tumours, rhabdomyosarcoma and leukaemias. The cases were reviewed in relation to the treatment with chemotherapy or radiation and the site of the tumour in relation to any radiotherapy given. There were few distinguishing factors that might help to differentiate between a treatment-induced tumour and a second primary tumour. Detailed results of the survey and illustrated examples will be given. In conclusion, whether there is genetic predisposition to a second tumour or not, treatment is known to increase the risk of developing a second tumour, and this should be taken into consideration in order to reduce the adverse effects as much as possible.

Trauma was ruled out in 6/17 patients, and therapy was modified in 15/17. Conclusions: MR imaging is useful in children with suspected epiphyseal plate trauma of the knee and ankle and demonstrates the exact extent of the fracture and the involvement of the epiphyseal plate to better advantage than do conventional radiographs. We have reviewed the interictal brain 99mTc HMPAO SPECT scans performed on 53 children from 1990 to 1994 and compared their studies with findings on EEG, CT and MR scans. The ages ranged from 1 month to 17 years, with a mean of 8.5 years. Forty-five children had seizures, seven had hemiplegia or hemiparesis and one suffered haemorrhagic shock encephalopathy. Five SPECT studies were of poor diagnostic quality and one was a failure. In 18 patients with seizures there was good correlation between the EEG, MR and SPECT findings, and in general the CT study contributed little. However, in three of these infants the SPECT study showed a more extensive abnormality than MR. In the other 21 patients with seizures there was poor correlation between the MR and SPECT findings. In five, the SPECTwas normal with positive MR findings. The MR correlated with the EEG study in only two patients. Of nine patients with a normal MR and an abnormal SPECT, the EEG and SPECT findings were consistent in seven. There were seven patients where there was an abnormality on both the MR and SPECT studies but the findings did not correlate in the two examinations, and the SPECT study was consistent with the EEG findings in only two of these. There were seven infants who presented with hemiplegia or hemiparesis. Six of these had MR studies. In three there was good correlation between the MR and SPECT studies, and in a further three the SPECT examination showed a more extensive abnormality. In the seventh patient there was good correlation between the CT scan, EEG and SPECT study. In the patient with haemorrhagic shock encephalopathy, the SPECT and MR findings were similar. In conclusion: (1) MR has become the investigation of choice in childhood epilepsy.",

The gaining of information about the relationship to other organs and vessels and the depiction of adenopathy and metastases depends on the penetration of disturbing artifacts.

High-resolution sonography combined with color Doppler was done in 16 patients (aged 11-24 years) with acute scrotal swelling. Examination was performed with an ATL UM9 HDI machine and a linear 5-10 MHz transducer. Surgical correlation was available in all cases. Color Doppler demonstrated lack of intratesticular flow in only seven of the 14 patients with proved torsion; in five, the testis was swollen and hyperechogenic, associated with venous infarction; in two, peritesticular tissues were thickened and hyperemic and the testis was heterogeneous, associated with necrosis. In seven cases, the testis appeared normal and intratesticular flow was present (symmetrical in five, discretely decreased in two). But in all these cases, we could detect spiral twist of the spermatic cord in the inguinal canal and/or near the testis. Presence of blood flow within the twist was correlated with the degree of testicular vascularization. In two cases, testicular blood flow was increased, with peritesticular hyperemia in one and cord hyperemia in the other, but no spiral twist was detectable. Surgical exploration revealed an appendix torsion. So, even in the case of partial or intermittent torsion, visualization of the spiral twist allows a reliable diagnosis, whatever the color Doppler and morphological findings.",

We have performed ten procedures in children aged from 5 months to 10 years of age. Six procedures were performed for PUJ obstruction and four for strictures of the pelviureteric anastamosis following pyeloplasty. In all cases PUJ obstruction was confirmed using ultrasound, nuclear medicine or intravenous urogram. In none of the cases were stents inserted following the procedure. Balloons of 8 mm or 10 mm diameter were used. In three cases the procedure was performed by an antegrade approach following nephrostomy and in seven cases the procedure was performed by the retrograde approach following cystoscopy. In four cases the procedure was successful, with relief of symptoms and/or improvement in radiology; in one case the radiology was unchanged; and in five cases the procedure resulted in complete obstruction of the PUJ requiring surgical intervention. Two of the retrograde procedures resulted in vesicoureteric junction obstruction. Some individual problems will be illustrated. Our experience suggests: (1)Smaller balloons (4 mm or 6 mm) should be used in babies. (2) The vesicoureteric junction can be damaged by balloon withdrawal and procedures should be performed using the antegrade approach. (3)Stenting may be required to prevent early obstruction of the PUJ. (4) The procedure can be used in selective cases as an alternative to surgical pyeloplasty.",

In 25 cases (38 %) the information from the retrograde could have been obtained by less invasive investigations -nuclear medicine scans or IVU. The examination was most helpful in children with dilated renal tracts and reduced renal function; in children with a thickened bladder wall; and in those with abnormal renal anatomy. The retrograde pyelogram is of limited value in paediatric practice and should only be performed in particular cases following consultation between paediatric surgeons and radiologists with a specific interest in renal disease. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the management of adult pelvic tumours has been demonstrated and discussed in the literature. A retrospective review of MRI in pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma was carried out in 13 children in order to assess the role of MRI in the management of this tumour. Twenty-eight scans were available, four at diagnosis and 24 during treatment. All patients had a combination of axial, coronal and sagittal images with T 1weighted (4 with intravenous gadolinium) and either T2-weighted or inversion recovery (IR) sequences. The scans were assessed for tumour signal, site of origin, extent and optimal imaging sequences and planes. Tumour signal was of muscle signal intensity in 28/28 T 1-weighted scans, enhanced in 4/4 with gadolinium and high on all T2-weighted and IR sequences. Turnout site and tumour extent were correctly identified in 10/10 patients and 5/6 patients, respectively, where surgical correlation was available. Sagittal and axial imaging were useful in intravesical, prostatic and vaginal tumours, whereas coronal imaging was more useful in lesions involving the pelvic side walls. Extension into the spinal canal and muscle involvement were best seen on coronal T 2-weighted and IR sequences. T 1-weighted sequences were useful for prostatic turnouts. We conclude that MRI is of value in the management of pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma in children, with the added benefit of the lack of ionising radiation. Introduction: A number of cases have been reported in the world literature which attest to the occurrence of renal cell carcinoma in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients. Though the accumulated literature suggests that patients with TSC are at increased risk of renal neoplasia, the association of renal cell carcinoma and angiomyolipoma with or without TSC may lead to confusion, particularly since angiomyolipomas can be locally invasive and demonstrate tumor-like neovascularity on angiography. We evaluate whether this confusion can be alleviated. Methods: Four pediatric cases of TSC/angiomyolipomas were collected, one of which had metastatic renal cell carcinoma diagnosed. Reviews and case reports of TSC and renal cell carcinoma and related imaging findings were identified by searching the MEDLINE database. Manual searches of the \"bibliography of reviews\" in Index Medicus, of personal files, and of the reference lists from all identified reviews were performed. Cases found suitable for review in the available literature from 1922 through 1993 comprised the data analyzed.",

Analysis of the distribution of characteristics and incidence of renal cysts, renal cell carcinoma, and lymph node involvement demonstrate a decreased risk of renal cell carcinoma in patients with TSC (P < 0.01) despite their presentation an average of 20 years younger than patients without TSC. Conclusion: Despite convincing anecdotal evidence over the last 70 years suggesting a possible relationship between TSC and renal cell carcinoma, a meta-analysis of a majority of reported cases and cases of coincident angiomyolipoma and renal cell carcinoma without TSC implies a lower risk of malignant degeneration in TSC patients. Statistical analysis of the data indicates that at least 46 more cases of TSC with coincident renal cell carcinoma need to be documented to refute the conclusion of this meta-analysis.",

            "text": "A survey using questionnaires and thermoluminescence dosimeters for nine frequent X-ray examinations in the 5-year-old child was carried out in 106 European children's clinics during 1993-1994. Entrance surface dose (ESD) measurements were taken, and the original radiographs were evaluated for image quality by a panel of nine pediatric radiologists. A brief report on a study on the evaluation of radiographic technique image quality and ESD was given at this year's European Congress of Radiology. This report will deal in more detail with selected aspects of this study, in particular with the impact of good radiographic technique on patient dose and image quality as recommended by the \"Quality Criteria for Diagnostic Radiographic Images in Paediatrics\", i. e. the Working Document of the Commission of European Union. As reported, wide variations of ESD values and radiographic technique were again found. The ratios between the maximum and minimum ESD values were as high as 71 : 1 (standard chest pa film). As was shown in a previous survey in infants, significant patient dose reduction was reached by those departments who used the recommended guidelines without any accompanying loss in image quality. This survey again emphasizes the need for quality assurance measures in all age groups in pediatric radiology. A large collective dose reduction could be achieved if these guidelines are implemented. Background: Quantitative color velocity imaging (CVI-Q) is a new ultrasonographic technique to quantify volume flow (VF) in blood vessels [1] [2] [3] . Purpose: To use CVI-Q VF measurements to study the relationship between cardiac function and carotid blood flow (CBF). Methods: In seven swine, an arteriovenous fistula was created between the common carotid artery (CCA) and the jugular vein. CBF was measured externally with CVI-Q and compared with continuous VF readings from a Transonic probe clamped around the CCA, cardiac output (CO; through Swan-Ganz catheter thermodilution method), heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure. CO and CBF were varied by (1) opening or closing the AV fistula, (2) hyperventilation, (3) withdrawing or infusing intravascular fluids, (4) infusing medications (dopamine, fi-blocker). Results: We produced a wide range of hemodynamic conditions (high-and low-output cardiac failure, hypovolemic shock, vasopressor overdose). CVI-Q VF measurements correlated well with Transonic readings, but were less reproducible. CBF autoregulation compensated for changes in CO. CVI-Q VF waveform analysis revealed marked variability of CBF resistance in different hemodynamic states. Conclusions: CVI-Q is a valuable noninvasive technique to study the relationship between CBF autoregulation and cardiac function. These results are applicable to children undergoing complex cardiovascular interventions. In our experience pancreatic venous sampling (PVS) is the method of choice for preoperative localization of hyperinsulinism in children. However, in a few patients general anesthesia induces normoglycemia, probably by inhibition of insulin secretion. PVS becomes impossible. In two such cases, selective intraarterial injection of calcium in the splenic and gastroduodenal artery, in association with insulin sampling in the hepatic vein, allowed us to make the diagnosis of diffuse form in one case and focal form in the Between 1991 and 1994, 82 children were treated with an intussusception-type antirefiux valve (ITARV) in the Roux-en-Y loop, as described by Nakajo et al. [1] , in order to prevent ascending cholangitis after hepatic portojejunostomy or bilio-digestive anastomosis. The patients included 68 cases of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), 10 of biliary atresia, 3 of congenital bile duct dilatation (CBDD), and 1 of biliary tree trauma. We report on 5 patients (2 boys, 3 girls) displaying an uncommon ultrasonographic (US) aspect (4 cases) or presenting complications (1 case) due to this surgical procedure. The first case is a 16-month-old girl complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting 7 days after OLT. Abdominal US showed an intussusception but contrast enema was normal. Discussion with the surgeon led to the conclusion that the US intussusception aspect corresponded to the ITARV. The second case is a 5-year-old girl with OLT (2 years 3 months) presenting with gastroenteritis. Abdominal US performed in another institution showed an intussusception aspect, which was thought to be due to the ITARV. The third case is a 13-year-old girl showing an transitory dilatation of the Roux-en-Y limb after creation of an ITARV for CBDD. Finally, in two boys aged 17 and 10 months, systematic US of the liver (respectively 2 and 1 month after OLT) showed dilatation of the Roux-en-Y limb proximally to the ITARV. The first boy was asymptomatic and dilatation subsequently decreased. The second one developed transitory biliary tree dilatation and one episode of cholangitis. A second-look laparotomy failed to show any mechanical obstacle at the level of the valve. We conclude that ITARV in the Rous-en-Y loop may lead to US diagnostic errors, such as intussusception or intestinal obstruction, related to the recent of this surgical technique and/or the lack of experience of the radiologist. Careful analysis of the \"pseudointussuspcetion\" picture and knowledge of this surgical technique may help to avoid such pitfalls. Purpose: To understand why we are observing an increasing number of cases of functional intestinal obstruction among low and very low birth weight prematures within their 2 first weeks of life.",

            "text": "The study included 11 premature infants, mean gestational age 29 weeks and mean birth weight 1055 g, admitted to our hospital during the past 2 years, and presenting clinical and radiological suspicion of functional intestinal obstruction. We retrospectively analysed the respiratory conditions at birth and their treatment, the timing of meconium passage, the type of feeding and the medications received. Radiological features suggesting intestinal obstruction and/or excluding other diseases were reviewed, as well as the results of contrast enema when applied. The clinical outcome was analysed focusing on intestinal evolution. Results: At birth, all the 11 prematures presented with hyaline membrane disease and were treated by mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction and morphinomimetics. They were fed by total parenteral nutrition. (Partial) meconium passage was observed within the first 2 days of life in six patients and was markedly delayed in five. Obvious intestinal distension was observed on plain abdominal films as soon as day 4 and as late as day 13 (mean day 8). Hpyertonic water-soluble contrast enema was performed at bedside in nine of the patients, using 30-60 ml of Gastrografin, without complication. It had to be repeated in six patients, from 2 to 4 times; thick meconium plugs were evacuated and intestinal outcome was favourable in all nine patients. The two infants who did not have contrast enema underwent surgery respectively at days 4 and 13. In the first, no perforation had occurred, but thick meconium at the ileocaecal junction was removed preoperatively. The other presented with an ileal loop perforation, and thick meconium plugs were observed. Conclusion: Several factors contribute to the genesis of meconium plug-like syndrome in low and very low birth weight prematures (colon immaturity, restriction, morphinomimetics and the lack of enteral nutrition are the most important factors). This condition is likely to occur at the end of the first week of life, even if previous (partial) meconium passage has been observed. It has to be differentiated from other meconium diseases and from necrotising enterocolitis. The clinical condition, along with plain film of the abdomen, should suggest the diagnosis, and the treatment should remain conservative, using hypertonic water-soluble contrast enema at the bedside. Unrecognized, this entity can lead to intestinal perforation. Object: Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation in pediatric blunt trauma victims is often clinically occult, yet, unlike solid organ injury, requires early surgical management. We assessed the role of CT in identifying these patients. Materials: All surgically confirmed post-traumatic GI perforations over a 10-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Forty-one patients were identified, with 20 having had preoperative CT evaluation. In addition, the CT scans of a further 10 patients were identified with suspected bowel injury who underwent laparotomy or post-mortem without perforation evident. All CT studies were evaluated for extraluminal air, free fluid, bowel wall thickening or enhancement and bowel dilatation. Results: Extraluminal air was seen in 10/30 cases, bowel wall enhancement in 24/30, bowel wall thickening in 24/30, bowel dilation in 15/30 and free fluid in 27/30. Associated solid organ injury was present in five patients, all of whom had perforation. When all five of the evaluated CT findings were present, there was 100 % sensitivity and specificity for G! perforation. However, this was the case in only 5/20 patients with perforation. Eleven studies had 4/5 findings, nine had 3/5 findings, three had 2/5 findings and two had 1/5 findings. The 10 false positives included four hypovolemic shock bowel syndromes and six mesenteric hematomas with serosal tears of bowel, of which two involved additional retroperitoneal hemato-ma. No CT of a patient with perforation was normal, and if four or more of the above CT findings were present specificity was 75 %. Conclusion: CT is sensitive for detection of GI perforation and, in a small group, highly specific. Directed CT evaluation in conjunction with repeated clinical assessment by experienced surgical staff will improve early detection of GI perforations in the remaining patients. Introduction: Enteroclysis is the term for contrast administration by means of duodenal intubation. We have elected to pursue this method because contrast material administerd orally is altered by fluid in the stomach and small bowel, which leads to segmentation and fiocculation. As a result, mucosal folds are not properly visualized. The enteroclysis provides a more constant and more rapid filling of the jejunum and ileum. The contents of these portions of the bowel are pushed ahead of the barium column, resulting in better images. Objectives: To evaluate the role of enteroclysis in the diagnosis and management of children with various abdominal problems; to elucidate its indications and reliability.",

All children had duodenal intubation one or more times, with informed consent and full knowledge of the procedure by the child and parents. After careful introduction of the tube, preferably by the oral route (mean duration about 15 rain), the barium suspension, specific weight 1.15-1.20, depending on age and weight of the child, was infused at a rate of 25-100 mi/min. During the examination, graded compression was applied by the radiologist under fluoroscopic control and appropriate spot films exposed. In most cases diagnosis could be correlated with other clinical data, operation, and follow-up. Results: Indications for the study of the small bowel included Crohn's disease, obstruction (stenosis/adhesions), Meckel's diverticulum, and malabsorption. Diagnostic findings included normalcy in 40 % of cases, Crohn's disease in 35 %, obstruction and/or adhesions in 10 %, atrophy in 5 %, and fistula in 3 %. The diagnosis of a giant Meckel's diverticulum could be made in retrospect only. Conclusions: (1) The enteroclysis method is especially suitable for the demonstration of normalcy, for the assessment of the exact nature and extent of disease, and for pre-operative delineation of stenoses, fistulae, and infiltrations of the bowel wall. (2) Given adequate information and positive understanding of the young patient, the procedure is tolerated well. (3) The advantages of enteroclysis for examination of the small bowel are: reliable findings, radiographs of superior quality, and a relatively short examination time.",

In four of the infants, (mean gestational age 30 weeks) the NEC was very severe and extensive, requiring early surgical intervention. Two of these infants also had Down's syndrome, but both had structurally normal hearts and no evidence of Hirschsprung's disease. The fifth baby developed NEC at i week following surgery for Fallot's tetralogy. In this infant the NEC was less severe and responded to medical treatment alone. All these infants were investigated, 2-6 weeks following resolution of the acute episode, for continuing gastrointestinal symptoms. The fistulae (colo-colic, jejuno-colic and ileo-colic) were demonstrated by either upper or lower gastrointestinal contrast studies. All fistulae were associated with bowel strictures, and in some cases there was evidence of previous localized perforation. Four of the strictures were confirmed surgically: one patient died from a septicaemic episode in the preoperative period. Our findings confirm that fistulae formation does occur in NEC but is an unusual complication. The possibility of a fistula in addition to strictures should be considered in infants who develop relatively non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms several weeks following the initial episode of NEC [1] . In recent years, balloon dilatation of colonic strictures has become feasible [2] , and was considered in one of our cases. The procedure was cancelled following the diagnosis of the fistula on the pre-procedural contrast study. This emphasizes the importance of considering the possibility of an enteric fistula, in addition to a bowel stricture, as the cause of continuing gastrointestinal symptoms. It is commonly accepted that abdominal lymph nodes are difficult to visualize and infrequently visualized in children. Therefore any visible lymph node is thought to be probably abnormal. This is grossly inaccurate, as in the region of the hepatoduodenal ligament and the mesentery normal lymph nodes are visible in virtually every child. This presentation concentrates on the nodes around the hepatic artery which we have nicknamed \"the daisy chain\". If the hepatic artery can be demonstrated just medial to the take-off of the gastroduodenal branch, nodes are visualized in this region in 96 % of normal children. The major reason for non-visualization is interposed gastric gas. In 200 subjects from birth to age 20 years in whom the anatomical location could be visualized and in whom the nodes were visualized, the long axis and short axis of the largest node were measured in order to establish the normal range for this region in children. Appreciation of the sensitivity of ultrasound in demonstrating normal nodes during routine abdominal echography and of the expected range of normal size should increase the sensitivity of detection of abnormal lymph nodes. Purpose: Echogenicity of portal veins in the liver is normally homogeneous in intensity throughout the liver parenchyma. We present three children in whom we detected an area of locally increased echogenicity of the peripheral portal veins in the liver. We suspected that this ultrasound finding represented an area of focal peripheral intrahepatic pylephlebitis. The purpose of the study was to establish whether the increased echogenicity was related to an inflammatory process in the abdomen which causes focal intrahepatic pylephlebitis in these children.",

Between January 1984 and December 1994, 430 orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT) have been performed in 362 children (age 96 days to 14.5 years) in our institution. We observed lmyphoproliferative disorders with masses in the transplanted liver detected by radiological studies in three patients. In one child, one of the nodules initially appeared calcified. In another, two liver calcifications developed during recurrence of the disease at the site of a previous surgical biopsy. In the first child, a 18-month-old boy, rou-fine ultrasound (US) of the hepatic graft 4 months after OLT disclosed nine masses, among which one spontaneously calcified. Two months earlier, US study of the liver was normal. The child did well, but blood tests and liver biopsy revealed lymphoprotiferative disease. Evolution under treatment revealed decrease in size of the masses, but the calcification remained unchanged. Another 15-month-old boy was investigated by US 4 months after OLT for poor general condition and abonormal liver enzymes. US showed multiple hepatic masses and abdominal nodes. The diagnosis was established by liver biopsy. Several weeks after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy, the nodules disappeared, and subsequently recurred with two calcifications at the location of a previous surgical biopsy. So far, spontaneously calcified liver masses in lymphoproliferative disease have not been described in children with OLT. The ethiopathogenesis of the calcified masses is discussed in light of the data from the literature concerning lymphomas. Background: The pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux is not yet fully understood, and there have been reports suggesting that delayed gastric emptying (GE) increases propensity to reflux. GE examination techniques rely currently on radionuclide equipment, which is expensive and delivers radiation. After having validated a US method by comparison to scintigraphy, a twofold study was undertaken in order to investigate the physiological and pathological aspects of GE. Population and methods: Physiology of GE was determined in 200 non-vomiting babies aged 2 months to 2 years by varying feeding formula quantitatively and qualitatively. GE was determined in 300 children with variable patterns of symptoms; among 133 vomitting babies, 30 had esophagitis, 48 had recurrent or long-standing respiratory diseases, 34 had apneic spells and 85 were siblings of near-miss infants. Results: Tremendous physiological variability in the GE could be observed, depending on the volume intake and the feeding formula, which have to be carefully taken into account before defining the \"normal\". The relation between GE and reflux was as follows: normal emptying inducing no reflux or a limited number of events (< 3/10 min), whereas delayed emptying favored refluxes. However, reflux rate was not exclusively dependent on the emptying delay, but also on the associated length of abdominal esophagus, GE delay and extreme esophageal shortening inducing iterative reflux. In the case of symptomatic refluxes, emptying delay was present in 100 % of those with esophagitis and in 42 % of those with reflux-related cardio-respiratory symptoms. Different specific patterns could be defined: (1) In the case of esophagitis, delay was specific by its long-standing \"en plateau\" pattern extending over the 1 h. On the other hand, association with a patent shortening of the abdominal esophagus, leading to a severe dysfunction with repetitive refluxes, was pathognomonic. In these cases the impaired balance between emptying delay and esophageal continence was a far more reliable finding than the increased rate of refluxes, which could disappear in some circumstances, especially under treatment. (2) In the case of cardiorespiratory pathology, two patterns became apparent: (a) A considerable emptying delay specifically associated with esophageal and pyloric dysmotility leading to esophageal retention. This aspect was found in 16/98 cases, including low birth weight babies with apneic spells, repaired hiatal hernia and mentally disabled children with recurrent pulmonary symptoms. (b) A moderately non-specific delayed emptying associated with hiatal and pyloric spasticity and constricted esophagus leading to unexpected massive and explosive refluxes. This feature was found in 41/98 children in association with pharyngolaryngeal abnormalities -gaping larynx (16 cases), laryngospasm (12 cases) proven by barium swallow, or reflux-induced cough (20 cases). Conclusion: GE after standardized meal can easily become a routine part of studying reflux. Evaluation of gastric emptying together with esophageal length and gastroesophageal motility makes examination a rather pathophysiological process, defining specific patterns of \"pathological reflux\". Material and methods: Four children (three boys, one girl), right handed, from 7 to 11 years of age, with AVM of the brain in the frontal and rolandic region, were studied with functional MRI to ascertain the location of the AVM and the motor area. The study was performed on a Signa 1.5-T device (GEMS). SPGR sequences were obtained during the performance of a motor paradigm with the contralaterat hand. The signal analysis was performed in the time domain thanks to software developed by C.D. and Y. C. Results: In one case of frontal AVM the motor area was localized in the usual precentral region, far from the AVM. In two cases the motor area was seen to be localized at the periphery of the AVM. In one case, ipsilateral activation of the motor cortex was seen, with no activation of the contralateral hemisphere. After embolization no motor deficit was observed in three cases. In one case, a transient motor deficit was observed 48 h after embolization. Conclusion: Functional MRI appears to be a useful tool to help plan the embolization in the treatment of cerebral AVMs in children. Purpose: To evaluate the contribution of computed tomography in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in children, as this method has recently been questioned [1] . Materials and methods: Between October 1988 and December 1994, 121 temporal and cerebral CT exminations were performed in children with SNHL (57 unilateral, 64 bilateral). All CT were retrospectively compared to clinical, audiometric data and findings of surgery (when performed). Results: In our study, a high proportion (40 %) of abnormalities were detect by CT: 21 cases (17.5 %) of inner ear malformation (one unilateral, 20 bilateral); nine cases (7.5 %) of ossified labyrinth; eight cases (7 %) of asymmetrical internal auditory canal (IAC) (two enlarged, six stenosed); six cases (5 %) of cerebral anomalies; two cases of otosclerosis; and two cases of abnormal oval window. Conclusion: These results support the idea that CT still remains the first investigation to perform in SNHL in children, since acoustic tumors are rare among them. However, CT is known to overlook membranous labyrinth abnormalities as well as non-ossified labyrinthitis, which may account, at least in part, for our 60 % negative CT. On the other hand, MR imaging, as sole method, would fail to demonstrate the bony inner ear, footplate and IAC abnormalities. One of the great problems of today's neonatology is the so-called postasphyxia syndrome which follows intrapartum asphyxia. There are two main reasons to detect the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in that disease: (1) The CBF plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease, so it affects the diagnosis and therapy. (2) The potential neuroprotective agents have severe side effects, the therapeutic window is very narrow (the first 24 h), and the disease itself or the cerebral oedema caused by it cannot be detected either clinically or with sonography or CT at the newborn age. MR examina-tion is difficult in patients needing intensive care. Color Doppler measurement can be a helpful tool both in diagnosis and in therapy, especially with the advanced technology used in the measurements. We divided our patients into three groups according to their birthweight (below 1250 g, 1250-2500 g, above 2500 g) and performed the examination with ATL UM 9 HDI equipment with color Doppler technique using computed spectral analysis. We calculated the mean flow velocity (MFV). Griese et al. [1] found a correlation of 0.72 between the measurements of CBF by the MFV and the ~33xenon clearance method. Resistance index, used previously, had a correlation of 0.56 only. We formed two groups concerning asphyxia: the newborn was classified as asphyxiated if the Apgar score was less than 1/5, and as a normal control with an Apgar score more than 8/9. Altogether, 18 children were examined repeatedly (every 6 h) within the first 72 h. Parameters which might alter the CBF were also checked, like Hgb, Hct, pH, pCO 2, pO 2, RR, R and respiration parameters. We conclude: (1) There is a linear increase of MFV and CBF with gestational and postnatal age.",

Purpose: CT produces relatively high levels of radiation in comparison to other radiologic examinations. Because of the higher sensitivity of their tissues to radiation, and because of their long life expectancy, infants and children are more prone to suffer from radiation-induced pathologies than adults.

            "text": "Between October 1991 and January 1995, more than 100 low-dose CT examinations of the head and face were performed at the University Children's Hospital, Ztirich, Switzerland. All studies were done using a fourth-generation scanner (Picker PQ 2000). The areas examined included the mandible, maxilla, paranasal sinuses, and orbits. The studies were performed for evaluation in trauma, infection, and malformation. Examination parameters were as follows: 45-100 mAs, 1.5-4 mm slice thickness. Both high-resolution and standard reconstruction modes were used. Results: All studies were considered to be diagnostically adequate. Low-dose CT appeared particularly suited for areas with inherently high tissue contrast (air to soft tissues, and air to bone); however, contrast discrimination for characterization of associated soft tissue lesions was not adequate. Conclusion: Low-dose CT is an important adjunct for evaluation of trauma, infection, and malformation of the cranio-facial area in children. Low-dose CT may be used alone, or in addition to normal-dose CT in cases where soft tissue characterization is required. Purpose: PVL is a ischemic-hypoxic insult characterized by its manifestation in preterm infants. We observed, however, a high incidence of signal changes in the periventricular white matter in term infants with complex congenital heart disease. To investigate the nature of these lesions, postmortem MR images of uncut brains were compared to matched histological sections. Materials and method: Patients with complex congenital heart disease or respiratory failure requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) who had died between 1 August and December 1993 were selected from the records of the Department of Pathology. Five infants aged 3-60 days, mean 24 days, with ECMO or hypoplastic left heart syndrome following major surgery in hypothermia and heart arrest were included in this study. Postmortem MR imaging of the entire fixed brain were performed in the five infants on a 1.5-T supraconducting unit. Short TR (700 ms), short TE (14 ms) spin-echo and long TR (3000 ms), short (22 ms) and long (120 ms) TE were used to obtain T1, proton and T2-weighted series. Slice thickness was 4 ram, number of acquisitions 1 and matrix size was 192 \u00d7 256. A gradient-echo sequence for increased susceptibility was also obtained. Signal abnormalities seen in the postmortem MRI were drawn into schematic coronal sections. In addition to obtaining stanard serial macroscopic and histologic sections of the brain, lesions seen on MR were labeled and multiple histologic sections obtained from these areas. Results: Among 43 lesions, 37 were in the periventricular and six in the subcortical white matter. Histologically, 30 of 43 areas of signal alteration were due to acute (n : 6), subacute (n = 19) or chronic PVL (n = 5), eight lesions were due to congestion or focal edema, and in four areas of abnormal appearance on MR no abnormality was found on histological sections. Typical signal changes were increased signal on T1-and decreased signal on T2-weighted sequences. Signal abnormalities were related to microcalcification (10), increased cellularity (10), coagulation necrosis (4) and white matter gliosis (2) . Conclusion: A large proportion of periventricular white matter lesions in term infants at risk for hypoxic-ischemic events are due to PVL. Mierocalcification is a major but not the only factor underlying abnormal signal on MRI. Extracerebral fluid collections in infancy are a diagnostic problem because noninvasive neuroimaging has permitted no definite differentiation between two distinct pathological conditions. An enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces in children with macrocephaly is a frequent observation of mostly unknown etiology, but is known to be associated with a good prognosis. If surgery is necessary in these patients, ventricular shunting is required. On the other hand, subdural effusions are often of traumatic origin and frequently require neurosurgial intervention (subdural shunting). Most reports on extracerebral fluid collections in infancy have not differentiated between these two pathological conditions and therefore reveal confusing results. Recent studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown that vascular flow phenomena in the arachnoidic space can be used for reliable diagnosis, whereas previous neu-roimaging attempts, including high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) have been useless [1] . From 1992 to 1994 we investigated a cohort of 20 patients (five female, 15 male) aged 4-30 months (mean 10.5 _+ 6.6 months), 16 with the history of macrocephaly and normal neurological development and four patients after head trauma and the symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. In all 16 patients with the clinical diagnosis of benign subarachnoidal space enlargement, colour-coded Doppler sonography detected arachnoidic vessels within the fluid collection. Furthermore, highresolution ultrasound demonstrated the dural border of the arachnoides as an echogenic membrane. This can be used as a further sign of the subarachnoidic location of the fluid collection. In the four patients with subdural hematoma, the fluid collection showed an increased echogenity, no vascular structures and no surrounding border. From these observations we conclude that high-resolution ultrasound and colour Doppler sonography are able to reliably differentiate between a subdural and a subarachnoidal fluid collection. MRI, with its higher risks (sedation, anesthesia), focused only on this target, seems therefore unnecessary in these patients. The presence of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is suggested by CT findings and monitored by invasive methods like intracranial catheters. A new tool for noninvasive estimation of ICP is measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). With Bscan sonography the perineural subarachnoidal space can be depicted and changes recorded at the bedside. This phenomenon depends on pressure transfer from the subarachnoidal intracranial compartments. Our experimental study with 40 postmortem human optic nerves showed that pressure induced bulging predominantly in anterior regions (mean 1.54 ram, range 0.9-2.2 ram). Effects of probe orientation, sound direction and different examiners proved negligible. On the basis of these results, a clinical investigation of 24 children under treatment for increased ICP was performed. With transbulbar sound direction the ONSD was measured repeatedly in axial views. Parallel changes of ONSD and ICP were recorded, especially when ICP increased. Age-matched controls never exceeded an ONSD of 4 ram, but all patients except two did. The peak ONSD was significantly increased in patients compared to controls (5.3 vs 3.0 ram; paired t-test, P = 0.007). In conclusion, findings of increased ONSD in children demonstrate elevated ICP, provided local orbital disease can be excluded. This noninvasive method ist helpful for therapy planning and for selection of patients for invasiv catheter monitoring. The prognosis of SWS is partly related to early occurrence of seizures, but the diagnosis of this phakomatosis may be difficult during the first year of life. Neurological signs can be absent, and the usual neuroradiological abnormalities (cerebral atrophy, cortical calcifications, enlargement of the choroid plexus, perfusion abnormalities) may be delayed. We have performed a retrospective study of seven patients with confirmed SWS (7 days to 3 months old). None of the patients presented with seizures. They all underwent MRI (T1, T2 sequences) and SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) at the same time.",

            "text": "Regional cerebral blood flow was measured using tomomatic 564 x xenon-133. In all cases, myelination appeared to be accelerated in the abnormal cerebral hemispheres on both MR sequences. This was particularly obvious in the areas underlying the leptomeningeal angioma. In five cases, SPECT showed hyperperfusion in the damaged hemispere. In one case, SPECT was symmetric; in one case SPECT showed an area of hypoperfusion in the damaged hemisphere which was already atrophied. These data suggest that the accelerated myelination is not related to ischemia but to transient hyperperfusion. This MR pattern can be helpful for the early diagnosis of SWS, which is of upmost importance because of the preventive antiepileptic treatment. Newborn infants are particularly prone to hypothermia because of unsatisfactory heat production due to lack of movement, increased heat loss due to impaired vasomotor reflexes, large surface to body volume ratio and poorly developed subcutaneous fat. Our medical center serves a large semi-desert area with poor socioeconomic conditions compared to the rest of the country. Six out of 11 infants admitted with neonatal hypothermia (the majority being Bedouins) presented with multiple organ failure, seizures and coma. The CT scan demonstrated diffuse cerebral edema with \"reversal sign\", a reversal of the normal density relationships of gray and white matter and a relatively increased density of the thalami, brainstem and cerebellum. The follow-up of five infants demonstrates severe developmental delay with brain atrophy and multicystic encephalomalacia. One infant expired after 30 days. The \"reversal sign\" is not specific. These patterns have been previously described in abused children with head injuries [1] , preterm ischemia [2] and anoxia due to drowning [3] . However, it has never been described in hypothermia. Background: Study of the interrelationship between cardiac function and cerebral blood flow is important in children following surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) or embolization of cranial arteriovenous malformations (CAVM). Quantitative color velocity imaging (CVI-Q) is a new ultrasonographic technique to characterize and quantify volume flow (VF) in blood vessels [1] [2] [3] . Semiautomatically, a VF curve (in ml/min) versus time is generated, analogous to a Doppler spectral waveform of linear flow velocity Purpose: To determine the value of CVI-Q VF waveform analysis of carotid blood flow in children with CHD or CAVM. suffering from stridor and laryngeal dyspnea. Seven of them had a cutaneous facial hemangioma. The results of US were compared to the endoscopic findings. In 16 cases, the radiologist was unaware of the endoscopic findings at the time of the US examination. In nine cases, the subglottic area appeared normal at US as well as at the endoscopic examination. In 10 cases, US diagnosed and located a hemangioma with good accuracy. In one case, the hemangioma was initially overlooked by endoscopy because of an associated edema and was found retrospectively in US as a hyperechoic spot within a subglottic edema. This hemangioma was followed up by US and progressively increased in size. The hemangioma was leftsided (n = 4), right-sided (n = 3), posterior (n = 2) or circumferential and predominantly posterior (n = 2). The smallest lesion had a 3 mm diameter. Compared to muscles, the hemangioma was isoechoic in six cases and hyperechoic in five cases. The main differential US diagnoses of subglottic hemangiomas are briefly discussed.",

Standard views of the facial bones and the mandible were obtained in all patients prior to chemotherapy. Post-treatment radiographs were acquired in six patients. The clinical and radiological distribution of the turnouts was tabulated according to whether one or more jaw quadrants were involved. Results: Clinically 29 % of patients and radiologically 92 % of patients had involvement of more than one jaw quadrant. Some 42 % of patients had involvement of all quadrants. The clinical and radiological presentations were tabulated. All cases had a history of painless loosening of teeth, distortion of intraoral ridge and an ulcerated intraoral mass. Radiologically, one patient had early signs of the turnout, i. e., loss of lamina dura around the affected first mandibular molar surrounded by small discrete lucencies and an enlarged crypt shadow. The rest of the patients showed late signs. Mandibular turnouts showed an ill-defined lucency, displaced teeth and loss of lamina dura. Maxillary turnouts showed antral opaeification, bony destruction, nasal mass plus dental changes. Post-chemotherapy films in three patients showed grossly displaced teeth returning to their normal sites, Bony regeneration without regeneration of the lamina dura occurred in all six cases. Conclusion: (1) Radiographs show tumour formation in jaw quadrants not clinically involved. (2)In endemic areas it would be good practice to take jaw radiographs in children 3-8 years old with loose molars for which no local cause can be found.

A general assessment of the marrow stores after BMTwas performed, and non-blinded correlations were made with the simultaneously acquired imaging data. The recovery of osteoclast function after BMT allows an improvement of bone marrow stores. Bone marrow scintigraphy provides a direct, whole-body method for visualizing the marrow spaces. These marrow spaces are less opaque than the surrounding sclerotic bone on conventional radiographs and may be of higher signal intensity than sclerotic bone on T2-weighted MR images. MRI may be helpful in evaluating marrow stores in the pelvis and spine, where scintigraphy is limited by the exuberant activities of the liver and spleen. Knowledge of bone marrow activity can be useful in assessing the success of BMT, which remains the only curative treatment for the majority of patients with AR osteopetrosis. ",

            "text": "Purpose: The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the value of CT and MR in adolescents with displacement of the posterior rim apophysis of lumbar vertebra. Patients and methods: Over, a 8-year period, seven children in this series (age range 10-]5 years, mean 12 years) were referred to the orthopedic department for lumbar and sciatic pain. Four patients had an initial acute trauma. In all cases, conventional X-rays were performed. Six underwent CT, and four had a MR study with T 1and T2-weighted images. Results: Plain X-rays showed avulsion of the posterior rim apophysis in three cases. Two patients had associated isthmic lysis. CT and MR studies showed avulsion in all cases. MR T2-weighted images demonstrated an abnormal intervertebral disc signal in two cases. It also showed in all cases disc material herniated between the vertebral body and the posterior rim apophysis. In one case MR demonstrated disc herniation at the same level. Discussion: In the literature two etiologies are suggested: true fracture or lumbar posterior marginal node. According to Laredo et al. [1] and Takata et al. [2] , true fracture is usually associated with acute trauma and lumbar posterior marginal node with irregularities of the end plate. Our series does not correlate with such findings. Conclusion: CT is valuable for the diagnosis. MR (sagittal T2weighted images) shows the lumbar posterior marginal node and the posterior rim apophysis. Anatomy and physiopathology of these lesions remain controversial. MR performed early in the course of the disease may lead to a better understanding. Acute suppurative thyroiditis is a rare disease in childhood. It is usually due to a sinus tract extending from the tip of the piriform sinus to the thyroid region. Embryologically it arises from a fourth branchial pouch fistula. It often presents as an abscess in the lower lateral neck, usually on the left side. The diagnosis can be suggested by US, radionuclide scintigraphy, or CT, but the diagnosis can only be established by barium swallow, demonstrating the sinus tract. However, the barium swallow can be a very difficult procedure with false-negative results. Demonstration of an air bubble in the abscess by plain film or CT is very suggestive of the diagnosis. Demonstration of the fistulous tract by air while drinking a carbonated beverage can be an alternative diagnostic tool replacing the barium swallow. Complete surgical excision of the sinus is essential. Five cases of pyogenic thyroiditis due to a piriform sinus fistula are presented, four of them on the left and one on the right. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 15 years. The value of various diagnostic modalities will be shown and discussed.",

Taccone To evaluate the normal age-related bone marrow change of thoracic wall, shoulder and extremities, we retrospectively reviewed 122 T1 weighted MR examinations of thoracic wall and shoulder and 128 examinations of upper and lower extremities. The patients had no history of bone marrow disease. Concerning thoracic wall and shoulder, we evaluated the bone marro changes in three anatomic segments of the proximal humerus (epiphysis, metaphysis, proximal diaphysis) and three segments of the thoracic wall (sternal manubrium, scapular body and ribs). The patients were divided into six age groups: 0-1, 1-3, 4-6, 7-10, 11-15, and 16-24 years. The signal intensity of all anatomic segments was as low as or lower than that of muscle in all patients younger than 3 months, reflecting an underlying hematopoietic marrow. The first segments to become hyperintense were the humeral epiphyseal ossification cen-ter, the diaphysis and the scapula. While in the humeral epiphysis and diaphysis bone marrow reaches a diffuse increased signal intensity with age, the sternum, ribs, scapulae and humeral metaphysis maintain varying percentage of intermediate signal intensity. Regarding upper and lower extremities, we considered the metaphysis and diaphyses of major long bones. Among round bones, the capitate, calcaneus, talus and patella were considered. Proximal femurs were excluded because previously evaluated. Five age groups were studied: 0-1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-24 years. The signal intensity of all anatomic segments was as low as or lower than that of muscle in all patients younger than 2 months. After this age, the first anatomic segments to become hyperintense were epiphyseal ossification centers, metatarsal bones and phalanges, followed by diaphyses and metaphyses. In the round bones, age-related Tl-weighted MR images follow a pattern similar to the epiphyses. The pattern of physiologic conversion from red to yellow marrow in different anatomic segments, related to the age groups, is reported. Knowledge of the normal age-related MR appearance of red and yellow marrow is necessary for the recognition of abnormal patterns as well as of marrow infiltration by tumors or other pathologic processes.",

The partial or complete disruption of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system would explain the hormonal deficiency of the adenohypophysis. Absence of diabetes insipidus might be due to a spontaneous regeneration of an ectopic neurohypophysis at the proximal end of the transsected neurohypophyseal tract. Reports have appeared in the past 5 years of skeletal dysplasia (both long bone and spine) resembling spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia in patients with thalassemia treated with hypertransfusional therapy and deferoxamine chelation to reduce iron overload. The affected patients had tong-duration therapy, often starting in the first 2-3 years of life and at a dose level considered high by today's standards. We report the natural history of spine changes in two patients whose spine films were available from infancy through childhood until adult life. Each went through a radiographic sequence of normal spine appearances at onset to bulbous vertebrae to eventual flattening identical to the changes reported by Neuhauser and colleagues in the early 1950s in survivors of childhood abdominal tumors treated with radiation. Radiation therapy has also been noted to cause long bone rickets-like metaphyseal irregularities similar to those seen with chelation therapy. The common pathway in both (post-deferoxamine and post-radiation therapy) is probably a primary effect on cartilaginous, not bone, growth and development with an effect on enchondral ossification. Purpose: Emptying appears very important in the assessment of gastroesophageal reflux when considering scintigraphic studies. The latter are very precise methods, but are based on expensive equipment and deliver radiation. US, which is non-invasive and more physiological, has been proposed as an alternative. In this study, US and scintigraphy (Sci*) were compared in order to validate the US method and to make it acceptable in clinical practice.

A total of 597 children with clinical signs of acute pneumonia were included. Pulmonary infiltrates were verified at radiography. Chest X-ray was repeated after 4-6 weeks. Children with residual infiltrates had a third chest examination another 3-6 weeks later. One hundred and seventy-eight children had residual changes at the second chest X-ray, and among these, 57 patients still had radiological changes at the third X-ray. The history of the children and the size and type of the radiological findings at the first X-ray were analyzed for possible presdisposing factors for delayed healing. The results were: Group A, the total study group; group B, children with infiltrates on the second but not on the third X-ray; group C, children with residual infiltrates at the third chest film. Chronic disease such as Down's syndrome, congenital heart disease, immunological deficiency and cerebral palsy, and a history of repeated pneumonia, were significant factors associated with delayed resolution of parenchymal infiltrates. Among the children with residual parenchymal changes at the third X-ray control, we also found one child with a foreign body in the airways, one tumor case, and a previously unknown case of congenital heart disease. Asthma was not associated with delayed healing of pneumonia. The presence of large infiltrates and atelectasis on the first chest examination was associated with delayed radiological healing. The likeness between groups A and B in these respects seems to indicate that the optimal time for control X-ray may be more than 6 weeks after the initial examination in cases without known predisposing factors. Results: There were 17 females and 20 males ranging in age from 1 day to 68 months (mean 8 months). Of the five radiographic features, the mediastinal density sign was observed most frequently (81%). Identification of a portion of the right descending aorta was the next most frequent finding (70 %). These two radiographic observations, alone or in combination, identified over 90 % (34/37) of the right arches. Tracheal indentation (40 %) or deviation (27 %) were relatively infrequent and were more subjective, being dependent on visualization of the airway and patient rotation. Identification of the aortic knob was least frequent (16 %). The initial CXR interpretation correctly identified the right arch in only 51% (19/ 37) of patients. A left arch was reported incorrectly in two patients, the arch position was stated to be indeterminate in five patients, and in 11 patients the position of the arch was not mentioned.",

Identification of tracheal indentation, deviation, or the aortic knob may be helpful but are rarely isolated findings. Purpose: To demonstrate normal craniovertebral bone and ligament anatomy and to detect fractures of the occipital condyles and ligament injury. Materials and methods: Seven children and young adults were studied (age 4.5-21 years, median 11 years) after decelerating head injury with components of either high velocity or axial compression. Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission ranged from 3 to 15, median 7. With appropriate cervical protection and in the supine position, patients underwent fine-slice (1.2 mm \u00d7 1 mm), contiguous, axial computed tomography of the region between the second cervical vertebra and the foramen magnum, either at initial presentation or during hospital admission. Coronal, sagittal and curvilinear reconstructions with bone and soft tissue windows were performed. Normal bone and ligament anatomy was identified, including occipital condyles, first and second cervical vertebrae, transverse ligament of atlas, alar ligaments, and tectorial membrane, as well as the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane and apical ligament of dens. Occipital condyle fractures were classified as type I, II, or III according to Anderson and Montesano [1] and displacement and hematoma were described. Ligament injury included disruption (discontinuity) or asymmetry (ipsilateral shortening or contralateral stretching) of the alar ligaments. Results: Four occipital condyle fractures were identified in three patients (one bilateral type I and two unilateral type III). Ligament injury was seen in one case and hematoma in two. Normal bone and ligament anatomy was clearly demonstrated in four cases. Conclusions: Craniovertebral bone and ligament anatomy, fractures, and ligament injury can be clearly demonstrated using fineslice axial computed tomography with reconstructions. The severely injured patient need not be endangered by a coronal scanning angle, and delineation of pathology may guide the therapeutic approach. Growing skull fracture (GSF) is a progressive enlargement of fracture due to an underlying tear of the dura. It is a rare complication of severe head injury mainly reported in young children. Classically, the diagnosis is made on clinical follow-up weeks or months after the original injury on the basis of a palpable skull defect or a bulging mass. Initial skull X-rays show a large (3--4 mm) fracture developing to a large bone defect with irregular edges when diagnosis of GSF is made. CT is useful to show evidence of brain damage always present beneath the fracture. We present the MRI findings of GSF in a series of eight children. They were 1 months to 8.5 years old. Seven children had a severe head injury and the last one probably a birth trauma. All children underwent skull X-rays and cerebral CT at the time of initial injury. MRI was performed for six patients in the first 3 months after trauma (day 8 to 3 months). Two children underwent MRI with a delay of 8 months and 6 years. All children had initially a large linear fracture and on CT underlying brain damage. In all cases the MRI showed a zone of the same intensity as the brain contusion or CSF advancing through the bone margins of the fracture to the subcutaneous plane. This finding was interpreted as an indirect sign of the dural tear. Six of our eight children were operated on, with surgical confirmation and repair of GSF, ranging from 2 to 14 months after the initial injury. One child has only undergone a shunting procedure because of severe hydrocephalus. In one case the parents refused surgery. We think that MRI can yield an early diagnosis of GSF, even at the time of the initial injury. Surgical repair of the lesion which consists mainly of closure of the dura, could be proposed earlier, before the increase of the dural tear underlying the GSF. Moreover, some authors believe that progressive brain damage could happen in injured cerebral tissue unprotected by dura. Three patients showed signs of bone marrow infiltration on MIBG and MRI, which were confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. Two patients, a case of normalisation and a case of relapse, had concordant findings on MIBG and MRI at follow-up examinations. One patient showed complete healing of the bone marrow infiltration on an MIBG scan performed after four courses of chemotherapy. However, a persistent hypointense signal of the bone marrow on MRI was suggestive of marrow infiltration until 15 months after diagnosis. In this patient, marrow and vertebral body biopsies showed the absence of tumour. Conclusions: These results suggest a good concordance between MIBG and MRI findings for bone marow infiltration. Further studies are needed to understand the differences of kinetics in bone marrow response to treatment. It is essential to combine functional data given by MIBG and morphological data given by MRI for a better staging and treatment follow-up of neuroblastomas in children. The purpose of this study was to document abnormalities of the hip joint synovial-capsular complex (SCC) in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) and to seek a possible simple methode for assessing response to enzyme replacement therapy in this condition. Ultra-sound imaging of the hip was performed prospectively in ten patients with MPS. The study group consisted of i Hurler, 3 Sanfilippo, 4 Morquio and 2 Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome patients. Using a standard technique, the ultrasonographic characteristics of the hip joint SCC were evaluated and assessed quantitatively. MRI correlation was available in three cases. Pathologic correlation was obtained in one case of Morquio and one of Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. In a normal population of 65 patients, a logarithmic relationship was demonstrated between the hip joint SCC distance (SCCD) and patient age. No significant difference (P < 0.01) was shown between the sexes or sides. In all MPS patients there was significant thickening (P < 0.001) of the hip SCCD when compared to normals. In addition, the Maroteaux-Lamy patients showed a significantly (P < 0.05) greater involvement than the remainder of the MPS types. SCC thickening was related to soft tissue infiltration, which was isoechoic or slightly hyperechoic to muscle and of homogeneous echotexture. Most deposition occurred in the soft tissues superficial to the joint space, MRI confirmed the ultrasound findings, demonstrating the abnormally thickened capsule to be isointense to fibrous tissue and the synovium to be isointense to muscle on T 1, T2 and FLASH sequences. Histopathologic examination revealed abnormal thickening of the fibrous hip joint capsule with infiltration of both the superficial and deep layers of hypertrophied synovium by mucopolysaccharide storage cells, shown by immunoelectronmicroscopy to contain glycosaminoglycans. Th degree of SCC thickening correlates mainly with the amount of mucopolysaccharide deposition in hip synovium. It probably represents a major contributing factor in causing joint stiffness, which was present in all of our cases. Ultrasound is a simple, noninvasive technique allowing quantification of mucopolysaccharide deposition in the hip and may have a role in evaluating response to treatment, particularly with current developments in recombinant enzyme replacement therapy [1, 2] .

Multiplanar images of the spine and femora were acquired with T 1 and T 2 weighting. Results: Eight scans were performed on six patients -four before and four after BMT (one patient was imaged both before and after BMT, another on two separate occasions after BMT). In all severely affected patients, MRI of the spine and abdomen prior to BMT showed complete lack of signal from the bone marrow alternating with signal intensity equivalent to intervertebral discs, resulting in a step-ladder appearance of the spine. Hepato-splenomegaly with low signal relative to the kidneys was present on short-TR/TE images due to extra-medullary haemopoeisis. One patient images 18 months after BMT had central low signal with intermediate signal peripherally in the vertebral bodies, the humeral and femoral medullary cavities appearing of normal signal, consistent with active haemopoeitic marrow and successful engraftment with functioning donor osteoclasts. The size of and signal from liver and spleen were normal. A subsequent scan at 20 months showed regression of the marrow spaces to the pre-treatment status coincident with late graft failure. Another patient imaged before and 6 weeks after BMT showed little significant change, with minimal increased signal peripherally at the vertebral bodies and persistent hepato-splenomegaly, coinciding with failure to engraft donor osteoclasts and reconstitution with autologous marrow. A further patient showed linear metaphyseal high signal at the knee after BMT, consistent with early osteoclastic activity confirmed clinically by the detection of donor DNA in the peripheral blood using molecular probes. Conclusion: MRI is useful before and after BMT in patients with osteopetrosis, as successful engraftment or reconstitution by native marrow can be differentiated.",

They comprise approximately 12 % of soft tissue neoplasms in childhood and differ in many respects from their counterparts in adults [1] . Various subtypes have been described exhibiting benign, indeterminate, and malignant biologic behavior. Few case reports exist on the imaging characteristics of fibromatoses. We reviewed the radiologic findings of 17 pathology proven cases with fibromatosis. Infantile myofibromatosis, fibromatosis not otherwise specified, and aggressive fibromatosis were the most frequent diagnoses. Others included fibrous hamartoma of infancy and fibrosarcoma. We analyzed the features on US, CT, and MRI, which allowed us to define the location, size, contour, and architecture of the lesions within the soft tissues. Radiography in addition allowed characterization of osseous involvement. Imaging findings of all entities will be presented. Both specific and nonspecific features of the different entities were noted. In conclusion, we found plain radiography and MRI particularly useful in preoperative assessment and staging of fibromatoses. Specific features in some of the lesions may obviate biopsy. and 18 (15.4 %) for acute liver failure. All plain-film radiology, both before and after OLT, was retrospectively reviewed. In those children in whom fractures were found a detailed analysis of clinical data, including history of trauma and drug history, was carried out. Nineteen children (16.2 %) sustained a total of 69 fractures. Thirteen children (11.1%) were pre-OLT and six children (5.1%) were post-OLT when the fractures occurred. Age at time of fracture ranged from 3months to 9years 8months (median 13.5 months). The reason for OLT in the children with fractures was extrahepatic biliary atresia (n= 12), neonatal hepatitis (n = 2), Alagille's syndrome (n = 1), tyrosinaemia (n = 2) and primary hyperoxaluria (n = 2). Metabolic bone disease, assessed qualitatively on plain radiographs, was present in 17/19 children at the time of fracture. This took the form of rickets (n = 3), osteopenia (n = 12) and osteosclerosis (n = 2). There was no documented trauma in 14/19 cases. Children in this group were aged from 3 months to 9 years 8 months (median 7.75 months) at the time of fracture, and in six cases the fractures occurred during the hospital stay in which the OLT took place. Common factors in these six children were young age, generalized skeletal demineralisation due to chronic cholestatic liver disease, prolonged hospitalisation and in the post-OLT phase, the use of drugs, including steroids, cyclosporin and, in one case, heparin. The findings demonstrate that children undergoing OLT are susceptible to fractures and that this risk is probably related to end-stage chronic liver disease. The need for clinical and radiological awareness of the fracture risk, particularly during the pert-transplant period, is emphasized.",

            "text": "Osteotomy followed by limb lengthening is a new orthopedic procedure in the treatment of asymmetric limb development. Starting the distraction at the proper time is important. Conventional radiography shows the developing callus too late and until now distraction between the two osseous fragments has been begun on a theoretical base. We believe that ultrasonography has potential value in accurately measuring the distraction gap and in imaging the new bone formation earlier than radiography. Limb lengthening in a small series (n = 5) was monitored by ultrasound scans. The distraction gap appeared as a sonolucent area within which echogenic foci developed and became aligned in the longitudinal plane. We propose an echographic staging of new bone formation to enable the orthopedic surgeon to monitor the distraction rate in each particular child. Since overly fast distraction inhibits bone formation and overly slow distraction leads to premature consolidation, ultrasound may serve a useful role in the qualitative evaluation of new bone in limb lengthening. There was no gender difference in the incidence of this complica-tion, which occurred in 11 boys (6.9 %) and three girls (6.4 %). Affected children had short stature, markedly delayed bone development, and were frequently asymptomatic. In two instances, AVN developed while the children were on corticosteroid therapy. Congenital short trachea (CST) has diminshed tracheal rings, a high carina, and has been primarily reported as a pathologic finding in syndromes and in spina bifida patients. Its main clinical association has been with inadvertent intubation of a bronchus, usually the right, during attempted endotracheal intubation. We report an infant with CST and left lung hyperinflation. Inability to image the thoracic trachea and airway led to bronchography, which revealed the carina to be at the thoracic inlet; the distal left mainstem bronchus was extrinsically narrowed. MRI and coronal CT showed the major vessels to be at their usual level. At operation a thight band effect on the left mainstem bronchus was found, due to the overlying ligamentous ductal remnant. Division and ligation of the band relieved the obstruction. This appears to be a rare and possibly new cause of vascular-related airway disease. Similar findings have been noted in the past with post-right pneumonectomy patients as well as in agenesis of the right lung. In these two entities the rotation of the heart into the right chest produced extrinsic compression of the bronchus by the ductal remnant and the adjacent pulmonary artery and aorta. More then 300 articles have appeared in the world literature describing techniques, results and complications of percutaneous renal biopsy during the past 40 years, but there were only a few pediatric data among them. Over a period of 6 years ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsies were performed 45 times in 41 children aged 1-16 years. Each patient underwent ultrasonography on the I st and 3 rd day following renal biopsy, and one child had computed tomography. The blood pressure, bleeding time, clotting time and prothrombin time were normal in all cases. Two children had decreased creatinine clearance. Four patients had a total of eight complications, including gross hematuria lasting for more than 12 h (one case), pain lasting for more than 12 h (one case), subcapsular hematomas (three cases), perirenal hematoma (one case) and intrarenal hemorrhage (two cases). We did not find the complication of intra-renal arteriovenous fistulas. Palpable hematoma, infections, and death did not occur. According to the literature the complication rate seemed greater where the creatinine clearance was decreased. When kidney tissue was not obtained, there was a higher incidence of complications, but this was not the case in our group. There was no relation between patient's age, size of biopsy needle and rate of complications. All iatrogenic disorders were improved by conservative treatment. They did not require blood transfusion or invasive treatment. Kidney needle biopsy by ultrasound guidance is a relatively safe procedure. The complications should be detected by early ultrasound examination. Renal osteodystrophy is an important finding in children with chronic renal failure (CRF). The term renal osteodystrophy is used to include skeletal disorders of patients with CRF: osteitis fibrosa, osteomalacia and/or \"rickets,\" osteosclerosis and the rarer associated extraskeletal calcifications. Current research is attempting to unravel the pathogenetic events and underlying mechanism of uremic osteodystrophy. These include an early occurrence of secondary hyperparathyroidism which has been attributes to phosphate retention, hypocalcemia, the impaired production of 1,25(OH)2D, the altered \"set point\" for PTH secretion, the skeletal resistance to PTH and the diminshed degradation of PTH. Moreover, aluminum intoxication and metabolic acidosis may have a pathogenetic role in renal osteodystrophy. In the past few decades, the astonishing progress in life prolongation of patients with CRF has greatly enlarged the number of subjects with these metabolic problems and has brought to light severe and novel forms of the disease previously not frequently encountered. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection and evaluation of osseous damage in children with CRE We studied 14 children (11 male, three female; mean age 13 +_ 3 years range 2-16 years). Eight out of 14 patients were treated conservatively (GFR 8-40 ml/min per 1.73 m2; mean duration of CRF 6 _+ 3 years) and six patients were undergoing hemodialysis (mean duration of HD 7 _+ 3 years). In all patients, the femora and the pelvis were examined with 0.5-T MRI, using T1weighted spin echo (TR 500, TE 25 ms) and inversion recovery (STIR; TR 1200, TE 13, TI 120 ms) sequences in the coronal and/ or in the sagittal planes. MRI showed this following patterns of bone involvement: (a) diffuse thickening of cortical bone with various degrees of medullary channel restriction; (b) structural change of bone marrow component, with abnormal predominance of yellow bone marrow in comparison with reports in the literature for healthy children of the same age; (c) evidence of intramedullary pathological tissue areas (\"brown tumors\"). We observed a significant correlation between the MRI findings and the severity of CRF. In conclusion, our study suggested that MRI may give valuable information about the progression of bone marrow in children with CRE Moreover, MRI can be useful in the follow-up of the extent of bone damage. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to adapt the scoring system described by Bhalla et al. to computed tomography (CT) and compare it with the chest X-ray (CXR) scoring system described by Brasfield. Materials and methods: Twenty-seven patients (aged from 4 to 34 years) with CF were examined using CT and CXR. All CXR and CR scans were independently scored in a blinded fashion by two radiologists, using the system described by Brasfield (CXR) and a system adapted from Bhalla et al. (CT) .",

In many cases the lesions are relatively small and are of uncertain clinical significance. We report on the outcome of 21 lung lesions diagnosed on routine prenatal ultrasound scanning. The relative contributions that chest radiography, ultrasound and CT scanning make to both diagnosis and postnatal management will be discussed. In 14 cases, a complex \"mass\" was noted prenatally containing both cystic and solid echogenic components. One case has not yet reached term. Two pregnancies were terminated; postmortem examination confirmed extensive cystic adenomatoid malformation (CAM) in both. Of the 11 live-born infants all were asymptomatic, apart from mild transient respiratory distress in one. Only 10 were investigated postnatally. The other infant was asymptomatic and discharged without follow-up! Chest radiography was abnormal in nine, but was diagnostic only in two. Although diagnostic in one infant, demonstrating a solitary cyst, ultrasound was generally unhelpful. CT was helpful in the five infants scanned. Three children have undergone surgery, with CAM lung being confirmed in two and a combined CAM/sequestrated segment in one. The presumed diagnoses in the other seven included CAM/sequestrations, a bronchogenic cyst and pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. All remain well and asymptomatic at a mean age of 26 months. Four prenatal scans showed solid but small echogenic masses thought to represent sequestrations. Birth is awaited in one. The others were asymptomatic at birth and remain well at a mean age of 18 months. Chest radiography showed mild abnormality in two. Hypoplastic left lung was diagnosed prenatally in one case and confirmed postnatally by chest radiography. The infant is well at 16 months. Three intra-abdominal pulmonary sequestrations were detected prenatally. U1-trasound showed small complex masses related to but separate from the left adrenal in all three cases. Surgery was performed in two with confirmation of the diagnosis. The other infant, aged 2 years, remains well. Thus the prognosis for children with prenatally diagnosed lung lesions is generally good. Initial chest radiography was abnormal in all infants who have so far required surgery. Baekgronnd: Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most common and serious opportunistic infection in children with AIDS and the other immunodepressive conditions. The disease was also observed in premature debilitated infants. Purpose: To evaluate the pulmonary appearance preceding PCP in newborns, the chest radiographic patterns during the infection and the sequelae of the neonatal pneumocystosis. Patients and methods: From 1991 to 1994 at our institution 15 premature neonates with gestational age 32 _+ 4 weeks, Apgar score 4.6 _+ 2 and body weight 1470 _+ 560 g (mean + SD), and with respiratory support for longer than i week, were treated because of PCP. Parasites were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by a monoclonal antibody technique (immunohistochemical staining method). We reviewed retrospectively chest radiographs obtained in the first 2 days after birth, in the period of parasite detection and during clinical recovery or the late period of the disease. Results: Of 11 neonates investigated after birth, eight had radiological symptome of RDS and three had pneumonia acquired in utero. Pneumocystis carinii parasites were detected at 28 _+14 day of tiefe (mean_+ SD). The chest X-ray pattern observed at the time of parasite detection had started 14 days (median) earlier and showed ground glass opacities in all patients. In 12 of 13 newborns the air bronchograms were obtained and the opacities were seen to occupy the whole lung fields with peripheral lesions, although the changes were more pronounced in perihilar regions in five patients. Two children had additional patchy and linear consolidations in the medial lung regions. Five children had air leakage symptoms: two pneumothorax and five interstitial emphysema. Early after the radiological pneumocystosis symptoms became evident, chest X-ray in five of 13 patients showed more evident infiltrations in the perihilar regions, or lesions only there, from the late one in the developed disorder [occurring 4 days (median) later]. Seven of 14 children died, at 72 (median) days of life: one died of PCP at 20 days of life, and six developed BPD. BPD was also radiologically evident in two survivors. Radiographic features of the next five patients during the next 2-6 weeks of treatment were unchanged and similar to the pattern at the time of parasite detection.",

The radiographs were assessed by two observers and a consensus obtained for the presence of ground glass opacification, lobar/multifocal consolidation, reticulonodular shadowing, peribronchial thickening and bronchial dilatation. The presence of pneumothorax, pneumatocoeles or mediastinal lymphadenopathy was documented and serial change assessed. Where possible, findings were correlated with clinical and laboratory data. Results: Ground glass shadowing was present in 8/30 patients, with a widespread distribution due to PCP in three patients, related to cytomegalovirus pneumonitis following ventilation for Pneumocystic carini pneumonia (PCP) in two patients. Three patients with lobar ground glass shadowing responded to empirical antimicrobial therapy. Consolidation was present in 14/40 patients, the presenting feature of PCP in five, related to pneumococcus in three patients, cryptococcus in one patient and atypical tuberculosis in one further patient. Parainfluenza III was isolated in two patients with multifocal consolidation. Repeated multifocal consolidation was related to aspiration pneumonitis and chronic reflux in one patient and to terminal pulmonary haemorrhage in a patient with lymphoma. Reticulonodular shadowing occurred in 6/30 cases, due to LIP in five patients and following cryptococcal pneumonia in one. Peribronchial thickening/dilatation was seen in 9/30 patients: following repeated infections in five cases, chronic aspiration pneumonitis in one, chronic LIP with traction bronchiectasis in two and PCP in one. Mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy was seen in 9/30 patients: associated with repeated infections in four cases, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare in two and due to LIP in three. Cardiomegaly was present in one of two patients with proven clinical cardiomyopathy Conclusions: Abnormal chest radiographs were seen in 26/30 symptomatic patients, with LIP occurring in 20 % (6/30): only one developed lymphoma.

The aim of the study was to evaluate HRCT in such children with pneumonia resistant to therapy. Chest radiography and HRCT were performed in 26 children aged from 10 months to 20 years. Nineteen patients had leukaemia, one lymphoma, one cystic fibrosis, one HIV infection (AIDS) and haemophilia, one bone marrow transplantation, two lung infiltrates of unknown cause and one Epstein-Barr virus-associated haemophagocytosis syndrome. We found 10 cases of invasive aspergillosis, four cases of lung abscess (one oesophagobronchial fistula), two interstitial edema, one graft versus host reaction, five alveolar infiltrates and four cases without pathological pulmonary findings. HRCT is a valuable method for early detection of specific infection, especially Aspergillus pneumonia, in children with leukaemia and other severe disorders. Echinococcus pulmonum is a relatively frequent tumor of childhood caused by parasitic infection. Macedonia is an endemic area due to poor social and hygienic conditions. The nonspecific symptoms often lead to confusion with pneumonia, tuberculosis or pleural effusion. In this study we investigated 19 patients (age range 5-8 years) hospitalized in 1993 and 1994. Besides laboratory methods, diagnosis is based on plain chest film and conventional tomography, but in some difficult cases ultrasound and CT investigations were performed. Antibodies to antigen blood test was performed in 16 patients, and 14 positive results were confirmed. Twelve patients were examined by ultrasound. The cyst was seen in the lung only when it was localized near the chest wall of diaphragm. CT was performed only three times. Of the 19 patients, 11 were male and eight female. Nine patients had cysts on the right side, eight on the left lung, while three had liver cysts diagnosed by ultrasound. In one case cysts were found on both sides. One child who was hospitalized because of pleural effusion had a subdiaphragmatic liver hydatid. The cyst had ruptured into the right lung. It was confirmed by CT and treated surgically. Based on the results obtained by each method we came to the conclusion that conventional radiographic and laboratory investigations are in many cases sufficient for the correct diagnosis to be made.",

A 6-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital in June 1992 due to epistaxis. Microcytic and microangiopathic anemia was detected. The primary chest X-ray revealed very prominent pulmonary arteries, and peripheral vascularity was poor due to pulmonary hypertension. The patient's sister had died at 3 years of age due to right-sided heart failure during infection. At autopsy the cardiac and pulmonary findings were found to be typical of pulmonary hypertension. Despite digoxin, diuretic and anticoagulation therapy and night-time oxygen administration, also at home, the patients' clinical condition deteriorated. She could walk only a few metres and had a poor appetite, and consequently lost weight. The patient was entered on the heart-lung transplantation list. Extensive tests of the blood coagulation system yielded normal results. She failed to respond in the pulmonary vasoditatator test (nifedipine), and thus vasodilator treatment was not started. The treatment was further intensified. Hyperalimentation via nasogastric tube was commenced. Gradually the patient improved, as was also evident on X-ray and echocardiography examinations. In July i[993 peripheral vascularity was increased in the chest X-ray control, while the prominence of the pulmonary arteries was decreased. The patient's condition was better, and she is now attending school. In ECG and ultrasound the situation is also better. The situation worsened temporarily during infections. The patient has been removed from the transplantation waiting list. One third of adults with primary pulmonary hypertension show a response to vasodilators, and their prognosis is better than in those who do not respond. In children this disease is rare and the epidemiological knowledge of the disease is scanty. Anticoagulant therapy is always indicated. In conclusion, pronounced pulmonary hypertension, usually irreversible, can decrease during therapy and is detectable on chest X-ray. ",

Recently, high-resolution sonography has replaced urography as the imaging method to screen for renal anomalies, and a high incidence of renal cysts in patients with Turner's syndrome has been reported (16 %). A 22-year-old woman with Turner's syndrome who presented normal urographic findings during childhood and adolescence was recently referred to our Institution for further evaluation because of moderate renal failure. On renal sonography both kidneys were found to be of normal size and presented increased echogenicity with numerous small cysts (maximum size 18 ram). Bilaterally some small nodular echogenic areas without acoustic shadow were also found. To our knowledge this is the first report of bilateral cystic lesions in Turner's syndrome. The finding of echogenic nodular areas is of uncertain significance and has not been previously reported. This feature will be further investigated by CT and MR. Ultrasound examination is now considered the first-line method for detection of renal abnormalities, also in Turner's syndrome patients. The presence of numerous renal cysts in our patient suggests the desirability of earlier echographic evaluation in all pediatric patients with Turner's syndrome. We report a case of an extrarenal retroperitoneal Wilms' tumor in the right adrenal gland with metastasis. CT, MRI and ultrasonographic appearances of this extrarenal Wilms' tumor were those of a relatively homogeneous and solid mass. We discuss the need to consider this diagnosis when confronted with a retroperitoneal juxtarenal mass and the advantages of performing chemotherapy before surgery, and evaluate CT and ultrasonography in this case. This tumor is very rare. The median age of the patients is 3.6 years. The retroperitoneum is the most common site. It has been postulated that extrarenal Wilms' tumor arises from extrarenal displacement of metanephric or mesonephric remnants.",

Renal diseases are frequently recognized in [1] is a rare type of double collecting system defined by the association of an ectopic ureterocele with a dysplastic renal upper pole. The upper pole ureter decreases in size upwardly and loses patency in its proximal portion. Case report: We report a variant of this condition found in a female child evaluated for urinary infection. The upper pole ureter had involuted at its two extremities but remained as a dilated segment (the ureteric cyst) in its mid-portion. Discussion: The pathophysiology of this anomaly can be compared to that of incomplete allantois obliteration leading to urachal cyst. This case, proven by surgery and pathology, illustrates the complementary nature of ultrasound, voiding cysto-urethrography and intravenous urography in the evaluation of complex double systems. Each of those techniques alone would have missed the diagnosis. In accordance with previous reports [2] , surgical excision rather than percutaneous drainage was performed to prevent infection and/or recurrence. Conclusion: Although it is rare, ureteric cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a lateral cystic retroperitoneal mass in a child. Introduction: Prolapse of the ureter's mucous membrane is a very rare anatomical condition. Prolapse is simply a protrusion of the ureter into the bladder. In contrast to ureterocele, which is covered by bladder mucosa, the ureteral prolapse is covered by ureteral mucosa. Case report: A 10-year-old boy was admitted with dorsal pain in the right kidney region and macroscopical haematuria. Ultrasonography and CT revealed no anomaly of the upper urinary tract. In the bladder, on the right side, an ureterocele-like formation was seen by both procedures. Intravenous urography showed a filling defect in the bladder, and some contrast filling was seen inside this mass. Cystography showed a filling defect in the bladder. There was no reflux. By cystoscopy a polyp-like mass was identified in the ostium of the right ureter with a necrotic surface. These examinations suggested a right \"atypical ureterocele\" without dilatation of the upper urinary tract. At surgery the intracystic mass was removed. Histology showed a prolapse of the right ureter's mucous membrane.",

The twins, initially diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound, were further imaged after delivery as part of their preoperative evaluation for separation. Initial evaluation by MRI demonstrated two kidneys in each twin; however, on nuclear renal scan only one functioning kidney and a single ureter to a common bladder was seen in each twin. A second bladder without ureteral openings was found during endoscopy. In addition, the twins shared a common atretic distal colon that communicated with the two cloacal malformations on contrast studies. We emphasize the value of contrast studies with fluoroscopy over other imaging modalities in the evaluation of this complex deformity. Uni-or bilateral benign testicular tumors are known in patients with adrenogenital syndrome. Differentiation from testicular malignancies by ultrasonography is sometimes difficult. The aim of the present study was to compare the ultrasonographic appearance of these lesions with the presentation on MRI. Twenty patients with adrenogenital syndrome between I and 24 years of age underwent high-resolution scrotal ultrasound. Six patients with testicular lesions detected by ultrasound were examined by MRI. Uttrasonographically, the lesions were hypoechoic with well-defined margins. Distribution was solitary of multifocal, uni-or bilateral. On MRI the lesions appeared hypointense in the otherwise hyperintense normal testicular tissue. Further criteria for differentiation from testicular malignancies could not be obtained by MRI. Therefore ultrasonographic monitoring is the method of choice for detection of testicular lesions in patients with adrenogenital syndrome, and for follow-up examination to document decrease of tumor size during hormonal therapy.",

            "text": "Brachydactyly In brachydactyly A4 the middle phalanges of the second and fifth fingers are short and the middle phalange of the lateral toes are missing. Type A4 brachydactyly is exceedingly rare and the four families that have been reported suggest autosomal dominant transmission. We report on four families with A4 brachydactyly. Previously unreported findings include: microcephaly, patent ductus arteriosus, hallux valgus, duodenal atresia, restricted elbow movement and syndactyly of toes. Longitudinal follow-up suggested that hypoplasia or absence of the diaphyseal ossification centers is the primary phenomenon. Epiphyses, although somewhat delayed, were generally normal. Our observations suggest that absence of the middle phalanges of the toes may be caused by fusion. The management of developmental delay of the hip (DDH) varies widely, with some clinicians relying on clinical examination alone and others using ultrasound assessment to guide management. There is uncertainty regarding the optimum age to perform ultrasound examination and apply splintage, the duration of splintage necessary and the best type of splint to use. We reviewed the ultrasound reports of 339 children referred for clinical instability of the hip, and the examinations and records of all children who were reported as having dysplasia of Graf type II C or worse, to assess the effect of splintage. All the ultrasound examinations were performed by radiologists. Four treatment groups were identified: those who received no treatment, and those who were treated within the first 6 weeks of life with the Von Rosen splint, the Craig splint or the Pavlic harness. A normal outcome was defined as Graf type I by the age of 12 weeks, abnormal as Graf type II or III, and dislocated as Graf Type IV. The results were as follows (number of hips): Use of the Von Rosen splint results in fewer abnormal hips than use of the Pavlic harness (P < 0.05) or no treatment (P < 0.05). Use of the Craig splint and the Pavlic harness showed no statistical benefit compared with no treatment. These early results suggest that ultrasound-guided management with early splintage of dysplasia of type II C or worse, using the Von Rosen splint, is the most effective treatment for DDH. A prospective trial continues. The incidence of tuberculosis of bones and joints has decreased markedly in the past three decades. Cystic tuberculosis is a rare variety of tuberculosis associated with disseminated lesions of the axial and the extra-axial skeleton. Multiple cystic bone lesions in tuberculosis are much more commonly encountered in children than in adults. The purpose of this report is to present a patient with cystic tuberculosis involving multiple bones and to discuss the differential diagnosis briefly. An 8-year-old girl complained of pain and swelling of the left knee. Initial radiography of the left knee showed a well-defined small obsteolytic lesion at the distal metaphysis of the left femur. Then she felt masses in the skull and right clavicle. As the masses had increased in size, biopsy was carried out. Langerhans cell granuloma was diagnosed pathologically, suggesting either tuberculosis or Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The patient was then referred to our hospital. Radiographs at the time of admission demonstrated multiple osteolytic lesions involving the skull, right clavicle, right scapula, ribs, left iliac bone, distal metaphysis of the left femur, and epiphysis of the left tibia with progression. No surrounding osteosclerosis could be identified. These findings appeared to represent Langerhans cell histiocytosis. No lesions could be seen in the spine. A chest radiograph was clear. A second biopsy from the right clavicle finally proved the diagnosis of Mycobacteriurn tuberculosis. The patient had had BCG vaccination 3 years previously. She had no family history of tuberculosis. Following antituberculous therapy, the multiple osteolytic lesions improved slowly. A number of diseases may demonstrate multiple osteolytic lesions. In acid-fast bacilli infection of bone, Mycobacteriurn tuberculosis, Mycobacterium boris (BCG vaccination-induced infection), or atypical mycobacteria may show a radiographic appearance similar to that in this case. Langerhans cell histiocytosis, metastasis from neuroblastoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and osteomyelitis are the most common causes of multiple osteocytic lesions in infants and children. Sarcoidosis, generalized fibromatosis, and lmyphangioma, which are rare, also may cause multiple osteolytic lesions. Metastases from neuroblastoma and leukemia mainly involve the metaphysis, with somewhat irregular margins. Langerhans cell histiocytosis usually occurs, in the shafts of the long bones, surrounded by a sclerotic margin. Although the diagnosis of tuberculosis may be difficult, as in this case, tuberculosis should be included in the differential diagnosis. The early diagnosis of tuberculosis is important, as prompt and adequate treatment will preclude excessive damage to bones and joints. In the distraction gap, an accumulation of fluid 13 mm in diameter was detected. This was not aspirated. X-ray examination revealed a lack of the ossification process. The Ilizarov apparatus could be removed only after 9 months. The ossification process was complete after 12 months. Case 2: The 4-cm lengthening of the right tibia and fibula of a 10-year-old girl was performed in correct a congenital shortening. In the distraction gap, an accumulation of fluid 15 mm in diameter was detected. This was aspirated under US guidance. After i week, there was no longer any sign of fluid. The Ilizarov apparatus was removed after 14 weeks, and the ossification process was complete after 6 months. Discussion: US examinations permit determination of the corticotomy gap length, assessment of the development of new bone, and detection of certain complications. US-guided fluid aspiration can reduce the time of the procedure and promote the completion of the ossification process. In order to co-ordinate the rate of distraction and new bone formation, it is necessary to use X-ray and US examinations together. Early detection and therapy facilitate the avoidance of a prolonged ossification process.",

In addition there was a missing fifth ray at the right foot. Range of motion was the same for both feet at physical examination. Radiographs first showed a BSA on the right side. There was a fusion of talus, navicular, and calcaneum into one bone, and fusion of the second and third cuneiform. There were no further deformities. The mother denied use of drugs during pregnancy, and no similar case with absent toe or shortage of a leg is known in the family. Review of literature: Since the first description, 206 instances of the BSA have been reported in 175 patients. In 80 % of cases the deformity is single-sided with a preference for the right side (right : left = 2 : 1, P < 0.001). Male sex predominates (male : female = 2 : 1). In only one case was familial occurrence supposed. In common, symptoms related to the ankle are rare; only 2 % of the patients presented with an instability of the ankle and 3 % with pain. Few degenerative changes occur in the BSA. Mean age at diagnosis was 10 years (range 2-50 years). In most cases associated deformities were the chief complaint. Associated abnormalities: -Eighty-eight percent shortage of the leg at the same side, the tibia is more affected than the femur. In 80 % of cases of femoral shortage the lateral part of the femur is more affected than the medial, resulting in a slight valgus alignment of the knee. -Hypoplasia of the fibula or elevation of the lateral malleolus is common. -Deformities of the foot: 11 club feet, 14 congenital flat feet, nine metatarsus adductus varus (4 of 5 patients bilateral). -Eighty percent tarsal synostoses, thereof 72 % talo-calcanear, sometimes including the navicular and the cuboid, 18 % talo-navicular without inclusion of the os calcis. Cases without synostoses include some deformities of the subtalar joint wiht reduced mobility. Often there are fusions between cuneiforms or bases of metatarsals. -Fify-five percent oligodactyly; in most cases the fifth ray is missing, never the first ray. Aplasia of the second or the third ray is often combined with aplasia of the second or third cuneiform. Hypoplasia or fusion of two rays is rarely found. Conclusion: Our patient was quite a typical case of BSA, as he showed unilateral appearance, shortage of the leg, missing lateral ray, a large fusion in the hindfoot and fusion of two cuneiforms. Callus distraction was performed to correct the length discrepancy, and an instability in the ankle was treated with suitable shoes. oping an ependyma-lined tubular structure. This most caudal segment forms the conus medullaris, the filum terminale and a focal dilatation of the central canal, the ventriculus terminalis. From the 38 th day of gestation the cell mass and the central lumen decrease in size. We assume that the regression of the ventriculus terminalis takes a varying period of time and that it may therefore still be visible during the first weeks of life, seen most easily by spinal ultrasonography.",

These sequelae are of great concern both to the parents and to society. The purpose of our study was to analyse the neonatal risk factors for these problems in ELBW (< 1000 g) infants. In recent reports a possible association between strictures of the ascending colon in cystic fibrosis and high-dose pancreatic enzyme treatment was suggested [1, 2, 3] . We describe an infant with cystic fibrosis who presented with intestinal obstruction and a right lower quadrant mass. The sonographic and contrast enema findings were similar to those described previously. We also describe the CT findings. The patient was treated conservatively and feeding was resumed after 4 days. In contrast to previous cases described, our patient was always treated with conventional doses of pancreatic enzymes. This case further demonstrates that a cause and effect relationship still remains to be established before withdrawing what has so far proven to be a beneficial treatment.",

            "text": "Inversion of superior mesenteric (SM) vessels has been reported in malrotation, intraabdominal masses and, rarely, in normal children. There is no reported association of inversion of the SM vessels and intussusception. We report two infants (8 and 10 months old) with distal ileocolic intussusception and abnormal relationship of the two mesenteric vessels. Since the sonographic findings were atypical for intussusception, this sign was considered indicative of midgut malrotation with volvulus. At surgery a distal ileocolic intussusception was found (the intussusceptum was advanced into the sigmoid colon) and reduced. No midgut malrotation was found. Follow-up sonographic examination 4 months after surgery demonstrated a normal anatomic relationship of the SM vessels in both cases. It is concluded that an abnormal mesenteric vascular arrangement can arise in -among other circumstances -cases of distal ileocolic intussusception. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, can induce biliary pseudolithiasis which mimics true cholelithiasis both clinically and radiologically. This complication resolves spontaneously after discontinuation of the drug. We report a case of an 8-year-old boy who developed gallbladder pseudolithiasis and wall thickening 4 days after the initiation of ceftriaxone therapy. Serial ultrasound examinations and a plain X-ray of the abdomen verified the association of ceftriaxone intake with the development of increasing amount of pseudolithiasis (increasing calcium precipitation) and the gradual disappearance of lithiasis after discontinuation of ceftriaxone. To evaluate the impact of the available imaging modalities, we retrospectively reviewed the files of 11 patients with the final diagnosis of cystic mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (CMHL). They were collected over a 13-year period extending from April 1981 to December 1994. There were three girls and eight boys. Three times, antenatal US disclosed the hepatic cystic mass. In the other eight patients an abdominal mass led to the postnatal diagnostic work-up. Mean age at diagnosis in these patients was 15 months (SD 17 months, range 7 days to 57 months). Final diagnosis was supported eight times by surgical and pathological findings. In three patients, diagnosis relied only on clinical findings and imaging modalities. In two of these patients US survey showed disappearance of the mass respectively at 12 months and 3 years 10 months. The last patient was lost to follow-up. US was performed in every patient, CT in seven, angiography in six and MR in one. The hepatic origin of the mass was ascertained by US and CT. The mean CHML diameter was 8 cm (SD 6 cm, range 2.5-25 cm). In nine patients the mass was formed by the juxtaposition of fluid-filled micro-and macrocysts with septations. In two patients, there was a macrocystic unilocular lesion. In two patients there were several foci of CHML. No calcifications were found. Hepatic angiogram showed one or several avascular masses, with enhancement of the compressed surrounding normal hepatic parenchyma. No portal or hepatic vein thrombosis was found. CMHL is a rare condition. In the literature, biliary cyst, biliary cystadenoma and hepatic lymphangioma are other names for CMHL, which seems to be more a tissular dysplasia than a true tumoral condition. Differential diagnosis should include cavernomatous angioma, hepatoblastoma or hepatic mesenchymal sarcoma with central necrosis and nodular focal hyperplasia. Regarding evolution, in our patients two kinds of CMHL seemed to exist: on one hand, large CMHL revealed in young infants by abdominal mass which led to surgery, and on the other hand, small CMHL disclosed on prenatal or neonatal US which may regress. In this selected population, US follow-up may be an alternative to surgery. US is the most helpful imaging modality. It shows the lesion and strongly suggests the diagnosis of CMHL from the macrocystic pattern. However, the microcystic component may be falsely regarded as solid because of the high number of interfaces. CT and MR help in depicting the microcystic component of the CMHL and in evaluating the total extent of the lesion; they support US in the evaluation of the vascular relationships of the mass, which determine resectability. Angiography may still be useful in the case of a huge tumor closely related to the hepatic vein confluence or to the portal bifurcation.",

In the other three cases, the extra ribs were short and asymmetrical. Of seven patients with 13 pairs of ribs, five had five lumbar vertebrae and two had six lumbar vertebrae. Of seven with 12 pairs of ribs, two had six lumbar vertebrae, with no relation to age, gender or other combined anomalies.

Chromosome 8 trisomy syndrome and incontinentia pigmenti are also listed [1] as featuring \"supernumerary ribs\" but WS is not. It is well known that congenital cardiovascular anomalies are frequently combined with vertebral or rib anomalies. During the past year we have paid special attention to the number of ribs in ordinary chest films. In total, 7087 films were read and 13 pairs of ribs were found in five cases of tetralogy of Fallot, two cases of asplenia syndrome, two cases of pulmonary arteriel atresia with ventricular septal defect, and one case of ventricular septal defect, dextrocardia, DeLange syndrome and 4p-syndrome. In most cases, however, the 13 th ribs were asymmetrical or very short. The incidence of 13 pairs of ribs in these diseases was not as high as in WS. The first ribs of WS are normal in size and shape, and the extra ribs arise from the 13 th thoracic or the first lumbar vertebral body.

Extensive, bilateral adrenal masses were found, 4-5 cm in diameter, with mostly solid, partly mixed echostructure. The hormonal tests, with cushingoid features and clitoral hypertrophy, showed moderate cortisol and excessive androgen production, not suppressible by dexamethasone. At 4 months of age bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Unexpectedly, multiple, small focal liver masses were found and biopsied. A multicenter study of histological samples showed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and liver hemangiomatosis. Since operation, continuous hormone substitution has been administered, and the cushingoid features and clitoral hypertrophy have disappeared. During the follow-up, ultrasound and CT scan showed a moderate increase in number of the liver lesions. The diagnostic and therapy of this extremely rare combination, hormonal active adrenal hyperplasia and multiple liver hemangiomatosis, will be discussed.

Craniofacial fasciitis is a tumor-like fibroblastic lesion. Only nine cases of cranial fasciitis and one case of facial fasciitis have been reported in children. The ages of these reported cases ranged from newborn to 6 years of age, mean 18 months. We present a 15month-old white male with facial fasciitis. He was presented with a 2-month history of gradually increasing right infraorbital mass. The preoperative CT of the face showed a soft tissue mass with dense curvilinear calcification in the outer rim in the right infraorbital region anterior to the maxillary sinus. No bony destruction or inflammatory changes in the sinuses or orbit were present. The lesion was completely resected surgically. The pathology showed that the tumor consisted of a loose, haphazard proliferation of spindle-to stellate-shaped fibroblasts set in a myxoid matrix. The immunohistochemical studies showed positive for vimentin and negative for desmin, HHF-35, actin and S-100, which made the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma or a neurogenic tumor unlikely. The electron microscopic study showed spindle cells with a feature of fibroblastic differentiation. The postoperative MR showed no residual tumor. The patient did well without recurrence of tumor. Portal hypertension and a change in the direction of the portal flow are known to occur associated with irreversible damage of the liver parenchyma. The portal flow can be reliably examined by colour Doppler ultrasound. Although the change of the direction of the portal flow is usually thought to be permanent, we present a case in which the portal flow direction returned to normal after 2 years. We present Doppler curves with the arterial flow visible in the background, verifying the direction of the portal flow. Acute myeloid leukemia was diagnosed in a 10-year-old boy in March 1991. The patient was in remission after two courses of chemotherapy. He had several infection episodes during neutropenia, and in April ultrasound examination revealed a large, slightly hyperechoic liver, enlarged kidneys and splenomegalia. Later focal lesions developed in liver, spleen, kidneys and pancreas. Hepatosplenal candidiasis was confirmed by liver biopsy. Despite long term amphotericin-B therapy, the liver contracted and showed an irregular echo pattern as well as focal lesions, which later became more echogenic while several new lesion appeared in the spleen. In August 1992 ascites was seen on ultrasound, and afterwards the amount increased rapidly. Three months later the portal flow was noted to have changed its diretion away from the liver. A month later esophageal varices were diagnosed and were later treated several times. The spleen was removed because of persistent infection in it, and thereafter the patient slowly improved. The liver still remained grossly abnormal in the repeated ultrasound examinations. More than 3 years after the onset of the infection the portal flow was seen to have changed towards the liver again. The amount of the ascites was very small and no new varices emerged. Although the infection caused irreversible liver damage, the change of the direction of portal flow is not necessarily irreversible. Introduction: Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are known to have testicular lesions due to ectopic adrenal rests. Sonography permits the identification of such lesions [1, 2] . To our knowledge, only patients older than 12 years are presented in the literature [3] . We report the case of an 11-year-old patient with CAH (21OHD). Sonography performed because of poor response to therapy, showed adrenal rests in both testits. Case report: A 7-year-old patient with CAH (21OHD), treated since the age of i month, was referred to our clinicians for evaluation of therapeutic response. US examination of testis was negative. When the patient was 11 years old, due to therapeutic response worsening, a sonographic examination was performed with a mechanical, anular multifrequency probe, 7/13 MHz (Toshiba). Near the mediastinum testits some rounded, hypoechoic, well-marginated areas were detected (diameters 4-8 mm on the right, 3-6 mm on the left). These findings were considered adrenal rest tumors and therapy was modified; a new follow-up sonographic examination of testis was scheduled.",

Post partum the arterial system of the placentas was infused with BaSO 4 suspension for 30min under constant pressure of 100 mm Hg. Repeated X-ray images were taken with the umbilical cord in different positions. After fixation the placentas were sectioned and perpendicular pictures were made. Anastomoses that could not be clearly classified by X-ray images only were dissected under a stereo microscope. Results: An anastomosis could be identified in 65 of 69 placentas. In 53 instances the anastomosis was represented by a true vessel, whereas in five it was represented by a fenestration between the two arteries. In another three the umbilical arteries coalesced. In four cases anastomosis could not be classified. The anastomosis was truly absent in three cases. Another case had a single umbilical artery. In 25 of 61 classified cases, one of the umbilical arteries branched before the anastomosis, and in one case both did so, whereas in the remaining 35 instances the anastomosis was between the two main arteries. The occurrence and type of anastomosis were not found to be related to blood flow waveforms or fetal growth. The anastomosis was localized to within the umbilical cord at a maximum of 20 mm from the insertion in six cases, to the cord insertion in 48 cases and in tile placental surface in 11 cases. The length of the anastomosis varied between 0 and 17 mm and the diameter between 0.5 and 6 mm. Neither the length nor the diameter was related to blood flow or fetal growth. Conclusions: An anastomosis between :the umbilical arteries was found in more than 90 % of all placentas. In no case was more than one anastomosis found. The type and size was highly variable but showed no relation to blood flow or fetal outcome. Hyrtl's anastomosis explains the similarity in blood flow waveforms between the two umbilical arteries.",

Discussion: The results of this study indicate that hyaline FHC gradually decreases in thickness during growth, as the deposition of new epiphyseal bone proceeds with age. This phenomenon is substantiated by the very strong correlation between the thickness of FHC and the chronological and skeletal ages. Although it is not definitely proven whether the FHC can be used as index of biological maturity, it is reasonable to assume that changes in the thickness of the articular cartilage are closely related to skeletal maturation. Further investigations are needed to expand the present series, assess the precision and accuracy of the method, determine racial and ethnic differences and confirm whether the depth of hyaline FHC may provide additional information on skeletal maturation. It seems that this new method can be used as a primary screening tool for developmental derangements in childhood or as an ancillary tool in cases in which skeletal age determination is difficult on conventional X-ray due to a discrepancy in maturity between the different bones of the left hand and wrist.",

Castriota-Scanderbeg, Department of Radiology, IRCCS \"CSS\", 71013, San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia, Italy Introduction: Ultrasound (US) has proved excellent in diagnosing many hip disorders of childhood and adolescence. Although increasing evidence exists that the anterior aspect of the cartilage of the femoral head (FHC) can be accurately imaged by US, little information is available concerning the extent of and changes in thickness of the FHC during the developmental age. This study was designed (1) to analyze the relationship between the thickness of the FHC and the degree of skeletal maturation in a pediatric population, and (2) to verify whether the measurement of the thickness of FHC may be used for bone age assessment. Materials and methods: US examination of the hips was performed in 213 subjects (99 boys and 114 girls), aged 1.9-14 years (mean 8.1 years, standard deviation 3.5 years). Seventy-four were scanned after they had undergone hand and wrist X-ray examination for osseous maturation by the Greulich and Pyle method. Chronological age, standing height and body weight were recorded for all subjects. Images were obtained using a real-time scanner equipped with a 7.5-MHz linear transducer. To avoid interobserver errors, all US examinations were carried out by the same person, without any comparison between the two sets of photographs. A single scan of each hip in every subject was obtained, using an anterior approach with the probe placed along the axis of the femoral neck. The FHC was defined as the width of the anechoic space between the ossified nucleus and cartilage surface, close to the epiphyseal side of the physeal plate. Correlation of the sonographic measurements with the independent variables chronological and We present the case of a boy aged 3 years, 5 months with a, to our knowledge, never previously listed association of an adrenocortical carcinoma and an abdominal ganglioneuroma. The patient was examined because of general seizures and hypertension. US examination of the kidneys, intravenous pyelogram and abdominal CT showed the presence of a right suprarenal mass (4.7 x 4.2 cm). A coexisting small soft tissue mass in the retrocrural and paracaval region was considered to be a lymphadenopathy. After exploratory laparotomy, the pathologic diagnosis of a right adrenocortical carcinoma and a prevertebral ganglioneuroma was made. Adrenocortical carcinomas are very rare and highly malignant tumors in childhood. Only 300 cases have been identified, 75 % of them in children under the age of 5 years. These neoplasms mostly have an active hormone secretion, tend to be locally aggressive, and metastasize to the lung, liver, lymph nodes and bone. In our case there was a misleading second retroperitoneal neoplasm which turned out to be a ganglioneuroma (a rare, benign neurogenic tumor arising from the sympathic ganglia). We present this unusual case because of the difficulty in radiological diagnosis. The imaging investigations and their findings are discussed and correlated with literature reports.",

Moreover, there was associated abnormality of pancreatic echostructure and hyperemic increase of gallbladder wall thickness. The familial history of this infant revealed hyperlipoproteinemia and allowed the understanding of the US findings: the intramural hyperechogenicity was an obstructive fatty infiltration of the pyloric wall.

The stationary flow may result in increased pressure in the IVC, the renal veins and therefore the left adrenal vein, resulting in rupture of fragile adrenal vessels and subsequent hemorrhage. Conclusion: Anatomical and physiological anomalies in fetal venous blood flow may explain the likely nonfortuitous association of antenatal IVC thrombus and left adrenal hemorrhage.Serial imaging of the liver in patients with glycogen storage diseaseC. E. Barnewolt, J. C. Share, J. 1. Wolfsdorf, Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA Purpose: Children with glycogen storage disease (GSD) are at risk for developing hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma. The pur-pose of this project is to review imaging in children with GSD to help guide screening. Materials and methods: Serial ultrasound (US) images of 35 patients with GSD were obtained. Each patient was followed up for an average of 6.6 years. Six children with focal liver lesions (FLL) on US had magnetic resonance (MR) studies. The US and MR studies were retrospectively reviewed to assess for focal lesions. Results: FLL on US showed three patterns: hypoechoic, hyperechoic or target-like. On MR, FLL had a low T1 and high T2 signal. While most FLL were seen on both MR and US, some were seen on only one study. Of the 13 patients (37 %) that developed FLL, the average age at recognition was 13 years (range 6-27 years). Conclusion: Based on clinical assessment, none of our group have developed hepatocellular carcinoma, but 37 % have at least one presumed adenoma, with the youngest patient being 6 years old.",

At 5 years of age all children underwent neuropsychological testing and a neurological examination. The data from the neonatal period were collected retrospectively. They included the social background of the family, duration of the pregnancy, birthweight, and several parameters from the first day of life and from the NICU treatment. The clinical risk index for babies (CRIB) score was calculated from these data for all infants. Cranial ultrasound was performed several times on all infants. Of the infants, 11% had neurological abnormalities, 16 % had retinopathy, 19 % had emotional disturbances, 17 % had delayed verbal development, 32 % had visuomotor abnormalities, and 20 % had slight to severe intellectual impairment. In 53 % of the infants, all these parameters were normal. Intellectual impairment was associated with severe intra-ventricular haemorrhage (IVH), low gestational age, low birthweight, and long respirator care. Logistic regression analysis indicated that third grade IVH and sepsis were the most important of these. Other outcome variables showed similar associations. However, neurological abnormalities were associated only with severe, fourth grade IVH.Persistent ventriculus terminalis in the newborn: sonographic findingsL Ga/3ner, K.M.Unsinn, University Children's Hospital, Innsbruck, AustriaSpinal ultrasonography of 200 newborns revealed a small ovaloid lesion of variable size (length 10 mm, diameter 2-5 mm) between the conus medullaris and the cauda equina in 20 patients. Spontaneous regression of the cyst could be observed in follow-up examinations during the first weeks of life. We suppose that this cyst corresponds to the ventriculus terminalis, the most distal dilated portion of the central lumen of the spinal cord. During embryogenesis the ectoderm forms the brain and the spinal cord by developing the neural plate, the neural folds and the neural tube.The most caudal portion of the spinal cord evolves from a caudal cell mass by canalisation and retrogressive differentiation.

Raba L6on, F-33076 Bordeaux C6dex, France; 2 Service de Radiologie et de Neurop6diatrie, CHU de Lille, F-59000 Lille, FranceBackground: Schizencephaly is a developmental disorder of cell migration, characterized by cortical surface clefts with may be uni-or bilateral and are most commonly located near the pre-and postcentral gyri. Material and methods: We studied the main clinical and radiological features of 15 patients with schizencephaly between 1982 and 1994. Eight of the affected patients were female and seven male. The presenting symptoms were nonspecific, including seizures, hemiparesis, tetraparesis and developmental delay. Seizures occurred in six patients. No infantile spasms or neonatal convulsions were observed. Seizures began between 1 and 12 years: these six patients had motor abnormalities and retardation. All six had partial and generalized seizures with predominant EEG epileptic activity localized on the side of the lesion: unilateral (3) and bilateral(3). All patients (15/15) had computed tomography (CT), and 11 also had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results and discussion: CT and MRI revealed evidence of schizencephaly in all cases. The cleft is usually oriented vertically from the midsylvian fissure area: unilateral (8), right (5), left(3), bilateral asymmetric(7). Five patients with epilepsy had diffuse heterotopia. Schizencephaly is an extreme variant of cortical dysplasia. The clefts are bordered by dysplastic gray matter. The clinical outcome of patients with schizencephaly is very variable. Mental retardation may be mild or severe. Seizures occur in only 40 % of patients. Motor dysfunction correlates with the locations of the clefts. the wall; to my knowledge an observation not previously reported. One should recognize the alimentary duplications as a rare but curable cause of abdominal symptoms on the basis of their typical, either double or, probably more characteristic, five-layer wall appearance.Reference1.

The pictorial essay is organized by large categories and includes key clinical and imaging features. Results: In children the presence of unusual fractures raises the question of underlying congenital or acquired conditions. Osteogenesis imperfecta, congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia, and osteopetrosis represent the first group. Pre-existing bone conditions may be tumor-like diseases or benign bone tumors (bone cyst, aneurysmal bone cyst, non-ossifying fibroma, enchondroma) or malignant bone neoplasms (Ewing's, osteosarcoma, metastatic neuroblastoma). The process of growth is at the basis of the third category, including apophysitis, stress fractures, fractures due to metabolic disease (rickets, storage disease) or to endocrine disorders like hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis related to hypercorticism (often iatrogenic). The fourth group combines fractures secondary to neurologic or neuromuscular disease and concerns primarily the limbs. The last category relates to circumstances following orthopedic or oncologic treatment. Conclusion: Children may have congenital as well as acquired bone weakness. Fractures may be the inital symptom of an underlying disease. Some entities bear some site specificity of the fractures (osteoporosis, fibrous dysplasia). Knowledge of the primary underlying process may lead to adjustment of the management plan and may alter the ultimate prognosis. The most frequently encountered problem in differential diagnosis is the issue of child abuse. Plain radiography is still the first modality used, before technetium scan, CT and quantitative bone densitometry. Purpose: To assess the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of epiphysis, growth plate and metaphysis in patients with osteochondrodysplasias. Material and methods: Eleven patients aged from 5 to 17 (mean 9) years were selected for the study: four patients affected by achondroplasia, four affected by hypochondroplasia and three affected by pseudoachondroplasia. On X-ray all patients had epiphyseal, growth plate and metaphyseal abnormalities in relationship with osteochondrodysplasias. All patients were studied with MRI (0.5 T). T 1-weighted (500/20) and T2-weighted (1800/25-80) spin echo sequences were obtained on knees in the sagittal or coronal plane. Slice thickness was 5 mm of 10 mm. Morphology and signal intensity of epiphysis, growth plate and metaphysis were evaluated on MRI. Results: MRI clearly detected epiphyseal, growth plate and metaphyseal alterations due to defects of growth, especially for cartilaginous structures. Signal intensities of epiphysis, cartilaginous epiphysis and growth plate and metaphysis were normal. Exstrophy of the bladder is an uncommon congenital abnormality of the urinary tract occurring in approximately 1 in 10,000-50,000 live births. The bladder abnormality may be part of a spectrum of visceral malformations that have been well documented and which include epispadias and cloacal exstrophy. Widening of the pubic symphysis is invariably present and is the hallmark plain radiographic feature. Little information can be found in the literature concerning other bone and joint abnormalities that may be present in these patients. We have reviewed the palvic radiographs of 44 patients with bladder exstrophy, 35 male and nine female (current age range 25-48 years). Premature degenerative changes in the hip joint were seen in 27 cases (61%). In addition, other bony abnormalities were seen in 29 patients (66%). These included transitional vertebrae, spina bifida occulta and unilateral or bilateral crescentic defects in the medial iliac crest which may be related to previous surgical procedures. The latter abnormality has not, to our knowledge, been previously described. The bone and joint abnormalities in bladder exstrophy are described. We discuss the clinical relevance of these findings in addition to possible mechanisms that may account for their occurrence. WS is an uncommon disease characterized by facial dysmorphism, aortic stenosis, hypercalcemia and renal, dental and osseous abnormalities. The patients present mental retardation with poor visuospatial and visuomotor capacities and relatively spared linguistic abilities. It is well known that patients with WS and those with Down syndrome (DS) may share some neurological abnormalities. The aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the anatomical aspects of WS by MR; (2) to compare features observed in WS to those of patients with DS. Ten patients with WS and 10 with DS were examined: age range was 9 months to 14 years in both groups. All patients with WS were found to have a poor cerebral development corresponding to microcrania, whereas the cerebellum was normal. By contrast, those with DS showed both structures equally affected. Other findings in our patients are summarized below: Vascular malformations of the spinal cord are considered uncommon lesions. In children symptoms start prior to the age of 16 in 50-60 % of cases, but the correct diagnosis is made in only 20 %. We present the case of a 10.5-month-old boy admitted with a sudden onset of hypotonia and hyporeflexia of the lower limbs. Lumbar puncture was performed and showed an elevated protein level and a high white and red blood cell count in the CSE MRI of the spinal cord demonstrated the presence of a medullopathy, a hemorrhagic lesion located in the conus and tortuous vessels posterior to the spinal cord. The diagnosis of arteriovenous fistula was proposed and confirmed by phase-contrast MRA. These findings were in agreement with the selective spinal angiogram: a direct arteriovenous fistula fed by the anterior spinal artery was visualized. At a distance from the fistula, the draining vein carried an aneurysm complicated by a pseudoaneurysm. The lesion was treated by surgical ligation of the supplying artery at the level of the fistula. MRI, MRA and angiography were repeated after surgery and demonstrated that treatment had been successful. Spinal cord arteriovenous fistulas are high-flow lesions located in the subpial space. The presentation of these lesions is most frequent in children and characterized by chronic venous congestion and progressive neurologic deficit. Prognosis is poor without treatment. The presence of a ruptured aneurysm on the venous outflow site causing intramedullary hemorrhage is a rare feature in this pathology. MRI is the imaging technique to be used first whenever a spinal cord arteriovenous malformation is suspected. Angiography depicts the exact vascular components and determines surgical or interventional therapy.",

RadiologicaI investigations revealed thoracic esophageal stenosis, confirmed by endoscopy. After iron replacement therapy both children completely recovered. The esophageal stricture disappeared. We will discuss the etiology, physiopathology and treatment, in children of this rare syndrome which is well known in adults under the name of Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Introduction: Ectopic adrenal rests (EAR) are known to be a possible finding in testes of male patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Some authors have proved their existence in CAH males by ultrasound investigations and were able to detect microscopic lesions in apparently normal testes [1, 2] . At present, to our knowledge, adrenal rests have been never detected by ultrasound (US) in ovaries of female CAH patients, although their existence has been hypothesised [3] . Case report: A 16-year-old girl with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21 OHD), treated with gtucocorticoids since the age of 1month, was referred because of poor control of the disease. Among the performed investigations, US of the pelvis (5 MHz sector probe) showed in both the ovaries some nodular hypoechogenic areas, of about 1 cm, surrounded by a thin, hyperechogenic \"halo\". The suspinion of the presence of EAR in the ovaries was confirmed by histologic studies. A US examination after a period of adequate treatment showed a reduction in size of the ovarian nodular areas with an enhance of the hyperechogenic \"halo\". Conclusions: US examination of adrenal rests has not been described in the ovary, although some authors were able to detect them in CAH males' testes. In this case, the US findings suggesting the presence of adrenal tissue were confirmed by histologic examination. In girls with CAH showing a poor hormonal control, we suggest performing a US scan of the pelvis in order to detect any ectopic adrenal tissue. As in CAH males, the presence of EAR probably causes a poor response to treatment and required a period of therapy with high glucocorticoid doses. Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors in children, and most are benign. We report a 14-year-old boy with hypertensive crises because of diffuse metastatic pheochromocytoma of the left adrenal gland. At presentation a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 was made because of typical cutaneous signs. The primary tumor, pulmonary and skeletal metastases were evident on a single conventional Xray film of the chest, as well as the underlying genetic disease itself, and were confirmed by helical CT scanning and at operation.

This is true also in cases with diastolic zero flow and when the placenta is remarkably asymmetrical as a consequence of either malformation or extensive infarction. This can be explained by the existence of an anastomosis between the two umbilical arteries. This anastomosis was first mentioned by B. S. Albin in 1748 and described in more detail in 1870 by the Austrian anatomist J. Hyrtl, after whom it is named. Risk pregnancies are today monitored by Doppler examinations of umbilical artery blood flow velocity waveforms. The aim of this study has been to investigate the occurrence and appearance of Hyrtl's anastomosis and to relate it to blood flow waveforms and fetal growth. Method: Sixty-nine pregnancies at risk for small growth for age (SGA) were monitored by Doppler registration of the umbilical ar-",
