The complex and dynamic microbiota has a significant influence on the physiology, nutrition, and immunity of the human body. Disruptions of these human-associated microbial communities or alterations of the close relationships among these microbes and human cells can lead to many health problems. Now, increasing attention is being paid to the connection between the dynamics of the human microbiome and human health, from infectious disease to wound healing, metabolic homeostasis, and oral health. This field is attracting the attention of scientists and physicians worldwide (Bruls and Weissenbach, 2011, Proctor, 2011, Qin et al., 2010, Round and Mazmanian, 2009, Thomas and Ockhuizen, 2012).",

The healthy mouth environment harbors more than 700 bacterial species (Aas et al., 2005). Oral microbes are an important part of the human microbiome, and the unique and diverse microflora, distributed in various oral ecological niches such as the tongue dorsum and the periodontal crevice and pockets, are indispensable. The dynamic ecological balance between the oral microflora and the human body is important to maintain health. And the oral microflora is closely involved in development of oral diseases such as tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (periodontitis). Maintenance of oral hygiene plays an important part in preventing disease caused by the oral microbiota. Further, understanding the microflora by studying the oral microbiome is of benefit to maintain oral health, avoiding such conditions as caries and periodontal disease, which can be prevented by interfering with the oral microflora (Avila et al., 2009, Zarco et al., 2012).",

Under healthy conditions, the biofilm plays an essential role in resistance to mechanical damage or antibiotic treatment. Biofilm microbes can be targeted by pathogenic microorganisms in oral niches, or under circumstances such as poor oral hygiene. Gram-positive facultative anaerobes (Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces naeslundii) (Ruby and Barbeau, 2002) are the main components of these biofilms, but under conditions of poor hygiene, the percentage of Gram-negative species (for example, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas spp.) (Raghavendran et al., 2007) in the biofilms increases, and may lead to periodontal inflammation and thus affect negatively the overall health of an individual.

Clinical studies have shown that microflora in the mouth may be associated with caries, periodontal disease, respiratory infection, and intestinal disease. Invasive dental procedures can lead to bacteremia from the oral cavity, which may subsequently spread to the brain, liver, and lungs. Further, several studies suggest that periodontitis may have an association with systemic diseases such as coronary artery disease and low birth weight, and with distant-site infections such as infective endocarditis (Bahrani-Mougeot et al., 2008). Raghavendran and colleagues (2007) showed that periodontal disease may contribute to the initiation and/or progression of certain lung diseases. In fact, several anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected lungs and respiratory pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, have been found in periodontal pockets. These microorganisms have been found to be present in substantial numbers on the teeth in both the institutionalized elderly and intensive care patients.",

Such variation in the gut microbiota influences the body metabolism, leading to, for example, obesity and/or diabetes.

They studied 113 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; \u201cphylotypes\u201d) and found them to belong to six bacterial divisions, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Acidobacteria, that were different in terms of core members from the gut microbiome. Furthermore, this study found that when considering bacterial community membership and structure, interpersonal variation is approximately equal to intrapersonal variation, indicating a low level of individual variation, at least in healthy people. Subsequently, they generated 112,283 near-full-length bacterial 16S gene sequences from samples of 20 diverse skin sites on each of 10 healthy humans, and found that physiologically comparable sites harbor similar bacterial communities (Grice et al., 2009).

Thus, as sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools advance, a whole-genome shotgun (WGS) strategy presents a powerful alternative to rRNA sequencing and is becoming popular in metagenomics study, promising to provide the complete functional repertories of bacterial genomes. Genomic DNA was randomly broken up into small fragments, which are sequenced to obtain reads. Multiple reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing amplification and sequencing. Then the reads were assembled into continuous sequences by computer programs. DNA reads generated by this type of metagenomic sequencing can be assembled into longer composite sequences by reads overlapping or even complete genomes, and could also be considered directly as environmental gene tags (EGTs), the short sequences from the DNA of microbial communities that contain fragments of functional genes. While such a vast amount of information can be produced from a metagenomic sample by WGS sequencing, suitable bioinformatics tools are still needed to, for example, reconstruct bacterial genomes, explore taxonomic diversity genome-wide, annotate genomes (and community metagenomes) in terms of functional composition, and carry out association studies between microbiome diversity and phenotypes.",
