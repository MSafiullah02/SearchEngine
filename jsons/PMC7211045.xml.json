As Chow and Chang [12] observed, the study protocol is \u201cthe most important document in clinical trials, since it ensures the quality and integrity of the clinical investigation in terms of its planning, execution, conduct, and the analysis of the data.\u201d Protocols, typically reviewed by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs), are comprehensive plans of action that contain information concerning the goals of the study, and details of participant recruitment, safety monitoring, and all aspects of study design, methodology, and statistical analysis. As noted in the guidance, \u201cchanges in a protocol are typically not implemented before review and approval by the IRB/IEC and in some cases, by FDA\u201d [10]. However, these are not typical times, hence the release of this guidance.",

Documentation of specific information explaining the basis for missing data should be summarized in the trial\u2019s Clinical Study Report as it will be helpful to the FDA.",

With respect to efficacy assessments, FDA\u2019s recommendation is for sponsors to consult with the appropriate review division regarding protocol modifications for the collection of efficacy endpoints, such as employment of virtual assessments, delays in assessments, and alternate collection methods for research-specific specimens, if feasible. Additionally, if protocol changes will cause amended data management and/or statistical analysis plans, sponsors should similarly consult with the appropriate review division.",
