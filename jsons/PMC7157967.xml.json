There is a lack of insight into the determinants of host bio-aerosol emission and spread of established and emerging pathogens. The importance of identifying means by which to control potentially infectious bio-aerosols was underscored by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, where the burden of illness and death was largely borne by healthcare workers.[1,2] Part of the chaos which characterized the SARS-CoV epidemic can be attributed to a lack of knowledge regarding the route(s) of transmission of SARS-CoV and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Unfortunately, a similar scenario unfolded more recently in Saudi Arabia and South Korea where Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spread within healthcare institutions.[3,4] Also, the first case of confirmed MERS-CoV in North America was in a healthcare worker.[5] The attack rate for HCWs working in units caring for MERS patients was 8% in one study, with radiology technologists, respiratory therapists, and nurses being at highest risk; 90% of these individuals reported being within 2 m of an infected patient.[6] Extensive environmental contamination during the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea was demonstrated,[7] which may in part explain super-spreading events for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.[8]",

Where there is doubt, both droplet and airborne precautions are generally employed. Large respiratory droplets are >10 \u00b5m in diameter and are involved in short-range (\u22642 m) droplet spread. Droplet nuclei are \u22645 \u00b5m and are responsible for short- or long-range (>2 m) airborne transmission;[15] these respirable particles are small enough to be inhaled into the alveoli. The relative contribution of each route to overall transmission of influenza is unknown, leading to debate regarding the important mode(s) of transmission and appropriate means of transmission prevention.[16,17] In this paper, we use the term bio-aerosol to denote particles of any size presumed to originate from the respiratory tract.",

As part of routine care, mid-turbinate (MT) swabs (Copan, Murrieta, CA, USA) were collected from individuals with fever and either cough and/or sore throat, and (a) requiring admission to hospital or (b) are residents in long-term care. These were submitted for analysis using the xTAG RVP FAST v2 (Luminex, Toronto, ON, Canada) multiplex PCR assay for respiratory viruses, which includes targets for influenza A (subtypes H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses. Inclusion criteria included laboratory-confirmed influenza with PCR assay median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of >500, <48 hr since MT swab obtained, and ability to consent. The minimum MFI was arbitrarily set at >500 to optimize air sampling yield, given the limited number of instruments and personnel available.

These provided a minimum of four to six air exchanges per hour, with variable proportions of recycled air depending on unit location. Negative pressure, isolated HEPA-filtration and increased air exchange were not routinely applied. Area air samples in proximity to patients were collected using the NIOSH two-stage cyclone bio-aerosol sampler (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, WV, USA).[18] This instrument consists of stages which collect particles >4 \u00b5m into 15 mL conical tubes (stage 1) or 1\u20134 \u00b5m into 1.5 mL conical tubes (stage 2); particles <1 \u00b5m were recovered on a 3.0 \u00b5m pore size, 37 mm, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filter (Millipore, Etobicoke, ON, Canada) housed in a three-piece cassette.

The substantial variability in patient emissions of viral RNA compounded the limited sample size, further impeding the possibility of identifying significant associations. Individual host differences and sampling during differing points in patients\u2019 clinical course depending on time of presentation likely contributed to this variability, despite sampling patients within a strict time frame relative to presentation to hospital. The time from onset of symptoms varied and was not included in the analysis. We recovered viral RNA from the breathing zone of one of seven participating HCWs, but did not record the specific activities undertaken during the sampling period; it is unknown exactly how much time HCW participants spent in close proximity with patient participants. Similarly, patient participant activities were not monitored and we did not record expulsion events such as coughing. No restrictions on visitors were placed during the sampling period, thus the possibility that household members or other visitors may have contributed viral RNA to the air is not excluded. We did not record the presence of other patients with influenza on the unit, or illness in staff, which may have contributed to detection of viral RNA, particularly in the corridor. Exact air exchanges/hour, ventilation direction, and flow rates were not determined and may have affected the particle distribution in the room and corridor. Also, although patient participants were on droplet precautions, consistency of door closure was not noted. Although these are important limitations, data collected under these uncontrolled conditions reflect that of the real world where other patient and HCW exposures actually occur. As with the majority of studies of this nature, we detected viral RNA, which is not a definitive indication of potential risk of infection after exposure. Experimental studies suggest that viable virus concentrations are several-fold lower than detected RNA copy concentrations.[33] In the clinical setting, differences may be due to technical or mechanical factors related to sampling and disruption of the viral envelope, or may be attributable to other biological factors, including the shedding of defective interfering viral particles (DI particles).[34] The role of DI particles in influenza virus transmission remains unclear, though there is evidence for a role in the transmission of other viruses.[35] As it stands, demonstration of infectious virus from aerosol samples remains the most convincing evidence for transmission potential. Even if viral RNA were to become a reliable indicator of exposure, translating these results to manage and reduce risk requires significantly more research, since little is known about transmission potential for given quantities of virus shed into the air.[36] Finally, this study represents a single center during a single influenza season. Although the sampling window included the influenza peak, the bulk of the sampling was done in February. Whilst H3N2 viruses predominated early in this particular season, H1N1 viruses emerged later and predominated the entire season. This is reflected in Table 1 showing that the majority of recruited participants were infected with H1N1 virus.",

In one risk analysis, between 34,150 and 151,300 occupationally-acquired cases of influenza are estimated to occur annually in the United States.[37] Inconsistent application of infection prevention and control measures by both HCWs and patients has been studied, and there are opportunities for improvement among these groups, as well as from an administrative perspective.[38\u201340] The recovery of viral RNA in droplet nuclei and beyond 1 m from naturally-infected participants in the healthcare setting invites a concerted effort to address the issues of (a) virus viability and potential risk with exposure and (b) determinants of emission. The former poses methodological and technical challenges whereas the latter requires a collaborative, multidisciplinary and multicenter undertaking. A multicenter, multiseason study is required to determine the clinical, environmental, and viral factors associated with emission and dispersion of influenza virus. These issues can and should be addressed in order to generate the empiric data required to enhance evidence-based infection prevention and control and occupational health policies.",
