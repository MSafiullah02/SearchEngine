High quality serology is a key tool to understanding the spread of infection, immunity against the virus, and correlates of protection. Limited validation and testing of serology assays used for serosurveys can lead to unreliable or misleading data, and clinical testing using such unvalidated assays can lead to medically costly diagnostic errors and improperly informed public health decisions. Estimating prevalence and clinical decision making is highly dependent on specificity. Here, we present an optimized ELISA-based serology protocol from antigen production to data analysis. This protocol defines thresholds for IgG and IgM for determination of seropositivity with estimated specificity well above 99%. Validation was performed using both traditionally collected serum and dried blood on mail-in blood sampling kits, using archival (pre-2019) negative controls and known PCR-diagnosed positive patient controls. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed for the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses and no cross reactivity was observed with anti-influenza A H1N1 HAI titer during validation. This strategy is highly specific and is designed to provide good estimates of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a population, providing specific and reliable data from serosurveys and clinical testing which can be used to better evaluate and understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity and correlates of protection.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the globe rapidly causing a worldwide pandemic 1 . Infection with this highly contagious respiratory virus can be asymptomatic or present as COVID19, a disease with varying levels of severity that includes a broad range of not fully understood symptoms that may include fever, cough, anosmia, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypercoagulability, inflammatory complications, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as death 2, 3 . Due to the rapidly evolving nature of pandemics, the true extent of spread of SARS-CoV-2 will likely not fully be realized until late or after the pandemic. Moreover, as observed in all respiratory viral pandemics since 1918, the true number of infections always exceeds the detected cases 4, 5 . In order to determine a better estimate of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, high quality serology assays must be developed. These assays measure the presence of antibodies against specific proteins of this novel coronavirus to determine whether an individual has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and aim for high sensitivity and specificity 6, 7 . Both are important factors to clinically diagnose prior infection; however, if a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity is needed, high specificity should be emphasized when determining the extent of exposure across a population or for clinically diagnosing previous infections. If such a highly specific, high quality assay is available then data can be generated from serosurveys and clinical testing that can be used to better understand spread of infection, immunity, and correlates of protection.",

The NIH serosurvey study allows mail-in home sampling using dried blood on a microsampler or collection of blood on-site. Therefore we developed, implemented, and evaluated a serology testing protocol using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that could successfully be used with multiple sample types while emphasizing the necessary specificity required to conduct high quality convalescent testing and serosurveys (Figure 1) . Here we present an optimized ELISA-based serology assay protocol --from protein production to data analysis --that analyzes the presence of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies against spike and RBD antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. This protocol includes: steps for determining the possibility of cross reactivity against a panel of spike antigens from other beta-coronaviruses, control samples, and criteria for setting threshold cut points. A semi-automated protocol is also described that significantly increases throughput capacity.",

Little improvement in yield was seen with extended expression times. Although the Mt. Sinai and Ragon constructs differ significantly in their C-terminal tags and use different secretion signal peptides (native spike for Mt. Sinai, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for Ragon), the behavior of these proteins during purification was highly similar. SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, in contrast, were poorly secreted with yields of no greater than 2 mg/l in our hands, similar to reports in the literature 8, 9 . Improved production was seen at 96 hours versus 72 hours of expression; however, viabilities of cultures were very low after 96 hours, suggesting toxicity perhaps due to failures in the secretory pathway or activation of the unfolded protein response. Curiously, expression of other coronavirus spike proteins (SARS1, MERS, OC43, HKU1) consistently produced higher yields (5-11 mg/l) compared with CoV-2 for reasons that are still unclear. Purification of spike proteins was further complicated by significant protein loss during size exclusion chromatography. Ultimately, we chose to eliminate the SEC step and instead modified the IMAC purification conditions to produce higher purity material, followed by desalting to final buffer. This eliminated the protein loss during SEC and produced proteins that were similar in purity to those seen with the original protocol. Figure 2b shows the final purified proteins generated using the modified protocols. To verify that spike proteins formed the expected trimeric structures, analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed (Figure 2c ) and VRC and Mt.",

At a threshold of 2 standard deviations above the mean of the negative controls, estimated 98% specificity was noted on the spike assay, while at a threshold of 3 standard deviations above the mean (OD = 1.078), estimated 99% specificity was observed (Figure 3) . We repeated this assay for both IgM (OD = 0.405) and IgA (OD = 0.308), which resulted in estimated 100% and 99% specificity at 3 standard deviations above the mean. This was repeated with the RBD construct, where we observed 100% specificity for IgG (0.264), IgM (OD = 0.213), and IgA (OD = 0.723) at 3 standard deviations above the mean of the negative controls. Based on these data we propose using a threshold of 3 standard deviations above the mean of the negative controls for both the spike and RBD manual ELISA assays. Therefore the definition of seropositivity in our protocol requires positivity (above the threshold) of both spike IgG and RBD IgG or both spike IgM and RBD IgM. This definition provides a specificity of 100% (95% CI 96.4%, 100%) from our negative controls. With the accrual of further negative controls this can be fine tuned to thresholds to ensure specificity with a 95% lower confidence limit of at greater 99%. We are utilizing IgM and IgG to threshold seropositivity as early infection could be signaled with IgM+ but IgG-donors; however, we expect the majority of seropositive individuals to be IgG+.",

When directly comparing the OD of spike versus RBD, we saw a correlation for IgG (R 2 = 0.856) and IgM (R 2 = 0.961) (Figure 4b,d, Supplementary Figure 3) . The correlation of IgG was less than for IgM, and several points fell below the trendline when plotting spike as a function of RBD, suggesting that using spike alone risks overestimating overall intensity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody signal, which is predictable given the increased availability of antigenic sites on the full spike ectodomain and possible cross reactivity (Supplementary Figure 3b) . Including RBD in the protocol offers increased specificity reducing the risk of false positives, while including spike offers increased sensitivity able to capture a polyclonal response. Therefore, using these antigens individually risks false results, while together they provide the desired sensitivity and high specificity. Overall, we identified 37 undiagnosed COVID19 cases in this sample dataset (spike IgG+, RBD IgG+). Furthermore, as asymptomatic transmission has been reported 10 , we tested six additional samples that were sourced from donors from this high-exposure community that displayed no symptoms, and were able to detect antibody in four of the six samples tested (Figure 4f) .",

First, we developed optimized protein expression and purification methods that could reproducibly generate spike and RBD proteins of consistent yield and quality. While RBD production is fairly straightforward, production of properly folded trimeric spike proteins is considerably more challenging. Spike proteins, likely due to their heavy glycosylation, have a tendency to adsorb to membranes as well as purification media, requiring more complex methods to ensure consistent yield and quality. After experiencing significant protein loss during size exclusion chromatography using multiple purification resins, we decided to forgo this step and alter the preceding IMAC chromatography with a more complex elution scheme that minimized levels of contaminants and retained protein purity. This modified procedure has proved more consistent and allowed us to generate single large batches (>15 mg) of spike protein from 8 liters of cell culture media permitting thousands of assays to be run on a single qualified batch of protein. Attention to quality of protein production and purification is critical for running a validated and specific ELISA, as contaminants in impure protein preparations or unstable proteins can yield decreased specificity and sensitivity in the assay.",

            "text": "It is important to note that we developed this protocol with ease of adaptation by other labs in mind, and we focused on utilizing readily available reagents and instruments so that it could be applied easily in various resource settings. However, appropriate validation must be performed at each lab that adopts this protocol due to variances in equipment and reagents. These validations include determining the proper dilutions and building confidence intervals with positive and negative sample controls. This protocol, if validated and applied properly, can provide sensitive and highly specific data that are more reliable than those of binary threshold assays and can serve to develop a more complete understanding of humoral immunity. With further validation, this protocol will be implemented in our current NIH serosurvey and we believe that it could offer a consistent method for others performing similar studies or expanded clinical antibody testing in the future.",

As automated systems alter the conditions and timing and do not precisely replicate manual pipetting, we re-titered known PCR+ patient positive controls (n = 9) and archival negative controls (n = 8)representing the range of signal intensity (min to max) observed with both positives and negatives detected by the manual ELISA(Supplementary Figure 8). Given the biologic difference in the concentrations of IgG, IgM and IgA, and based on the balance between background signal and positive signal, we have found that a 1:1000 to 1:400 dilution for IgG results in clear signal with high positives (higher concentration in serum) and a 1:400 dilution for IgM and IgA analyses is necessary to capture all positives (lower concentration in serum). We re-validated these titers on sero-positive and sero-negative identified donors from our small-scale test-cohort using microsamplers loaded with donor blood then eluted as per standard protocol(Supplementary Figure 9). To ensure equal endpoint serum dilution, we use an equivalent dilution of microsampler eluate for IgG analyses (1:25 to 1:10, corresponding to 1:1000 to 1:400 serum dilution), and 1:10 for IgM and IgA analyses, equal to a 1:1000 and 1:400 serum dilution, respectively. To re-establish thresholds and sensitivity on our automated setup that will be used in future serosurvey work, we evaluated the robotic setup against 246 archival pre-2019 negative controls (SupplementaryFigure 10, 11). At a threshold of the mean of the archival controls plus three standard deviations we detect 0 false positives for IgG (thresholds: spike = 0.669, RBD = 0.432) and 1 false positive for IgM (thresholds: spike = 0.271, RBD = 0.277). Therefore the preliminary specificty for IgG is 100% (95% CI 98.5, 100.0) and the for IgM preliminary specificity of 99.59% (95% CI 97.8, 100.0). If we increase the threshold for IgM to 4",
