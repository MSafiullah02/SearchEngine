Within each trial, participants will be randomized 1:1 in parallel groups to receive hydroxychloroquine or placebo. This clinical trial was registered at Clinical Trials.gov (NCT04308668) on 16 March 2020 and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA; IND 148257) and Health Canada. Research ethics board (REB) approval was obtained at the University of Minnesota (16 March 2020), McGill University Health Centre Research Institute (1 April 2020), University of Alberta (6 April 2020), and University of Manitoba (25 March 2020), prior to recruitment of the first participant.",

To limit the spread of disease, no in-person visits with study personnel will be performed.

Study medications will be delivered directly to the participants\u2019 place of residence via courier services that respect safety protocols for home deliveries to patients with COVID-19. Participants can contact the local study teams in their region via email or phone for questions or concerns with timely responses (same day during business hours and the following day after 9 pm).

Healthcare workers are self-identified physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, or other workers providing direct patient contact.

All efforts will be made to deliver study medicines before the fourth day following exposure; however, delays may lead to symptom onset after randomization but prior to starting the intervention.

The novel web-based design of this trial, in the setting of a highly contagious global pandemic, has ensured that all interactions with participants, including enrolment and informed consent, are done remotely using courier services to deliver medicine and using internet-based follow-up. This will allow compliance with strict social distancing strategies and reduce risks of infectious spread to study personnel and others. The design encourages large scale enrolment to ensure the target number of participants are enrolled and trial results are obtained as quickly as possible. Importantly, the design was finalized, regulatory and REB approvals were obtained, and large geographic jurisdictions brought online in an unprecedently short duration (within a few weeks of a global pandemic) with a goal to obtain the maximal information in the minimal amount of time.",

If a null or negative effect is shown, this will reduce the risk of harm to future patients, reduce healthcare expenditures due to ineffective medications, and protect the drug supply for patients with previously established indications for hydroxychloroquine. The results of this trial will be instrumental in determining if hydroxychloroquine may play an important role in mitigating the global impact of COVID-19.",
