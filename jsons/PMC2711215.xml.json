            "text": "Type I interferons (IFNs) regulate diverse cellular functions by modulating the expression of a large family of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (Haque and Williams, 1998, Stark et al., 1998). ISGs subsequently influence multiple pathways involved in cell stress responses, apoptosis, and proliferation and mediate diverse immune effects (Goh et al., 1999, Goodbourn et al., 2000). The potent immune response elicited by IFNs is exemplified by the establishment of an antiviral state that enabled their original discovery (Isaacs et al., 1957). This state relies on the induction and activation of numerous intrinsic antiviral factors, most notably the Mx GTPases, the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate-synthetase (OAS) system, ISG15, and protein kinase R (PKR) (Sadler and Williams, 2008). In addition, IFNs modulate distinct aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity, affecting the activities of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and T cells by enhancing ISG expression profiles, cell differentiation, cell trafficking, and antigen presentation. Because of the numerous effects of IFNs, they have been used therapeutically against a variety of diseases, including viral infections, immunomodulatory disorders, and hematological and solid tumors (Borden et al., 2007). The factors determining the outcome of IFN treatment, however, are not understood, and IFN therapy has had variable success. Although the essential JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is well characterized, recent studies have revealed greater complexity in patterns of gene induction than initially envisaged (Chang et al., 2004, Tenoever et al., 2007, van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006). Here, we identified an IFN-mediated signal that leads to activation of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF, encoded by Zbtb16) transcription factor that has fundamental consequences for the immune response.",

Two recent reports describe a role for PLZF in the immune response as a transcription factor that is necessary for full function of natural killer T (NKT) cells (Kovalovsky et al., 2008, Savage et al., 2008), although the mechanisms were not investigated. Here, we present evidence that the role of PLZF in the immune response is broader than described in these reports. Contrary to the previous designation of PLZF as a repressor of transcription, we showed that PLZF was required for the induction of a subset of ISGs that are crucial in the ensuing immune response via the induction of the antiviral genes and other ISG functions, including NK cell activity. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of IFN-mediated immunity.",

            "text": "To determine the factors contributing to IFN sensitivity, we analyzed two renal cancer cell lines, differing markedly in their response to IFN (Holko and Williams, 2006), for their ISG profiles. Higher and more persistent expression of a subset of ISGs was noted in the IFN-sensitive RCC1 cells when compared with the relatively IFN-insensitive ACHN cells (\nFigure 1A). Correspondingly, RCC1 cells showed an increased IFN-mediated antiviral response (Figure S1 available online). No differences in established IFN-regulatory factors were apparent between the two cell lines (Holko and Williams, 2006). Therefore, to account for the differential regulation of this subset of ISGs, we analyzed the promoter proximal regions (1000 bp upstream of the ATG) for features that distinguished these genes from other ISGs that were synchronous between the two cell lines. It was found that genes differentially induced by IFN\u03b1 treatment in the RCC1 cells exhibited an overrepresentation of DNA-binding motifs for the PLZF protein (Table S1). Cluster analysis showed the putative PLZF-binding sites were in proximity to sites occupied by essential STAT and IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), increasing the likelihood that these motifs were biologically relevant (Figure S2). To test this correlation between expression of ISGs with putative binding motifs and expression of the transcription factor, we assessed both cell lines for their expression of PLZF by immunoblot analysis. Consistent with a role for PLZF in the IFN response, the IFN-sensitive RCC1 cells expressed higher amounts of PLZF than the relatively IFN-insensitive ACHN cells (Figure 1B).",

The ISG expression profiles of U937T:PLZF45 cells with and without tetracycline and IFN\u03b1 were examined. PLZF expression alone resulted in the induction of a subset of ISGs and this was further enhanced by IFN\u03b1 (Figure 1C and Table S2). The expression of representative ISGs was validated with real time RT-PCR (Figure 1D). Interestingly, an analysis of gene categories regulated by PLZF identified overrepresentation of immune response genes, particularly ISGs (Tables S3\u2013S5), suggesting a particular role for PLZF in mediating the immune response.",

Wild-type MEFs showed 100-fold greater IFN-mediated protection to infection with Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) than Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 MEFs (\nFigure 2A and Figure S3). The role of PLZF in the in vivo IFN-mediated antiviral response was assessed by infectious challenge of Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type neonatal mice. Mice were infected with SFV at ten times the half-maximal tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), and resistance to the virus was measured as survival after infection. The survival curve of infected Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice closely parallels the wild-type, with all mice of both genotypes dead by 3.5 days after infection (Figure 2B) (p > 0.05). Appropriately, IFN pretreatment of mice for 6 hr before exposure to SFV afforded significant protection to wild-type mice, with 60% of infected neonates (18 of 30) surviving past 22 days. In contrast, IFN pretreatment did not protect the Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice from SFV infection, with no survival beyond 6 days after infection (Figure 2B). Viral loads in the organs from Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type neonatal mice were measured 48 hr after infection with SFV. Consistent with the survival results, viral titers in the organs of Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, including the lung, thymus, spleen, heart and liver, were up to 1,000-fold greater than their wild-type littermates (Figure 2C).",

Notably, the serum IFN concentrations were not obviously deficient in infected Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (\nFigure 3A). This indicated that the observed virus susceptibility is independent of IFN production. The expression profile of a number of PLZF-dependent ISGs, identified in array experiments (Figures 1A and 1C and Table S2), was investigated ex vivo and in vivo. Importantly, the induction of the antiviral gene Oas1g by IFN was impaired in primary Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) (Figure 3B). Given that OAS1 is an established effector for the antiviral action of IFN, specifically against SFV (Borden et al., 2007, Pestka et al., 1987), we measured its expression in different organs after IFN treatment and SFV infection. The induction of Oas1g was markedly impaired in splenocytes isolated from the Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figures 3C\u20133E). Similarly, the antiviral ISGs Rsad2 (also termed Cig5 or Viperin) and Ifit2 (or Ifi54) were impaired in Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 BMMs (Figure 3B) and splenocytes (data not shown), or SFV-infected organs from Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figures 3C\u20133E). In keeping with the specificity of the PLZF response, expression of the PLZF-independent but IFN-regulated CCL5 (RANTES) transcript was not affected (Figure 3B). These data suggest that the increased susceptibility of Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice is due to a specific defect in the induction of antiviral genes.",

Both IFIT1 and IFIT2 are strongly induced by IFN or viral infecton and are impaired in STAT1-deficient mice. These two genes are reported to have contrasting expression patterns in different tissues (Terenzi et al., 2007). Both genes contain ISRE binding sites in their promoter, but there is no PLZF-binding motif in the Ifit1 promoter. Accordingly, Ifit2 induction was lost in the absence of PLZF, whereas Ifit1 was still induced by IFN\u03b1 in Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3F). Furthermore, analysis of the expression of PLZF in different tissues showed a strong correlation between PLZF expression and Ifit2 induction in response to IFN\u03b1 (Figure 3F). Hence, the different expression patterns of these two related ISGs probably depend upon their separate regulation by PLZF. Although expression of IFIT1 is largely independent of PLZF, a degree of PLZF dependence is noted in the lung of mice, suggesting that PLZF might still contribute indirectly to inducer-specific ISG regulation.",

CXCL10 was also markedly impaired in splenocytes, liver, and lung isolated from the SFV-infected Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figures 3C\u20133E).

            "text": "Two recent reports have shown that PLZF affects NKT cell activity (Kovalovsky et al., 2008, Savage et al., 2008). However, analysis of PLZF expression in immune cells with the human and mouse microarray database (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] accession number GSE 6887) revealed that PLZF was also expressed in human NK cells (Figure S4). Furthermore, we demonstrated that PLZF was expressed in mouse NK cells by sorting different spleen lymphocyte populations with FACS (NK1.1+CD3\u2212) and then analyzing their gene expression (\nFigure 4A). This analysis shows comparatively little expression in CD3+NK1.1\u2212 T cells and no detectable transcript in B cells. Consequently, we investigated the effect of the loss of PLZF on NK cell function. FACS analysis of splenocytes showed there were equivalent numbers of NK cells in wild-type and Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, with NK cells constituting 2%\u20133% of total splenocytes (Figure 4B). We investigated the effector function of NK cells from wild-type and Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice by testing their cytolytic activity against the NK-sensitive target cell line YAC-1 (Fehniger et al., 2007, Shey and Ballas, 2008). After treatment with poly(I:C), which activates NK cells through the IFN\u03b1 signaling pathway, Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 NK cells were impaired in their ability to spontaneously lyse YAC-1 cells (Figure 4C, top panel). Moreover, when activated in vivo with IFN\u03b1, the ability of Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 NK cells to subsequently lyse YAC-1 target cells was also markedly impaired (Figure 4C, bottom panel). These results demonstrate that PLZF is required for NK cell effector function and also suggest that PLZF may regulate the expression of target genes involved in NK cytolytic activity. Given that cytokine-induced activation of NK cells results in a dramatic increase in the expression of Granzyme B (GzmB), we examined the ability of poly(I:C) and IL-2 to induce GzmB protein expression in murine splenic NK cells. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with poly(I:C) or PBS, and splenic NK cells were analyzed after 24 hr for GzmB expression by flow cytometry. Wild-type spleens of poly(I:C)-injected mice had a markedly higher percentage of NK cells positive for GzmB than spleens of Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 4D). The reduced amount of GzmB is consistent with a reduced ability to lyse target cells. Activation of NK cells in vitro with IL-2 induced equivalent amounts of GzmB in either genotype (data not shown). Therefore, the role of PLZF in the induction of GzmB is through IFN\u03b1, rather than other cytokines.",

Promoter regions from the PLZF-regulated transcripts Rsad2 and Ifit2 were fused to luciferase and activity was measured after IFN treatment. Overexpression of PLZF in RCC1 or ACHN cells produced a dose-dependent induction of the reporter promoters. This effect was further enhanced by IFN\u03b1 treatment (\nFigures 5A\u20135C). Correspondingly, induction of the Rsad2 promoter was impaired in cells with PLZF expression reduced by RNA interference (Figure 5D). Reporter constructs confirm the requirement to colocate ISRE and PLZF-binding sites in the promoters of PLZF-regulated ISGs (Figure S6). A direct association of PLZF with the promoters of Rsad2 and Ifit2 was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in the RCC1 and U937T:PLZF45 cell lines. Moreover, the association of PLZF to the Rsad2 and Ifit2 promoters was dramatically enhanced by IFN treatment (Figure 5E and Figure S7).",

            "text": "The observed IFN-enhanced association of PLZF with select ISG promoters could occur through direct posttranslational modification of PLZF and/or modification of transcriptional cofactors. To investigate the former possibility, we immunoprecipitated PLZF from control and IFN\u03b1-treated U937T:PLZF45 cells and probed the acetylation or phosphorylation state of the protein by immunoblotting. Although acetylation has been reported to be important for DNA binding of PLZF (Guidez et al., 2005), no change in the acetylation state was detected (data not shown). However, PLZF was found to be phosphorylated at serine and tyrosine residues, with tyrosine phosphorylation correlating with temporal treatment with IFN\u03b1 (\nFigure 6A). PLZF encodes two types of conserved domain, a BTB domain at the N terminus and nine repeated zinc finger domains at the C terminus. Because BTB domains have been shown to be crucial for homodimerization and protein-protein interaction (Dong et al., 1996), we chose to focus on residues within this domain. Through alignment of the amino acid sequence of PLZF with BTB domains from various other proteins and by analysis with prediction programs (NetPhos 2.0, Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark), several putative phosphorylated residues within the BTB domain of PLZF were identified along with residues previously shown to be crucial for PLZF to function as a transcriptional repressor (Figures S8\u2013S10). We mutated residues in PLZF to test their significance in the IFN\u03b1-mediated induction of the Rsad2 promoter. This approach identified the tyrosine at position 88 and a serine residue at amino acid 76 to be important for induction of Rsad2 (Figure 6C). Consistent with these promoter reporter assays, phosphorylation analysis of the full-length mutant protein (S76A) indicated that the residue at position 76 was the sole phosphoserine residue of importance in IFN-mediated activation (Figure 6B). Two additional mutations, R49D and L103E, which had previously been demonstrated to constitute important structural components on either surface of the BTB domain, had opposing effects upon ISG induction. As anticipated, the L103E mutation impaired activation of Rsad2. Surprisingly, mutation of R49 induced the Rsad2 reporter. Although the structure of the charged pocket that surrounds the R49 residue had been demonstrated to be critical for PLZF to function as a transcriptional repressor, these results suggest that other residues of the BTB domain on the lateral surface, where L103 lies, may be more pertinent to the role of PLZF as a transcription inducer.",

Accordingly, we sought to measure IFN-induced changes in known PLZF cofactors. Transcriptional repression by PLZF is sensitive to inhibitors of deacetylation, and PLZF physically interacts with both class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs) via the BTB domain (Ahmad et al., 1998, Chauchereau et al., 2004, David et al., 1998). In accord with a requirement for HDAC activity for transcriptional activation of ISGs by PLZF, treatment of cells with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) blocked induction of selected ISGs in the PLZF-inducible U937T:PLZF45 cells or BMMs (\nFigures 7A and 7B). An association between the class I histone deacetylase HDAC1 and PLZF was shown by coimmunoprecipitation of overexpressed FLAG-tagged PLZF in HEK293 cells. Notably, an association with the class II histone deacetylase HDAC4 was not detected under the same conditions (Figure 7C). This association between PLZF and HDAC1 was confirmed with endogenous protein under more physiologically relevant conditions in primary BMMs (Figure 7D). As an additional measure of co-operation between PLZF and HDAC1, the effect of coexpressing PLZF and HDAC1 upon the Rsad2 reporter was measured in IFN-responsive RCC1 cells. Appropriately, coexpression of PLZF with HDAC1 enhanced the induction of the ISG promoter by IFN\u03b1 to a greater degree than that observed with either protein expressed alone. Moreover, treatment with TSA blocked the additive effect of PLZF and HDAC1 (Figure 7E).",

Of relevance to this study, PML mediates the formation of nuclear bodies that are crucial in the IFN response. More directly, it has been established that the antiviral response is reduced in PML-deficient MEFs (Day et al., 2004). To determine whether PML is a cofactor in PLZF-mediated activation of ISGs, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays on lysates from the IFN-responsive HeLa cells, overexpressing PLZF-tagged constructs, or on endogenous PLZF from primary BMMs. PLZF was found to interact with PML in both cell types after IFN\u03b1 treatment (Figures 7F, 7G; Figures S12 and S13). Importantly, PML has been demonstrated to alter the cellular location of PLZF (Koken et al., 1997). To show whether the association between PLZF and PML, detected by immunoprecipitation, correlated with colocalization of the proteins within nuclear bodies, we performed confocal microscopy with fluorescently tagged proteins in RCC1 cells treated with or without IFN\u03b1. Indirect immunofluoresence confirmed that PLZF localized with PML after IFN stimulation (Figure 7H). The reported induction of PML by IFN does not account for the observed colocalization, given that the amounts of PML did not significantly increase over the duration of this experiment (Figure S14). Together, these data show that IFN treatment induces phosphorylation of PLZF, plausibly by JNK, and interaction with both HDAC1 and PML to mediate association of the complex with PLZF-binding sites in gene promoters to induce specific ISGs.",

The response via the canonical JAK-STAT pathway alone is not sufficient to explain all the biological effects of type I IFN. Accordingly, other kinases, including PI3K and MAP kinase, lead to the activation of additional transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1, IRFs, and PU.1, which interact with STATs at interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) via ISGF3 or other IRFs to regulate ISGs. We showed that the transcription factor PLZF is a regulator of the IFN response. PLZF induced a specific subset of ISGs with PLZF-binding sites in proximity to ISRE. Gene array, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and promoter reporter experiments demonstrated that PLZF directly occupied these select promoter sequences and that this activity was IFN dependent. In this study, analysis of all genes induced by PLZF showed a predominance of ISGs, explicitly implicating PLZF in positively modulating the IFN pathway.",

The mechanism for transcriptional repression by PLZF is thought to involve constraint of the accessibility of the gene to transcriptional machinery, via chromatin remodeling by acetylation involving the nuclear corepressor complex (NCoR) and HDACs, particularly HDACs 1 and 4 (Chauchereau et al., 2004, David et al., 1998, Guidez et al., 2005, Hong et al., 1997, McLoughlin et al., 2002). Although HDACs are generally considered as corepressors, HDAC1 could serve as a coactivator for the glucocorticoid receptor (Qiu et al., 2006). More relevant to our findings, we and others found that inhibition of HDAC1 perturbed IFN-induced transcription and antiviral responses. Moreover, data generated from HDAC1-deficient cells show that this protein is required for the efficient activation of ISGs (Chang et al., 2004, Zupkovitz et al., 2006). Also, HDAC1 but not HDAC4 associated with STAT1 and STAT2 to positively activate expression of the ISG3-dependent transcriptional response. Correspondingly, we detect an association between PLZF and HDAC1, not HDAC4, upon stimulation with IFN\u03b1, leading us to propose that HDAC1 is key to PLZF's role as a transcriptional enhancer. Similarly to HDAC1, a second PLZF cofactor, PML, is indispensable for the IFN response (Handwerger and Gall, 2006). Appropriately, PML is induced by IFN through an ISRE and an IFN-\u03b3 activation site (GAS) motif in its promoter, and the number and intensity of nuclear bodies increase in response to IFN (Stadler et al., 1995). More directly, it has been established that the antiviral response is reduced in PML-deficient MEFs (Day et al., 2004). We demonstrate here that PLZF and PML associate and that this interaction is also modulated by IFN.",

            "text": "Although the precise mechanism modulating the association between PLZF and its cofactors has not been established, it is predicted to be mediated by the BTB domain of PLZF (Melnick et al., 2000b). This domain acts as a homodimerization motif that is essential for the repressor function of PLZF and its localization in nuclear bodies. (Melnick et al., 2000a) Our results suggest that this domain is also key for its transcriptional enhancer function. However, our observations indicated differences in how the BTB domain mediates repressor or enhancer activities of PLZF. Mutation of the residue at position 49 in the BTB domain of PLZF, shown to be essential for repressor activity, had the contradictory effect of further enhancing ISG expression. Mutation of another key structural residue, on the lateral face of the BTB domain at position 108, recapitulated the loss of function as a repressor. This implies that different regions of PLZF mediate repressor or enhancer functions. Because we found an interaction between PLZF, PML, and HDAC1 only after IFN stimulation, it seems likely that IFN signaling affects the state of one or all of these proteins. Informatively, the apparent paradoxical function of HDAC1 as a corepressor or coactivator appears to be regulated by acetylation of the protein itself (Melnick et al., 2000a). It is also reported that PLZF is both acetylated and phosphorylated (Ball et al., 1999, Guidez et al., 2005). In this study, PLZF was found to be phosphorylated at serine and tyrosine residues in response to IFN, and we identified a serine residue (Ser76) that resides in the BTB domain of PLZF and that was important for PLZF-mediated ISG induction, thereby implicating a serine kinase in PLZF activation. Accordingly, kinase inhibitor studies implicate the serine kinase JNK as a potential activator of PLZF.",

Only promoters containing both regulatory elements show both PLZF- and IFN-dependent expression. Experiments in STAT1-deficient cells demonstrate that this factor is required for PLZF-dependent transcriptional induction, as expected in IFN signaling. A direct comparison of PLZF-independent and -dependent genes demonstrated that tissue-specific expression patterns of the closely related ISGs IFIT1 and IFIT2 may be determined by PLZF. We demonstrated that PLZF associates with other essential cofactors, PML and HDAC1. Consequently, we propose a model whereby PLZF functions to stabilize a transcription complex that minimally includes STATs, HDAC1, and PML to mediate the expression of specific ISGs.",

            "text": "Although only a subset of ISGs is regulated by PLZF, the observed impairment is physiologically critical because it is sufficient to severely compromise the antiviral immune response. We showed this immune impairment was due to direct defects in key IFN-mediated antiviral factors and to indirect mechanisms that modulate NK cell activity. The reduced viral load in the presence of PLZF and IFN suggests that IFN-improved survival after SFV infection requires PLZF. This correlates with regulation of the expression of the antiviral mediator OAS1. OAS1 combined with the ribonuclease L (RNaseL) constitutes an antiviral RNA decay pathway previously demonstrated to regulate SFV infection (Silverman, 2007). Impaired induction of other ISGs such as IFIT2 and RSAD2, which have recently been shown to function as antiviral effectors, was also found (Borden et al., 2007). Other ISGs identified as having impaired induction in Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 cells, most pertinently CXCL10, do not have a direct antiviral function. CXCL10 has been demonstrated, with other chemokines, to regulate NK cell function (Biron et al., 1999). A recent study comparing wild-type and Cxcl10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice has shown that CXCL10 expression promotes protection from coronavirus-induced neurological and liver disease (Walsh et al., 2007). Furthermore, a study using Cxcl9\n\u2212/\u2212 and Cxcl10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice has found that these chemokines are critical for the control of Herpes Simplex Virus infection through mobilization of NK cells and CTL to sites of infection (Thapa et al., 2008). IFN has an established role in the function of NK cells and influences NK activation during viral infection. Defects in NK cell activity, such as decreased production of IFN, also render mice more susceptible to viral infection (Lee et al., 2007). However, impaired NK cell function in Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice is independent of IFN production. Instead, we propose that the observed defect in NK cell activity in the Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mouse is due to impairment of specific ISGs, with CXCL10 identified as a likely candidate. Zbtb16\n\u2212/\u2212 mice show a marked decrease in CXCL10 expression in NK cell-rich organs, and such a decrease may lead to impaired mobility of NK cells, and therefore ineffective viral clearance. IFN-induced activation of NK cells resulted in potent cytotoxicity associated with a dramatic increase in GzmB. GzmB expression is essential for eliciting NK cell cytotoxic function and is responsible for the rapid induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated GzmB is an ISG (Cao et al., 2007, Zimmerer et al., 2007). However, the regulation of GzmB expression is not understood. Intriguingly, the GzmB promoter contains a binding site for PLZF, raising the possibility that PLZF directly regulates GzmB transcription. The findings here suggest that IFN-mediated activation of NK cells is regulated by PLZF.",
