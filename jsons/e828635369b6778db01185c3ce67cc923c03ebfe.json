CoV spike (S) protein which is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion via conformational changes, internalization of the virus, host tissue tropism and comprises crucial targets for vaccine development, remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 and validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8% of difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV. Addition of a novel glycosylation sites were observed in 2019-nCoV. In addition, antigenic analysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins. In spite of the variation in S protein amino acid composition, we found no significant difference in their structures. Collectively, for the first time our results exhibit the emergence of human 2019-nCoV is closely related to predecessor SARS-CoV and provide the evidence that 2019-nCoV uses various novel glycosylation sites as SARS-CoV and may have a potential to become pandemic owing its antigenic discrepancy. Further, demonstration of novel Cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes may impart opportunities for the development of peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-nCoV.",

The genome encodes four major structural proteins including spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) which required to make complete virus particle [3] . Upon entry into host cells, the viral genome translates into two large precursor polyproteins namely as pp1a and pp1ab which get processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp16) by ORF 1a-encoded viral proteinases, 3C-like proteinases (3CLpro) and papain-like proteinase (PLpro). These nonstructural proteins (nsps) perform crucial function during viral RNA replication and transcription [4] . RNA recombination without proof-reading mechanism among the existing coronaviruses is mostly responsible for the evolution and emergence of novel coronaviruses [5] . The frequency of recombination has been proposed to be higher in the S gene which codes for viral spike (S) glycoprotein. On 21st January 2020, Chinese authorities have confirmed around 200 human cases and three deaths due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan City, China. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 11th February 2020, a total of 43,103 cases have been confirmed with 1018 deaths with case fatality rate of 2.36%. Around 42,708 cases and 1017 deaths were reported from China alone. In addition to China, other South-East Asian countries including Singapore, Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Philippines, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia have reported cases of 2019-nCoV. Moreover, countries like United Arab Emirates, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Russia, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, USA, Canada and Australia have also reported with 2019-nCoV cases [6] . However, the route of transmission of 2019-nCoV has not been yet identified. The average age of the patients reported with 2019-nCoV infection is 56 years where more than 50% of the cases are from men. Health care professionals and hospitalized patients are at the highest risk for the 2019-nCoV transmission. Patients were mainly reported with pneumonia like symptoms as fever, fatigue, dry cough, lymphopenia, elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase and prolonged prothrombin time. In addition, patients had difficulty in breathing where chest radiographs showing bilateral patchy shadows, or ground glass opacity in all patients including invasive pneumonic infiltrates in few cases [7, 8] .",

All the samples have been found to be closely related to bat SARS-like Betacoronavirus [9] .

The internalization of virus also depends upon the potential glycosylation sites present on viral glycoprotein. Viral envelope comprises of three proteins where spike (S) and membrane (M) are the two major glycoproteins and envelope (E) is the non-glycosylated protein. The M protein comprises of short N-terminal glycosylated ectodomain with three transmembrane domains (TM) and a long C-terminal CT domain [12] . The M and E proteins are required for virus morphogenesis, assembly and budding. S glycoprotein is a type 1 fusion viral protein that comprises of two heptad repeat regions known as HR-C and HR-N which forms the coiled-coil structures surrounded by protein ectodomain [13] . S protein cleaved into two subunits S1 and S2 where S1 comprises of minimal receptor-binding domain (270-510) that helps in receptor binding and S2 facilitates membrane fusion [14] . S protein is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion, internalization of the virus, tissue tropism and host range and therefore is the crucial targets for vaccine development [15] . Therefore, in the present study we analyzed the S glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV considering its importance for virus attachment to the host cell receptor and compared it with its predecessor reference SARS-CoV strain for sequence variation, glycosylation pattern, structural and antigenic divergence for a better understanding of viral pathogenesis and antigenicity. , where as Japanese encephalitis virus (AF075723.1) was considered as an outlier.

Likewise, the WIV16 bat strains generated likely from the two other prevalent bat SARS-CoV strains [27] . The most frequent breakpoint for recombination exist in the S gene of coronavirus that encodes for spike (S) protein which comprises of minimalbinding domain and orf8 upstream that encodes an accessory protein [28] .

Foremost our data provide the evidence that 2019-nCoV uses various novel glycosylation sites as SARS-CoV and may have a potential to become pandemic owing its antigenic discrepancy. Further, demonstration of novel CTL epitopes may impart opportunities for the development of peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-nCoV. Additionally our revelation of similar antigenic sites in both 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus, suggests the scope of SARS-associated peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-nCoV. The similarity in the spike glycoprotein structures suggests the use of coronavirus specific attachment inhibitors as the current choice of therapy for 2019-nCoV.",
