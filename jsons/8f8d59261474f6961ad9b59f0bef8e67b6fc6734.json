The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV2 to be a pandemic in mid-March 2020.

On March 16th, the head of the WHO pronounced in favor of massive population tests, because \"you cannot fight a fire blindfolded\". 2 Yet, there is a growing debate about the impact of mass testing on mortality rates. 3 We have observed strong differences in testing rates between countries; for example, South-Korea, Germany, or Iceland, have undertaken important screening policies and now report low casefatality rates. On the contrary, countries like Spain or France have restricted access to diagnostic tests for inpatients or health care workers and now report higher mortality rates. 4 Unfortunately, cross-country comparisons are difficult due to the strong heterogeneity among countries. Even in the United States of America, endowments for medical centers and lockdown strategies are very different from one state to another. By contrast, France kept a relatively centralized health system but as the epidemic was expanding, the Health Regional Agencies (ARS) were given autonomy in terms of screening strategies implementation; however, at the same time, a strict lockdown approach was instituted for all regions. 5, 6 Among French regions, the main difference in their strategies was the intensity of testing policies. Screening policies and mortality rate might be related to the fact that testing allows authorities to detect and isolate infected people and to prevent them from transmitting the virus; and also enables early treatment, thus increasing the chances of cure. 7 We propose a novel approach to assess the impact of focused screening strategies on mortality rates, which exploits policy discontinuities at region borders and contiguous department pairs that are located on opposite sides of a region border. This methodology has been used in an economic setting to evaluate the effects of the minimum wage on earnings and employment in the US. 8",

From this date, testing policies were determined at the region level by the Regional Public Health Agencies. We used a fixed-effects model to assess the impact of the number of tests performed over time at a local geographical level (department) on fatality-cases. In fixed-effects models, subjects serve as their own controls, providing a means for controlling omitted-variable bias. Otherwise stated, fixed-effects models allow controlling for time-invariant heterogeneity, i.e. all possible characteristics that do not change over time. 9 We used two distinct samples: i) The all-department sample (AD sample) that includes 94 departments distributed across 12 regions; ii) The contiguous border department-pair sample (CBDP sample) that contains all the contiguous department pairs that straddle a region boundary. Metropolitan France counts 96 departments. We excluded two departments, Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud, that are part of a region, Corsica, that does not share any direct border with others. Among the 94 departments, 69 lie along a region border. As each department may belong to several department-pairs, we have a total of 237 distinct department-pairs. Our strategy consisted in comparing all contiguous department pairs sharing a region border (See Figure 1 for an example) to identify the effect of testing on the case fatality rate. Tests rate and death rates were calculated using the number of RT-PCR tests and the number of deaths related to COVID-19 divided by the number of patients admitted to the hospital, respectively.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, no large randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been implemented to investigate the effect of tests on the case-fatality rate, probably due to time, budget, or ethical constraints. When RCT are difficult to implement or unethical, natural experiments (NE) are one of the best alternatives. The principle of NE is to mimic the existence of treatment and control groups using an instrumental variable that induces a change in the explanatory variable but has any direct effect on the outcome. However, in the case of the COVID-19 epidemics, finding a suitable instrument remains a hard task. In the absence of RCT or NE, many researchers try to approximate using standard methods such as linear regression, logistic regression, or propensity scores. However, such methods are subject to the well-known omitted-variable bias, leading to severe bias in estimating the effects of the variables that are included. Consequently, causal inference via statistical adjustment represents a poor alternative to randomized experiments. In such a context, panel data models represent the best way to control for heterogeneity and to improve causal estimation. 8 We use a fixed-effects model because it represents a powerful tool for longitudinal data analysis. 9 However, such a model requires substantial differences between treatment intensities across entities and time to get precise estimates. Our data meets these conditions: i) no region has the same test rate path than other regions over the period considered; ii) the test rate varies greatly across regions and time. Methods based on regional controls and policy discontinuities have several advantages: i) contiguous border departments are relatively similar, in particular with regard to health trends, which are of major importance in the context of an epidemic; ii) the testing policy is determined at the region level and is largely exogenous from the point of view of a department, which rules out potential reverse causality. 8 Until a vaccine is developed, the only way to prevent an unrestrained scenario is to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This is a challenging task because some asymptomatic infected patients could potentially spread the virus. Literature reports an alarming proportion of asymptomatic infected cases. Epidemiological data from the Diamond Princess cruise sheep revealed only 18% of positive cases reported no symptoms. 10 Two hospitals in New York implemented universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs in women who were admitted for delivery, and revealed that nearly 90% of patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at admission reported no symptoms. 11 Overall population screening in Iceland revealed that only 57% of participants with positive tests reported symptoms of Covid-19. 12 This proportion could be even higher, because of false negative results of tests to detect SARS-CoV-2. 13 Testing is part of a strategy to limit the transmission of the virus and WHO recommends a rapid diagnosis and isolation of cases in combination with a rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts. Several authors support the implementation of mass screening policies. 3, 14 In our opinion, mass screening may positively impact the fatality case rate in different ways. First, unfocused testing, i.e. not limited to symptomatic subjects, could improve the monitoring of the progress of the epidemic and facilitate decision-making by the health authorities. The use of \"case definition\", given the limited knowledge of the new disease, probably resulted in a low sensitivity to detect infected subjects, resulting in a delayed perception of the progression of the epidemic. 15, 16 Screening strategies are subject to the availability of tests which indirectly shapes epidemic curves. 17 While the USA increased their screening capacities between late-February to early-March, the country experienced a rapid increase of total infected cases. 18 Second, mass screening may also allow early identification of infected subjects and rapid implementation of isolation measures. Early reports from Wuhan suggest that public health interventions combining universal symptoms survey, traffic restriction and home quarantine resulted were temporarily associated with an increased control of the outbreak. 19, 20 A modeling from Singapore suggests that quarantining of infected individuals and their family members, school closure and workplace distancing could reduce the progression of the epidemic but is associated to a significant economic cost. 21 Review from the Cochrane database concludes that quarantine is important in reducing the number of covid-19 cases but is dependent on screening strategies. 22 Also, a US survey on the impact of school closure on mortality reports that the transmission prevention by school closure needs to be weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers. 23 This supports that public health decisions should be as focused as possible in order to limit the negative impact on the economy and the society. 24 Importance of rapid diagnosis and case identification and isolation will become of utmost importance with the end of lockdowns.",
