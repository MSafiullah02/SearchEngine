            "text": "\nOne of the first applications of risk assessment was by NASA in the aftermath of the 1967 Apollo fire. Risk assessment is now widely used in different scientific disciplines including nuclear science, finance, industrial processing and infectious diseases. Charles Haas used risk assessment in the latter field for the first time to mathematically describe a dose\u2013response relationship for adverse public health events due to virus ingestion (Haas, 1983). The methodology was subsequently extended, with an exposure assessment to estimate the exposure dose and a risk quantification for the presence of viruses in drinking water (Haas et al., 1993). Despite this initial focus on viruses, quantitative microbiological risk assessments for food and water have so far focused predominantly on bacteria. Recently completed assessments include models that describe the entire food production pathway from production of the raw material until the moment of consumption (often described as \u2018farm-to-fork\u2019 models). Examples of this include the assessment of public health risks associated with E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef hamburgers (Cassin et al., 1998) with Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods (Rocourt et al., 2003) and with Campylobacter on broiler meat (Nauta et al., 2009). Such farm-to-fork models are now being developed for viruses in food for the first time as part of the European project \u2018Integrated monitoring and control of foodborne viruses in European food supply chains\u2019 (\u2018VITAL\u2019).",

These frameworks use the following steps for the assessment of food- and waterborne viruses:\u2022Identification of the pathogenic virus(es) that may be present in a particular type of food or water sample and that are capable of causing infection, illness or death in humans. In addition, the identification of the exposure route or routes; ingestion or inhalation, for example.\u2022Estimation of the virus dose to which individuals are exposed per exposure route.\u2022Quantitative evaluation of the nature and probability of adverse health effects associated with a certain intake of the pathogenic agent.\u2022Integration of the estimated exposure dose and the probability of the adverse health event, given that dose.

These include risk profiles of the Norwalk-like virus in raw molluscs in New Zealand (Greening et al., 2003), foodborne norovirus infections (HPA, 2004) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) (Bouwknegt et al., 2009). Factors such as the persistence of virus infectivity on foods, the role of irrigation water and food handlers\u2019 hands in virus transmission and the effectiveness of existing virus control points in food harvesting, processing and handling have had limited representation in the available data. It was therefore concluded at an international meeting of experts in 2007 that undertaking a full quantitative risk assessment for foodborne virus may be premature (FAO/WHO, 2008a). However, increased interest in food- and waterborne viruses and the development of accessible and rapid diagnostic methods in recent years has increased the amount of available data related to viruses in foods and water, with the result that quantitative models could now start to be designed.",

These studies demonstrate the importance of understanding (1) the theoretical backgrounds of the distributions used; (2) the randomness or lack thereof in processes leading to viral contamination; (3) the essence of the dose\u2013response models used (the measured response, the unit of the exposure dose); and (4) that uncertainty and variability are essential to the proper conduct of quantitative viral risk assessments.",

Petterson et al. (2001) modelled the clinging of viruses to lettuce crops through sprayed irrigation water. The volume of retained water was taken from a study in which lettuce heads were immersed fully in water (Shuval et al., 1997). The estimated volume amounted to approximately 10 ml per 100 g of lettuce, an estimate which was also later used in relation to lettuce by Hamilton et al. (2006). In the absence of better data, this volume was considered to represent a worst-case situation and provided an acceptable starting point for risk assessment. However, full immersion of crops might not accurately represent a worst-case scenario, as the volume of water on shrubs is reported to be larger after a simulated rainfall event than after immersion (Garcia-Estringana et al., 2010). Ideally the volume of water retained after single and multiple irrigation events should therefore be examined experimentally. Such an experiment was conducted by Hamilton et al. (2006) for broccoli, grand slam cabbage, savoy cabbage and winter head cabbage. Their results gave estimated mean water retentions of 0.02, 0.04, 0.04 and 0.09 ml per g of produce, respectively, after a single irrigation event of 20 min. Probability distributions that may be used in a quantitative risk assessment are provided in the paper.",

An important aspect to consider in the translation of an exposure dose to an adverse health event is the dose\u2013response model used, and how this relates to the subsequent modelled response. Depending on the data set underlying the dose\u2013response model, the initial translation from dose to risk represents the risk of the specific response used in that particular dose\u2013response model. For instance, the model to estimate norovirus infection risks was based on volunteers showing faecal excretion of virus and seroconversion (Teunis et al., 2008). In the same study, the dose\u2013response model for illness conditional on infection was based on a response including diarrhoea and/or vomiting combined with other symptoms such as abdominal pain, myalgia, fatigue, chills and headache more than 8 h after the infection. Thus, employing either the first or both models estimates the respective response observed in the volunteers.",

Due to the lack of more appropriate data, such estimates are often extrapolated to other (sub)populations or to the general population in order to proclaim a risk of adverse health events.

An additional measure used to represent adverse health effects for humans is an estimate of the disability adjusted life years (DALY) (Murray, 1994). This measure is a combination of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the period of time spent in a suboptimal health status as a consequence of infection. A DALY estimate therefore includes the translation from infection to actual disease. Such an estimate may give greater insight into the adverse health effects of pathogens in the environment than an infection risk, as infection does not necessarily produce illness. The WHO use DALY to measure the global burden of disease (Lopez et al., 2006), and also base their targets for public health protection on DALYs rather than on infection or illness risks. However, the progression from infection to disease can be highly variable between individual humans and depends on multiple host and pathogen characteristics.

However, robust estimates are not possible given the limited data available. Details of virus transfer between food products, hands and utensils are therefore largely unquantified and uncertain. Viral transfer from carriers (humans, animals) or environmental sources to foods, as well as between foods, are largely based on assumptions rather than on experimental or field data. It is deemed important to perform virus transfer experiments under controlled settings following specified protocols. It was shown that 1% (0.2\u201310%), 0.05% (0.02\u20130.3%) and 9% (4\u201315%) of infectious MNV-1 was transferred from fingertips to raspberries, strawberries and lettuce, respectively (Verhaelen et al., in preparation). The transfer fractions of MNV-1 from raspberries and lettuce to fingertips was 3% (< 0.01\u20135%) and 4% (2\u20136%), respectively. Using the estimated mean transfer rate of MNV-1, it was estimated that a single food handler with an initial virus contamination level of 104 infectious virus particles on his fingertips could contaminate more than 2 kg of raspberries with a minimum of one virus particle per raspberry. This study exemplifies the substantial role a single food handler can have in the transmission of hNoV, considering hNoV is the most infectious agent described, with an infection probability of about 0.5 per single hNoV particle (Teunis et al., 2008).",

Furthermore, the food matrix itself can induce virus inactivation due to, for example, the effects of pH or the presence of proteases. For most intact fresh produce, no recommended storage temperature is provided by legislation. In general, low temperatures and high relative humidity are applied in the fresh produce industry to prolong shelf-life and maintain produce quality. Unlike for bacteria, these conditions generally promote viral persistence. The usual storage temperature of lettuce, for example, is about 4 \u00b0C with a relative humidity (RH) of about 80%. The shelf-life of lettuce is strongly dependent on storage conditions: a shelf-life of 21\u201328 days can be expected at 0 \u00b0C with > 95% RH, whilst at 5 \u00b0C a shelf-life of 14 days can be expected. At point of sale, whole lettuces are usually stored at ambient temperature. Persistence of feline calicivirus (FCV) on lettuce in commonly applied storage conditions was studied by Mattison et al. (2007). After 4 days of storage at 21 \u00b0C the virus was not detectable, which is equivalent to a reduction of about 2.5 log10-units. Infectious FCV was reduced by about 2 log10-units after seven days of storage at 4 \u00b0C. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) was found to be persistent on raspberries and strawberries at 4 and 10 \u00b0C, meaning that the D-values (first 1 log10 unit reduction) reached or exceeded the 7-day shelf-life of the berries. However, MNV-1 infectivity dropped by about 1.5 log10-units on strawberries after just one day of storage at room temperature, whereas no virus decay was observed on raspberries in this period. A 1 log; 0 unit decrease in MNV-1 infectivity only occurred on raspberries after 3 days at room temperature, yet in practice, raspberries are rarely stored over such a long period.

The effectiveness of treatment processes for virus reduction has mostly been assessed by use of indicator viruses such as MNV (murine norovirus), FCV and phages. In order to conduct a quantitative viral risk assessment, it is important to first know which decontamination practices are used in food production, whilst acknowledging that lab experiments may produce different outcomes to standard virus reduction due to current practices in the field. Secondly, process-specific infectivity rates for each virus, or an appropriate surrogate thereof, should ideally be included in the study. Unfortunately, the lack of cell culture systems for certain viruses, including NoV and HEV, have hampered such studies in the past. Alternative approaches, such as the use of animal models (Feagins et al., 2008) or cell infection experiments (Emerson et al., 2005) have been developed for HEV. The results of both experiments indicated that HEV was still viable when heated at 56 \u00b0C for an hour. In an in vivo animal experiment, one of the livers used as inoculum was stir-fried at 191 \u00b0C (internal temperature of 71 \u00b0C) for 5 min and infection was not observed after inoculation. Furthermore, recent progress in HEV culture has been made in the European project \u2018VITAL\u2019, by using a 3D cell culture system. Initial experiments with this system have shown that HEV is inactivated when heated at 100 \u00b0C for 15 s (Berto et al., 2012). Hence, HEV seems to be heat-intolerant above a certain temperature, but the temperature-dependent inactivation rate is yet to be determined.",

As indicated before, the availability of an efficient cell culture system might allow the inclusion of a correction factor in the dose\u2013response model, although this factor is expected to be highly variable.",

However, the details of this are at present largely unknown (Gerba et al., 1996). Exposure to foodborne viruses may result in more severe disease outcomes for vulnerable subpopulations, such as immunodeficient transplant recipients, those living with HIV/AIDS, children, the elderly and pregnant women. NoV infection, for example, is common in all age groups but the incidence is highest in young children (< 5 years). In the case of HAV, severe infections among adults are rare in high endemic areas, due to induced life-long immunity upon exposure as a child, whereas in low endemic areas the disease mainly occurs in adulthood with an increased likelihood of severe symptomatic illness developing. Hepatitis E (at least genotype 1) poses a particular threat to pregnant women, who are at high risk of developing severe hepatitis, resulting in mortality in up to 25% of cases for this category. Similarly, individuals with underlying diseases, such as chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis or a history of high alcohol consumption, are at a higher risk of developing hepatitis E, whilst immunosuppressed transplant patients are at risk of developing chronic hepatitis E.",

When cell culture systems are available, the number of cytopathologic effects in cell culture, or plaques in a plaque assay, can be interpreted as an indicator of the number of infectious viruses per unit of sample examined. At present, where such systems are not routinely available, as is the case for NoV, HAV and HEV, one is restricted to the use of indirect methods such as genome detection by (RT-) PCR. The methods for correct use of qPCR data in QMRA are lacking, which leads to the currently unavoidable ignorance of two aspects: (1) distinction between genomes originating from infectious (viable) and non-infectious (non-viable) micro-organisms; and (2) uncertainty and bias in quantification of genomes. Distinction between infectious and non-infectious micro-organisms cannot be made with qPCR directly, because the detected genomes can originate from both types of micro-organism. Approaches to distinguish between the two by using, for example, enzymatic pre-treatment are being explored at present (Schielke et al., 2011).",

A solution to this problem can be to share the raw laboratory data with risk analysts. Alternatively, the science community could strive to ensure raw data are included with their publications in journals, and/or submitted to global databases maintained by networks of scientists, such as the COST network for Food and Environmental Virologists or the Food and Water Department of the responsible Ministry, Inspectorate or research institute.
