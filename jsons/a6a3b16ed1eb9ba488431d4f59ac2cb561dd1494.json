Acute leukemia, for example, predisposes to neutropenia and other defects of innate immunity. Profound neutropenia (<500 cells/mm 3 ) of greater than 10-day duration is considered a strong risk factor for bacterial and invasive fungal infection [1] . In addition to neutropenia, other factors that increase risk for invasive aspergillosis include advanced or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia, high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic neutropenia prior to chemotherapy, iron overload secondary to repeated peripheral blood transfusions, and prior fungal infection [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Further, antileukemic agents have been shown to diminish antibody response to primary antigens, thereby increasing susceptibility to bacterial pathogens even in the absence of neutropenia [7] . Other underlying diseases such as primary immunodeficiency, for example, may predispose to progression or reactivation of antecedent infections, and individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome who are neutropenic at the time of transplant are at an increased risk of infection and mortality. In addition to innate immune defects, increasing age, waning cellular immunity, organ dysfunction, fragile skin, and prior antibiotic exposure may all contribute to the progression of preexisting infection, including aspergillosis, as well as to the risk for new infections during the posttransplant period [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

The goals of conditioning are twofold: (1) to suppress the recipient's immune system, particularly the T-cell arm, in order to prevent rejection of the graft, and (2) to eliminate the tumor. Many regimens are myeloablative, employing total body irradiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy, with resultant profound and prolonged neutropenia, mucositis, and potential organ toxicities. Recipients of such conditioning are highly susceptible to early infection and sepsis. Less intense regimens increasingly used in some of the more vulnerable older patients may result in minimal neutropenia and mucositis and a correspondingly lower risk of infection [12] . However, recipients of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens may experience prolonged neutropenia should engraftment fail.",

            "text": "GVHD occurs when donor T-cells attack the recipient's tissues as a consequence of either T-cell ablation of the graft prior to transplant or by the administration of immunosuppressive drugs after transplantation. When unmanipulated bone marrow or peripheral stem cells are used, 24-300 \u00d7 10 6 / kg CD3 cells are administered. Ex vivo pretreatment of the graft may produce up to a 3-log reduction in cells transplanted and decrease the potential risk and severity of GVHD. However, there is a resultant prolonged T-cell immunodeficiency, and the patient must then walk an immunological-infection tightrope for many months. If an untreated graft is transplanted, then any one of a variety of immunosuppressive regimens may be given. Examples are sirolimus and a calcineurin inhibitor, such as tacrolimus. It appears that these regimens pose a lower infection risk than pretransplant T-cell ablation [16] . Sirolimus therapy has also been associated with a reduced risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [17, 18] . GVHD is classified as acute when the onset is prior to posttransplant day 100 and chronic when the onset is after day 100. Acute disease may persist into the chronic period, in which case it is termed progressive. While GVHD may respond to treatment and go into remission, it may also reactivate at a later date. Acute disease, characterized by secretory diarrhea, hepatitis, and skin rash, is categorized according to severity with grades 3 and 4 posing an increased risk of mortality. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy. The intense immunosuppression associated with the condition itself and enhanced by its treatment, combined with disrupted barrier defenses, especially in the intestine, place patients at great risk of infection. CMV infection is common as are other viral, bacterial, and fungal infections such as aspergillosis [19] .",

Infecting organisms are commonly Gram-positive cocci such as Streptococcus viridans and enterococci or a variety of fermenting and nonfermenting Gram-negative rods. Enterococci are increasingly resistant to vancomycin, and these strains have been associated with a worse prognosis than vancomycin-sensitive strains [39] . Some recent studies also report an increase in infections due to multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenemaseproducing Klebsiella pneumoniae [40] [41] [42] [43] . The isolation of such resistant bacteria has been associated with the use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and third-generation cephalosporins in several reports.

Many patients have B-cell dysfunction and are functionally asplenic [58, 59] . They are thus vulnerable to serious infections with encapsulated bacteria, most notably Streptococcus pneumoniae, with pneumonia as the usual source [36, 60, 61] . Some patients are hypogammaglobulinemic, further increasing their risk. Less common are infections due to mycobacteria and Nocardia. Case reports suggest a global incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in allo-HSCT recipients ranging from 0.4% to 4.9% [37, [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . Tuberculosis in this patient population, however, ranges from 0.0014% to 3% in the United States to as high as 8.5% in Taiwan [67] [68] [69] [70] . Systemic nocardiosis is rare, and one center reported a cumulative incidence of 1.75%; cases were all observed in patients with extensive chronic GVHD [71] . Preventive strategies include vaccination with the heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine at 3-6 months post-engraftment for all patients [51] . Immunogenicity of this vaccine, however, appears to be related to immune reconstitution, particularly in allo-HSCT recipients aged 50 and over. In this population, improved vaccine response has been associated with CD4 >200 cells/\u03bcL, IgG >500 mg/dL, and phytohemagglutinin within 60% of the lower limit of normal [72] . Patients with active GVHD should also receive antibiotic prophylaxis aimed at pneumococcus. Penicillin V usually suffices, but trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or dox-ycycline may also be considered depending on local resistance patterns. For patients who are severely hypogammaglobulinemic (<400 mg IgG), regular infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be considered. Meticulous care of central venous catheters is mandatory [51, 73] .",

Risk factors include GVHD, lymphopenia, and the presence of children younger than 12 years of age at home. Diagnosis involves clinical suspicion and RT-PCR. Mortality is variable and is usually associated with complications such as respiratory failure and bacterial or fungal superinfection. Preventative measures include vaccination, hand washing, and isolation measures in the setting of outbreaks. Besides anti-influenza drugs, antiviral therapy for most other respiratory viruses remains largely unproven [119, 120] .",

Individuals undergoing allo-HSCT are at higher risk for developing IFIs compared to recipients of autologous grafts, largely owing to delayed engraftment and GVHD. The epidemiology of IFIs in HSCT recipients remains dynamic. Since the 1990s, there has been a decrease in the incidence of invasive candidiasis among HSCT recipients due to the more widespread use of fluconazole prophylaxis; however, IFIs due to Aspergillus and other filamentous molds remain a significant concern. Candida Candida species commonly inhabit the skin and mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, and disruption of the integrity of either mucosal barrier can lead to invasive candidiasis. In the setting of allo-HSCT, invasive candidiasis typically results from mucositis of the gastrointestinal tract incurred during conditioning. Additional risk factors for invasive candidiasis include HLA mismatch, recipient age, prolonged neutropenia, GVHD, gastrointestinal tract colonization, and CMV disease [133, 134] .",

This prompted the widespread use of fluconazole prophylaxis in the early posttransplant period. More recent data from the Prospective Antifungal Therapy (PATH) Alliance registry, however, reported a 28% and 23% incidence of invasive candidiasis in allo-HSCT recipients from matched-related and matched-unrelated donors, respectively [138] . While Candida albicans accounted for over half of all episodes of invasive candidiasis in HSCT recipients in the 1980s, invasive candidiasis caused by azoleresistant Candida species such as C. glabrata and C. krusei has increased since the 1990s, which may reflect the routine use of fluconazole prophylaxis [28-30, 137, 138] .",

In contrast, hepatosplenic candidiasis, or chronic disseminated candidiasis, results from invasion of Candida species into the portal vasculature with subsequent seeding of the liver and/or spleen during periods of neutropenia. While the exact incidence of hepatosplenic candidiasis remains unknown, one autopsy study identified hepatic candidal infection in 9% of HSCT recipients [140] . Patients typically present with fever and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level following neutrophil recovery. Blood cultures tend to be negative in this setting, but computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrates multiple lesions in the liver and spleen; such lesions decrease in size with recurrent neutropenia, indicating that hepatosplenic candidiasis results from a systemic inflammatory response.

Several studies have demonstrated comparable efficacy between both antifungal classes; however, echinocandins have been associated with a more favorable toxicity profile [143, 144] . Voriconazole may be used in situations where additional mold coverage is desired; however, since voriconazole resistance has been seen in 3% of Candida infections in solid organ and HSCT recipients, this agent should not be used unless susceptibility of the isolate is confirmed [145, 146] . As the majority of cases of hepatosplenic candidiasis are caused by C. albicans, clinically stable patients may receive fluconazole. Those who are acutely ill or who have relapsed disease should receive 1-2 weeks of induction with liposomal amphotericin B or an echinocandin followed by fluconazole. Duration of therapy for hepatosplenic candidiasis is dependent upon resolution of visceral lesions, typically 3-6 months.

            "text": "The onset of invasive aspergillosis following HSCT occurs in a bimodal fashion, with the first peak noted within the first 40 days of transplantation [149] and corresponding to the period of neutropenia. The second peak occurs post-engraftment (\"late period\"), typically defined as 41+ days following transplant, and tends to arise in the setting of acute or chronic GVHD [147, 148, 150] . Age >40 has been associated with the development of invasive aspergillosis at any time following transplantation, as have donor and recipient polymorphisms in various Toll-like receptors and genes regulating interleukin-1, interleukin-10 promoter, and plasminogen [147, [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] . Specifically, donor haplotype 1363T/1063G, which contains two cosegregated single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Toll-like receptor 4 gene, has been associated with the development of invasive aspergillosis [151] . Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL-10) gene have also been demonstrated to reduce dendritic cell CXCL-10 expression when exposed to Aspergillus germlings; these polymorphisms have also been associated with invasive aspergillosis following allo-HSCT [154] . Hematologic malignancies other than chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase, as well as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, mismatched donor, the use of cord blood, summer season, lack of laminar air flow, and local building construction, have been identified as risk factors for invasive aspergillosis in the early posttransplant period. The risk of invasive aspergillosis in the late posttransplant period increases in the setting of underlying multiple myeloma, use of T-celldepleted or CD34-selected stem cell products, neutropenia, lymphopenia, use of corticosteroids, CMV disease, respiratory virus infection, and GVHD [147, 148] . GVHD and CMV disease are the major risk factors for the development of invasive aspergillosis >6 months after transplantation [148] . The contribution of GVHD to the risk of invasive aspergillosis is highlighted by the fact that conditioning regimens do not appear to impact the incidence of this invasive fungal infection. While the period of neutropenia is shorter and the incidence of early invasive aspergillosis is less in non-myeloablative HSCT recipients, this group remains at highest risk in the late posttransplant period in conjunction with GVHD [12, [156] [157] [158] .",

The lungs represent the most commonly involved site of infection, though patients may develop sinusitis, CNS disease, and tracheobronchitis. Clinical presentation may be variable, but frequently includes fever, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, and/or respiratory failure, and the presence of these symptoms should prompt CT of the chest. Lung lesions, with surrounding ground-glass halos, nodular infiltrates, and cavitations, are highly suggestive of pulmonary aspergillosis; however, radiographic findings can be variable in allo-HSCT recipients with concomitant GVHD and include focal infiltrates and/or bronchopneumonia [160] . Given the lack of specificity of symptoms and radiographic findings, prompt microbiologic diagnosis via bronchoscopy should be pursued. Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis may also be facilitated with use of the Aspergillus galactomannan assay, which employs a doublesandwich enzyme immunoassay to detect the galactomannan component of the Aspergillus cell wall. While the sensitivity of the serum galactomannan assay has varied between studies, it has proven clinically useful for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and monitoring of clinical response during therapy [161, 162] . The galactomannan assay on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with hematologic malignancies and HSCT recipients has demonstrated higher sensitivity than bronchoalveolar lavage culture, cytology, and the serum galactomannan assay [163] . Important caveats for the use of galactomannan testing include false negative results in individuals receiving concomitant antifungals, false positive results in children and patients receiving beta-lactams, particularly piperacillin-tazobactam, and cross-reactivity with plasmalyte [164] [165] [166] . The beta-D-glucan test, which detects beta-glucans in the cell wall of molds and yeasts except zygomycetes and cryptococci, may also be a valuable adjunctive screening test for invasive aspergillosis particularly in conjunction with the galactomannan assay, though the performance characteristics of the beta-D-glucan assay in the HSCT population have not yet been evaluated.",

As with invasive aspergillosis, the onset of fusariosis occurs in a bimodal fashion; infection in the early posttransplant period is associated with prolonged neutropenia, and late infection is associated with T-cell depletion, corticosteroid use, and GVHD. Infection with Fusarium species can mimic invasive aspergillosis; however, patients with fusariosis are more likely to have positive blood cultures and multiple papular or ulcerated skin lesions compared to patients with invasive aspergillosis [176, 178] .",

In regions of the world with a higher seroprevalence, incidence rates of toxoplasmosis are predictably higher [187] . Disease usually occurs in the first 6 months after transplantation [185, 186] . Besides seropositivity, the main risk factor for reactivation is intensification of immunosuppression due to GVHD [186] . The most common clinical presentation is encephalitis, which usually presents with focal neurological deficits. Extra-CNS forms of toxoplasmosis include pneumonitis, chorioretinitis, and myocarditis. Diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in any of the above manifestations requires a high clinical suspicion. A toxoplasma PCR can be obtained in serum and tissue such as CSF and vitreous fluid [188, 189] . First-line treatment includes extensive treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Despite best efforts mortality in allo-HSCT recipients remains high [185, 190] .
