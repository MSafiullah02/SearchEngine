            "text": "IgA deficiency is the most common primary immune deficiency disease of humans, affecting as many as 1:400 individuals (Hanson, 1983; Hammarstrom et al., 2000). Although most IgA-deficient individuals are healthy, the absence of IgA is associated with the development of certain diseases, including allergy, recurrent infections, and autoimmune disease (Schaffer et al., 1991; Cunningham-Rundles, 2003; Hammarstrom et al., 2000).). The genetic elements controlling IgA secretion have not been identified. In most cases the inheritance appears to be sporadic, but IgA deficiency may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive fashion. Immunoglobulin abnormalities can be found in other family members, the most common defect being common variable immunodeficiency. Several studies have noted a higher frequency of mother-to-child inheritance of IgA deficiency than of father-to-child inheritance (Koistinen, 1976; Oen et al., 1982; Vorechovsky et al., 2000). One explanation is the potential transplacental passage of anti-IgA antibodies, which could result in IgA deficiency in the infant. The offspring of 27 IgA-deficient mothers have been examined; 12 had IgA levels more than 1 standard deviation (SD) below normal, and 7 had levels more than 2 SDs below normal. Of the seven with the lowest IgA levels, five had mothers who had anti-IgA antibodies during gestation (Petty et al., 1985).",

In fact, the earliest report described IgA deficiency in two healthy young physicians (Rockey et al., 1964). The usual explanation is that the healthy IgA-deficient individuals have increased levels of secretory IgM in mucosal secretions that compensate for S-IgA (Brandtzaeg et al., 1987) or that IgA-deficient subjects who have the most illnesses may also be deficient in IgG2, a defect linked to the inheritance of Gm allotypes (Oxelius et al., 1995). Additional immunologic deficits have been identified in IgA deficiency that could increase susceptibility to infection; these include a relatively poor response to carbohydrate antigens, even if IgG2 subclass levels are normal (Hammarstrom et al., 1985), and a deficiency of IgG4 without IgG2 deficiency (French et al., 1995). Although all of these explanations have merit, the presence or level of IgM in secretions is not well correlated with health in IgA deficiency, and IgG subclass and antibody deficits are not usually found in those who have more illnesses.",

CD4+ T cells, in particular, regulate IgA production in the mouse and perhaps in humans, involving secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10. A number of studies point to transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 as a key cytokine in this process, prompting isotype switch and committing antigen-primed B cells to secrete IgA. With this in mind, investigators have tested B cells of IgA-deficient subjects under a number of conditions to assess the role of cytokines in IgA deficiency.",

TGF-\u03b2 has also been investigated; serum levels of TGF-\u03b2 in IgA-deficient sera were less than in the serum of normal donors, but the biologic meaning of this is unclear (Muller et al., 1995). Islam et al. (1994) found no difference in TGF-\u03b2 mRNA in IgA-deficient individuals compared with controls. In another study, mitogen-stimulated mononuclear cells of IgA-deficient patients with the common MHC haplotype HLA-B8, -DR3 had significantly reduced IL-5 production (Lio et al., 1995).",

First, transgenic IgA-/\u2013 knockout mice have been generated by targeting the entire IgA switch region and the 5\u2032 half of the constant region (Harriman et al., 1999; Mbawuike et al., 1999). A second, more indirect model emphasizes the role of TGF-\u03b21 in isotype switch and secretion of IgA; TGF-\u03b21 knockout has partial IgA deficiency (van Glinkel et al., 1999), and the TGF-\u03b21R knockout has impaired mucosal IgA responses (Cazac and Roes, 2000). Similarly, mice with a deletion of IL-5R \u03b1-chain (IL-5R \u03b1\u2212/\u2013) have lower levels of IgA in mucosal secretions than do wild-type mice, but the levels of IgA in serum are not reduced (Hiroi et al., 1999). IL-5 is important for the development of IgA B cells in the intestine (and perhaps elsewhere), and disruption of the IL-5 receptor reduces mucosal antibody responses. In a different model, the tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin \u03b1 (a double knockout, TNF/LT-\u03b1\u2212/\u2013) mouse has only low numbers of total IgA-producing cells, no Peyer's patches, and no mucosal IgA. Mice lacking exon 2 of the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) have very reduced S-IgA, but here, serum IgA levels are markedly increased (Shimada et al., 1999).",

S-IgA is generally directed to bacteria, viruses, and proteins normally restricted to the intestinal tract (\nTable 64.1\n). It also prevents attachment and agglutinate antigens to reduce absorption of these substances from mucosal surfaces by direct antibody-mediated exclusion. The general inability of IgA to fix complement suggests that S-IgA serves to clear antigens while provoking little in the way of inflammation. The S-IgA molecular complex contains large amounts of attached carbohydrates that can bind to pathogens (Schroten et al. 1998). For example, fucose, linked \u03b11-2 to galactose on the SC N-glycans, competes with Helicobacter pylori for binding to gastric receptors (Falk, et al., 1993; Boren et al., 1993). Free SC binds to Escherichia coli (Wold, et al., 1990; de Oliveira, et al., 2001), toxin A from Clostridium difficile (Dallas and Rolfe 1998), and both free and S-IgA-bound SC interacts specifically with a surface protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Hammerschmidt et al. 1997; Zhang et al., 2000). These lectin capacities constitute an important mechanism by which pathogens can be prevented from adherence to epithelium. S-IgA also bind to type 1\u2013fimbriated E. coli, which expresses a mannose-specific lectin (Wold et al., 1990). These bacterial binding sites on S-IgA allow IgA to participate in both innate and adaptive immunity (Royle et al., 2003).",

            "text": "With regard to the biologic actions of S-IgA, a number of studies have been done in the last few decades to determine what effect the lack of this immunoglobulin has on people who are IgA-deficient. In IgA deficiency there is a paucity of IgA-secreting plasma cells in the submucosa of all secretory tissues, little or no S-IgA in mucosal fluids, and the substitution of IgM-secreting plasma cells for IgA-secreting cells in the intestinal tract (Brandtzaeg et al., 1987). The substitution of IgM for the IgA isotype may have a biologic role, although the data for this hypothesis are relatively meager. The colostrum of IgA-deficient subjects contains abundant amounts of IgM (Barros et al., 1985), and the saliva of IgA-deficient individuals does contain biologically active IgM antibody, such as secretory IgM to Streptococcus mutans (Arnold et al., 1977). On the other hand, secretory IgM may not confer mucosal protection equivalent to that of S-IgA. IgA-deficient blood donors harbor poliovirus longer after oral vaccination than normal subjects do (Savilahti et al., 1988). Additionally, secretory IgM is subject to rapid degradation in the intestinal lumen (Richman and Brown, 1977). Whether IgM serves the same role as IgA is also challenged by another study; Mellander et al. (1986) attempted to relate the number of respiratory tract infections in IgA-deficient subjects to the level of IgM in saliva, hypothesizing that an inverse relationship was likely to be present. These studies showed that there was no such relationship. Norhagen and associates (1989) have also questioned the view that IgM can compensate for IgA deficiency, since they could not relate salivary IgM levels to health or frequency of illness in 63 IgA-deficient subjects. However, Fernandes et al. (1995) found that IgA-deficient children with increased levels of salivary anti-Streptococcus mutans of the IgM isotype had fewer dental caries, suggesting a protective role for this antibody. In addition, S-IgM antibodies may be intrinsically less biologically efficient, resulting, for example, in more prolonged excretion of vaccine viruses than seen in normal subjects (Savilahti et al., 1986).",

These lymphoid nodules may be focal but are usually multiple in antibody deficiency syndromes, are most commonly 5 mm or so in size, and are found predominantly in the lamina propria and submucosa of the small intestine but occasionally in the large intestine, rectum, or stomach These nodules can be associated with mucosal flattening and if large enough can cause obstruction or be on the leading edge of intussusception. The lesions may be so multiple and produce so much villous flattening that malabsorption develops. Immunofluorescence studies usually demonstrate a proliferation of IgM plasma cells. This is in contrast to the lymphoid nodules in the gastrointestinal tract in hypogammaglobulinemic patients; in the latter, plasma cells are often greatly reduced in number and tend to contain an expanded population of B lymphocytes.",

Intestinal biopsy specimens from patients with selective IgA deficiency and celiac disease are similar to those from nonimmunodeficient patients with celiac disease (with the exceptions noted below), and the response to a gluten-free diet in IgA-deficient celiac patients is similar to that of non-IgA-deficient subjects. However, serologic detection and monitoring of therapy are more difficult in subjects with IgA deficiency, as they will not have the hallmark antibodies, serum IgA against endomysium or reticulin, or tissue transglutaminase. Serum IgG tissue transglutaminase levels, however, are elevated in IgA-deficient patients with celiac disease and can be used as a disease marker (Korponay-Szabo et al., 2003). Whereas non-IgA-deficient celiac subjects may have increased mucosal synthesis of IgA and IgM rheumatoid factors, IgA-deficient subjects with celiac disease may produce only IgM rheumatoid factors, illustrating again the tendency for substitution of IgM for IgA in the IgA-deficient intestinal tract (Hallgren et al., 1996).",

In the absence of S-IgA, fimbriated E. coli isolates also appear to have decreased adherence to colonic epithelial cells, suggesting that IgA influences the level of fimbrial expression of intestinal bacteria. IgA-deficient subjects are also more likely to harbor E. coli with potentially inflammatory properties (Friman et al., 1996, 2002).

Of 25 IgA-deficient patients, circulating immune complexes were found in the serum of 24 patients after milk ingestion over a period of 2 hours; 15 of these subjects had enough milk antigen in the serum to be detected by a method as insensitive as agar diffusion. There did not appear to be any predictable relationship between the amount of immune complex formed and the amount of serum or salivary IgA. Some IgA-deficient subjects with no serum or salivary IgA had no circulating immune complexes following milk ingestion, whereas other individuals with readily detectable serum and salivary IgA had large amounts of immune complexes after drinking milk. Some subjects who had only modest deficits of serum IgA (levels of 30 to 60 mg/dL) had large amounts of bovine antigens detectable in their sera after drinking milk. These data showed that even individuals with a relatively leaky intestinal tract can have serum IgA levels that are only modestly reduced; some of these individuals would not normally be classified as immune-deficient. On the other hand, the level of immune complex in the circulation after drinking milk was closely related to the level of serum antibody to bovine milk proteins (P < 0.01) (Cunningham-Rundles, 1986).",

Some of these exogenous antigens could share antigenic cross-reactivity with endogenous antigens and perhaps serve as a stimulus to autoantibody formation. In addition to the large amount of antibody to dietary proteins discussed earlier, IgA-deficient serum also contains antibodies to a bovine mucoprotein constituent of the fat globule membrane formed by the bovine mammary gland in the process of milk formation (Butler and Oskvig, 1974), showing that unexpected bovine epithelial antigens can stimulate antibody production. Other dietary constituents could present additional unusual antigenic components to which an IgA-deficient subject could become sensitized.

Since at least some anti-idiotypic antibodies made by the IgA-deficient individual were found directed at the binding site of the primary antibody, it seems likely that casein antigen and the anti-idiotype could bind alternatively to the primary antibody, depending on the serum concentration of the antigen. After drinking milk, for example, a large amount of casein might be present, which would tend to displace the anti-idiotype from the anticasein antibody. After a period of fasting, the amount of casein antigen in the blood might be lower, and the immune complex present would be more likely to contain idiotype and anti-idiotype.",

In the same study, the median percentage of crypt cells in mitosis was higher in IgA deficiency than in controls, suggesting chronic antigen stimulation (Klemola et al., 1995). Giorgi et al. (1986) found that the small intestinal mucosa of children with IgA deficiency displayed unusual pathologic changes, some of which were detectable at only the ultrastructural level. These lesions included extensive alterations of the surface epithelium, areas of missing glycocalyx, and enterocytes with \u201cfrayed\u201d microvilli. Since these abnormalities were found in the absence of ongoing disease, the authors believed these changes to be characteristic of \u201cnormal\u201d IgA-deficient individuals. Gut permeability to lactulose, l-rhamnose, is increased, as demonstrated by abnormally large urinary excretion of these compounds, which shows that IgA-deficient subjects have excessive gastrointestinal tract absorption of these larger-molecular-weight substances (Pignata et al., 1990). Since these substances are immunologically inert, this tends to confirm the notion that structural gastrointestinal lesion(s) may be present in addition to the lack of IgA. The lesions described could permit the absorption of antigens from the intestinal lumen, even in the presence of local compensations (such as increased IgM) for S-IgA.",

Serum levels of IgG, IgA, and usually IgM are low, and there is little or no antibody production, which leads to recurrent infections, particularly of the sinopulmonary tracts (Cunningham-Rundles, 1999; Hermaszewski and Webster, 1993; Hammarstrom et al., 2000). Although it is generally suspected that CVI is a genetic disease, the cause(s) are unknown and indeed might vary among different subjects. Patients with CVID are more likely than controls to have inherited the MHC antigens HLA-B8 and -DR3; the same antigens are found in increased prevalence in IgA deficiency. For this reason and the fact that some families may have some members with CVID and others with IgA deficiency, these two diseases are considered genetically related abnormalities (Schaffer et al., 1989; Vorechovsky et al., 1995; Kralovicova et al., 2003).",

Bacterial overgrowth can occur in the setting of antibody deficiency and may result in nutrient deficiency due to competition by the bacteria. A trial of broad-spectrum antibiotics can be useful in determining whether bacterial overgrowth is the cause of the malabsorption. This may include impaired absorption of fat, d-xylose, minerals, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin A, D, and E), zinc, and vitamin B12. Zinc deficiency, which worsens T cell dysfunction, can itself be associated with diarrhea, which can further complicate the immunologic picture (Dardenne, 2002.) Intestinal biopsies may reveal changes similar to those seen in celiac sprue, but a more striking mononuclear infiltrate may develop, giving a nodular appearance to the mucosa. In these cases, edematous loops of small bowel may be found on computed tomography (\nFig. 64.3\n). Use of an elemental diet or total parenteral nutrition is sometimes required (Teahon et al., 1994). Corticosteroids may reduce the diarrheal fluid loss and can result in dramatic improvement (Ruan et al., 1996), but long-term use can lead to a highly significant risk of opportunistic infections. In a rare case, cholestyramine has been found of value (Sperber and Mayer, 1988).",

Four patients in an early report of 50 subjects developed carcinoma of the stomach (Hermans et al., 1976). In a study in Great Britain, 7 CVID patients in a group of 220 had gastric cancer (Kinlin, 1985). In the United States, gastric cancer was found in one person in a group of 98 CVID patients, although lymphoma was found in 11. Of these, one patient had an intestinal (jejunal) lymphoma (Cunningham-Rundles, 1999). Subjects with CVID may also be particularly susceptible to the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphomas (Cunningham-Rundles et al., 2002.) Recent work to estimate the incidence of cancer in Denmark and Sweden has been reported (Mellemkjaer et al., 2002).",

In the analysis of a series of such patients, large amounts of bovine casein and bovine \u03b3-globulin were found in the serum (Cunningham-Rundles et al., 1984). The amount of foreign protein in these sera could not be correlated with gastrointestinal disease nor to any specific immunologic parameter; however, for still unknown reasons, higher levels of these antigens in the blood were related to splenomegaly. Unlike IgA-deficient patients, hypogammaglobulinemic patients produce antibodies poorly or not at all, and the ingested dietary proteins do not elicit antibody production. Thus, dietary antigens do not engage in immune complex formation with endogenous immunoglobulin, although after infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin, immune complexes containing dietary antigens can be detected.",

Nine patients of the group were found to have infections with Giardia lamblia; there was one case each of salmonella infection and enteropathogenic E. coli infection (Lederman and Winkelstein, 1985). Systemic enterocytopathogenic human orphan virus (ECHO), coxsackievirus, and vaccine-related polio infections, harbored in the intestinal tract, have caused severe morbidity and high mortality rates among XLA patients (R.E. McKinney et al., 1977.) Campylobacter infections also occur in XLA. For unclear reasons, typical inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption, and celiac disease are quite uncommon in XLA. With the lack of antibody production, autoantibody-based gastrointestinal diseases are not found.",

This defect leads to a variety of infections and inflammatory conditions, but for each deficiency disease the manifestations vary. The role of IgA in intestinal immunity has been clarified by a number of studies, but what compensations are brought to bear when IgA is lacking is a mystery. Perhaps additional immune defects, yet to be discovered, exist in the IgA-deficient subjects who become ill. Another mystery is the relative lack of gastrointestinal disease in males with XLA, who have no B-cell immunity, compared with patients with CVID, who usually make some amount of functioning antibody. Perhaps here the most plausible explanation is that males with XLA have excellent T-cell immunity, whereas subjects with CVID usually have T-cell defects. Recent studies in knockout mice have indicated an essential role for T cells and cytokine regulation in intestinal mucosal integrity; perhaps it is the lack of these regulatory factors that predisposes patients with CVID to inflammatory mucosal diseases. Continued study of the congenital immune deficiency diseases will permit further analysis of normal gastrointestinal immunity.",
