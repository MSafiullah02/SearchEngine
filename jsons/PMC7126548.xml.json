Water ecology provides services such as food production, nutrient cycling, habitat provision, flood regulation, water purification and soil formation [1]. Biological and chemical contaminants in tap and drinking water, initiate the evolution of contagious diseases [2]. Therefore, fast and sensitive detection techniques are crucial to ensure safe and clean water supply. Unsafe water supply affects human health, causing contagious diseases such as hepatitis, influenza, SARS, pneumonia, gastric ulcers and pulmonary disease [3]. There are numerous non-biological contaminants existed in the water supply and some of the examples are silica, sodium, sulphur, ammonia and chlorine [4]. Other hazardous substance of heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg) and nickel (Ni) are also found in water supply [5]. These non-biological contaminants are among the commonly detected pollutants in urban areas that constitute a wide array of human activities.",

In addition to these contaminants, other concern on the water quality includes the existence of microbiological contaminants in tap and drinking water at point of consumption. Derivation of pathogenic activity in water supply poses serious threats not only to human but also the entire water ecosystem. Pathogenic microorganisms can be categorised into bacteria (e.g., Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholera and Shigella), viruses (e.g., Poliovirus) and protozoa (e.g., Giardia lambia and Cryptosporidium). These types of microorganisms have been periodically detected in the water samples of river, groundwater and drinking water [7], [8]. Hence, minimizing the exposure of deadly diseases is important by providing early warning detections on the presence of pathogens [9]. According to World Health Organization (WHO), the most commonly found microorganisms in the drinking water sources are Cryptosporidium, Legionella, Pseudomonas, Giardia and E. coli\n[10], [11], [12], [13]. A list of possible water supply contaminants that is based on standard guideline is summarized in Table 1\n.",

At the laboratory level, analyses are usually carried out by skilful personnel using high-end and cutting-edge technologies. Conventionally, multiple fermentation tube technique [15], [16], filtration method [17], [18], DNA amplification [19], fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) techniques [20], [21], capillary electrophoresis [22], [23], field-flow fractionation [24], [25], chromatography [26], [27] and mass spectrometry [28], [29] are the commonly used instruments to detect contaminants in the water samples. The potential benefits of laboratory-based analytical methods have been recognized for a long time, but studies have shown that they are not very efficient for on-site monitoring applications. With the technological advancement in the analytical chemistry, new techniques are developed through the introduction of advanced spectroscopy [30], model-based event detection [31], water quality sensors [32], [33], microfluidics [34], [35], [36] and biosensors [37], [38], [39]. Recently, wireless sensor network has been adapted in various detection techniques for portability. The evolution of water contaminant detection techniques is illustrated in Fig. 1\n.",

An initial growth in water quality sensor fabrication and optimal sensor placement for event detection has been introduced over the past several years [40], [41], [42], [43]. The synthesis of the aligned water sensors, also known as sensor placement approach, could improve the device detection performance by increasing the detection sensitivity [44], [45]. Deploying sensors in water distribution system allow the measurements of temperature, pH, turbidity, conductivity, oxidation reduction potential (ORP), UV-254, nitrate-nitrogen and phosphate both on-line and off-line. These water quality parameters are important to the treated water could meet the limit of detection (LOD) set by the United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) [46]. However, the installation of numerous sensors along the distribution system seems not very practical owing to high installation cost [47].",

Most of the water quality parameters are used as primary indicators for contamination events in WDS, which are obtained from an online database, such as CANARY Database [54], [55], [56], [57]. The main objective of the event detection method is to: (1) identify the possibility of event occurred, (2) characterize the event into subgroup (e.g., spatial area, time duration and severity level), and (3) detect contamination as accurately and early as possible. Achieving optimal time responses are superior for early indications of potential contaminants in WDS [58].

Reduction in DO content may reduce the survival rate of coliform bacteria in aquatic environments [80].

Limitation of selective culture or immunological methods due to lack of consistent differentiation in phenotypic traits may also affect detection accuracies [100]. The efficacy of various membranes was elaborated by Snyder et al. [101] in which MF is capable of reducing concentration of contaminants with specific properties. It was reported that the degree of contaminant removal was highly dependable on the characteristic of the membrane and the molecular properties of the targeted analytes. Microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes showed the least value of contaminant removal whereas reverse osmosis membranes are capable of removing almost all investigated contaminants [101].

Another example is conventional hot-start PCR technique for the detection of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans by heating the reaction components under DNA melting temperature before mixing with polymerase to reduce non-specific priming amplification [110], [111]. A touchdown PCR amplification was then established to identify the presence of bacteria in aquatic samples by gradually decreasing the primer annealing temperature in later cycles [112], [113], [114]. The analysis of bacterial water contaminant was performed using a universal conserved bacterial 16S rDNA sequence, which are specifically used for amplification of 16S rDNA fragments with GC-clamp-EUB f933 and EUB r1387 primers (Table 2\n).",

The RT-qPCR technique involves the hybridization of oligonucleotide primer to produce a complementary DNA (CDNA). This process of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) is used to eliminate contaminated DNA that triggers false positive results. The application of RT-qPCR assay approach has been used in detecting pathogens such as mRNA in E. coli cells [131], family of Filoviridae viruses and RNA transcription from Ebola viruses [132], cereulide-producing Bacillus cereus\n[133], RNA molecules of Salmonella\n[134] and rotaviruses and coronavirus in feces contaminations [135].

Therefore, an alternative to PCR is isothermal-based amplification methods. This method can be carried out without undergoing repeated thermal denaturation procedure and does not require sophisticated instruments [144]. Typically, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) mechanism comprises two pairs of primers (inner and outer) and are dependable to strand displacement synthesis of DNA polymerase to produce loops amplifications [145]. LAMP has been widely used for diagnosis of biological specimens and is commercially available for environmental monitoring applications [146], [147], [148]. It has high sensitivity and rapid detection capability as well as greater ability to quantify several bacteria [149], [150]. A pilot study was conducted to detect Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Acinetobacter baumannii using quantitative LAMP (qLAMP) with better identification (P < 0.001) than that of traditional culture-based method [151]. The functionality of loop primers designed for LAMP assays improved the detection specificities and sensitivities by several magnitudes [152]. This was proven by Sotiriadou and Karanis [153], by employing LAMP assays approach for the evaluation of Toxoplasma in water samples based on amplification of B1 and TqOWP Toxoplasma genes with 100% success detection rate. Separately, a gene amplification using hydroxyl naphthol blue could successfully detect Naegleria floweri within 90 min reaction time with a Kappa coefficient of 0.855 [154].",

Furthermore, it has greater sensitivity and can be potentially deployed for on-site water contaminant detection. Gallas-Lindemann et al. [155] reported that Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. could be detected using LAMP assays with 42.7% and 43.6% detection rate, respectively compared to 33.5% and 41.9% shown by the conventional nested-PCR. Besides, the LAMP technique offers 100% detection sensitivity with LOD of 50 fg/mL compared to the conventional PCR method [156]. Integrating the extension method with the standard PCR could provide faster, less false positive indicators, better compatibility for detection of multiple pathogens [157], [158], [159]. Moreoevr, LAMP was comparable to the qPCR method for surveillance of Dehalococcoides spp. in groundwater using six LAMP primers designed for each three RDase genes [160].",

However, no method is completely perfect by taking into account the principle and procedure of each method. For instance, the detection of pathogenic viruses is obtained in a disinfection procedure, but this method is not suitable for the detection of coliform bacteria due to low concentration of bacteria indicator [167]. The generation of DNA-based amplification method has evolved due to demands in producing combined method of detection with higher specificity and rapidity. Probe based real time loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT LAMP) assay was then introduced for the quantification of Salmonella invasion gene (InVA), aiming to achieve significantly higher sensitivity [168].",

            "text": "In situ hybridization is a technique that enables the detection, identification, localization and enumeration of microorganisms. Cellular component and targeted analytes can be visualized via fluorescence probe based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. The FISH technique has been used in a wide variety of research fields such as cytogenetic, microbiology and genetic diagnostics applications [169]. There are a few important factors such as probe design and fluorophore selections that need to take into consideration before execution of FISH experiments. Commonly used probe is 15\u201330 nucleotides long that is labelled with fluoorophore of 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 at each end. These probing designs are specifically used for the detection of microorganism and mRNAs as shown in Fig. 6\n. One of the earliest application to embrace the usage of FISH technique was microbial ecology. Similar to DNA amplification method, the most commonly used DNA probe is 16S rRNA sequences for the detection of bacteria in living tissues as well as in aquatic environment samples. In recent years, the FISH technique has been applied in microbiological monitoring field. However, FISH has low fluorescence signals which limits the detection factor to the specified microbial community [170]. To address this issue, a multi-labelled FISH technique is recommended so as simultaneous detection of microbial groups could be achieved by improving the fluorescence signals [171].",

However, the results showed that FISH method was not able to identify strains, i.e., B. altitudinis, B. cereus, B. gibsonii, B. pimulus and B. megaterium. The development of FISH technique over the past several years has increased its usage in determining various types of MRNA and DNA molecules [175]. Fluorescent nanomaterials, also known by quantum dots (QDs), have been introduced to improve fluorescent-brightness, photochemical cohesion and coherence emission spectra [176], [177], [178]. The QD-FISH method offers the ability to detect specific target genes. For instance, synthesis of biotin-streptavidin deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) labelled DNA probes via PCR using dNTP mixture enable the detection of Ectromelia virus (ECTV), a member of the Poxviridae family [179], resulting a genome detection of 80% after 36 h of post-infection with significant visual of red fluorescence. The detection of green micro-algae, U. prolifera using FISH was also carried out targeting the 5S rDNA of U. polifera, Ulva linza and Ulva flexuosa molecular genes using 5S-1 and 5S-2 probes [180]. Six species of green algae were also tested, however only U. prolifera could be labelled by both specific probes. Because of the complex structure of bio-analytes, direct detection and quantification of single-cell bacteria using FISH are rather difficult. Therefore, an additional combination of flax desegregation protocol with quantitative FISH technique is recommended [181].",

The movements of analytes through electrolyte solutions are directly proportional to the applied voltage, where high electric field leads to faster mobility. CE has the ability to perform separation in capillaries with diameters in mm and in micro to nano-fluidic channels. The CE technique is often related as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), however, there are other CE-based methods which include capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE), capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) and micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) [185].

Anions separation was executed simultaneously using a highly alkaline pH condition to attract a negative charge, triggering migration towards anode as shown in Fig. 7\n.

Because of this, herbicides could be detected using a novel MEKC method [191]. The composition of 25 mM borate, 15 mM phosphate, 40 mM sodium dodeclysulfate (SDS) and 3% (v/v) of 1-propanol at pH 6.5 was used as an optimum buffer.

The derivation of pesticides in water samples has been detected by using a novel approach of sensitive ultrasound-assisted temperature-controlled ionic liquid (IL) diquid \u2212phase microextraction combined with reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Five organophosphorus pesticides were investigated by varying the IL type, IL volume, ionic strength, sonication time, heating/cooling temperature, centrifugal time and speed. In comparison to the conventional liquid chromatography technique, the proposed method improved the extraction efficiency up to 98%. A selected group of pesticides in tap and drinking water was also distinguished using liquid chromatography in which pesticide dimethoate, carbaryl, simazine, atrazine, ametryne, tebuthiuron, diuron and linuron were perfectly isolated (Fig. 9\n) [210]. A series of gas chromatography (GC) with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector (NPD) has also been reported with the capability of detecting trace amount of eight different type of pesticides presented in drinking water [211]. Despite providing high detection sensitivity (Fig. 10\n), GC analysis is considered unsuitable for non-volatile and high molar mass compound such as pesticides [210].",

To date, profound usage of GC\u2013MS for the determination of DBPs is due to the wide range of available mass spectral library databases [216]. Unfortunately, GS-MS has limited detection sensitivity, which can only detect compounds with low molecular weight (< 800 g/mol) [217]. Hence, a new technique that combined multiple solid phase extraction (SPE), dual-column liquid chromatography high resolution-LCMS and precursor ion elimination (PIE) was proposed by Richardson et al. [218]. Verstraeten et al. [219] and Erickson et al. [220] also employed such technique to analyse public water samples that contained hormones, pharmaceutical personal care products (PPCPs), polyfluoroalkyl substances and herbicides. Barnes et al. [221] validated the occurrence of pharmaceutical contaminants using LC\u2013MS and reported that the concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine that exceeded 0.1 ng/L were recorded in 9 wells while another 5 wells showed 0.07 ng/L concengration. The determination of pharmaceutical contaminants could also be found in work of Llorca et al. [222] in which LC\u2013MS was used to detect 33 analytes. Other works on the detection of sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine in drinking water and groundwater can be found elsewhere [221], [222], [223], [224].",

It was initially introduced by Calvin Giddings to separate macromolecules and colloids [227]. The working principle of FFF is due to the use of external field that is applied perpendicularly to the direction of phase flow within a capillary to derive analytes separation. In comparison to traditional chromatography approach, FFF is beneficial to those of analytes detection techniques in terms of effective separation components, minimum shear degradation, ultra high resolution, adjustable separation ability and mild operation condition which allows fragile analytes analysis [228], [229], [230]. Measurements of colloidal phosphorus in natural waters were demonstrated using an asymmetric FFF technique integrated with high resolution of ICP-MS and membrane filtration [231]. This separation technique comprises two categories, which are centrifugal force-based sedimentation (SdFFF) and perpendicular flow-based (FlFFF) that is mainly used for discrimination of engineered nanomaterial (ENMs) in aquatic environments. High density particles, such as metallic nanoparticles with a relatively large size were detected by SdFFF [232], [233], [234] owing to their ability to achieve higher resolution during separations.",

Although chemical chromatography (HPLC, GC, GC/MS) could offer identification and quantification of analytes, it is only able to detect specific contaminants [244]. Besides, it often involves multi-stage protocols and suffers a number of biases, such as loss of absorption due to the high reactivity [245].

Hypothetically, contaminants could present at any point within a specified time period along the water distribution system. Some contamination events may not be detected because of inaccurate sensor placements and low detection sensitivity [258], [259]. Ever since the development of water monitoring technologies, detecting the presence of contaminants in the water supply has become an extremely complex task. Arrays of sensor platforms were implemented to identify unique contaminations according to the sensor capabilities [260]. A study conducted by Ostfeld et al. [261] evaluated the performances of different sensor placements by experimenting with 126 sensor node stations and 168 pipes, which were subjected to a simulation period of 48\u201396 h per step. Inaccurate analysis might occur as a result of long transmission delays and slow response times in capturing data using sensors [262], [263], [264]. In addition, sensor placement approach that requires major in-pipe water distribution system alterations could increase cost [265]. Although sensor placements are among the most analyzed research area, obtaining a \u2018perfect sensor\u2019 when any concentration of contaminants is in contact with the sensor leads to an immediate response, which is considered to be a complete uncertainty.",

The fabrication of micro-scale sensors can be found in the work of Jiang et al. [274] in which the customized sensors were employed to determine the bacteria concentration in drinking water. Having to adopt the principle of electrical impedance spectroscopy method, the design of a low cost and sensitive bacteria sensor was successfully developed (Fig. 13\n), aiming to achieve pre-concentration microfluidic-based with LOD of 10 bacterial cells per mL.

Recently, the studies based on nucleic acid amplification and detection assays using DMF technology could be found in several work [279], [280], [281]. The implementation of chip-based nucleic acid assays have led to a significant increase in microfluidic sensor production for the purification and extraction of nucleic acid samples.

[283] by integrating SU-8 polymer micro resonator layered on top of an EWOD plate system. This system only required a single droplet of less than 100 nL of a liquid sample to trigger the sensing process. This trial was the first demonstration of a EWOD-based micro resonator-sensing system with full droplet movement capability. Because of its low power consumption coupled with extremely small sample volume and small data sets, microfluidic sensing platforms are chosen for portable point-on-care (POC) diagnostic devices. In contrast to the low potential of the DMF system for large deployments of chemical and biological micro-reactor applications, an intelligent digital microfluidic system with fuzzy-enhanced feedback for multi-droplet manipulation has been developed by Gao et al. [284]. This pilot DMF prototype aimed to (i) improve complicated image signal processing by using the ability to profile different droplet hydrodynamics, (ii) preserve up to 21% of the charging time using fuzzy-enhanced controllability to enhance the DMF chip\u2019s lifetime and (iii) employ automation of multi-droplet routing countermeasure decisions in real-time. The DMF module was made of the following three operation layers: a chip holder, control electronics and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board. Volume growth of droplets enabled the execution of sensing module responses that were assembled between two adjacent electrodes. Samples of DI water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS were injected via a syringe pump into a 4 \u00d7 11 mm hole with a constant flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min. The analysis was then carried out using a 0.1 mol/L concentration of Na2CO3, PBS, CaCl2 and FeCl3.",

The detection limit concentration is as low as 10\u22126\n M TNT-specific impedance properties. Initially, the TNT was purposely attached to the peptide that was bonded to the electrode surface. This was to prevent electron transmission and allow electrode interface impedance. Signals was then transmitted to a smartphone app on real-time basis.

The excitation of a high-temperature energy source induces light emitted from matter, which is known as an optical emission. Classifications of light emission spectroscopy include absorbance, reflectance, chemoluminescence, luminescence and light scattering signal and optical-based spectroscopy [311]. Of the reported luminescence platforms, several characteristics have been associated with light emission spectroscopy. For instance, reagent-mediated activity in the form of a light emission medium was employed as an auxiliary reagent to detect and identify contaminants [312].

Having a clear view of nucleation and polymorphic transformation was found to be very informative in relation to Raman and NIR spectra relative to other probe. However, the ability to detect nucleation, crystal growth and polymorphic transformation by NIR was limited due to presence of water in the system [338].",

The non-destructive Raman approach has a fast operation time which enables detection of pesticides not only in the water samples but also food products. Raman spectroscopy is well recognized as a powerful method for the on-site evaluation and determination of chemical-biological molecular compositions [346].

Hence, a cell-based Raman spectroscopy biosensor was introduced by Ioan [347] to differentiate the biochemical changes that occurred in cells with a large range of toxic agents. The target samples were nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. An example of Raman spectra results is shown in Fig. 17\n(a) in which different target samples were found in a living cell. More importantly, the cell-based biosensor Raman spectroscopy was able to quantify and qualify between live and dead cells as shown in Fig. 17(b).",

The application of SERS technique is to discriminate antibacterial properties such as tranquilizer (phenothiazine), diclofenac sodium and diclofenac sodium \u03b2-cyclodextrin complex and non-natural \u03b2-amino acids [348]. In comparison with the Raman spectra signal analysis, the SERS spectra provided tremendous measurement information about the molecular structures and absorbance behaviours. A similar approach used for bacterial classification and discrimination was also reported in the work of Wu et al. [349] in which vancomycin-functionalized silver nanorod array (VAN AgNR) was considered. This analysis was conducted through the isolation of 27 different bacteria from 12 species. Measurements were obtained from an NIR diode laser excitation source at 785 nm, and underwent chemo-metric analysis using a combination of PCA and HCA approaches. The results showed that the use of VAN AgNR substrates tended to generate more SERS spectra, making the bacteria differentiation more accurately.",

In order to meet the need for reliable and sensitive methodology for the detection of nanoparticles in aqueous samples, a low-cost and portable detection assay was established to determine the reactivity and characterization of selected nanoparticles (Ag, Au, CeO2, SiO2 and VO2) with particle size ranging between 5 and 400 nm [364]. As a leading approach for detection and exploration of nanoparticles, whole-cell biosensors was developed by integrating golTSB genes from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium to induce Au (I/III) complexes as illustrated in Fig. 18\n[365]. The quantification of gold nanoparticle complexes with concentration as low as 0.1 \u03bcM was able to be identified. The fabricated biosensor was also used to identify other metal ions, including Ag (I), Cu (II), Fe (III), Ni (II), Co (II), Zn and Pb (II). This contradicted a previous study where the response of golB genes only increased in response to Au (III)-complexes but not other metal ions [366].",

In accordance with non-biological contaminants, a portable gold screen printed electrodes amperometric biosensor was developed by Salvador et al.

Antibody peroxide (AntiIgG-HRP) was used for the binding reaction between target analytes and 4e-BSA competitor. In the presence of analytes, stable signals were able to achieve within 10 s upon initial acquisition. Separately, Belkhamssa et al.

The analytes detection was observed through an immunoreaction of 4-nonylphenol and the accuracy of developed biosensor was validated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The outcomes are very promising with reproducibility of 0.56 \u00b1 0.08%, repeatability of 0.5 \u00b1 0.2% and LOD for nonylphenol as low as 5 \u03bcg/L.",

The results showed that the microsensor was able to detect nitrate concentration in water samples with LOD between 25 and 83 ng/L. However, the implementation of such sensor network on field is still at the early stage of development.",

Because of this reason, an event detection model-based approach known as integrated logit detection (ILD) was proposed, which is an extended statistically based fusing process of dynamic threshold method (DTM) [406]. These two event detection models generate algorithmic evaluations to explore the most effective training phase performance for identifying contaminants using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which represents the trade-off between false and true positive for probability threshold as shown in Fig. 19\n.

A variety of techniques for water quality event detection have been well-developed, including the statistical, heuristic, machine learning and optimization methods used to analyze contaminant changes and the possibility of contamination [417]. Unlike other available methods, developing a model-based detection scheme involves intensive computational algorithm [406].
