In addition the utility of each biochemical parameter in identifying exudates was evaluated by calculating sensitivity [Tp/(Tp/Fn)] and specificity [Tn/(Tn\n + \nFp)]. As transudates and exudates are complementary terms, we must emphasise that for any given analyte, the specificity for exudates corresponds to the sensitivity for transudates.",

In our study, classifying PEs into only exudate or transudate, according to the pathogenic process of formation, a TPp cut-off value of 35.0 g/l enabled separation of these two groups with similar accuracy to that reported in human studies.2, 21, 22 The reason for a higher cut-off value compared with that in humans may be due to the small number of animals enrolled in our study, the different level of serum protein of these two species, or the fact that 3/9 cats with a transudate received diuretic treatment prior to sampling (see later discussion). The same reasons could also explain why in our study a cut-off for TPr of 0.57 instead of 0.50 (cut-off used in human medicine)2 for exudates was obtained. In the only other veterinary study23 in which TPr was used to distinguish a transudate from an exudate a cut-off of 0.50 was used. No information was given regarding statistical method of selection of this value which enabled correct classification of 19/20 effusions for which this parameter was available.23\n",

These results are not surprising as most of the protein content of the exudative effusion is derived from the serum protein leakage through the compromised pulmonary or pleural microvasculature5 and a positive correlation between serum and pleural fluid total protein have been previously demonstrated.29 The importance of TPp should, therefore, be questioned when classifying effusions in dysproteinaemic patients. As the majority of, but not all proteins in the PE are derived from the serum, the TPr should not be affected to the same degree in the case of altered serum protein value. In fact only one of the three cats mentioned above had a low TPr. Similar conclusions were reported in a study in humans with PE.29\n",

Using ROC curve analysis we derived a cut-off value of 5900 \u03bcl which decreased specificity, but increased sensitivity and overall accuracy of the test (Table 2).

In Light's original study, LDHp was found significantly lower in human with transudates and a cut-off value of >200 IU/l was derived to separate transudates from exudates.2 Also in our study, LDHp was found to be significantly lower in cats with a transudate and using LDHp > 226 IU/l as a cut-off value, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100% in dividing transudates from exudates. The small difference in the optimum cut-off value between our study and Light's original study could be due to the small number of animals enrolled in our study, the use of different assays to measure LDH or the different inter-species levels of tissue LDH. To compare the LDHp value measured with different assays in human medicine, a pre-determined cut-off for LDHp is no longer used, but instead, two-thirds of the upper limit of \u2018normal\u2019 serum LDH have been suggested (modified Light's criteria).34 A reference range for serum feline LDH was not available, therefore, this method could not be used.",

Using only TPr and LDHp, but not LDHr, with the same cut-off values to Light's original study a previous veterinary study classified all the 22 cats with PE in the study correctly.23 In this study no explanation for the lack of use of LDHr was given neither was information given regarding how the cut-off value for LDHp was derived.23 In our study, simultaneous use of these three tests failed to perform as well as in Light's study (Table 2).

Three animals (effusions number: 18, 19 and 20; Table 1) had a very low GLUp concentration. Proposed mechanisms to explain the low glucose in the PE include use of glucose by pleural fluid constituents including leukocytes and free malignant cells, pleural membrane metabolism, especially by malignant cells, and abnormal transfer of glucose across diseased pleural membranes.40 Interestingly, all three effusions with low GLUp in our study had very high nucleated cell count (respectively 270.0, 81.2 and 22.1 \u00d7 109/l) compared to the other effusion samples (values from 0.3\u20139.2 \u00d7 109/l), and an inverse correlation between GLUp and TNCC was present. Therefore, the increased TNCC may have been responsible directly or indirectly for the low GLUp in these three effusions. Further studies should evaluate if GLUp and PE pH may be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes.",

Unfortunately, this type of effusion seems to be extremely rare in the feline population as apparent from our data and three other feline studies23, 42, 43 on PE in which only one cat in a total of 226 could be identified with this type of effusion. Thirdly in the case of chylous effusions our classification scheme fails to identify the pathophysiology of pleural fluid formation. In fact, due to the inflammatory reaction of the pleura associated with this type of fluid,16 the resultant effusion will have exudative characteristics whether formed secondary to an increase in hydrostatic pressure of the lymphatic vessels or due to increased permeability.",
