            "text": "During February 3\u20136, 2020, just a few weeks after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCOV-2019) in the city of Wuhan, Chinese investigators urgently initiated two clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for treating hospitalized adult patients with respiratory disease caused by the virus, lately known as COVID-19 (WHO formally named it on February 11, 2020). The first trial was to treat patients with severe symptoms [1] and the second one was to treat patients with mild\u2013moderate symptoms [2]. Both trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies, sponsored by the Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. To ensure the interests of patients and the objectivity of the trial sponsor and investigators, who were masked with respect to the treatment assignments on patients throughout the study, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was composed with five members: 2 medical experts, 1 epidemiologist, and 2 statistical experts, all were independent from the trial sponsor and investigators (see acknowledgement for DSMB member names). With the support of a CRO (Clinical Research Organization), contracted by the sponsor for the task of data management, a kick-off DSMB meeting was launched on February 12, 2020, where the study protocols were reviewed and DSMB Charter was approved, in which the subsequent meeting schedules, data format and monitoring guidance were established. For the rest of this paper, the Background section first addresses the feasibility issue and challenges for the DSMB, which were debated and presented to us prior to the formal kick-off meeting. Controversial exchange of opinions between investigators\u2019 consultants and DSMB on selection of endpoints to monitor is also discussed. The Methods section describes the statistical methods, type-I error rate preservation strategy, and the eDMC tool we used for interim data monitoring during this emergent epidemic situation. In the Results section, we use a diary style to document each DMC meeting by calendar date, highlighting the key findings, discussions, and recommendations to the sponsor and investigator team based on data and seemly trends at hand. Finally, in the Conclusion and Discussion section, with our experience in monitoring the key data from 237 patients sequentially, we comment on some weakness and strength of the trial design and suggest the treatment effect of remdesivir on severe COVID-19 cases. The data monitoring experience we gained by serving on this DSMB for the remdesivir trial in China should provide meaningful information for other researchers who are currently conducting COVID-19 trials globally.",

Some conjectured that given the epidemic in Wuhan City, enrollment of patients would be so fast that there would be no time or need for interim data monitoring and reviews. However, considering the 10-day treatment period and [up to] 28-day follow-up period and that remdesivir is an investigational drug, DSMB review was deemed feasible and necessary according to the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline [3] and the Chinese regulation on new drug research and development [4]. The DSMB was then commissioned. Given the urgent situation, the sponsor emphasized that the accumulative efficacy and safety information on this trial should be accessible by the DSMB as soon as possible so that the DSMB could make quick and scientifically sound decisions. The real challenge for the DSMB was to be highly efficient in data transmission and to monitor key efficacy and safety data in a very timely and scientific manner. The DSMB chose to use an eDMC system with a statistical tool called DDM (Dynamic Data Monitoring) software; see more description and use of DDM in the sequel.",

Besides DMC members, CRO data manager, and independent statisticians, other participants included the sponsor (Academy of Medical Sciences officials), principal investigators (clinicians) with their academic consultants, and a representative of Gilead Science Inc. (the drug supplier). The study status report outlined that 136 severely ill patients (out of 453 planned) had already been randomized (2:1 for remdesivir: placebo) in 3 hospitals/centers in Wuhan (out of 10 planned) for protocol [1]. Some centers were ready to enroll mild\u2013moderate cases within two days for protocol [2]. The DSMB hence requested to have the next meeting to review baseline, efficacy, and safety data of the first trial of severe cases within 7\u201310 days in anticipating its fast enrollment; subsequent data review could be weekly in principle or shorter depending on the patient enrollment.",

            "text": "For the efficacy data, there was dispute on the endpoints to be monitored and the frequency of monitoring. The protocol design referenced the World Health Organization\u2019s WHO R&D Blueprint [5] and specified the primary efficacy endpoint, which is time to clinical improvement (\u201cTTCI\u201d) censored at Day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 = discharged; 6 = death). See the complete description of the ordinal scale in the sequel and in the immediate Methods section. The protocol also specified that one interim analysis for efficacy and futility was to be conducted once half of the total number of TTCI events required had been observed. However, the DSMB had concerns on the TTCI. First, for severe cases, whose risk of death would conceivably be high, TTCI would be infinite/undefined for the dead. The censoring rule on 28 days makes no clinical sense for the dead, and would be indifferent between the dead and the lived who still did not reach 2-point improvement by Day 28. Second, patients might decline then rise on the scale along the 28 days; the choice of the first day reaching 2-point decline might not be meaningful if the patient worsened later. Third, patients with baseline score of 2 (hospitalization, not requiring supplemental oxygen) could not possibly improve two categories, but they were not excluded by the protocol. (Note: protocol later revised TTCI to \u201c2-point decline or discharge\u201d after learning our concern). Thus, instead, the DSMB proposed to use a secondary efficacy endpoint specified in the protocol to monitor the study, which was the 6-category ordinal scale itself, stratified by the baseline category, on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28, as the trial progresses.",

As the trial progressed, the trend of the test was to be monitored as patients accumulate and treatment days expand. The plan was also to display the distribution data by bar charts and the WMW rank-sum test on a \u201cradar\u201d screen. The \u201cradar\u201d screen is constructed by boundaries of conditional probabilities to show whether the rank-sum test is in \u201cfavorable,\u201d \u201cpromising,\u201d or \u201cunfavorable\u201d regions. The calculations of the WMW tests and conditional probabilities are facilitated by the Dynamic Data Monitoring (DDM) software in the eDMC system [6]. More details on the regions with associated conditional probabilities are given in the Result section where the DDM \u201cradar\u201d screen is described with graphical displays. The trace of the rank-sum test signals the trend of the trial result from time to time as patients being enrolled. During the early stage of the trial, we expected more data in earlier days and fewer data in later days of follow-up; data examination would be exploratory. Only if a consistent strong signal is indicated by the rank-sum test (i.e., falling in the favorable region), would the formal analysis on the protocol-designed primary endpoint, TTCI, be triggered. As time progressed, we would expect more patients to have longer follow-up data. Most of times, we planned to do exploratory analysis by examining the \u201cradar\u201d graphs. However, in case, it was needed to protect against an inflated false positive rate, especially at the later stage of the trial when sufficient number of patients were enrolled/followed up and we would examine multiple rank-sum tests on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28, the DSMB chose to use Hochberg\u2019s step-wise procedure [7] for protecting an overall alpha at 0.025 (1-sided, or 0.05 2-sided) level for this secondary endpoint.",

Moreover, anticipating the fast-pace enrollment and relatively short trial duration, and considering the urgent matter for the study, the DSMB chose the Pocock-type alpha-spending function for this primary endpoint. Note that the Pocock-type alpha-spending function being concave rather than convex, indicating that more alpha would be spent at earlier than later time, fits the urgent situation of the epidemic; see a previous discussion on choosing alpha-spending function in [9].",

The remdesivir regimen was the same as in the Chinese trials. DSMB noticed that the NIAID trial used a similar 8-category ordinal scale for the trial\u2019s primary endpoint. However, the in-patient follow-up time was 15 days, shorter than the 28 days as in the Chinese trials. Sample size was n = 440, similar to the sample size n = 453 for the Chinese trial with severe cases.",

The conditional power was calculated to project the chance that the final Z-value would be \u2265 1.96 (unadjusted for multiplicity), if the trial were to continue to the original final sample size of 435 patients, given the current estimate of treatment effect.",

The formal interim analysis of TTCI was not triggered because there were not enough events and the study was terminated prematurely owing to the timely control of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. With the data from 237 patients, however, we believe valuable information can still be extracted for the study design as well as on the treatment effect of remdesivir on COVID-19 severe cases.

In addition, there were negative Z-values of the WMW rank-sum test on the 6-category scale observed in early Days 3, 5, and 7 on the \u201cradar\u201d screen. In contrast, there was 2-day shorter median TTCI in favor of the remdesivir group. One possible explanation for this inconsonance could be just random chance, since none of the numerical comparisons could pass the common statistical significance level, although no formal calculation was conducted. Another reason could be that the TTCI censored the deaths on Day 28, distorted the TTCI in spite of higher mortality. The third explanation could be that TTCI only looked at the improvement side and forgot the worsening side, while 83.5% of patients were in the middle of the 6-category scale, who could go either direction. Using TTCI as the primary endpoint was a weakness of the study design. A 28-day landmark logistic regression analysis with a binary endpoint of a properly defined \u201cresponse\u201d might be a better choice.",
