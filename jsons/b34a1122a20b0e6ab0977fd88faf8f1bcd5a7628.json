Typical imaging findings include confluent ground glass opacities, consolidation and crazy-paving patterns. More severe COVID-19 cases are frequently accompanied by laboratory and immunologic changes like C-reactive protein increases, lymphopenia and IL-6 peaks [9] . It stands to reason that the integration of imaging and clinical data can aid in the prediction of a severe course of disease in COVID-19 pneumonia and aid in patient stratification and triage, critical especially in an overloaded health care system as was observed in Italy [2] and more recently, New York [10] .",

This is consistent with the typical finding of COVID-19 pneumonia, which often noted in the lower peripheral lobes of the lung, presumably involving the upper lobes in more advanced cases. This result, alongside the semi-quantitative severity score shows that simple metrics of pulmonary involvement can be used to predict clinical outcome. It remains unknown at this time how these imaging features relate to the individuals' viral load. However, it is assumed that SARS CoV2 replicates in the lung tissue and it has been postulated, that a failure to reduce viral load in the lung correlates with worse clinical outcome which in turn is associated with more severe imaging findings [22] . If confirmed, this hypothesis could also allow for patient stratification with regard to clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of anti-viral therapy. In the context of in-and outpatient management beyond the assessment of the need for ICU admission, CT imaging could enable the identification of patients with a high viral load/super spreaders even in the absence of severe symptoms and thus inform discharge management [23] [24] [25] . Lastly, similar to recent reports, we also identified CRP and IL-6 as important predictors of severe disease [9] .",
