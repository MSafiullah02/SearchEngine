Thus, reliable methods for characterization of and protection against bioaerosols are necessary to alleviate these concerns. Appropriate sampling is the basic step for bioaerosol characterization. Liquid impingement has been widely used for bioaerosol sampling due to its ability to preserve viability of microorganisms and their suitability for subsequent analytical studies. However, liquid impingers should be used for collection of bioaerosol particles only when inertial impaction of particles into liquid is the dominant collection mechanism, typically for sizes larger than 1 \u03bcm in diameter (Grinshpun et al., 1997, Willeke et al., 1998). For instance, the cut-off diameter of an All-Glass Impinger 30 (AGI-30) was reported about 0.3 \u03bcm (Lin, Willeke, Ulevicius, & Grinshpun, 1997).",

Due to their small size, viral aerosols are not effectively collected by current liquid impingers. Collection efficiency of an all-glass midget impinger with a standard nozzle was reported to be less than 20% for particles in the size range 20\u2013700 nm (Spanne, Grzybowski, & Bohgard, 1999). Hogan et al. (2005) also reported that collection efficiencies of an AGI-30 and an SKC Biosampler were less than 10% for particles between 30 and 100 nm. Thus, modifications or new techniques that ensure improved collection of ultrafine virus particles are necessary for the current liquid impingers to be used as reliable sampling devices for viral aerosols.",

The bioaerosol sample flow was passed over the water reservoir at the same temperature of the first heating tube to be saturated with water vapor, and entered the first heating tube, in which the saturation condition was maintained, and then passed through the second cooling tube, in which condensation occurred. Humidity at the exit of the heating tube was measured to ensure an ultimate relative humidity (RH) of at least 90%. Temperatures of both tubes were monitored by thermocouples, and the effective tube temperature differences were controlled by varying the amount of voltage supplied to the Peltier pumps.",

            "text": "Results from the mBAU test are also summarized in Table 1. As shown, the mBAU worked effectively as a virus amplification device, and number of viruses collected in the Biosampler increased 2\u20133 fold at the saturated air temperature (T\nsaturated-air) of 55\u201365 \u00b0C. The FCEs of the mBAU were 2.02\u00b10.48 and 2.22\u00b10.64 at T\nsaturated-air of 55 and 65 \u00b0C, respectively. Results of the PSD measurements also showed significant growth of virus particles in the mBAU.\nFig. 2 shows the changes in PSD of the aerosol flow after the mBAU at different T\nsaturated-air. As can been seen in Fig. 2, growth of particles was observed at T\nsaturated-air \u226555 \u00b0C, and changes in PSD were remarkable as T\nsaturated-air increased. More than tenfold increases in particle number concentration (>327 nm) were observed in the viral aerosol flow at T\nsaturated-air \u226555 \u00b0C (Table 1).\nFig. 3 illustrates the changes in PSD after the mBAU at T\nsaturated-air=65 \u00b0C when the particle-free air and the aerosols generated by nebulizing DI water and PSL suspension were used as the sampling flow. For the particle-free air \u2013 in which no nuclei were present \u2013 not many larger particles were detected after the mBAU. However, for the aerosol generated by nebulizing the DI water\u2013PSL suspension, which contained ultrafine particles, increased numbers of larger particles were observed. This proves that nucleation is not important under the tested condition, and that the particles detected by APS are truly amplified particles rather than nucleated. Considering relatively high concentration of PSL suspension (100 ppm) in the nebulizer, these amplified particles are not solely grown from singlet PSL particles (30 nm), but also from multiplet PSL particles (>60 nm) and surfactant residue in the suspension.",

Calculated saturation ratios in the mBAU agreed with our observations. Following the calculation method by Kousaka et al. (1982), saturation ratios at T\nsaturated-air=50 and 55 \u00b0C (T\naerosol=25 \u00b0C, RHaerosol=50%, and RHsaturated-air=100%) are 0.997 and 1.11, respectively, assuming adiabatic mixing in the mBAU. Since supersaturation condition is not attained at T\nsaturated-air=50 \u00b0C, growth of particles does not occur. At T\nsaturated-air=55 \u00b0C, the Kelvin diameter of Eq. (4) is 19.9 nm (smaller than single MS2 virus size), and condensational growth of virus particles initiates. However, these calculated values represent the ideal case of instantaneous mixing with no wall effects. Since we did not use high-energy jets in the mBAU to approach the adiabatic mixing condition, the real saturation ratio in the mBAU should be smaller due to interaction between water vapor and the wall. Thus, the saturation ratio at T\nsaturated-air=55 \u00b0C might not be sufficient for growth of single MS2 virus, causing the difference in PSDs of the grown MS2 aerosols between T\nsaturated-air=55 \u00b0C and 65\u201375 \u00b0C in Fig. 2. These results indicate that modifications of the current mBAU to ensure rapid mixing are necessary to improve the device\u2019s performance.",

At the optimal operating conditions, collection efficiencies of the SKC Biosampler for viral aerosols increased 2\u20133 times after they passed through the mBAU. Both PSD measurements and theoretical calculations prove that a supersaturation condition was attained and condensational growth of water vapor occurred on viral particles in the mBAU. To maintain the viability of MS2, the optimal temperature was approximately 65 \u00b0C. In contrast, the cBAU was not a practical amplification device for viral aerosols. The high molecular diffusivity of water vapor plus the temperature gradient in the cBAU caused condensation at the cold tube wall to predominate, allowing only slight particle growth.",
