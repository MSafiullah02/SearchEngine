Knowing the appropriate conditions and anatomical localization for measurement is the basis for the development of a non\u2010invasive diagnostic method which will be applicable for a large number of animals on farms. For this reason, precise information about thickness and extend of organ layers in healthy pigs were collected from frozen cross\u2010sections of the thorax and compared with the respective CT images. This was followed by a comparison with IRT images and the determination of regions of interest for temperature measurements. For the definition of health in this study, conventional diagnostic methods were extended and all relevant anatomical distances of the thorax were assessed. Patient\u2010related parameters such as inner body temperature, breathing and heart rate as well as a standardized and optimized ambient temperature were taken into account during the establishment of reference values for IRT images of the porcine thorax.",

All pigs were bred and raised in a closed breeding herd of high health status, routinely tested negative for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), toxigenic Pasteurella multocida, endo\u2010 and ectoparasites. After arrival, all pigs used in this study were checked for antibodies against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae using an Apx\u2010II\u2010Enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) (Leiner et al., 1999). Animals were housed and cared under standardized conditions according to the Directive of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrae Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (European Treaty Series, nos. 123 [http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/EN/treaties/html/123.htm] and 170 [http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/EN/treaties/html/170.htm]). All procedures were approved by the institutional review board as well as from the local ethics committee for animal experimentation (approval number: 33.14\u201042502\u201004\u201012/0835). Precautions aimed at avoiding unnecessary suffering were taken at all stages of the experiment. After arrival, an acclimatization period of at least 3 days started in which pigs adapted to the new environment and were monitored daily for clinical signs of illness. Systematically the following parameters were assessed daily: breathing noise, type of respiration, breathing rate, coughing, skin colour, posture, behaviour, feed intake, body temperature, and symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders as vomiting or diarrhoea. A clinical scoring system was applied to confirm that all twenty pigs that participated were clinically healthy, with scores ranging between 0.00 and 0.73 according to the classification by Hoeltig et al. (2009). Disease classification by clinical scores was: not affected (0\u20132.00), slightly affected (2.01\u201334.70), moderately affected (34.71\u201367.30) and severely affected (>67.30) (Hoeltig et al., 2009).",

Horizontal lines were tangential to the ventral edge of the bronchus trachealis, or tangential to the lung bifurcation in the precardial and cardial sections, and tangential to the oesophagus in the postcardial sections. Axial boundary lines were crossing the vertebral body and were placed right\u2010angled to the horizontal lines. All transverse cross\u2010sections were scanned for pneumonic changes as consolidations and ground glass opacities. If at least one consolidation or ground glass opacity was detected within one quadrant, one scoring point was counted, so that a maximum score of four could be reached for one transversal CT image. In addition, tissue densities were measured within a circular region of interest (ROI) with an area of 120 mm2 in the centre of a consolidation. ROIs did not contain air ways, blood vessels or other interfering elements. The mean density (mean HU) was translated from the optical speckles in the selected area by the imaging analysis software. Within each transversal cross\u2010section only the consolidation with the highest density was scored as follows: <(\u2212550) HU no scoring points; from (\u2212550) to (\u2212150) HU two scoring points; >(\u2212150) HU four scoring points. Based on these two scorings, the maximal total score for each single transverse cross\u2010section was eight.

Distances between db, vb, and H were measured and subdivided into three dorsal and two ventral segments, to create two additional auxiliary lines: between the upper and middle thirds of the dorsal area (dL) and between the two halves of the ventral area of the lung (vL). Thickness of skin, muscle, lung tissue, airways, liver and heart tissue was measured along the three auxiliary lines (db, H, vb) on both sides, i.e. left and right.

For this reason difference temperatures were measured between two ROIs on the body surface as a practical approach to overcome these technical device errors. A precondition to measure temperature differences between different ROIs is the specification of two anatomical localizations which can be repeatedly found in the IRT image. At these anatomical localizations ROIs can be positioned. Difference imaging eliminates off\u2010set errors which vary between different IRT images. In the used IR camera the absolute measuring accuracy was \u00b11.5\u00b0C according to the manufacturer's instructions.",

Therefore, the isolation of microorganisms by itself has no significance for the health status of pigs (Hensel et al., 1994). In the examined pigs, no pathogens were detectable and no gross pathological changes were found. Lung tissue histology resulted in a mild interstitial pneumonia which is regularly found in healthy pigs and might be a balanced reaction to commensal bacteria or abiotic factors (Hennig\u2010Pauka et al., 2012). Hansen et al. (2010) found interstitial lung lesions in 50% of the control pigs previously defined as healthy and at least one pathogen was detected from lung samples. In an extensive study for the assessment of lung health status of fattening pigs, which were held in different housing systems, an increase of lymphocytes and histiocytes within the inter\u2010alveolar walls was also detected in all healthy pigs, which is consistent with the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia in the study (Rieger, 2005).",

Another reason for false positive findings in CT images might be attributed to fluid accumulation in the ventral parts of the lung due to ventral recumbency. In this posture lung tissue is gravitationally compressed during the respiratory cycles, as the pig was not in its natural standing position (Wandtke et al., 1986; Verschakelen et al., 1993).
