First, we identified the key components of the health care system needed to effectively deliver ventilation therapy to patients. Second, we quantified the maximum number of additional ventilators that each of the key components could effectively support at various capacity levels (ie, conventional, contingency, and crisis).\n6\n According to the Institute of Medicine, conventional capacity is defined as usual and normal patient care in which facilities and staff meet their normal goals in providing care. Contingency capacity requires minor adaptation that may have minor consequences for standards of care, but adaptations are not enough to result in significant changes to standards of care. Crisis capacity is defined as a fundamental, systematic change in which standards of care are significantly altered to allow treatment of a greater number of patients.\n6\n Third, we determined the constraining key component at each capacity level to determine the system\u2019s surge capacity.",

Each non-critical-care physician would manage up to 6 patients, providing a patient-to\u2013critical care physician ratio of 24:1 consistent with the Task Force for Mass Critical Care recommendations for a physician two-tier staffing model. For critical care nurses, we assumed that 3 non-critical-care nurses would work under the supervision of a critical care nurse, and each non-critical-care nurse would manage up to 2 patients, providing a range of patient-to\u2013critical care nurse ratios of from 3:1 to 6:1.\n15\n Similarly, for respiratory therapists, we assumed that up to 4 respiratory extenders would work with a respiratory therapist and each respiratory extender would manage up to 3 patients, providing a range of patient-to\u2013respiratory therapist ratios of from 10:1 to 12:1. Respiratory extenders could be respiratory therapists working in administrative positions, respiratory therapy students, nurses, and other health care professionals involved in patient care.\n14\n\n,\n\n15\n All of the patient to staff ratios used for contingency and crisis capacity levels in this assessment were previously recommended by the Task Force for Mass Critical Care and Project Extreme.\n13\n\n-\n\n15\n Finally, to project the number of medical personnel who would be available at each capacity level, we divided the number of staff in each medical personnel category by the number of shifts per day (two shifts per day), and multiplied the outcome by the 10% to 20% staff availability. This value was then multiplied by the patient-to-provider ratio to obtain the number of patients who could be treated for each medical personnel category at the peak of an influenza pandemic outbreak.",

This assessment showed that the number of total additional mechanical ventilators that could effectively be used during the peak of a severe influenza pandemic ranged from approximately 26,200 to 56,300. This range represents the projected number of additional mechanical ventilators that could be effectively used by the US health care system at the lower boundary of contingency and crisis capacity levels at the peak of a severe influenza pandemic. As we approach the upper boundary of the range at 56,300 ventilators, subject matter experts interviewed as part of this project expressed concern that various components of the health care system would become stressed, and there is uncertainty that health care services could be effectively delivered.",

The assumptions and data used in the assessment presented here at the contingency and crisis capacity levels were based on the best available evidence but were largely untested. In addition, we made simplified model assumptions to approximate surge capacity projections. For example, we assumed a static range for bed availability (10% to 20%) that does not account for daily variation in bed availability. Furthermore, we did not calculate the difference between the surge capacities of pediatric staffed beds and adult staffed beds because our model was intended to illustrate a general concept for assessing surge capacity in a large-scale PHE. Our model can be applied to any specialty population or setting if the right numbers and assumptions are applied. However, we cannot say for sure that the public health implications of our results hold true across pediatric critical care settings, because our model did not attempt to answer this question specifically. Finally, we did not incorporate the \u201csystems\u201d component, such as resource sharing among facilities in the same network, or additional factors such as communications and logistics planning into this assessment because these factors and their potential impacts, although important, were difficult to quantify.",

For effective planning, emergency planners at all levels need to understand their health care systems\u2019 capacity to expand care for a surge of critically ill patients and the capability to absorb additional resources. This assessment provides a model for projecting a health care systems\u2019 surge capacity for large-scale PHEs. This model can be adopted and adapted to assist emergency planners at the facility, local, and state levels to identify gaps in emergency preparedness, determine stockpiling goals for critical care resources, and identify alternative policies and protocols to manage increased need for critical care resources in a large-scale PHE.",
