            "text": "Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is an uncommon malignancy involving the lymph nodes and lymphatic system, with a crude incidence of 2.3 cases/100,000 individuals in the EU [1] and an estimated 9190 newly diagnosed cases in the USA in 2014 [2]. The disease most often affects young adults (aged 15\u201330 years [2]; 20\u201340 years [1]), with a second peak occurring in individuals aged >55 years [1, 2]. There are two main types of HL, namely classical HL (accounts for 95% of cases; focus of this review) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL [1, 2]. Classical HL is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, with these cells consistently expressing the cell membrane receptors CD30 and CD15 [1, 2]. Advances in the management of HL means that newly diagnosed patients with classical HL have a very good prognosis, with more than 80% of patients experiencing a clinical cure after front-line therapy [2\u20135]. However, in early and advanced stage disease, \u22485 and 30\u201340% of patients, respectively, relapse after front-line therapy [3, 4]. The standard care for patients with relapsed or refractory disease is salvage therapy with second-line high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) in those eligible for transplant [3, 4], with only 50% of patients cured with standard salvage therapies [5]. Patients who relapse after salvage HDCT/ASCT generally have a poor prognosis [3, 4].",

One such ADC is brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS\u00ae), which targets the CD30 membrane receptor, a tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member [6, 10, 11]. CD30 is an ideal target for ADC-based therapy, given its high levels of expression on specific tumour cells (including classical HL and sALCL cells) and limited expression on normal cells (restricted to a small population of cells, predominantly activated B cells and T cells) [6, 10, 11]. In addition, CD30 is consistently expressed on HL and sALCL cells irrespective of disease stage, line of therapy or transplant status [8, 12].",

The binding of brentuximab vedotin to CD30 on the tumour cell membrane triggers a cascade of events that ultimately results in apoptotic death of the CD30-expressing tumour cell (Fig. 1) [6, 10, 11]. In vitro studies indicated that prior to internalization of brentuximab vedotin, MMAE was stably attached to the antibody (only 2% of MMAE was released from the ADC during 10 days of incubation in human plasma), but was readily cleavable by lysosomal proteases [10, 14, 15]. Approximately four molecules of MMAE are bound to each antibody molecule in the ADC [10, 14, 15].\n",

In cultured HL and ALCL cells, the maximum concentration of brentuximab vedotin bound to CD30 on the cell surface was attained after 24\u201348 h of incubation, with concentrations decreasing by 120 h, indicating internalization of the ADC complex [16]. These in vitro data were confirmed in tumour biopsies from a patient with ALCL receiving brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg in a phase 1 trial. In tumour biopsies, there were numerous apoptotic cells 48 h after brentuximab vedotin treatment, with maximum concentrations of bound brentuximab vedotin attained within 24 h and concentrations decreasing within 48 h [16].",

In patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLCR) <30 mL/min; n = 3], MMAE exposure was approximately twofold higher than in patients with normal renal function [12, 19], with no effect observed in patients with mild (CLCR >50 to 80 mL/min; n = 4) or moderate (CLCR 30\u201350 mL/min; n = 3) renal impairment [12].

Consequent to higher MMAE exposure, adverse reactions of at least grade 3 may be more frequent in patients with severe renal impairment relative to patients with normal renal function and more frequent in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment relative to patients with normal hepatic function [19].",

Brentuximab vedotin treatment improved PFS compared with placebo (i.e. HR <1) in pre-specified subgroup analyses by baseline stratification factors, including best response to salvage therapy pre-ASCT, HL status after front-line therapy, ECOG status, the number of systemic treatments pre-ASCT, positron emission tomography (PET) status pre-ASCT and extranodal involvement at pre-ASCT relapse. Of interest, the beneficial effect of brentuximab vedotin therapy on PFS in patients who were PET-negative pre-ASCT was marginal (HR \u22480.95; value estimated from graph); however, these data should be interpreted with caution as PET scans were not per-protocol mandated (approximately two-thirds of patients had a pre-ASCT PET scan) and no objective criteria were required for interpretation of these PET scans [20].",

Of the 34 patients who achieved a CR, the estimated duration of response had not yet been reached, with 47% continuing to be disease progression-free after a median observation period of 53.3 months. In patients who were in CR, the respective estimated 3-year PFS and overall survival rates were 58 and 73%. Baseline characteristics in patients who achieved a CR were younger age, good ECOG performance status and lower disease burden, all of which were favourable prognostic factors for overall survival [28]. At study closure (\u22485 years\u2019 after the last enrolled patient\u2019s end-of-treatment visit; median follow-up 35.1 months), the estimated 5-year overall survival and PFS rates in the overall population were 41 and 22%, with respective rates in patients with a CR of 64 and 52% [29].",

The objective response rate of 60.5% in 37 patients who had received a prior allogeneic SCT was consistent with that in overall population (60.4%). Best response rates were consistent across most subgroups, although older patients had poorer response rates (an objective response was achieved by 39.3% of the 28 patients over 60 years of age). The median duration of response in those who had achieved an objective response after a median of four cycles was 8.4 months, with a median PFS duration of 11.3 months (vs. 6.8 months in the overall cohort). Median overall survival duration was not reached at a median follow-up of 16.1 months, with estimated 1- and 2-year overall survival rates of 76.4 and 57.8%. In patients who received consolidation ASCT (n = 29) or allogeneic SCT (n = 28) following brentuximab vedotin therapy, there were no significant between-group differences in terms of best response rates (27 patients in each group had an objective response), median duration of response (not yet reached and 17.3 months), median PFS (not yet reached and 18.1 months), and estimated 1-year (88.7 and 87.1%) and 2-year (79.9 and 81.3%) overall survival rates.

Conversely, URTI occurred significantly less frequently in older than younger patients (10 vs. 31%; p = 0.0049) and arthralgia occurred with a numerically lower frequency (8 vs. 21%).

With consolidation therapy, the most common TEAEs (i.e. incidence \u226520%) of any grade occurring in the brentuximab vedotin group were PSN (56 vs. 10% in the placebo group), neutropenia (35 vs. 29%), URTI (26 vs. 0%), fatigue (24 vs. 2%), peripheral motor neuropathy (23 vs. 6%), nausea (22 vs. 3%) and diarrhoea (20 vs. 2%), with most TEAEs being of mild to moderate severity [20]. TEAEs of at least grade 3 severity that occurred with an incidence of \u22652% in the brentuximab vedotin group and a higher incidence than in the placebo group were PSN (10 vs. 1%), neutropenia (29 vs. 10%) and peripheral motor neuropathy (6 vs. 1%). One recipient of brentuximab vedotin therapy developed febrile neutropenia, with neutropenia leading to dose delays in 22% of patients, none of whom discontinued treatment or required dose reductions. In the brentuximab vedotin group, peripheral neuropathy had a median time to onset of 13.7 weeks, resulted in treatment discontinuation in 23% of patients and dose modifications in 31% of patients. More than half (57%) of the 51 patients with peripheral neuropathy who required dose modifications completed all 16 cycles of brentuximab vedotin therapy. Pulmonary toxic effects occurred in 5% of patients in the brentuximab vedotin group and 3% of patients in the placebo group. In the brentuximab vedotin group, one patient died because of treatment-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with pneumonitis within 30 days of treatment, with another patient dying from ARDS at day 40 after treatment-related pancreatitis (resolved at the time of death).
