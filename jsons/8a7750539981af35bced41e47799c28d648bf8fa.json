            "text": "Background: Prophylactic vaccines are critical in preventing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) primarily caused by human enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Children aged less than 5 years are especially susceptible to EV71 infections. In addition to the development of vaccines containing the inactivated virus, those containing virus-like particles (VLPs) with repeated antigens also constitute an effective preventive strategy for EV71 infections, with safety and productivity advantages. We previously developed a fusion protein composed with truncated peptides of the EV71 capsid protein, which assembled into spherical particles. This study aimed to assess the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of EV71 infection. Methods: To evaluate the protective effect of fusion protein vaccine candidate, neonatal mice born by immunized female mice, as well as normal neonatal mice immunized twice were infected with EV71 virus. Whereafter, the survival rates, clinical scores and viral loads were measured. Results: The high dosage and booster immunization helped induce specific serum antibodies with high neutralization titers, which were transferred to neonatal mice, thereby facilitating effective resistance towards EV71 infection. An active immune response was also observed in neonatal mice which generated following immunization. Conclusions: The present results suggest that this fusion protein is a suitable vaccine candidate in treating EV71 infections.",

            "text": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is extremely contagious and prevalent among infants and children aged less than 5 years. Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been considered the major pathogen for HFMD, having triggered several disease outbreaks worldwide with high morbidity and mortality rates since its initial isolation in 1969 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Multiple countries in America, Europe, Australia and Asia had seen the EV71 epidemic since 1970s [2] [3] [4] [5] . During 1997 and 1998, several EV71 outbreaks occurred in Asia, including Sarawak, Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan, while fatal cases were reported [6] [7] [8] [9] . The latest large Asian epidemic was in mainland China during 2007 and 2008, with 488,955 cases as well as 126 deaths reported [10, 11] . Since the establishment of national surveillance system in 2008, more than 15 million HFMD cases were reported according to the China National Center for Disease Control (CDC) by 2015, with over 3400 deaths. EV71 predominated among the laboratory-confirmed cases, especially for the severe and fatal cases [12, 13] . Meanwhile, various EV71 vaccines have been developed , and since 2015 three EV71 vaccines have been approved by Chinese FDA to prevent the continuous epidemics [14] [15] [16] , which were separately developed by Institure of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS, Kunming Institute), Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., and China National Biotech Group. All approved vaccines comprise inactivated viruses with the obvious advantage of almost complete immune protection; in fact, the vaccines are proved to protect over 90% vaccinated children from EV71-related HFMD or herpangina [10, 14, 15, 17] .",

There're also two inspiring examples, VLP-based hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus vaccines, which have been successfully commercialized [23, 24] . Recombinant EV71 VLPs can resemble the natural virus structure in terms of their capsid proteins. Immunization with such VLPs can induce EV71-specific immune response with high neutralizing antibody titers and increased cytokines in mouse model [18, [25] [26] [27] . Considering the EV71 inactivated whole-virus vaccines are unable to prevent infection caused by other major agents of HFMD, such as CA16, CA10 and CA6, multivalent vaccines deriving from VLPs are regarded as another option for disease prevention [12, 24] .",

Furthermore, we engineered these peptides into one fusion protein (including P 70-249 , P 324-443 and P 746-876 ), using a prokaryotic expression system. The expressed fusion protein finally assembled into spherelike particulates (VLPs) of 25-40 nm, and were proved to induce humoral and cell-mediated immunity effectively in mice after vaccination, with the detection of high-titer antibodies and promoted splenocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion [18] . In this study, we further investigated the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein, using a mouse model of EV71 infection, including its effects on the production of neutralizing antibodies, the immunoprotective role of maternal antibodies in neonatal mice, and the protection of active immunization in neonates.",

Six-week-old female mice were vaccinated twice with fusion proteins (0.04 \u03bcg, 2 \u03bcg, or 10 \u03bcg, respectively), positive control (inactivated virus) and negative control (E. coli lysate), and their neonatal mice (1day-old) were used for the subsequent experiment. No adverse effects of pre-mating immunity on normal pregnancy and production of female mice were found, and no significant differences in physiological status of their neonatal mice were found either, compared to normal female or neonatal mice (data not unshown).When infected with 200 LD 50 of MP10 (a mouse-adapted EV71 strain), all negative control mice died 6 days-post-infection (d.p.i), while those in the positive control group still survived at 10 d.p.i. For the fusion protein immunization group, with an increase in the level of fusion protein, the survival rate of the neonatal mice also increased from 23% (0.04 \u03bcg) to 54% (2 \u03bcg) and to 87% (10 \u03bcg). The protective effect of maternal antibodies was more obvious when encountering a minor viral challenge with 10LD 50 . Except for the lowest dosage group (0.04 \u03bcg), immunization with the fusion protein completely inhibited EV71-mediated damage to neonatal mice. In contrast, mice in the negative control group died at 8 d.p.i, while those in the positive control group survived. Hence, similar to immunization with the inactivated virus vaccination, immunization of dams with the fusion protein effectively protected the neonatal mice against EV71 infection in cases of an infection at a low viral load.

From the 4 d.p.i of symptom onset, the clinical scores of the mice in the fusion protein immunization group were significantly lower than those of the negative control group (Fig. 4a) . Similar to the inactivated virus group, the average clinical score of mice in the fusion protein immunization group peaked at 4 d.p.i, and then gradually decreased until the symptoms alleviated on 13 d.p.i. Furthermore, viral replication was assessed in hind limb muscle tissue of mice, since the skeletal muscle was considered the primary site for viral amplification after EV71 infection (Fig. 4b) . Viral RNA in the muscle of mice in the fusion protein group was approximately 10 6 copies/mg on 3 d.p.i., which reduced to 10 4 copies/mg at 5 d.p.i., being significantly lower than that of the negative control. In summary, the fusion protein exerted an excellent active immunoprotective effect on neonatal mice, albeit still inferior to the inactivated virus.",

            "text": "Prophylactic vaccines are extremely important to prevent the EV71 epidemic, especially for susceptible children. Owing to their complete immunoprotective activity, viral inactivated vaccines are the preferred treatment strategy. In mainland China, the development and clinical evaluation of inactivated EV71 vaccines and the promotion of vaccinations have progressed rapidly to prevent the prevalence of HFMD caused by EV71 infection [14] [15] [16] [17] 33] . Meanwhile, to compensate for the low productivity deficits of inactivated vaccines, other strategies for vaccine development have been considered. Notwithstanding advancements in DNA vaccines [34] , those containing recombinant protein subunits [35, 36] , and those containing live attenuated viruses [37] [38] [39] , VLPs have yielded more advantageous recombinant vaccines. VLP vaccines can fuse multiple antigenic sites together to completely expose epitopes on the surface, thereby inducing a more effective immune response [20, 22, [24] [25] [26] [27] 40] . A novel EV71 VLP lacking VP4 (designated VLP \u0394VP4 ) structurally mimics the 80S empty capsid, which is the end stage of EV71 uncoating, thereby exhibiting desirable immunogenicity and protection as a vaccine candidate [22] . A tetravalent VLP vaccine comprising CVA10-VLP, EV71-VLP, CVA16-VLP, and CVA6-VLP reportedly elicited antigen-specific lasting serum antibody responses with neutralization titers similar to those of their monovalent counterparts. Most importantly, passively transferred tetravalent vaccineimmunized sera showed efficient protective effects against single or mixed infections with EV71, CVA16, CVA10, and CVA6 viruses in mice [24] . HFMD is a multi-pathogen disease with more than 20 pathogens, and cases of CA16, CA10 and CA6 infection have increased year by year. Therefore, it's necessary to develop multivalent vaccines, and VLP vaccines can be a potential choice.",

Subsequently, using a highly efficient prokaryotic expression system, the fused protein was expressed as inclusion bodies and dissolved, purified, and refolded to form pentameric molecules, and finally assembled into spherical particles [18] . In the present study, we further assessed the immunoprotective effects of the fusion protein as a vaccine candidate. The highest dosage of the fusion protein (10 \u03bcg for immunization) and booster immunization induced specific serum antibodies with the highest neutralization titers, and the protective antibodies were transmitted from the dams to the progeny, thereby protecting the neonatal mice from EV71-mediated damage. Meantime, immunoprotective effects were also observed in neonatal mice after immunization with the fusion protein. Combined with the increased proliferation of splenocytes and secretion of cytokines (including IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5), according to our previous report [18] , the fusion protein effectively induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.",

Since EV71 induced IgG was permitted to enter into brain tissues by the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after EV71 infection, cross-reactivity might result in neurological symptoms [31, 41, 42] . In addition, a common epitope (PPGAPKP) between capsid VP1 protein and human mediator complex subunit (MED25) was identified, suggesting the involvement of the immune response in neurological complications caused by EV71 infection [43] . The component fragment P 746-876 and P 324-443 of the fusion protein displayed weak positive crossreactivity, hence probably resulting in weak crossreactivity of the entire fusion protein. However, after immunizing neonates with the inactivated whole virus, no case of side reaction in brain was reported; hence, we presumed that the cross-reactivity may have resulted from the exposure of intracellular cross-antigens during the preparation of brain tissue sections, and it has been suggested that immune cross-reactivity should be monitored upon administration of the whole inactivated virus vaccine to children with neurological diseases.

Upon fusing the four gene fragments, the expression and purification of the four proteins was reduced to that of one corresponding protein, thereby saving time and production expenses. Moreover, compared with vaccines containing inactivated virus, the present vaccine candidate containing this fusion protein has a greater advantage with respect to its production and aggregation of dominant epitopes. Although its immunoprotective effect was inferior to that of the vaccine containing inactivated virus, it evidently exerted adequate immunoprotective effects via antibody production to prevent EV71-mediated damage to neonatal mice, thereby being a promising therapeutic alternative.",
