It typically involves patients over 60 years of age with predisposing factors. The clinical course is generally subacute, but the mortality rate is high despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Hemoptysis is uncommon in adults [3, 4] and reports of massive hemoptysis have been described especially in children [5, 6, 7]. We describe three new consecutive cases of life-threatening hemoptysis in adults with Sa-CAP, discuss the role of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and focus on the particular clinical presentation of this new entity recently referred to as \"Staphylococcus aureus necrotising pneumonia\" [6].",

He had undergone surgery for throat cancer in 1994 and was on enalapril for hypertension. Two days prior to admission he had been prescribed amoxicillin and steroids for chills, dry cough and fever. On admission his temperature was 38\u00b0C, heart rate 110 beats/min and respiratory rate 22 breaths/min under high-tension oxygen mask. His blood pressure was 140/70 mmHg. Physical examination was normal except for diffuse pulmonary crackles. Chest X-ray examination showed alveolar opacities of the left lung; alveolar opacities were diffuse over the entire lungs on pulmonary computed tomography (CT), but CT was non-contributory regarding the cause of massive hemoptysis. Blood gas values on 9 l oxygen/min were as follows: pH 7.28, PCO2 40 mmHg (5.3 kPa) and PO2 80 mmHg (10.6 kPa). The circulating white-cell count was 4000\u00d7109/l, hematocrit 39% and platelet count 207,000\u00d7109/l. The prothrombin time was 78% and creatinine 117 \u00b5mol/l. Electrocardiogram was normal and mitral stenosis was ruled out by cardiac echography. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) showed active bleeding, predominantly from the left main stem bronchus, with bilateral flooding. Tracheal aspiration (TA), telescopic protected brushing (TPB) and blood culture (BC) were performed for microbiological analysis. Direct examination of Gram-stained smears of TA and TPB was negative.",

Blood cultures remained sterile but culture of the tracheal aspirate yielded a methicillin-sensitive Sa secreting PVL. Tests for viruses, fungi and autoantibodies (see case report 1) were negative. Autopsy revealed necrotic lesions of the bronchial wall, epithelial damage with necrotic lesions and numerous cocci. There was no parietal infiltration by neutrophils nor bronchial suppuration.

Heart disease (congestive heart failure and mitral stenosis) was ruled out by cardiac echography. Only patient 2 had evidence of renal failure, thrombocytopenia and clotting disorders, but these were related to septic shock; indeed, necropsy revealed no specific lesions other than those resulting from bacterial pneumonia. Tuberculosis and aspergillosis were also ruled out. Goodpasture's syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis and systemic lupus erythematosus were unlikely causes of the hemoptysis, as tests for AGBM, ANCA and ANA autoantibodies were negative. Finally, fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed no endobronchial lesions, and CT (cases 1 and 3) and lung necropsy (case 2) showed no underlying parenchymal, bronchial or vascular disease.",

PVL belongs to a family of synergohymenotropins secreted by fewer than 2% of Sa strains [10, 11]. It is found in 75% of patients with furunculosis [12]. Its pathogenicity is related to its toxicity for white cells, especially neutrophils, to which it binds via a G-protein-coupled specific membrane receptor [13]. This interaction leads to PVL-concentration-dependent neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, followed by capillary dilation, leukocyte diapedesis and vascular necrosis due to release of oxygen metabolites, IL-8, LTB4 and enzymes, as demonstrated in animal models [14, 15]. We hypothesized that a similar phenomenon occurs in the pulmonary vascular beds of our patients leading to intense bleeding and alveolar flooding, an unusual mechanism of dyspnea among patients with CAP. In addition, the pathogenicity of PVL might explain the leucopenia also observed in two of our patients (2 and 3) [6].",
