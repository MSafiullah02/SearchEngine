In the ensuing communication, I will review some of these changes and their effect on journal success, with specific reference to those that have formed a foundation for future improvement.",

Consistent with this view, I have previously provided an accounting of journal improvements in the efficiency of processing, printing, and disseminating manuscripts.2, 3 These efforts continue as we receive ever-increasing numbers of manuscripts of historical complexity and quality. It would appear that we are nearing the asymptote of efficiency using existing models of processing and must explore new techniques if we are to continue to thrive. To address this challenge, in mid-2004 we will introduce a commercially available, well-respected electronic manuscript submission, review, and tracking system. Care will be taken to activate the system in a fashion and time course that will encourage new manuscript submissions but not estrange our existing loyal supporters.",

In this regard, the journal has had considerable success. Currently, the journal has a circulation of 130,000 per issue, and \u201creadership\u201d among our general/internal medicine audience (assessed by the commercial firm PERQ/HCI, Princeton, NJ) has shown impressive growth. The end result is that Mayo Clinic Proceedings now joins JAMA and The New England Journal of Medicine as the 3 journals with the largest outreach to the general/internal medicine audience and the most extensive readership within that audience. The Proceedings will continue making improvements to ensure absolute long-term growth in the raw data that underlie these rankings.",

This has changed with the evolution of the journal. Although it is difficult to quantify and communicate the progress made to date, 2 useful metrics are journal impact factor (which identifies how frequently Proceedings articles are quoted by subsequent authors) and reporting of our articles in the lay media. In the past 3 years, the Proceedings impact factor has increased from a baseline value of 2.02 to 2.24 to 2.64 to 2.87 (ISI, Philadelphia, Pa), a cumulative increase of 42%. Students of impact factor measurements will note that the calculation and alteration of an impact factor take years to evolve. Hence, the editorial board views the past 3 years\u2019 progress as promising, yet only a step toward doubling the current 2.87 impact factor in the next few years.",

To enhance this form of communication, we have used promotional and other techniques to place the journal with an increasing number of general/ internal medicine physicians. However, journals that desire wide influence over medical care and policy must look to supplemental forms of dissemination of their print communication. This acknowledgment led the Proceedings to begin restructuring its Web site, www.mayo.edu/proceedings, in 2000. To date, readers\u2019 responses have been aweinspiring. From 1999 to the end of 2003, the journal experienced a 200-fold increase in Web site visits. As visits have increased, the journal has learned of new changes that we must make to better serve our readers. Hence, in mid-2004, Proceedings readers will have access to increased journal content, concomitant with mailing of the print journal at the beginning of each month. Once inside the Web site, readers will experience content that is richer, and more \u201csearchable,\u201d than in the past. To make this change possible, it will be necessary for users to register, using a password, for access to material released to the Web site during the initial 6 months after print journal publication. Thereafter, the journal will release its content in an unrestricted fashion to the public, as has occurred in the past. Although there are numerous reasons for these changes, the principal one is to better serve the short-term needs of our subscribers without undermining the stability of the print journal. Readers who have traditionally followed the journal through institutional library subscriptions will continue to be able to do so, with the added benefit of immediate access to all journal content through their library's Web site subscription.",

For example, recent issues have contained articles on new disease entities,4, 5 the genetic bases of diseases,6, 7 and background information regarding real or potential epidemics.8, 9, 10, 11 To address such topics, the Proceedings has used traditional sections of the journal and introduced new ones. Encouraged by the reception of Concise Review articles on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)9 and West Nile virus,11 we will continue using this portion of the journal to inform readers of evolving medical issues of great public health importance. In 2003, we introduced a Brief Communication section,5, 12 to be used as needed to inform readers of preliminary data on new and evolving issues. Changes in the journal's publishing philosophy are perhaps seen no more clearly than in the Primer on Medical Genomics series13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 that was initiated in 2002 and will continue through the first half of 2004. Response to the series has been tremendous. On its completion in mid-2004, the articles will be collated into a book available for purchase from our office or Web site. Encouraged by the fact that advance orders for these books have already been of an unprecedented magnitude, the Proceedings will follow the Primer on Medical Genomics series with a new series entitled Genetic Test Indications and Interpretations in Clinical Practice.",

These efforts were supplemented with focus group research, conducted around the country, to identify changes appealing to readers. Although many of these changes have already been made without fanfare, additional recent study has determined that the journal is due for a more extensive redesign. The desired changes have been agreed upon and will be introduced in mid-2004, after completion of the Primer on Medical Genomics and Symposium on Geriatrics series and immediately before the launch of the previously mentioned series on genetic testing and the new Symposium on Cerebrovascular Diseases. The extent of the alterations, if modest in scope, was tempered by test marketing of proposed changes, during which actual Proceedings readers surprised the staff and editorial board when they informed us that, to paraphrase, \u201cMayo Clinic Proceedings is a dear friend for whom we have developed specific reading patterns over the years.

            "text": "\nMayo Clinic Proceedings has made many changes, based on the concept that a large-circulation journal supported by an institution of the size and reputation of Mayo Clinic should use its resources to meaningfully influence the present and future of medicine. The editorial board and staff have exerted considerable energy to recruit an ever-increasing number of manuscripts from an increasingly diverse group of authors. With the goal of keeping the size of the journal relatively constant, the editorial board has applied increasingly stringent criteria for accepting material for publication. The end result is a manageable amount of material for our readers to review each month, material highly relevant to their practice and way of life. Although the journal is ever-mindful of both its focus on readers engaged in the practice of general/internal medicine and its historical and organizational ties to Mayo Clinic, the journal is nevertheless extremely proud that published manuscripts are originating from an increasingly diverse group of authors in terms of specialty disciplines (eg, epidemiologists, pathologists, basic scientists, ethicists), geography, and institutional affiliation. For example, in 1998, half of the submissions to the journal originated from authors not affiliated with Mayo Clinic, but only 26% of the manuscripts actually published came from \u201coutside\u201d the institution. In 2003, with the fraction of extramural submissions increasing only slightly from 1998 figures, the number of extramurally authored manuscripts published in the Proceedings increased to 38%. Clearly, the diversity of views now seen in the pages of the Proceedings is consistent with the altruistic, humanitarian heritage of Mayo Clinic, perhaps best expressed by Mayo Clinic's \u201cprimary value\u201d that \u201cthe needs of the patient come first.\u201d26\n",
