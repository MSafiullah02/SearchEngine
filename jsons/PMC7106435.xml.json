Community acquired pneumonia,6 hospital-acquired pneumonia, and ventilator associated pneumonia 7 all continue to present clinically significant diagnostic and management challenges. Additionally, the worldwide spread of multidrug resistant tuberculosis8 and emergence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria,9, 10 for which few effective therapy options exist, are a major concern. Respiratory tract infections are also the most common infections in an ever increasing number of immunocompromised people11 in whom a broader differential diagnosis of opportunistic microorganisms presents further diagnostic challenges.12 Successful treatment outcomes for respiratory tract infections presenting in all types of health-care settings will only be achieved with rapid, sensitive, and specific identification of pathogens and antibiotic resistance profiles to allow effective evidence-based antimicrobial therapy and pathogen-specific infection control measures.13\n",

The clinical dilemma surrounding the use of high sensitivity and specificity NAATs is that identification of pathogen nucleic acid from a respiratory tract sample may not necessarily attribute causation.\u2022Few validated NAAT tests that screen for respiratory tract infections caused by specific viral or bacterial groups are being used by diagnostic laboratories to diagnose selected pathogens, usually in combination with more traditional methods.\u2022Laboratories in most developing countries use traditional age-old methods for diagnosis of respiratory tract infections except for the Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay, which is being rolled out worldwide for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance.\u2022Microarray-based multiplexing and nucleic-acid-based deep-sequencing methods for the simultaneous detection of pathogen nucleic acid and multiple antibiotic resistance provide further hope for revolutionising rapid point-of-care tuberculosis diagnostics, and they have been invaluable in identifying new viral and bacterial pathogens.\u2022Despite advances, a great need for rapid, point-of-care pathogen-specific, sensitive, and affordable diagnostics remains for the advancement of clinical management, infection control, and improved public health response to emerging pathogens.\n\n",

This response has many components: rapid diagnosis and identification of similar cases; case control studies to determine reservoirs, modes of transmission, and risk factors; collection of individual and case cluster data and reports; ascertainment of transmission patterns; isolation, identification, and characterisation of the specific pathogen, and establishment of Koch's postulates if possible; and development of pathogen-specific diagnostics and genome sequencing to monitor the evolution and transmission patterns. These collaborative activities are essential for the identification of the specific microorganism, guidance of appropriate targeted therapy, monitoring of response to treatment, prediction of prognosis, guidance of infection control measures, and public health surveillance and control recommendations. Rapid, accurate diagnostic laboratory tests are crucial in the public health management of respiratory tract infections caused by new potentially lethal pathogens.",

Typically, these are on automated or semiautomated systems or kits that integrate sample preparation, pathogen detection, and identification of antimicrobial resistance genes, providing an automated read-out of results. These tests and platforms are the most advanced systems requiring the least possible user input throughout the process and are capable of detecting several pathogens simultaneously. Depending on the test, single or multiple pathogens, or antimicrobial resistances may be detected. Such systems can offer not only an improved speed of diagnosis but also increased sensitivity of detection. However, the development of such tests and their successful implementation into clinical practice requires further development.31, 32, 33\n",

From this point, the basic requirements of a method may diverge: for field studies, the adopted amplification technology may need to be something more suited to situations where power supply cannot be guaranteed, such as isothermal amplification.

Further refinement of bacterial and viral culture methods improved the ability to detect specific pathogens and identify their susceptibility testing against specific antimicrobials, although the time needed for culture growth (24\u201372 h) did not influence treatment decisions on admission. These diagnostic methods did not change until the late 1980s when major advances in molecular biology, immunology, genomics, and technical engineering led to many new diagnostic tests. Serological tests for detection of microbial antigen or antibody, agglutination tests, complement fixation tests, fluorescent antibody tests, radioimmunoassay, and ELISA have been developed for various pathogens without any great influence on clinical management of respiratory tract infections at points of care.38 The most relevant development has been the use of nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) for respiratory tract infection diagnostics.39 The presence of microbial nucleic acids in respiratory tract samples (sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage) has been exploited for amplification of microbe-specific genetic targets.26, 27 This was initially labour intensive and NAAT technologies have evolved to real time PCR (rtPCR), loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and strand displacement amplification, the latter three methods avoiding thermocycling.",

Monoclonal-antibody direct fluorescent antibody tests usually had adequate specificity for a particular virus, but there was a trade-off between turnaround time and sensitivity. Thus, although some of the colorimetric tests for direct antigen detection had a turnaround time of less than an hour, sensitivity could be around 70%.51 Further developments in reaction chemistry have enabled the targeted amplification of other viruses in the same reaction, while keeping sensitivity and specificity high and the turnaround time still relevant to clinical need. Available versions of in-house and commercially developed multiplex tests offer potential amplification of up to 20 pathogens from a clinical sample,26, 40, 45 although for some of these the turnaround time approaches a whole working day. Several head-to-head comparisons of in-house and commercial tests have been published.43, 44, 46, 47, 48\n",

Detection of a weak signal of one virus may represent a commensal or the tail-end of a previous infection, although it may also show that the infection is recent and evolving. Another possibility is that the weaker signal is a pronounced viral infection in the lower respiratory tract, but the virus is not yet well represented in the upper respiratory tract, where there is a different viral infection present. The issue of which clinical sample will generate the highest diagnostic yield is also dependent on the pathogenesis of the virus.",

Barcoding technology,75 which labels each sample with a unique identifier, can be used to simultaneously sequence multiple samples from patients infected with the same pathogen. Several developments are needed before use of NGS becomes more widespread, such as improving the sensitivity of pathogen sequencing directly from clinical material and development of tractable software for practical use.72 Methods that can obviate the necessity for prior culture or PCR amplification for enriching target pathogens are needed. A European funded consortium, PATHSEEK, is investigating high multiplicity multiplexing and multiplexing of many different pathogens in the same reaction,76 using NGS methods with bespoke software for sequencing of whole pathogen genome, including influenza and tuberculosis, directly from clinical material.73 Alternative approaches retain the unbiased nature of NGS, opting instead for unselective deep sequencing of RNA transcripts isolated from clinical material, thereby capturing RNA and DNA pathogens and discovering new agents. The advent of nanotechnologies such as nanopore sequencing and mobile devices promising rapid turnaround times, small footprints, and decreased costs brings us closer to the possibility that near-patient pathogen genome sequencing and data interpretation will be available within the near future.",

Although many different NGS methodologies are now available, the principles\u2014namely, unbiased sequencing of populations (libraries) of amplified DNA-template molecules is common to most pathogens. Advances of next generation methods include PacBio and Nanopore, which can sequence from single molecules to provide read lengths of thousands of bases long and throughput with higher overall error rates. NGS methods can be harnessed for sequencing multiple different pathogens in a single sample or multiple samples in the same run.70 The challenge for the identification of antimicrobial resistance, particularly in complex multi drug resistant organisms, will be to rapidly assemble and analyse the generated data. This will require the construction of robust databases and data analysis algorithms77 that can rapidly equate a genome with a likely antimicrobial resistance profile.",

A cell-free protein microarray was developed that uses the correctly folded and glycosylated S1 fragment of the MERS-CoV S protein as an antigen. MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-S protein-pseudotyped viruses were used in neutralisation assays. Comparison of conventional virus neutralisation test with the S pseudotyped lentivirus-based neutralisation test on 1343 human serum samples collected from healthy donors in Egypt and Hong Kong as controls were negative in both neutralisation test formats.102 Large-scale serological and case-controlled studies of the population in affected countries are urgently needed to further examine spread, prevalence, and transmission of MERS-CoV.",

In 2012, of an estimated 450 000 cases of multidrug resistant tuberculosis worldwide, 80% were undiagnosed.108 Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis present with respiratory symptoms and receive repeated courses of antibiotics before being screened for tuberculosis. The continued use of century-old sputum microscopy and the time required for traditional culture-based diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, coupled with the large global health burden and associated mortality of tuberculosis, led to focused global efforts on new rapid and more sensitive tuberculosis diagnostics (table 5\n). The past 5 years have seen an unprecedented activity in development of a range of new diagnostic tests based on culture, molecular, and non-molecular methods by scores of small-to-medium sized enterprises.109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138 A major concern is that not all marketed tests have been assessed rigorously for diagnostic accuracy, robustness under operational conditions in the field, cost-effectiveness, and practical usefulness.",

The Xpert MTB/RIF assay, which uses the Cepheid GeneXpert system, has been a forerunner in rapid molecular point-of-care diagnostics.115, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137 The results of sputum analysis are available in 2 h, and operationally within 24 h.136, 137 Numerous assessment studies at several points of care have shown that the assay is sensitive and specific and has increased detection of smear-negative patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (table 4).115, 137 However, this diagnostic improvement does not always lead to better clinical outcomes. In a randomised multicentre trial of clinical outcomes of with Xpert MTB/RIF assay, although a high proportion of patients started treatment on the day of presentation, there was no significant improvement in lowering of tuberculosis related morbidity; the researchers suggested that the lack of benefit was a result of effective empirical management in the control group.134 Other promising test platforms are being introduced for detection of M tuberculosis aligning improved functionality at point of care, increased accuracy of detection, and developing more drug resistance targets.109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116 Although tuberculosis-centric diagnostic test development is important, it is prudent to realise that it might not fit into the longer term goals of optimum converging delivery of health care for both noncommunicable and other communicable diseases, which is moving away from disease-specific silos.",

Direct sequencing from sputum requires prior pathogen enrichment by culture or other enrichment methods. Microarray-based multiplexing and nucleic-acid-based deep sequencing methods, for the simultaneous detection of M tuberculosis DNA and multiple drug resistance to several first-line and second-line tuberculosis drugs, now provide further hope in revolutionising rapid-point-of-care tuberculosis diagnostics. Next generation benchtop sequencing systems have the potential to allow for M tuberculosis sequencing for resistances to all first-line and second-line tuberculosis drugs direct from sputum76 and could overcome the problem of low bacterial loads in sputum and provide a timescale weeks quicker than culture-based resistance testing. There is also a need for comprehensive mapping of antimicrobial resistance mutations and bespoke software for easy interpretation of resistance assays. WGS approaches linked with quantitative bacteriology will generate comprehensive genotype\u2013phenotype correlations across all the multidrug resistant M tuberculosis isolates and provide the opportunity to extract genome data exploitable for both development of point-of-care diagnostic tests coupled to drug resistance screening, and for epidemiological and public health control purposes.",

A major challenge of implementation of molecular testing technology will be the ability of the test to distinguish between microbial colonisation, infection, and disease causation. Standard laboratory culture generally incudes a quantitative element, with a usual cut-off being 105 CFU/mL. Respiratory tract specimens are invariably contaminated with colonising organisms from the nasopharynx and the increased sensitivity of molecular techniques will detect such colonisers. Additionally, multiple pathogenic species can be present in one specimen. The extent to which these represent genuine co-infections as opposed to a mixture of infection and colonisation needs to be determined. The difficulty in distinguishing between infection and colonisation creates a dilemma as to whether such results should be used to guide treatment. Incorporation of a quantitative element to diagnostics, such as use of quantitative PCR will go some way towards improved interpretation.",

Batched processing of validated NAAT tests to diagnose some pathogens is usually done in combination with more traditional microbiological methods. In the future, a three-point arrangement for cost-effective rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract infection might be possible. The first point is a low throughput, fully automated NAAT platform, situated as a point-of-care test in primary-care or secondary-care emergency areas, where tests are done by clinical staff, and provide out-of-hours diagnostic information to manage admission of patients and infection control practice. The second stage is a robust in-house or commercial NAAT test of large batch size to provide the main diagnostic laboratory capacity for managing the significant and varied range of targeted respiratory tract infection requests that are generated within a secondary care setting. The third point, which is not yet well established as a diagnostic pathway, is a pathogen-discovery process formed by an initial non-targeted amplification of polyadenylated RNA in a clinical sample, then an array-based selection of potential pathogens. The sequencing of any captured structures might have a much longer turnaround time, but would provide a final opportunity to obtain a diagnosis where no result could be obtained via the first or second point. This three-point diagnostic process would provide the maximum opportunity for obtaining relevant diagnostic information.",

The use of automation and reliability improvements will facilitate testing out of the laboratory and toward the interface between patients and clinicians at points of care and ideally, in rural areas in developing countries, run on solar power.",
