            "text": "People with infections or inflammation can exhibit profound changes in behaviour. Initially, this was thought to be a psychological response to feeling unwell, but more recently the cytokines released as part of the inflammatory response have been implicated. \u201cCytokine associated sickness behaviour\u201d is the term used for this collection of symptoms such as malaise, lethargy, anorexia, hyposomnia, inactivity, impaired cognitive function and anhedonia [1], [2]. This theory is supported by the fact that the syndrome can be reproduced by infusion of either recombinant cytokines, or molecules that induce cytokine synthesis (e.g., lipopolysaccharide) [3], [4], [5]. Agents which antagonise cytokines abolish the syndrome [2]. In animal models, the cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a central role, but IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) are also involved.",

            "text": "Inflammatory responses may also be relevant to depression. It has been known for several years that major depression is frequently associated with activation of the inflammatory response system, involving increased production of IL-1, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 [6], although the evidence relating subclinical depressive symptoms with inflammatory responses is equivocal [7], [8]. Proinflammatory cytokines affect the brain's metabolism of 5 hxdroxy tryptophan (5-HT) by either directly or indirectly stimulating the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase leading to a peripheral depletion of 5-HT providing a possible intermediate in the link between inflammation and depressive symptoms [9]. These inflammatory responses may not be epiphenomena, but actively contribute to depressive symptoms and negative mood states. This has been documented most consistently in studies of mood responses following cytokine-based treatments for cancer. Immunotherapy with IL-2 or interferon \u03b1 causes sadness, loss of interest and other depressive symptoms, and responses correlate with the magnitude of responses of endogenous cytokines [10], [11]. Depressive symptoms have also been reported following interferon \u03b1 treatment of hepatitis C [12]. These effects are rapid, and may be mediated by the effects of cytokines on the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenocortical (HPA) axis [13]. There is also evidence that antidepressants have antiinflammatory effects [14]. Taken together, these findings raise the intriguing possibility that depressive symptoms in as disparate illnesses as coronary heart disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis may be due in part to cytokine activation.",

[15] assessed the effects on mood and cognitive function of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin injection in volunteers. Rapid increases of 50- to 100-fold in IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 occurred within 1\u20134 h of administration in endotoxin but not placebo-injected groups. Increases in anxiety and depressed mood were reported over the same time-scale in the endotoxin group, and the changes were correlated with the magnitude of cytokine responses. However, a problem with this model is that endotoxin administration leads to fever and malaise. A larger increase in body temperature was recorded by Reichenberg et al. [15] in the endotoxin than placebo groups and although no symptoms of sickness were reported, appetite was substantially inhibited. Many participants report flu-like symptoms in response to endotoxin. This makes it difficult to know whether behavioural changes were due to the inflammatory challenge or mild illness induced by the endotoxin itself.",

            "text": "In the present study, we used a milder model of experimental inflammation, involving standard typhoid (Salmonella typhi) vaccination. This method has been used by Vallance et al. to induce inflammatory responses that have been studied in relation to atherogenesis [16]. Increases of four- to sixfold in IL-6 occur, together with IL-1Ra increases of averaging 30-fold after 3 h [17]. Importantly, body temperature is not affected, and participants do not report any sickness or malaise. The use of vaccine rather than endotoxin may afford a better insight into the changes in mood in response to immune challenge in human healthy volunteers. The first aim of this study was therefore to examine the effects of typhoid vaccination on the subsequent mood of healthy volunteers in a placebo-controlled double blind trial. Based on the evidence linking proinflammatory cytokine release with negative moods, we hypothesised that typhoid vaccination would induce a negative mood response. Since moods are not constant over the day, changes in mood following vaccination cannot be definitively ascribed to the effects of an intervention in the absence of a comparison group. Half the participants were therefore injected with placebo, and the mood changes in this group taken as the reference against which the active vaccination group could be compared. In the light of the kinetics of proinflammatory cytokine responses observed in earlier studies, we hypothesised that compared with placebo, vaccination would induce transient negative moods in the 1\u20134 h following treatment, in the absence of rises in systemic body temperature or symptoms of illness.",

Plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines vary with acute stress and with chronic stressors such as care-giving and work strain, and increase with acute stress [19], [20], [21], [22]. In a study of experimentally induced upper respiratory infection, background stress was found to correlate positively with IL-6 responses to infection [23]. It is conceivable that chronic stress might influence cytokine responses to vaccination, and thereby moderate mood responses. The supplementary aim of this study was therefore to assess associations between chronic stress and mood responses to typhoid vaccination. There are many aspects of chronic stress that could potentially be investigated, but in the interests of brevity and appropriateness for the population we limited measurement to two commonly assessed variables\u2014financial strain and job demands. We hypothesised that background chronic stress would modulate cytokine responses, and thereby associations with mood responses in the vaccination but not placebo conditions.",

It was necessary to test this hypothesis in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion, since researchers' and participants' expectations might have influenced the pattern of results. In addition, mood can change over the day irrespective of stimuli such as vaccination, so the effects of this stimulus were tested against the fluctuations observed in the placebo group. Mood was assessed using a standard measure, and we analysed the total POMS rather than individual scales to provide a global impression of mood change. The results confirmed our expectations about the effects of the inflammatory stimulus. Mood improved over the day in the placebo group, reaching a plateau 2\u20134 h postvaccination (11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.), before deteriorating slightly later in the day. The increase in positive mood from the start of the study may have been due partly to time of day, and partly to the relief at having completed the injection. By contrast, mood did not improve over the day in the vaccination condition. The difference between groups was greatest over the first 3 h following vaccination, with some convergence later in the day. By the end of the study (5:00 p.m.), mood had deteriorated below baseline in the vaccination group, while remaining elevated in the placebo condition. Thus, relative to the placebo condition, the vaccination group had a more negative mood following injection.",

In the present study, there was no change in body temperature, no febrile responses, and symptom reports were low and stable. In addition, the study by Reichenberg et al. [15] was more invasive in nature, involving venous cannulation and continuous temperature measurement through a rectal probe. It is notable that anxiety increased in the placebo as well as endotoxin condition in this earlier study. Our results suggest that vaccination may be a preferable way of studying the relationship between immune challenges, mood and behavioural responses. A previous study of rubella vaccination has shown increases in depressed mood in a proportion of the young women tested who were initially seronegative [30].",

Participants reporting greater financial strain showed larger negative changes in mood in the hour after vaccination. No such association was observed in the placebo group, so it is not a nonspecific response caused by negative affectivity reporting biases. There was also no association with the second measure of chronic stress, job demands. The explanation may be that job demands were relatively low, while financial strain was high on average in this sample compared with other population samples in which the measures have been used. The association with financial strain needs to be confirmed in a larger study involving cytokine measures, so as to discover whether inflammatory or some other responses to vaccine mediate effects. If the association is confirmed, it could be due to one of two processes; either background stress magnifies inflammatory responses to standard challenges such as vaccination thereby increasing the mood change, or it affects the extent of mood change following a fixed inflammatory response. Individual differences in mood response to rubella vaccination have also been reported, with greater depressed mood in young women of lower socioeconomic status [30]. A number of studies of responses to fixed doses of coronavirus or influenza have shown that the likelihood of infection is affected by psychosocial factors such as life stress, negative affect, and social isolation [32], [33]. The observation by Cohen et al. [23] that the IL-6 increases following infection with influenza were correlated with psychological stress is consistent with the possibility that the present finding was mediated through individual differences in IL-6 response.",

Inflammation is now thought to be a fundamental factor in the pathophysiology of vascular disease [34]. Acute coronary syndromes are also associated with marked inflammatory responses, with larger increases in IL-1\u03b2 followed by raised IL-6 [35]. The acute increase in IL-1Ra and IL-6 over the first 2 days following hospitalization with unstable angina is associated with adverse clinical outcomes [36]. Depression in the days following admission with acute coronary syndromes has also been shown to predict poor outcome in many studies [37], and several mechanisms to explain the association are being investigated [38]. An additional possibility is that depressed mood is due to inflammation in these patients, and that heightened levels of inflammation underlie the association between depression and adverse cardiac outcomes.",
