Even if 80% of COVID-19 human cases are mild, they can be still distressing and long-lasting. Most common symptoms of the infection are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. About 20% of infected patients may develop severe cases, and a small percentage of them (5%) may become critically ill. Patients with severe cases usually develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome continue to urge people to stay at home and observe social distancing. Italy is experiencing more deaths than China, the country where the infection originated, which now officially reports 4,642 deaths. Since the infection was first identified in Codogno (Lombardy region) on February 21st, in less than three weeks, COVID-19 overloaded the National Health Care System (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN) in the northern Italy. It turned the hard hit Lombardy region into a grim glimpse of what countries may expect if they cannot slow down the spread of the virus and \"flatten the curve\" of new cases, which in turn allows treatment of sick patients without overloading the capacity of hospitals. Italy established draconian measures by restricting movement and closing all stores except for pharmacies, groceries and other social essential services. However, these measures did not come in time to prevent the surge of cases that has deeply taxed the capacity even of a well-regarded health care system. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the species Severe acute respiratory syndromerelated CoVs (SARS-rCoV) within the subgenus Sarbecovirus, genus Betacoronavirus together with SARS-CoV-1 strains from humans and SARS-rCoVs from wild carnivores and horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) [2] .",

            "text": "The virus harbors a linear single-stranded positive RNA genome of nearly 30 kb. At the very 5\u2032-end of the genome is a leader sequence which is the unique characteristic in CoV replication and plays critical roles in the gene expression of CoV during its discontinuous subgenomic replication [6] . Downstream, the 5\u2032-most two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2 genome comprises the replicase gene, which consists of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and 1b translated to produce two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b. Cleavage of the replicase polyproteins is predicted to result in 16 end-products; nsp1-nsp11 encoded in ORF1a and nsp12-16 encoded in ORF1b [7] . Located downstream of ORF1b are four ORFs that code for structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins) and additional ORFs coding for accessory genes. As SARS-CoV-1, the S (through the S1) protein mediates viral attachment to the specific cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) [1] and fusion between the envelope and plasma membrane. As for other CoVs, the S protein is also the main inducer of virus-neutralising antibodies. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a functional polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary through the insertion of 12 nucleotides, which additionally lead to the predicted acquisition of three O-linked glycans around the site [8] . Six residues of the receptor binding domain (RBD) have been shown to be critical for binding to ACE2 receptors and for determining the host range of SARS-CoV-1 like viruses. Based on structural studies and biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that binds with high affinity to ACE2 also from ferrets and cats [9] .",

All obtained sequences in this study showed > 99% of nucleotide (nt) identity with Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512) SARS-CoV-2 reference strain. However, all of them had single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with respect the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence. All sequences either partial or complete, show a first common SNP mutation in the leader sequence (241C > T) which co-evolved with 3037C > T, 14408C > T, and 23403A > G [16] . While 3037C > T causes a synonymous mutations in nsp3 (F105F) 14408C > T and 23403A > G cause amino acid mutations in RNA primase (nsp 12, P323L), and S protein (D614G), respectively. The four co-mutations are prevalent in viral isolates from Europe. All sequences obtained in this study, but one, had 27046C (T175 in the coded M protein); one sequence from Pescara, which was not deposited with GISAID, had the mutation 27046C > T (T175M in the M protein). Moreover, 29/45 (12/ 16 of those which have been deposited) sequences showed R203K and G204R in the N protein as for the presence of mutations 28881G > A, 28882G > A, and 28883G > C in the nucleotide sequence. For 3/45 of sequences, the obtained sequence reads did not cover that portion of genome. According to GISAID (Genomic epidemiology of hCoV, https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19-app/), these mutations in the N protein first appeared in a SARS-CoV-2 sequence from northern Europe (hCoV-19/Netherlands/Berlicum_1363564/ 2020, EPI_ISL_413565) originating from a sample collected on February 24 th with a travel history to Italy Regarding Italian sequences, the same mutations were also identified in one sequence recently released from the Laboratory of Virology Lazzaro Spallanzani (Rome) and collected on February 28 th from a male patient aged 41 years. Interestingly, a sequence obtained from a sample collected from the hospital of Atri (TE7097), which was not deposited with GISAID as for suboptimal horizontal coverage, did not show D614G in the S protein, typical of European strains, thus retaining the D614 of early Chinese strains. Unfortunately, we could not investigate for the presence of D614G comutations and residues in position 203 and 204 of the N protein as for the absence of sequence coverage in those portions of the genome. No mutations were observed in critical residues of the S1 protein.",

In this regard, it would be important to obtain the sequence information of the early SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in Abruzzo and northern Italian regions to draw evidenced-based conclusions. The N protein of SARS-CoV-1 is responsible for the formation of the helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly. The N protein may cause an immune response and has potential value in vaccine development [17] . Hence, these mutations shall be considered when developing a vaccine using the N protein.

            "text": "Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is currently performed in Italy and so in Abruzzo region, in a One Health perspective, with the support of the network of the IZSs. This decision arose by the combination of various relevant factors. Firstly, the IZSs belong to the SSN, coordinated by the MoH, and such condition facilitates the establishment of fruitful collaborations with the Public Health sectors, including the development of common diagnostic and data exchange protocols. Secondly, each IZS has the technical and scientific capacities to support the SSN to meet the extraordinary surge in demand for diagnostic testing of human samples for SARS-CoV-2. Lastly, IZSs have also experience in quality assurance, biosafety, biosecurity, and high throughput testing for the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in animals, some of which, including the current SARS-CoV-2, are zoonotic. Moreover, they are also equipped with large infrastructure for genomic analysis and storage of sequence data. These infrastructures are routinely used in animal health and food security emergences and for diagnostic purposes. In this regard, the analysis of the whole viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 strains is a critical task. However, still scarce is genomic data (and related metadata) available from SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Italy and further efforts are necessarily warranted. Whole genome sequencing straight from infected biological samples may indeed provide useful information to identify mutations during the virus adaptation to humans, such as mutations in critical residues of the S protein or resulting in the loss of accessory genes as already described for SARS-CoV-1 [18] . An additional factor which may have influenced the choice of appointing IZSs to support the SSN's effort against COVID-19 was related to the biological nature of the occurring agent. CoVs act as primary actors within the so-called human/animal interface across which a plethora of infectious pathogens has been observed to emerge, spill over various species and eventually evolve, thus finding new ecological niches and causing new epidemiological phenomena. Of value, in the Italian context, is certainly the experience that veterinarians operating within the Public Health system gained in the control and characterization of previous health issues of livestock and poultry including avian flu, bluetongue, foot and mouth disease, and BSE, which were responsible for huge economic losses. This aptitude of being \"ready to action\" during a health emergence certainly includes rapid diagnosis, epidemiological investigations, molecular/antigenic characterization, development of vaccines, and planning of surveillance programs, a process that is pursued, together with saving patients' lives in hospitals, by technicians and scientists around the globe for COVID-19. We add to this the fact that veterinarians have known of CoVs and related diseases for decades [5, 19] , thus, the One Health concept is central and should again be sublimated and adopted to control critical health emergencies, including that of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the multidisciplinary involvement of different professionals operating within the SSN is crucial to properly and effectively face the challenges posed by viruses like SARS-CoV-2. A holistic and One Health approach is the sole solution for better understanding the epidemiological aspect of this disease and possibly preventing the establishment of new transmission chains. Currently, the available genome sequences so far clearly reveal that the most closely related virus (96.2% of nt sequence identity) to SARS-CoV-2 is a strain from a bat, Rhinolophus affinis, identified as strain BatCoVRaTG13 from a faecal sample in Yunnan province, China; and that the next closest viruses are SARS-rCoVs identified from pangolins [23] , however, the exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be demonstrated. In this perspective, veterinary virologists may surely support this important task as well as those doomed to understand SARS-CoV-2 virulence factors through the assessment of reverse genetics studies and animal models, and to analyze the impact of the hyperinflammation observed in COVID-19 infected patients, characterized by a cytokine storm. This latter evidence is not novel for veterinarians as it is observed in cats infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus, a lethal pathotype of the feline enteric coronavirus [20] .",

Although the role of domestic animals in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be negligible, further studies are reasonably warranted. Moreover, to plan future strategies for SARS-CoV-2 containment, it will be essential to better understand the protective role of the various classes of antibodies against the virus, as well as the prevalence of serologically positive individuals in the human population when the epidemic curve has shown a stable decrease. Also for these purposes, the IZSs' laboratories will be useful for processing a large number of serum samples and to support the Public Health Institutes in the necessary experimental studies.",
