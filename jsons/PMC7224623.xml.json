Frequent, structured communication in the form of huddles plays an integral role in mitigating this risk. A recent article described the value of bringing together stakeholders to plan safe patient transport and the process of getting the patient onto the operating room table.9 Huddles should include surgeons, the anesthesia team, intensive care unit (ICU) attendings and nurses, respiratory therapists, operating room (OR) nursing staff, environmental services, security, and members of infection control. To standardize this process, hospitals have developed transport protocols for the operative team10,11 and are performing transport simulations to prepare for high numbers of potential patients. Open communication between the surgical team and peri-operative staff allows the group to transfer high-risk patients from wards to the OR and back with reduced risk to the team.",

Currently, we are not aware of any data to suggest that either the N95 or PAPR are better to protect against COVID-19. PAPRs are generally used when HCWs cannot achieve a proper fit with an N95; guidelines and mask specifications suggest equivalence for aerosolized agents.14 A surgical mask is capable of blocking gross inhalation of droplets, while a well-fitted N95 respirator is additionally capable of filtering aerosols. This is of particular interest to surgeons as aerosols have been identified from multiple surgical procedures, including those that use electrocautery and high-speed tools,15,16 and smoke from electrocautery has been shown to harbor intact bacterial and virus particles.7,8,17\u201319 As such, surgery can be considered an \u201caerosol generating procedure\u201d (AGP),20 especially with the use of electrocautery and/or laparoscopy.",

Proper gowning and doffing procedures should be reviewed with surgeons, residents, and OR staff before each case to ensure proper technique.32,33 In addition, based on previous viral outbreaks, a \u201cbuddy system\u201d has been recommended, in which providers assist with and oversee the doffing of a colleague.34 In our experience, the combined use of video-based instruction and a colleague's oversight significantly improves anxiety among staff and may lead to less self-contamination during PPE removal.",
