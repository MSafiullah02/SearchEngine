The common cold is generally not life threatening and usually resolves without medical intervention. As it is caused by a group of highly contagious airborne viruses for which no vaccine is available, the best protection is to avoid close proximity to individuals who are infected. By contrast, influenza results in many fatalities, particularly in the elderly and in individuals with suppressed immune systems. Annually modified influenza vaccines available in the western world were initially offered to individuals at risk but are now available to everyone. However, it should be noted that (87) 'The influenza vaccine was only 62% effective among people who did not receive influenza vaccination in the prior year. In comparison, vaccine effectiveness among those who did get influenza vaccination in the previous year was substantially lower.' Occasionally, a new influenza variant may cause a pandemic as a result of zoonosis (i.e. transmission of an animal flu virus to humans) or 'genetic recombination' (more precisely, reassortment of gene segments) of a human virus with a nonhuman form that crosses species. Well-known recent examples of these are swine flu and avian or bird flu, which is sometimes confused with the zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (a corona virus). Worldwide policies to reduce or eliminate the risk of epidemics have had some success, and several infectious diseases have been largely eradicated or are under control in the western world as a result of national vaccination programs. The most successful example of a human-driven eradication is that of the smallpox virus following implementation of a worldwide vaccination strategy. This approach succeeded because the smallpox virus (variola) is essentially comprised of a single strain and does not have an animal vector. The approach to measles is another example demonstrating the success of vaccines. Measles is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory system that spreads through aerosol transmission or contact with nasal and oral fluids. Effective vaccines are available and in the USA measles was declared eliminated in 2000. In 2010, at the 63rd World Health Assembly, a global goal was proposed to eliminate the disease with a target of a 95% reduction in mortality by 2015. Unfortunately, there has been a recent measles outbreak in the USA (288 cases), mostly in unvaccinated individuals (www.CDC.gov/measles/).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 693, "end": 697, "text": "(87)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "As a result of new vaccines and vaccination policies, and also improved medical care and development of novel drugs, worldwide infectious disease fatalities have not increased in the past two decades.

The global approach to eradicate polio is another example, with currently up to 80% of the world's population living in polio-free regions and a 'collaborative strategic endgame plan' in place to eradicate the last reservoirs of polio (the Global Polio Eradication Initiative). The list of viral infections and viral diseases is extensive and the eradication of one pathogen may provide a niche for another pathogen to become more virulent.

Initially, the viral nucleic acid is isolated from the oral fluid sample directly or after centrifugation performed to concentrate cell-associated virus.

For HIV viral-load analysis, a frequently used commercial assay, based on viral nucleic acid amplification, is the COBAS \u00e2 Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and an example of a commercial assay based on signal amplification is the VERSANT \u00e2 HIV-1 RNA Assay (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral infections detectable using oral fluid samples"}, {"text": "Viral nucleic acid-based methods are more sensitive and considered less contagious because pathogens in the sample are inactivated during the initial viral nucleic acid isolation protocol.

Ultimately, a cultivation confirmatory test may be needed to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Detection of viral antigens by indirect fluorescent antibody labeling or electron microscopic techniques can be used to detect the presence of intact viral particles. Note that the presence of microscopically intact viral particles in a specific biological fluid/matrix cannot distinguish viable/infectious virus from noninfectious virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral infections detectable using oral fluid samples"}, {"text": "A list of examples of viable viruses detectable in oral fluid samples is provided in Table 1 . In contrast to serum or plasma, there is no standard protocol for saliva/oral fluid collection and thus saliva may refer to whole-mouth stimulated or unstimulated saliva or to a sample obtained with an oral swab or brush. Filtered or centrifuged saliva can be used to detect free virus, but the virus may be free or cell-bound when using whole saliva or oral swabs. Not all viruses are easily cultivated, and in contrast to bacteria they cannot be directly grown in culture media, but require specific living cells to support their replication. Human papillomavirus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 8, coronaviruses and the rhinoviruses are examples of viruses known to be difficult to culture. Determining the presence of viable virus in oral fluid samples does not always indicate that the virus can be transmitted orally. In the case of cytomegalovirus, a member of the Herpesviridae family, it is known that transmission occurs via direct contact with body fluids. Although serology suggests a prevalence of cytomegalovirus of up to 80%, blood donors are not routinely tested for active cytomegalovirus infections because the virus in blood is cell associated and leucocyte-depleted red-bloodcell products are considered cytomegalovirus safe. However, the situation in saliva is probably different.

Other antigen assays demonstrating active viral infections using oral samples have been described for ebola (44) , rabies (72) and HIV (62, 86) . Pathogenderived antigens (e.g. p24 for HIV) are often present at higher levels than the viral genome, and identifying such abundant viral proteins (>1,000 copies per Nucleic acid amplification is compatible with the simultaneous screening or detection of multiple pathogens in a single sample using multiple pairs of DNA primers specific for the targeted microorganisms. The development of fully integrated rapid test devices, capable of analyzing clinical samples for a panel of specific pathogen targets, would be of great value for point-of-care use. Such devices are feasible with the currently available viral nucleic acid-amplification technology; however, cost and sample-preparation issues still need to be addressed (45, 71) . Recent technological advances have allowed analysis by deep sequencing of the human salivary microbiome to create a catalog of all the microorganisms present in saliva and oral mucosa. Analysis of the salivary virome (94) , the virus subset of the salivary microbiome, demonstrated that the majority of oral viruses are bacteriophages. It is postulated that because these phages require bacterial cells for replication they probably play an important role in the microbial diversity and health of the oral cavity and may also influence the susceptibility to human viral infections.

However, a four-fold increase in antibody titer during convalescence may aid in the identification of a particular pathogen but requires an accurate quantitative antibody assay, whereas the existing rapid antibody assays are qualitative, providing a yes/no answer. In contrast, an HIV antibody test can be used to establish HIV-positive status because the infection is not self-cleared and there is no cure or vaccination currently available; therefore, the presence of anti-HIV immunoglobulins can be used as a screening test. However, antibody presence does not correlate with viral load or the ability to transmit the disease; HIV-infected patients on antiviral therapy are antibody positive but may have a viral load below the level of detection. An FDA-approved saliva antibody test is available over-the-counter for home testing (63) . A concern regarding this test is that individuals with suspected exposure to HIV may use it too early postexposure and, as a result, receive a false-negative test result because it takes 6 weeks or longer to mount an antibody response, a time period referred to as the seroconversion window. This situation poses a potential risk as newly infected individuals in the period before seroconversion have extremely high viral loads and are thus highly contagious. There are reports indicating that saliva-based testing has a lower clinical sensitivity than blood-based testing, which may be the case if including HIV-infected individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for an extended period (84) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 887, "end": 891, "text": "(63)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1610, "text": "(84)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Saliva and viral infections"}, {"text": "In this review, we summarize our unpublished results from two studies demonstrating that the level of antibodies in saliva differ from the level in blood.

More elaborate laboratory-based testing (e.g. full analysis of blood) is necessary to provide quantitative results because a rapid antibody test only provides a qualitative result. Saliva is preferred as a sample over blood because of higher patient acceptance, issues of safety (no chance of injury caused by needles) and cost (e.g. requirement for a phlebotomist), and is compatible with self-testing. Eventually, oral samples may provide an ideal matrix for diagnosing many other viral infections. Currently, only two oral-based commercial tests for infectious disease are FDA approved for use in the USA: the OraQuick oral HIV test; and the OraRisk human papillomavirus salivary diagnostic test. The OraQuick test (OraSure Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) is an FDA-approved CLIA waved test using an oral swab specimen. The OraRisk human papillomavirus test (OralDNA labs; Access Genetics, LLC), also FDA approved, utilizes an oral fluid sample sent to a central laboratory for nucleic acid analysis.

Antibody screening is useful for epidemiological studies and for monitoring a large population for immunity to common viral infections, whereas the screening of young children for the presence of antibodies against infectious agents thought to be eliminated can be useful to monitor potential re-emergence of a pathogen. Using saliva as a clinical sample for this (large-scale) approach is cost-effective because samples can be collected noninvasively by the participants themselves at home and mailed to a national test laboratory (81, 85) . It is widely accepted that any antibody detectable in blood can also be detected in saliva. However, there are fluctuations and differences in concentration because salivary flow rates vary with circadian rhythm and saliva composition is more variable than that of blood/plasma. Moreover, the antibody isotype differs; salivary glands produce and secrete salivary IgA, whereas IgG and IgM enter the oral cavity through leakage from the bloodstream and gingival crevicular fluid and are present at lower concentrations. Another issue in studies utilizing oral samples is the method of collection; for example, with respect to antibody type, the composition of whole saliva is quite different from the composition of gingival crevicular fluid, which is a transudate that more closely resembles blood. For antibody detection, as a consequence of the high abundancy after seroconversion, the collection method is less critical than is the case when targeting pathogen-derived analytes, such as nucleic acids. In previous studies (22, 67) exploring the development of a modular microfluidic test device for multiplex analysis of saliva samples, a versatile generic antibody assay [ Fig. 1 (22, 29, 31, 32) ] was evaluated using two sets of saliva samples collected using different protocols. Set 1 [WIHS, obtained from the Woman's Interagency HIV Study (10) ] comprised samples, which, upon collection, were immediately stored in a preservative, whereas set 2 (UO1, samples collected during a study funded by National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIH grant UO1DE017855) comprised samples, which, upon collection, were clarified using the saliva-collection sponge from the UPlink collector (73) . From both sets, paired serum and saliva samples were tested in parallel to validate saliva results. Figure 2 shows the results obtained with the WIHS (Fig. 2A) and UO1 samples (Fig. 2B) . The assay results are presented as a normalized value, the ratio of the signal measured at the Test line divided by the signal measured at the Flow Control line (27) . Assay cut-off thresholds (the value above which a sample is designated reactive) are determined from the average value obtained with the HIV-negative control samples. The HIV-positive samples uniformly generated a higher assay value than the HIV-negative samples, apparently independently of the saliva-collection protocol.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of infection for individuals involved in high-risk behaviors (www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/prep/). In many cases, HIV infection will initially go unnoticed until an individual has a medical consultation related to a secondary opportunistic infection. Usually at that point the individual is past the HIV seroconversion window and infection can be identified with a rapid antibody screening test. As HIV infection is not curable, it is highly likely that a person with antibodies against HIV is infected, but a confirmatory test to validate the antibody test result is required to exclude a false-positive result. For the patient this waiting period, up to a week or more, to get the final test result can be difficult psychologically. For this reason, point-of-care devices that can be used to diagnose and validate HIV infection within 1 or 2 h are important. If the device is also able to determine an accurate viral load, counseling could be included concomitantly with the immediate start of appropriate antiretroviral therapy. This would also reduce the number of individuals required to return to the clinic to receive their confirmatory test result and may thus decrease transmission of the virus. Fourth-generation immunoassays that detect the p24 antigen and anti-HIV immunoglobulins have been developed but are not readily available for the most point-of-care settings (57, 128) . The combination of nucleic acid and antibody detection is a better option as a result of the availability of nucleic acid-amplification methods that achieve the desired sensitivity (22) and also allow detection of an early infection (before seroconversion). The ultimate (point-of-care) device allows detection of anti-HIV immunoglobulins, viral antigen (e.g. soluble p24), viral RNA, as well as pro-viral DNA (34) . This type of device provides both screening and confirmation of infection within the seroconversion window as the presence of viral RNA could be confirmed either by the presence of viral antigens or by proviral DNA.
