Laboratory results were most notable for lymphopenia, elevated inflammatory markers, a rapid rise in troponin I, and elevated NT-proBNP further elucidated in Table 1 initiation of norepinephrine to support blood pressure with diuresis. Finally, the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab at 4 mg/kg (400mg) was administered as a single infusion. Within 24 hours the patient's oxygenation and hemodynamics improved as evidenced by a P/F ratio of 246, cessation of norepinephrine, and reduction in milrinone. On hospital day 7 an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) currently known as AT-001 was initiated at a dose of 1500 mg every 12 hours for a 14 day course. Over the next three days the patient was weaned off NMB, milrinone, and FiO2/PEEP until extubation on hospital day 10 (total of 7 days of mechanical ventilation), and eventually discharged on hospital day 19.",

Multiple institutions have released guidelines to assist in management. The majority of guidance focuses on the associated respiratory dysfunction, which is derived from abundant existing data on ARDS management. However, less guidance exists regarding cardiac complications from the virus despite its prevalence and poor prognostication related to the disease. A study from China revealed patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection developed cardiac injury in roughly 20% of cases leading to greater than 50% mortality (4). A retrospective analysis for cause of death in Chinese patients infected with COVID-19 revealed 40% of patients died at least in part to myocardial injury and circulatory collapse (5). These organ systems do not operate independently and often compound complications. For instance, those with cardiac injury are over 5-fold more likely to require mechanical ventilation (4).",

Similar to reported averages, the patient exhibited rapid respiratory failure on hospital day 3 and 10 days after symptom onset. Concomitantly, the patient had a significant rapid rise in troponin without ischemic changes on EKG, and global hypokinesis with relative apical sparing on echocardiogram suggestive of myocarditis. Eventually MRI showed diffuse bi-ventricular and bi-atrial edema with mild LGE making myocarditis the most likely etiology to the acute cardiac injury in this context. Other reasonable but less likely etiologies include stress cardiomyopathy (inverted variant/reverse Takotsubo's given apical sparing), ACS, or demand ischemia. In stress cardiomyopathy over 95% of cases exhibit EKG changes, and MRI shows edema without LGE in the areas of regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA). Additionally, reverse Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy makes up less than 5% of cases, further decreasing its likelihood (6) . Given the absence of EKG changes, minimal CAC on chest CT, and RWMA outside of coronary distributions ACS was also improbable. Further investigation with endomyocardial biopsy to confirm the histologic diagnosis of myocarditis was deferred given the risk of the procedure, the critical state of the patient, and the goal to minimize viral exposure to healthcare personnel.",

Additionally, some studies indicate mortality benefit and reduced duration of mechanical intubation in ARDS including observational data from China (8) (9) . When the patient's respiratory and hemodynamic status worsened in the setting of persistently elevated inflammatory markers, an IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab was infused. Tocilizumab has FDA approval for treating inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell arteritis. It also carries an off-label use for treating cytokine release syndrome, which may help attenuate this phase of COVID-19 infection. A Chinese study reported positive outcomes for its use in treating COVID-19 pneumonia and Phase III clinical trials are currently underway in the US (10) . Subsequently, an ARI currently known as AT-001 was initiated aimed at further mitigating pulmonary and cardiac inflammatory sequelae. In the setting of endotoxins, ARI's have shown reduced inflammatory markers, recovery of cardiac function, and mortality benefit in animal models (11) .

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on the 3 rd day of admission revealed moderate diffuse hypokinesis with relative apical sparing and a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 35-40%. Notably, there was no ventricular dilation or pericardial effusion. On hospital day 18 cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a recovery in EF to 82% and diffuse bi-ventricular and bi-atrial edema with a small area of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) shown in Figure 3. Management Initial management consisted of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and possible concomitant bacterial infection. On hospital day 3 the patient developed ARDS requiring elective endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient was also treated for presumed myocarditis with methylprednisolone 500 mg IV daily for 4 days with subsequent prednisone taper, colchicine 0.6 mg every 12 hours, and hemodynamic monitoring with the FloTrac system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) via existing arterial and central venous catheters. The next day a milrinone infusion was started for cardiogenic shock as evidenced by hypotension, a cardiac index of 1.4 L/min/m 2 , and systemic vascular resistance of 3000 dynes/seconds/cm -5 . On hospital day 5 the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F ratio) worsened to 75 meeting criteria for severe ARDS. Changes in management for his ARDS included increasing PEEP from 10 to 17 cmH2O, FiO2 up to 90%, increasing inspiratory/expiratory ratio, and neuromuscular blockade (NMB) with continuous rocuronium infusion. Hemodynamically the patient required a three-fold increase in milrinone infusion and",
