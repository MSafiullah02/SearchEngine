            "text": "Coronavirus (CoV) remains a public health concern 16 years after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV ) in 2003 [1]. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012, reemerged in 2015, and is still circulating in the Middle East region, which reminds the international community that the threat of CoVs persists [2, 3]. However, neither vaccine nor drugs against CoVs are currently available. Outbreaks of CoVs initiated extensive structural investigation on CoV encoded proteins thereafter, which not only shed light on the life cycle of CoVs but also laid foundation for the structure-based drug design (SBDD ). CoV contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome of ~30 kb, one of the largest among +RNA viruses [4, 5]. To maintain the unusually large RNA genome, CoV encodes two replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are broken down into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) via proteinase cleavage [6, 7]. The nsps are then recruited to cytoplasm membranes, on which they form the membrane-associated replication-transcription complex (RTC ). An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12 and a helicase nsp13 are the central components of RTC [8, 9]. However, while high-resolution structures of most CoV encoded proteins had been determined soon after SARS-CoV outbreak, the first CoV nsp13 structure, MERS-CoV nsp13, was only solved recently [10]. Nsp13 belongs to helicase superfamily 1 and shares conserved features with the eukaryotic Upf1 helicase [11, 12]. Nsp13 is a multi-domain protein comprising of an N-terminal Cys/His rich domain (CH domain) and a C-terminal SF1 helicase core [10]. Nsp13 exhibits multiple enzymatic activities, including hydrolysis of NTPs and dNTPs, unwinding of DNA and RNA duplexes with 5\u2032-3\u2032 directionality and the RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity [13, 14]. To investigate the structure of CoV nsp13, we overexpressed the full-length MERS-CoV nsp13 (1-598aa) in insect cells and purified. The activity of the recombinant MERS-CoV nsp13 was verified by ATPase and helicase assays. Crystallization of MERS-CoV nsp13 was achieved by adding a synthetic single-stranded 15 poly dT DNA with 5\u2032-triphosphate (ppp-15 T) to the protein, which restrains the intrinsic flexibility of nsp13. Benefiting from the presence of an N-terminal zinc-binding domain with three zinc atoms, multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data at the zinc absorption edge was collected, which allowed the determination of the crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13 [10].",

Having a water trough in incubator also can reduce the evaporation of the medium.The culture of insect cells sometimes was harassed by the contamination of bacteria or other microbes. To avoid the contamination, we treat the conical flasks not only by conventional autoclave sterilization, but also leave the 3 L conical flask (sealed by tinfoil) in the oven at 200 \u00b0C for 3\u20135 h before using.To remove nucleic acids bound to nsp13, we used the lysis buffer containing high concentrate salt; this is a key step and improves the crystallization of nsp13 [10]. In practice, when sonicated in the buffer containing high concentrate salt, we found that the SUMO-tagged recombinant proteins lead the supernatant of the high-5 cell lysate to be turbid, which finally blocks the affinity columns. We have tried four concentrations of NaCl in lysis buffer, including 300 mM, 500 mM, 1 M, and 1.5 M. The first three concentrations of NaCl render the supernatant to be unable to use, we can\u2019t improve it by high-speed centrifugation (47,850 \u00d7 g), and it also can\u2019t be filtered by 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filter. The last concentration, 1.5 M NaCl in lysis buffer, could generate a bit better supernatant of cell lysates than other three concentrations of salt. We centrifuge the supernatant twice, then can filter it by 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filters (100 mL supernatant consumed about 8\u201310 filters). This clarified supernatant can flow through the affinity columns well.The results of helicase assay always face the contamination of background fluorescence.
