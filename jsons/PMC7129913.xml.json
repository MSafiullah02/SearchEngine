But the use of common disinfectants might result in many by-products with potential genotoxic and/or carcinogenic activity. In a recent study, the micronucleus test in root cells revealed genotoxicity in many samples of water disinfected with sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, or peracetic acid [1]. In our practice in China, peracetic acid is the most commonly used disinfectant on solid surfaces in hospitals and public places. Because peracetic acid is a stronger oxidizing agent than chlorine or chlorine dioxide, it is much more hazardous for exposure to skin, eyes, the digestive system, or the respiratory system. Moreover, the substance is very toxic to aquatic organisms after environmental disposal without any previous treatment. Therefore, alternative disinfectants or disinfectant systems should be developed that are safer to the environment.",

On the day before infection, Vero cells were incubated in 24-well microtitre plates. On the day of infection, the supernatants of cultured infected cells were discarded and the cells were washed once with EMEM without FBS. Mixtures of MB/virus illuminated previously with the narrow bandwidth light system were inoculated into the wells of the microtitre plates containing Vero monolayer cells prepared previously. Every mixture corresponding to a different concentration of MB working solution was inoculated into 10 wells. Inoculums were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with gentle shaking every 10\u201315 min to allow adsorption of virus by Vero cells.

The plaques were counted after staining with crystal violet. The titration of dengue virus was assessed with plaque-forming units, and the inactivation effects on dengue virus of different concentrations of MB solution were evaluated based on the killing log value (KLV).

This method has been widely used in the prevention of transfusion-transmitted diseases in the clinic. Moreover, because pathogens of bacterial, yeast and protozoal classes are also susceptible to phenothiaziniums, the MB/light system has also been used in photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy [7]. Chemical and biological properties of MB have been thoroughly studied [8], [9]. The optical absorption of MB is optimum for the blood banking application, and it is currently being used clinically for photoinactivation of fresh frozen plasma in Europe [8]. MB/light-treatment has proved to be the most suitable method of virus inactivation since it provides an acceptable compromise between viral safety and impaired materials (e.g., plasma) quality. MB can bind to and enter via the virus membrane, whereupon it intercalates with nucleic acids. Upon illumination, it then absorbs visible light energy and becomes activated with generation of highly reactive oxygen species (e.g., singlet oxygen). These disrupt the viral membrane and cause destruction of the nucleic acids, particularly at guanosine residues. The resulting nucleic acid modification can prevent viral replication and induce the inactivation of viruses through both Type I and II pathways [7]. The MB then reverts, in the presence of oxygen, back to its original state.",

Because the absorption spectrum of MB solution is between 620 nm and 700 nm, it is light in this range that shows reaction activity with MB solution. Light of other wavelengths should not inactivate virus with MB molecules. Therefore, if a white light source is used, strong illumination intensity is required. However, a high concentration of MB (e.g., 1 \u03bcM) and a short distance (e.g., 20 cm) is used in blood banking applications [4]. Because the emission of LEDs is almost monochromatic and can be characterized by a peak wavelength, light energy of an LED light source matching the peak wavelength of the MB photosensitizing agent can be transmitted to MB molecules in a high efficiency manner. Upon selecting LEDs matching the peak absorption of MB, lower illumination intensity was needed to inactivate virus at longer distance (e.g., present studies). Compared to a final concentration (i.e., 1 \u03bcM) which always works at 20 cm in previous photodynamic inactivation of enveloped RNA viruses in plasma, a much lower concentration of MB (1.0 \u03bcg/ml) can completely kill virus at 2.5 m in 5 min under our custom-designed narrow bandwidth light system. Thus a light source with narrow bandwidth matching the peak absorption of MB is an appealing technology for inactivation of enveloped RNA viruses. The results indicated that our MB/narrow bandwidth light system provides a powerful and easy way to inactivate enveloped virus in solution at a longer distance and in a shorter time than with traditional MB/light systems used in blood banking applications.",

Type I is the property of MB itself, i.e., its final working concentration. Type II is the feature of the narrow bandwidth light system, which includes the illumination intensity, time and distance. Increase of MB final concentration and/or illumination intensity enables the narrow bandwidth light system to kill or inactivate enveloped virus at much greater distance in much shorter time. The present studies indicate that the narrow bandwidth light system could be used as an appealing disinfectant tool for inactivation of enveloped virus in environments such as resting or working places where the surfaces were not shaded from the light source. In the European pharmacopoeia, MB is listed as a reagent suitable for external use [10]. High dose of MB (i.e., 2.0 mg/kg) has also been studied in the treatment of human septic shock and no adverse effect was observed [11]. Animal studies examining high-dose MB have also failed to demonstrate significant toxicity [12]. Therefore, our MB/SW-light system can be used continuously for a long time without any harm to humans.",
