In May that year, the first influenza A (H1N1) case was confirmed. The pandemic rapidly spread throughout the country and affected primarily the 5-14 age group, with more than 80% of the cases being reported in Lima . Surveillance of the pandemic in Peru provided valuable information about its behavior in a developing southern hemisphere country, with over 8,000 confirmed cases until September 2009. This figure represents a 4% increase in acute respiratory infections . However, information about etiological agents of viral respiratory infections in Peru is still limited. Active surveillance is therefore essential to identify the causative agents and improve clinical management, especially in the context of possible circulation of pandemic viruses [Schoub, 2006; Ren et al., 2009] .",

Respiratory viruses can cause a wide spectrum of illnesses in children, including pharyngitis, otitis media, laryngitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.

Viral culture and isolation is considered the gold standard, but this high-cost, elaborated technique is usually performed for research purposes. Antigen detection tests, such as direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, are more commonly used because of their lower cost and rapid results, but often lack sensitivity or specificity. Furthermore, these tests produce false negatives in a high percentage of cases [Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005] . Molecular techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis of respiratory viruses. Among them, PCR has shown to be the most sensitive and specific in detection of respiratory infectious agents, including samples with low copy number [van Elden et al., 2002; Freymuth et al., 2006; Van de Pol et al., 2007] .",

However, among 288 (40%) patients with a specific clinical diagnosis, 106 (14.8%) were diagnosed with pneumonia, probably because most samples were from hospitalized children, 580 (80.9%) ( Table I ).

Surveillance of influenza and other respiratory infections is crucial to identifying the distribution, trend and impact of viruses circulating in a population, even in non-pandemic periods [Watanabe et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2014] . Using routinely available hospital laboratory data at minimum extra cost is an important addition to the current respiratory virus surveillance system [Zhao et al., 2014] . Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a highly sensitive, specific method for the detection of a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses [van Elden et al., 2002; Mahony et al., 2007; Lamar\u00e3 o et al., 2012] . Compared to conventional diagnostic tests, like Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA), PCR increases diagnostic yields of respiratory virus detection from 24% to 43% of cases [Turner et al., 2013] . Therefore, PCR is the laboratory surveillance method of choice [Barenfanger et al., 2000; van Elden et al., 2002; Mahony et al., 2007; Van de Pol et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2014] . The above figures are consistent with our study results, which show that respiratory viral detection increases from 11.9%, by DFA to 33.5%, by PCR (Table II) . However, limited data are available regarding clinical presentation and strains of these viruses in Latin America Garcia et al., 2013; Turner et al., 2013; Grassi et al., 2014] . The prevalence of these pathogens is underestimated due to lack of rapid and proper virus identification tools in many areas [Alonso et al., 2012] . In Peru, respiratory virus surveillance has been conducted in 28 hospitals around the country since 2012. Samples of acute respiratory infection patients are analyzed by DFA and only influenza positive cases are subjected to PCR detection [Tejada, 2013] . Furthermore, collected data remain unpublished and few studies have been undertaken about circulating respiratory viruses in the last 5 years, especially concerning specific viral etiology detection (although a few more on viral surveillance can be found) [Forshey et al., Pathogens 0-1 (n \u00bc 432) 2-5 (n \u00bc 155) 6-10 (n \u00bc 56) >10 (n \u00bc 25) * NR (n \u00bc 49) Total patients (n \u00bc 717)",

Nevertheless, to establish seasonality for respiratory viruses can be challenging. A study aimed to provide epidemiologic information about human parainfluenza viruses in Latin American cities between 2006 and 2010 revealed differences in patterns depending on the climate, altitude, and latitude. Particularly, in Piura (Peru) PIV-1 showed several primary peaks between June and July. However, comparison of PIV-1 incidence between Piura (Peru) and Fortaleza (Brazil), located at only 2\u02daN, showed differences in distribution, suggesting that seasonality may be associated with temperature rather than distance from the Equator [Villaran et al., 2014] . In contrast, a constant, rather than seasonal, incidence was observed for PIV-1 in the Lima study whereas a higher incidence was reported during autumn for RSV-A, with more than 50% of cases detected, especially during May-June in 2009 and March-April in 2010. A similar seasonal distribution had been reported in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile [Luchsinger et al., 2008; Vidaurreta et al., 2011; Albuquerque et al., 2012] .",
