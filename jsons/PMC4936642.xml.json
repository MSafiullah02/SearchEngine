Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and Vero cells, used for expression confirmation studies, were maintained as described previously [12]. The variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chain segments for the CHIKV Env dMAb preparation were generated by using synthetic oligonucleotides with several modifications and were constructed as either a full-length immunoglobulin G (IgG; designated \u201cCVM1-IgG\u201d) or Fab fragment (designated \u201cCVM1-Fab\u201d) [31]. For cloning of CVM1-IgG, a single open reading frame was assembled containing the heavy and light chain genes, separated by a furin cleavage site coupled with a P2A self-processing peptide sequence. This transgene was cloned into the pVax1 expression vector [31]. The CVM1-Fab VH and VL chains were cloned into separate pVax1 vectors. For tissue culture transfection, 100 \u03bcg of pVax1 DNA, CVM1-IgG, or CVM1-Fab (100 \u03bcg of each VH and VL construct) was used. The CHIKV Env\u2013based DNA vaccine used in the study was developed and characterized as previously described [11, 12].",

Thus, a DNA plasmid (dMAb) expressing the light and heavy immunoglobulin chains of a neutralizing anti-CHIKV mAb recognizing both E1 and E2 Env proteins was designed [23, 24]. The complementary DNAs for the coding sequences of the VL and VH immunoglobulin chains for full-length anti-CHIKV dMAb were optimized for increased expression and cloned into a pVax1 vector, using previously described methods [25, 31]. For the constructs expressing anti\u2013CHIKV-Fab, the VH and VL genes were cloned separately. The optimized synthetic plasmids constructed from the anti-Env\u2013specific CHIKV-neutralizing mAb were designated CVM1-IgG or CVM1-Fab, for the IgG and Fab antibodies, respectively. Human 293T cells were transfected with either the CVM1-IgG plasmid or the CVM1-Fab (VL, VH, or combined) plasmids to validate expression in vitro. As indicated in Figure 1A and 1B , anti-CHIKV antibody levels were measured by ELISA with recombinant CHIKV Env used as the binding antigen. These data indicate that the CVM1-Fab and CVM1-IgG expressed antibodies in the muscle that appeared to be properly assembled and biologically functional in vitro.\n",

Sera were collected at indicated time points, and target antigen binding was measured by IgG quantification, using ELISA. Although mAbs generated from CVM1-Fab appeared more rapidly (ie, within 3 days after injection) than those from CVM1-IgG, both constructs generated similar mAb levels by day 15 (mean sera levels [\u00b1SD], 1587.23 \u00b1 73.23 ng/mL of CVM1-Fab and 1341.29 \u00b1 82.07 ng/mL of CVM1-IgG; Figure 1C).

Sera collected 15 days after injection from both CVM1-IgG and CVM1-Fab bound to CHIKV Env protein but not to an unrelated control antigen, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Env (Figure 1D).

            "text": "One potential issue of combining antibody delivery with vaccination approaches is that the antibodies can neutralize many traditional vaccines [12, 25, 32, 41] and thus are incompatible platforms. The effect of coadminstration of CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env on mouse survival in the context of CHIKV challenge was also evaluated. In this experiment, 20 mice were administered at day 0 a single dose of CVM1-IgG and 3 doses of CHIKV Env DNA as described above. Subsequently, half of the animals were challenged with CHIKV at day 2 and the other half at day 35. Survival in these groups was followed as a function of time. Not unexpectedly, both of the challenge groups had 100% long-term survival (Figure 4C). Specifically, results of the day 2 CHIKV challenge experiment indicated the utility of the CVM1-IgG reagent in mediating protection from infection, with the survival percentage decreasing to approximately 30% by 4 days after challenge in control (pVax1) animals. Figure 4D indicates levels of anti-CHIKV IgG, by time, generated in mice that received CVM1-IgG and CHIKV Env DNA vaccine; anti-CHIKV human IgG represents antibody produced by the CVM1-IgG plasmid and anti-CHIKV mouse IgG represents antibody induced by the CHIKV Env vaccine. Both human IgG and mouse IgG were detected and exhibited different expression kinetics. By 3 days after initial CHIKV Env DNA vaccination, mouse anti-Env antibody levels were essentially near 0 (mouse anti-CHIKV IgG). Conversely, 3 days after a single CVM1-IgG injection, human anti-Env antibody levels were significant (human anti-CHIKV IgG). These data underscore the importance of CVM1-IgG in mediating rapid protection from infection and death after CHIKV challenge.",

Mice immunized with CVM1 IgG, CVM1 Fab, CHIKV Env, or CVM1 IgG plus CHIKV Env DNA vaccine generated mAb and significantly reduced viral loads (Figure 5A). In addition to viral load reduction, these mice did not exhibit footpad swelling, compared with control (pVax1) immunized mice, and consistently gained body weight during the 20-day experimental period (Figure 5B and 5C). Also the CVM1-IgG\u2013generated mAb and the CHIKV Env DNA vaccine exhibited significantly reduced levels of CHIKV-mediated proinflammatory cytokines (ie, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-\u03b2), compared with pVax1, 10 days after viral challenge (Supplementary Figure 2).

A similar level of protection occurred in mice administered a single dose of CVM1-IgG, although protection waned to 80% over time.

A, BALB/c mice were injected with 100 \u03bcg of CVM1-IgG, 100 \u03bcg of pVax1 (negative control), or 25 \u03bcg of CHIKV-Env DNA on day 0 and challenged on day 2 with CHIKV Del-03 (JN578247; 1 \u00d7 107 plaque-forming units in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL). B, BALB/c mice were administered either a single injection of 100 \u03bcg of CVM1-IgG on day 0 or 3 immunizations of 25 \u03bcg of CHIKV Env DNA on day 0, day 14, and day 28 and then challenged on day 35 under the same conditions and with the same CHIKV isolate. C, Groups of 20 BALB/c mice were administered a single 100 \u03bcg injection of CVM1-IgG on day 0 and 3 immunizations with CHIKV-Env DNA (25 \u03bcg) on day 0, day 14, and day 28. Half of the mice were then challenged on day 2, and the remaining half were challenged on day 35 under the same conditions and with the same CHIKV isolate challenge described above. The black arrow indicates plasmid injection, and the red arrow indicates the time of viral challenge. For each study, mice were monitored for 20 days after challenge, and survival rates were recorded. D, Induction of persistent and systemic anti-CHIKV Env antibodies following a single CVM1-IgG (human anti-CHIKV Env) injection and CHIKV-Env immunization (mouse anti-CHIKV Env) 1 week after the second immunization in mice. Binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed as described in \u201cMaterial and Methods\u201d section. For D mean OD450 values are shown \u00b1SD.",

Mice were weighed on the specified days after inoculation. Results are presented as mean body weights (\u00b1SD). C, Swelling of the hind feet was quantified using calipers on the specified days among mice that received CVM1-IgG, CHIKV-Env, CVM1-IgG plus CHIKV-Env, or pVax1. Data are mean values (\u00b1SD).
