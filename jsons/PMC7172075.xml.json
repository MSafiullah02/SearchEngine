The \u2013NH2 group of bestatin was protected by N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group using previously reported procedure.27 Since probestin is not commercially available, the SPPS method would allow synthesizing it in a short time in milligram quantities required for preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies. It is important to note that probestin is the most potent APN inhibitor based on a natural product.21, 28 Additionally, we investigated the effect of probestin as an angiogenesis inhibitor using a chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and a CAM breast tumor xenograft model. To our best knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the anti-angiogenesis effects of probestin.",

The reason was that the synthesis of a peptide containing a proline residue or its derivative at the first or second position from the C-terminal using Wang resin is prone to undergo diketopiperazine (DKP) formation during the Fmoc deprotection step of the second residue.31 In our case, a cyclic diproline (a DKP) shown in Figure 1b is expected to be formed during the Fmoc deprotection of the second proline residue by 20% piperidine. Thus, we have chosen the sterically hindered 2-Cl Trt resin. The use of sterically bulky chlorotrityl group has been shown to prevent the cyclization and the premature peptide cleavage due to formation of DKP.31 The probestin was obtained in an overall yield of 31\u201333% (three batches) after HPLC purification. The HPLC purification was carried out using our previously reported conditions.30 Mass spectral analyses was consistent with the calculated value (ES-MS calcd m/z for C26H38N4O6: 502.3; found: 503.4 ([M+H]+) and ESI HRMS calculated: 501.2713 ([M\u2212H]\u2212); found: 501.2736).

About 8\u201310 separate embryos were used for each compound. After 8 h, either PBS or sunitinib (25 \u03bcM), bestatin (10 \u03bcM), or probestin (10 \u03bcM) were applied topically to the surface of the filter discs. We included sunitinib as a reference to compare the antiangiogenic activity of probestin since sunitinib is a well-known FDA-approved angiogenesis inhibitor. Sunitinib is a standard VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2)/PDGFR receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) kinase inhibitor. The VEGFR-2 is an important receptor in VEGF-induced mitogenesis.33 Similarly bestatin was also included for comparison as it is a well known APN inhibitor and it is an approved anticancer drug (Ubenimex) in Japan.34 After 48 h, the CAMs were removed, fixed and the representative areas were photographed (Fig. 2\na). The blood vessel branch points present within the area defined by the filter disc were counted in a blinded fashion using a high power stereo microscope. As shown in Figure 2b, probestin was effective in blocking VEGF-induced angiogenesis similar to sunitinib. Interestingly, probestin had very little effect on preexisting blood vessels of the CAM, indicating that the compound exerts a specific action on proliferating microvessels (Fig. 2a).",

It was found that probestin reduced both the vascularity and the size of resulting tumors significantly more than bestatin at an equivalent concentration (Fig. 3\n). It is important to note that MDA-MB-435 cells are APN negative,20 the tumor growth inhibition by probestin thus appeared to be through a direct targeting of APN expressed on the tumor angiogenesis. These results are consistent with those previously observed growth inhibition of mouse xenografts derived from MDA-MB-435 cells by two rat antimouse APN antibodies.20 The effect of sunitinib on the reduction of the blood vessel density and the tumor volume was significantly more than both bestatin and probestin. The reasons for this lower effect exhibited by probestin or bestatin compared to sunitinib are currently unknown. It is important to note that probestin/bestatin and sunitinib binds to different targets and the expression levels of those targets could be different. However, these preliminary results indicate the antitumor and anti-angiogenic activity of probestin and warrants further investigation of probestin as an angiogenesis inhibitor.",

Weights were taken over a 6 week period and animals were observed for acute distress during the first 96 h after injection. Our main criteria for MTD was significant (P <0.05, one-way ANOVA with Neuman\u2013Keuls post test) weight loss over the 6 week period. No apparent toxicity and no significant weight loss (P >0.05; one-way ANOVA with Neuman\u2013Keuls post-test) was observed throughout a 6 week period after drug administration for 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg dosage groups. However, the animals displayed signs of weight loss for 300 mg/kg dosage group and thus this study indicates 300 mg/kg as the MTD.
