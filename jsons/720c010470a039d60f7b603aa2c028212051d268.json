At this point the diagnosis of exclusion is temporal arteritis (TA) with large vessel involvement. The presence of a subclavian bruit also suggests proximal occlusion. Takayasu's arteritis is also a possibility but less likely given the patient's age and ethnicity. Atherosclerosis needs to be considered but again should not be associated with this degree of inflammation. Large-vessel involvement in giant cell arteritis occurs in over a quarter of patients with this disease. Stenosis of the primary and secondary branches of the aorta may cause claudication and tissue gangrene, whereas aortitis may lead to aneurysm formation and dissection, often many years after the initial diagnosis. The important thing here is to treat the inflammation and ensure that no other organs are involved. A temporal artery biopsy is the best next step. Occasionally TA can be silent and only becomes apparent when a biopsy is performed. ",

It is seen most commonly in multiparous women, but also in some degenerative conditions. It is merely a benign reflection of bone remodeling with response to stress, but with the increased radiologic density it is indicative of sclerosis. The SI joints themselves are normal or may feature some degenerative -but not inflammatory or erosive -changes. This condition may sometimes be confused with sacroiliitis, but it can be differentiated by its unilateral nature, lack of erosive or other inflammatory features, both locally and in the spine, and the general absence of clinical symptoms.",

Note the renal transplant.Renal osteodystrophy combines features of secondary hyperparathyroidism, rickets, osteomalacia, and osteoporosis. Bone resorption in renal osteodystrophy is quite complex. Renal retention of phosphate results in hyperphosphatemia, which reduces serum ionized calcium levels, therefore inducing hyperparathyroidism. The hyperparathyroidism increases bone resorption, which may normalize serum calcium levels by releasing the osseous storage of calcium. The various sites of bone resorption include the subperiosteal region of the phalanges, the phalangeal tufts, proximal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, distal clavicle, and calvarial trabeculae. If parathormone levels are mildly elevated over a longer period of time, its effect on bone tends to be anabolic. These effects include excessive maturation of osteoblasts leading to new bone formation and increased laying down of osteoid, which calcifies under the influence of secondarily elevated serum calcium levels. This patient has classic endplate involvement, which results in the appearance of a \"Rugger jersey.\"",
