Cervical lymphadenopathy most commonly represents a transient reactive response to a benign local or generalized infection, but occasionally it might herald the presence of a more serious disorder (eg, malignancy). Lymphadenitis specifi cally refers to lymphadenopathies that are caused by infl ammatory processes [ 4\u2022\u2022 ] .

Antimicrobial therapy may have to be modifi ed once a causative agent is identifi ed, depending on the clinical response of the existing treatment.

If possible drug resistance is a concern, ethambutol or an aminoglycoside should be added to the initial three-drug combination until drug susceptibilities are determined, and an infectious disease specialist should be consulted [ 27 ] . Nontuberculosis mycobacterial lymphadenitis is best treated with surgical excision of all visibly infected nodes [ 16\u2022\u2022 ] . A recent randomized, controlled trial enrolled 100 children with nontuberculous cervical adenitis to receive surgical excision ( n = 50) or antibiotic therapy with clarithromycin and rifabutin ( n = 50) [ 16\u2022\u2022 ] . Based on intention-to-treat analysis, the surgical cure rate was 96% versus 66% in the medical arm after 6 months. Furthermore, there were more adverse events in the medical arm. However, the major complication of surgery is permanent damage to the facial nerve, which occurred in about 2% of patients. Transient facial nerve involvement occurred in another 12% [ 16\u2022\u2022 ] . Thus, careful consideration must be given to the location of the adenitis in the determination of node removal. When surgery is not feasible due to risk to the facial nerve, a two-drug antimycobacterial regimen that includes a macrolide should be considered [ 6 , 16\u2022\u2022 , 28 ] . Failure of medical therapy usually cannot be explained as a result of development of resistant organisms [ 16\u2022\u2022 ] .",
