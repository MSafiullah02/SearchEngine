It may also provide a useful research tool to study the function of cloned genes in pulmonary endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Among the viral vectors employed for such potential use,1,2 adenoviral vectors have proved to be limited with respect to efficiency in part because of difficulty in assuring significant residence time in the lung and/or paucity of receptors for adenovirus on endothelium. Also, adenoviral vectors are only moderately effective in infecting primary mouse lung endothelial cells in vitro. First-generation cationic lipidic vectors also produce modest degrees of gene transfer to lung after i.v. administration.3,4 Modification of cationic lipid composition and DNA:lipid ratios led to considerably higher gene transfer efficiency in the lung with the endothelial cells being the major cell type transfected.5,6,7,8,9,10 However, gene expression in the lung via this gene transfer protocol is transient and lasts for only a few days. In the current study, we investigate whether in vitro and in vivo gene transfer to mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) can be significantly improved using an EBV-based expression plasmid.",

The viral elements required for episomal replication and nuclear retention are the cis-acting replication origin (oriP) of the EBV gene and the EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1), which interacts with the oriP region.11,12,13 Plasmids containing the oriP and EBNA-1 sequences are maintained as low-copy number DNA episomes in the cell nucleus and replicate once per cell cycle in primate cells. Most studies suggest that long-term replication of EBV-derived plasmids occurs only in primate cells but not in rodent cells.11,14 Nonetheless, a more persistent gene expression was found in a number of rodent tissues following nonviral method-mediated delivery of EBV plasmid compared to non-EBV plasmid possibly because of the nuclear retention function and the enhancer activity of transgene expression induced by EBNA-1.15,16,17,18 We hypothesize that lipofection of MLEC can also be significantly improved both in vitro and in vivo using the EBV-based plasmid.",

Plasmids pGEG.GL3 and pG.GL3 contain the firefly luciferase gene under the control of a CAG promoter. pGEG.GL3 also contains an EBV EBNA-1 gene driven by a CAG promoter. In addition, pGEG.GL3 contains the EBV oriP. Plasmid pNGVL3-Luc contains the firefly luciferase gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. In the initial experiment, we compared the level of gene expression in the lung with pGEG.GL3 using two different gene transfer protocols, that is, complex injection and sequential injection. With a non-EBV plasmid, we have shown recently that sequential injection of cationic liposomes and plasmid is more efficient in pulmonary gene transfer than injection of cationic liposome/DNA complexes.19 Furthermore, sequential injection is associated with a significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine response.19 A similar result was observed in this study with an EBV-based plasmid. As shown in Figure 2a, serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 in sequential injection group were only 30% of those in complex injection group. Furthermore, sequential injection of DOTAP:cholesterol liposomes and pGEG.GL3 led to a significantly higher level of gene expression in the lung than complex injection (Figure 2b). We and others have shown that proinflammatory cytokines can significantly inhibit transgene expression in either viral or nonviral vector-mediated gene transfer.20,21,22,23 The improved pulmonary gene transfer via sequential injection protocol is probably because of a decreased inhibitory effect of cytokines on transgene expression. Thus, sequential injection protocol was used in subsequent studies.",

Peak expression of luciferase occurred on day 1 for all plasmids. However, of the three plasmids, gene expression in pNGVL3-Luc group declined most rapidly with time and was not different from background by 21 days. Gene expression in the pGEG.GL3 group declined during the first week following sequential injection, but then there was a rebound in gene expression over the subsequent 2 weeks. A similar phenomenon was observed in a study with complex injection.24 The rapid decline in gene expression in the first few days following injection is probably largely because of the inhibitory effect of cytokines. Despite a decreased cytokine response in sequential injection (Figure 2a), the level of TNF-\u03b1 in the serum might be sufficient to cause significant inhibition on transgene expression. Nevertheless, the levels of gene expression in pGEG.GL3 group were significantly higher than those in pG.GL3 or pNGVL3-Luc group at all time points examined. Of note is that even after 3 weeks, there is a detectable level of gene expression in lungs of mice injected with pGEG.GL3.",

No green cells were observed in the lungs of mice treated with a control plasmid (pGEG.GL3) (data not shown). In contrast, there was localized gene expression throughout the distal lung of mice that received pGEG.EGFP (Figure 4a). The cell type of transfected cells was further analyzed by anti-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) immunofluorescence staining of the lung sections. Constitutive expression of PECAM-1 is a fundamental characteristic of endothelial cells.25 As shown in Figure 4a and b, EGFP signal was substantially colocalized with PECAM labeling, confirming that endothelial cells were the major cell type transfected.",

Primary MLEC were prepared by modification of an immunobead protocol.26 Briefly, mouse lungs were finely minced and digested in collagenase (Type I, 100 \u03bcg/ml). Cell suspensions were incubated with a monoclonal antibody (rat anti-mouse) to PECAM-1 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. PECAM-1 has been used extensively as a reliable marker to isolate endothelial cells.26 The cells were washed twice with buffer to remove unbound antibody, and resuspended in binding buffer containing the appropriate number of washed magnetic beads coated with sheep anti-rat IgG (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Attached cells were washed four to five times in cell culture medium, and then were digested with trypsin/EDTA to detach the beads. Bead-free cells were centrifuged and resuspended for culture. At approximately passage 2, cells were incubated with fluorescent-labeled di-acetylated LDL (diI-LDL), which is taken up only by endothelial cells and macrophages, and sorted to homogeneity by FACS. The enriched PECAM and diI-LDL population were subcultured in DMEM/F-12, 20% FBS, 6% plasma-derived human serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 30 \u03bcg/ml endothelial-derived growth factor. Figure 5 shows gene expression in MLEC following transfection with pGEG.GL3, pG.GL3, or pNGVL3-Luc. More persistent and significantly higher level gene expression was achieved with pGEG.GL3. It should be noted that transfection of MLEC in this study was performed using a nonoptimized reagent (DOTAP:cholesterol liposomes). Gene expression in MLEC should be further improved via optimization of transfection condition. This will greatly facilitate the use of this gene transfer protocol as a research tool to study the functions of cloned genes in MLEC in vitro. EBV plasmid coupled with cationic liposome and HVJ-liposome has also been shown to efficiently transfect human primary cells in vitro.27",
