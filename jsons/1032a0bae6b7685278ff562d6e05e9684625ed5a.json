It is significant for predicting the structure and function of RNA that learning about the stability and the process of RNA pseudoknot folding and unfolding. The structural features of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA pseudoknot in different ion concentration, the unfolding process of the RNA pseudoknot, and the two hairpin helices that constitute the RNA pseudoknot were studied with all atom molecule dynamics simulation method in this paper. We found that the higher cation concentration can cause structure of the RNA molecules more stable, and ions played an indispensable role in keeping the structure of RNA molecules stable; the unfolding process of hairpin structure was corresponding to the antiprocess of its folding process. The main pathway of pseudoknot unfolding was that the inner base pair opened first, and then, the two helices, which formed the RNA pseudoknot opened decussately, while the folding pathway of the RNA pseudoknot was a helix folding after formation of the other helix. Therefore, the unfolding process of RNA pseudoknot is different from the antiprocess of its folding process, and the unfolding process of each helix in the RNA pseudoknot is similar to the hairpin structure's unfolding process, which means that both are the unzipping process.",

For instance, the psuedoknot in the central of catalytic domain forms the core structure motif in the telomerase RNA [16] [17] [18] . Moreover, many viruses regulate retroviral gene expression by ribosomal frameshifting, while the pseudoknot plays an indispensable role in promoting ribosomal frameshifting [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . In addition, the pseudoknot mutation, which is caused by strengthening or weakening it stability thermally or mechanically, can lead to the change of ribosomal frameshifting efficiency [29, 30] . For these and other problems of RNA, it is essential to reveal the mechanism of RNA function and design therapeutic strategies for the diseases in order to quantitatively predict the structure and stability of pseudoknot. The structural feature of pseudoknot provide a very favorable model to further study the folding and unfolding of complex biological molecules. Some excellent works about RNA pseudoknot have been studied, such as the folding/unfolding process of a pseudoknot in human telomerase RNA was researched using optical tweezers at different loads [31, 32] , which give direct evidence of the formation of nonnative structures and complex folding pathways. However, the folding/ unfolding pathways for other RNA pseudoknots and how the pathways would change under different conditions are still not clear.",

Previous studies [33] [34] [35] [36] have shown that over 90% incidences of the mouse breast cancer are related to the MMTV. In this paper, the unfolding process of MMTV RNA molecule (protein data bank (PDB) ID: 1KPD) is studied with all atom molecule dynamics simulation methods, from which we can obtain structure transition at the atomistic scale.

The TIP3P water model is adopted, and Na ions are added to maintain the whole system's electrical neutrality. Using periodic boundary conditions, a rectangular water box is established as the distance between the box boundary and the atoms of the RNA molecule in the box is at least 25 \u00c5. The long-range electrostatic interactions are calculated by the particle mesh Ewald method. The system uses isothermal isobaric ensemble, and the time step is set as 1 fs.",

If the RNA will form a stable structure, it should be in the salt solution, in which the metal ions are critical for RNA tertiary structural formation because the ions can neutralize backbone charge repulsion [44] [45] [46] . To study the effects of the ion concentration on the structure of RNA, the pseudoknot structures were studied in the NaCl solution with two ion concentrations 0.1 mol/L and 0.5 mol/L at the same temperature (290 K) and same pressure (1atm); meanwhile, 32 Na + ions were mingled within water in order to make the total charge of the RNA become zero. The hydrogen bonds of the two heli-ces of the RNA pseudoknot during the simulation time at the two ion concentrations of 0.5 mol/L and 0.1 mol/L are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. It shows that at the concentration of 0.5 mol/L, all the hydrogen bond lengths of the base pairs are within the range of 3.5 \u00c5 and keep stable, while at the concentration of 0.1 mol/L, the hydrogen bond of the base pairs are not quite stable. The above results indicate that the ions played an indispensable role in keeping the structure stable for RNA molecules, the higher cation concentration will cause the more stable structure of the RNA molecules. As the main chain of RNA has strong negative charge, forming the base pair between different nucleotides must overcome the strong electrostatic repulsion between the main chains. The positive ions in the salt solution could neutralize the negative charge of the RNA, and the higher ion concentration makes it easier to form a compact structure.",

It can be found that the base pairs retaining probabilities of helix 1 and helix 2 are all oscillating decreasing, which indicates that helix 1 and helix 2 are unfolding at the same time. The two helices unfold entirely in about 20 ns. Figure 4 (b) displays some important structures during the unfolding process of MMTV molecule in the temperature of 400 K. At 0.5 ns, the base pair 5C-15G of helix 1 is opened; at 6.5 ns, the 12C-28G base pair of helix 2 is opened; at 8.0 ns, the base pairs 5C-15G, 4G-16C of helix 1 and 12C-28G of helix 2 are opened; at 10.8 ns, 1G-19C of helix 1 is opened; and at 12.2 ns, 2C-18G is opened.

As can be seen from the figure, helix 1 and helix 2 are unfolding almost at the same time, and the two helices that formed the RNA pseudoknot open decussately. At 1.5 ns, the base pair retaining the probability of helix 2 decreases to 0.5, while that of helix 1 decreases to 0.6. At 2.5 ns, the base pairs of helix 1 and helix 2 are totally opened, and the whole RNA molecule is unfolded. Figure 5 (b) shows some important intermediate structures during the unfolding process of MMTV molecule in the temperature of 450 K. At 0.5 ns, the base pair 5C-15G of helix 1 opens first, which make the pseudoknot form a bulge. At 1.5 ns, the opened base pairs include 5C-15G, 9G-31C, and 11G-29C; helix 1 and helix 2 are nearly opened at 2.5 ns, but the main chain conformation of the RNA molecule does not show enormous changes during the period. As the bases swing or reverse, base pairs show the characteristics of open-close switching. To 6.5 ns, the base pairs are all opened and RNA main chain would branch out, the structure of the RNA becomes loose gradually, and the entire RNA molecule transforms into a complete long chain.",

The entropy change is about 37.08 cal/(K \u2022 mol) when the 5C-15G base pair is opened, which is greater than the entropy change of opening a single base pair. Next, the base pairs of the two helices open decussately, while RNA pseudoknot folding path was a helix folding after formation of the other helix.

The two melting temperatures are similar with that of the pseudoknot molecule. Figure 7 (a) displays the base pairs retaining probability of helix 1 during unfolding process at 400 K. We find that the base pairs of helix 1 completely open in about 3 ns. Figure 7(b) shows some important structures during the unfolding process. At 0.55 ns, the base pairs of 1G-19C, 2C-18G at the end of the helix open in turn; at 1.6 ns, the base pair 5C-15G near the loop opens; to 2.0 ns, 3C-17G opens; at 2.4 ns, the last remaining paired base pair 4G-16C opens, and then, the entire helix of the hairpin completely opens in less than 3.0 ns. Figure 8 (a) shows the base pairs retaining probability of helix 1 during unfolding process at 450 K, which indicates that the base pairs of helix 1 completely open in about 2.5 ns. Figure 8 (b) shows some important structures during the unfolding process.

Thus, the RNA is unfolded completely. Figure 9 (a) shows the base pairs retaining probability of helix 2 during unfolding process at 400 K. The base pairs of helix 2 are completely open in about 5 ns as the figure shows. Figure 9 (b) displays some representative structures during the unfolding process of helix 2.

The main unfolding path of a hairpin structure is given as follows: the base pair at the two ends of the helix opens first, and then it is unfolded by an unzipping process. The unfolding process is corresponding to the antiprocess of its folding process. While RNA pseudoknot folding path was a helix folding after formation of the other helix, the unfolding process of RNA pseudoknot differed from the antiprocess of the folding process. The unfolding process of each helix in the RNA pseudoknot is similar to the hairpin structure's unfolding process, and both are the unzipping process. ",
