Thus, the omission of the brain in listings of anatomical parts is not due to a lack of knowledge of the existence of this part of the body. Instead, it rather points to an absence of interest in the brain, probably reflecting insufficient awareness of its role in relation to the mind.",

Nevertheless, some early discourses depict their attainment as involving what literally would be a \u201ctouching by way of the body\u201d (MN 70: k\u0101yena phusitv\u0101/phassitv\u0101 and M\u0100 195: \u8eab\u89f8; the latter refers to the whole set of eight liberations, which include the immaterial attainments).

Early Buddhist thought stands out in its historical setting for an emphasis on the mind and intentionality. This can be seen, for example, in a debate with a follower of the Jain tradition, reported in the Up\u0101li-sutta (MN 56 and M\u0100 133). Regarding the relative importance of bodily, verbal, and mental activities in relation to unwholesome and reprehensible deeds, according to this discourse, the representative of the Jain tradition took the position that bodily activities are the most important of these three. This might at first sight seem obvious, simply because bodily activities can inflict greater harm and hence need above all to be restrained. Yet, the Buddha disagreed, instead according chief importance to mental activities. The position taken in this way reflects the overarching concern with intentionality in early Buddhist ethics. Viewed from this perspective, bodily infliction of harm is ultimately due to harmful mental intentions that lead to reprehensible physical acts.",

When questioned by the Buddha about cultivation of the mind, however, it turned out that the debater had no clear idea of what this could imply.

These five had been the companions of the Buddha-to-be during his own practice of asceticism. Once he realized that ascetic practice was not conducive to liberation and abandoned it, these five left him in the belief that he had forsaken the path to awakening. According to the Ariyapariyesan\u0101-sutta and its parallel, the Buddha did not find it easy to persuade these five that abandoning ascetic practice could actually be part of a path to awakening, rather than automatically implying a reversion to a life of sensual indulgence.

However much these animals struggle to escape in one direction or another, due to being firmly bound to the post they are unable to do so. This illustrates the potential of mindfulness of the body to provide an element of centering that counters the tendency toward a fragmentation of experience, which easily happens when the mind follows whatever happens to be the most prominent object at any of the senses. With mindfulness of the body established, it becomes possible to remain centered and balanced, regardless of what happens at any sense door.

Yet, acting out that impulse is a way of succumbing to the fear and reacting to it, rather than facing anxiety calmly for what it is. Of course, fear can at times have an important function. But the type of noise described in the discourse does not give the impression that there was an urgent need for the Buddha-to-be to protect himself.
