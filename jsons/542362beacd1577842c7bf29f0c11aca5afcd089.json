            "text": "Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) emerged in the last decade of the twentieth century. They were the cause of a number of outbreaks of respiratory and neurological disease infecting horses and pigs respectively. Transmission from infected domestic animal species resulted in human infections as well, with high case fatality rates a feature. Today they continue to cause outbreaks of human and animal disease. NiV causes yearly disease outbreaks in humans in Bangladesh, and HeV causes sporadic disease outbreaks in horses in north eastern Australia. Due to their zoonotic nature, they have been ideal candidates for collaborative projects in the One Health space, bringing public health and animal health professionals together. This has lead to insightful epidemiological studies, which has resulted in practical disease prevention solutions including a horse vaccine for HeV and NiV spill-over prevention interventions in the field. As more surveillance is undertaken, their known distributions have expanded, as has the range of reservoir host species. The majority of bat species for which there is evidence of henipavirus infection belong to the group known as the Old World family of fruit and nectar feeding bats (Family Pteropodidae, Suborder Megachiroptera). This review of the bat borne henipaviruses discusses the epidemiology, pathology, transmission and disease symptoms in these closely related viruses which belong to the Genus Henipavirus, Family Paramyxoviridae.",

It most likely had close contact with HeV laden material from an infected horse, but was clinically well and remained so until it was euthanized in accordance with national policy 2 . Since this time, experimental infections in dogs have been conducted at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, to better understand the role that dogs might play in the epidemiology of the disease. In these studies dogs could be reliably infected with HeV. Consistent with the field observation, few if any clinical signs were noted during the acute stage of infection. Viral shedding from the oral cavity occurred for a relatively short period of time, and oral secretions collected from dogs during this period were capable of transmitting infection to na\u00efve ferrets (Middleton 2013) . Neutralising antibody titres generated in these dogs were similar to that observed in the single recorded canine field case of HeV infection. In dogs, the key site of virus replication within the oral cavity was the tonsil. Middleton (2013) concludes that it is feasible for Hendra virus to be transmitted to people from acutely infected dogs. Further studies are planned to test the repeatability of these observations as well as to assess the duration of the period of maximum transmission risk.",

Luckily for horses, these bat samples rarely contain high titres of virus.

The reproductive cycle in other bat species has been linked to seropositivity and viral activity of other viruses including filoviruses, coronaviruses, lyssaviruses and astroviruses (Pourrut et al. 2007; Drexler et al. 2011; Turmelle et al. 2010) .",

In one bat colony, seroprevalence steadily increased from 45 to 69 % over a 2 year period supporting a model of endemic infection in the population (Breed et al. 2011) . Absence of disease attributable to HeV infection is supported by experimental observations (Halpin et al. 2011) . This is consistent with the observation that many viruses do not cause disease in their reservoir host. The long-term coexistence of viruses and their reservoir hosts has given co-evolution a good chance to reach a relative equilibrium (Domingo 2010) .

Neutralizing antibodies to NiV were detected in Pteropus hypomenalus and Pteropus vampyrus during wildlife surveillance following the initial NiV outbreak in Malaysia in 1999, but NiV was not isolated at this time (Yob et al. 2001 ). The first NiV isolates from bats were obtained from colonies of Pteropus hypomenalus on Tioman Island, Malaysia . Since then, antibodies to NiV have been detected in other Pteropus species ( Pteropus lylei, Pteropus giganteus) and less frequently in other species of bats including Hipposideros larvatus and Scotophiilus kuhli from Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Bangladesh (Hsu et al. 2004; Reynes et al. 2005; Sendow et al. 2006; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2005) . In 2000, NiV was isolated from a urine sample collected underneath the roost of Pteropus lylei bats in Cambodia (Reynes et al. 2005) . More recently, Nipah virus was isolated from Pteropus vampyrus in Malaysia (Sohayati et al. 2011) . Serologic evidence of Nipah infection was also obtained from Rousettus leschen and Cynoptera sphinx in Vietnam (Hasebe et al. 2012) . Several species of Chinese bats also contained antibodies to Nipah or Nipah-like viruses (Li et al. 2008) . A very thorough study of the presence of henipaviruses in Australasia indicated that NiV was present in East Timor and that non-NiV, non-HeV henipaviruses were present in Sumba, Sulawesi, and possibly Papua New Guinea (Breed et al. 2013) . The authors suggested that NiV can be detected in areas where Pteropus vampyrus is present. In Madagascar, seropositive Pteropus rufus and Eidolon dupreahum bats have been found, and 39 % of Eidolon helvum from Ghana had NiV reactive antibodies (Hayman et al. 2008; Iehle et al. 2007 ). Henipavirus-like sequences were obtained from Eidolon helvum in Ghana (Drexler et al. 2009 ). The detection of antibodies to and sequences of henipaviruses in African bats suggests that the range of potential NiV infections may be wider than previously thought, though no human cases of NiV have been reported from any region other than Southeast Asia.

The epidemiologic characteristics of the outbreaks in Bangladesh differed from the Malaysia outbreaks in several respects. Most notably, the case fatality rate in Bangladesh (2001-2010) ranged from 38 % to as high as 100 %, with an average mortality rate of 73 %, while the mortality rate for Malaysia was approximately 38 % . Infected individuals in Bangladesh were more likely to have respiratory symptoms, and there was evidence of humanto-human spread. Luby et al. 2009b showed in their study that Nipah case-patients who had difficulty breathing were more likely than those without respiratory difficulty to transmit Nipah. Although a small minority of infected patients transmit Nipah virus, more than half of identified cases result from person-to-person transmission. In these cases, virus was spread during close contact while caring for sick individuals or preparing bodies for burial (Blum et al. 2009; Chadha et al. 2006; Luby et al. 2009b) .",

In Australia there are many bat carers who have close contact to sick and injured bats. They get bitten and scratched and come into contact with urine and faecal material, as well as placenta and birthing fluids. However, no bat carer has ever been diagnosed with infection. An extensive serological survey of bat carers in Queensland was performed in the mid 1990s, and there was no serological evidence of exposure to the virus (Selvey et al. 1996) . However, bat carers are at risk of becoming infected with Australian bat lyssavirus. In one HeV experiment, a small amount of viral RNA was detected in the nasal secretions of HeV infected horses two days after exposure to the virus and at least 2 days before the onset of clinical signs, suggesting that transmission of the virus from the infected horse may be possible before it is obviously unwell ). However at this early stage of infection, the amount of viral genome detected was very low and it is unlikely that this would be enough to infect another host. The findings also supported the observation in experimentally infected pteropus bats that a local mucosal infection, from days two to approximately six post exposure precedes a systemic infection (Halpin et al. 2011) . Only after the systemic infection has been established does it become possible to isolate infectious virus from urine and blood.",

            "text": "In contrast to Malaysia where pigs clearly served as the amplifying host that facilitated spread of the virus from bats to humans, no intermediate animal host was identified in Bangladesh. Several routes of transmission of NiV from bats to humans have been identified by studying the nearly annual outbreaks in Bangladesh and the single outbreak in India. Consumption of contaminated date palm sap or contaminated fruit has been linked to a number of cases and outbreaks in Bangladesh (Rahman et al. 2012) . Case-patients reported no history of physical contact with bats, though community members often reported seeing bats. Infrared camera photographs have shown that Pteropus bats frequently visited date palm trees in those communities where sap was collected for human consumption. This provided an opportunity for intervention in an attempt to prevent NiV spillover to humans. It has been shown that skirts (made from bamboo, dhoincha, jute stick and/or polythene) covering the sap producing areas of a tree effectively prevented bat-sap contact . Genetic analysis of NiV isolates and sequences obtained from clinical samples indicated that the outbreaks in Bangladesh were the result of multiple, independent introductions of virus into the human population (Harcourt et al. 2005; Luby et al. 2009b ). Sequences of NiV isolates from human outbreaks in India and Bangladesh showed more heterogeneity than the sequences obtained in the initial Malaysian outbreak (AbuBakar et al. 2004; Arankalle et al. 2011; Chadha et al. 2006; Harcourt et al. 2005; Lo et al. 2012 ) and phylogenetic analysis indicated there are at least two distinct lineages of NiV circulating in Southeast Asia. Sequences obtained from Malaysia and Cambodia are designated as genotype M, while sequences obtained from Bangladesh and India are designated genotype B. Genotypes can be assigned based on the sequence of a 729 nucleotide window in the N-terminal region of the N gene ORF. Levels of nucleotide variation among full-length ORFs between genotypes M and B ranged from 6 to 9 % and between the complete genomes nucleotide variation is approximately 8 % . It is not clear if there are biologic differences between the genotypes and this question is the subject of ongoing investigation (Clayton et al. 2012; DeBuysscher et al. 2013 ).",

Ephrin-B3 serves as an alternative receptor for NiV, but not HeV (Negrete et al. 2006) . After receptor binding by the attachment protein, G, the fusion protein (F) which is cleaved to create two linked polypeptides, F 1 and F 2 , fuses to the host cell mem-brane, initiating endocytosis (Wang et al. 2001) . Following fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane, the viral ribonucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm (Lamb and Parks 2007) .

In a subset of 14 secondary patients who had well defined exposure to another case, the incubation period was 6-11 days (Luby et al. 2009b ). In humans, NiV causes acute febrile encephalitis including fever, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, myalgia, and vomiting with reduced consciousness and evidence of brainstem involvement being a poor prognostic factor. Some patients with NiV initially present with pulmonary symptoms such as cough, atypical pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. The percentage of NiV patients presenting with respiratory disease was higher in Bangladesh (69 %) than in Malaysia (25 %) (Luby et al. 2009b; Tee et al. 2009 ). Some NiV cases experienced relapse of disease or late onset encephalitis after initial infection, which occurred on average approximately 8 months after initial infection (range: 9 days-22 months) and both syndromes have similar clinical manifestations (Goh et al. 2000; Tan et al. 2002; Tyler 2009 ). Upon post mortem examination viral antigen was found in the brains of patients with relapse and late onset encephalitis indicating viral replication took place in these tissues. Unlike acute NiV encephalitis cases, relapse and late onset encephalitis cases did not show vasculitis in the CNS (Tan and Chua 2008; Tan et al. 2002; Tyler 2009) .

Molecular detection of viral genome is currently the central arm of henipavirus infection diagnosis.

Fortunately for horse owners and breeders, there have been no infections in this cohort to date. However, any horse which is infected with Hendra virus poses a serious threat to all who come in contact with the animal, and this includes dogs, cats, ferrets and possibly other animals. This situation prompted the development of a vaccine for horses which was released at the end of 2012 (Broder et al. 2013) . It remains to be seen what the uptake of this vaccine will be like, and how it will impact the epidemiology of the disease. A successful equine vaccination program has the potential to reverse the current trend of veterinarians exiting equine practice in HeV-endemic regions due to the perceived personal risk and workplace liability (Mendez et al. 2012) .",

Two recently published studies from Papua New Guinea identified an increased henipavirus seroprevalence from less than 10 % in the period 1996-1999 to 55 % in 2010, suggesting that the dynamics of HeV or NiV or another closely related virus is changing (Breed et al. 2010; Field et al. 2013) . Additional studies are needed to determine the ecologic, environmental and epidemiologic circumstances that favor transmission of NiV and HeV from their natural reservoir host to humans and other domestic species. Pteropid bat cell lines have recently been developed (Crameri et al. 2009 ) and future studies should help improve our understanding of how NiV and HeV persist in various bat species.",
