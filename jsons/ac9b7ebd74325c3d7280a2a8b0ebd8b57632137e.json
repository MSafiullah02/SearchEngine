It is an approved medicinal product in more than 50 countries for the treatment of airway infections such as acute bronchitis, common cold, and sinusitis. Purpose: While the pharmacological effects of EPs R 7630 have extensively been evaluated in diverse in vitro test systems, the number of publications reporting results from in vivo models is limited. Study design: In the present study antitussive, secretolytic, and anti-inflammatory effects of EPs R 7630 were assessed in animal experiments following oral administration at human equivalent doses. Methods: Antitussive effects were evaluated using ammonia-and citric acid-induced models of cough in mice (20, 40, 120 mg/kg) and guinea pigs (10, 20, 45 mg/kg), respectively. For the determination of secretolytic activity tracheobronchial secretion of intraperitoneally injected phenol red was determined in mice, while antiinflammatory action was assessed in an acute bacterial bronchitis model in rats. Results: A significant and dose-dependent reduction of cough frequency was observed in both cough models, which was accompanied by a prolongation of cough latency time. Similarly, the extract exerted a marked secretolytic activity in mice. Induction of acute bacterial bronchitis caused characteristic histopathological changes in lung tissue adjacent to trachea and bronchi. The degree of these lesions was significantly reduced in rats treated with EPs R 7630 at doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg. This protective effect at least partially seems to be mediated by an up-regulation of superoxide dismutase and a subsequent protective effect against oxidative stress as indicated by a reduced serum level of malondialdehyde. Conclusion: The present data further support the therapeutic use of EPs R 7630 in respiratory tract infections and provide a basis for detailed studies on its bioactive constituents as well as their in vivo mode of action.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In southern Africa, different indigenous species of the plant genus Pelargonium are used in folk medicine for the treatment of various complaints, such as diarrhea, dysentery, liver disorders and dysmenorrhea.

In vitro evaluation of pharmacological activities revealed among others mild to moderate direct antibacterial and antiviral properties, inhibition of bacterial adhesion on host cells as well as activation of the innate immune defense. This later action is mediated by stimulation of release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide, and interferon-beta, which are accompanied by an enhanced natural killer cell activity and an improved phagocytosis, oxidative burst and intracellular killing by human peripheral blood phagocytes. Besides, cytoprotective capabilities and an increase of ciliary beat frequency of nasal respiratory cells have been reported (Kolodziej 2011) .

In the majority of cases respiratory infections are caused by viruses (e.g. adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie viruses). They are usually self-limiting and in two thirds of cases will be cured within two weeks (Holzinger et al. 2014 ). Thus, relief of symptoms and shortening of disease duration is the primary aim of medicinal treatment. Viral infections of the respiratory tract (\"common cold\") are usually accompanied by an acute cough. Other symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, headache, growing pains, fatigue, and possibly fever. The transition from a common cold to an acute bronchitis is fluent. In the early stages of the inflammatory reaction patients are particularly afflicted by a dry cough. Following the release of inflammatory mediators or damage of the airway epithelium sensory nerves are activated which initializes the cough reflex. Although cough is normally a defensive reflex that keeps the respiratory tract free of obstructions and harmful substances it is non-productive at this stage as mucus secretion is not yet increased. Due to its pure force coughing bouts further irritate the already affected mucous membranes and induce a vicious circle. Thus, antitussive therapy is indicated at this phase of acute airway infections (Holzinger et al. 2014; Reynolds et al. 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 445, "end": 467, "text": "(Holzinger et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1517, "text": "(Holzinger et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1539, "text": "Reynolds et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although the beneficial therapeutic effects of EPs R 7630 in the treatment of respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated in a great number of randomized controlled clinical trials and are well supported by its until now described pharmacological profile, possible antitussive activity has not yet been investigated.

Protussive compounds improve the effectiveness of cough by improving the expectoration of airway secretion by increasing the volume of secretion (secretolytics), lowering the viscosity of mucus (mucolytics) or stimulation of mucociliary clearance by enhancing ciliary activity and mucin transport (secretomotorics).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 363, "end": 385, "text": "(Reynolds et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "With respect to citric acids-induced cough considerable similarity in conscious guinea pigs and men has been reported and a broad range of antitussive as well as protussive drugs have been observed to be active in this model, e.g. opioids, local anesthetics, histamine H1 receptor antagonists, 5-HT3 receptor agonists, \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists, antimuscarinics expectorants and mucolytics.

Previously, concern has been expressed that antitussive therapy should not be combined with the application of protussive drugs due to the possibility that excessive respiratory secretion may accumulate in the airways.

Although daily inhalation of unburned smoke over a period of 21 days in combination with weekly intranasal applications of Streptococcus pneumoniae had no effect on the number of leucocytes and the protein content in the bronchoalveolar lavage, histopathological examination clearly demonstrated an ongoing inflammatory reaction. These pathological changes were dosedependently reduced around the tracheae of treated animals when compared with the model control group while a significant effect on bronchial histopathology was only seen at a dose of 30 mg/kg. This protective effect at least partially seems to be mediated by an up regulation of SOD and a subsequent protective effect against oxidative stress as indicated by a reduced serum level of MDA. A wide selection of compounds has been isolated and identified in EPs R 7630 . Characteristic constituents of the extract are highly oxygenated coumarins, simple phenols (e.g., catechin, gallocatechin) and high molecular weight proanthocyanidins. In general, the coumarins and polymeric polyphenols are described as the main pharmacologically active agents in EPs (Kolodziej 2007 (Kolodziej , 2011 . However, due to their high degree of polymerization it has been questioned if the proanthocyanidins may at all contribute to the pharmacological action of EPs R 7630 after oral administration (Kolodziej 2007) . Thus, the present experiments were designed to investigate antitussive, secretolytic and antiinflammatory effects of EPs R 7630 in animal experiments following oral administration of human equivalent doses. The now generated data definitely support the oral therapeutic use of EPs R 7630 in respiratory tract infections and provide a basis for further studies on its bioactive constituents as well as their in vivo mode of action.
