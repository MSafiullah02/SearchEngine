            "text": "Poult enteritis complex has been associated with enteritis and reduction in growth rates in commercial turkeys worldwide. Intestinal samples from 76 turkey flocks from different Brazilian states affected or not with intestinal disorders were evaluated for the presence of adenovirus groups 1 and 2 (TAV), astrovirus types 1 and 2 (TAstV-1 and TAstV-2), turkey coronavirus (TCoV), reovirus, rotavirus, and avian nephritis virus (ANV) using PCR. The percentage of positive samples was categorized according to the geographic origin, age of the flocks, and presence of clinical signs of intestinal disease. The percentage of samples that were positive for at least one virus was 93.4%, whereas the percentage of samples that were positive for more than one virus was 69.7%. An average of 3.20 viruses per sample was detected in turkeys in the growing phase of the production cycle (1 to 4 wk of age). The TAstV-1 and TCoV were the most frequently observed viruses in growing phase turkeys and occurred simultaneously in 85% of these samples. In turkeys in the finishing phase of development (5 to 18 wk), a lower average number of viruses was observed (2.41), and the most frequent viruses isolated in these turkeys were TAstV-1 (57.1%) and rotavirus (51.8%). Overall, every virus was detected more frequently in growing phase turkeys than in finishing phase turkeys with the exception of TAV. Samples from flocks exhibiting clinical signs of intestinal disease showed a higher rate of positivity, and TAstV-1, TAstV-2, and TCoV were the most frequently occurring viruses in this cohort. Birds without clinical signs most frequently harbored TAstV-1 and rotavirus. Future studies should focus on the description and elucidation of the role of each virus, as well as the pathogenic and immunological implications of the different combinations of viruses in turkeys.",

            "text": "Enteric disorders that affect turkey flocks were first reported by Pomeroy and Fenstermacher (1937) in the form of hemorrhagic enteritis. In the 1950s, an enteric disease called bluecomb disease was widely reported (Peterson and Hymas, 1951; Pomeroy and Sieburth, 1953; Sieburth and Johnson, 1957) . Clear observation of an etiological agent was first done by Fujisaki et al. (1969) , who demonstrated the presence of reoviruses in the feces of affected poults using electron microscopy. In the subsequent 10 yr, adenoviruses, astroviruses, coronaviruses, picornaviruses, and rotaviruses were also observed in the intestinal contents of diarrheic turkeys using electron microscopy (Panigrahy et al., 1973; Carlson et al., 1974; Tolin and Domermuth, 1975; Bergeland et al., 1977; Imada et al., 1979; McNulty et al., 1980) . Several studies have revealed the occurrence of multiple turkey infections by adenovirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, reovirus, and rotavirus, which produce different clinical manifestations depending on whether they occur as single or multiple infections (Reynolds et al., 1987a; Sellers et al., 2004; Day et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a; Saif, 2008; Jindal et al., 2010a) .",

The high rate of virus detection most likely reflects a greater susceptibility of this population of turkeys to enteric viruses during the first weeks of development due to an immature intestinal epithelium (Reynolds et al., 1987a; Ismail et al., 2003; Saif, 2008; Jindal et al., 2009a) . Epithelial maturation occurs when the intestinal lining of young poults, which, at the nascent stages of development, is accustomed to digesting lipid-and proteinrich yolk, transition to digesting commercial feed rich in carbohydrates, lipids, and protein (Uni, 2006) . Uni et al. (1995 Uni et al. ( , 1999 demonstrated that the introduction of the commercial diet causes an increase in the number and length of villi. Upon exposure to commercial feed, the duodenum develops by d 7 posthatch, and the jejunum and the ileum develop by d 14 posthatch. At the cellular level during intestinal development, functional enterocytes replace proliferative enterocytes that com- prise the villi, gradually restricting the actively proliferating area on the intestinal crypts (Uni et al., 1998) . In our study, the high frequency (81.6%) of viruses from the astrovirus family (TAstV-1, TAstV-2, or ANV) parallels observations of the frequency of astroviruses in turkey intestinal samples in the United States, in which astroviruses have been reported in 89.5 and 100% of the samples analyzed , 2008a . Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2008a) showed that TAstV-2 occurred more frequently than TAstV-1, which was also reported by Jindal et al. (2010b) . In contrast, our study found a higher frequency of TAstV-1 than TAstV-2. Our study also revealed the presence of ANV (35.5%), which has been found in turkey flocks (12.5%) by Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2008a) .",

This finding is likely due to the immature intestinal epithelium present in the growing phase turkeys, which harbors a more immature mucosal immune system. Beal et al. (2006) have suggested that the intestinal defense against enteric pathogen colonization depends on the complete development of the gastrointestinal-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT). Furthermore, Befus et al. (1980) have shown that Peyer's patches, which comprise part of the GALT, develop fully by wk 16. Bar-Shira et al. (2003) also demonstrated that an adaptive immune response begins by wk 2 of development, and soon after d 17 of development, lymphocytes appear within the lamina propria and reach a maximum concentration by wk 8 (Yason et al., 1987; Vervelde and Jeurissen, 1993) . Therefore, early in the development of turkeys, there are no bacterial microbiota in poult intestines to protect from external pathogen colonization (Nurmi and Rantala, 1973) .",

Yason and Schat (1986) demonstrated that turkeys inoculated with rotavirus resulted in diarrhea but not mortality, suggesting that other infectious agents might synergize with the rotavirus infection to exacerbate intestinal disease. Several studies have suggested that a coinfection with astrovirus and rotavirus, a commonly detected coinfection in our study, is important for the development of enteritis in poults (Reynolds et al., 1987a,b) . However, Jindal et al. (2010a) demonstrated that a coinfection with TAstV-2 and rotavirus is not sufficient to cause enteric syndromes in turkeys regardless of age, which suggests that an initiating agent is necessary for the development of enteritis. Virus-specific antibodies have been shown to control different viral infections in older turkeys as demonstrated by Mukiibi-Muka and Jones (1999) , who showed that a specific IgA response against reovirus could be detected in the intestines of birds as young as 3 wk of age.",

(2010a) that revealed the presence of reovirus in 10.4% of flocks that did not show signs of intestinal disease. However, Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2007) did not detect reovirus in poults that did not show signs of intestinal disease. Jindal et al. (2010b) showed that reovirus occurs in 45.5% of turkeys that come from flocks that display poult enteritis syndrome. Similarly to a report by Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2008a) , reovirus was never found as a single-agent infection. The exact role that reovirus infection plays during enteric syndromes is not completely understood; however, reovirus has been directly observed by electron microscopy in flocks with poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (Deshmukh et al., 1969; Wooley and Gratzek, 1969) . At least one virus was detected within flocks that presented clinical signs of enteritis, with the most frequently observed number of distinct viruses ranging from 3 to 4. This observation has been reported by Jindal et al. (2010b) , who showed that most of the intestinal samples from flocks affected with poult enteritis syndrome were simultaneously positive for between 2 and 3 other viruses. Our results also demonstrated viral intestinal colonization in birds that did not display signs of intestinal disease (23 of 28 samples), which is consistent with several previous studies (Reynolds et al., 1987a; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a; Jindal et al., 2010a) . However, the rate of coinfection in turkeys with no signs of intestinal disease occurred at a much lower rate than turkeys that displayed signs of intestinal disease. Almost half of the samples from turkeys without intestinal disease had single virus infections (11 of 23 positive samples). Both of these findings were demonstrated by Jindal et al. (2010a) , who, despite only studying coinfections among TAstV-2, TCoV, reovirus, and rotavirus, suggested that viral coinfection may be relevant in the development and intensification of intestinal disease.",

Moreover, correlations have not been established between age or the presence of intestinal disease and single and multiple infections by TAV, HEV, TAstV-1, TAstV-2, TCoV, reovirus, and rotavirus. Molecular methods of virus detection such as genome sequencing are more specific and sensitive diagnostic methods, and they have effectively supplanted traditional methods such as electron microscopy (Jindal et al., 2010b) . In this study, we successfully used PCR and RT-PCR to identify the presence of specific virus families within intestinal samples (Hess et al., 1999; Koci et al., 2000a; Cavanagh et al., 2002; Alvarado et al., 2007; Day et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a) . Recently, metagenomic studies have been used for the establishment of the intestinal DNA profile of enteric pathogens and microbiota (Day et al., 2010) .",
