As a carrier of high-energy electrons from fuel oxidation (in its reduced form, NADH), NAD+ is an essential cofactor for redox reactions in the cytosol and mitochondria. These redox reactions are critical in enabling the most basic function of the cell, namely, the harvesting of energy in the form of ATP from fuel substrates such as glucose, amino acids and fatty acids. Without NAD+, fuel cannot be converted into energy. As a substrate for major classes of enzymes such as sirtuins that cleave a carbon\u2013nitrogen bond in NAD+ to yield nicotinamide (Nam; also known as niacinamide) and ADP-ribose (ADPR), NAD+ also regulates a variety of other cellular processes, including the cellular stress response, mitochondrial homeostasis and calcium signalling.",

In this context, NAD+ has been most extensively investigated as a substrate for sirtuins, which act in the nucleus, cytosol and mitochondria to deacetylate or deacylate target proteins, including DNA histones, DNA repair enzymes and transcriptional regulators of metabolism. Over the past 3 years, data from experimental models and clinical studies have also implicated NAD+ homeostasis as a determinant of kidney health and of the ability of the renal tubule to resist varied stressors. Here, we review fundamental aspects of NAD+ biology and discuss evidence for a role of NAD+ imbalance in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Finally, we propose that disruption of NAD+ metabolism may contribute to mechanistic links among AKI, CKD and ageing.",

These reactions result in a continuous redox cycle of reduction to NADH and oxidation back to NAD+. This NAD+ recycling is required for the continuous flow of electrons across intermediary metabolism, including the oxidation of fuel substrates via glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle and Krebs cycle) and \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids. For example, the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in glycolysis is coupled to the reduction of cytosolic NAD+ to NADH. The oxidized form, NAD+, must be regenerated and available for subsequent reactions. Under aerobic conditions, the transfer of electrons into mitochondria via the malate\u2013aspartate shuttle or glycerol-3\u2013phosphate shuttle, and subsequently to the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), regenerates cytosolic NAD+. Mitochondrial NADH produced during the TCA cycle and \u03b2-oxidation can donate electrons directly to the ETC. When mitochondrial respiration is impaired, the cytosolic reduction of pyruvate to lactate regenerates NAD+ to permit ongoing glycolysis.",

Nam is the precursor of the salvage pathway2,3, the name of which relates to Nam being the product of NAD+ consumption reactions. NR flows into the salvage pathway and both Nam and NR are converted to the penultimate product of this pathway, NMN, which may also be directly absorbed from the gut4. Niacin is the precursor in the Preiss\u2013Handler pathway. The redundancy in these biosynthetic pathways is illustrated by pellagra, which is caused by a lack of niacin that results in NAD+ deficiency. Pellagra classically leads to diarrhoea, dermatitis, dementia and, in severe cases, death. Adequate dietary intake of either tryptophan or niacin is sufficient to prevent this disease5.",

However, radioisotope studies conducted in the 1970s showed that Nam was the major NAD+ precursor in the mouse liver7. In 2018, a quantitative analysis of NAD+ synthesis and breakdown in mice that used flux studies and mathematical modelling reported that the oral bioavailability of exogenous Nam was greater than that of NR and NMN; however, the de novo pathway from tryptophan substantially contributed to baseline NAD+ production in the liver and kidney8. Another study suggested that NR was more effective at increasing intracellular NAD+ levels than Nam or nicotinic acid9. Moreover, a pilot trial showed that NR supplementation increased NAD+ levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy adults10. Among these NAD+ precursors, only the ingestion of niacin is associated with a transient vasodilatory flushing reaction11.",

            "text": "Sirtuins are a family of proteins that are evolutionarily conserved from yeast. Seven different sirtuins have been identified in mammals, each with distinct cellular localization and function. For example, SIRT1 is primarily located in the nucleus where it is associated with euchromatin, whereas SIRT3\u20135 are primarily mitochondrial12. Sirtuins are involved in many reactions that regulate cellular metabolism through the NAD+-dependent deacetylation or deacylation of proteins including histones, such as H3, H4 and H1, transcription factors and co-activators, including p53, NF-\u03baB, PPAR\u03b3 co-activator 1\u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1) and FOXO1, and signalling regulators of metabolism, including protein kinase A, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)13. Sirtuins also utilize NAD+ to remove other kinds of post-translational protein modifications, including malonylation and succinylation. In all of these reactions, the ADPR generated from NAD+ becomes an acceptor for the post-translational group removed from the target protein. For example, during the deacetylation of histones, SIRT1 transfers the acetyl group from key lysine residues of the histone protein to ADPR. Sirtuin activity is increased with caloric restriction and has been associated with increased longevity and/or health in yeast, worms, flies and mice14\u201317; however, these links have been questioned, as other studies have reported that lifespan extension in yeast, worms and flies may be sirtuin-independent18.",

Despite this short half-life, the intracellular concentration of NAD+ is thought to remain fairly constant in healthy states, varying only a few-fold with changes in metabolic activity24. Elegant studies using a NAD+ biosensor showed that NAD+ concentration varies substantially between different intracellular compartments23. The cytoplasm and nucleus of HEK293T cells had free NAD+ concentrations of approximately 100 \u03bcM, which was approximately half that of mitochondria. These three pools of NAD+ may be connected, although a mammalian intracellular NAD+ transporter has not yet been identified23. If NAD+ concentrations are regulated in a compartment-specific manner, this regulation could have an impact on the redox function to generate ATP as well as the substrate function for NAD+-consuming enzymes. For example, a reduction in the level of PARP1, which is predominantly localized in the nucleus, markedly increased the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of NAD+, without altering mitochondrial NAD+ levels or the activity of mitochondrial SIRT3 (ref.25).",

Systemic administration of a benzamide-based PARP inhibitor after reperfusion increased renal levels of ATP, reduced histopathological evidence of tubular damage and improved renal function in these rats. Consistent with these findings, Parp1-knockout mice were more resistant to renal IRI than wild-type controls44. Subsequent studies showed that a PARP1 inhibitor preserved renal blood flow in a rat model of ventilator-induced lung injury45 and that intravenous benzamide administration prevented a decline in renal blood flow in dogs subjected to endotoxaemic shock43. A study published in abstract form also reported beneficial effects of a novel PARP1 inhibitor in a rat model of renal IRI46. Taken together, these results implicate accelerated NAD+ consumption owing to induction of PARPs in the development of AKI. Several PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, rucaparib and talazoparib, have been FDA-approved for the treatment of BRCA-related breast and ovarian cancer, making PARP inhibition tractable for clinical evaluation in AKI.",

In cultured renal tubular cells, overexpression of PGC1\u03b1 protected against oxidant stress48. Our research group found that mice with global or tubule-specific knockout of the gene encoding PGC1\u03b1 exhibited blunted recovery and worse renal injury following endotoxaemia, systemic cisplatin treatment or bilateral renal IRI compared with wild-type controls47,49,50. Conversely, mice with tubule-specific overexpression of PGC1\u03b1 were protected against all three models of AKI47,49,50. The PPARGC1A locus, which encodes PGC1\u03b1, contains an evolutionarily conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5\u2032 untranslated region51. Such uORFs reduce protein expression by suppressing translation52. Using CRISPR\u2013Cas9, we mutated the start codon of the Ppargc1a uORF to create a transgenic mouse with global overexpression of PGC1\u03b1 and showed that this mouse was protected against renal IRI51. The available data obtained using gain-of-function and loss-of-function mice in distinct models of AKI indicate that PGC1\u03b1 may be a common and conserved determinant of the injury response of tubular cells to many different stressors.",

We found that IRI suppressed the renal expression of enzymes in the de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway and was associated with reduced levels of Nam and NAD+. Ppargc1a-knockout mice, which exhibited increased sensitivity to IRI, had basal reductions in the expression of de novo NAD+ biosynthesis enzymes and in the renal levels of Nam and NAD+. Conversely, mice with gain of function of PGC1\u03b1, which developed less severe AKI and recovered more quickly following IRI than littermate controls, showed a basal induction of the de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway and elevated renal levels of Nam and NAD+ compared with these controls. Notably, renal tubular PGC1\u03b1 overexpression did not modulate expression of PARPs, sirtuins, cADPR synthetases or key enzymes in other NAD+ biosynthetic pathways. These results demonstrate that PGC1\u03b1 in the renal tubule coordinates the biosynthesis of NAD+ through the de novo pathway. Considered in the context of earlier results showing that NAD+ can post-translationally activate PGC1\u03b153, the findings suggest that PGC1\u03b1 and NAD+ might reciprocally regulate each other.",

Unlike upstream metabolites in the de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway, the only known function of quinolinic acid is to serve as a precursor for NAD+ (Fig. 4). Accumulation of quinolinic acid in the post-ischaemic urine suggested a reduction in the levels of the enzyme that utilizes this substrate, QPRT. As predicted by the metabolomics findings and reported in a previous study47, the renal expression of QPRT was reduced in post-ischaemic kidneys. Compared with wild-type littermates, mice that were heterozygous for QPRT recapitulated nearly half of the AKI urinary metabolomic pattern, even in the absence of AKI. QPRT heterozygous mice were more susceptible to renal IRI than wild-type littermate controls; however, this increased susceptibility was abrogated by augmenting NAD+ biosynthesis via the salvage pathway using exogenous Nam. These results suggest that AKI-induced suppression of QPRT might be a pathogenic event in AKI that can be addressed by orthogonal replenishment of NAD+.",

Compared with wild-type littermates, we found that mice with renal PGC1\u03b1 overexpression had higher levels of the FAO product \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, which in turn signalled increased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a known renal vasodilator62. This finding suggests that substrates of fuel oxidation in the epithelial compartment enable the vasculature to regulate blood flow in order to maintain adequate oxygen delivery. Lipidomic analysis showed that AKI-induced lipid accumulation is characterized by a striking enrichment of diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols high in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content. The >50\u2013100-fold elevations of these PUFA-rich lipid species are greatly out of proportion compared with total lipid accumulation, suggesting that, in addition to blocking their consumption via FAO, AKI might also increase their synthesis. A subsequent study showed that an increase in lipid desaturation may be an adaptive response to the reduced NAD+:NADH ratio in AKI, providing a mechanism for NAD+ recycling when tubular mitochondrial respiration is impaired (Fig. 5). For example, the addition of a desaturase inhibitor further lowered the NAD+:NADH ratio and worsened AKI in mice treated with a mitochondrial toxin63. In our study, administration of Nam not only fortified renal NAD+ but also reduced AKI-associated accumulation of fats (including PUFA-rich diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols) and AKI severity in two distinct models: IRI and cisplatin nephrotoxicity47. These findings suggest that reduced NAD+ levels in various types of renal injury might result in impairment of normal tubular function, but might be amenable to therapeutic augmentation.",

We found that treatment with NMN preserved mitophagy and enhanced lysosomal disposal of injured mitochondria in cisplatin-treated tubular cells and in a mouse model of cisplatin nephrotoxicity49. PGC1\u03b1 and NAD+ are upstream inducers of transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis65,66. Administration of NAD+ precursors (Nam or NMN) may therefore not only enable efficient ATP generation via FAO but also promote mitochondrial quality control by coordinating the safe disposal of injured, pro-oxidative mitochondria in lysosomes. Indeed, earlier work showed that another cytoprotective sirtuin enzyme, SIRT3, utilizes NAD+ to prevent mitochondrial fragmentation and protect renal function in the setting of cisplatin exposure67.

Our subsequent pilot study examined the relationship between PGC1\u03b1 expression in renal allografts from deceased donors and delayed graft function (DGF)71. In deceased-donor kidney transplants, periods of warm and cold ischaemia prior to implantation are thought to contribute to clinical IRI. Although the majority of deceased-donor grafts produce sufficient renal clearance for the recipient to cease dialysis within the first 48 h post-transplantation, recipients with DGF may require dialysis for several weeks. In this setting, allograft biopsies are often performed postoperatively to rule out acute rejection. In a small cohort of decreased-donor transplant recipients who had DGF without acute rejection, we found that allograft biopsy samples obtained within 30 days post-transplantation exhibited a large spread of PGC1\u03b1 expression in morphologically intact tubules. Biopsy samples that had the lowest PGC1\u03b1 expression were associated with an additional 2 weeks of dialysis compared with those with the highest PGC1\u03b1 expression71.

There was no difference between either dose of Nam and placebo in terms of safety. The pharmacokinetics of Nam were consistent with a water-soluble vitamin, demonstrating clearance in the urine, and evidence of conversion of Nam to NAD+ was ascertained. Finally, serial measurements of serum creatinine levels suggested a potential renal benefit of Nam administration. As only 41 patients completed the trial, these encouraging results require further testing in larger, multicentre studies.",

Furthermore, knockdown of the KMO orthologue in zebrafish and knockout of Kmo in mice led to a spontaneous proteinuria phenotype57. Although renal KMO expression was more abundant in the tubules than in the glomeruli, the renal histological abnormalities were confined to the glomerulus in both model organisms. The zebrafish KMO knockdown showed pronounced podocyte foot process effacement, whereas the mouse Kmo knockout showed mild foot process effacement. As podocytes are affected in many CKD syndromes, these results suggest an involvement of de novo NAD+ biosynthesis in CKD. Spontaneous proteinuria was not, however, observed in an independently generated Kmo-knockout mouse model55. These results suggest the need to investigate the contribution of KMO to podocyte function more closely, perhaps with evaluation of podocyte versus tubular-specific knockout mice.",

Furthermore, culturing proximal tubular cells in high glucose resulted in lower levels of NMN and NAD+ relative to normal glucose conditions.

In this model, treatment with an AMPK activator increased PGC1\u03b1 expression, reduced the levels of glomerular fibronectin and TGF\u03b2 and reduced albuminuria. The long non-coding RNA Tug1 may also modulate PGC1\u03b1 expression in experimental diabetes. Podocyte-specific overexpression of Tug1 increased the expression of PGC1\u03b1 and its transcriptional targets and improved the histological features of diabetic nephropathy in a db/db model79. However, the results of another study suggest that supranormal PGC1\u03b1 induction in the podocyte could promote a collapsing glomerulopathy marked by severe proteinuria and progressive renal failure80. However, overexpression of PGC1\u03b1 in the podocyte, a cell type that normally expresses very little PGC1\u03b1 relative to the cortical renal tubular epithelium50, seems to have fundamentally altered its normal fuel metabolism, shifting it from normal glucose consumption towards FAO80.

Echoing findings in experimental AKI60,61, lower expression of these genes was associated with higher lipid accumulation in the tubular epithelium. The researchers also used folic acid to induce tubulointerstitial fibrosis in mice and found that transgenic expression of PGC1\u03b1 in the renal tubular epithelium restored the expression of FAO genes, reduced expression of profibrotic molecules and improved renal histology. A related study from the same group showed that distal tubular deletion of the gene encoding LKB1, an upstream kinase that activates AMPK, was associated with decreased expression of AMPK and PGC1\u03b1 and resulted in progressive kidney disease in mice82. LKB1-deficient cells were characterized by energy depletion, reduced FAO and a profibrotic phenotype; treatment with an AMPK agonist ameliorated these effects. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that metabolic dysfunction might be a common characteristic that links AKI and CKD. Whether increasing PGC1\u03b1 expression either directly or via AMPK or Tug1 in CKD models is associated with changes in kidney NAD+ levels has not yet been reported.

Age >65 years has been associated with non-recovery from AKI and progression to moderate or severe CKD following AKI92\u201394. Kidney function declines with ageing, even among healthy populations95\u201397, and whether this age-related loss of kidney function should be classified as CKD \u2014 as is currently the case \u2014 remains a subject of debate98. NAD+ augmentation is an attractive therapeutic strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of ageing on cellular metabolism88. Although little is known about the relationship between declining NAD+ levels and CKD, it is plausible that augmentation of NAD+ may also have a therapeutic role in slowing CKD progression. More work is needed to develop methods that can interrogate NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, their respective precursors and their intermediates in kidney tissue to understand how NAD+ metabolism is impacted by ageing, both in experimental organisms and in humans99.",

A body of research dating back nearly 20 years has identified NAD+ as a determinant of ageing in experimental organisms; however, translating knowledge of NAD+ biology into medical applications is challenging. As a highly metabolically active organ with a clear age-related phenotype, the kidney has emerged as an intriguing physiological system in which to study the consequences of NAD+ biology. In tubular epithelial cells, NAD+ facilitates the high demand for electron transport that transforms fatty acid fuel into ATP. Experimental AKI of various aetiologies is characterized by a common, rapid decrease in renal NAD+ that is driven in part by impaired biosynthesis from tryptophan. Augmentation of NAD+ enhances FAO and broad cell-regulatory signalling networks that protect oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial health. Together, these actions may protect stressed renal tubular cells from death. Human AKI also seems to be characterized by a deficit in de novo NAD+ biosynthesis, raising the possibility of therapeutic NAD+ augmentation using vitamin B3 analogues. Future studies are needed to understand the mechanistic links among ageing, CKD and AKI. Study of NAD+ in the kidney may also yield insights that are applicable to other metabolically active organs, such as the heart and brain. In addition, translational studies that assess and modulate NAD+ metabolism may lead to new avenues for the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention and treatment of diseases of the kidney and other organs.",

Addition of a hydride ion (H-) (an electron pair) to NAD+ yields its reduced form, NADH. Reduction of NAD+ to NADH is required for glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle and Krebs cycle). Oxidation of NADH (donation of the electron pair) moves high-energy electrons from fuel substrates to Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Sequential oxidation\u2013reduction reactions in the ETC generate a proton motive force that is utilized by mitochondrial ATP synthase to generate ATP (not shown). Oxidation of NADH is also required to generate lactic acid from pyruvate and for the desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). NAD+ can also be phosphorylated to form NADP+. Oxidation\u2013reduction reactions involving NADP+ and its reduced form, NADPH, facilitate defence against oxidative stress by serving as a cofactor for thioredoxin-dependent reduction of disulfides and as a cofactor for glutathione reductase, which reduces the disulfide form of glutathione to its antioxidant sulfhydryl form. Reduction of NADP+ also occurs in the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates chemical building blocks for sugars and nucleic acids. NADPH serves as a substrate for NADPH oxidase enzymes (NOXs) that create second messengers of free radicals. NAD+ can also be cleaved by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), sirtuins and the cyclic ADP-ribose (ADPR) synthetases CD38 and CD157 to generate nicotinamide (Nam) and ADPR.",

The de novo pathway converts tryptophan to NAD+ via a series of enzymatic steps. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyses the first step in this pathway, the conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine (not shown). Quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) catalyses the conversion of quinolinic acid to nicotinate mononucleotide (NAMN). This bottleneck step commits the pathway to NAD+ synthesis. The Preiss\u2013Handler pathway converts the acid form of vitamin B3, nicotinic acid (also known as niacin), to NAMN. This conversion is catalysed by nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT). NAMN is converted to NAD+ by the sequential action of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs) and NAD synthetase (NADSYN). The salvage pathway converts the base analogue of vitamin B3, nicotinamide (Nam; also known as niacinamide), to NAD+ via the rate-limiting enzyme Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Nam mononucleotide (NMN) is a measurable intermediate in this pathway that can also be obtained through supplements and synthesized from the dietary precursor nicotinamide riboside. The salvage pathway is so named because NAD+ is \u2018reclaimed\u2019 from the Nam product of enzymes that consume NAD+ to generate ADP-ribose (ADPR) or cyclic ADPR (cADPR). NAD+ is converted to NAD+ phosphate (NADP+) by NAD+ kinases (NADKs). Hydride transfer from NADH to NADP+ by nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) also generates NADPH.

Tryptophan has multiple metabolic fates that compete with its conversion to N-formylkynurenine, which is catalysed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or Trp 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO)110. N-formylkynurenine is hydrolysed to kynurenine by arylformamidase (AFMID). Kynurenine is hydroxylated to 3-hydroxy-kynurenine by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). 3-Hydroxy-kynurenine is a major branch point in the pathway as this metabolite can be converted to xanthurenate or other molecules. Kynureninase (KYNU) catalyses the formation of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, which is converted to \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-carboxymuconate-\u03b5-semialdehyde (ACMS) by 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO). ACMS can either spontaneously cyclize to form quinolinic acid or can be decarboxylated by ACMS decarboxylase (ACMSD) to form picolinic acid. The only known fate of quinolinic acid is conversion to nicotinate mononucleotide (NAMN) by quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT). Quinolinic acid is therefore the first metabolite in the pathway that is committed to NAD+ biosynthesis.

During acute kidney injury (AKI), mitochondrial respiration and function are impaired, glycolysis increases to meet cellular energy demands and cytosolic NAD+ recycling is required. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which converts pyruvate to lactate, has a major role in cytosolic NAD+ recycling. Desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to form highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) is an additional mechanism of glycolytic NAD+ recycling that is mediated by delta-5 and delta-6 fatty acid desaturases (D5D and D6D). D5D and D6D are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and have cytosol-facing catalytic domains; they are highly expressed in the kidney and liver.

In healthy renal tubular epithelial cells, this ATP is utilized to provide the energy required for key functions, such as solute transport and maintenance of membrane integrity. Efficient FAO also prevents the potentially toxic accumulation of storage fats. NAD+ might also exert renoprotective effects via its interactions with sirtuins and PPAR\u03b3 co-activator 1\u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1). Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activates PGC1\u03b1 via NAD+-dependent deacetylation and PGC1\u03b1 in turn promotes NAD+ biosynthesis via the de novo pathway by co-ordinately upregulating the expression of the genes encoding enzymes in this pathway. PGC1\u03b1 promotes mitochondrial quality control and ATP production via interrelated process that include mitochondrial biogenesis and the induction of mitophagy via transcription factor EB (TFEB). SIRT3 also utilizes NAD+ to directly promote healthy mitochondrial function and SIRT1 may limit stress signalling through the pro-apoptotic Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. In addition to its effects on mitochondria, PGC1\u03b1 signalling can induce the production of vascular trophic molecules, such as VEGF. In tubular epithelial cells, a PGC1\u03b1-dependent product of FAO, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (\u03b2-OHB), may signal the production of vasodilator prostaglandins that can maintain renal blood flow during conditions such as shock that would otherwise promote renal ischaemia.
