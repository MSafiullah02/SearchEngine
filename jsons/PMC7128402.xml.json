The sequestration of mRNAs into these translationally-stalled cytoplasmic foci results from the rapid redirection of translation from housekeeping proteins to heat-shock proteins and other stress response factors. Upon detection of stress conditions, housekeeping mRNAs are triaged into SGs to conserve metabolic energy and to allow newly transcribed mRNAs for stress response factors to be efficiently translated.",

            "text": "Translation initiation under normal conditions requires the concerted activity of many cellular proteins known as eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). In brief, translation is enhanced when capped mRNAs are circularized by the cap-binding complex (eIF4F) and PABP, promoting their recruitment to the eIF3/40S ribosomal subunit complex. Subsequent recruitment of the 60S subunit and translation initiation at an AUG codon requires the ternary complex of eIF2, GTP and the methionyl initiator tRNA (eIF2\u2013GTP\u2013tRNAiMet). SGs are formed when translation is blocked at the initiation stage by a number of different conditions [3], for example, inhibition of eIF4F activity or by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which reduces the levels of eIF2\u2013GTP\u2013tRNAiMet. When initiation is stalled, RNA binding proteins such as TIA-1 and TIAR can bind to the abortive complexes and relocalize them to form SGs [3]. When initiation factors become available again, for example when stress is relieved, SGs are disassembled as translation resumes. Assembly of the granules is also dependent on the Ras-GAP SH3 domain binding proteins 1 and 2 (collectively referred to as G3BP) [4]. G3BP proteins contain a nuclear transport factor-2 (NTF2)-like domain and the N-terminus and RNA binding domains closer to the C-terminus, both of which are necessary for SG formation [4]. The NTF2-like domain binds a number of partners, such as USP10 and CAPRIN-1, and also mediates dimerization. The ability of G3BP to nucleate SGs is regulated by phosphorylation of serine 149 [4]. CAPRIN-1 is necessary for normal progression through the G1-S cell cycle restriction point [5] and ubiquitin specific protease 10 (USP10) promotes the stability of a number of important proteins, including p53 [6]. Complexes containing G3BP and its many binding partners are thus involved in numerous cellular processes and likely involved in many signaling pathways [7].",

Virus replication alters the cellular environment in ways that promote viral genome replication, transcription, particle assembly and immune evasion. Often, cellular proteins are sequestered by viral factors and reassigned to functions that support rather than inhibit virus replication. SG proteins are no exception to this, with several examples of these proteins being co-opted by viruses to their own ends [13], [15], [16], [17], [18]. With this in mind, investigators need to concurrently use more than one marker to distinguish SGs from other foci, such as of accumulation of viral proteins with their cellular binding partners. It is advisable to double- or triple-stain with an SG marker such as TIA-1/R OR G3BP-1/2 in addition to an initiation complex protein such as eIF3, eIF4G or PABP. The dissolution of SGs by cycloheximide or emetine treatment can also be used to distinguish bona fide SGs from other foci of protein accumulation [19].",

            "text": "A common strategy for demonstrating viral inhibition of SG assembly has been to challenge virus-infected cells with an exogenous stress inducer, such as sodium arsenite (SA) to determine if virus-encoded factors act to block the induction of SGs by the exogenous inducer. SA activates the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, which phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, in turn inducing SGs [20], [21]. However, this approach is complicated by the activation of another eIF2\u03b1 kinase (PKR), triggered by diverse virus infections. In cells infected with viruses that induce phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, the addition of arsenite is redundant and does not lead to formation of SGs in infected cells, even if there is no virus-encoded mechanism to block their formation. For example, in SFV-infected cells, PKR becomes activated early in infection by the presence of dsRNA replication intermediates. Despite the consequent high and sustained levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, translation of the viral sub-genomic mRNA is efficient due to the presence of a translational enhancer in the capsid coding region [9]. To avoid this complication, researchers should consider using a phospho-eIF2\u03b1-independent SG inducer (see Table 1\n), such as pateamine A (Pat A, [22]) or hippuristanol [23], which inhibit the RNA helicase eIF4A, a component of the eIF4F complex, leading to SG formation independently of eIF2\u03b1 Cells infected with WT SFV do not form SGs in response to either SA or Pat A, but a mutant which does not inhibit SG formation does form SGs in response to 50 nM Pat A, but not to SA [15].",

An alternative, more sensitive method for confirming functional colocalization of two proteins is the proximity ligation assay (available in a kit from Sigma, \u201cDuolink using PLA technology\u201d), which has been used to demonstrate the localization of PKR and G3BP in poliovirus induced SGs [29].",

Puromycin is a broadly-acting antibiotic which blocks translation by entering the A site of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes, and is itself transferred to the growing polypeptide chain, causing the disassembly of polysomes and release of the truncated polypeptide containing puromycin instead of a normal amino acid at its C-terminus. Treatment of cells for very short times with 10 \u03bcg/ml puromycin leads to cessation of translation and the release of the puromycinylated nascent chains from polysomes. David and colleagues showed that a puromycin-specific antibody could be used with immunofluorescence microscopy to detect puromycinylated proteins and thus to determine the relative levels and distribution of translation in cells [40]. While other in vivo protein labeling techniques (notably, incorporation of azido-modified amino acid analogs, e.g. Invitrogen \u201cclick-it\u201d chemicals) can be used to label and detect protein translation in situ, they require prestarving the cells in methionine-free media, which may perturb normal infection kinetics and other aspects of metabolism. Puromycin labeling has several advantages: it is compatible with a broad range of drugs (including SA and Pat A), it is very quick, and compatible with immunostaining for other SG markers.",

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were infected with wt SFV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. At various times post infection, 10 \u03bcg/mL puromycin was added to the media for 5 min immediately prior to fixation and staining for nsP3, TIA-1 and puromycin. Representative images are presented in Fig. 1\n. In mock-infected cells, TIA-1 is predominantly located in the nucleus, while the puromycin signal is strong and not located in any specific cytoplasmic compartment. As we have described before, at approximately 2\u20134 hpi, TIA-1 translocates to the cytoplasm and is transiently detected in SGs. However, in region of the cytoplasm where viral protein or RNA is detected, SGs are no longer visible [9]. At this point, the total translation rate in the infected cell is drastically reduced as compared to mock-infected cells. Later, as the SGs are entirely disassembled and viral RCs are distributed throughout the cytoplasm, translation rate is increased again. This data agrees with 35S methionine labeling data [9], and demonstrates the strong correlation between the assembly/disassembly of SGs with the shut-off of host cell translation, thus illustrating the power of this technique for the study of localized translation (or its absence) in virus-infected cells.",

To examine the relationship between viral RNA replication complexes and SGs, it is useful to visualize nascent viral RNA in situ and co-stain for SG marker(s). A number of techniques are available for co-staining RNA and protein, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 5-bromourudine 5\u2032-triphosphate (BrUTP) labeling. An antibody specific for dsRNA (SCICONS English & Scientific Consulting, J2-1406) can also be used to label sites of viral RNA synthesis in cells infected with many types of virus [42]. Similar to puromycin labeling, BrUTP labeling involves incubating cells with modified ribonucleotide BrUTP to allow its incorporation into nascent RNA, followed by the immunodetection of BrUTP using a specific antibody (Enzo) [43]. BrUTP uptake into cells is facilitated by transfection. This technique allows the detection of viral RNAs, which may be localized to SGs during infection. Its major advantage over in conventional in situ hybridization and dsRNA staining, if used together with actinomycin D (Act D; see below) to block host cellular transcription, it is selective for newly synthesized viral RNA produced during short times during infection. In our previous work [9], we used in vivo BrUTP labeling to identify nascent SFV RNA in combination with TIA-1 immunostaining to identify SGs. We found that, when present in virus-infected cells, the SGs were typically located in regions of the cell devoid of newly produced viral RNA. As the infection progressed, and viral replication complexes were distributed throughout the cytoplasm, SGs were no longer detectable. We did not detect BrUTP labeled viral RNA in SGs, in agreement with FISH results that did not detect viral RNA in SGs.",

However, for other RNA viruses, BrUTP staining may label both viral and cellular RNA, confounding interpretation of staining. Since viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are not sensitive to actinomycin D (Act D), this inhibitor can be used during BrUTP labeling to ensure that only viral RNAs incorporate the BrUTP. Act D inhibits DNA-dependent transcription by binding DNA template and preventing mRNA elongation by RNA polymerases, but does not bind RNA. Fig. 2\nA shows MEFs after staining with BrUTP for 1 h in the presence or absence of Act D. In non Act D-treated cells, BrUTP staining is brightest in the nucleoli, the sites of ribosomal RNA synthesis.

Isoxazole is a small molecule known to induce the differentiation of stem cells [46], and a biotinylated version (B-isox) was recently shown to precipitate a subset of RNA-binding proteins and RNAs in a temperature-dependent manner from cell lysates [47], [48]. These precipitated proteins were highly enriched in SG-associated proteins and protein components of other types of RNA granules [48]. Most B-isox precipitating proteins contain low-complexity (LC), unstructured regions of unknown function, and these LC regions are necessary and sufficient for their precipitation by B-isox. These studies led the McKnight laboratory [48] to propose that RNA granule assembly is mediated by a concentration and temperature dependent liquid/liquid phase transition. Although the mechanism of B-isox precipitation is not well understood, using B-isox precipitation to selectively precipitate SG-competent proteins can serve as a surrogate method for crude purification of SG components, essentially mimicking stress in vitro. The assay involves the simple addition of the B-isox to cell lysates, incubation with agitation at 4 \u00b0C, followed by centrifugation to separate the precipitate and supernatant fractions and analysis by SDS\u2013PAGE.",

            "text": "We used this technique to determine the B-isox solubility of G3BP1 and its binding partners in cells expressing EGFP-fusion proteins carrying the G3BP-binding motifs from SFV nsP3, described in [15]. U2OS cell lines stably expressing low and high levels of EGFP-31-wt (clones 1 and 8, respectively) or a non-G3BP-binding version (EGFP-31-F3A) were lysed and subjected to B-isox precipitation in the presence or absence of RNase and analyzed using SDS\u2013PAGE. Gels containing lysates, supernatants and B-isox precipitates were silver stained to confirm equal protein loading and to demonstrate that precipitation only occurred in the presence of B-isox (Fig. 3\nA and B). Replicate samples were resolved on SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting (Fig. 3C). The general profile of proteins precipitating with B-isox was similar to expected [48], and did not change appreciably with expression of either EGFP-31-wt or -F3A. RNase pretreatment of the lysates removed the high molecular mass bands (identified as RNA by their failure to stain with protein stains, data not shown), and resulted in the precipitation of a number of smaller bands identified as ribosomal proteins (data not shown). When pelleted material was analyzed by immunoblotting for SG proteins, we observed that CAPRIN-1, eIF3b and TIAR all precipitated equally well from cells expressing low or high levels of EGFP-31-wt or EGFP-31-F3A (Fig. 3C). However, G3BP-1 and -2 precipitation was inhibited in cells expressing high levels of EGFP-31-wt (clone 8), indicating that the EGFP-31-wt/G3BP interaction alters it such that it is no longer \u201cSG competent\u201d by this criterion. This result is in agreement with our previous work showing that overexpression of EGFP-31-wt but not EGFP-31-F3A blocks the formation of SA-induced SGs [14]. Further description of the use of B-isox to determine solubility of SG proteins will be published elsewhere.",

            "text": "The number of reports implicating SGs in various diverse viral life cycles is increasing [49] and now includes members of most families of RNA viruses and several DNA viruses. Mutant viruses, which fail to inhibit the SG response are attenuated in vitro [8], [14], [15], [50], and it is therefore becoming more obvious that SGs represent a very early, cell-intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism. It is therefore not surprising that so many viruses encode proteins or RNAs that inhibit the formation of SGs on viral mRNAs. The condensation of mRNPs into SGs creates defined subcellular regions that recruit/divert a host of signaling molecules, suggesting that SGs constitute RNA-dependent signaling hubs that communicate a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d [7] to the rest of the cell, and link SG formation to apoptosis. These signaling functions of SGs will likely prove critical to their anti-viral activity. However, despite recent progress, much remains to be learned about SG functions in viral replication. The techniques described here will facilitate further investigations into mechanisms of SG-mediated viral restriction and viral evasion strategies.",
