In recent years, the tourism industry has suffered continual attacks of tremendous crisis events (Faulkner, 2001), both human-induced (i.e., the \u201c9/11\u201d terrorist attack in 2001 or the global financial crisis in 2008) and by natural causes (i.e., the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and the earthquake in Japan in 2011), leading to significant repercussions on tourism destinations (Breitsohl & Garrod, 2016). Therefore, crisis management is of great importance to tourism destinations (Ritchie, 2004). In the era of Web 2.0, the development of Internet and social media has greatly changed the traditional top-down spread of access to information in crisis events, which in turn has challenged and impacted applications of crisis management (Lin, Spence, Sellnow, & Lachlan, 2016).",

            "text": "It is acknowledged that social media plays an important role when crisis events break out (Schroeder, Pennington-Gray, Donohoe, & Kiousis, 2013). The multi-way communication channels and high interaction features inherent to social media (Kietzmann et al., 2011, Lotan et al., 2011) enable it not only to be an important information source and method of dissemination (Starbird et al., 2015), but also to provide an open and free space for the public (Dong, Liang, & He, 2016), which therefore greatly encourages public online participation in the crisis event, prompting the public opinion field to expand from offline and face-to-face to cyberspace (Xie, Qiao, Shao, & Chen, 2016). According to a telephone survey conducted by Xie et al. (2016) in China, 64.7% of interviewees participate in discussion and communication in a crisis event, and more than 40% are involved in communication on social media. At such times, social media users are no longer passive information receivers, but instead active participants in crisis communications (Cheng, Mitomo, Otsuka, & Jeon, 2016); this kind of online participation behavior greatly promotes the secondary crisis communication of crisis events on social media, which is defined as social media users' online behavior of commenting on, sharing, or forwarding posts about crises (Schultz et al., 2011, Utz et al., 2013). Further, the secondary crisis communication will cause other, new problems (Hu, 2008) and have a social impact (Zhou, 2009), including on social media users\u2019 behavioral intentions such as the willingness to boycott the organization and negative word-of-mouth communication (Coombs and Holladay, 2009, Coombs and Holladay, 2007, Coombs and Holladay, 2008). Therefore, with the involvement of the Internet and social media, secondary crisis communication has become a new feature of crisis communication (Lin et al., 2016, Schultz et al., 2011, Utz et al., 2013), the influence of which should not be ignored.",

            "text": "This study takes the \u201cOccupy Central\u201d event in Hong Kong as a case study. Occupy Central was a political protest campaign calling for the general election of Hong Kong's chief executive. Occupy Central was officially launched on Sept. 28, 2014 (while began on March 27, 2013), and ended on Dec. 15, 2014, lasting 79 days in total (Jiang, 2015). Because of the event's political sensitivity, the information spreading in mainland China was under strict control, and reports from mainstream and mass media were of obvious political orientation (Chen, 2015). However, it is worth noting that social media have come to constitute a significant tool for promoting the communication of Occupy Central (Min & Liu, 2015). Based on statistics collected by the author, with the spread of Occupy Central on the Chinese social media Weibo, more and more people in mainland China began to get involved. Weibo (weibo.com) is a micro-blog platform created in August 2009 by Sina.com, and is the biggest online news portal website and one of the most popular social media in mainland China (Shao, Li, Morrison, & Wu, 2016). Similar to Twitter, a Weibo user can post texts, photos, or videos to all his/her followers or selected friends, and meanwhile get messages updated by other users they follow or that are automatically recommended by Weibo, for which they can comment, forward, or \u201clike\u201d the posts they are interested in. With all these features incorporated, Weibo has become an important field of public opinion in mainland China (Ji, 2016). This study focuses precisely on the secondary crisis communication of Occupy Central on Weibo, that is, of Weibo users' sending comments, forwarding, and sharing with regard to this political event. As collected by the author, there were only 232 posts by official Weibo accounts (those certified with a capital \u201cV\u201d on Weibo, such as \u201cPeople.com V\u201d) on Occupy Central; however, the number of total forwarded posts and comments by Weibo users grew to 46,037 and 22,399, respectively. Although public opinion on Weibo is in some degree under control, there is no denying that Weibo users played a very important and active role in spreading messages about Occupy Central. Within the secondary crisis communication, especially, of Occupy Central on Weibo, more and more negative emotions toward Hong Kong were displayed, along with the intentional behavior of a tourism boycott. These showed a strong reluctance to travel to Hong Kong, as for example, one suggesting \u201cOnly those who have nothing to do will go to Hong Kong\u201d [JWHSZGD 2014-11-02 09:34]. This phenomenon of secondary crisis communication regarding Occupy Central on Weibo\u2014the shift from a political event to a tourism boycott\u2014aroused the author's attention.",

            "text": "Because tourism is extremely sensitive to and easily influenced by external environmental factors such as politics, the economy, and nature, research on crisis events has received great attention in tourism (Ara\u00f1a and Le\u00f3n, 2008, Blake and Sinclair, 2003, Paraskevas et al., 2013; S\u00f6nmez, Apostolopoulos, & Tarlow, 1999). More importantly, the development of the Internet and social media has greatly changed the spreading pattern of crisis events and the public's participation in them, thus giving rise to new challenges for crisis management in tourism destinations. The containment of the crisis and communication are the key points of crisis management (Coombs, 1999). Media play a significant role in crisis communication (Cheng et al., 2016), with tremendous influential power (Ball-Rokeach, 1985) to not only influence the crisis event itself, but also to have a counter effect on people's understanding and construction of society (Jackson, Nielsen, & Hsu, 2011). Compared to traditional mass media, the significant influencing power of social media in a crisis event has been recognized and a subject of wide concern (Cheng et al., 2016). During a crisis event, social media will potentially impact individuals' thoughts, behaviors, and reactions (Schroeder & Pennington-Gray, 2015). Ha and Fang (2012) think that the Internet can competitively replace the mass media, and Olorunnisola and Martin (2013) also agree that social media will greatly challenge the role and function of traditional mass media. Realizing the importance of social media, the government has also begun to use it in crisis information communications (Park, Choi, Kim, & Rho, 2015). Thus, the role of social media in a crisis event should not be ignored (Cheng et al., 2016). Currently, the research on crisis events and social media mainly focuses on demographic characteristics of social media users (Sutton, Palen, & Shklovski, 2008), how crisis information spreads (Paraskevas et al., 2013), and crisis management (Schroeder et al., 2013). Specifically for crisis management, the management after the crisis is of the most concern, such as the image repairing of tourism destinations on social media (e.g. Avraham, 2015).",

The development of the Internet and social media, however, has provided the public with an equal and interactive communication platform, whereby social media users can express their own opinions online (Sandoval & Fuchs, 2010) as well as by sending comments, sharing, and discussing the crisis event with other followers (Lin et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Simultaneously, the development of social media also greatly promotes the public participation (Shah, 2005) in crisis events, influencing the discourse power between media and the public (Castells, 2007). Over a long period of time, public opinion is guided and strictly controlled by official media, and the news reported by such media is highly homogeneous (Sparks, 2008). However, the development of the Internet and social media sharply impact and challenge the traditional media surveillance, and social media has gradually become one of the most important realms of public opinion and the main channel for public opinion to be expressed (Xie et al., 2016), for it provides both an opportunity and a mechanism for the public to participate in crisis communication and discussion (Lin et al., 2016). Thus, the theories of framing and agenda-setting and the conceptualization of gatekeeping may not be applicable in a social media environment (Spence, Lachlan, Spates, & Lin, 2013). The idea that media set the agenda of what is on the public's mind is a concept called agenda-setting (Carroll and McCombs, 2003, McCombs and Shaw, 1972), which functions as an extension of the role media plays as gatekeepers of information influencing the public's exposure and attitudes towards issues (Thompson, 2008). Priming is a concept closely related to the theory of agenda-setting, in that media guide the public to make evaluations regarding a particular topic (Holbrook & Hill, 2005). However, the public now has a stronger voice in crisis communication and developing the conversation, shifting from passive consumption of information to an active participation in the news process (Lin et al., 2016). The public participation on social media during a crisis event involving sharing and discussing is called secondary crisis communication, which has been greatly ignored in recent research (Utz et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Secondary crisis communication on social media refers to social media users' online behavior of commenting on, sharing, or forwarding posts about crises (Schultz et al., 2011, Utz et al., 2013). On the Internet and social media, the public holds an active attitude in getting involved in social event discussions (Xie et al., 2016). Social media provides an opportunity for users to express their own opinions (Coleman, 2005), while also serving as a relatively safe avenue to discuss political circumstances in China (Xie et al., 2016). The online discussions of social media users promote a new way for political participation\u2014mainly through online debates and dialogue (Yang, 2003). During a crisis event, the online participation behavior of the public (Xie et al., 2016) greatly promotes secondary crisis communication on social media (Utz et al., 2013). However, in China, although the Internet is endowed with the value of spreading and expressing information, netizens there lack the tradition and understanding of political and democratic expression (Yang, 2003). As a result, although social media encourages the online participation of the public (Coleman, 2005, Wei, 2013, Zhou, 2009), including public debates and expression (Yang, 2003), activist behavior is more easily incurred on social media (Xie et al., 2016). Therefore, the active online participation of social media users greatly promotes secondary crisis communication on social media, while leading to other new problems (Hu, 2008) and social influence (Zhou, 2009) in the process. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the secondary crisis communication on social media, in which the emotions of social media users have a vital impact on the public's online participation behavior (Coombs & Holladay, 2005).",

            "text": "During secondary crisis communication, the public's emotions are impacted by the type of crisis event (Utz et al., 2013). Vasquez (1993) puts forward that individuals will transform their opinions regarding an event into a kind of symbolized reality, following the process of information receiving, constructing, and reconstructing, which is a symbolic undertaking for individuals to understand their world. Based on Vasquez's opinion, Lee (2004) thinks that when a crisis event happens, the public will actively construct a symbolic reality around that crisis event and related organizations and participants, which will change with the development of the crisis. To be more specific, the public will be actively involved in the process of attribution and evaluation toward the crisis event and relative problems. In addition, Weiner (1985) puts forward the attributional theory, with the thinking that when a negative, accidental, or important event happens, people will begin an attributional process; when people attribute the responsibility of the crisis to internal causes, they will become angry, and, conversely, when external causes are attributed, an emotion of sympathy will arise. Furthermore, as compared to a crisis caused externally and unavoidably, when an intentionally man-made crisis happens, social media users will react more negatively (Utz et al., 2013). Breitsohl and Garrod (2016) innovatively analyzed tourists' reaction to a series of unethical crisis events (internally imposed crises) taking place in a tourism destination based on the cognitive appraisal theory. They found that the more severe the incident, and the greater the attribution of responsibility to organizations within the destination, the more hostile the emotion the tourists held toward the destination, and, therefore, the more negative word-of-mouth spread and the lower the loyalty experienced for the destination. Thus, the negative impacts of internally-imposed and man-made crisis events are larger than for those externally caused (Breitsohl & Garrod, 2016).",

As mentioned above, Chinese netizens lack the tradition and understanding of political and democratic expression (Yang, 2003), which can mean individuals' emotions like anger (Yang, 2003) are easily agitated and intensified in the process of online discussion and debates on social media\u2014called \u201cThe Rising Cacophony\u201d on the Internet by Hu (2008) in a book of the same name. Furthermore, based on the cognitive appraisal theory (Lazarus, 1982, Lazarus, 1991a, Lazarus, 1991b), individuals' reactions toward an event follow the process of cognition-emotion-behavior (Breitsohl & Garrod, 2016), which means that the appraisal of an event will arouse certain emotional reactions (Choi, Sung, Lee, & Cho, 2011), and then influence individuals\u2019 behavioral intentions (Frijda, Kuipers, & ter Schure, 1989). Emotion is a psychological status of a different degree of feelings, where there is a specific object of the emotion, which then results in a certain behavioral reaction (Cohen & Areni, 1991). Therefore, the emotions of the public aroused during online participation on social media will further influence their behaviors; to be sure, the behaviors here refer to the online behaviors of the public on social media. Yang (2003) quotes a comment from a netizen called Xiaohao, who said that emotions like anger finally result in the behavior deviating from the democratic spirits in such a free and equal cyberspace, just like personal attacks:",

An early example is the tourism boycott of Guatemala organized by the International Union of Food and Allied Workers in 1979 to pressure the military government to refrain from violations of human rights (Casta\u00f1eda & Burtner, 2010). Another case was the tourism boycott of Myanmar by a number of organizations to prevent the military junta there from obtaining the hard currency and global legitimacy needed to survive (Hudson, 2007). In conclusion, the phenomenon and the impact of the tourism boycott has aroused researchers\u2019 attentions (e.g., Casta\u00f1eda and Burtner, 2010, Herrera and Hoagland, 2006, Parsons and Draheim, 2009, Parsons and Rawles, 2003), but how a tourism boycott would occur specifically in a social media environment needs to be further researched.",

Colonized by both Britain and Japan for a total of 155 years, Hong Kong finally returned to China in 1997 as the first Special Administrative Region of China (Liu, 2016) under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy (Xie, 2012). In the beginning, travel to Hong Kong was not extensively open to mainland Chinese because of the Chinese government's control (Zhang, Chong, & Ap, 1999). A tremendous change took place in 2003 when the central government released the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) policy (Liu, 2016), allowing travelers from mainland China to visit Hong Kong and Macau on an individual basis (Rong & Zheng, 2008). The purpose of the IVS was to boost the economies of Hong Kong and Macau, which suffered badly from the Financial Crisis in Southeast Asia in 1997 and from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Wang & Sun, 2010). The IVS successfully pushed mainland Chinese tourists' arrivals to Hong Kong to an unprecedentedly high level (Liu, 2016) and directly promoted the development of the tourism industry in Hong Kong (Cui, 2016). However, despite the positive economic benefits, the surge of mainland Chinese tourists to Hong Kong meanwhile also caused strong social conflicts, resulting in a series of problems such as a milk powder shortage, a large influx of pregnant mainland Chinese women and subsequent anchor babies, increased prices, and traffic tensions (Sun, Li, & Zhou, 2016). In particular, anti-parallel-trader and anti-individual-visit activities launched in Hong Kong intensified the bilateral conflicts (Liu, 2016). Under these circumstances, the number of mainland Chinese tourists arriving in Hong Kong dropped hugely in 2015 (Yang, 2016).",

On March 27, 2013, Benny Tai (associate professor of law at the university of Hong Kong), Chan Kin-man (associate professor of sociology at the Chinese university of Hong Kong) and the Reverend Chu Yiu-ming formed an organization called \u201cOccupy Central with Love and Peace,\u201d saying that the goal of Occupy Central was to achieve universal suffrage in the Hong Kong Chief Executive election in 2017, and marking the beginning of this movement. On July 2, 2014, an Occupy Central rehearsal was held, resulting in 511 arrests. On August 17, 2014, a march asking for universal suffrage without Occupy Central was held with nearly 190,000 people involved. On August 31, 2014, China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (also referred to as NPCSC), announced its decision for Hong Kong's electoral systems in 2017, regulating that the Chief Executive in Hong Kong can be generally elected in 2017, while the candidates should be nominated by the committee. On September 14, 2014, a march was launched by the Occupy Central movement with nearly 4000 people participating to express dissatisfaction with the decision made by NPCSC and support for an upcoming 9/22 students' strike. From September 22 to 26, 2014, the students' strike was held in Hong Kong, with nearly 13,000 teachers, students, and citizens involved. Finally, on September 28, 2014, Occupy Central was officially launched. (see Fig. 1\n)",

Similar to earlier crisis events, the outbreak of Occupy Central decreased the number of tourists coming from mainland China to Hong Kong in a very short amount of time. However, the difference is that this time, to this day, the tourism industry in Hong Kong is still in a severe situation and has not recovered to pre-Occupy levels. Throughout the recent development of the tourism industry in Hong Kong, it has always been the number one outbound tourism destination for mainland citizens (from 2003 to 2013), when it became well-known as the \u201cPearl of the Orient\u201d and a paradise for shopping and gourmet food. But according to a report by Travel Daily, Japan and South Korea leapt to the top two outbound tourism destinations respectively for tourists from mainland China, with those willing to travel to Hong Kong rapidly falling from its formerly top position. There is no doubt that the tourism industry in Hong Kong suffered greatly during the Occupy Central crisis event; however, nowadays, although the crisis has calmed, the tourism industry in Hong Kong is still depressed.(see Fig. 2\n)",

The ROST Emotion Analysis Tool applies the dictionary-based approach to extract sentiment values from Chinese-text materials (Ren, Wu, Su, Qin, & Shen, 2010). The self-developed dictionaries include two files: one is a list of positive words and the other negative words, where all the words have been given corresponding emotional values based on psychological definitions (Ding, Xu, & Tan, 2016). The mechanism of the ROST Emotion Analysis Tool is as follows. First, it identifies keywords in each sentence, including emotion-related phases, emotional words, negative words, and adverbs of degree (Ren et al., 2010). Second, it assigns emotional values to each keyword based on the self-developed dictionaries. Finally, by imposing a proper weight to the words, it calculates the emotional value of each sentence, including emotional tendency and intensity.",

In order to analyze the spreading and transferring process, the whole diffusion process was first divided into four stages based on key events and the crisis lifecycle model by Fink (1986), those being: the prodromal, acute crisis, chronic crisis, and resolution stages (see Fig. 3\n). As Fink's theory shows, a crisis event is not just an isolated and accidental event, but the inevitable result of a series of events, so crisis management is also a dynamic chain linking to all four of the stages mentioned above (Cai, 2007). Because Fink's view of crisis events significantly matches the features of the diffusion process of the secondary crisis communication of Occupy Central on Weibo, in that this crisis was dynamic and promoted by a series of crises, Fink's model was adopted for this study. Specifically, the prodromal phase becomes apparent with the initiation of certain steps; next, the acute crisis is when the actual crisis is unfolding; the chronic crisis actually refers to the lasting effects of the crisis; and there is a clear end to the crisis event in the resolution phase (Stewart & Gail Wilson, 2016).",

Occupy Central was launched to fight for universal suffrage in the Hong Kong Chief Executive election in 2017, so when focusing more on this event, Weibo users tended to discuss more about the election issues.

In the secondary crisis communication of Occupy Central on Weibo, the topics shifted dynamically over time, from the Occupy Central event and political discussions in the prodromal phase, to regional debates in the acute crisis phase, to group confrontations in the chronic crisis phase, to, finally, a developed tourism boycott in the resolution phase. The topic's transfer to group confrontation reflects the activist behavior of social media (Xie et al., 2016). New problems (Hu, 2008) and social impacts will arise as the topics of secondary crisis communication transfer. In this study, the group confrontation in the secondary crisis communication represented exactly the new problem on social media derived from the Occupy Central event, especially the confrontation between people from mainland China and Hong Kong\u2014a new crisis caused on social media, leading finally to mainland Chinese's behavioral intention to boycott travel to Hong Kong. Therefore, the secondary crisis communication on social media not only promotes the spreading of crisis events, but also possibly leads to another new crisis as topics shift sequentially and dynamically.",

The emotions of the public are essentially related to their online participation behaviors (Coombs & Holladay, 2005) and affected by the type of event (Utz et al., 2013), as testified to in the secondary crisis communication of Occupy Central, where positive emotion is positively significantly related to political issues, while being negatively significantly related to tourism. Weibo users' emotions turning from positive to increasingly negative in secondary crisis communication indicates just such emotional change during the public's online participation. In the Occupy Central event and political discussions in the prodromal phase, the emotion in the secondary crisis communication is mostly positive, expressing a strong patriotic feeling; however, in the phases of acute and chronic crisis, the emotion turns increasingly negative in debates, and confrontation between Hong Kong and mainland China, especially between people from the two sides whose personal and nationalistic emotions are elicited, directly present the outbreak of anger. This kind of emotion can be aroused when an offense affects oneself, one's social relations, or even the public at large (Breitsohl and Garrod, 2016, Lazarus, 1991a, Lazarus, 1991b). The negative emotions on social media tend to develop into personal attacks and cyber violence as shown in the latter phase of the secondary crisis communication of Occupy Central on Weibo. Moreover, the anger and hostility Weibo users show toward Hong Kong people during the secondary crisis communication is the antecedent of their behavioral intention to boycott travel to Hong Kong, reflecting Weibo users' feelings of disappointment and being hurt. In conclusion, during secondary crisis communication, the public's emotions can be easily elicited and can spread out quickly, the potential influence of which could be worse and more lasting than the crisis event itself.",

However, in the regional debates in the acute crisis phase, the focus of the public tends to transfer more to issues between mainland China and Hong Kong, with emotions becoming increasingly negative. Then, regional debates between mainland China and Hong Kong intensified to group confrontations in the chronic crisis phase, where the focus of mainland Chinese on Weibo transferred to the \u201cperson\u201d from Hong Kong. The confrontation between people from mainland China and Hong Kong is actually the performance of cyber nationalism triggered by the Occupy Central event, a social phenomenon (Liu, 2016) of netizens expressing and spreading nationalistic comments and emotions (Wang, 2006, Wu, 2007) and a reflection of the complicated relationship and complexity between Hong Kong and mainland China. The group confrontation on Weibo this time elicited the nationalistic and emotional conflicts between the two sides again, leading to Weibo users\u2019 increasing emotions of anger and hostility. The negative emotions finally result in their boycotting travel to Hong Kong, which shows the potential risk and impact of secondary crisis communication on tourism destinations.",

The secondary crisis communication of Occupy Central on Weibo has intensified the emotional conflict between mainland China and Hong Kong, and even now, the behavioral intention of mainland Chinese tourists to boycott tourism still remains strong. On April 10, 2016, an official Weibo account called \u201cVista\u770b\u5929\u4e0b\u201d posted a piece of news on Weibo with the title \u201cThe Hong Kong government appropriated 240 million Hong Kong dollars to reshape the tourism image: especially promoting to mainland China.\u201d (see Fig. 6\n). This post attracted wide attention from Weibo users, earning 215 forwarding and 698 comments by Nov. 26, 2016; the Weibo users showed strong feelings of antipathy toward the Hong Kong government's behavior of emphasizing tourism promotion in mainland China, and meanwhile continued to express the opinion of boycotting travel to Hong Kong through strong confrontational emotion toward Hong Kong people. For example, \u201cI will never go to Hong Kong any more, how arrogant Hong Kong people are\u201d [MAO-MAOmAo 2016-4-11 09:35], and \u201cSo what. The government leaves alone the people insulting mainland China. Now want to depend on mainland China again for the loss? It's silly\u201d [SKZY 2016-4-11 14:05]. It is undeniable that the emotional confrontation between mainland Chinese tourists and Hong Kong people was not entirely caused by the Occupy Central event, much of it is concerned with a complicated history and relationship between mainland China and Hong Kong, as well as the identity crisis of post-colonial Hong Kong (Zhang, L Espoir Decosta, & McKercher, 2015). However, through the reaction of Weibo users, the intangible but long-lasting impact of mainland Chinese's negative emotions toward the tourism industry in Hong Kong can be seen clearly.",
