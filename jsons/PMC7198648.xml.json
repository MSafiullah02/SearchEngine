The combination of both methods made it possible, for the first time, to detect viral genomes directly within the affected myocardial tissue in patients with suspected myocarditis. A wide range of different PCR assays have been developed, which are suitable for identifying different cardiac RNA and/or DNA viruses with a higher sensitivity than standard immunohistochemical methods used for the detection of viral proteins [3, 6\u20139].",

Comparable prevalence rates have been confirmed by others [33], who also reported that persistence of parvovirus B19 in patients with left ventricular dysfunction was found to be associated with a progressive impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction, whereas spontaneous viral elimination was associated with a significant improvement in left ventricular function [33]. However, in contrast to enteroviruses, spontaneous virus elimination of parvovirus B19 was observed in only a proportion of patients. These results suggest that persisting cardiac viral infections may constitute a major cause of progressive left ventricular dysfunction in patients with past myocarditis or DCM. In 24 patients who presented with acute-onset angina pectoris and ST-segment elevations or T\u2011wave inversion mimicking acute myocardial infarction but with normal coronary angiogram, the histological analysis excluded mostly active or borderline myocarditis. But instead B19V, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses genomes were detected in the myocardium of 12, three, and two patients, respectively [34]. In the autopsy study of a female patient with clinical signs of myocardial infarction and histopathological fulminant myocarditis, the presence of B19V genomes was exclusively located in endothelial cells of the smaller intramyocardial vessels. Immunohistochemical staining exhibited marked expression of E\u2011selectin by endothelial cells, a finding indicative of endothelial dysfunction [35]. These findings may explain the fact that many patients with B19V-associated myocarditis present with the clinical signs of microangiopathy that are also typical of ischemic heart disease.",

            "text": "Symptoms of parvovirus B19-positive myocarditis and vasculitis can mimic coronary artery disease. But the primary cause of angina is small vessel disease. The VP1u receptor of parvovirus B19 is located on erythroid progenitor cells such as permissive endothelial cells [70]. Anthony et al. [71] have shown that the anti-inflammatory activity of monomeric IgG is dependent on the sialylation of the N-linked glycan of the IgG Fc fragment. This explains a part of the anti-inflammatory action of IVIg. The IgM fraction of intravenous immunoglobulins with IgG, IgA, and IgM fractions (IVIgGAM) can play an additional role in controlling inflammatory and also autoimmune disease [2, 68]. Intravenous immunoglobulins interact widely with the host immune system. The wide spectrum of activities unfolded by IVIg can be appreciated in Fig. 4.",

A substantial number of randomized and controlled or registry studies have examined the effect of immunosuppression in patients with DCM or suspected myocarditis [73\u201378]. In the randomized Myocarditis Trial of 1995 by Mason et al. [74], the overall result was \u201cno benefit, no harm.\u201d But in this trial the biopsies were not examined to exclude viral infection of the myocardium [75]. To date, immunosuppression is contraindicated in viral myocarditis according to current guidelines. In the TIMIC study, virus was excluded by PCR. Only severely compromised myocarditis patients without demonstrable viral persistence in the biopsy could be included in this double-blind randomized trial [73]. The ejection fraction in the treatment arm comprising 43 patients increased from 26.5% at baseline to 45.6% after 6 months (p < 0.001). Accordingly, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and New York Heart Association class decreased significantly [73].",
