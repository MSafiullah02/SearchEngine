In the century following its first description, leukaemia remained a near uniformly fatal disease. In 1948, astute observations among children with leukaemia, made by Sidney Farber2, led to therapeutic breakthroughs \u2014 ushering in an era of hope. Since then, paediatric oncology cooperative group trials and pioneering work by E. Donnall Thomas on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) among patients with leukaemia have led to dramatic improvements in the cure rates of childhood ALL3,4. Despite improvements in overall remission rates (ORRs) for children with ALL, until now, the cure rates for children with relapsed and/or refractory disease remain disappointingly low5,6. In the 1970s, E. Donnall Thomas considered a 15% salvage rate after disease relapse to be a promising result among a patient population with previously even more dismal outcomes7. Since that time, durable remission rates have increased, with other dramatic improvements in supportive care, such as antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy, infection control, HLA tissue typing, immunosuppression, transfusion support, and paediatric critical care management, resulting in improved patient survival.",

Notably, this novel genetically engineered, CD19-targeted, autologous T cell immunotherapy was approved specifically for a paediatric and young adult indication. While CAR T cell immunotherapy is an exciting paradigm shift in anticancer therapy, this treatment modality is associated with unique toxicities, which can lead to very rapid and life-threatening cardiorespiratory and/or neurological deterioration. Thus, this novel therapy requires the medical vigilance of a diverse multidisciplinary team \u2014 and the associated comprehensive clinical infrastructure \u2014 to ensure optimal outcomes.",

Specifically, the modified CAR T cells express an engineered chimeric cell-surface receptor comprising an extracellular antigen-recognition domain, which is usually an antibody single-chain variable fragment (scFv), linked to at least one intracellular signalling domain \u2014 usually the CD3\u03b6 chain of the T cell receptor plus one or more domains derived from co-stimulatory receptors (such as CD28 or 4-1BB ligand receptor (4-1BB; also known as TNFRSF9)). The extracellular portion of the CAR enables recognition of a specific antigen (such as CD19), and the signalling domains stimulate T cell proliferation, cytolysis, and cytokine secretion to enable elimination of the target cell12,13. Autologous or allogeneic cells genetically engineered to express CARs targeting certain molecules commonly presented on the surface of cancer cells have been associated with durable remissions among patients for whom no alternative therapies were effective14\u201327.",

Results from animal studies reported in May 2018 implicate recipient monocyte-derived and/or macrophage-derived IL-1, IL-6, and nitric oxide (and not CAR T cell-derived cytokines) as the key determinants of the severity of CRS and CRES34,35. Indeed, CRS is a systemic inflammatory response caused by the CAR T cells and involving other immune cells that is typically characterized by fever, hypoxia, tachycardia, hypotension, and multi-organ dysfunction36. CRES can occur concurrently with CRS, following its resolution, or without associated CRS and is characterized by encephalopathy, delirium, seizures, and, rarely, cerebral oedema37. Almost half of all patients who receive tisagenlecleucel require intensive monitoring and critical care support, predominantly owing to these toxicities9,38. CRS and CRES are generally reversible but can be fatal. Paediatric-specific management guidelines, comprehensive training of interdisciplinary staff, effective communication, and an appropriately phased infrastructure to ensure that adequate resources are available should facilitate the early diagnosis and appropriate management of paediatric patients who develop CRS and/or CRES after receiving CAR T cell therapy as a standard of care or according to a research protocol \u2014 and thereby achieve optimal outcomes. Herein, we provide consensus guidelines for the use of CAR T cells in paediatric patients with cancer.",

The PALISI Network includes clinical researchers from >90 paediatric intensive-care units across North America and beyond. The PALISI HSCT Subgroup is dedicated to improving the health and survival of children who require critical care during and following HSCT and cellular therapy through collaborative clinical and translational research. The guideline panel comprised a multidisciplinary and inter-professional team, including physicians with expertise in HSCT for paediatric and adult patients, translational immunotherapy researchers, paediatric intensivists, neurologists, paediatric nurses, advanced-practice providers, pharmacists, clinical nurse specialists and nursing administrators, and health-care administrators from a diverse group of medical centres. Using a modified Delphi method, the panel aimed to provide comprehensive guidelines for the safe administration of various CAR T cell therapies (standard of care and/or research protocol administration), the early recognition of CRS and/or CRES, and the management of these toxicities39. Levels of evidence and strength of recommendations were based on the classification schemes described by Shekelle and colleagues40 (Supplementary Table 1).

Patients should undergo pre-collection testing to ensure that they are medically eligible to proceed with leukapheresis. Institutional or protocol-specific guidelines should outline haematological and other clinical criteria to proceed with collection.

Allogeneic CAR cells would presumably offer an \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019, third-party approach to CAR-based cell therapy56\u201359. CAR-transduced cord blood-derived NK cells have been reported to have potent anticancer effects in preclinical studies60. This allogeneic NK cell approach to CAR cell therapy might also be associated with a reduced risk of GVHD compared with the use of allogeneic T cells. Moreover, the NK cell product used included a \u2018suicide\u2019 gene \u2014 inducible caspase 9 \u2014 that could be pharmacologically activated to eliminate the transduced cells, thus providing an additional safety mechanism60. A clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of this product is currently underway at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (NCT03056339). In other allogeneic CAR-expressing cell-therapy approaches, functional co-expression of RQR8, a construct combining epitopes from CD34 and CD20, renders the CAR cells sensitive to the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, as a safety feature56,61. Safety mechanisms designed to eliminate transduced cells have also been added to autologous CAR-expressing cells, such as anti-CD19 CAR T cells also expressing inactive, truncated EGFR, which enables the cells to be targeted through administration of the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab49. The recommendations provided herein should be applicable to both autologous and allogeneic CAR-based cell therapies.",

Both the efficacy and toxicity profiles of CAR T cell therapy might vary depending on the specific product administered and individual patient characteristics. Thus, the decision on inpatient versus outpatient management of patients treated with CAR T cell therapy should involve consideration of the toxicity profile of the product used, the clinical status of the patient (including risk of TLS), and the ability of the institution to deliver prompt and comprehensive outpatient management, as well as the ability of the patient to access such care. Given the potential for rapid clinical deterioration, if CAR T cell therapy is administered in an outpatient setting, a low threshold should be used for patient admission upon development of fever and/or other signs or symptoms that are suggestive of CRS and/or CRES38 (Table 1). The presence of a reliable, consistent, and well-informed caregiver is essential to facilitate outpatient administration of CAR T cell therapy. In instances in which patients are not admitted for CAR T cell infusion and CRS\u2013CRES monitoring, adequate outpatient facilities are needed, with extended outpatient hours (as defined by the institutions), prompt access to emergency and critical care, and trained staff who are knowledgeable of CAR T cell toxicity and are capable of prompt patient evaluation and management available at all times. This requires adequate outpatient space with a design appropriate to the protection of patients who are immunocompromised while they are being triaged. Moreover, rapid access to a cellular therapy physician, and pharmacy, laboratory, and transfusion medicine services should be guaranteed.",

For example, during the international phase II ELIANA study of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed and/or refractory B cell ALL38, 76% of patients underwent cell infusions in the inpatient setting. CRS occurred in 77% of patients, with a median time to onset of 3 days (range 1\u201322 days)38. Almost half of all patients required intensive-care support, with a median stay of 7 days (range 1\u201334 days); intensive-care support included the use of high-dose vasopressors, oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation, and/or dialysis38. Neurological events occurred in 40% of patients, with the majority of cases occurring concurrently with, or soon after resolution of, CRS38. Two deaths occurred within 30 days of CAR T cell infusion (one patient died of cerebral haemorrhage and another died of progressive leukaemia)38. On the basis of the published experience with this product, considering inpatient admission for a minimum of 3\u20137 days following infusion is reasonable, especially as this treatment is increasingly being offered as a standard of care8,38 (Table 1). Nevertheless, the length of inpatient hospitalization and/or need for daily outpatient assessments might vary on the basis of the risks of CRS and CRES, the clinical and developmental status of the patient, and the social support systems available to the patient at home. The risk of developing CRS and/or CRES probably depends on the patient, the source of immune effector used to manufacture the CAR T cell therapy, the specific CAR T cell product, and/or the associated lymphodepletion strategy.",

Regular \u2014 daily, if possible \u2014 monitoring for TLS is also important, and TLS prophylaxis is recommended for patients with a high disease burden16,29,37,82,84,96. In addition, infectious disease prophylaxis against viral, bacterial, and/or fungal pathogens should be prescribed as appropriate63,82. Patients should have adequate hydration with monitoring for acute fluid overload (daily weights and fluid intake\u2013output recording). If needed, transfusions (irradiated blood products) should be ordered according to institutional guidelines for paediatric patients (without routine corticosteroid pre-medication). The risk of bleeding can be exacerbated by hypofibrinogenaemia and/or thrombocytopenia, especially in patients receiving anti-coagulation therapy (including through continuous venovenous haemofiltration)38,82,97. Conservative management of bleeding or hypofibrinogenaemia and/or thrombocytopenia, with the use of cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma, as needed, is recommended to avoid lethal haemorrhage82. Administration of growth factors (G-CSF) should be considered for patients with neutropenic fever8,82. Conditional orders for fever and/or neutropenia and suspected sepsis can enable rapid intervention, when needed, by the nursing unit, outpatient triage personnel, and pharmacy. We recommend creation of a flag or banner in the electronic health system to alert care providers of patients who are CAR T cell recipients. Indeed, recipients of CAR T cell products should be made easily identifiable; in particular, the strong contraindication of these patients to steroids must be highly visible to avoid routine or accidental administration of these drugs (for example, during blood product and other pre-medication orders). An \u2018as needed\u2019 order, which requires a real-time electronic approval by an authorized care-provider, is recommended in order to ensure rapid access to the correct dose of anti-IL-6 therapy (for example, with the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab) when required for the treatment of CRS and/or CRES.",

We recommend that CRS grading performed primarily by physicians, advanced-practice providers, and bedside nurses be reviewed by interdisciplinary team members immediately after each assessment and, when possible, should include participation of the patient and/or parent or caregiver at the bedside. Nurses should ideally perform assessments mid-shift and jointly with incoming nurses during handoff at the end of their shifts.

Reduced requirements for chronic anti-hypertensive medications can also indicate relative hypotension. Furthermore, because some symptoms can be caused by other concurrent conditions (for example, sinus tachycardia can have causes that range from crying to sepsis), care providers must use their clinical judgement to determine CRS attribution. Patients who develop fever with a temperature >38 \u00b0C, for example, should be assessed for infection using blood cultures and chest radiography; additional tests, such as viral PCR, respiratory viral screening, urine cultures, and CT of the chest, should be obtained as clinically indicated. Empiric antibiotic treatment should be initiated, and filgrastim should be considered if the patient is neutropenic and septic. Importantly, the patient\u2019s orders should ensure triggering of such an escalation in care for a temperature >38 \u00b0C \u2014 some nursing units might be accustomed to higher temperature thresholds for intervention.

Symptoms such as malaise, lethargy, weakness, oliguria, irritability, and reduced appetite are not always self-reported by younger children. Among infants, assessment of diapers will be critical to assess urine output and detect diarrhoea. We concur with recommendations that any patient requiring a rapid increase in the dose of vasopressors or exhibiting evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion should be treated intensively for grade 3 CRS, even if the vasopressor therapy required is \u2018low dose\u2019 according to the definition of Lee and colleagues29,37. For children with hypotension owing to CRS, an initial normal saline fluid bolus (10\u201320 ml/kg; maximum 1,000 ml) should be administered; if no improvement is observed, anti-IL-6 therapy should be initiated (Table 2). After administration of anti-IL-6 therapy, the decision to repeat additional fluid boluses versus starting vasopressors should involve consideration of the cardiac and fluid status of the child. For example, the administration of additional fluid boluses should be avoided in patients with underlying cardiac dysfunction and/or signs and symptoms of volume overload (such as pulmonary oedema). Additionally, early use of colloid solutions might be indicated because patients with CRS could potentially develop capillary leak and hypoalbuminaemia more rapidly than patients with sepsis, and the administration of additional fluid boluses might compromise pulmonary function by causing pulmonary oedema. Care should be taken not to trigger acute fluid overload, cardiogenic shock, and/or respiratory compromise. Consideration should be given to adrenal insufficiency in decisions of the initial choice of corticosteroid intervention, if needed (Table 2); patients with vasopressor-resistant hypotension attributed to adrenal insufficiency might respond to stress-dose hydrocortisone only and, thus, high doses of other lymphocytotoxic corticosteroids (dexamethasone or methylprednisolone) can be avoided. Transfer to an intensive-care unit should be considered early in this process (Table 1).",

Accordingly, the grading of CRS-related hypoxia should be based on the use of high-flow oxygen and other non-invasive forms of mechanical ventilation, whereby flow rates and FiO2 are indicators of severity. For example, paediatric patients who require supplemental oxygen exceeding an FiO2 requirement of 40% or those who are receiving non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be classified as having grade 3 CRS and be managed accordingly (Table 2).",

However, no adequately powered randomized studies investigating whether the administration of anti-IL-6 therapy and/or corticosteroids reduces the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy have been reported to date. Notably, the use of anti-IL-6 therapy and/or corticosteroids for the management of CRS (usually following CAR T cell expansion) has not negatively affected disease-free survival outcomes in larger cohorts107,108. Indeed, the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab is currently approved by the FDA for management of CRS109; patients weighing <30 kg are treated at a dose of 12 mg/kg, and those weighing \u226530 kg are treated at a dose of 8 mg/kg110 (Tables 1,2). Clinical responses following the administration of tocilizumab are often observed within 4 hours (ref.33). Patients who do not respond to the first dose of tocilizumab might be less likely to respond to subsequent repeat administration of this agent; for these patients, consideration should be given to administration of corticosteroids \u2014 weighing the risks and benefits of steroid use for CRS and the uncertain risk of suppressing CAR T cell expansion \u2014 and/or alternative agents, such as the anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody siltuximab37,38,111. Corticosteroids can also be administered concurrently with repeat doses of tocilizumab (Table 2). When corticosteroids are used, the taper should be rapid and individualized according to the patient\u2019s response. The initial choice of corticosteroid (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, or methylprednisolone) will vary depending on institutional preference, protocol-specific guidelines, or product label specifications.",

Secondary HLH is thought to occur in the context of an underlying immunological condition and, in the setting of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, is often referred to as macrophage-activation syndrome (MAS). The diagnosis of HLH is made on the basis of the presence of mutations associated with primary HLH (such as mutations in PRF1, UNC13D, or STX11) and/or clinical and laboratory criteria, such as fever, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridaemia, hypofibrinogenaemia, elevated serum levels of ferritin and liver enzymes, haemophagocytosis, low or absent NK cell activity, and/or elevated soluble IL-2 receptor levels113. Differentiation of primary HLH from MAS can be difficult, and distinction of secondary CAR T cell-related HLH\u2013MAS from CRS\u2013CRES can be even more challenging owing to the overlapping symptoms associated with these conditions16,29,37,112. Future studies to define the role of genetic testing and functional analyses of NK cells might help identify patients who are at a disproportionately higher risk of this complication of CAR T cell therapy30. Nevertheless, diagnostic criteria for this rare toxicity have been provided in the guidelines for the management of adult patients treated with CAR T cell therapy published by Neelapu et al.37 in this journal. Children can also be diagnosed with CAR T cell-related HLH\u2013MAS if they have a peak serum ferritin level >10,000 ng/ml during the CRS-risk period and develop any two of the following: grade \u22653 organ toxicities involving the liver, kidney, or lung; or haemophagocytosis in the bone marrow or other organs37. Patients who develop CAR T cell-related HLH\u2013MAS can be treated simultaneously with anti-IL-6 therapy and corticosteroids (Fig. 1); responses to anti-IL-6 therapy alone might not be as common as in patients with CRS alone33. In addition, although HLH\u2013MAS occurring after treatment with CAR T cells and other T cell-engaging therapies has typically been shown to resolve following administration of anti-IL-6 therapy and/or corticosteroids30,62,96, refractory cases can require additional therapy, including consideration of systemic and/or intrathecal therapy according to the HLH-2004 management guidelines113 or use of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra62,114 (Table 1). Further research is needed, however, to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of CAR T cell-related HLH\u2013MAS.",

Given that toxicity grading systems are likely to evolve over time, entry of primary variables seems more useful in the long term. Furthermore, many of these patients require intensive-care support, and therefore prospective collaborations with intensive-care registries, such as Virtual paediatric intensive-care unit (PICU) Systems (VPS)132, should be considered (Table 1).

We anticipate that advances in CAR T cell technology will improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of CRS\u2013CRES and facilitate the discovery of predictive biomarkers with which to identify patients requiring early intervention with available supportive care, which will subsequently lead to improved outcomes and reductions in the cost of this care, in addition to biomarkers for identifying in advance patients who are unlikely to respond.

Inpatient and outpatient nursing units, triage facilities, emergency-care departments, and intensive-care units all need available nursing staff that have completed all required competencies to care for patients treated with CAR T cells. These nurses can assist in the rapid recognition of CRS\u2013CRES and help avoid iatrogenic errors (for example, administration of steroids as a routine pre-medication).

Discharge protocols should ensure comprehensive education of the caregiver and patient about signs and symptoms of CRS and CRES, and the patient should also be given a wallet or REMS identification card for their specific CAR T cell product.
