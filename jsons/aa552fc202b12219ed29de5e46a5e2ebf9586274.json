            "text": "Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is commonly used to screen for pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) in neonates and young infants. However, in the absence of sufficient tricuspid regurgitation (TR), a ventricular septal defect (VSD), or a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) becomes challenging. Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) is an alternate parameter that is easy to obtain in almost all patients and does not require the presence of tricuspid valvar regurgitation or an anatomical cardiac defect. We sought to examine the correlation of PAAT with estimated SPAP by TTE and create an equation to estimate the SPAP using PAAT. We performed a retrospective review of TTEs performed on neonates and young infants (4 months of age or younger) at our institution between April 2017 and December 2018, along with the corresponding medical records. We included TTEs that provided estimation for SPAP and at least one PAAT measurement. During the study period, 138 TTEs performed on 82 patients met the inclusion criteria. Strong correlation was delineated between PAAT and SPAP estimated by the maximum velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation Doppler, correlation coefficient (r) = \u2212 0.83. Moderate correlation was detected between PAAT and SPAP estimated by PDA Doppler, r = \u2212 0.66. Utilizing the following equation \"SPAP = 82.6 \u2212 0.58 \u00d7 PAAT + RA mean pressure\", PAAT can be used to estimate SPAP in neonates and young infants. PAAT can be used as an alternative to TR jet to assess SPAP when the latter is absent or insufficient. Further studies are needed to verify the accuracy of this equation.",

            "text": "Pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) is a commonly encountered problem in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) [1, 2] . Right heart catheterization (RHC) remains the gold standard to diagnose PHTN. However, cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure and carries substantial risk of complications [3] [4] [5] [6] . In clinical practice, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is regularly ordered to screen for PHTN. Nevertheless, conventional TTE methods to screen for PHTN and assess systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) rely on the presence of sufficient tricuspid regurgitation (TR) or the presence of an anatomical cardiac defect (e.g., ventricular septal defect (VSD) and/or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)). Therefore, without these factors, TTE assessment of SPAP in infants cannot be performed [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) is a promising alternative tool for noninvasive estimation of SPAP. It is easy to obtain and doesn't require presence of TR or an anatomical cardiac defect. PAAT correlates inversely with the SPAP, mean pulmonary 1 3 artery pressure and calculated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Moreover, in the adult literature, PAAT-based equations have been created to estimate pulmonary artery pressure [11, 13, 14] . To our knowledge, only one previous study performed in children utilized PAAT to estimate SPAP by creating an equation derived from linear regression analysis [15] . No such equations have been purposed to assess SPAP exclusively in neonates and young infants who are historically at higher risk of developing cardiac catheterization related complications (CCRC) [6] .",

We used recorded blood pressure to estimate systolic pulmonary artery pressure when a good PDA and/or VSD Doppler were recorded. To further test the strength of PAAT with the different TTE methods used to estimate SPAP, we divided patients into three groups. Group 1: systolic pulmonary artery pressure estimated through maximum velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation (TRVmax), group II: SPAP estimated based on the peak gradient across the VSD, and group III: SPAP estimated based on the peak gradient across the PDA. To investigate whether adjusting to heart rate (HR) would increase the strength of correlations, we divided PAAT by the square root of the RR interval [16] . Because pulmonary pressure and systemic artery pressure are dynamic and consistently change, TTEs performed in the same patient at more than 24 h interval were included.",

It may present acutely shortly after birth, such as in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHTN) or more indolently as with PHTN associated with BPD [17] [18] [19] . Increased pulmonary arterial pressure and PVR resistance in infants with BPD have been described in multiple studies [18\u221223] . Cardiac catheterization remains the gold standard to establish the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. Unless there is contraindication to cardiac catheterization or the patient is severely ill requiring immediate initiation of therapy, it is required to perform right heart catheterization (with left heart catheterization in the initial evaluation) to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate the etiology, stratify the severity and determine acute vasodilator response (AVR). This approach helps in guiding medical therapy and provides individualized prognostic insight [21, 24, 25] . Moreover, after initiation of a new anti-PHTN treatment for few months, it is also recommended to repeat cardiac catheterization to assess the response to treatment and the progression of the disease [21] . Nevertheless, cardiac catheterization is not a risk-free procedure. In fact, patients with PHTN are a high-risk group for CCRC. Cardiac arrest is estimated to occur in 0.6-2% and the risk of a pulmonary hypertension crisis is nearly 5%. In addition, children with PHTN, especially young infants, inherently have higher risk of CCRC when compared with adults who carry the same diagnosis [3-5, 26, 27] . With the increased survival of the VLBW premature infants who commonly develop PHTN and are at high risk for CCRC, reliable surveillance for PHTN is needed in order to promptly identify and treat PHTN [28] [29] [30] .",

            "text": "Point of care bedside TTE is commonly ordered in young infants to screen for PHTN [2, 10, 24, 31] . Although TTE is not a replacement for RHC in diagnosing PHTN, it has a crucial role in guiding clinical decision making in sick infants. It provides valuable longitudinal and real time functional and hemodynamic information [31] . Unfortunately, conventional TTE cannot estimate SPAP accurately in a high number of infants, especially those with BPD [19, 30, 31] . Measuring continuous-wave Doppler of the TRVmax is the most popular TTE method to estimate SPAP non-invasively. Simply, applying the modified Bernoulli equation to the measured TRVmax and adding estimated mean right atrial pressure (which is usually 2-5 mmHg) allows the estimation of SPAP. TRVmax correlates strongly with the invasive SPAP measurements [30, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . However, this method requires sufficient TR to generate accurate Doppler wave form which is not present in all patients [10] [11] [12] . Furthermore, in young infants with a history of prematurity and BPD, sufficient TR jet to estimate the SPAP is detected only in 44% of the echocardiograms [19] . In our cohort, sufficient TR jet to estimate SPAP was identified in only 19 (13.8%) of the 138 performed TTEs. Factors associated with BPD (e.g., pulmonary hyperinflation with expansion of the thoracic cage) and change of the position of the heart may affect TTE's ability to detect the TR jet. However, the exact mechanism is yet to be determined [37] . The presence of anatomical defects, such as VSD and PDA, allows the measurement of the gradient across the anatomical defect providing an alternative method for the estimation of SPAP. These methods are restricted only to a small subset of patients who actually have the anatomical defect. In addition, the estimation of SPAP using these methods requires knowledge of the systemic arterial pressure at the time of measuring the gradient [7] [8] [9] 30] . In the absence of TR or anatomical defects that allow assessing the SPAP, other TTE findings, such as right ventricular hypertrophy and flattening of interventricular septum can be qualitative indicators of PHTN, even though these findings are neither sensitive nor specific. Thus, they cannot be used to categorize the severity of PHTN [30] .",

PAAT and the ratio of PAAT to the right ventricular ejection time (RVET) have been shown to be inversely correlated to PAP measured invasively during cardiac catheterization [15, 40] . Only few studies have described the inverse relationship of PAAT and PHTN in infancy [19, 41] . In our study, PAAT in infants with severe BPD was lower compared with that of infants with less severe BPD (p = 0.051). The insignificant P value appears to be related to the small sample size. However, our findings are in concurrence with the findings of Levy et al. [41] who reported that infants born prematurely exhibit an abnormally low PAAT compared with age matched term infants at 1-year of corrected gestation age. Moreover, preterm children with BPD showed even lower PAAT compared with those with no BPD. These findings suggest higher PVR in preterm infants that is more pronounced in those with BPD [41] . Levy et al. did not provide a PAAT derived equation to estimate SPAP and did not include newborn infants [41] . Despite the knowledge of the inverse relationship of PAAT and SPAP, the exact relationship between these two parameters, i.e., how to estimate SPAP by having PAAT, has not been described in neonates and young infants. In our study, a strong correlation was demonstrated between PAAT and SPAP estimated by the TR jet (r = \u2212 0.83). An equation was created to help estimate SPAP in newborns and young infants: SPAP = 82.6 \u2212 0.58 \u00d7 PAAT + RA mean pressure. This equation can be applied in the vast majority of infants (except those with pulmonary valve abnormalities), and is especially helpful in the absence of TR, VSD, or PDA. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate SPAP using PAAT exclusively in neonates and young infants.",

This can probably be explained by the inaccuracy of BP measurements rather than a real limitation of PAAT. In critically ill children, blood pressure measured by cuff does not correlate well with invasively measured blood pressure and cannot replace it when knowing that accurate blood pressure is crucial for minute-to-minute management [42, 43] . Similarly, in premature infants, especially at the lower systemic blood pressure range, noninvasive blood pressure measurements do not correlate well with invasive measurements and tend to significantly over-estimate BP, falsely reassuring the providing team [44] .",
