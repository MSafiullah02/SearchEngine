            "text": "Successful implementation of genetic materials as new therapeutic tools relies to a large degree on the appropriate delivery system. The efficiency of delivery by current methods still remains too low for many clinical applications or has raised serious safety concerns in experimental clinical trials. Therefore, new delivery agents are needed that combine a high degree of target specificity and efficient functional delivery with minimal immunogenicity. Ideally, such carriers could be easily loaded with a therapeutic cargo of choice e.g. nucleic acids, protein or drug. The first step towards efficient therapeutic delivery of siRNA or microRNAs (miRNAs) upon incorporation into the carrier vesicle is favorable association with and internalization of the transport carriers, by the target cell. Depending on their surface characteristics and size, these vesicles are taken up by recipient cells via different endocytic routes, including clathrin- or caveolae-dependent endocytosis, macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. However, not all routes of delivery and uptake will ultimately lead to effective functional cargo release in the desired intracellular compartment. RNAi-mediated therapeutics via naturally produced nano-vesicles known as exosomes have received much attention because of their apparent ability to incorporate functional miRNAs and to deliver them to target cells [1]. However, how these vesicles select for specific recipient cells in vivo remains incompletely understood. Interestingly, exosomes when released by certain virus infected cells, appear to be equipped with selected viral products that modify and potentially enhance their physiological function. Such exosomes may thus hold critical advantages that could be exploited for siRNA and/or miRNA targeting and delivery in vivo. Thus knowledge on viruses and how they exploit exosomes may aid in the engineering of potent nano-vehicles for specific and efficient delivery of genetic material.",

Subsequent electron-microscopy studies showed fusion events between late endosomes and the plasma membrane in multiple hematopoietic cell types suggesting the content of MVBs was released into the extracellular space as exosomes. Due to their origin exosomes are seen as a specialized type of microvesicles not to be confused with \u201cshedding\u201d vesicles that derive from the plasma membrane. Indeed proteomic analysis together with EM studies strongly suggested that ILVs are intracellular precursors of exosomes [20]. A function for exosomes in cell-cell communication was first proposed by Raposo et al. that showed exosomes from B cells can incorporate and transport functional antigen-presenting complexes [21]. We now know that exosomes are released by most if not all cell types, including dendritic cells, mast cells, T cells, B cells, epithelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, neuronal cells and many tumor cells [22]. Although exosomes are one of several groups of cell-secreted vesicles, they are relatively well-characterized and defined for their biophysical and biochemical properties compared to other secreted membrane vesicles.",

Proteomic analysis has demonstrated that exosomes contain defined sets of lipid and proteins and are carriers of nucleic acids, including messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding micro RNA (miRNA)[23], [24] (see Fig. 2\n). While most exosomes share a core set of proteins and lipids, their content is to some extent dependent on the cell type that produces them. It has been speculated that exosomes may derive from different MVB subsets producing distinct subtypes of exosomes. In agreement with this notion our own studies indicated that two exosomal proteins are localized in distinct endosome-like vesicles [25].",

Whether all these proteins contribute to their function remains to be seen, but there seems to be a clear conserved protein repertoire in exosomes across cell-types and species [27]. For example the endosomal proteins such as Alix and TSG101 have been identified in the majority of the exosomes studied for their protein content thus far. In addition, heat shock proteins, which are involved in protein trafficking, are frequently found in exosomes [28]. Exosomes are further enriched in tetraspanins, like CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82, which are important molecules for protein-protein interactions in cellular membranes. Tetraspanins bind many proteins, including integrins and MHC molecules [3], [29], [30], [31]. Specific Rab proteins a highly conserved family of small GTPases that functional as molecular switches and coordinate membrane traffic [32] are often observed in exosomes by mass-spectrometry. Exosomes are also rich in annexins, membrane trafficking proteins that are involved in fusion events. Furthermore cytoskeletal proteins like myosine, actin and tubulin are present in exosomes. Finally, metabolic enzymes, antigen presentation molecules, ribosomal proteins and signal transduction molecules are shown to be present in exosomes [26].",

            "text": "Besides selected sets of proteins, exosomes also incorporate (functional) nucleic acids, most notably small RNA molecules [33] presumably, due to a close intracellular interaction with RISC-assembly complexes situated at endo-lysosmal membranes [34]. Of all RNA molecules detected in exosomes, the class of 22nt long, non-coding miRNAs has received attention since the discovery that miRNAs can be functionally transferred to recipient cells [1], [24]. MiRNAs regulate gene expression by binding imperfectly to the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the target mRNA that results in translational repression of the mRNA into protein [35], [36]. This mechanism is somewhat different from siRNA mediated gene repression as siRNAs are perfectly complementary to their target sequence resulting in mRNA degradation [37]. In essence, miRNA regulated repression of genes is reversible while siRNA mediated repression is not. The biogenesis of miRNAs starts in the nucleus with transcription of DNA by RNA polymerase II into primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) [38]. The pri-miRNA must contain hairpin stem loop structures of approximately 33 basepairs, which is critical for DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region Gene 8 (DGCR8) protein binding. Thereafter pri-miRNA is cleaved into pre-micro RNA by the Drosha\u2013DGCR8 microprocessor complex formed of RNase III enzyme Drosha and the DGCR8 protein. The formed pre-miRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 in complex with Ran-GTP, where the pre-miRNA is further cleaved into the 22 nucleotide miRNA by the Dicer-TRBP-PACT complex, consisting of the RNase III enzyme Dicer, transactivation responsive RNA-binding protein (TRBP) and p53-associated cellular protein (PACT). The functional strand is then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by Argonaute (AGO) proteins, where the miRNA guides RISC to silence target mRNA. The passenger strand, however, is degraded [5], [39], [40].",

For many viruses for instance their specific entry route defines its life cycle. For one, it is important for a virus to either avoid direct uptake to lysosomes, a process called endosomal escape.

For instance, exosomes that express intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) can bind lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1) expressed by DCs and T cells. Furthermore, exosomes appear to carry phosphatidylserine, which can bind to phosphatidylserine receptors like T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain protein 1 (TIM1) and TIM4 [3]. In addition MHCII positive exosomes could specifically target CD8 + T cells whereas MHCI positive exosomes may target CD4 + T cells. Finally, there is evidence that selected galectins, carried by exosomes from (EBV-infected) B cells can function as specific receptors for TIM(3) molecules on target (T) cells. Despite these points of evidence there is much to be learned about the mechanisms by which (subtypes of) exosomes and their genetic material are transported into recipient cells and whether this transport is functional. Because of the apparent similarities between exosomes and certain RNA viruses, it is useful to briefly revisit how viruses can target their cell of interest and discuss whether targeting of exosomes may function in similar ways.",

Non-viral vectors, like cationic liposomes, are less toxic and immunogenic than the viral vectors. The cationic liposomes have been improved for a more specific gene transfer. The use of targeting ligands, like transferrin, can improve cellular delivery of cationic liposomes. Furthermore endosomal escape, which is required for the transfer of functional siRNAs or miRNAs is facilitated by lipids such as DOPE [50], [51]. However specific organ or tissue targeting of these vesicles remains a big hurdle. In addition, the short lifetime and aggregation of cationic liposomes are problematic for efficient delivery of genetic material that could potentially be overcome by the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) PEG [52]. PEG modification could stabilize liposomes and might protect the siRNA from serum degradation, making them more suitable for RNA delivery although this has not yet been clinically validated.",

The best known examples are virosomes and virus-like particles (VLPs). Whereas virosomes are vesicles which consist of unilamellar phospholipid bilayer with incorporated virus derived proteins to allow virosomes to fuse with target cells [53], VLPs are made by the transfection of a production cell line with a single plasmid encoding viral structural proteins. Self-assembly of capsid proteins generates non-infectious particles packed with bio-engineered cargo [54]. VLPs are produced by more than 30 different viruses [55] and these VLP have shown to successfully transfer nucleic acids [56], [57], [58] However, they exhibit limited packaging capacity and they can be immunogenic [57]. One interesting example of successful combinatory method is by coating liposomes with inactivated hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ). HVJ liposomes have two important envelope proteins that are involved in membrane fusion and after fusion they can introduce DNA directly into the cytoplasm [59].",

            "text": "Many similarities in biochemical composition, biogenesis and cellular release of exosomes and retroviruses have been mentioned and studied in detail. This has led some to hypothesize that retroviruses may have evolved to utilize a preexisting host endosomal-exosome biogenesis pathway for the formation of infectious virus and their egress [62]. Retroviruses like exosomes contain RNA; whereas the RNA of retroviruses makes up their entire genome, exosomes may contain a diverse population of RNA molecules including miRNA and mRNA [4], [63]. HIV-1 assembly appears to take place at the late endosomal membrane of macrophages, while in T cells, HIV seems to preferentially bud from the plasma membrane. Strikingly, even assembly of HIV at the plasma membrane shares similarities with endosomal budding, for instance the recruitment of ESCRT machinery is required for efficient budding [63]. The fact that exosomes as well as retroviruses require high levels of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (both contain a common glycan coat with high mannose and complex N-linked glycans) suggest similar requirements for particle assembly. Detection of endosomal markers, such as CD63, in association with macrophage-derived virions again suggests that viral assembly and budding takes a route similar to exosomal release by MVB [78]. Indeed, MVB proteins like E class proteins participate in HIV budding and probably also in other (retro) viruses [79], [80].",

These exosomes from RV-infected cells showed a higher T-cell inhibition than exosomes from non-infected cells however no viral products were detected in these vesicles [81]. This clearly suggests that the content of exosomes of RV- infected cells is different from the exosomes of non-infected cells. Similar findings in HIV-infected cells indicate specific incorporation and release of the host-encoded anti-viral protein APOBEC3G which is abundantly secreted via exosomes [4], [82]. In addition, we have shown that EBV-infected B cells secrete LMP1 via exosomes that have immunodulatory properties on T cells and DCs [83], [84], [85]. Finally, we were first in demonstrating that virus-infected cells package virus-encoded RNAs into exosomes that are delivered into non-infected recipient cells. Specifically, we showed that high copy numbers of EBV encoded BART-miRNAs are transported via exosomes and that these are functional in multiple recipient cells including primary monocyte-derived DCs. Importantly, we also observed transfer of a subset of viral miRNAs from infected to non-infected cells in humans [1] and proposed that exosomes may be designed to deliver small RNA because of their specialized biogenesis and presumed entry route [33]. These observations have later been confirmed by others [60], suggesting that viral factors, once incorporated into the appropriate delivery vesicles such as endogenously produced exosomes, could be exploited for therapeutic RNAi-approaches with increased targeting efficacy.",

These non-coding inhibitory small RNAs are believed to have originated as an innate defense mechanism against viral infections. But soon it was discovered that introduction of these small RNAs into mammalian cells lead to specific inhibition of gene expression. This raised the possibility that RNAi could be exploited in vivo for the targeting of disease-causing genes [86], [87], [88]. However, siRNAs are hydrophilic and cannot cross membranes on their own. Thus \u2018naked\u2019 siRNAs cannot reach target tissues in vivo. Moreover, siRNAs have a very short half-life in the circulation due to the presence of RNAse activity in blood. However chemically synthesized siRNAs and vector-encoded siRNAs may have improved molecular integrity in vivo, resulting in more stable delivery [88]. Indeed Bitko et al. showed that pulmonary infection in mice caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) can be prevented with intranasal siRNAs [89]. Furthermore RNAi can inhibit neuropathic pain in a rat disease model by injecting siRNAs intrathecally [90] and can inhibit viral replication of many viruses in vitro and inhibits the survival and growth of tumor cells [91]. Resistance against RNAi in fighting viral infection has been documented indicating that a combinatorial approach against multiple conserved sequences is likely required to prevent the emergence of RNAi-resistant escape viruses [92].",

            "text": "Although siRNAs are potentially very useful and potent therapeutics against many diseases, delivery needs to be optimized [93], [94]. Optimal delivery of these small, hydrophilic siRNAs still remains a major challenge. The current focus is to prevent premature degradation of the siRNAs by serum nucleases [95] and to improve specific cell targeting and to maximize subsequent RNAi loading into the RISC complexes of the target cells [86]. Antibody molecules can be used to deliver siRNAs to specific target cells via cell-surface receptors [96]. Ligand-associated siRNAs also recognize specific antigens on the target cells and are taken up upon binding. Moreover several delivery vesicles like nanoparticles, viruses and liposomes are used to prevent degradation of siRNAs by serum nucleases. Attenuated viral vectors are also frequently used for siRNA delivery, because they provide stable source of nucleic acids for RNAi machinery. However, current siRNA carriers can be cleared by preexisting antibodies, opsonins, complement or coagulation factors [97]. Furthermore the viral vectors can insert viral DNA into the chromosomal DNA, causing genetic dysregulation [98]. Therefore artificial non-viral vesicles are preferred by some such as like lipid nanoparticles that appear very efficient in siRNA delivery. However, liposomes and lipid nanoparticles are also sensitive to be phagocytosed after binding with opsonins or complement factors [99]. Moreover siRNAs in lipid nanoparticles cannot easily escape from the endosome, which is necessary for loading of the siRNAs in the cytoplasmic RISC complexes [86], [98]. Polymeric nanoparticles can escape from endosomes but interact with serum proteins that can increase clearance. Furthermore these particles cause \u2018rupture\u2019 of endosomes that enhances endosomal escape but also leads to the co-release of cathepsin B, a strong trigger for undesired inflammation [98]. Polymeric nanoparticles may also accumulate in unintended tissues thereby limiting their effect on the target tissue of interest [98]. Because of these limitations, alternative more efficient approaches are still needed and under development. An attractive alternative approach for safe and efficient siRNA delivery in vivo even to tissues such as the brain is the use of endogenous cell-produced exosomes as (non-viral) delivery vesicles [24], [100]. A major advantage of naturally produced exosomes over lipid (nano) particles or viral-vectors is that they apparently can carry functional siRNAs and/or miRNAs across the blood\u2013brain barrier [100].",

Still much is to be learned about how exosomes operate in vivo, their method of action, specific targeting and their kinetics. Indeed, large scale exosome production and isolation still remains a challenge and ultracentrifugation is time consuming that may hamper efforts to use exosomes as vaccines. Moreover the composition of exosomes is not fully elucidated especially at the RNA level and thus artificial production of these naturally occurring vesicles with complex composition may be more difficult than originally perceived. However, if one considers that the HIV genome is 9.8 kb and packaged within a vesicle similar in size to exosomes, one could potentially pack 500 copies of miRNAs in one single exosome. Balaj et al. estimated that one cell may produce between 10 and 30.000 exosomes a day, [101] one could imagine that production of exosomes carrying sufficient therapeutic RNA molecules is certainly feasible at large scale.",

            "text": "It is becoming apparent that cells do not secrete one but multiple subpopulations of exosomes that probably consist of distinct sets of proteins and lipids. Several important proteins, like tetraspanins, annexins and heat shock proteins are found in all exosomes and may have a \u2018core\u2019 function. However distinct tetraspanins may play an important role in target cells selection [102] but many details remain unclear. Viral proteins maybe used to enhance the uptake and delivery of exosomes by specific target cells as elegantly shown recently by Alvarez et al. [100]. Importantly, exosomes have already proven their biological relevance as cancer vaccines, whereby dendritic cell-derived exosomes can be used to induce immune responses. This is fully compatible with the idea that exosomes are candidate delivery vehicles for therapeutic RNAs. In addition, virus modified exosomes seem to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory properties, that when fully understood could be exploited clinically. Other intriguing possibilities are that targeted miRNA delivery via exosomes could be exploited for instance by overcoming drug resistance. For example, the overproduction of ABC transporters has been documented to cause drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [103]. The resistance in HCC due to upregulation of ABC transporter expression is mediated by the downregulation of several tumor suppressor miRNAs. Reintroduction of these miRNAs in the cancer cells may restore the drug sensitivity of these cells. Since there are several viruses that specifically target liver cells, it is not a stretch to engineer exosomes carrying a virus-derived targeting molecule specific for liver (cancer) epithelial cells carrying therapeutic miRNAs as cargo. In conclusion, these tiny vesicles may have a big future in drug delivery.",

The process of internal budding leads to an encapsulation of cytoplasmic content from the cell of origin, including host and/or viral components such as nucleic acids (e.g. small non-coding RNA and mRNA) and proteins (e.g. proteins situated in the cytoplasm, membrane bound proteins, viral (glyco)proteins). The exact mechanism of how nucleic acids are packaged into exosomes is unclear and maybe due to simple (random) inclusion of molecules or by active and selective packaging of certain nucleic acid species such as miRNAs. Induced exosome release and selective cargo incorporation are evident in virus-infected cells. When released to the extracellular environment, exosomes have the same orientation as the cell membrane and have been shown to display many of the surface markers from their cell of origin. While incorporation of viral proteins into exosomes appears to be selective; the criterion determining their exosomal faith is yet to be defined. (Nucleus, N; Epstein - Barr virus, EBV).",
