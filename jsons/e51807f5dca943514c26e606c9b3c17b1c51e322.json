Surgery for group 2 patients should be carefully evaluated together with the anesthesiologist team, to balance the risk-benefit ratio of a surgical treatment at this time. Group 3 and 4 patients should undergo laboratory testing and chest CT scan to exclude a developing infection. 17, 18 Early identification and isolation of infected patients minimize virus transmission to other patients and to healthcare professionals. 1 Patients included the three first groups must be kept in a single room, and disinfection and isolation measure have to be put in action. Contact and droplet isolation precautions through gown, gloves, head cap and facial FFP2 (N95) mask must be taken. 5, 11 Also patient must wear surgical facemasks or mask without exhalation valves. 6, 11 In the absence clinical information or swab test, those patients needing emergent neurosurgical procedure should be considered as Group 1-2 patients and require the same perioperative management as well. 3",

In these patients it has also to be considered the presence of leukopenia, particularly lymphocytopenia. 19 -Group 3, High-risk cases: These patients are without symptoms and do not shown laboratory or radiological features suggestive for COVID-19. They have had contact with people who are positive or suspected, which have had clinical manifestations of the coronavirus.-Group 4, Low-risk: These patients have no positive history of contact; negative RT-PCR test, and they have no symptoms and no manifestations of COVID-19 at chest CT scan.17,18,20",
