            "text": "Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease associated with bronchial hyper-responsiveness and reversible airflow limitation. In addition to airway inflammation, structural changes, termed airway remodelling, are also evident within the airways1 and are thought to result from chronic inflammation. Another feature of asthma is acute exacerbations. Respiratory viral infections are frequently associated with exacerbations of asthma,2\u20134 but the association between exacerbations of asthma and airway remodelling is poorly understood. The most frequently isolated pathogens during viral infection-induced exacerbations are RNA viruses including rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial viruses.2\u20134 RNA virus synthesizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during viral replication and dsRNA activates the innate immune system through several receptors including Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic-acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5).5,6 As a result dsRNA induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and should be considered as one of the factors potentially responsible for virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

Most of the RNA viruses that cause respiratory infection, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, have long single-stranded RNA. These RNA viruses produce long dsRNA during their replication. Therefore, TLR3 and MDA-5 are considered as the main receptors of dsRNA during respiratory viral infections.
