If the blood sample is from a positive patient, the activated immune molecules in the blood such as antibodies, complement proteins and others will react with the nanoparticle pseudo virus, leading to nanoparticle aggregate formation.

In this study, we applied this test for Zika virus infection detection. We tested blood plasma samples from 85 Zika positive patients, 40 Dengue positive patients, 10 Chikungunya positive patients, and 78 nonpatient control samples collected from both endemic and non-endemic locations. The study shows that the new test has a higher sensitivity compared to some existing commercial tests in the market, while maintaining a similar specificity. Within 7 days from the symptom onset, the new test can detect 43% of the infected patients while a commercial anti-Zika IgM test detects only 26% of the infected patients. Within 14 days from the symptom onset, our new test detects 73% of the infected patients while the same commercial anti-Zika IgM test detects 53% of the 2 infected patients. The test is extremely simple, easy to develop, with test results obtained within minutes. This new test platform may be potentially adapted for the detection and diagnosis of a wide range of viral infectious diseases, for example, the currently ongoing COVID-19.",

Almost every time when such an outbreak occurs, there is a lack of rapid diagnostic tests for timely screening and diagnosis of infected patients [3, 4] , and this problem has been causing great challenges in early control of emerging infectious diseases. This situation has just occurred in China, the first epidemic center of COVID-19 within few months ago, and now the US and many other countries are facing the same problem. Between 2015 to 2017, the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil and its subsequent spread to the whole continental America and the Caribbean Islands is another example manifesting the needs for rapid diagnostic tests for high-risk emerging infectious diseases. At the early stage of Zika outbreak, the lack of rapid tests caused similar delays in diagnosing positive patients. ZIKV infection is linked to pregnancy complications including microcephaly, central nervous system malformation, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, hydranencephaly, and placental insufficiency [5] [6] [7] . The long waiting time for the testing results not only caused much anxiety among pregnant women or women at pregnancy age, but also delayed decision process that can be very critical for the health of both infected mothers and unborn babies.",

            "text": "Here we report the development of an extremely simple and rapid blood test, D2Dx\u2122 test, for virus infection detection, screening and diagnosis. Although the study we present here was focused on ZIKV infection, our new approach may be potentially adapted for other virus infections, including the currently occurring COVID-19. The design and the process to perform the test are illustrated in Figure 1 . The test uses a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) pseudo virus pathogen to detect active humoral immune responses from the infected patients' blood plasma or serum samples. The AuNP pseudo virus pathogen is made by simply coating a citrate-AuNPs with a virus lysate solution. In the case of ZIKV detection, the AuNP surface is coated with a solution of ZIKV lysate. Proteins, especially the envelope proteins, along with lipids and membranes, and other envelope components will adsorb and assemble spontaneously to the surface of the AuNPs to form a virus \"envelope-like\" protein corona on the AuNP surface ( Figure 1A ). This nanoparticle pseudo virus particle, when mixed with a blood plasma or serum sample, activated immune molecules including IgM, IgG antibodies, complement proteins and potentially other molecules in the blood from the infected patients will interact with the AuNP pseudo virus, mimicking the in vivo humoral immune response. This immune reaction will lead to AuNP aggregate formation, as illustrated in Figure 1B . The AuNP aggregates can be detected and quantified using a well-known particle sizing technique called dynamic light scattering (DLS). A test score is obtained by calculating the ratio of the average particle size of the assay solution, D 2 , versus the average particle size of the original AuNP pseudo virus solution, D 1 .",

Rather, it is detecting the humoral immune response that would occur in vivo. In a real biological body, immune responses are extremely complicated processes involving collective and highly orchestrated reactions and interactions between and among various molecules from the immune system and the invading pathogens [13] . The D2Dx\u2122 test is designed to capture and detect this humoral immune response. Our recently reported studies have shown that when a gold nanoparticle material is mixed with blood serum samples, the blood serum interacts with the nanoparticle as if it is a pathogen, and three most important immune-related proteins, IgG and IgM antibody, and complement proteins, are directly involved in such interactions [14] .",

When selecting negative control samples to validate new diagnostic tests for infectious diseases, one needs to be cautious about where the samples are collected. For epidemic and pandemic viral infectious diseases, many people may contract the virus, develop an immune response in the body, however, never develop any symptom. The best negative control samples should be collected from a non-epidemic region, where there is a great probability that the population has never been exposed to the virus. For this reason, we obtained blood samples collected in a location at the United States where no case of Zika infection was ever reported. As shown in Table 3, among 40 samples, only 3 samples showed test scores above the cutoff value. Therefore, the false positive rate of the D2Dx\u2122 test on true negative samples is 7.5%. As explained earlier, it is possible that the three false positive samples were from donors who have natural immunity to Zika virus, or they have been vaccinated or infected with a virus that may cross react with Zika virus.",

These samples were collected from donors that had not shown Zika-related symptoms. These samples were tested negative by both Aptima RT-PCR test and InBios anti-Zika IgM test. However, a significant number of these samples were tested positive (61%) using the DiaPro anti-Zika IgG test (Table 6 ). Our study revealed a surprisingly high positive rate of 63% from this group of samples. We believe the positive samples from the Zika-asymptomatic cohort are most likely from patients who have been infected with Zika during the outbreak between January to August 2016, but had not had clinical symptoms. This hypothesis requires additional investigation. InBios anti-Zika IgM test is a test that detects the specific anti-Zika IgM antibodies. IgM antibodies are produced at very early stage of infection, and the antibody isotype switch from IgM to IgG usually occurs with the progression of the humoral immune response development [18, 19] . The D2Dx\u2122 test, while detecting the overall humoral immune response to a viral infection, does not distinguish specific immune molecules and does not detect specific antibodies or antibody isotypes such as IgM or IgG. It is known that anti-virus IgG antibodies can be present in the body for weeks, months or years after the infection is completely resolved and the patient is fully recovered [20] . It has also been suggested that the end of Zika endemics and epidemics is achieved through the establishment of herd immunity [21, 22] . This means, only after the majority of a population in an endemic and epidemic region is infected, the epidemics will stop. With all these confounding factors, it is not surprising that a high positive rate was detected from blood samples collected from an epidemic region even after the epidemic spread has stopped.",

Data shows that the new test can have significantly higher sensitivity than the traditional serology test, while maintain similar specificity. Although our current study was focused on Zika, the technology platform can be easily adapted for other virus infectious diseases. The development of the AuNP pseudo virus particle is an extremely simple process as shown in our study, by mixing a virus lysate solution with a citrate AuNP solution. The AuNP pseudo virus reagent can be made in situ for immediate testing or pre-made for later testing. The test involves a single step of mixing the AuNP pseudo virus solution with an untreated, undiluted blood plasma sample, with results obtained in minutes. Finally, we want to mention here that although all of the results reported here are based on average particle size measurement of the assay solution using dynamic light scattering, we have preliminary evidence showing that the results of this new test may also be read using a simple colorimeter, which costs no more than a few hundred US dollars per unit; or on a high throughput automatic microplate reader platform. It is well known that AuNPs, upon aggregate formation, change color due to their surface plasmon resonance wavelength change, and this change can be monitored using a small colorimeter or a UV-Vis spectrophotometer microplate reader.

In addition to Zika positive samples and negative control samples, we also tested certain numbers of other flavivirus positive samples, including Dengue and Chikungunya positive samples, to determine the cross reactivity of the current test for ZIKV detection. The positive status of Dengue or Chikungunya samples were confirmed using InBios anti-Dengue or anti-Chikungunya IgM antibody test. We obtained and tested the following samples in this study: (1) 85 confirmed ZIKV symptomatic and positive samples collected in Dominican Republic between late 2015 to middle 2016; (2) 40 negative control samples collected in the United States from a state in December 2017 where no Zika case was ever reported; (3) 10 Chikungunya-positive samples collected in Dominican Republic in February 2015, prior to the report of Zika outbreak; (4) 25 Denguepositive samples from Dominican Republic between August to December 2015 and 15 Denguepositive samples from Peru in May 2017; (5) 38 ZIKV-asymtomatic samples collected in Dominican Republic towards the end of the Zika endemic in the region, in September 2016.",

In this study, we included two flavivirus infections, Dengue and Chikungunya, for cross reactivity study.10 Chikungunya positive samples collected in Dominican Republic in February 2015 when Zika case had not been reported in the region yet, were analyzed. Among the 10 samples, only one has a D2Dx\u2122 test score exceeding 5.0. Therefore, the false positive rate from the Chikungunya positive samples is 10%. For cross reactivity study with Dengue infection, we obtained Dengue positive samples from two locations: 25 samples from Dominican Republic, collected from August 2015 to December 2015; and 15 samples from Peru in May 2017. The first case of Zika in Dominican Republic was reported in January 2016. Around May 2017, Peru did not have a Zika outbreak. From the analysis of the 25 Dengue positive samples from Dominican Republic, we found a 40% positive rate using D2Dx\u2122 test, while the Peru sample group only showed a 13.3% positive rate. We believe some of the Dengue positive samples from Dominican Republic may be actually Zika positive. Our suggestion is partially supported by the InBios testing results. Most of these samples from Dominican Republic were tested as \"Possible Zika positive\" or \"Presumptive other flavivirus\" based on InBios anti-Zika IgM test. Peru samples, on the other hand, were confirmed by both Aptima Zika RT-PCR test and InBios anti-Zika IgM test as negative, and we found a much lower false positive rate of 13.3% from the Peru sample cohort.",
