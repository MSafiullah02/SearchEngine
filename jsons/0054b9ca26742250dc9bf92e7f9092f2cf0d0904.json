We conduct different experiments considering various dimensions of language such as vocabulary, psychometric attributes and emotional indicators. Our findings reveal that positive instances of mental disorders show significant differences from control individuals in the way they write and express emotions in social media. However, there are not quantifiable differences that could be used to distinguish one mental disorder from each other.",

In this respect, the Early Risk Prediction on the Internet (eRisk) [14, 15] , as well as the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) [9] workshops were the first to propose benchmarks to bring together many researchers to address the automatic detection of mental disorders in online social media.",

Moreover, the models and features used in those studies could be analysed and motivated more deeply. Therefore, we argue that even though achieving an effective performance is important, being able to track and visualise the development of the mental disorder also is.

Moreover, the proportion of messages using words related with positive emotions (posemo) is larger than negative (negemo) ones, even for the positive classes. Such circumstance could be related to the fact that English words, as they appear in natural language, are biased towards positivity [13] . Except for categories we and she/he differences reach statistical significance using Welch two sample t-test (p-value < 0.001) from each corresponding control group in Fig. 2(a) . No significant differences between depression, anorexia and self-harm were found for any of the LIWC categories analysed in Fig. 2(a) . Figure 2 (b) depicts categories related to biological process. In essence, this category includes words directly associated with the body and its main functions. We note that individuals within the anorexia group show a certainly different behaviour compared with depression and self-harm groups. Intuitively, this result is expected, given that anorexia is characterised by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of weight. Overall, people with anorexia place a high value on controlling their weight and shape, using extreme efforts that tend to significantly interfere with their lives. Therefore, it is reasonable that such individuals talk more about themes related with their body and its function. Statistical significance (p-value < 0.001) between individuals suffering from anorexia and those affected by depression is achieved for categories body, health and ingest. While only for the latter category the differences are statistically significant when comparing self-harm and anorexia users.",

The use of such words is not significantly different with respect to anorexia and self-harm groups. This suggest that those words are also frequently used by users affected by anorexia or self-harm. The same situation was observed when considering the set of absolutist terms 13 derived from the work of Al-Mosaiwi et al. [1] , who concluded that the elevated use of absolutist words is a marker specific to anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Figure 3 depicts for each class the average number of documents that contain at least one word associated with a particular emotion, including the polarity (positive or negative). We note considerable differences on the expression of emotions between positive and their respective controls. One way to interpret such results is that on average positive users tend to share emotions more regularly than control individuals.",

Studying and visualising such dimensions, we discovered several interesting differences that could help a predictive system and a health practitioner to determine whether someone is affected by a mental disorder. Across different mental disorders, however, we could not find any significant indicators. Therefore, we can conclude that analysing social media posts could help a system identify people that are more likely to be diagnosed a mental disorder. On the other hand, determining the exact disorder is a much more difficult task, requiring expert judgement. Also, we found that psychometric attributes and emotional expression provides a quantifiable way to differentiate between individuals affected by mental disorders from healthy ones. The study we presented in this work has high practical impact since research should be steered towards building new metrics that can correlate with a disease before traditional symptoms arise and which clinicians can use as leading indicators of traditional later-onset symptoms.",

Also, it would be interesting to uncover the differences in people's behaviour on different social media platforms. Based on the restrictions, objectives, and features people tend to behave differently on different platforms. Therefore, it is of high importance to see if our findings can be generalised to other social media platforms or not. Also, studying other modalities of data such as video and image can be very effective in detecting people with mental disorders [24] .",
