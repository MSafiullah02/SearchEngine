            "text": "Cytomegaloviruses are beta-herpesviruses which establish life-long infections in their hosts. Several findings have implicated CD13, also known as aminopeptidase N (APN), in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and pathogenesis. In a series of bone marrow transplant patients, CD13/APN-specific autoantibodies were found only in patients with confirmed CMV disease after transplant and were highly associated with later development of chronic graft vs. host disease (cGVHD) (Soderberg et al., 1996a, Soderberg et al., 1996b). Patients seropositive for CMV but negative for the presence of virus did not develop anti-CD13/APN antibodies or cGVHD (Soderberg et al., 1996b). On the molecular level, several groups have shown that human CMV incorporates host cell proteins, one of which is CD13/APN, into its viral envelope (Homman-Loudiyi et al., 2003, Michelson et al., 1989, Naucler et al., 1996, Wright et al., 1995). Some monoclonal antibodies raised against CD13/APN can neutralize human CMV viral particles, and immunoblots of purified human CMV virions detect CD13/APN (Soderberg et al., 1993a). When viral particles are labeled with immunogold-anti-CD13 antibodies, the immunogold particles are later seen on the surface of infected cells (Giugni et al., 1996). Consistent with viral sequestration of CD13/APN, cell surface CD13/APN is down-regulated after human CMV infection in fibroblasts (Phillips et al., 1998). Association of CD13/APN with the viral particle has been suggested as a mechanism for the generation of anti-CD13/APN antibodies after CMV infection by autoimmunization (Naucler et al., 1996). That virus-associated CD13/APN is essential for HCMV infection is suggested by anti-CD13 antibody inhibition of infection (Soderberg et al., 1993a); however, human neuroblastoma cells lacking CD13 expression were susceptible to HCMV infection (Watanabe, 1998), and recently the epidermal growth factor receptor has been shown to be an important mediator of HCMV entry into cells (Wang et al., 2003).",

It exists as a heavily glycosylated homodimer with a constitutively active proteinase activity external to the plasma membrane (Riemann et al., 1999). In addition to numerous tissue-specific functions, CD13/APN serves as a major receptor for type I coronaviruses (Breslin et al., 2003, Yeager et al., 1992), including possibly the SARS virus (Yu et al., 2003). More recently, CD13/APN has been shown to be an important mediator of angiogenesis when expressed on endothelial cells of nascent blood vessels (Bhagwat et al., 2001). Antibodies raised against CD13/APN and inhibitors of aminopeptidase activity both block angiogenesis in models of neovascularization (Pasqualini et al., 2000). This may have significance with regard to CMV, since CMV infection is associated with many chronic vascular diseases (Borchers et al., 1999, Hamamdzic et al., 2002, Nieto et al., 1996, Pandey and LeRoy, 1998). CMV-induced anti-CD13/APN antibodies may represent one mechanism by which the virus initiates vascular pathology.",

Groups of 4\u20136 animals of each of these strains were infected with 105 PFU MCMV by IP injection, which is a sublethal dose in adult animals for all strains. Serum was collected after 14 days and analyzed by ELISA for IgG antibodies against MCMV and mouse CD13/APN. All strains had similar levels of IgG antibodies directed against MCMV (Fig. 1\n). However, anti-CD13/APN antibodies were detected only in the sera from ICR and 129S-IFNgR\u2212/\u2212 mice, and no detectable antibodies against CD13 were found in sera from CBA or B6 hybrid mice. Anti-CD13 antibodies in humans were reported in people who developed HCMV viremia while in an immunocompromised state. In order to test whether an immunocompromised state would be associated with induction of higher levels anti-CD13 antibodies in mice, cyclosporine A was used to induce an immunocompromised state in ICR mice. Three groups of 6 ICR mice were treated with either cyclosporine A alone, cyclosporine A and 105 PFU MCMV, or 105 PFU MCMV + mock cyclosporine A injections. Mice treated with cyclosporine A and MCMV had increased signs of illness over those given MCMV alone (not shown). However, levels of antibodies to both MCMV and CD13 were not significantly different between the two groups (Fig. 2\n).",

NIH 3T3, 3T12, and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) are all fibroblast in phenotype. Py-41 and SVEC-4 cells are mouse endothelial cell lines immortalized by the polyoma T antigen and the SV40 T-antigen, respectively (Dubois et al., 1991, O'Connell and Edidin, 1990). In an assay of MCMV progeny production after inoculation at low multiplicity of infection, marked differences were seen between cell lines in susceptibility to productive MCMV infection (Fig. 3A). Peak MCMV titers in supernatants from the three fibroblast lines were close to 106 PFU/ml, while SVEC-4 cells produced 105 PFU/ml, and Py-41 cells produced less than 1000 PFU/ml. Similar relative results were seen in a plaque assay on the five cell lines (Fig. 4\n).",

Cells were plated at 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates for subsequent assays. To compare amounts of cell-surface CD13/APN exposed to MCMV in a standard inoculation with subsequent plaque formation, parallel sets of 6 wells of each cell type were assayed for APN enzyme activity, or inoculated with MCMV-lacZ and incubated a further 48 h, followed by staining and counting of plaques. Three dilutions of MCMV-lacZ virus were used in three sets of 6 wells to detect the range of susceptibilities observed. There was no correlation between CD13/APN expression and MCMV plaque formation (Fig. 4). CD13/APN enzyme activity was similar on all five cell lines whereas plaque formation and progeny virus production were markedly different, especially between endothelial and fibroblast cells. Whether or not CD13/APN is necessary for MCMV infection cannot be determined from this experiment since none of the murine cell lines tested were negative for CD13/APN, however, CD13 expression is clearly not sufficient for productive MCMV infection of Py-41 endothelial cells.",

Neither preincubation of antibody with virus nor antibody with host cells reduced plaque formation (Figs. 5A and B).

Cells were infected with an MOI of approximately 20, or mock infected with an equivalent concentration of salivary gland homogenate from uninfected mice. In contrast to human fibroblasts, all three mouse fibroblast lines had slightly (10\u201330%) increased APN cell surface activity 18 h after infection, while mouse endothelial cell lines Py-41 and SVEC-4 had slightly (3\u20139%) decreased APN activity (Fig. 6\n). At 72 h, cell death was apparent in all infected wells, and APN activity was reduced compared to mock-infected wells, however, APN activity per well was increased compared to 18 h post-infection in all cases due to increases in cell number (not shown). Whole cell ELISA gave similar results, except that differences between infected and non-infected cells were even smaller (not shown). Therefore, unlike human CMV infection, MCMV infection seems to have only a small effect if any on CD13/APN expression in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which varies according to cell type.",

In contrast, CBA and CBA/B6 hybrids are known to be genetically resistant to MCMV-induced mortality. MCMV resistance in mice is determined largely by the gene cmv1, which encodes Ly49H, an NK cell receptor which is activated by the MCMV protein m157 (Arase et al., 2002, Lee et al., 2002, Swihart et al., 1995). MCMV-resistant mouse strains have peak spleen viral titers that are 2\u20133 logs lower and LD50 doses that are 1\u20132 logs higher than susceptible strains. CBA and C57BL/6 mice express Ly49H on their NK cells and are resistant whereas 129S mice do not express Ly49H and are susceptible. The ICR mice were not genotyped for cmv1 and were intermediate in their susceptibility to MCMV morbidity, as well as autoantibody production. This suggests that high spleen titers may be associated with development of anti-CD13 antibodies. MHC type does not seem to be correlated with anti-CD13 antibody production in our experiments, since the haplotype H-2b is shared by both productive 129S and non-productive C57BL/6 hybrid strains.",

It is possible that a more comprehensive array of anti-murine CD13/APN antibodies would have detected CD13/APN in MCMV particles or have been able to neutralize MCMV infectivity, however, APN enzymatic assays also failed to detect a difference between virus and control lysates. Cell-surface CD13/APN also did not correlate with MCMV susceptibility.

With regard to the mechanisms of their induction, it has been proposed that these antibodies are directed against viral antigens which by coincidence resemble host cellular proteins (molecular mimicry), or that virus-induced tissue damage results in immunological processing and recognition of self-antigens normally sequestered from immune surveillance (Lawson, 2000, Naucler et al., 1996). In this study, several factors argue against a simple case of molecular mimicry. Although human and mouse CD13/APN are 76% identical at the amino acid level (Chen et al., 1996), HCMV and MCMV share less homology, CD13/APN is glycosylated and genetically polymorphic (Vijgen et al., 2004, Wentworth and Holmes, 2001), and predicted MHC presentable peptides differ with MHC haplotype and species. Therefore, the likelihood of a single epitope common to both hosts, both viruses, and presentable by several MHC types seems small. Determination of the CD13/APN epitopes recognized by the sera of different mouse strains is currently underway and may allow identification of a viral antigen inducer if molecular mimicry is leading to the production of anti-CD13/APN antibodies.",

The association of CD13/APN autoantibodies with conditions favoring high in vivo titers is consistent with this mechanism. However, CD13/APN cannot credibly be described as a sequestered self-antigen in that it is normally expressed on the surface of numerous cell types throughout the body and is present in normal serum (Kawai et al., 2001). Therefore, neither of the general mechanisms thought to give rise to virus-induced autoantibodies seems likely in the case of MCMV-induced CD13/APN antibodies.",

CMV infection has also long been recognized as a serious complication of bone marrow and solid organ transplantation because of vascular sequelae (Borchers et al., 1999, Matthes-Martin et al., 1998). CMV viremia after bone marrow transplant is associated with a significant increase in chronic graft vs. host disease (cGVHD), which shares many features in common with the autoimmune disease scleroderma, and begins as an inflammation and destruction of small blood vessels (Pandey and LeRoy, 1998). CMV viremia after solid organ transplant results in exacerbation of transplant vascular sclerosis leading to chronic graft rejection (Borchers et al., 1999). The mechanism(s) by which CMV produces these negative outcomes is not understood, however, reduction of viral titers with anti-viral drugs decreases cGVHD, CMV-associated rejection, and vascular stenosis (Koskinen et al., 1999, Matthes-Martin et al., 1998). Autoantibodies targeting an angiogenic factor such as CD13/APN may be one mechanism by which CMV could mediate these effects. The two mouse strains found to produce anti-CD13/APN antibodies in this study are also the strains most susceptible to CMV-induced vascular disease (Berencsi et al., 1998, Hamamdzic et al., 2001, Presti et al., 1998). The fact that CMV induction of anti-CD13/APN antibodies is now reproduced in mice should make it possible to examine whether such antibodies play a part in CMV-induced vascular pathology.",
