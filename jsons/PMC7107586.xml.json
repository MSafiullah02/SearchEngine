Categorical variables were described with numbers and percent. Unpaired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare continuous quantitative variables, depending on the distribution. Non-parametric Fisher tests were used to compare qualitative variables. Due to multiple tests being performed a conservative two-sided significance level of P < 0.01 was chosen. Time series analysis of malaria cases (the most frequent diagnosis) was performed and multiplicative decomposition of monthly data was used to examine the trend, after removing seasonality and random error.",

Similar rates in terms of sex, median age, travel duration and predominance for tourism as the reason of travel are reported.6,7 However, our results are characterized by the predominance of travellers returning from Africa, in comparison to Asia in a previous global GeoSentinel study.4 This can be explained by the local demographics in Marseille, particularly related to the migrant African population. Marseille is historically associated with Comoros migrants, with a large Comoros-originated population estimated at 50 000\u201370 000 in early 2000s, although more recent figures are unknown.3 This results in differences of traveller characteristics in comparison to other GeoSentinel sites, notably higher rates of VFRs, more frequent hospitalizations and low levels of pre-travel consultations. We report a disproportionately high rate of hospitalizations in patients from sub-Saharan Africa and amongst VFRs. This highlights the need to target our travel health prevention messages towards VFRs, a sub-group with known barriers to accessing pre-travel health advice.8,9 The African migrant population in Marseille may have specific barriers to pre-travel consultations, including financial constraints for malaria prophylaxis and lack of information. Potential strategies include primary care physicians routinely questioning immigrant patients about future travel plans.8",

We confirm that P. falciparum malaria remains the most frequent cause of febrile illness in international travellers returning to Marseille, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. This is similar to both global studies4 and previous local studies in Marseille from 1999 to 2003.12 An overall decreasing trend in the number of monthly malaria cases can be noted from 2007 to 2015 (Figure 3). This is consistent with a global general decreasing trend since 2000.4 However, in our study, the sudden drop in 2011 is most likely due to a decrease in the numbers of cases acquired in the Comoros archipelago (Figure 3); decomposition of monthly non-Comoros malaria cases demonstrated a gradual decreasing trend in comparison to the sudden drop of cases in Comoros travellers from 2011. This is in line with local malaria surveillance data demonstrating a major decline in malaria morbidity and mortality in the Union of Comoros between 2010 and 2014, which is attributed to malaria prevention and control interventions.13 This is an example of a local single site analysis in Marseille providing accurate sentinel surveillance information for malaria epidemiology in Comoros. Alongside sentinel analysis for diagnosis, important information on rates of malarial drug resistance can also be collected from travellers.14",

Dengue was the second most common diagnosis during our study period, with 35% of patients from Asia, consistently with global data.4,7 Furthermore, we report a significant increase in chikungunya cases between the two periods. This high rate of imported arboviral diseases is likely to increase, given the trend of increasing numbers of unwell travellers returning from the Caribbean and South East Asia. This indicates the need for improved prevention strategies, both before travel, by reinforcing pre-travel advice toward prevention of insect bites and malaria chemoprophylaxis, and after, with improved epidemiological surveillance and healthcare professional training. Pre- and post-travel advice should also include advice on reducing respiratory transmission (such as local emergence of multi-resistant tuberculosis or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus), and improved hygiene practices to reduce nosocomial transmission of multi-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, improved diagnostic tools after travel, such as multiplex PCR, may help increase the number of etiological diagnoses amongst syndromic diarrhoeal and respiratory illnesses.",
