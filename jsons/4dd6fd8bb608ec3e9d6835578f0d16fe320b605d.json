            "text": "This paper provides a formal evaluation of the predictive performance of a model (and its various updates) developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) for predicting daily deaths attributed to COVID19 for each state in the United States. The IHME models have received extensive attention in social and mass media, and have influenced policy makers at the highest levels of the United States government. For effective policy making the accurate assessment of uncertainty, as well as accurate point predictions, are necessary because the risks inherent in a decision must be taken into account -especially in the present setting of a novel disease affecting millions of lives. To assess the accuracy of the IHME models, we examine both forecast accuracy using tools from the econometric literature, as well as the predictive performance of the 95% prediction intervals provided by the IHME models. We find that the initial IHME model underestimates the uncertainty surrounding the number of daily deaths substantially. Specifically, the true number of next day deaths fell outside the IHME prediction intervals as much as 70% of the time, in comparison to the expected value of 5%. In addition, we note that the performance of the initial model does not improve with shorter forecast horizons. Regarding the updated models, our analyses indicate that the later models do not show any improvement in the accuracy of the point estimate predictions. In fact, there is some evidence that this accuracy has actually decreased over the initial models. Moreover, when considering the updated models, while we observe a larger percentage of states having actual values lying inside the 95% prediction intervals (PI), our analysis suggests that this observation may be attributed to the widening of the PI's. The width of these intervals calls into question the usefulness of the predictions to drive policy making and resource allocation. * We thank the authors of the IHME model for making their predictions and data publicly available. We agree with the statement on their website http://www.healthdata.org/covid/updates: Having more timely, high-quality data is vital for all modeling endeavors, but its importance is dramatically higher when trying to quantify in real time how a new disease can affect lives. Without access to the data and predictions this analysis would not have been possible. We also thank Noam B. Tanner for bringing the Brooks reference to our attention. Corresponding Key Summary Points 1. The discrepancy between the predicted death and the actual death in the USA has serious implications for the USA government's future planning and provision of ventilators, PPE, and the staffing of medical professionals equipped to respond to this pandemic.",

We do not provide a critique of the assumptions made by the IHME model, nor do we suggest any possible modifications to the IHME approach. Moreover, our analysis should not be misconstrued as an investigation of mitigation measures such as social distancing. We do, however, strongly believe that it is critical to formally document the operating characteristics of the IHME model -to meet the needs of social and health planners, as well as a baseline of comparison for future models.",

We call the prediction for a day made on the previous day a \"1-step-ahead\" prediction.

The depth of the red/blue color denotes the number of actual death counts above/below the PI. A deep red signifies that the number of deaths in that state was substantially above the upper limit of the 95% PI, while a light red indicates that the number of deaths was marginally above the 95% PI upper limit. Similarly, a deep blue signifies that the number of deaths was substantially below the lower limit of the 95% PI, while a light blue indicates that the number of deaths was marginally below 95% PI lower limit. These figures show that for March 30 only 27% of states had an actual number of deaths lying in the 95% PI for the 1-step-ahead forecast. The corresponding percentages for March 31, April 1 and April 2, are 35%, 27% and 51%, respectively. Therefore the percentage of states with actual number of deaths lying outside this interval is 73%, 65%, 73% and 49% for March 30, March 31, April 1 and April 2, respectively.

For March 31 the reverse was true; only 16% of locations had actual death counts below the 95% PI lower limit while 49% had actual death counts above the 95% PI upper limit. This can be clearly seen from Figures 1a and 1b which are predominantly blue, and red, respectively. These figures are summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 also shows that the accuracy of predictions does not improve as the forecast horizon decreases, as one would expect. For March 31 and April 1 the forecast accuracy, as measured by the percentage of states whose actual death count lies within the 95% PI, decreases as the forecast horizon decreases. For March 31 the 2-step ahead prediction is better than the 1-step ahead prediction, while for April 1 the 3-step is better than the 2-step, which in turn is better than the 1-step. However, April 2 shows that accuracy slightly improves between the 3-step and the 2-step.",

This graph shows a very strong linear association between the predicted errors for the red locations (R 2 = 96%, n = 25).

The latter is preferable but much harder to achieve in practice. The former can potentially lead to prediction intervals that are too wide to be useful to drive the development of health, social, and economic policies.

This graph reproduces Figure 1 with two changes. First, instead of analyzing the discrepancy between actual daily deaths and the predicted daily deaths, we now analyze the discrepancy as a percent of the actual daily death count. This is done so that the discrepancy between observed and predicted counts is normalized across different states and on different days.

First, the updated models are systematically biased across all days; that is the later models over-predict the number of daily deaths for April 4, April 8, April 13 and April 17. This can be seen by the predominance of blue across the maps in Figure 4 . In contrast, the initial model produced predictions that were biased on any given day but the direction of the bias, that is whether the model over-or under-predicted the actual daily death counts, varied across days. The second feature is that the percentage discrepancy between actual deaths and predicted deaths, in addition to being biased, does not improve with the updated models. That is, the point estimates from the updated models are as inaccurate, sometimes more so, than those in the initial model.",

Note that under this logit transformation, LAPE is a normed metric which approaches one for very large percentage discrepancies (especially when the observed count is close to or equal to zero), while equaling 0.5 for those instances with perfectly accurate predictions. Working on the logit scale avoids the need for ad-hoc rules for discarding outliers. When both observed and predicted death counts are equal to zero, the LAPE is equal to 0.5. Figure 5 presents boxplots of these values for the dates March 30 to April 2, corresponding to predictions made with the initial model, as well as boxplots of the LAPE's for the dates April 4, April 8, April 13 and April 17, corresponding to predictions made with the updated models, where each row corresponds to 1-step through ",
