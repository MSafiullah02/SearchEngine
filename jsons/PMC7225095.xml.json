[1] evaluated the occurrence of venous and arterial thrombotic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and systemic arterial events in 184 patients with Covid-19 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). All patients received standard thromboprophylaxis (Nadroparin 2850 to 5700 IU per day based on body weight). The composite incidence of thrombotic events was 31%. Venous thromboembolic events were the most common (27%) and a majority were PEs. Independent predictors of thrombotic events were increased age and evidence on screening blood tests for a coagulopathy (prothrombin time [PT] > 3 s above the upper limit of normal [ULN]), activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT] > 5 s above the ULN; adjusted hazard ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.9\u20139.1). None of the patients experiencing thrombotic events met strict criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).",

Homotrimers of S proteins make up the spikes on the virus surface and enable binding to host receptors. Coronaviruses contain at least 6 open-read frames (ORFs) that encode primary structural proteins that include spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N). S proteins are responsible for attachment to host receptors. M proteins contain transmembrane domains that contribute to virus shape and binding to the nucleocapsid. The E protein is involved with virus assembly and pathogenesis. The N protein packages and encapsulates the genome into virions and also antagonizes silencing RNA (reviewed in Becker) [10].",

Microscopic findings on histology included: mild-to-moderate lymphatic infiltrates (predominately in the interstitial space), CD4+lymphocytes aggregated around small blood vessels that contained platelets and small thrombi, desquamated type-2 pneumatocytes within the alveolar spaces, small vesicles believed to represent viral inclusions, thickening of alveolar capillaries with fibrin thrombi, entrapped neutrophils and CD61+megakaryocytes (Fig. 1).

Pericytes play many important roles in vascular homeostasis, ranging from vascular repair to regulation of vascular tone; however, they play a particularly important role in states of inflammation where they cover gap junctions (reviewed in Sims [18]. Abnormalities within pericytes or degeneration cause tissue injury and metabolic changes that can also be detrimental to vital organs.",

First, being a primary portal for entry of pathogens the lungs have robust innate (non-specific) and adaptive (specific) immunity potential and reserve. Epithelial cells secrete mucins, defensins, lactoferrin and nitric oxide as an early defense. They also secrete IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and platelet activating factor to recruit inflammatory cells. Second, dendritic cells and macrophages line the respiratory tree where they present and phagocytose pathogens and also secrete chemokines, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. Third, lymphocytes are present throughout the airways and lung parenchyma. T cells provide cell-mediated immunity and \u03b2-cells are responsible for human immune responses by synthesizing antibodies. Forth, neutrophils are recruited rapidly to sites of infection or injury where they migrate from capillaries into alveolar and interstitial spaces. NETs, as previously described have platelet and contact protease activating potential, complex with histones that have cytotoxic effects and, in addition, produce DNA-myeloperoxidase complexes that can enter the circulation and exert proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects \u201cat a distance\u201d from the initial cluster [46]. Viral infections typically activate the innate immune system through toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize molecular patterns (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs) [73].
