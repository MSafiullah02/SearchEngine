A group from Hong Kong was the first to observe a cytopathic effect compatible with viral growth, 2\u20134 days after inoculating a lung biopsy specimen and a nasopharyngeal aspirate sample on fetal rhesus kidney cells (FRhK-4) [7]. The cytopathic effect consisted of cell rounding and detachment. A specific immune response to infected cells was observed in patients with typical SARS but not in healthy blood donors. Similar findings were confirmed by the two other groups using African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells 5, 6.",

The other group utilized degenerated primers to produce random RT-PCR products under low-stringency conditions for direct sequencing [5]. This group was the first to report to the network a phylogenetic analysis of one of the two polymerase gene fragments they found, already suggesting that the novel agent constituted an independent genetic group within the genus Coronavirus\n3, 5. After the genome fragments obtained in Europe and America had been exchanged through the WHO network, it was shown by amplification and sequencing of a continuous stretch of cDNA that all fragments were physically located on one viral genome [5]; the analyzed sequence bridged the communicated fragments, and the length of the product obtained (3 kb) was concordant with what would have been expected in a coronavirus genome. The sequence that had been obtained from the American isolate was found to be identical to the base in the European isolate. Because the European isolate was derived from Singapore and the American one from Hanoi, it was thus proven that the same virus was present in two geographically separated outbreaks of the same disease.",

This gene is present in most group 2 coronaviruses; a common ancestor is thought to have acquired it horizontally from influenza C virus 11, 12. Like group 1 coronaviruses, the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV, which in many group 2 coronaviruses is cleaved into two domains (S1 and S2), lacks the typical cleavage recognition site. In common with group 3 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV has one instead of two papain-like proteases encoded by open reading frame 1a [10]. Similar to avian infectious bronchitis virus (group 3), the 3\u2032-untranslated region of SARS-CoV contains a conserved sequence motif that is thought to have been acquired horizontally from astroviruses [11].",

The technical path to success was a rather conventional one. Because the agent could be cultured, a combination of classical methods (cell culture, electron microscopy, immunofluorescence) and basic molecular biology techniques (RT-PCR, random priming) has been sufficient for its identification. In other settings, where non-culturable agents were to be found, either more-sophisticated molecular techniques like subtractive amplification (representative difference analysis [13]) or more-complex combinations of classic and molecular methods have been necessary [14]. With the pathogen and its genome at hand, the necessary steps for diagnosing, treating and studying the pathogenesis of the disease can now be undertaken. The lesson learned from the identification of SARS-CoV is a general rather than a scientific one: in a situation of an impending epidemic, scientists are able to cooperate on a high level of proficiency in an efficient manner. The common trait of scientists to be competitive can be directed into a most productive direction by clever guidance, as demonstrated by the communicable disease surveillance and response team of the WHO.",
