So how useful is a test that will not detect all those who are affected? For example, if only the p.PheF508del mutation is sought, false negative results in couples from a population with a frequency for this mutation of 70% will be 0.51 (1\u2212(0.7\u00d70.7)) \u2013 i.e. approximately half the couples will not be identified by this approach. Detection of the less common mutations (some of which are only present at a 1\u20132% frequency in the population) would add to the workload, but would not substantially increase the information gained by the screening program. Additional problems that would need to be resolved before embarking on widespread cystic fibrosis screening include:1.Uncertainty about disease severity for some mutations. Thus, counseling in a number of instances will be difficult and incomplete, and2.Potential for racial profiling as cystic fibrosis is rarely found in some populations, for example Asian, and so detection rates in these will be minimal. Some would argue that one should not exclude or include particular ethnic groups in screening programs because this places undue emphasis on ethnicity and predisposition to genetic diseases. Others would say that disease and ethnic predisposition is a reality and, in the context of personalized healthcare, needs to be considered.\n",

Familial hypercholesterolemia is clinically important, as >50% of affected men will develop coronary artery disease by the age of 50, and >30% of women will do so by the age of 60 [10].

Therefore, DNA sequencing is needed and any changes found are not necessarily pathogenic in nature, but can be variants of unknown significance (Chapter 3). Mutations in other genes can also produce a similar clinical picture (phenotype). These include APOB, ARH and PCSK9 which interfere with the cholesterol pathway. Finally, environmental factors such as diet, smoking and hormones also impact on the cholesterol level.

In 2008 NICE (the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) published guidelines for a new approach to the treatment and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, which included personalized medicine through DNA testing of individuals and at-risk family members detected by cascade testing.

Another genetic link between sport and illness is autosomal dominant familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is caused by mutations in muscle sarcomere genes. This disorder may initially present as sudden cardiac death following strenuous physical activity. Although the molecular DNA defects underlying this disorder are known, their number and complexity make it impractical to screen professional sportsmen and women, unless there are reasons such as a family history, unexplained syncopal attacks, or cardiac findings during clinical examination. Generally, an individual with this type of inherited cardiomyopathy is warned against playing competitive sports as strenuous activity is associated with sudden cardiac death. Those with the disorder can have their heart rates monitored electronically, or have defibrillators implanted to instantly revert ventricular arrhythmias that arise.Box 6.1Genes and Sport.The APOE4 gene variant described earlier (Chapter 2) is associated with a greater risk of developing Alzheimer disease, and the risk appears to be further increased in boxers \u2013 presumably as a consequence of chronic brain trauma. In a recently reported study, 50% of individuals with chronic traumatic encephalopathy were shown to carry at least one APOE4 allele (one was homozygous for this marker) compared to the general population carrier rate of 15% [14]. Although considering only a small sample size, a 2006 report suggested that the APOE4 variant was also associated with poorer cognitive and behavioral outcomes following moderate and severe traumatic brain injury [14]. Should an individual who has the APOE4 marker (particularly someone who is homozygous for this marker) avoid boxing? Would an employer or trainer be at risk of litigation for not advising a boxer to have their APOE4 status determined? Should someone with this genetic marker be excluded from boxing? Hypothetical questions such as these continue to be asked, but there are no clear answers. If genetic testing is used for screening for susceptibility to work related conditions it should show:1.Strong evidence for linking the working environment and the disorder;2.The disorder has serious implications for the health or safety of employees;3.The test has the appropriate sensitivity, specificity and other parameters, and4.Privacy and the potential for inappropriate discrimination are addressed.\n",

Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 carcinogens, and damage results from chemical modification of purines by mutagens, inability of the DNA repair mechanisms to correct this damage and incorrect nucleotide incorporation opposite the distorted base during DNA replication [15]. NG DNA sequencing allows the DNA signatures of tissue damage and DNA repair to be cataloged.

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) develops an agreed taxonomy and nomenclature. It maintains an official index and publishes this information. In its 2009 release, the ICTV recognized six orders of viruses with another group yet to be placed into an order. There were 87 families, 19 subfamilies, 348 genera and 2 285 species confirming further the heterogeneity found in viruses. The building of an accurate taxonomic classification has many advantages, including new insights into the biology of the viruses and their evolutionary relatedness which provide important clues when dealing with new infections [18] (Box 6.2\n).Box 6.2Integrated DNA and RNA in the Genome.The genomes of vertebrates contain many copies of retroviral sequences acquired during evolution. These could function to protect the host from viral infection, and possibly as a source or natural reservoir for the virus to persist and transmit. However, it is now apparent that it is not only retroviruses that can integrate a copy of their RNA into the host\u2019s somatic and germline genome, which is the necessary first step before replication can occur. The genome of some bees has been shown to contain sequences from a positive (+) strand RNA Dicistroviridae that infects insects. These bees are resistant to infection by the virus. Following this observation, a comparative bioinformatics study of genomic sequences from 48 vertebrate species using sequence data from non-retroviruses containing single-stranded (ss) RNA genomes was undertaken. Surprisingly, it was shown that about half the vertebrates had integrated non-retrovirus sequences into their genomes. The next unexpected finding was that these integrations came mostly from two groups of RNA viruses from the negative (\u2212) strand RNA Mononegavirales order. These were either Ebola and Marburg viruses \u2013 Filoviridae family associated with lethal hemorrhagic fevers \u2013 or Bornavirus \u2013 Bornaviridae family are associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders which can be fatal. The vertebrates that had the integrations suggested these events had occurred over 40 million years ago. Therefore, the conservation of sequences coding for virus-like proteins is thought to have some selective advantage, possibly increasing the host\u2019s resistance to infection. Conversely, continued integration and persistence might provide viruses with a natural reservoir for future infections. An example would be bats, which are now thought to be natural reservoirs for the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Sequences from these viruses are detectable in some bats with some having open reading frames [19].",

Prusiner who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997 for his work on prions. The important components of prion disease include the PRNP gene and its cellular product PrPc (prion protein cellular) which can become the infectious protein product PrPSc (prion protein scrapie). The normal PrPc is a cell surface glycoprotein found in a wide range of animals, having a function that as yet remains unknown. PrPc needs to change its conformation to its isoform PrPSc to be infectious. No nucleic acid is involved in this process, highlighting the novel way in which prion disease arises and is propagated [28]. The disease leads to widespread neurodegeneration with cognitive and motor impairment. It is fatal and there is no treatment (Box 6.3\n). Work continues to develop an early diagnostic marker for this disease. This is a priority for screening blood and its products.\nBox 6.3Prion Disease.Prion disease may be sporadic, inherited, iatrogenic or transmissible from animal to human via infected meat and now human to human via blood products. The dementia that results includes sporadic, iatrogenic, inherited and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE in cattle (related to the 1986 epidemic of mad cow disease in the United Kingdom), and scrapie in sheep and goats. In 1996, the emergence of variant CJD (vCJD) in humans is thought to have arisen from transmission across the species of the BSE agent. vCJD is characterized by an early age of onset (Figure 6.3\n). Mutations in the PRNP gene account for the inherited forms of CJD. However, in the vast majority of sporadic cases, there are no detectable DNA mutations, and the change from PrPc to the abnormal PrPSc is thought to occur because of somatic mutations or other, as yet unknown genetic or environmental factors. Risk factors for developing vCJD include young age, residence in the United Kingdom especially between 1985 and 1990, and intriguingly, homozygosity for a codon 129 polymorphism in the PRNP gene. At this position there is either a methionine or a valine. In normal individuals, the combinations of methionine/methionine, methionine/valine and valine/valine are present. However, in patients with vCJD, the homozygous methionine is always found, suggesting that this may lead to genetic predisposition. Most patients developing iatrogenic CJD after receiving pituitary extracts for growth hormone are also homozygous for methionine. If this is correct, some have hypothesized that a second wave of vCJD will occur in the future involving those who are methionine/valine heterozygotes or homozygotes for the valine allele because a longer incubation period is needed to develop prion disease without the additional genetic risk factor. Other less well characterized polymorphisms in this gene have been detected and may represent additional genetic modifiers [28]. Prion disease remains a challenge for the future, particularly to explain how the infectious forms occur without any apparent conventional infectious agents being involved. Better diagnostics and some form of therapy are needed for this rare but fatal infection.",

This outbreak was described as swine flu, because it was a well-recognized cause of influenza in pigs. The virus is related to the H1N1 virus that caused the Spanish flu, and can spread from person to person. The WHO declared a swine flu pandemic in June 2009. Vaccines were rapidly developed and stockpiles of antiviral drugs, particularly the two mentioned in Table 6.5, were released to the public. Rapid NATs requiring RT-PCR because it is an RNA virus were developed (see Table 3.3). This flu was a little unusual because it tended to be more severe in younger people, including children and pregnant women whereas deaths from seasonal flu involve mostly the elderly. Despite early concerns expressed by public health officials and considerable media hype, the WHO declared the H1N1 pandemic over in August 2010.Box 6.4SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).This infection attracted a lot of publicity and provoked considerable fear when it emerged in China and then Hong Kong in 2003. SARS subsequently spread to many countries, producing around 700 deaths in the first half of 2003. This was at one time described as the first pandemic of the 21st century, but it never progressed beyond an epidemic because of effective public health measures effected by mid 2003 [36]. The social and economic impacts of this infection were considerable, including major disruptions to international travel. SARS was shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) which was thought to have crossed the species barrier, although the animal reservoir for SARS took a while to find. It is now thought to be:1.Masked palm civets \u2013 used for exotic food dishes in China, and2.Horseshoe bats [37].\nTraditional approaches such as viral culture, electron microscopy and serology helped to characterize the SARS virus. Nevertheless, SARS illustrated the value of NAT approaches in dealing with an emerging virus. Molecular testing enabled the following to be possible in a very short time frame:1.Typing of the virus from two different countries (Taiwan and Hong Kong) showed that human to human spread had occurred;2.Rapid whole genome sequencing of viral RNA enabled the development of PCR based diagnostic assays, and3.In searching for animal reservoirs, RT-PCR based techniques were used. These allowed SARS-CoV to be detected, as well as identifying genetic differences between the human and animal virus.\nThe outbreak ended just as quickly as it started. Only occasional cases were reported in early 2004, and none after the end of April that year. However, there remain many unanswered questions including the inconsistent human to human transmission which might have been due to super-spreaders.Another observation was the relatively large numbers of health workers who became infected. This became an issue when two of the nine persons infected in China in 2004 worked in a reference laboratory conducting research into the virus. A similar scenario was reported earlier in Singapore. The latter case was documented on RNA sequencing of the virus to be due to a contaminated laboratory culture that the scientist had been working with three days before showing signs of the infection. The WHO subsequently flagged the importance of laboratory containment when dealing with the SARS virus.",

With this, the threat of dengue in the North American continent has become real. Humans have populated rural areas to an increasing extent, as well as pursuing more outdoor recreational activities.

            "text": "Our current understanding of genes and obesity is still rudimentary, so medical or motivational interventions cannot be tested. At the genetic level, obesity can be considered in three groups:1.Monogenic, Mendelian defects, such as mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4R) leading to an autosomal dominant cause for obesity in up to 6% of individuals, particularly those with more severe forms and earlier ages of onset (Box 6.5\n);Box 6.5Genes and Obesity.Apart from the MC4R example given, other genes associated with obesity have a recessive mode of inheritance. They include mutations causing deficiency in leptin and its receptor (LEP, LEPR) which act via the hypothalamus to control appetite and energy expenditure. One report, concerning a child with congenital leptin deficiency, described how a sustained reduction in weight occurred following treatment with recombinant human leptin. Other genes in the leptin-melanocortin pathway are also implicated including POMC and PCSK1. A human gene FTO was shown to be implicated strongly with the BMI (body mass index) in a genome wide association study involving subjects with type II diabetes. This has been replicated in other studies and appears to be reflecting common SNP polymorphisms in intron 1, with the risk allele highly prevalent in the general population. European carriers who are homozygous for the risk allele weigh on average 3 kg more. Some clues to FTO gene function include:1.\nFto null mice are protected from obesity by increased energy expenditure;2.\nFTO expression in humans is highest in the brain, particularly the cerebral cortex, and3.Duplication of a chromosomal region containing FTO (and other genes) was associated with mild obesity and mental retardation in a case study.\nIt was reported recently that a reduction in brain volume in healthy elderly individuals was also associated with the same FTO allele for obesity. Perhaps this is not surprising since obesity is also a risk factor in cognitive decline and dementia. Very rare monogenic causes of obesity include mutations in genes associated with hypothalamic function such as SIM1, BDNF and NTRK2. These may lead to abnormalities in energy balance resulting in hyperphagia and a net positive energy intake [43], [44].2.Syndromal disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A, and3.Complex but common forms of obesity for which the traditional association or GWAS have been used to identify risk alleles [44].\n",

In obese humans and animals (mouse, rat and pig) the ratio of the two major bacterial divisions in the gut shows a predominance of Firmicutes over the Bacteroides. This is likely to be a primary rather than secondary effect, because when germ-free mice were fed the microbioata derived from lean or obese mice, the phenotype of the recipient mice moved towards that of the donor mouse \u2013 i.e. the obese or lean phenotype was transmissible via the microbiome. One mechanism for this observation may be that the obese microbiome can extract more energy from food [46].

This is important in view of the successful public health campaigns in reducing the risk of sun-related skin cancers. Interventions recommended include the generous application of sunscreens, avoidance of sun and the wearing of wide brimmed hats, particularly in children.

The regulatory environment for this will need some common pathways and specific ones when comparing different bacterial species.",
