Using a stochastic branching process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals robustly outperforms forward-only approaches across a wide range of scenarios. The addition of rapid smartphone-based exposure notification offers few benefits over conventional manual tracing alone unless uptake of the digital system is near-universal. However, as long as exposure events can be detected by nearly all smartphones, the combination of manual and digital with bidirectional tracing more than doubles the probability of controlling outbreaks across three epidemiological scenarios. Implementing combined bidirectional tracing may be critical to controlling COVID-19 without more costly interventions.",

Population surveys in Italy, Iceland, and China have reported intermediate values around 45% (9) (10) (11) . High rates of asymptomatic carriers might result in undetected transmission chains that could reduce the efficacy of forward-tracing. (a) Notifying people exposed to known cases (black) and isolating them (green) can prevent further transmission, but will miss asymptomatic and undiagnosed cases (gray) and descendants. (b) Bidirectional tracing seeks to also notify and test infectors, enabling the subsequent notification and isolation of asymptomatic and undiagnosed cases and their descendants. (c) Manual contact tracing requires individuals to share a list of the people they have encountered with health authorities, who try to contact each person. (d) Private digital exposure notification apps are being developed by universities and public health authorities with support from Apple and Google, who are incorporating Bluetooth exposure detection capabilities into iOS and Android. Each device will broadcast rotating pseudorandom number \"chirps\" via Bluetooth and record those emitted by nearby devices, with signal strength indicating proximity (12, 13) . (e) In most privacy-preserving designs, individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 would be given a key enabling them to \"opt-in\" by uploading the chirps they broadcast to a diagnosis server (14). All devices will check the server to learn whether any posted numbers match their local exposure log and alert the user of exposure over a threshold set by the health authority. Manual tracers would seek to identify contacts without smartphones.",

In the pessimistic scenario, no tracing strategy was sufficient in isolation, although all reduced Reff by varying amounts (Fig. S25 ). Both manual tracing and digital exposure notification alone failed to reliably control the epidemic in the median and pessimistic scenarios. Low uptake of the digital system largely precluded its utility, while combined bidirectional tracing with high digital uptake offered even odds of control in the median scenario and near certainty of control in the optimistic scenario. Relative to current manual tracing approaches, combined bidirectional tracing with high uptake more than doubled the probability of controlling the spread SARS-CoV-2 across all scenarios.",
