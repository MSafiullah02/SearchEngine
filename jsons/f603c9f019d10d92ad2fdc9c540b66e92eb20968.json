Alkylating agents cause DNA damage, leading to mutations and cell death; for this reason, they also play a central role in chemotherapy treatments. A class of enzymes known as AGTs (alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferases) protects the DNA from mutations caused by alkylating agents, in particular in the recognition and repair of alkylated guanines in O 6 -position. The peculiar irreversible self-alkylation reaction of these enzymes triggered numerous studies, especially on the human homologue, in order to identify effective inhibitors in the fight against cancer. In modern biotechnology, engineered variants of AGTs are developed to be used as protein tags for the attachment of chemical ligands. In the last decade, research on AGTs from (hyper)thermophilic sources proved useful as a model system to clarify numerous phenomena, also common for mesophilic enzymes. This review traces recent progress in this class of thermozymes, emphasizing their usefulness in basic research and their consequent advantages for in vivo and in vitro biotechnological applications.",

            "text": "Monofunctional alkylating agents, a class of mutagenic and carcinogenic agents present in the environment, induce DNA alkylation in several positions including guanine at O 6 (O 6 -MG; 6% of adducts formed), the N 7 of guanine (N 7 -MG; 70%), and the N 3 of adenine (N 3 -MA; 9%) [1] . Alkylation of guanine (O 6 -AG) is a cytotoxic lesion, although the specific mechanism of this cytotoxicity is not yet fully understood. It was proposed that the toxic effect occurs after DNA replication, because the O 6 -AG incorrectly base-pairs with thymine generating a transition from G:C to A:T [2] . The mutations caused by O 6 -MG that occur at the time of replication are recognized by the post-replication mismatch repair system with potential harmful implications for cell viability. Apart from conventional DNA repair pathways as Mismatch Excision Repair (MMR), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Base Excision Repair (BER), alkylated-DNA protein alkyl-transferases (called O 6 -alkyl-guanine-DNA-alkyl-transferase (AGT or OGT) or O 6 -methyl-guanine-DNA-alkyl-transferase (MGMT); EC: 2.1.1.63) perform the direct repair of alkylation damage in DNA [3, 4] . They represent the major factor in counteracting the effects of alkylating agents that form such adducts [4] . These are small enzymes (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) that are widely present in organisms of the three kingdoms (bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes) but apparently absent from plants, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Thermus thermophilus, and Deinococcus radiodurans. The reaction mechanism of AGTs is based on the recognition of the damaged nucleobase on DNA [5] , followed by a one-step SN 2 -like mechanism, in which the alkyl group of the damaged guanine is irreversibly transferred to a cysteine residue in its active site [5] [6] [7] [8] (Figure 1 , blue path). In the C-terminal domain, a helix-turn-helix motif (in light green, or in orange in the SNAP-tag) is responsible of the DNA-binding activity. The peculiar irreversible reaction mechanism of these enzymes plays a pivotal role in the physiological DNA repair (blue path), and it has important repercussions in cancer cell treatment (red path) and biotechnological applications (green path).

Consequently, hMGMT has emerged as a crucial factor in anticancer therapies [12] -an inverse relationship has been discovered between the presence of hMGMT and the sensitivity of cells to the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents, such as temozolomide (TMZ), in different types of cancer cells, including prostate, breast, colon, and lung cancer cells [13] .",

Hence, in order to counteract the action of hMGMT in chemotherapy regimens, a large number of studies aimed to the develop hMGMT inhibitors to be used in combination with alkylating agents. In view of this therapeutic relevance, much success has been obtained through the design of hMGMT pseudo-substrates, namely, the O 6 -benzylguanine (O 6 -BG) and the strong inactivator O 6 -[4-bromothenyl]-guanine (O 6 -BTG, Lomeguatrib) [13, 14] . These compounds mimic damaged guanine on DNA and react with the protein by the covalent transfer of the alkyl adduct to the active site cysteine residue, thus irreversibly inactivating the enzyme (Figure 1 , red path). Therapeutically, O 6 -BG is not toxic on its own, but renders cancer cells 2 to 14 times more sensitive to alkylating agents' effects. The oligonucleotides containing several O 6 -BG are potent inhibitors and represent a valid alternative to the use of free modified guanines, thereby improving the activity of the alkylating chemotherapy drug in the treatment of some tumours [15] [16] [17] .",

To achieve this, the protein of interest is expressed in a fusion with additional genetically encoded polypeptides, called tags, which mediate the labelling. The first example of an autofluorescent tag was the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) allowing the in vivo localization of fusion proteins in cellular and molecular biology [18, 19] . Among affinity tags, of particular importance are the poly(His)-tag, the chitin-binding protein, the maltose-binding protein [20] , the Strep-tag [21] , and the glutathione-S-transferase (GST-tag) [22] , which allow fast and specific purification of proteins of interest from their crude biological source using affinity techniques. Solubilization tags are especially useful to assist the proper folding of recombinant proteins expressed in chaperone-deficient species such as Escherichia coli, avoiding protein precipitation and the use of alternative expression protocols [23, 24] -these include thioredoxin [25] and poly(NANP).",

They started from the knowledge that hMGMT tolerates the presence of groups conjugated to the pseudo-substrate O 6 -BG (O 6 -BG derivatives)-the unusual covalent bond with the benzyl moiety can therefore be exploited for \"biotech\" purposes ( Figure 1 , green path). Thanks to its small size, the engineered hMGMT (SNAP-tag) can be fused with other proteins of interest. The expression of the fusion protein inside the cells followed by incubation with opportune fluorescent derivatives leads to in vivo labelling of fusion proteins with the probe, which can be used for localization studies [26] . The same principle has also been used for the immobilization of tagged fusion proteins in vitro [30] . This offers a delicate condition for fixing and disposing in a better orientation of a wide range of proteins/enzymes on a surface. The SNAP-tag technology was successfully applied to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for the covalent immobilization of proteins of interest [31] . Another interesting application of this protein-tag is the possibility to produce new antibody fragments (scFv-SNAP) to be employed in the SPR analysis [32] .",

            "text": "Despite the different primary structures (Figure 2a) , thermophilic enzymes show a typical AGT protein architecture, consisting of two domains [37] : a highly conserved C-terminal domain (CTD), surprisingly superimposable for all available AGT structures (Figure 2b) , and a N-terminal domain (NTD), which is very different among AGTs and whose function is not well understood (likely involved in regulation, cooperative binding, and stability [6, 38, 39] ). The CTD contains the DNA binding helix-turn-helix motif (HTH); the Asn hinge, which precedes the -V/IPCHRVV/I-amino acid sequence containing the conserved catalytic cysteine (except the Caenorhabditis elegans AGT-2 that has the -PCHPsequence [40, 41] ); and the active site loop, responsible for the substrate specificity. A comparative structural analysis performed on AGT proteins whose structures are in the Protein Data Bank revealed significant differences of the intrinsic structural features that have been considered to be relevant for thermostability, such as helix capping, intramolecular contacts (hydrogen bonds, ion-pairs), and solvent-accessible surface areas. Helix capping plays a central role in the stability of \u03b1-helices, due to lack of intra-helical hydrogen bonds in the first and last turn [42, 43] , and its effect results in an overall structural stabilization of protein folding [44] . By inspecting the crystal structure of SsOGT (PDB ID: 4ZYE), considered here as the thermophilic reference AGT protein, we verified that the five \u03b1-helices of the composing the protein tertiary structure are characterized by the presence of helix capping, this possibly increasing the thermal stability. In particular, the helix H1 at the NTD is stabilised by a peculiar double serine sequence (S40-S41) and a glutamic acid (E54) at its CTD, the latter is strictly conserved in all AGTs from thermophilic organisms (see Figure 2a) . The HTH motif, built on helices H3 and H4, is stabilized at the level of H3 by a highly conserved threonine residue (T89) as N-cap and a serine (S96), distinctive of SsOGT, as C-cap. Furthermore, helix H4 contains two serine-based capping among which the one placed at NTD (S100) is strictly conserved in all thermophilic AGTs and is followed by a proline (P101) that fits well in the first turn of the helix thanks to its own backbone conformation. Finally, the helix H5 is protected by glutamic acid capping that is present in all the AGTs from different species. Another feature contributing to thermal stability is the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). Indeed, the decrease of SASA and the increase of hydrophobic residues that are buried from the solvent have stabilizing principles for thermostable protein [45] . As described in Table 2 , SsOGT shows the smaller total SASA value, in line with its exceptional stability. On the contrary, OGT from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [38, 46] has a higher value due to the peculiar conformation of both the active site loop and the C-terminal tail that are exposed to the bulk solvent and are less heat stable (Table 2) .",

As expected for thermostable proteins [47] , SsOGT, as well as the proteins from Sulfurisphaera tokodaii and Pyrococcus kodakaraensis, shows a larger number of electrostatic contacts, characterized by higher bond-dissociation energy, with respect to hydrogen bonds for which we did not detect significant differences among the analysed structures, apart from MGMT of P. kodakaraensis (Pk-MGMT) [48] . Although the number of H-bonds is approximately similar across the AGTs from different organisms, there should be differences in the position-related role of such bonds, supporting overall stability of thermophilic variants. With reference to Pk-MGMT, Hashimoto and co-workers detected the same number of ion-pairs between the extremophilic protein and E. coli Ada-C [49] ; however, more intra-and inter-helix ion pairs were found in Pk-MGMT. Although the absence of a correlation between ion pairs' position and stabilization in Ada-C exists, the intra-helix ion pairs act in the secondary structure of Pk-MGMT, stabilizing helices, and the inter-helix ion pairs consolidate the inter-domain interactions, enhancing the stability of the tertiary structure packing.",

In order to protect its genome in these harsh conditions, S. solfataricus evolved several efficient protection and repair systems [33, 52] . S. solfataricus is highly sensitive to the alkylating agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), showing a transient growth arrest when treated with MMS concentrations in the range of > 0.25 mM to 0.7 mM [33, 52] . Interestingly, although the ogt RNA level increases after MMS treatment, the relative enzyme concentration decreases, suggesting its degradation in cells in response to the alkylating agent and, in general, to a cellular stress [52] . Under these treatment conditions, however, the protein level rises after few hours, and, in parallel, the growth of Saccharolobus starts again [52] , indicating a role of SsOGT in efficient DNA repair by alkylation damage.",

A very similar, but simpler and faster radioactive assay was used in another procedure with a 32 P-terminal labelled oligonucleotide containing a modified guanine in a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequence (as Mbo I). The AGT DNA repair activity thereby allowed the restriction enzyme to cut [54] . This procedure was also used by Ciaramella's group to identify for the first time the activity of SsOGT [52] .

Other AGTs' structures are also available in the Protein Data Bank site (Figure 2a) As shown in Figure 1 , all AGTs are inactivated after the reaction and degraded via proteasome, whereas in higher organisms, the degradation is preceded by protein ubiquitination [9] . It is a common view that the recognition of alkylated-AGTs is due by a conformational change; however, data on structure and properties of alkylated AGTs are limited because alkylation greatly destabilizes their folding [39] . The methylated-hMGMT and benzylated-hMGMT 3D structures were only obtained by flash-frozen crystals, showing that alkylation of the catalytic cysteine (C145) induces subtle conformational changes [6, 7, 65] . Consequently, these structures might not reflect the physiological conformation of the alkylated hMGMT [39] .",

However, being originated from hMGMT, the extension to extremophilic organisms and/or harsh reaction conditions is seriously limited. [39] ), or with SNAP Vista Green substrate (in green; [66] ). By following the same approach used for the hMGMT as Kai Johnsson [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , an engineered version of SsOGT was produced [52, 59] . This protein, called SsOGT-H 5 , contains five mutations in the helix-turn-helix domain, abolishing any DNA-binding activity [52] . In addition, a sixth mutation was made-in the active site loop, where serine residue was replaced by a glutamic acid at position 132 (S132E). This modification increased the catalytic activity of SsOGT [52, 59] , as it was observed in the engineered version of the hMGMT during the SNAP-tag development [26] . SsOGT-H 5 shows slightly lower heat stability in respect to the wild-type protein (Table 3) , whereas the resistance to other denaturing agents is maintained. Moreover, SsOGT-H 5 is characterised by a surprisingly high catalytic activity at lower temperatures, keeping the rate of reaction to the physiological ones (Table 3) [52, 59] . These characteristics make this mutant a potential alternative to SNAP-tag for in vivo and in vitro biotechnological applications. The stability against thermal denaturation allowed Miggiano and co-workers to obtain the structure of the protein after the reaction with the fluorescent substrate SNAP-Vista Green, revealing the peculiar destabilization of the active site loop after the alkylation of the active cysteine [66] .",

To assay the activity to SsOGT-H 5 , it was necessary to choose models in which the endogenous AGT activity is suppressed. Thermus thermophilus is an ogtspecies, showing only one agt homologue (TTHA1564), whose annotation corresponds to an alkyltransferase-like protein (ATL) [73] . ATLs are a class of proteins present in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes [74] , presenting aminoacidic motifs similar to those of AGTs' CTD, in which a tryptophan residue replaces the cysteine in the active site [75] .

One of the most widely used display strategies is the simultaneous heterologous expression of enzymes and their in vivo immobilisation on the external surface of Gram-negative bacteria cells, by the utilisation of the ice nucleation protein (INP) from Pseudomonas syringae [84, 85] . Most recently, the N-terminal domain of INP (INPN) was used to produce a novel anchoring and self-labelling protein tag (hereinafter ASL tag ). The ASL tag consists of two moieties, the INPN and the engineered and SsOGT-H 5 mutant ( Figure 5 ) [86] . The novel anchoring and self-labelling protein tag (ASL tag ) system. A protein of interest (POI) is genetically encoded with the tag, which in turn makes it anchored in the outer membrane and accessible for the covalent linkage to a desired chemical group (magenta sphere) by the activity of SsOGT-H 5 (adapted from [87] ).",

The significant reduction of the costs related to the purification and immobilization is added to the overcoming of problems related to the recovery of enzymes by simple filtration or centrifugation methods [88] . SsOGT-H 5 , in turn, gives the unique opportunity to label immobilized enzymes with any desired chemical groups (opportunely conjugated to the benzyl-guanine; in magenta in Figure 5 ) [27, 59] , dramatically expanding biotechnological applications of this new tool. Depending of the chemical group of choice, modulating the activity of enzymes fused with the ASL tag can be possible by introducing activator or inhibitor molecules ( Figure 5 ). The ASL tag system was successfully employed for the expression and immobilization of monomeric biocatalysts, such as the thermostable carbonic anhydrase from Saccharolobus solfataricus (SspCA), as well as the tetrameric Ss\u03b2gly, without affecting their folding and catalytic activity [86] . Moreover, SspCA fused to the ASL tag showed an increase in residual activity of up to 30 % for a period of 10 days at 70 \u2022 C [87] , representing a huge advantage in pushing beyond reactions in bioreactors and in the reutilization of biocatalysts.",

Like those of other thermophilic Archaea, its enzymes are extremely thermostable and can be used in various biotechnological applications. For example, DNA polymerase I, also known as PfuDNA polymerase, is one of the most famous and frequently used enzymes from P. furiosus because of its high activity, thermostability, and strong 3 -5 proof-reading activity [91] . The first demonstration of an OGT activity in P. furiosus was in 1998, when Margison and co-workers identified a protein of 22 kDa, whose catalytic activity was abolished by the O 6 -BG pseudo-substrate.",

From its primary structure, the relative polypeptide seems to be closely related to the MGMT from Pyrococcus kodakarensis KOD1 (Pk-MGMT) [48, 89, 92] . The extreme thermostability was confirmed by in vitro biochemical studies on the heterologous expressed and characterized OGT protein from P. furiosus PfuOGT. This enzyme was active on BG-fluorescent substrates, thus allowing the competitive assay with methylated dsDNA. However, the experiments were performed at 65 \u2022 C instead of the standard procedure at 50 \u2022 C, as described for SsOGT [39, 59, 60] , due to the strong thermophilicity of this enzyme. This behaviour was effectively confirmed by differential scan fluorimetry analysis where the temperature melting (T m ) of PfuOGT was found to be 80 \u2022 C, much higher than that of SsOGT (68 \u2022 C) [89] . It is worth noting that, in order to obtain a the sigmoidal melting curve for PfuOGT, a slower heating rate (10 min/ \u2022 C \u00d7 cycle) was set up, whereas the T m value measurement is usually performed at 1 min/ \u2022 C \u00d7 cycle [93] .",

The CTN1690 ORF shows a clear homology of the O 6 -alkylguanine-DNAalkyl-transferase. SDS-PAGE gel imaging analysis on lyophilized T. neapolitana cells incubated with the AGT fluorescent substrate showed a strong fluorescent signal with a molecular weight close to that of SsOGT. The observed molecular weight and, above all, the sensitivity to the O 6 -BG derivative, led to the cloning and heterologous expression of the Thermotoga neapolitana OGT protein (TnOGT) in E. coli [89] . This protein, like most AGTs, has a role in DNA repair, as confirmed by competitive fluorescent assay in the presence of methylated dsDNA. As shown in Figure 3 , the IC 50 value was similar to that obtained for SsOGT. Surprisingly, the enzyme from T. neapolitana exhibited a very high activity at low temperatures [89] , similar to that possessed by the mutant SsOGT-H 5 (Table 3 ) [52, 59] . Superimposition analysis between a TnOGT 3D model and the free form of SsOGT (ID PDB: 4ZYE) revealed in both structures the presence of a serine residue in the active site loop (S132 in SsOGT, see Figure 2a ), which was replaced in SsOGT-H 5 by a glutamic acid to improve its activity at lower temperatures. Interestingly, some residues are missing in TnOGT that play an important role in stabilizing SsOGT. In particular, the ionic interactions that play a crucial role in the stability of the Saccharolobus enzyme at high temperatures, such as the pair R133-D27 [39] and the K-48 network [60] , are largely replaced by hydrophobic residues in the Thermotoga homolog. Evidently, different residues and mechanisms of stabilization may contribute to its exceptional catalytic activity at moderate temperatures and the high thermal stability.",

Studies on thermophilic AGTs represent a unique opportunity for structural analysis and, in the case of the S. solfataricus protein, for the identification of conformational changes after the trans-alkylation reaction, which are detectable with mesophilic AGTs, as the alkylated form are rapidly destabilized [6] . These results could have a wide impact, especially in medical fields for the design of novel hMGMT inhibitors to be used in cancer therapy [102] . Furthermore, given their small size, thermophilic enzymes are very useful for studying general stabilization mechanisms at high temperatures (as for Pk-MGMT and SsOGT), which can then be applied to mesophilic enzymes. Searching for alternative SsOGT homologues was clearly useful, leading to the identification of AGTs that are more resistant to thermal denaturation (PfuOGT) or to enzymes with a higher reaction rate at all tested temperatures (TnOGT).",

On the other hand, by an irrational approach (random mutagenesis) it is also possible to enhance their catalytic activity [103] , or modify the substrate specificity of these enzymes, making them active on benzyl-cytosine (O 2 -BC) derivatives, such as that which happened for the production of the CLIP-tag [104] .",
