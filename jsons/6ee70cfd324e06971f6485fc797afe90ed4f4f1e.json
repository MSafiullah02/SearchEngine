[1] In China, as in most countries, a commitment to bold new policies made on paper does not necessarily translate quickly into real changes on the ground. The AIDS warriors in the scientific community looked for ways to maintain the momentum. They convened a 3-day symposium during the 1999 Xiangshan Science Conference, an influential annual gathering supported by the prestigious China Academy of Sciences. As virologist Yi Zeng recalled, the meeting definitely succeeded in waking the scientific community up to the challenges ahead: \"Three straight days of discussion and debate showed the seriousness of AIDS from a number of perspectives. The China Academy of Sciences took up the cause, delivering a series of policy recommendations to the State Council.\"",

On 3 April 2000, the State Council held a discussion on the prevention of AIDS and other STIs, and the Politburo met to discuss HIV in early 2001. For the first time, significant domestic funds were put on the table to address the epidemic. Not surprisingly, given the horrific outbreak of HIV among commercial plasma donors 5 years earlier, the lion's share of the money was earmarked to strengthen the safety of the national blood supply, but national funds were also made available for HIV prevention activities. While that was a very important step forward, the money was not nearly enough to cover the cost of implementing the \"China Plan of Action for Containment and Control of HIV/AIDS (2001-2005)\", issued by the State Council the same year.",

Former US President Bill Clinton told interviewers from the Public Broadcasting Service how he unwittingly forced the first public handshakes between Chinese leaders and an HIV-positive person in November 2003: I was at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and I gave my speech on AIDS. There were three deputy ministers of the relevant government departments with me at the head table. After I answered a couple of predictable questions, this young man -I later learned he was HIV positive and an activist by the name of Song [Pengfei] -stood up. And you could have been in America: He had, like, a spiky hairdo, and he asked me a really sassy question, and so I said, 'Come up here.' Just on instinct I said, 'Come up here,' because I knew it was being televised nationally. He came up on the stage, and I put my arm around him and hugged him and shook his hand, and I took him over and introduced him to the vice ministers. And the Chinese showed the whole thing on television. They showed this man, a real person, shaking hands with these government ministers. Within 10 days, the prime minister had 10 AIDS activists in his office. Then before you knew it, President Hu [Jintao] was out visiting hospitals of people who were HIV positive ... I knew that the picture could be powerful. [5] Such events perhaps also underscored in the minds of top Chinese leaders the power of symbolism in confronting HIV and in chipping away at the stigma encrusted around the epidemic. It was not enough, they realised, to support evidence-based HIV policies. They needed to support -and be seen to support -the hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens who were living with the disease. In late 2004, Chinese President Hu Jintao said he wanted to meet people with AIDS and asked his staff to arrange a visit to a Beijing hospital. This was a surprise; normally health staff have to lobby for months or years to catch the attention of top leaders, let alone to persuade them to talk to patients. But the President, quite of his own accord, was determined to meet people with HIV. The visit was arranged for the eve of World AIDS Day, which falls on 1 December. Shaking hands with patients on the AIDS wards, Hu promised to help them in every possible way. He made the pledge not just on his own behalf, he said, but on behalf of all of Chinese society.",

            "text": "Officials who were keen to do more about HIV in China were still in a bind. On the one hand, it was clear that prevention and care services couldn't happen on a large scale without more active leadership from the highest levels of government. On the other hand, it was very, very difficult to attract that leadership unless they could be more honest about the scale of the problem. As the plasma donor fiasco underlined, the default behaviour among Chinese officials faced with a public health crisis at the turn of the twenty-first century was denial. Epidemiologists in China's HIV programme were well aware of this. In the early years of the epidemic, even the official bulletin of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine's AIDS programme, which carried AIDS case reports and data from other types of HIV surveillance and research, was classified as a confidential internal document. It was no secret to anyone in China or abroad that statistics produced by government departments were not always accurate due to difficulties in data collection and other problems. This was especially true if they dealt with subjects that might reflect well on local officials (such as economic growth and job creation) or when they might reflect badly (such as uncontrolled outbreaks of infectious disease). The scientists became accustomed to arguing with their more politically minded colleagues in the bureaucracy, urging them to be realistic about the number of people infected with HIV or at risk. Ray Yip, an epidemiologist who headed the China programmes for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and later the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said this required considerable bravery, given bureaucratic cultures rooted in imperial times. \"The classic mandarin instinct is to shoot the messenger. If I take bad news to a minister, like AIDS is getting out of hand, they say you must not be doing your job, maybe we should find someone more competent\". According to Yip, this was one of the reasons that so little was done following the first investigations into the outbreak of HIV among plasma sellers; it accords with epidemiologist Xiwen Zheng's account, given in Chap. 2, of trying to communicate the results of research honestly. \"The scientists were saying we've got a house on fire here, we've got to put it out before the whole village burns down\", Yip noted. \"But the person who can sound the fire alarm, they don't want to pass that message on to the very top, to the people who can take action\".",

Though they were published by the highest administrative body in the land, these estimates were not widely publicised as officials continued to report the number of confirmed HIV cases and journalists continued quite wrongly to assume that this represented the government's official estimate of the total number of people living with HIV in China.

This allowed activist health officials to argue for the publication of data-based estimates of the total number of people living with HIV. This made more sense than ever after the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) published country-specific estimates for the first time in 2000. Using a curve-fitting model, UNAIDS staff in Geneva estimated that half a million Chinese people were living with HIV at the end of 1999. With that number already on public record, China's scientists argued, why not try and do a better job at home? They used a simple spreadsheet-based model that included estimates of the number of drug injectors, sex workers, clients, gay men, and former plasma donors, and then combined that information with estimates of the percentage of each of those groups infected with HIV. Using data for the end of 2000, the epidemiologists came up with the figure of 600,000 people living with HIV in China [6] .",

Several of the worst affected provinces, led by Yunnan, built up a strong HIV surveillance system in high-risk groups early in the epidemic. Yunnan was also one of the first areas to start systematic surveillance of risk behaviour.

Many also enthusiastically drew attention to a prediction that if more were not done to prevent the spread of HIV in China, ten million people could be infected by 2010.

Indeed, we are now witnessing the unfolding of an HIV/AIDS epidemic of proportions beyond belief... Some of the major factors that have contributed to the relatively slow response to AIDS in China comprise insufficient openness in confronting the epidemic, a lack of commitment and leadership at many levels of government, especially provincial and local levels, a lack of adequate resources, a crumbling public health care system, and severe stigma and discrimination against people infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. A potential HIV/AIDS disaster of unimaginable proportion now lies in wait to rattle the country, and it can be feared that in the near future, China might count more HIV infections than any other country in the world.",

Bernhard Schwartl\u00e4nder, a coeditor of this volume, headed the group responsible for HIV surveillance and estimation at UNAIDS headquarters in Geneva at the time. He had not known of the report before its publication, and while he thought the estimates it contained were entirely reasonable, he was surprised by the strength of the language. \"I remember thinking, oh my God, is that really necessary?\" Having supported China in developing its surveillance and estimation systems in the past, he was also acutely aware of the different attitudes to statistics. The team in Geneva had been working for some time to develop methods that would allow them to report ranges which would more reliably reflect the uncertainty of estimates that were inevitably based on limited data points. \"In a country the size of China, and for a disease like HIV which is mostly invisible and so hard to measure, the difference between 800,000 and 1.5 million is nothing\", Schwartl\u00e4nder said. \"What's important is not the exact number, it's what you are doing about it\". But politicians are less comfortable than scientists are with uncertainty. \"Especially when there are goals and targets involved, Chinese leaders always want a single number\", Schwartl\u00e4nder said. If 1.5 million Chinese citizens were infected with HIV by 2001, then the country couldn't possibly meet the target, laid out in the 1998 longterm plan, of curbing total infections at 1.5 million by the end of 2010. If the true number was closer to the lower end of the range, meeting that target was still possible. \"We think of it as reasonable uncertainty. But for a lot of people whose jobs depend on it, the difference between 800,000 and 1.5 million is very concrete\".",

As the magnitude of the blood-related epidemic in central China began to sink in, more and more voices were also calling for care and treatment to be provided. \"There was clearly a feeling that the plasma seller outbreak was the government's fault\", said one health official, \"that we were at least indirectly responsible for those thousands of infections\". Into this flammable mix, a spark was thrown: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS is an airborne viral infection that seems to have spread from domestic animals to humans in southern China. The first apparent case was reported to Chinese health authorities in November 2002, but China did not share the information with the World Health Organization until February 2003. During those months of silence, the virus began spreading to other countries. By the time the WHO declared the global outbreak controlled in July 2003, close to 8300 people had been infected (5300 of them in mainland China, with another 2100 in Hong Kong and Taiwan) and 755 had died.",

At a meeting called by Wu to discuss SARS in 2003, one of the country's senior virologists, Yi Zeng, had underlined that SARS was relatively easy to control compared to the socially, culturally and politically more complex challenge presented by HIV. Scientists who were at the meeting remember the Vice Premier being struck by the information. Once SARS had been adequately dealt with, she promised, China would take on that more complex challenge.

In September 2003, speaking in front of the United Nations General Assembly's special session on HIV/AIDS, Executive Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang, on behalf of Premier Wen Jiabao, made an extraordinary commitment: the Chinese government promised to provide free antiretroviral treatment for all rural AIDS patients, as well as for poorer patients in China's cities. HIV testing would be made universally available for free to all Chinese citizens via the local CDC or other approved facilities, and all HIV-positive pregnant women would get free antiretroviral drugs and free infant formula milk they needed to reduce transmission of the virus to their babies.

While Gao Qiang lobbied colleagues in other departments to raise domestic spending on health, Gao Qiang also encouraged the judicious use of funds available from other sources. In its earliest incarnation, the Four Frees and One Care programme was underwritten by a grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The first grant, of US$90 million, was used largely to provide HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment to people in the seven central provinces of China most affected by the outbreak related to blood selling. Funding for HIV prevention and care from domestic coffers rose quickly (the details can be seen in Fig. 10 .8 of the Chap. 10). Until 2000 it languished under US$2 million a year. In 2001, with the first 5-year plan, that amount rose sevenfold. In 2003 it more than tripled again to almost US$50 million. By 2004, the year when China's leadership really put its weight behind HIV prevention and care, government spending had hit over US$100 million [12] .",
