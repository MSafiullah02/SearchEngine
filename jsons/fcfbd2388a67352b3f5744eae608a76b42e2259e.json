The disease appeared in China in December 2019, and it spread fast around the world, specially in european countries like Italy and Spain. The first reported case in Brazil was recorded in February 26, and after that the number of cases growed fast. In order to slow down the initial grow of the disease through the country, confirmed positive cases were isolated to not transmit the disease. To better understand the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil, we apply a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model to the analysis of data from the Brazilian Department of Health. Based on analyical and numerical results, as well on the data, the basic reproduction number is estimated to R 0 = 5.25. In addition, we estimate that the ratio unidentified infectious individuals and confirmed cases is about 10, in agreement with previous studies. We also estimated the epidemic doubling time to be 2.72 days.",

Several efforts were done since 70's in order to understand the mathematical evolution and spreading of diseases [1, 2] . convenient because it models the fact that many governments (including the Brazilian one) are forcing individuals tested positive (confirmed cases) to self-isolate from the community, and also because it distinguishes between the infectious people who do self-isolate, and/or those who do not (mostly likely because they have not developed the symptoms of the disease and are not aware of actually being infectious). Thus, the SIQR model may be described by the following rate equations:",

The time in our graphics were counted after the first confirmed case in Brazil, i.e., Day 1 was February 26 ,2020. The number of confirmed cases kept almost constant for some days, and start to grow faster since day 9 (March 5, 2020), where 8 cases were confirmed. In this case, we take the number of initial cases as I 0 = 8 for the model's purposes. Thus, from (\u03b1+\u03b7) I 0 = 0.428 we obtained (\u03b1+\u03b7) = 0.06. Considering this result, from \u03b2\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b7) = 0.255 we obtained \u03b2 = 0.315. As discussed in [8], the parameter \u03b7 is related to the time until patients are tested positive and isolated, but also to the fraction of all infectious individuals that are tested positive. These are mostly symptomatic patients, which we assume are isolated soon after the incubation time is over and first symptoms appear. The incubation time means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around \u2248 5 days [28]. Letting \u03b4 denote the fraction of infectious individuals entering Q, we obtain \u03b7 = \u03b4 x 0.2.",
