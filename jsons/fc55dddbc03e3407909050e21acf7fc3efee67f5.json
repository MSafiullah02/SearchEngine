In this study, we report the detection and characterization of bovine and water buffalo AstV strains identified in young bovine and buffalo calves with enteritis in Italy between 2012 and 2015. By negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, AstV-like particles were identified in the stools of the animals and AstV RNA was confirmed molecularly. The sequence (~3.2-kb) at the 3\u2032 end of the genome was determined for two bovine and two buffalo AstVs. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis on the partial ORF1b and full-length ORF2 revealed a marked genetic diversity although the viruses were distantly related to other AstV identified from ruminants. Gathering sequence information on ruminant AstVs is important to understand the extent of inter-species circulation and for the development of reliable, specific diagnostic tools.",

The family Astroviridae has been classified by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 1 into two genera, namely Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus known to infect mammalian and avian species, respectively. The genome length is 6.8 to 7.9 kb and includes a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), followed by three open reading frames (ORFs) namely ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2, a 3' UTR and a poly-A tail. There is a frame shift between ORF1a and ORF1b. ORF1a and ORF1b encode nonstructural proteins, a serine protease, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 is expressed from a subgenomic RNA and encodes the viral capsid protein (Mendez and Arias, 2007) .",

The bovine AstV strain UK was initially considered to be avirulent, as experimental infection of two gnotobiotic calves with AstV-like virus did not cause diarrhea (Woode and Bridger, 1978) . In 1984, two bovine AstV isolates from the USA, US1 and US2, antigenically related to the isolate obtained in England (UK), were shown to cause infection and cytopathology of M cells of the dome epithelium covering the Peyer's patches of the calf ileum (Woode et al., 1985) . In addition, co-infection with other enteric pathogens, such as bovine rotavirus (RV) and bovine torovirus, was shown to increase the severity of AstV infection (Woode et al., 1984) . Antigenic differences have been observed among bovine AstV strains, suggesting that multiple serotypes of bovine AstV may exist in nature (Woode et al., 1985) .",

            "text": "Even though bovine AstV was one of the earliest mammalian AstV to be discovered and studied in detail, no further research has been performed on this candidate bovine enteric pathogen over the past three decades. The genomic sequence of bovine AstVs was determined only in 2011 (Tse et al., 2011) . Recently, bovine and ovine AstVs have been associated with T encephalitis in cattle and sheep (Li et al., 2013; Bouzalas et al., 2014; Schlottau et al., 2016; Boujon et al., 2017 Boujon et al., , 2019 Pfaff et al., 2017; Seuberlich et al., 2016) , noting similar findings observed in humans (Quan et al., 2010; Vu et al., 2016) and in minks (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2010) . Altogether, these findings suggest that these enteric viruses may acquire neurotropism, although the mechanisms of this change in tissue tropism are not yet known (Selimovic-Hamza et al., 2017) . In spite of the new perspectives and accumulating evidence on the biological plasticity of AstVs, there is still limited information on the epidemiology and genetic diversity of these viruses in ruminants (Tse et al., 2011; Oem and An, 2014; Alfred et al., 2015; Sharp et al., 2015) , thus hindering to depict a complete portrait of their impact on large ruminants in terms of health and production. This gap may be an obstacle to the development of effective, specific diagnostic tools and unnecessarily delay the development/adoption of measures of prophylaxis. In this study, we report the characterization of bovine and buffalo AstV strains identified from different enteritis outbreaks occurred in Italy in 2012, 2013 and 2015.",

In subsequent studies, AstVs were found to elicit histological lesions in the first part of the intestine in experimental infections (Woode et al., 1985) . However, sequence data and diagnostic systems were not available until recently, thus hampering a diagnosis of AstV infection in most laboratories. Likewise, in this study the identification of AstVs was achieved by observation in TEM, even if a specific hyperimmune serum was not used to increase the sensitivity of the assay, as immunological reagents are not available for these viruses. The development of consensus primer sets for AstVs (Chu et al., 2008) finally provided researchers with a new tool for identification of diverse strains of AstVs from different animal species.",

The identification of animal-like AstVs in humans (De Benedictis et al., 2011; Janowski et al., 2019) and of neurotropic strains in humans and several animal species (Reuter et al., 2018) has markedly propelled the research on AstV. A 2011 revision of the ICTV classification (2009) recognized that classification based on genetic criteria is more appropriate. Based on phylogenetic analysis of MAstVs inferred on the aa sequence of the full length ORF2, 19 groups or species were proposed and the mean aa genetic distances (p-dist) range was calculated as 0.378-0.750, and as 0.006-0.312 between and within groups, respectively 1 . It is likely that with the accumulation of AstVs genome sequences, the criteria for species demarcation will be modified. Based on the aforementioned criteria, the four strains reported in this study, for instance, could represent each a candidate new species.",
