PARP\u20101, the founding member of the PARP family, is a molecular sensor of DNA breaks, playing a key role in the spatial and temporal organization of break repair through the local synthesis of poly(ADP\u2010ribose) (PAR) at damaged sites. In addition to its critical involvement in cellular response to DNA damage, poly(ADP\u2010ribosyl)ation has been ascribed to regulate various biological processes such as transcription, mitotic segregation, telomere homeostasis, cell proliferation, transformation, and cell death (Schreiber et al.,2006). The diversity of PAR functions is a consequence of the variety of the functional domains combined to the PARP domain in each PARP family member.",

A macro domain is present within the histone variant macroH2A that is associated to transcriptional repression and X chromosome inactivation (Angelov et al.,2003). Interestingly, this domain is able to negatively regulate PARP\u20101 activity on particular promoters that must remain inactive in the absence of appropriated stimulation or on the inactive X chromosome (Ouararhni et al.,2006; Nusinow et al.,2007). Macro domains were recently shown to bind ADP\u2010ribose and its derivatives (Karras et al.,2005). Those of PARP\u20109 and of some RNA virus encoding nonstructural proteins (from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus SARS\u2010CoV, the hepatitis E virus, and the Semliki Forest virus) are indeed able to bind poly(ADP\u2010ribose) (Karras et al.,2005; Egloff et al.,2006).",

PARP\u20109/BAL1 overexpression stimulates cell migration in vitro, suggesting a role for PARP\u20109/BAL1 in the promotion of malignant B cell migration and dissemination in high risk DLBCL (Aguiar et al.,2000). Murine Parp\u201014, also named Coast6, was described as a cofactor of Stat6 in a pathway activated by interleukin 4 (IL\u20104; Goenka and Boothby,2006). Its coactivating property requires functional PARP activity (Goenka et al.,2007). PARP\u20109/BAL1 is also likely a transcription coactivator, its overexpression in B lymphocytes, stimulated by interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), inducing the transcription of IFN\u03b3\u2010controlled genes (Juszczynski et al.,2006).",

DELTEX proteins participate in Notch signaling pathway that controls cell fate determination, notably in myogenesis, neurogenesis, lymphogenesis, and intestinal homeostasis (Artavanis\u2010Tsakonas et al.,1999).

This region is syntenically conserved in mouse chromosome region 16B3, with the exception of the PARP\u201015 gene, which is absent in mouse (and species other than primates, Schreiber et al.,2006). Moreover, PARP\u20109/BAL1 and BBAP genes are located head\u2010to\u2010head, their mRNAs are antisense through their 5\u2032 extremities, and both genes are controlled by a IFN\u03b3\u2010responsive bidirectional promoter (Juszczynski et al.,2006).

As expected, control sense probes for each gene only showed background labeling (Fig. 1C and data not shown), whereas antisense probes yielded specific labeling patterns. At the earliest time point examined, embryonic day (E) 10.5, as expected Parp\u20101 was expressed at high levels throughout the embryo (Fig. 1A). Parp\u20109 showed a differential expression pattern, with transcripts detected in the neuroepithelium of the brain, particularly in the telencephalic vesicles (Fig. 1B). Parp\u20109 transcripts were also detected in the embryonic gut, notably at the level of the cloaca (Fig. 1B). No expression of Parp\u201014 was detected at this stage of development (data not shown). At E12.5, Parp\u20109 was regionally expressed in the forebrain, namely in the telencephalic vesicles and hypothalamus, and in the epithelium of the nasal cavity (Fig. 3B). Additionally, transcripts were detected in the developing intestine, notably in the midgut loops, and the urogenital sinus (Fig. 4B).",

Expression of Parp\u20109, Parp\u201014, and Parp\u20101 was rather homogenous throughout the thymus from E14.5 to E17.5 (Figs. 1D\u2013H, 2A\u2013C and data not shown). At E18.5 (Fig. 2D\u2013F), whereas Parp\u20101 expression was restricted to the cortex of the thymus, where immature lymphocytes proliferate, Parp\u20109 and Parp\u201014 displayed higher expression in the cortex but also significant expression in the medulla. We then analyzed postnatal expression in thymus from 12\u2010week\u2010old mice (Fig. 2G\u2013I). Parp\u20101 gene expression was particularly high in the subcapsular zone and the mature cortex, which contains double\u2010positive (CD4+/CD8+) cells, whereas Parp\u20109 and Parp\u201014 expression was higher in the medulla. Therefore, whereas Parp\u20101 expression seems to be related to T\u2010cell proliferation, macroParps expression is more likely related to T\u2010cell selection or maturation. Differential expression was also seen in the adult spleen (Fig. 2J\u2013L), with a moderate expression of the three genes in the marginal zone and the white pulp. In addition, we found that Peyer's patches and lymphoid follicles, which are secondary lymphoid organs located in the intestine and colon wall, respectively, also moderately express the three genes (Fig. 2M\u2013O). Of interest, only Parp\u20101 is highly expressed in the germinal centers of Peyer's patches and colon lymphoid follicles (Fig. 2M), which correspond to sites of B\u2010cell selection and proliferation after antigen stimuli.",

At E12.5 and E14.5, Parp\u20109 transcripts were observed in the urogenital sinus, both in the epithelium and mesenchyme at the base of the bladder and the genital tubercule (Fig. 1E). This finding suggests a specific function of Parp\u20109 in the early development of urogenital regions. From E14.5 to E18.5, expression of Parp\u20109 was detected in the duodenum, midgut loops, and rectum (Fig. 1E, 4B,E). No expression was detected in more anterior foregut derivatives (esophagus, stomach). Interestingly, at late developmental stages from E16.5 to E18.5, a clear difference between Parp\u20101 and Parp\u20109 transcript distributions was observed. The level of Parp\u20101 transcripts was highest in undifferentiated cells at the bottom of the intestinal crypts, in intestine and colon (Fig. 4D). On the opposite, Parp\u20109 expression was detected throughout the entire villi (Fig. 4E). This differential expression pattern was maintained in adulthood. Parp\u20101 expression was detected in the crypts of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon (Fig. 4F,H, and data not shown). In the colon, expression was extending to the bottom of the crypts, but progressively decreased toward the lumen (Fig. 4H). Parp\u20109 was expressed in the enterocytes of the entire epithelium of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon (Fig. 4G,I, and data not shown). In duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, Parp\u20109 expression was slightly higher from the bottom of the crypt to the crypt\u2010villus junction, and gradually decreased toward more differentiated cells along the axis of the villi (Fig. 4G and data not shown). In the colon, expression was homogenous throughout the epithelia, from the crypts to the lumen. The presence of Parp\u20101 in the proliferating cells of the intestinal crypts could be justified by the necessity for the maintenance of genome integrity in intestinal stem cells and progenitors. The presence of Parp\u20109 in the enterocytes of the entire villi suggests on the other hand that Parp\u20109 could be involved in differentiation or migration of the enterocytes, or in their absorptive function. Its expression at embryonic day 12.5, before villi formation (Crosnier et al.,2006), strongly suggests that it could be involved in morphogenesis of the intestine.",

These specialized epithelial cells possess an immune program, rather than the digestive program typical of the adjacent enterocytes of the villi (Hase et al.,2005). Of interest, Parp\u201014 transcripts were detected in the FAE (Fig. 2O), while barely detectable in the other parts of the gut (data not shown). Parp\u20101 expression was not differential between FAE and other regions of the intestinal epithelium (Fig. 2M). The FAE might be immunologically activated by the immune cells from the lymphoid follicles (Hase et al.,2005). This finding could explain why Parp\u20109 and Parp\u201014 expression is increased in this epithelium, assuming that both genes could be up\u2010regulated by immunological signals, as described at least for the Parp\u20109 gene that responds to IFN\u03b3 (Juszczynski et al.,2006).",

The genes encoding BBAP and PARP\u20109 are located head\u2010to\u2010head and controlled by a bidirectional promoter (Juszczynski et al.,2006). Both genes respond to IFN\u03b3 stimulation and are overexpressed in high risk DLBCL associating a prominent immune/inflammatory response (Juszczynski et al.,2006). This genomic organization of PARP\u20109 and BBAP genes is conserved in mouse, with Parp\u20109 and Bbap mRNAs being antisense through their respective first exons.

However, a difference was noticed in the relative level of Parp\u20109 and Bbap expression between the developing brain and gut at the stages examined, from E10.5 to E14.5: Parp\u20109 transcripts were more abundant in the gut than in the forebrain, contrasting with the distribution of Bbap transcripts, more abundant in the brain than in the gut (compare Fig. 5A and B with Fig. 1B and E, respectively).

            "text": "In summary, we have shown that the macroPARPs Parp\u20109 and Parp\u201014 display distinct expression profiles during mouse development and in adult tissues. Parp\u20109 is developmentally regulated, prominently expressed in the thymus, in specific regions of the central nervous system and of the gut. This regionalized expression pattern during mouse organogenesis suggests that Parp\u20109 could have a function in lymphogenesis, neurogenesis, and development of the intestine. In the adult mouse, the highest levels of Parp\u20109 transcripts were found in the medulla of the thymus, suggesting a role for Parp\u20109 in thymocytes maturation. Parp\u201014 also likely plays a role during thymic development and function, because this organ is the major site of Parp\u201014 expression, although at low levels. Interestingly, human PARP\u20109/BAL1 and mouse Parp\u201014/Coast6 were reported to act in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression activated by IFN\u03b3 and IL\u20104, respectively (Goenka and Boothby,2006; Juszczynski et al.,2006). These two cytokines can antagonize each other's function in thymocytes maturation and macrophage activation during the immune response (Ohmori and Hamilton,1997), raising the hypothesis of a possible antagonistic function for Parp\u20109 and Parp\u201014 in the immune response. Parp\u20109 was also expressed at higher levels in the enterocytes of the intestine, suggesting specific function(s) that could be related to homeostasis, nutrient digestion, and absorption, or to the barrier and defense function against toxic compounds or pathogenic microorganisms. Finally, we have shown that Bbap, the gene sharing a common promoter with Parp\u20109, is coexpressed with Parp\u20109 during mouse development and in mouse adulthood, suggesting that Bbap and Parp\u20109 share a common regulation. However, some additional tissue\u2010specific gene regulation may exist, with Parp\u20109 being expressed at higher levels in the developing gut than in brain, and with the opposite for Bbap. Therefore, Bbap and Parp\u20109 display both common and independent tissue\u2010specific regulations.",
