The Hot Spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis identifies areas with significantly high and low numbers of a domain given a geospatial mean. Similar to the approach undertaken by Lakhani et al.10, areas which met the criteria of being significant (at the p<.05 level) during all three analyses were identified as priority areas. After, a centroid (a marker representing the centre of an area) was produced for each priority area, and the travel time via motor vehicle from priority areas to the nearest palliative medicine and hospital service was clarified via two iterations of the origin destination cost matrix geoprocessing tool. Finally, the travel time was averaged.",

Three of these priorities are particularly suitable given the necessity of isolation: (i) improving psychosocial support for patients and families, (ii) providing resources to support home death and (iii) the development and use of a mobile specialist consultant team. Amending service provision with a focus on these priorities can support the delivery of services to vulnerable people within areas with poor access during COVID-19.

This is especially so in regions with poor access to health care \u2013 once again, for example rural regions12 - , and where health systems are over-burdened during a time of pandemic crisis.4 In this regard, telehealth programs which build the skills of family caregivers become paramount. 4 Dionne-Odom et al. 12 describe a telehealth Program to Support Family Members of Individuals with Cancer (herafter the Program). The Program involves six one hour weekly telehealth sessions for family caregivers to support their provision of palliative care for a family member. In the context of COVID-19 such an approach could be amended so that these sessions are offered at a higher frequency (for example, daily) and that information surrounding managing relevant COVID-19 symptoms, and addressing psychological complications for family members and patients are delivered. Furthermore, including the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) with an expertise in palliative medicine for ageing people with disability within telehealth sessions would be of benefit. Information sharing around how to manage the distinct consequences of COVID-19 for ageing people with disability can ensure a tailored approach where those who may not be able to receive inpatient health services due to service proximity and capacity issues, are still able to receive adequate support via informed family members.",
