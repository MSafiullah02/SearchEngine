This gene plays an important role in the growth and anti-aging mechanisms of the body. Reimers analysis revealed that there was a special structure (UPF005) at the C-terminus that is unique to the BAX inhibitor (BI)-1 superfamily [2]. Therefore, the GHITM gene was classified as a member of the BI-1 superfamily. Other members of this superfamily, responsive to centrifugal force and shear stress gene 1, Golgi anti-apoptotic protein and Lifeguard, all play roles in the growth and development of the body and inhibit apoptosis [3\u20136]. We speculate that GHITM also has similar functions, but the specific effects need further research and certification.",

            "text": "The golden apple snail (its body size traits were shown in Fig. 1.) originated in South America and was introduced into Asia as food in the 1980s [7, 8]. It has been listed as an invasive species owing to its characteristics of feeding on a variety of crops and rapidly reproducing. It also has a low economic value [9, 10] and serious damage to the development of the rice planting industry. In addition to the lack of natural enemies, its strong adaptability to temperature [11\u201315], food [16, 17] and wet environments [18], as well as its strong ability to grow and reproduce have been keys to its invasiveness. Studies of other species have shown that the GHITM gene functions in regulating the growth of the body and in cell apoptosis. Therefore, improving our knowledge of the GHITM gene of the golden apple snail may elucidate the mechanisms behind the golden apple snail\u2019s strong adaptability and rapid growth and reproduction. In addition, golden apple snails are rich in fat and protein [19]; therefore, studying genes related to their growth may help increase their protein levels, making them feed for some economically important fish [20, 21]. The GHITM gene was first discovered in the brown fat of mice [1], and then was studied in Crassostrea gigas [22], Anthocidaris crassispina [23], Bombyx mori [24], Actiniaria, Pinctada martensii and Apostichopus japonicus [25]. To date, no studies on the GHITM gene in Pomacea canaliculata have been published.\n",

The release of pro-apoptotic proteins in mitochondria activate downstream caspase proteins and leads to apoptosis [33]. Caspase-3 belongs to the CED (Caenorhabditis elegans death gene)-3 subfamily of the Caspase family [34]. In a normal state, caspase-3 exists in the cytoplasm in the form of zymogen with no activity. However, caspase-3 was activated when apoptosis occurs. We reduced the expression of the GHITM gene in the experimental group by RNAi technology, and then tested the activity of caspase-3 in the control group and the experimental group. The activity level of caspase-3 in the two experimental groups were significantly higher than that in the control group, indicating that apoptosis of the two experimental groups was severe. Therefore, it was speculated that the GHITM gene was involved in inhibiting apoptosis in golden apple snails. GHITM was reported to be a mitochondrial protein that functions to maintain cristae organization [33, 35]. We presumed that down-regulation of the GHITM gene leads to mitochondrial rupture, which leads to the release of apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c, Smac (Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase), and Htra2 (HtrA serine peptidase 2) [36], and ultimately induces apoptosis and activates Caspse-3 (Fig. 12).\n",
