Infectious 59 disease surveillance serves a crucial role for detecting and gathering information on zoonotic 60 pathogens: data obtained through surveillance are often the primary resource available for 61 informing public health management decisions [10]. Developing methods that improve our 62 ability to infer information about a pathogen's transmission dynamics from available 63 surveillance data is therefore an essential frontier for understanding and ultimately combating 64 these pathogens [11, 12]. 65 4 For zoonoses, three epidemiological measures are crucial for summarizing transmission 66 dynamics and informing risk assessments. The first of these is the spillover rate, which indicates 67 how frequently the pathogen is transmitted from the animal reservoir into humans and helps 68 inform the total expected disease incidence [13]. The second measure describes the pathogen's 69 potential for further spread once in the human population and is commonly assessed using the 70 reproductive number (R), which gives the average number of secondary human cases caused by 71 an infectious individual [14, 15]. Values of R greater than one indicate that the pathogen is 72 capable of sustained (i.e. 'supercritical') transmission in humans. Pathogens with subcritical 73 transmission (R less than one but greater than zero) can cause limited chains of transmission in 74 humans after a zoonotic introduction, and they pose a risk of acquiring ability for supercritical 75 transmission via evolutionary or environmental change [2,5,16]. The third epidemiological 76 measure is the distance over which human-to-human transmission occurs, which informs how 77 the disease will spread spatially and the risk of it being introduced into new populations. 78",

However, these approaches 122 either require detailed case investigations to determine whether a case was infected by a zoonotic 123 or human source or assume that each cluster is caused by one single spillover event followed by 124 human-to-human transmission. A likelihood-based approach for estimating R for human-to-125 human transmission using only symptom onset dates of cases was introduced by Wallinga and 126 Teunis [31]. This method was extended to apply to zoonotic systems by Lo Iacono et al. [32], but 127 the extension requires that chains of exclusively human-to-human transmission can be identified, 128 and is thus not applicable to many zoonotic surveillance systems where human and zoonotic 129 transmissions are intermixed. A different approach was taken by White and Pagano [33], who 130 introduced a different likelihood-based method that compares the observed number of cases on 131 each day with the expected number, as calculated using the number and timing of previous cases. 132",

This value is slightly higher than previous estimates of R for the 1980s DRC 555 monkeypox dataset, which was estimated as 0. formation methods were liable to miss transmissions that occurred between localities. Indeed, the 560 estimate obtained using the locality-level model (R = 0.29) closely matches previous estimates. It 561 is also possible that the district-level model may overestimate the amount of human-to-human 562 transmission in the same way that the region-and country-level models picked up a higher signal 563 of human-to-human transmission than the district-level model due to their larger broader contact 564 zone sizes. The size of the DRC's districts and administrative subregions used for the district-565 level model vary in size, but average around fifteen thousand square kilometers, or around one 566 hundred forty kilometers across, encompassing a much greater distance than most human-to-567 human transmission events likely occur over. We therefore expect that the true value of R is 568 bounded by the estimates of the locality-level and the district-level models. 569",

Without information about disease 627 dynamics in the reservoir, accounting for this heterogeneous spillover will be challenging, but This work assumes that R is constant across all localities; however, to obtain a full picture 635 of pathogen emergence risk, it may be necessary to consider the heterogeneity in transmission 636 intensity among different human populations, as well as the interplay between where R is highest 637 versus where spillover tends to occur [61]. In some zoonotic systems, for instance, spillover 638 predominantly occurs into remote villages and towns that are in close proximity to forested 639 regions. However, we generally expect these villages to have lower levels of human-to-human 640 transmission than the more densely-packed cities [62-64]. A pathogen may even be incapable of 641 supercritical spread until it reaches such a city. Therefore, to assess the probability a pathogen 642 will successfully emerge and to determine which populations to target with control measures, it 643 may be necessary to establish not only the spillover rate and R across different populations, but 644 also the rate of dispersal of the pathogen between those populations [61]. 645",

The expected 762 number of spillover events per locality per day (\u03bb z ) was given a uniform prior with a lower bound 763 of zero and an upper bound selected to be far above the converged posterior distribution (ranging 764 from 0.0075 to 1, see S10 Fig for comparison of spillover priors and posterior distributions). 765 The chains were run for 100,000 steps, with a burn-in of 20,000.

This approach combines a 773 complexity measure, used to capture the effective number of parameters in each model, with a 774 measure of fit in order to perform model comparisons. Models are rewarded for better 775 'goodness-of-fit' to the data and penalized for increasing model complexity. Similarly to the well-known Akaike information criterion (AIC) model comparisons, models with smaller DIC 777 values are preferred. As a rule of thumb, a difference between models' scores of four or more 778 generally indicates that the model with the larger value is 'considerably less' well supported by 779 the empirical evidence [69].

Case records. For all individuals included in the analyses, records the case 1178 identification number, the locality identification number, the day of surveillance when disease 1179 onset occurred (the first day of fever when known, otherwise the first day of the rash), the names 1180 of the district and region where the case occurred, and masked GPS coordinates of the locality. 1181The geographic masking technique known as 'donut masking' was used to obscure the exact 1182 location of cases and preserve privacy. For each locality with a recorded location, two random 1183 values were drawn: the first determines the direction and the second determines the distance 1184 from the original point. The new location is within 0.1 degrees from the original point but not 1185 closer than 0.02 degrees. 1186 1187 S2 Data. Contact-tracing links. Each row provides the case identification numbers for a pair of 1188 cases that was identified as a probable transmission link through epidemiological contact-more cases. This can be done for each locality by multiplying its component of the 1211 likelihood by the inverse of the probability (q) of having one or more cases",
