High-mannose-type oligosaccharides are transferred from lipid-linked intermediates to asparagine residues of the enzymes as they enter the ER . To this point, the acid hydrolases share the route of biosynthesis and transport with all other secretory glycoproteins . However, each acid hydrolase contains information which allows it to be recognized by an addressing enzyme which transfers GlcNAc 1-P residues from UDPGlcNAc to mannose residues on the acid hydrolases . A second enzyme, which is greatly enriched in smooth membranes, removes the covering GlcNAc residues to expose Man 6-P recognition markers. This phosphodiester glycosyl hydrolase converts the enzyme into a high affinity ligand for the Man 6-P receptor. The newly synthesized enzymes bind to Man 6-P receptors which collect into vesicles for delivery to lysosomes . Apparently, the receptor-bound enzymes enter an acidic compartment where the low pH allows enzymes to dissociate from receptors, so the Man 6-P receptors can recycle and be reutilized. Lysosomotropic mines raise the pH of this compartment, prevent ligand release from receptor, and thus block receptor reutilization.

The N-terminal signal sequence of these proteins is cleaved during their secretion across the inner membrane into the periplasmic space. The leucine-specific binding protein (LS-BP) protein of E. & is a periplasmic protein involved in high affinity transport of leucine. ribosomes as a precursor with a 2 3 amino acid signal sequence. Pulse-labeling experiments with intact cells have shown that the completed precursor can be initially detected in the inner membrane and chased into the processed protein which is in the periplasmic space. The processing and secretion of the LS-BP can be inhibited by a variety of reagents including phenethyl alcohol and the proton ionophore, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, also inhibits processing in spheroplasts. Processing can be restored in the CCCP and valinomycin treated cells by dilution into fresh medium. The concentration of CCCP inhibitory to processing also reduce the membrane potential of the inner membrane. When processing is inhibited, the precursor form of the LS-BP can be lsolated with the inner membrane fraction. Only the mature form of the binding proteins is sensitive to osmotic shock treatment or spheroplast formation. These results suggest that the membrane potential plays an important role in the orientation of the precusor form of certain secretory proteins within the membrane to allow proper processing and secretion. We are currently studying the structural requirements for sensitivity to the membrane potential. In one approach we have examined internal deletions of the LS-BP missing up to 78 amino acid residues near the C-terminus. These altered binding proteins exhibit norm1 processing and secretion but they are rapidly degraded in the periplasm. The mature binding proteins are resistant to the periplasmic proteases. Attempts are being made to obtain strains devoid of periplasmic protease activity.",

Final maturation requires the removal of extra N-terminal residues having a repeating (-Glu-Ala-), or (-Asp-Ala-) structure and is catalyzed by a heat-stable membrane-bound dipeptidyl aminopeptidase ( 4 ) . This step and several other post-translational modifications of prepro-a-factor have been studied in a cells carrying temperature-sensitive mutations (E) that block secretion ( 5 ) . Mutants that are blocked at very early stages in the secretory process, prior to or during translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), accumulate a form of prepro-a-factor that is indistinguishable in molecular weight (MW) from the protein synthesized in vitro with polyA+ RNA from a cells. Mutants that overaccumulate ER-like structures, and apparently block further secretory movement, accumulate a single higher MW form of prepro-a-factor. The increase in MW is consistent with the addition of three N-linked mannose-rich oligosaccharide chains. If glycosylation is prevented in vivo by the presence of tunicamycin, or if the glycosyl chains are removed from the high MW form by treatment with endoglycosidase H in vitro, the MW is reduced to that of the -in vitro translation product, suggesting that during translocation of prepro-a-factor into the lumen of the ER the signal sequence is not removed.

            "text": "In reticulocytes, ATP has been suggested to enhance proteolysis, by allowing conjugation of substrate proteins to ubiquitin. However, proteins whose amino groups are blocked so that they can't be linked to ubiquitin still undergo ATP-stimulated proteolysis. Ihese experiments suggest that ATP serves distinct roles at different steps in the degradative process. Ihe ATP-activated process, which is independent of ubiquitin, involves ATP cleavage and is inhibited by hemin. It probably involves direct effects of ATP on a protease. In fact, vanadate, which inhibits ATP-dependent proteases in mitochondria and E. coli also affects this process in reticulocyte extracts. An alkaline protease that is activated two-fold by ATP has been prified from red cells. ?his endoprotease is very large (450,000 daltons) and has multiple active sites. Although this enzyme does not hydrolyze ATP, a variety of evidence indicates that it plays a key role in this degradative pathway. Melittin, the main constituent of bee venom, is derived from a precursor composed of 7 0 amino acids. Liberation of the lytic peptide requires three distinct processing steps: a) cleavage of the signal peptide; b) formation of the COOH-terminal amide with concomitant loss of a glycine; c) cleavage of the pro-region. Partially purified signal peptidase from rat liver has been shown to cleave prepromelittin at a single bond, the pre-pro junction. Both reaction products, promelittin and intact signal peptide, have been detected ( 1 ) . In collaboration with W. Wickner, it has moreover been shown that signal peptidase from E. coli also hydrolyzes prepromelittin at the same site. Hydrolysis of the pro-part proceeds via stepwise cleavage of dipeptides by a dipeptidylpeptidase (2). The enzyme from queen bee venom sacs has been isolated and studied in some detail. Caerulein, a decapeptide related to cholecystokinin and gastrin, is one of the main components in the skin secretion of Xenopus laevis. A cDNA bank was constructed from skin m W A and screened with cDNA primed with a deca-deoxynucleotide complementary to the mRNA sequence of the Trp-Met-Asp-?heregion of caerulein. Three different clones containing information for caerulein precursors have been sequenced. In each one, pairs of arginine residues flank a 1 5 amino acid peptide which includes the caerulein sequence. After cleavage Protein Transport and Secretion at, and excision of, these arginines, two more processing steps must take place to yield the decapeptide: a) formation of the terminal amide again involving a glycine residue; b) cleavage of the tetrapeptide Phe-Ala-Asp-Gly, which precedes the caerulein sequence in these precursors. The skin secretion of Xenopus laevis contains dipeptidylpeptidase activity which can liberate dipeptides terminating with alanine or glycine. We propose that stepwise cleavage of dipeptides represents a new type of precursor processing operating in the generation of peptides from bees, frogs as well as yeast (3). ",

Lilly Co., Indianapolis, IN 46285 The outer membrane lipoprotein (Lp) of E. coli is initially synthesized in the cytoplasm as a higher molecular weight precursor prolipoprotein (plp) which has an NH -terminal \"signal sequence\". The plp signal peptide shares several structural homologies wit% signal sequences from other bacterial secretory proteins which include: a) a positively charged NH -terminus; b) a sequence of 10-15 hydrophobic amino acids directly following the basic NH -t&dnus; c) serine and threonine residues following the hydrophobic core and located 2close to the carboxy-terminus; and d) glycine residues located within the hydrophobic domain. The functional significance of these regions with regard to protein secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane has been proposed in the loop model. To test the various proposals in this model, we have constructed a variety of specific mutations within the plp signal peptide using synthetic oligonucleotide directed mutagenisis. Examples of these Lp signal sequence mutations can be summarized as follows: 1) Alteration of the charge at the NH -terminus from +2 (wt) to +1, 0, and -2; 2) systematic replacement and/or deletion of t h two glycine residues in the hydrophobic core; and 3) replacement of the serine and threonine residues located close to the cleavage site. Analysis of the effects these mutations had on Lp biosynthesis and secretion has allowed us to elucidate the function of the various regions of the plp signal peptide in the secretion of this protein across the cytoplasmic membrane. By utilizing synthetic oligonucleotides in conjunction with recombinant-DNA methods the primary sequences of proteins can now be systematically altered, thus facilitating structurefunction studies of enzymes. specific substitutions at the nucleotide level in the structural genes of those enzymes. have initiated a study to determine the catalytic role of particular functional groups at the active sites of hydrolytic enzymes. By employing a specifically designed molecular linker, the nucleotide sequence for pBR322 6-lactamase was modified in order to replace the activesite serine by a cysteine residue. The resulting mutant gene codes for a thiol-@-lactamase which remains active yet is chemically distinguishable from the wild-type serine enzyme.

The leucine specific binding protein (LS-BPI, a periplasmic component of the high affinity leucine transport system in E. coli is being used in our laboratory as a model to study the structural requirements for pro= secretion. LS-BP is initially synthesized as a precursor form with a 23 amino acid residue signal sequence that is removed during its secretion into the periplasm. A variety of reagents which alter the membrane potential such as CCCP and valinomycin inhibit the processing and secretion of LS-BP hut the inhibition can be reversed by dilution into fresh medium. These results suggest that the membrane potential plays a role in the secretion of the LS-BP probably by orienting the precursor molecule within the membrane. Using site directed mutagenesis internal deletion mutations resulting in the loss of up to 78 amino acid residues near the C terminus of the protein have been constructed. The secretion process and the sensitivity of secretion to CCCP of these altered LS-BP's appear to be normal. All of the processed mutants that we have isolated. however, are degraded in the periplasmic space. If processing is inhibited, the precursor accumulates in the membrane and is protected from degradation.

Among the bacterial enzymes which can be expressed in yeast, B-lactamase is of special interest, since the enzyme is synthesized as a preprotein in E. coli containing a signal sequence of 23 amino acids. Recently, we reported that the yeast cell is able to produce the active gene product by processing the bacterial precursor. Since the expression of the B-lactamase gene in yeast is low, the bacterial promoter was replaced by the yeast ADHl promoter leading to an 100-fold increase in enzyme activity. This allowed the purification of the mature form of blactamase from yeast crude extracts to apparent homogeneity. No difference with regard to molecular weight and specific activity could be detected when compared to the purified enzyme from E. coli. Furthermore, the amino terminal sequence was identical to that of the bacterial processed enzyme demonstrating that both bacteria and yeast recognize the same cleavage site. The amount of mature R-lactamase was calculated to be 0.1-0.2 Z of total yeast protein, demonstrating that substantial rates of processing of the precursor occurs in yeast. Despite this, the high rate of precursor synthesis led to its accumulation in the cell. Immunoassay and activity staining showed that the precursor protein is present in large excess over the processed form and has a very low specific activity compared to that of the mature enzyme. Current investigations concerning the location of B-lactamase in the cell and the question whether R-lactamase in yeast is cotranslationally processed at the yeast endoplasmic reticulum will be discussed.

The synthesis of these glycoproteins was analyzed in infected cells and in a cell-free system derived from rabbit reticulocyte lysates supplemented with dog pancreatic microsomes. The two rotavirus glycoproteins and their precursors were compared by immunoprecipitation, comparative peptide mapping, and digestion with beta-N-acetylglucosarninidase H (Endo H). The data showed that a 37K product synthesized in the cell-free system is the precursor to the 38K glycoprotein and that the 37K polypeptide contains a cleavable signal sequence (1.X). The 37K polypeptide was glycosylated in vitro in t h e presence of microsomes to a polypeptide of 38K that was irnmunoprecipitated by monospecific antiserum to VP7. Endo H digestion of the 38K polypeptides from either infected cells or the cell-free system produced polypeptides of identical molecular weight, 35.5K. This 35.5K polypeptide represents the glycoprotein precursor lacking the signal sequence. These results were confirmed by comparative studies with a variant of SAl1 that is defective in glycosylation of VP7. Similar experiments with the 20K precursor to the 29K nonstructural glycoprotein showed that the 20K polypeptide contains a noncleavable signal sequence. The synthesis of both the 38K and 29K glycoproteins required the presence of membranes, although glycosylation of the precursors was not necessary for membrane insertion. Both the 29K and the 38K glycoproteins were protected from trypsin digestion while in infected cell microsornal membranes. The 38K glycoprotein made in vitro in the presence of membranes was similarly protected, suggesting that the glycoproteins are extruded into membrane vesicles and glycosylated during synthesis.",

We have also characterized the electrophoretic profiles of the endogenouus acceptor glycoproteins of liver and other tissues and determined that acceptors for this enzyme are tissue-specific. In previous work (Koro and Marchase, Cell 30: In Press, 1982) we have demonstrated that the GlcPTase acceptor oligosaccharides derived from chick neural retina glycoproteins are similar to oligosaccharides from glycoproteins of neural retina bound to the cell surface through their interaction with the filamentous baseplate protein ligatin. This interaction of cell-surface glycoproteins with ligatin is mediated via terminal glucose-l-phosphates on their oligosaccharides. The GlcPTase we have described is similar to but distinct from the N-acetylglucosamine-l-phosphotrasferase described by Reitman and Kornfeld (2. w. a. 256: 4275, 1981) . We propose that GlcPTase also functions in the Golgi as a controlling enzyme in intracellular sorting of newly synthesized proteins, marking a particular subclass of glycoproteins for localization to the cell surface.

Cellular and mo~ecular events underlying the assembly of synapses are poorly understood, especially for neurons of the central nervous system. A high degree of ultrastructural interaction seems necessary to orchestrate the proper transport and positioning of synaptic constituents. However, conventional EM analysis of differentiating neurites and their growth cones has shown little evidence for interactions between the abundant cytoskeletal and membranous components. In order to gain a better picture of differentiating neurites, we have examined the growth cones of cultured CNS neurons using high voltage electron microscopy (HVEM). structures within a subcellular region, and examination of whole-mount specimens, rather than embedded and sectioned preparations, provides remarkable resolution. Our examination of growth cones has revealed a higher level of organization than previously seen, showing abundant linkages between smooth endoplasmic reticulum, microtubules, and filaments. Linkages between smaller vesicles via a filamentous network also are apparent throughout the growth cone but especially near the surface membrane. organelles may have important implications for the mechanisms of growth cone extension and retraction, for membrane assembly and pinocytosis, and for transmitter release. ( a , 6 ) integral membrane heterodimers, apparently originate from transmembrane intracellular three-chain (a,5 , y ) oligomers. A new monoclonal antibody, CYl, identifies a family of as many as three y chains that are individually translated in a reticulocyte system driven by mRNA from the B lymphoid cell Raji, in the absence of microsomes. Pulse-chase experiments with Raji cells, followed by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional electrophoretic analyses, show that these y chains are all involved in HLA-DR biosynthesis due to their intracellular association with a and 6 chains. However, syntheses and association of a , 6 and y chains are not synchronized. Pulse-labeled y chains do not associate with aand 6 chains until 60 min after translation. During this time, pulsed a and 6 chains undergo glycosylation steps and transport in association with \"cold\" y chains. These findings suggest that labeled y chains are post-translationally placed on stand-by in an intracellular pool. and are utilized in an orderly fashion, only after pre-existing \"cold\" Y chains have exited the pool. An oriented pool is an unusual finding in glycoprotein oligomer assembly. In long-term chases, the y chains immunoprecipitable by CY1 dissociate from HLA-DR oligomers and tend to disappear, while a-5 dimers are inserted in the surface membrane. The lysosomotropic agents NH4C1 and chloroquine cause a build-up of y chains, suggesting that lysosomal degradation is involved in y chain processing.",

This transloc3tion did not o~c u r in the presence of CCCP. Labeling studies with either [ Hlmannose or 1 Hlglucosamine showed that N-linked oligosaccharide addition occurred co-translationally in the rough membranes. At this stage, the core protein had a high-mannose oligosaccharide which was sensitive to endo H, and inhibited by tunicamycin. After 2 hours, these were processed to re istant forms, presumably in the golgi complex. Continuous labeling with [ Hlglucosamine up to 6h indicated that the core protein in the smooth membranes became increasingly insensitive to endo H with a concomitant increase in sensitivity to keratanase. These results suggest that the core protein, containing N-linked oligosaccharides, was synthesized in the rough membranes and translocated intact to smooth membranes where further glycosylation modifications and addition of glycosaminoglycan chains occur. whereas El is an 0-linked glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated. E2 forms the viral peplomers or spikes. It migrates readily to the plasma membrane of infected cells. Proteolytic cleavage of the E2 glycoprotein from 180K to 90K is required for coronavirusinduced cell fusion. The El glycoprotein is a matrix glycoprotein deeply embedded in the lipid bilayer. The intracellular transport of the El glycoprotein is restricted. Newly synthesized El is transported from the RER to the Golgi apparatus where glycosylation occurs. It appears likely that cellular enzymes are utilized for glycosylation of this 0-linked glycoprotein. Imunofluorescence and cytochemical experiments show that El accumulates in the Golgi apparatus and is not readily transported to the plasma membrane. We suggest that the restricted intracellular migration of the El glycoprotein may account for the intracellular budding site of coronaviruses. The coronavirus El glycoprotein represents an excellent model system for the study of the synthesis, transport and processing of 0-linked glycoproteins.",

Our data also show that the terminal sugars of the carbohydrate chains are added beyond the Golgi apparatus ,but before integration of the glycoproteins into the plasmamembrane. The influence of the viral glycoproteins on the social behavior of the infected cells is illustrated for glycoprotein gD.This glycoprotein is transported to the tight junctions of the cells and also accumulates in the focal adhesion plaques where the cells are in close contact with the growth substratum. The SFFV gp52 glycoprotein has been identified as a recombinant molecule involving substitutions and deletions of the MuLV env gene. Unlike the MuLV structural glycoproteins, gp52 is defective in its transport to the cell surface. W e have studied aspects of intracellular transport and membrane association of gp52 to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the defective transport process. To determine whether a spontaneous denaturation occurs leading to aggregation of gp52, we studied the surface expression of gp52 in cells grown at different temperatures, as well as the solubility of gp52 in low concentrations of Triton X-100. No evidence of aggregation or of a temperature-dependent difference in transport was obtained. I t was found that a panel of monoclonal antibodies to different epitopes of p15E, as well as an antiserum to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxy terminus of MuLV envelope precursors, failed to react with gp52. Despite the possible absence of membrane anchoring regions of MuLV envelope proteins known t o reside of plSE, gp52 was not found to be secreted into the culture fluids. Also, gp52 could be labelled with H-palmitic acid, suggesting a membrane association. Proteolytic digestion of intact microsomal vesicles did not reveal a detectable cytoplasmic tail under conditions where this could be demonstrated on MuLV envelope precursors.

Newly synthesized albumin and al-PI in the cell and medium prepared by innnunoprecipitation with the respective specific antibodies, were analyzed by electrofocusing and SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. In addition, the processing of carbohydrate chains of al-PI was determined by its response to Endo H digestion.

J. 37, [85] [86] . Spontaneous reactivation has now been shown to possess two remarkable features. First, all of the ST activity associated with reactivation was localized in low buoyant density vesicles (LDV; p=l.l g/cm3), while a topologically distinct ST that catalyzed transfer of sialic acid to an exogenous acceptor was localized in hybrids of inner and outer membranes, Second, LDV catalyzed de novo protein synthesis and reactivation of SP synthesis was obligatorily coupled to protein synthesis.

These results demonstrate that synthesis of specific membrane proteins are required \u20acor activation of the inactive ST complex. Five to 10% of the endogenous ST activity in 37OC membranes is localized in identical LDV suggesting the possibility that these vesicles are of physiological importance in membrane assembly processes and may represent functional adhesion sites between inner and outer membranes.

Microcomplement fixation analyses show that the concentration of LAP in human lenses is equal ro thar: in bovine lenses (0.02% dry lens mass). This result is in contrast to all rhe previous literature which indicates thar rhe activity of LAP in human Uens is much lower, if extant, than that observed in lenses of other vertibrates. The LAP in human lens is present as several electrophoretically distinct but immunologically indistinguishable species, some of which may be associated with high molecular weight components. Thus, the discrepancy between activity levels and concentration levels appears to derive from the fact that LAP is present but damaged and inactive in aged human lens. ments. It is possible that disease and age related inactivation of LAP results in an inability of the aged lens to degrade and remove altered lens proteins or polypeptides. This malfunction may be related to the accumulation and aggregation of proteins which result in cataract. Protection against proteolysis by the oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins has been widely reported. To investigate the mechanism of the protective effect, we utilized fibronectin (FN) and bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase). Nonglycosylated FN was degraded more rapidly than glycosylated FN by several proteases; this was due to the more rapidly degradation of the nonglycosylated fragment corresponding to the carbohydrate-rich, collagen-binding domain of the molecule. Other regions of the molecule were not more sensitive to proteases. Also, enzymatic removal of the charged terminal sialic acid did not significantly enhance the proteolytic susceptibility of the protein. When trypsin sensitivity of nonglycosylated RNase A was compared with three glycosylated species of RNase B which differed with respect to the size of the carbohydrate chain, RNase was digested 6-10 times more rapidly than fully glycosylated RNase B. rates, and chymotrypsin digestion was not as significantly influenced by the presence or size of the oligosaccharide chain. The clustering of carbohydrate chains in the collagen-binding domain of FN and the close proximity of the carbohydrate chain to the primary trypsin cleavage site of RNase suggest a direct steric hindrance of protease substrate interaction. The presence of carbohydrates may be biologically significant since i) intactness of the FN polypeptide chain is essential for its binding to collagen and ii) cleavage at the RNase tryptic sites results in loss of most of its enzymatic activity.

The new plasmid has been designed to allow the study of the translocation and processing of the 6-lactamase, by the construction of a number of point and deletion mutations in the signal codons of the bla gene. In addition, pTG2 might be used as a cloning vehicle for the export of proteins out of the cytoplasm.

J. 07110 We previously showed that enkephalin-containing peptides (EC-peptides) are markedly increased in rat adrenal glands after denervation (1). On reinvestigating this phenomenon, we found that in unilaterally denervated rats there was a lag of 12-24 hr before EC-peptides increased. Maximal increase (ca. 12-fold) was at 72 hr and mainly in the largest EC-peptides, representing either proenkephalin or large fragments of it. There were only small increases in free enkephalins and in intermediate-size EC-peptides even after 96 hr, indicating an extremely low rate of processing. As before, there were no increases in the contralateral innervated glands at any time, nor in adrenals of sham-operated rats. By contrast, catecholamines (CA) increased in both denervated and innervated glands within 30 min of transection, with maximal levels (6-9-fold) at 12 hr. There were similar increases in sham-operated rats, indicating that the effects were due to the surgery. and innervated glands had returned to normal. This clear dissociation between the effect of denervation on enkephalins and on CA is interesting since both are present in the same chromaffin granules and are released concomitantly by nerve stimulation. The immediate increase in adrenal CA is probably due to activation of preformed CA synthesizing enzymes. The long lag period and the fact that the increase is mainly in what appears to be the gene product proenkephalin suggests that activation in this case is at the transcriptional level.",

Lewis, R.V., ef g . , (1981) The addition of tunicamycin (\"4) to the growth medium (1 vg/ml) inhibited N-glycosylation by 80-94% while protein synthesis was still 80-90% of control values. when cultured neuroblastoma cells (N18) were grown in the presence of TM, the number of sodium channels, as measured by high affinity saxitoxin (STX) binding, was reduced to 20-28% of control values over a 60 hour period. A Scatchard plot of the binding data revealed that growth in the presence of TM reduced Bmax from 69 fmol mg to 14 fmol/mg without a significant change in the KD (2.7 nM) . Neurotoxin-activated 42Nat-influx mediated by the sodium channel was similarly reduced. ZM also caused a reduction i n cell surface STX-receptors in the presence of chloroquine (CQ) suggesting that the block in N-glycosylation did not reduce the number of sodium channels solely by accelerating sodium channel degradation. After the washout of TM, STX receptors returned at a rate of 1930/cell/hr. The reappearance of sodium channels required protein synthesis. When sodium channel biosynthesis is blocked by either cycloheximide or \"74 the number of STX receptors are lost at a rate of 1730/cell/hr. These results demonstrate that N-glycosylation is required for the maintenance of normal levels of the sodium channel in neuroblastoma cells. SV40 cloning vector. This expressed 1TA has been shown to migrate to and insert into oniy the apical region of polarized epithelial monkey kidney cells. This is in agreement with previous findings that the HA i s localized to only the apical surface of epithelial cells and the virus itself buds only from the apical region. It has been shown that glycosylation is not responsible for the directional transport of the HA. Therefore, since the cloned HA migrates to the appropriate region, it is likely that features of its polypeptide backbone are responsible for its directional transport. The G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus in contrast to the HA of influenza is localized only to the basolateral region of polarized epithelial cells. To determine regions on the molecules which are responsible for the directional transport, hybrid genes were constructed in which specific areas of the HA gene were replaced by those of the VSV-G gene and the site of membrane insertion of these hybrid proteins was determined.",

The experimental discrimination of integral from peripheral membrane proteins, and the possibility of a finer discrimination among integral proteins of different structures, are the subjects of this study.

This technique relies on the properties of Triton X-114, which forms a homogeneous solution at O ' C but separates into detergent-rich(DRP) and detergent-poor(DPP) phases above 20\u00b0C. Bordier showed(loc.cit.), integral proteins such as glycophorin partition nearly completely into the DRP, whereas peripheral proteins such as spectrin go into the DPP. Similarly, the VSV G-protein and rhodopsin partition into the DRP. and the Na+,K+-ATPase show nearly equipartition between the DRP and DPP. Moreover, the acetylcholine receptor(AChR), clearly an integral protein, partitions completely into the DPP. in which it retained its multisubunit structure and binding capacity for 4-bungarotoxin. The results of the phase separation technique must therefore be interpreted with caution, because ve have shown that at least one integral protein(AChR) partitions indistinguishably from peripheral proteins. In addition, the technique may be useful in discriminating between integral proteins that exist either as monomers or as multimers(and/or pore-formers) in the membrane.

Leucoplasts in the developing endosperm of castor oil (R. communis) seeds are plastids specialized for the conversion of photosynthetically produced carbohydrate into fatty acids.

Incubation of isolated, intact plastids with labeled glycolytic intermediates y'elds results completely consistent with the isozyme localization data. nation of plastids from other sources supports the use of Ricinus leucoplasts as a model system. It is hewn from formal genetic analysis that spinach chloroplast aldolase and glucose-P isomerase, and Clarkia chloroplast glucose-P isomerase are coded for by nuclear DNA. No data is available for any other glycolytic or pentose-P enzyme from any plant source. We have begun to examine developing castor oil seeds for the site of transcriptioq and translation of phosphofructokinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Initial results suggest that, in analogy to the small subunit of ribulose 1,s-P2 carboxylase,plastid enolase is coded for by nuclear DNA, synthesized in the cytosol as a high.Mr precursor, and transported post-translationally into the leucoplasts. Libraries of plastid and nuclear DNA are being assembled in order to probe unambiguously the coding location for the glycolytic and pentose-P enzymes. Supported by NSERC of Canada.

In S . pneumoniae isoleucine accumulation is monitored by a single A+ energized transporter. When wild type bacteria are submitted to sublethales concentrations of methotrexate (MTX), Vi of isoleucine transport increases from its standard valine 5.7 nmol./min/mg proteins to 19.8 nmol,/min/mg proteins. No change is observed in Vi of glutamine uptake which is A+ independant. This effect occurs in the absence of protein synthesis. Analysis of the membrane composition of treated and non treated wild type bacteria in bidimension electrophoresis (0-Farrell gels) show four additional spots in the membrane of MTX treated bacteria. The results obtained suggest strongly that these spots correspond to proteins which are solubilized during the sonication of the non treated bacteria while they remain in the membrane in KTX treated bacteria.",

The X receptor in K12 is an outer membrane protein needed for the adsorption of various phages and for the entry of maltose (at low external concentration) and maltodextrins. By analysing the sequence changes and the dominance properties in mutants resistant to phages using the 1 receptor we obtain information on the functional topology of the protein. The ability to find its location and to assemble can be also considered as a function and is thus within the reach of this approach.

Using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe complementary to a portion of the predicted nucleotide sequence of the a-factor coding region, two discrete chromosomal segments were isolated from a library of cloned yeast DNA fragments. DNA sequence analysis of one of these segments indicates that it could potentially code for a larger precursor polypeptide which, unlike the a-factor precursor, contains only a single copy of the Val-containing molecule at its carboxyl terminal end. Immediately preceding the a-factor sequence is a pair of basic residues which, as is the case for other peptide hormone precursors, provides a site for endoproteolytic cleavage. appears to lack any region with a repeating (-Glu/Asp-Ala-), structure. sequence contained in the precursor is highly homologous to that of the peptides analyzed by Duntze et&, it is not completely identical. Nevertheless, it seems that the cloned segment is an expressed and functional %-factor gene because a complementary polyA+ RNA is found only in 5 cells and because presence of the cloned gene on a multi-copy plasmid causes 5 cells to overproduce 5-factor activity at least 10-fold as determined by a bioassay. We have recently isolated a periplasmic binding protein from a Pseudomonas putida specific for myo-inositol. In order to study i t s biosynthesis, pulse labelling and imnuno p r e c i p x t i o n were undertaken. A f a i n t band appears in polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis being 1800 daltons heavier than the mature protein (30000 daltons). This band, suspected to be a precursor, disappears upon chase and i s increased i f the cells were preincubated with procaine or TAME. Fingerprints would acertain this band as being the precursor.The genetics of the myo-inositol transport system has been undertaken in this strain. Transport mutants, affected in the affinity and in the capacity, have been isolated.
