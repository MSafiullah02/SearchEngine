The structural approach to revealing changes in virus substructures can be of unique importance in determining viral structural dynamics. However, few molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out to investigate MERS CoV structural changes and the dynamical aspects of MERS CoV molecular domains (Alfuwaires et al., 2017). The viral membrane fusion protein is a rational target for drug discovery, as inhibition of the viral membrane fusion function can lead to cessation of the replication cycle (Liu et al., 2004; Yao and Compans, 1996; Vanderlinden et al., 2010). This approach proved good efficiency against several viral infections as HIV (Carravilla and Nieva, 2018), SARS CoV (Liu et al., 2009) and respiratory syncytial virus (Mackman et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Viral membrane fusion can be accomplished by fusion of the virus spike with a host cell receptor target (Bosch et al., 2003). In most enveloped viruses, the spike protein is composed of two cleavable protein domains that can be cleaved by proteases. This property was recorded with SARS CoV, MERS CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Xu et al., 2004). However, they show considerable structural differences including the size, composition of fusion proteins and the sites of protein cleavage (Yuan et al., 2017; Wicht et al., 2014). The CoV spike is composed of two proteins, S1 and S2. There are two consecutive events that occur at the start of cell infection. The first step is virus attachment, in which S1 comes into contact with the host receptor. For MERS CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is the target for binding with host cells (Wang et al., 2013; Kandeel et al., 2014). Soon after attachment, S1 is cleaved by proteolytic enzymes to expose a highly hydrophobic membrane binding domain of S2 (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016). S2 is the fusion protein that integrates with the host cell membrane; its integration is followed by fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. In MERS CoV and the highly related SARS CoV, S2 is associated with protein fusion process (Liu et al., 2004; Forni et al., 2015). During fusion, major conformational changes occur in S2, forming a six-helical bundle (6HB) of three-stranded coiled coils (Lu et al., 2014). Each S2 subdomain contains two motifs, heptad repeat domain 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat domain 2 (HR2). HR1 forms a homotrimer exposing three hydrophobic pockets on its surface (Xia et al., 2014). S2 HR domains pass through three conformational changes during viral membrane fusion. The first is pre-fusion state, in which both HR1 and HR2 are not bound together. The second is pre-hairpin intermediate state in which 6HB is formed. HR2 packs into the three major hydrophobic grooves of HR1. The last stage is stable hairpin formation, thus bringing the viral and cell membranes into proximity, forming membrane bilayer and starting viral membrane fusion (Gao et al., 2013). When three HR1 motifs align together, the central core is predominantly composed of hydrophobic residues. A HR domain is composed of tandem repeat motifs of seven residues, named from a to g. Of the seven residues, the first (a) and fourth (d) are predominantly hydrophobic or bulky (Gao et al., 2013). This feature is the main forerunner in coiled coil formation and becomes stabilized by the long hydrophobic interface. Previous reports showed that CoV spike is assembled in the form of trimers (Lu et al., 2014). It was reported that there are many unassembled monomers found in the cells as well as on the virion surface (Delmas and Laude, 1990). Trimers are the accepted form of completing the fusion process. The functional and dynamical aspects of discrete spike monomers in virions are still not well understood. In this work, we carried out a comparison of structural dynamics of S2 monomer and trimer from MERS CoV.",

Quantitative assessment of the changes in protein structure using MD simulation will help in understanding the global and local changes of protein domains or subdomains and support the future design of suitable compounds to modulate protein function. Classical tools such as root mean square deviation (RMSD) and more recent algorithms using global distance test (GDT_TS) and contact area difference (CAD) scores are used to evaluate and compare different structures (Olechnovic et al., 2013). To date, only a few studies have been carried out to investigate the MD of viral membrane fusion in general, and specific studies for MERS CoV are scarce. In this work, we used MD simulation to reveal changes in MERS CoV HR structure during fusion and factors affecting HR stability. MD simulation, energy system stability, RMSD, hydrogen bonding, contact mapping of inter-residue and inter-HR interactions, GDT_TS, and CAD scores were used to evaluate HR stabilization mechanisms. For this purpose, we simulated the MERS CoV S2 protein in the YASARA structure software followed by comprehensive analysis with YASARA built-in analysis macros and webservers for the calculation of global and local changes in distance and contact change measures.",

Sixteen Na+ and 12 Cl\u2212 (26 Na+ and 14 Cl\u2212) ions were included in the monomer (trimer) case to neutralize the system. Periodic boundary conditions (Jorgensen et al., 1983), a constant temperature of 298 K (controlled by Langevin temperature piston), the NVT canonical ensemble, and the particle-mesh Ewald summation for long range interactions were used. After a steepest-descent energy minimization to remove atomic overlaps, the systems were equilibrated for 0.5 ns, followed by a 50 ns production run with data collection every 2 ps. All simulations were run with SHAKE (Ryckaert et al., 1977) using a 2 fs time step.",

MD simulation is a widely used technique for understanding structural protein changes in response to different effectors (Alfuwaires et al., 2017; Moore et al., 1998; Shen et al., 2003; Kandeel and Kitade, 2018). In this study, MD simulation was run in a system comprising monomer or trimer of MERS CoV S2 HR. The stability of each system was evaluated by changes in RMSD as well as changes in the system energy. In order to get maximal precision, the MD simulation results were compared from two different software programs by implementing two different force fields, AMBER14 and CHARMM. All MD simulations showed rapid energy stabilization for both HR monomer and trimer. Fig. 1\nshows the changes in RMSD for each structure in relation to time in ps. HR trimer showed rapid stabilization at less than 5 ns, having constant low fluctuations in RMSD and remaining around 3 \u00c5 over the entire recorded simulation. In contrast, S2 monomer from two structures was less stable, showing high fluctuations in RMSD with major drifts at 25\u201330 ns (Fig. 1A). Despite the lower RMSD observed for the monomer in 3MOD structure, it shows high fluctuations in RMSD. This indicates that monomer of S2 bears high flexibility and instability, while trimer constitutes the more or less rigid state of S2. This agrees with the prediction models and resolved structures indicating that S2 of SARS CoV (Deng et al., 2006; Bernini et al., 2004) and of MERS CoV could arrange into trimers (Gao et al., 2013). Additionally, the results from NAMD CHARMM run (Fig. 1B) was highly comparable with YASARA AMBER14, indicating conserved features of trimer stability and monomer dynamic nature. Fig. 1C shows the energy during MD simulation and indicates the stability of the trimer at lower energy level.",

In S2 monomer, there was more generalized change in RMSD with clear differences at a) the N and C-termini of the HR complex, b) in the middle of the HR1 helix, and c) in the linker between HR1 and HR2. In contrast, the trimeric structures showed different profiles, with major changes in the linker and C-terminal regions and little or no change in other HR regions (Fig. 2A).

For more accurate consideration of global changes and accurate inclusion of flexible or terminal highly mobile loops, analysis was also performed using GDT_TS. In agreement with RMSD, GDT_TS revealed the stability of MERS CoV S2 trimer (Table 1\n). The percentages of superimposable residues within 1, 2, 4, or 8 \u00c5 in trimer were 2- to 3-fold higher than in monomer. This reflects the more dynamic nature of S2 monomer during MD simulation.

The position of residues in these repeats can be termed a, b, c, d, e, f and g. Of special interest are the residues at positions a and d; which are located almost in the center of the HR, are predominantly bulky and hydrophobic, and share in establishing the hydrophobic core of HR. Position a is represented by residues F1012, F1019, V1026, and L1033, while position d comprises residues F1001, M1008, T1015, V1022, and L1036. MD simulation revealed that residues at a and d positions are most stable, having the least changes in RMSD in comparison with the initial structure. The average RMSD after MD simulation for residues at a and d positions (RMSDad) was found to be smaller than the average of all residues. For HR1, the average RMSDad was 4.37 \u00c5 and 0.93 \u00c5 for HR monomer and trimer, respectively. Similarly, the RMSDad for HR2 was 3.9 \u00c5 for monomer and 1.01 \u00c5 for trimer. These values are much lower than the general RMSD averages of 4.98 \u00c5 for monomer and 1.49 \u00c5 for trimer (Table 2\n).",

            "text": "To determine the key factors governing the stabilization of viral HR, the inter-HR1-HR2 contacts were analysed. Residue-residue contacts were also analysed for their energy contributions to HR stabilization. During residue-residue contact calculations, the contact interaction could be significant if the interaction energy was below \u22121.26 kJ/mol. For the identification of key residues in contacts between HR1 and HR2, the contact value and number of residues were calculated. In all of the analysed data, there was no positive or repulsive energy. After MD simulation, the total number of contacts was increased for the trimer and to a lesser extent in monomer (Table 3\n). Analysis of every HR residue-residue contact revealed three different levels of interaction energy: a) high interaction energy above 10 kJ/mol, b) medium interaction energy of 4\u201310 kJ/mol, and c) low interaction energy of 1\u20134 kJ/mol. The high interaction residue contacts occurred at two positions: first, just in proximity to the N-terminal of HR2, between K1021and Q1023 of HR1 and D1261 and L1262 of HR2; second, distal to the C-terminal of HR2, including the interactions between Q994, K1000, D1282, and E1285 (Fig. 4\nA). Parallel to the high interaction residues, several lines of medium interaction energy residues were observed (Fig. 4B). These medium interaction residues were distributed at almost regular intervals starting at the end of the linker between HR1 and HR2 (residues E1039 and L1252) and at residues T1257, L1259, L1269, and D1282. Weak interaction energy contacts fill the gaps between the previously described high and medium interaction contacts. This described profile applies to both monomer and trimer. However, in trimer there was an additional high-energy interaction at the start of the linker region. Therefore, it is suggested to consider the interaction energy of residues during the design of new antiviral membrane fusion agents based on short peptides.",

Analysis of A-A contacts revealed a wider area of contact changes in monomer from GLY1045 to LEU1085, while in trimer more restricted distances were seen from GLN1063 to PHE1073. The CAD score was higher for trimer than monomer (Table 4\n). This agrees with the lower RMSD for trimer and indicates low perturbations in trimer and high perturbations in monomer. The residues showing red spots on CAD superimposition plots also had the highest RMSDs in both monomer and trimer. This indicates the feasibility of using RMSD for evaluation of structural changes. Fig. 6\nshows local contact area differences plotted on a colour scale for both MERS CoV S2 monomer and trimer before and after MD. Monomer showed more dispersed red spots, indicating larger changes in contact areas. While A-A analysis shows small areas of contact changes, A-S and S-S determinations show larger contact area changes.",

By MD simulation, we show that monomer is more dynamic and its residues have more positional fluctuation than in trimer. Furthermore, HR2 recognition by HR1 occurs through three levels of energetic interaction, with high, medium, and low energies distributed in parallel patterns along the HR. The hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions of HR helices have the smallest RMSDs. GDT_TS and CAD scores coincide well with RMSD data, supporting the finding that monomer is unstable and undergoes large fluctuations. Based on these results, the design of peptide analogues could consider the energetic and dynamic aspects of HR1 and HR2 interactions. Since discrete or unassembled monomers are found in the cell and in virions, the noticed flexibility and high dynamics of spike monomers might modulate the virus infection process. Additionally, the stable less dynamic trimer might be required in stabilizing the viral-cell membrane hairpin formation in preparation for fusion of virus and cells.",
