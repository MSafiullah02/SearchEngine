Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is currently one treatment with a potential for long-term disease control although its curative potential is debated. This is in part due to the graft-vs-myeloma effect, mediated by immune competent donor lymphocytes, best illustrated by the induction of sustained (molecular) remissions following donor lymphocyte infusions,8 but could also be due in part to absence of contaminating myeloma cells in the donor graft and documented lower levels of residual disease.9, 10",

Patients were evaluated for suitability for transplant based on treatment protocols in effect at the time. Patient records, laboratory, X-rays and marrow aspirates were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of MM. To be considered for marrow transplantation, patients had to meet the established criteria for active, symptomatic MM according to Durie and Salmon22 and had to have received at least one cycle of conventional dose chemotherapy. Patients with a Karnofsky score of <50, a pulmonary diffusion capacity of <50% of predicted and symptomatic heart failure were excluded. Non-ablative transplant candidates were allowed to enroll with a diffusion capacity as low as 30%. Standard hematologic and chemistry studies were used to evaluate organ function. A suitable marrow donor was required, which included HLA identical relatives, HLA haplo-identical relatives or an unrelated donor who was phenotypically HLA identical, or single allele or Ag HLA-mismatched at class I with the patient. Transplants occurred between January 1975 and September 2008. The date of last follow-up was August 2011.",

The initial analysis compared outcomes using non-myeloablative conditioning for the allogeneic transplant vs those with myeloablative conditioning. In the analysis of relapse or progression, time-dependent competing risks of treatment failure such as death from TRM were included. Cox regression models for these outcomes were adjusted for patient age (continuous), donor sex, chemotherapy responsive vs resistant disease, related vs unrelated donor, time from diagnosis to transplant (<2.5 years vs >2.5 years), prior radiation, prior number of chemotherapy regimens (continuous), \u03b2-2 microglobulin >4.0 either at diagnosis or transplant, and abnormal cytogenetics or FISH either at diagnosis or transplant. Abnormal cytogenetics included multiple abnormalities or any abnormality by conventional cytogenetics other than hyperdiploidy. Abnormal FISH included deletion 13, deletion 17, translocation 4;14, 14;16, or 14;20. Because data were missing for some patients, data available for abnormalities were compared with patients who had no abnormalities and patients with missing data.

In contrast, only three patients receiving non-ablative transplants died of any of these causes. The major causes of death among recipients of non-ablative transplants were mostly chronic GVHD (n=12) and progressive disease (n=50). At the time of last follow-up, August 2011, among 144 patients receiving ablative conditioning, 14 were alive a median of 15.1 years (3.6\u201323.5) post transplant, of whom 6 had relapsed. Among 134 patients receiving non-ablative conditioning, 56 were alive a median of 7.1 years (2.9\u201312.9) post transplant, of whom 25 had relapsed. At 2 years, the probabilities of non-relapse mortality were 18% and 55% for non-ablative and ablative regimens, respectively. At 6 years, the probabilities of relapse or disease progression were 55% and 34% for non-ablative and ablative regimens, respectively. For patients undergoing ablative allo-SCTs, the probabilities of OS and PFS are 11 and 8% at 15 years. For patients undergoing non-ablative transplants, the probabilities of OS and PFS are 39 and 16% at 10 years. (Figure 1) The best outcomes were found among 88 patients who received an autologous transplant, followed by a non-myeloablative allograft within 4 months of the autologous transplant and who had not progressed after a prior autologous transplant. (Figure 2) Their 10-year OS was 49% and PFS was 27%.",

Mortality censored for relapse was 55% among the 144 patients receiving ablative transplants compared with only 18% in the non-myeloablative group. As a result, the survival at 10 years from transplant was significantly superior for non-ablative transplants, 35% compared with 15%. As these two groups were not prospectively studied and were not treated contemporaneously, it is likely that other factors including better anti-infectious prophylaxis and treatment, and the use of PBSCs may have contributed in part to these improvements. Indeed, there were almost no deaths due to viral or fungal pathogens among non-myeloablative recipients; a major cause of mortality among ablative transplant recipients. In addition, there were major differences between the groups in patient age, relapse after prior autologous transplant, and proportion of patients resistant to their last chemotherapy regimen just before transplant. Although the perception is that patients with MM tolerate allografting more poorly than patients with other hematologic malignancies, a recent analysis from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation suggested that when adjusted for risk factors including age, disease stage, interval from diagnosis to transplant and donor factors, outcomes for patients with MM were similar.24 Additionally, there are now newer drugs available to treat relapse that were not available previously which would certainly affect survival after relapsed disease.",

Although this result does not appear to agree with the analysis of others such as the EBMT registry data, the study was only a univariate analysis and did not account for competing causes of death, as ours did.25 Nevertheless, the amount of residual disease present at transplant, provides a greater challenge for clearance by the allogeneic donor graft when a non-myeloablative regimen is utilized and is still the primary cause of treatment failure. When comparing the incidences of chronic GVHD, 27% of the ablative recipients developed CGVHD compared with 66% for non-ablative recipients. As the risk of CGVHD is time-dependent, and more non-myeloablative patients survived the early phases of transplant, this did not prove to be significantly higher when adjusted for competing causes of death.",
