Itraconazole therapy was withdrawn through lack of efficacy in one cat (a Persian) and unacceptable adverse effects in the other (a Maine Coon). Both cats achieved clinical and mycological cure after 12-14 weeks therapy with 26-31 mg kg -1 terbinafine every 24 h per os (PO). Clinical signs in the Maine Coon resolved completely after 7 weeks treatment. Four weeks of therapy with additional weekly washes with a 2% chlorhexidine/2% miconazole shampoo following clipping produced a 98% reduction in the Persian cat's mycetoma, which was then surgically excised. Recurrent generalized dermatophytosis in the Persian cat has been managed with pulse therapy with 26 mg kg -1 terbinafine every 24 h PO for 1 week in every month. No underlying conditions predisposing to dermatophytosis were found in either cat despite extensive investigation. Terbinafine administration was associated with mild to moderate lethargy in the Persian cat, but no other adverse effects or changes in blood parameters were seen. To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first report of a dermatophyte mycetoma in a Maine Coon and of successful resolution of this condition in cats following terbinafine therapy.",

            "text": "Terbinafine is an allylamine fungicidal agent that interferes with squalene epoxidase, disrupting ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell wall leading to an accumulation of squalene. 9,10 It is highly lipophilic and keratinophilic, concentrating in body fat and keratinized tissues. Fungicidal concentrations can be detected in feline hair after 9 days treatment and detectable levels persist for at least 8 weeks following 14 days oral therapy (30-40 mg kg -1 ) every 24 h. 9,10 Terbinafine has a limited impact on mammalian cytochromes and there are few reported adverse effects or drug interactions. 9, 10 The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against most dermatophytes, including M. canis, M. gypseum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes is low (MIC 90 = 0.03 \u03bcg mL -1 ). 11, 12 Several studies have reported efficacy in feline dermatophytosis at doses of 8.25-40 mg kg -1 for 14-120 days in naturally and experimentally affected cats, 10,13-16 although terbinafine is not licensed for animals. It is thought that lower doses are less effective and 30-40 mg kg -1 once daily is currently recommended. 9, 13, 17 There is only one report of the use of terbinafine to treat feline dermatophyte pseudomycetoma, in which a Persian cat failed to respond to 4 months of treatment at 14.5 mg kg -1 every 24 h followed by another 4 months at 30 mg kg -1 every 24 h. 7 The low cost, good safety profile and efficacy in other dermatophyte infections nevertheless make terbinafine a potentially useful treatment option worthy of further study. In contrast to the first case, this report describes successful management of dermatophyte mycetomas associated with terbinafine sensitive M. canis in two cats treated with 26-31 mg kg -1 terbinafine per os (PO) every 24 h.",

Although MICs were not provided to the authors, the M. canis isolates in this study were reported to be sensitive to terbinafine in a standard broth dilution assay; 18 in vitro sensitivity of the M. canis in the earlier case study was not reported.

In vitro antifungal sensitivity testing of dermatophyte isolates from animals, furthermore, is not a standardized procedure.",

Previously reported adverse effects of this drug include mild to moderate vomiting in 8-40% of treated cats 10,13,14 and erythema, pruritus and urticaria in two of 10 cats in one study. 9 To the authors' knowledge this is the first reported example of a dermatophyte mycetoma in a Maine Coon and only the second case in a Persian cat. 3 Most previous cases have been pseudomycetomas in Persian cats. 1, 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] Persian cats and Maine Coons are both long-haired breeds, although they are not thought to be closely related. It has been suggested, though not proven, that dermatophyte pseudomycetomas are associated with breed-related immunodeficiency or an aberrant immune response to dermatophytes. 1, 2 The reason for the failure to achieve permanent clinical and mycological cure in the Persian cat with systemic and topical therapy is still obscure. Eventual self-cure of dermatophytosis (but not mycetoma or pseudomycetoma) associated with cell-mediated immunity is considered normal in cats, 1,2 and there was no evidence of any underlying disease or immunosuppression in either cat and both have remained systemically healthy to date. Persian cats are predisposed to chronic and recurrent dermatophytosis, possibly due to ineffective grooming, the cutaneous microenvironment or immunological deficits 1,2 However, interestingly, another Persian cat in the same household had negative fungal cultures throughout the entire period suggesting that the affected cat had unique predisposing factors or there was undetected residual infection in the skin or hair following the initial course of treatment.",

Ambos gatos obtuvieron cura cl\u00ednica y micol\u00f3gica tras 12-14 semanas de tratamiento con 26-31 mg/kg de terbinafina q24 por via oral (PO). Los signos cl\u00ednicos en el gato Maine Coon resolvieron por completo tras siete semanas de tratamiento. Cuatro semanas de tratamiento adicional con lavados semanales con un champ\u00fa con 2% de clorhexidina/2% miconazol tras rasurado produjo una reducci\u00f3n de un 98% en el micetoma del gato Persa que despu\u00e9s se extirp\u00f3 quirurgicamente. Dermatofitosis generalizada recurrente en el gato Persa habia sido controlada con terapia en pulso con 26 mg/kg de terbinafina q24 PO durante una semana de cada mes. No se descubrieron otras condiciones que pudieran haber predispuesto a la dermatofitosis en ninguno de los gatos. La administraci\u00f3n de terbinafina se asoci\u00f3 con letargia leve a moderada en el gato Persa, pero no se observaron otros efectos adversos o cambios en los par\u00e1metros sanguineos. Seg\u00fan nuestro conocimiento este es el primer caso reportado de un micetoma dermatof\u00edtico en un gato Maine Coon y de la resoluci\u00f3n con \u00e9xito de esta condici\u00f3n en gatos tras la administraci\u00f3n de terbinafina.",

            "text": "Zusammenfassung Microsporum canis, welcher sensitiv auf Itraconazol und Terbinafin war, wurde von zwei Katzen isoliert, die mit einer generalisierten Dermatophytose und einem Dermatophyten Mycetom pr\u00e4sentiert wurden. Die Therapie mit Itraconazol wurde bei einer Katze (einer Perserkatze) abgesetzt, da sie unwirksam war und bei der anderen Katze (einer Maine Coon Katze) wegen inakzeptablen Nebenwirkungen. Bei beiden Katzen wurde nach 12-14 Wochen der Behandlung mit 26-31 mg/kg Terbinafin alle 24 Stunden per os (PO) eine klinische und mykologische Heilung erzielt. Die klinischen Symptome bei der Main Coon verschwanden nach einer Behandlungsdauer von sieben Wochen zur G\u00e4nze. Eine vier Wochen lange Therapie mit zus\u00e4tzlichen w\u00f6chentlichen B\u00e4dern mit einem 2% Chlorhexidin/2% Mikonazol Shampoo nach der Schur bewirkte eine 98% ige Reduktion der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des Mycetoms bei der Perserkatze, welches danach chirurgisch entfernt wurde. Die wiederkehrende generalisierte Dermatophytose der Perserkatze wurde mittels Pulstherapie mit 26 mg/kg Terbinafin alle 24 Stunden PO f\u00fcr eine Woche eines jeden Monats kontrolliert. Es wurden trotz intensiver Untersuchungen bei keiner der Katzen zugrunde liegende Ursachen gefunden, die f\u00fcr eine Dermatophytose pr\u00e4disponiert h\u00e4tten. Die Verabreichung von Terbinfin bewirkte bei der Perserkatze eine leichte bis moderate Lethargie, aber es wurden keine weiteren Nebenwirkungen oder Ver\u00e4nderungen bei den Blutparametern gesehen. Nach bestem Wissen des Autors handelt es sich hierbei um den ersten Bericht eines Dermatophyten Mycetoms bei einer Maine Coon Katze sowie die erfolgreiche Behandlung dieses Zustandes bei Katzen mit Terbinafin Therapie.",

L'itraconazole a \u00e9t\u00e9 stopp\u00e9 apr\u00e8s manque d'efficacit\u00e9 dans un cas (un Persan) et pour effets secondaires inacceptables pour l'autre (un Maine Coon). Les deux chats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 gu\u00e9ris cliniquement et mycologiquement apr\u00e8s 12-14 semaines avec 26-31 mg/kg de terbinafine q24h per os (PO). Les signes cliniques chez le Maine Coon ont totalement disparu apr\u00e8s sept semaines de traitement. Quatre semaines suppl\u00e9mentaires avec association de lotions hebdomadaires avec un shampooing de 2% chlorhexidine/2% miconazole apr\u00e8s tonte a permis une diminution de 98% des l\u00e9sions chez le Persan, suivi d'une ex\u00e9r\u00e8se chirurgicale. La dermatophytose g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e du Persan a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e avec une th\u00e9rapeutique puls\u00e9e de 26 mg/kg de terbinafine q24h PO une semaine par mois. aucune cause sous jacente n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e pour les deux chats malgr\u00e9 une recherche extensive. L'administration de terbinafine a provoqu\u00e9 une l\u00e9thargie mod\u00e9r\u00e9e chez le Persan, mais aucun autre effet secondaire ou modification des param\u00e8tres sanguins n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9e. A la connaissance des auteurs, il s'agit de la premi\u00e8re description de myc\u00e9tome chez un Maine Coon et du rapport de l'efficacit\u00e9 de la terbinafine dans cette indication.",
