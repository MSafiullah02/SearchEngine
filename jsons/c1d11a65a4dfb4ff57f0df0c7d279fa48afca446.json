Whole genome phylogenetic analyses indicate that these genomes are distinct lineages that are clearly highly diverged from the previously known genomes that provide the basis for the current genera. The biologies and life cycles of these viruses are also distinct from those of members of both current genera Granulovirus and Nucleopolyhedrovirus.

These proposals concerned virologists represented by several subcommittees but were presented by the Chair of the Fungus Virus Subcommittee. It was proposed to erect two orders, Retrovirales and Retrales, that would include all such elements. The order Retrovirales would contain elements that are known to have the potential for horizontal spread, and would be subdivided into three suborders. One suborder would include the retroviruses in the established family Retroviridae, another that would include elements with DNA genomes in the families Caulimoviridae and Hepadnaviridae, and a third that would include retrotransposons in the families Pseudoviridae and Metaviridae. The order Retrales would contain elements that are not known to spread from one individual to another by horizontal transfer and that do not appear to have potential for such transfer. The idea of grouping the reverse-transcribing elements that have already been accepted by the ICTV as viruses into a higher order taxon has received broad support from those who work with such elements. Potentially more problematic parts of these proposals are: 1) that the ICTV does not at this time recognize \"Suborder\" as a taxon; and 2) that all elements currently studied by ICTV have been shown to be infectious. A further problem with the Suborder taxa as proposed is that they do not appear to reflect phylogenetic groupings of these elements, as determined from reverse transcriptase alignments. The authors will be asked to remove the suborder taxa, and to remove the proposals concerning the non-transmissible order Retrales.",

The Phytophthora-infecting endornavirus was found to contain a UDP-glucosyltransferase gene. Two members of the Hypoviridae family of pathogens that infect the ascomycete fungal genus Cryphonectria were also found to contain UDP-glucosyltransferase genes that appear to be complete. The description of increasing numbers of viruses of fungi that are closely related to viruses in established families that infect other eukaryotes argues that increasing communication between fungal virus study groups will be required in the future.",

The first change arose because it was felt that it was unreasonable that the ICTV Statutes disqualified Study Group chairs from voting on proposed changes to virus taxonomy, even though they were often the ones making the proposals in the first place and the best informed on the relevant issues. All Study Group chairs are ex officio members of one of the five subcommittees of the ICTV (i.e. those for Viruses of Vertebrates, of Invertebrates, of Plants, of Fungi, Algae and Protists, and of Prokaryotes) and they make up most of the members of these subcommittees. The change passed by Virology Division at the Congress gave voting rights to all members of the 6 EC subcommittees (5 types of major host and the Virus Database Subcommittee). Because some subcommittee members would, as a result of these changes, have been qualified to vote more than once, a sentence was added to restrict this entitlement to a single vote on each taxonomic proposal. The second change that was also passed by the full ICTV membership and by the Virology Division of IUMS concerned the national membership of ICTV. National Members are appointed by member societies of Virology Division independently of the EC of ICTV. The 422 M. A. Mayo and L. A. Ball: ICTV in San Francisco change will mean that the appointing societies will be required to either renew an appointment or nominate a new National Member shortly after each International Congress of Virology. It is hoped that this mechanism will result in a more active national membership than at present.",
