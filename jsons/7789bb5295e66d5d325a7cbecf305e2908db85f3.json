A retrospective study of 1099 COVID-19 cases across 30 Chinese hospitals identified nine patients (0.8%) with documented conjunctival congestion [6] . However, ocular signs could be more prevalent than noted in retrospective reports. In COVID-19 patients who underwent dedicated ophthalmic examination, 12 of 38 (31.6%) had conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, or epiphora [5] . Patients with conjunctivitis have had SARS-CoV-2 detected in tears, suggesting infectivity [7] .
