            "text": "Influenza A viruses infecting humans are responsible for a gamut of illnesses ranging from inapparent infections to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome. The typical infection one associates with seasonal influenza is a mild, self-limited febrile syndrome. As with other respiratory viruses, influenza viruses can cause more severe infections in infants, the elderly, and immunodeficient persons. In those individuals whose immune system is compromised or not fully developed, influenza-associated disease will often lead to severe viral pneumonitis or be complicated by bacterial superinfection, leading to pneumonia and sepsis. Seasonal influenza also occasionally results in neurologic complications. Even in non-pandemic years, more than 40,000 deaths annually are attributable to influenza infections in the United States (Dushoff et al., 2006). Much more rarely, humans can become infected by viruses that have spread directly from wild birds to domestic poultry. Such \u201cavian influenza\u201d can range in severity from mild conjunctivitis through the rapidly lethal disease seen in persons infected with the recently emerged Southeast Asian H5N1 virus. However, the potential for such highly virulent, lethal viruses to spread globally, as in the 1918 \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d pandemic, has resulted in a tremendous effort to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs to block the spread of virus and to treat the disease in humans, so as to prevent death.",

Efforts have intensified in recent years to understand the pathogenesis of the various forms of influenza virus infection and to develop new treatments (Beigel and Bray, 2008). To develop effective antiviral therapies for this wide range of diseases, it is essential to have laboratory animal models that replicate the major features of illness in humans and provide selective, sensitive and reproducible results. Selecting the appropriate laboratory animal infection is very important in the drug development process. Some animals, such as pigs and ferrets, are naturally susceptible to infection by influenza viruses, but some of the other species that have been used for influenza studies are not. For the latter, the virus requires adaptation before it can replicate in the animal and/or cause disease (e.g., human seasonal influenza viruses in mice, rats). Once influenza viruses infect an animal, the virus may cause nonlethal disease or lethal disease. The type of disease that is induced can be manipulated by the investigator and is dependent on a variety of factors including virus strain, amount of virus in the inoculum, route of inoculation, time allowed for the disease to develop and the animal's immune status.",

The virus was adapted to rats by 11 successive passages thorough infected lung homogenate. The F344 and SD rats were most sensitive to the infection, with 100-fold higher lung virus titers than seen in the BN rats. Alveolar macrophages, lactate dehydrogenase activity, and total lung protein concentrations (an indicator of pulmonary edema) were higher in the BN rats. Neutrophil numbers, interleukin 6 levels, and TNF-\u03b1 activity were greatest in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from F344 and SD rats. Nevertheless, the infection was not lethal and few pathologic abnormalities were noted in the lungs. Although the study provided insights into factors of importance in protecting the host from influenza virus infections, rat models probably have not been characterized well enough to be recommended for use in evaluating anti-influenza therapies.",

The infections were mild, without pneumonia or significant lung pathology.

The laboratory mouse can be experimentally infected with both seasonal influenza A viruses and influenza B viruses, but this usually requires some adaptation by multiple lung passage.

Disease manifestations often depend on the infectivity and challenge dose of the virus and (for seasonal influenza virus strains) how well the virus has adapted to the host. If a virus replicates in mice without causing apparent illness, the effects of therapy can be monitored using parameters such as lung viral titers, increase in lung weight and increase in 1-acid glycoprotein (1-AG), all of which increase in nonlethally infected mice (Ottolini et al., 2005, Sidwell and Smee, 2000).",

However, as in humans, reduced blood oxygen saturation levels, a measure of lung function, can be measured in mice, and these levels are dramatically lower as pneumonia progresses and the mice approach death (Barnard et al., 2007). Weight loss is also a good marker of disease severity (Sidwell and Smee, 2000).

However, this issue will probably be resolved in the near future with the development of reagents such as cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAb). For example, CD8+ cells in mouse bronchoalveolar lavages from pneumonic ferrets were identified with mAb to human CD8 (Rutigliano et al., 2008). Caging can also be a problem, because most animal facilities require that 1\u20133 ferrets be housed in rabbit-style cage systems. Proper caging for work with H5N1 influenza virus is at the final stages of development, but not yet available for use. Access to specific pathogen-free (influenza virus seronegative) ferrets is also an issue, and will become increasingly so as the demand for ferret studies grows. Finally, although ferrets are relatively passive in temperament relative to their mink cousins, they can become fairly aggressive after being exposed to invasive procedures.",

Fatal meningococcal pneumonia and bacteremia were observed in influenza-infected mice superinfected with bacteria on day 7, but not on day 10. Thus, the investigators were able to model human meningococcemia with fatal sepsis, and were also able to examine the role of various bacterial virulence factors leading to sepsis.",

The goals of the study were to better understand the various sequelae of S. pneumoniae infection, including otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia, and to determine if the frequency and character of secondary pneumococcal infections differed depending on the strain of influenza virus that preceded bacterial challenge, as has been reported in humans. The viruses studied were A/Taiwan/1/86 (H1N1), the H3N2 viruses A/Sydney/5/97 and A/Fujian/411/02, and influenza B virus B/Singapore/222/79. In seven-week-old ferrets inoculated intranasally with virus and 5 days later with S. pneumoniae, all viruses increased bacterial colonization of the nasopharynx. However, 9 of 10 ferrets infected with H3N2 subtype influenza A viruses developed either sinusitis or otitis media, while only 1 of 11 infected with an H1N1 virus or an influenza B virus did so. These data support observations in humans that bacterial complication rates are higher during seasons when H3N2 viruses predominate (Bhat et al., 2005). This animal model could be useful for further study of the mechanisms that underlie viral\u2013bacterial disease synergism.",

In addition, all three influenza pandemics of the 20th century included cases of co-infection with S. aureus in healthier and younger patients (Braun et al., 2007). Therefore, physiologic and pathologic changes in cotton rats infected with both S. aureus and influenza A/Wuhan/359/95 (H3N2) was evaluated and compared to the infections in cotton rats with each agent alone. Peribronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonitis as well as alveolitis were observed. Although pathology scores began to decline in the co-infected on day 7 p.i., they remained significantly higher than all other infected cohorts. This was true even in the cohort co-infected with inactivated S. aureus and influenza virus. Co-infection resulted in higher mortality than infection with either agent alone, and was associated with more marked hypothermia, lung pathology an enhancement of proinflammatory cytokine expression in the lungs (Braun et al., 2007). In addition, bacteremia was prolonged and bacterial lung titers were higher in co-infected cotton rats.",

Although the infection is primarily pulmonary, there is strong evidence of systemic spread to solid organs, including the brain (Gubareva et al., 1998a, Katz et al., 2000a). Most of these viruses cause necrosis in respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity (Hatta et al., 2007), trachea (Hatta et al., 2007), bronchi, and bronchioles (Katz et al., 2000b, Hatta and Kawaoka, 2005) with accompanying inflammation and accumulation of fibrin and neutrophils (Katz et al., 2000b). The pathology in the lungs can be characterized as a peribronchial alveolitis with intra-alveolar serofibrinous exudate, erythrocytes and neutrophils, and increased numbers of alveolar macrophages (Katz et al., 2000b). Often the infection results in a bronchointerstitial pneumonia and alveolar edema or in severe cases it may become a diffuse interstitial pneumonia affecting entire lung lobes (Dybing et al., 2000). Body temperatures usually decrease by four of five degrees and animals lose at least 20% or more body when they succumb to the effects of the infection.",

The infections generally have been characterized by severe lethargy, fever, weight loss, transient lymphopenia, and virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and in multiple organs including the brain. More importantly, the illness induced by these agents was more severe than that induced by recently isolated human H3N2 viruses. The lungs of H5N1-infected ferrets showed diffuse inflammation of interalveolar septa with infiltrates of mononuclear cells and intra-alveolar edema, regardless of the time post infection; in contrast to the scattered infiltrates seen with other influenza A viruses, these changes were observed throughout the lungs (Maines et al., 2005). Viral antigens were detected in alveolar bronchial cells or bronchioles in the majority of animals by day 3 post virus exposure.

(2008) analyzed the expression of host innate immune response genes during the course of lethal infection. The authors found that many interferon response genes, including IFI44, ISG15 (G1P2), MX2, OAS1, OAS2, STAT1, TAP1, and UBE1L, were significantly upregulated ferrets infected with the H5N1 virus, in comparison to an H3N2 isolate. CXCL10, a chemoattractant of activated Th1 lymphocytes and natural killer cells, was also upregulated to a much greater extent in an H5N1 infection than with the H3N2 virus. CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 are thought to play a role in the temporal development of innate and adaptive immunity in concert with type I and II interferons (Neville et al., 1997). In support of that hypothesis, Cameron et al. (2008) found that treatment of H5N1-infected ferrets with AMG487, a CXCR3 antagonist, markedly reduced the severity of symptoms and delayed death, compared to untreated animals.",

Within 2 days, most animals developed fever, conjunctivitis, lethargy, and labored breathing. Virus was detected in the throat, nasal, and rectum, regardless of the original site of infection. The virus spread systemically and was detected in the respiratory and digestive tracts, liver, kidney, heart, brain, and lymph nodes. Cellular damage in infected tissues correlated with the detection of viral proteins. Histopathological examination of the lungs revealed multiple or coalescing foci of inflammation and necrosis in the bronchioles. The alveolar and bronchiolar lumina were infiltrated with alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and erythrocytes, mixed with fibrin, edema fluid, and cellular debris. More importantly, some alveoli were covered by hyaline membranes, which are also seen human lungs upon autopsy. Hyaline membrane formation has not been observed in mice or other animal models. The epithelium of bronchiolar and alveolar walls, which were moderately thickened, also had evidence of both necrosis and hyperplasia. There was also edema and moderate accumulation of mononuclear cells around pulmonary artery branches. Although there has been some work in defining the cat influenza model for evaluating pathogenesis of H5N1 infections, few if any studies have been published which describe the suitability of the cat for doing vaccine (Karaca et al., 2005, Vahlenkamp et al., 2008) and antiviral efficacy studies.",

The disease in dogs was characterized by the development of conjunctivitis and fever within 2 days after virus exposure, which resolved with no other adverse events by day 7.

The principal change in the lung was a necrotizing bronchial interstitial pneumonia, similar to that described for primary human influenza pneumonia. In contrast to human H5N1 cases, detection of influenza virus antigen was limited to pulmonary tissue and tonsils. The model was used to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous zanamivir, which has a longer half-life than oseltamivir (Stittelaar et al., 2008). Drug levels in the epithelial lining fluids of the lungs were equivalent to those in plasma. Treated macaques had lower gross pathology scores and less lung pathology than untreated animals. However, there was considerable variability in viral lung titers and gross pathology within groups of macaques, and scattering of foci of lung infection from animal to animal, making it difficult to establish statistically significant differences. The authors pointed out that such variability probably reflects what happens within the human population. Some vaccine studies with macaques have also been done (de Vries et al., 2008, Kreijtz et al., 2008, Ruat et al., 2008 among others).",

After initial replication in the respiratory mucosa, the virus apparently traveled through afferent fibers of the olfactory, vagal, trigeminal, and sympathetic nerves, where it was detected by immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using intranasal installation of viruses isolated directly from patients to establish an encephalitis-like infection, an ideal way for quickly evaluating antiviral inhibitors.",

By contrast, viruses that have acquired resistance to zanamivir and oseltamivir generally display a significant reduction in infectivity in mice, compared to the parent viruses (Gubareva et al., 2000, Herlocher et al., 2004, Yen et al., 2005). This reduction in virulence has been evaluated by several means. In one study, mice were infected in parallel with equal quantities of the parental and the mutant viruses, and lungs were removed early in the infection (Gubareva et al., 1997). The virus titer in each was then determined and the titers of the challenge viruses needed to induce a 50% infection were compared or the amount of virus produced in the lungs by equivalent concentrations of the viruses was quantified (Tai et al., 1998). Alternatively, using a mouse-adapted influenza virus, the relative virulence of the mutant virus was assessed using parameters such as increased lung weight, lung pathogenesis scores, lung histopathology, and decreased SaO2% levels of the lungs (Sidwell et al., 1995).",

Host resistance models have therefore been used to evaluate the effect of an antiviral treatment on virus clearance, as an indicator of the immunocompetence of an animal during or after treatment and to test for the immunotoxicity of a particular agent (Burleson and Burleson, 2007). Mechanistic studies to detect immunotoxicity should include measuring innate, humoral and cell mediated immune responses, through parameters such as cytokine and interferon production, macrophage function, and natural killer cell function and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, as well as influenza-specific antibody during or after drug treatment. For example, the compound 3M-011, a synthetic human TLR7/8 agonist, was evaluated for antiviral efficacy and immunotoxicity in a rat HR model, which parallel human influenza infection, both with respect to time course and development of respiratory tract lesions (Hammerbeck et al., 2007, Burleson and Burleson, 2007). Intranasal (IN) administration of 3M-011 significantly inhibited H3N2 influenza viral replication in the nasal cavity when animals were pretreated or therapeutically treated with the compound. Inhibition correlated closely with induction of type I interferon and to a lesser extent with other cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3 from rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and seemed to have no negative effect on the immune response to infection.",

Animal models have been developed to evaluate the pandemic potential of influenza viruses, especially for the H5N1 agent. In one recent study, Yen et al.

Studies with antiviral agents have shown the infection in mice to be predictive of efficacy in humans. For example, all of the currently approved drugs for treating influenza virus infections were first shown to be efficacious in mice. Although mice are not readily susceptible to newly isolated human seasonal influenza viruses and require virus adaptation, many highly pathogenic avian influenza strains require no adaptation and readily infect mice to cause lethal disease. Mice also do not exhibit some of the clinical symptoms detected in humans such as nasal exudate, fever, sneezing, and coughing. However, many clinical signs that seem to markers of disease severity can be measured in mice to study influenza disease, such as saturated oxygen levels, virus lung titers, cytokine levels, serum and acute phase proteins. In addition, the use of mouse models enable the investigator to rapidly evaluate the efficacy of antiviral agents and vaccines at relatively lesser costs than other animal models.",

However, the recent emergence of the highly virulent H5N1 avian influenza virus in Southeast Asia has served as a wake-up call, reminding the medical community that novel influenza A viruses can unexpectedly enter the human population and that even the currently circulating seasonal strains are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Influenza A viruses, far from being benign respiratory pathogens, are a major public health problem that calls for a serious and sustained research response. An essential part of that process is the development of laboratory animal models of influenza virus infection for the study of pathogenesis and the evaluation of new drugs and vaccines. As described in this paper, a number of animal models have been developed, but many gaps remain. Many of the current models remain incompletely characterized, and none has been employed to its full potential. New and better models are needed to provide more accurate answers to critical questions in pathogenesis and therapy. It is hoped that this paper will contribute to the better use of laboratory animal models to combat the continuing threat of influenza.",
