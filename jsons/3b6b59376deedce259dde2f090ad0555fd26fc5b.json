In this narrative review, the authors discuss these medications from a mechanistic perspective with specific insights into their potential role in controlling viral infections. We discuss in vitro and in vivo evidence for their emerging therapeutic role in COVID-19 with due concerns to safety when applying the known facts to large populations increasingly affected with COVID-19.",

            "text": "HCQ is known to have significant effects on many mechanisms that drive the viral entry into the host cells. Most prominent among them are its actions on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) II receptors. The original experiments during the SARS epidemic suggested that SARS-CoV-1 binds to ACE II receptors, primarily present in the lung, heart, kidney, and intestine for its entry into the host system. More specifically, SARS-CoV-1 binds to the sialic acid moiety of the ACE II receptors. 15, 16 Chloroquine inhibits the intracellular glycosylation of the ACE II, and thus inhibits the addition of sialic acid moiety, which then leads to reduced ligand recognition and internalization of the virus. 17 Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 has shown about 80% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-1, 18 prompting the evaluation of these drug compounds for COVID-19. Once the virus is bound to the cell membrane, endosomes play an important role in the fusion of viral particles and their internalization. Thus, neutralization of the acidic pH of the endosome by chloroquine or HCQ may prevent the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with the host cell inhibiting the primary entry. 19 An alternate mechanism hypothesized to inhibit the uptake of the virus into the host cell is based on the ability of chloroquine to be a broad inhibitor of nanoparticle endocytosis by resident macrophages. 20 At the concentrations achieved in routine clinical dosing, chloroquine reduces in vitro and in vivo accumulation of synthetic nanoparticles. 21, 22 It also reduces the expression of phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein, 22 required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of nano-sized structures. The ultrastructural studies of SARS-CoV-2 show that these virions fall within the same size (60-140 nm) and shape (spherical) range 18 as the commonly studied synthetic nanoparticles. 23, 24 Thus, these actions against SARS-CoV-2 may be applicable at early stages before viral replication, 20 which requires further experimental confirmation. Alternatively, these compounds may act at later stages by inhibiting specific enzymes needed for assembly of virion and budding of the virions from the cell membrane. These drugs may accomplish these goals without disruption of the viral particle and liberation of viral nucleic acid and enzymes that are necessary for viral replication from a lysosome. 25, 26 Finally, these compounds have been shown to have a profound effect on the inflammatory cascade. SARS-CoV, through its ACE II receptor attachment, infects the type 2 pneumocytes in the alveolar epithelium. This results in a local inflammatory reaction with resident neutrophils and macrophage activation as well as activation of the cellular immunity arm with T helper 1 (Th1)type response. The resultant cytokine storm and alteration in epithelial permeability lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and associated morbidity and mortality related to COVID-19. 5 Chloroquine/HCQ reduces the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines, in particular the Th1 cytokines, namely interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3), 27 by the alveolar macrophages, and thus may have a role in reducing the peak inflammatory response in COVID-19. These antiviral effects Proposed mechanisms for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine Inhibition of nanoparticle uptake TNF alpha IFN gamma combined with immunomodulatory properties are promising, and thus over the last 3 months, multiple studies have been launched to leverage these benefits in the clinical setting.",

Led by its putative effects on the endosomal function disruption in one of the earliest in vitro studies, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) studied the effects of chloroquine in primate Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney cells). The investigators found that chloroquine was effective against SARS-CoV-1, and the inhibitory effects were equally potent whether the primate cells were treated before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic applications. They further showed that addition of ammonium chloride to raise the endosomal pH also had a similar inhibitory effect on the viral replication, suggesting that these effects, that is, inhibition of cellular entry as well as postentry viral replication and assembly may be affected by the alterations in the pH of the intracellular organelles. 17 In line with the findings from the CDC study, an investigative team in Wuhan, China, performed a similar in vitro time-ofaddition assay involving Vero E6 cells for SARS-Cov-2. In a physiology-based pharmacokinetic model, chloroquine/ HCQ concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under five different dosing regimens to explore the most potent and safe regimen. For 'entry' treatment, the drugs were added to the cells for 1 hour before viral attachment. For the 'post-entry' experiment, drugs were added at 2 hours post infection and maintained until the end of the experiment. Virus yield in the infected cell supernatants was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Similar to the CDC experiments, the investigators found that these molecules affected the control of virus at both entry and at post-entry stages. 28 The investigators further found that among the two, HCQ was more potent than chloroquine as the effective concentration for a half-maximal response (EC 50 ) was much lower (0.72 \u03bcM) for HCQ than for chloroquine (5.47 \u03bcM). Based on these experiments, the investigators suggested to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection with a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of HCQ sulfate to be given orally on day 1, followed by 200 mg given twice daily for 4 more days. In another study from China, 29 the investigators found the EC 90 value of chloroquine against the SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells was 6.90 \u03bcM. The investigators recommended that these concentrations, as evidenced through the pharmacokinetic studies for these molecules performed in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received chloroquine at 500 mg per day dose, were clinically achievable. 30",

            "text": "In one of the first published pieces of evidence (published as a letter), Gao and colleagues from China drew attention to the potential role of chloroquine for treating COVID-19. Based on the clinical data collected from ten hospitals in China (Wuhan, Jingzhou, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Ningbo) involving >100 patients, the authors proposed that chloroquine was a promising therapeutic drug. They reported that the patients who received chloroquine phosphate had lower rates of pneumonia exacerbation, greater improvement in lung imaging findings, higher rates of conversion to the virus-negative state, and shorter disease course compared to those who did not receive the drug. 31 Unfortunately, the report did not publish specific details about the patient population, response pattern, or analysis of outcomes. were either treated at a nearby facility without HCQ or who refused participation. Twenty-six patients received HCQ (200 mg three times daily for 10 days) of which six received it in conjunction with azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for 4 days). The inclusion of azithromycin was rationalized on the basis of its in vitro activity against Zika and Ebola viruses 33,34 and on the clinical evidence for its ability to prevent severe respiratory tract infections in patients suffering from viral infection. 35 The primary outcome for the study was the virological clearance from nasopharyngeal secretions at day 6 after receiving the drug. The investigators found that patients treated with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin had significantly greater virological clearance (p=0.001) at day 6 (57.1 and 100%, respectively), compared to those in the control group (12.5%). Although encouraging, this ongoing study, as published, had several ISSN: 1740-4398 REVIEW -Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and COVID-19 drugsincontext.com concerns to allow for strong recommendations in favor of or against HCQ. Six of the 26 patients in the treatment group were lost to follow-up and were not included in the analysis, with three transferred to intensive care unit (ICU), one death, and two withdrawals, limiting the interpretation of the data. Furthermore, the criteria for the selection of patients receiving additional azithromycin were not specified. Finally, the study had a very low proportion of patients with lower respiratory tract pathology, and outcomes of the clinical parameters including effects on hemodynamic stability, ventilator parameters, length of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality have not been published. Nonetheless, early strong indications for the efficacy of this paper prompted another group in France to prospectively study 11 consecutive COVID-19 patients with high comorbidity burden (in 8 out of 11) admitted under their care to be treated with the combination regimen of HCQ and azithromycin, in doses similar to those used in the Marseille study. Serious adverse events (one death, two transfers to the ICU, and one drug discontinuation due to prolongation of QTc interval) were reported in 4 out of 11 patients, and 8 out of the remaining 10 had persistently positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR after 5-6 days of therapy, prompting investigators to conclude that there is no evidence of rapid clearance with this therapy. 36 Findings from two additional randomized control studies recently became available for review. In the first one, investigators from Wuhan, China (Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University), 37 evaluated the effects of a 5-day course of HCQ (200 mg twice-a-day regimen) in addition to a 'standard treatment' comprising oxygen therapy, antibiotics, and immunoglobulin, with or without corticosteroids compared with 'standard treatment' alone. The study utilized clinical measures, such as the return of body temperature and 38 did not find similar benefits with HCQ. In this study, 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were randomized to either receive conventional treatment only or conventional treatment with the addition of HCQ (400 mg daily for 5 days). The investigators found that the viral clearance, as judged by the detection of the viral nucleic acid in the pharyngeal swab on day 7 after treatment initiation, was not different for the two groups. They also found that the difference in the median time to achieve afebrile status and in the radiological findings of pneumonia was not different for the two groups.",

HCQ is the structural analog of the chloroquine molecule with the addition of a \u03b2-hydroxyl moiety at one end. Although this imparts HCQ a comparable clinical efficacy, it has been noticed to do so by providing a better safety profile. 1 In modern medicine, HCQ is a more commonly used formulation for most non-malarial indications. Both these agents are cheap, safe, and well tolerated by most patient populations, including pregnant women and those with chronic diseases or immunocompromised status. They are administered orally and have a near-complete absorption from the gastrointestinal tract with about 75% bioavailability. 39 Peak drug concentrations are achieved in about 4-12 hours after oral administration and are excreted principally through the kidneys, the process facilitated by acidification of the urine. Small quantities are also excreted through the bile, sweat, and saliva. They are widely distributed throughout the body, including the lung, 40 and have a large volume of distribution with significant intracellular sequestration, allowing them to have a long functional half-life (40-50 days) and achieve stable plasma levels usually after 4-6 weeks of regular daily dosing. 27 Unfortunately, these kinetics have been studied with chronic use of chloroquine/HCQ, and its applicability, especially in short courses, concerning alveolar concentration is not known.",

While the risk of retinopathy is a major limiting factor for chronic use at higher doses, this is likely to be less of a concern with acute short-term doses recommended for COVID-19, especially for HCQ that has a faster clearance from retinal pigment cells, compared to chloroquine. 41 Another concern particularly relevant to the current pandemic is the possibility of myocardial toxicity, QTc interval prolongation, and the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias. Several anecdotal reports and cohorts have raised concerns for chloroquine/HCQ -induced cardiomyopathy. 42 However, a detailed review of the data suggests that these concerns are significant largely in patients prescribed high doses of these agents. 43 Recent reports have also suggested that COVID-19 itself may cause myocardial injury, which in and of itself is associated with the higher incidence of adverse outcomes. 44 It is noteworthy that the risk of adverse outcomes, and hence the need for therapy, is higher in the elderly COVID-19 population with multiple chronic diseases, the exact population at higher chances of having comorbidities or medications causing QTc prolongation. In this regard though, retrospective analyses of the rheumatological cohorts have shown that the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is lower in patients on therapy with these agents compared to those not on treatment. 45 Although reassuring, these mutually contradictory data demand additional caution, as the doses of HCQ recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 are higher than those used conventionally for chronic low-dose therapy, and their interplay with direct toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Thus, especially for the high-risk population with significant comorbidity burden, it may be prudent to obtain a routine electrocardiogram prior to initiating HCQ therapy. As azithromycin is also known to prolong the QTc interval, patients with prolonged QTc (i.e. \u2265450-500 msec) may be better served by avoiding a combination regimen or with ongoing telemetry monitoring for the occurrence of arrhythmias.",
