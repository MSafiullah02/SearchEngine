Firstly because that is the suspected method of transmission in most cases of covid-19 and also because there is evidence to suggest that inoculation with a high initial viral load (such as might occur when a patient coughs directly into the face of a physician at close range, for example during intubation) may result in a more severe pattern of infection for that individual. 2, 3 This has led to some centres suggesting alternative methods of management and with regard to fracture fixation of the tooth bearing portion of the facial skeleton, there is an argument that mandibular-maxillary fixation (MMF) under local anaesthetic be used as an alternative to the gold standard of open reduction and internal fixation due to aerosol generation caused both by the necessity for intubation and by water cooling of the drill, however experience teaches us that in * Corresponding author. many cases MMF is difficult in terms of patient compliance and can result in adverse outcomes.",

Given the significant (25-67%) chance of self contamination when doffing PPE this is most certainly advantageous. 4 This technique has been used to successfully manage all trauma cases requiring ORIF during the COVID-19 related restricted clinical activity in our supra regional centre.",
