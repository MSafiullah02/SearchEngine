            "text": "The historical development of the cell death concept has been thoroughly reviewed by Majno and Joris [1]. Interestingly, it was already the German pathologist Rudolf Virchow at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin who discussed the fact that cells can perish in his Lecture XV published in Cellularpathologie (Cellular Pathology) under the Chapter \u201cPassive Vorg\u00e4nge. Fettige Degeneration, Seite 285\u201d (passive processes and degenerations) [2]. Topics related to cell death are treated in this lecture held in Berlin on April 10, 1858, at a gross level, under chapters such as \u201cDie passiven Vorg\u00e4nge in ihren beiden Hauptrichtungen zur Degeneration: Nekrobiose (Erweichung und Zerfall).\u201d (The passive processes in their two main directions to degeneration: necrobiosis (softening and decay). Virchow uses the term necrosis to mean an advanced stage of tissue degradation, similar to what is medically now called gangrene. He wrote (p. 287): Diese letztere Categorie, wo die Elemente unter dem Ablaufe des Prozesses zu Grunde gehen, habe ich vor einigen Jahren vorgeschlagen mit einem Ausdruck zu bezeichnen, welcher von K. H. Schultz f\u00fcr die Krankheit \u00fcberhaupt gebraucht ist, mit dem der Nekrobiose. Immer n\u00e4mlich handelt es sich hier um ein Absterben, um ein Zugrundegehen, man m\u00f6chte fast sagen, um eine Nekrose. Aber der Begriff der Nekrose bietet doch gar keine Analogie mit diesen Vorg\u00e4ngen, insofern wir uns bei der Nekrose den mortificirten Theil als in seiner \u00e4usseren Form mehr oder weniger erhalten denken; Seite 287) (loosely translated: This last category where the elements perish during the process, has been proposed by me, a couple of years ago, to denote with a term that was used by K.H. Schultz for the disease specifically, that is, with that of necrobiosis. Namely, it always deals with a mortification, a decay, one would rather like to say necrosis. But the term necrosis does not offer any analogy to these processes, insofar, in necrosis, we conceive the mortified (gangrenous) part to be preserved more or less in its external form). Virchow, a few pages later in his book (p. 305), also refers to cell death in relation to fatty degeneration of cells. He wrote: Gegenw\u00e4rtig nennen wir das Ding eine K\u00f6rnchenkugel, und betrachten es als das erste Stadium der Degeneration, wo nicht mehr die Zelle als Zelle erhalten ist, sondern wo bloss noch die rohe Form existirt, mit vollst\u00e4ndigem Verlust der eigentlich die Zelle constituirenden Theile, d. h. der Membran und des Kernes (loosely translated: \u201cCurrently, we call the thing a granule sphere (obviously meaning a cellular lipid vacuole) and regard it as the first phase of degeneration, where the cell as a cell is not any more preserved, but where only its raw form exists associated with complete loss of those parts that constitute the cell, that is, the membrane and the nucleus\u201d).",

When\u2014as stressed in the previous chapter\u2014adaptive stress responses such as the UPR and the DDR fail to repair molecular damage and, thus, fail to restore cellular homeostasis, cells generally promote and undergo an RCD as a means to preserve the homeostasis of the whole organism (Fig. 19.1). Doubtlessly, one of the hottest topics in modern biomedicine is the research in the field of RCD. In fact, it is the intersection between cell death as a major source of DAMP emission and execution of innate/adaptive immune responses that is central not only to maintenance and restoration of homeostasis but also, unfortunately, to pathogenesis of many human diseases and\u2014as a consequential necessity\u2014to the development of novel therapeutics.

The character and the intensity of a cell\u2019s death can vary. In principle, cells may die either individually or in groups in an accidental manner, that is, in the form of an ACD or may succumb to an RCD. Accidental cell death is caused by extreme insults such as overwhelming thermal, chemical, or mechanical/physical injuries, a typical example being freezing and thawing procedures. As previously mentioned, this kind of cell death is entirely uncontrolled and virtually immediate. By contrast, RCD is caused by low or moderate insults as can be observed, for example, during various kinds of infections or pathological tissue reperfusion.",

By definition, RN is an immunogenic form of cell death because of the inevitable rupture of the plasma membrane and consequent release of large amounts of constitutive DAMPs. Such a process does not happen during apoptosis as a low degree-immunogenic form of cell death because, here, the plasma membrane integrity remains preserved. Expectedly, therefore, the emission of DAMPs by apoptotic cells is weak or even null. Importantly, several different pathways of RN have been recently described, typically associated with variable intensity of emission of inducible DAMPs. Thus, in the perspective of the book, their different mechanistic formations deserve a brief but clear description, before resuming this exciting topic of immunogenicity at the end of the chapter.\n",

As a Greek term, apoptosis translates to the \u201cfalling off\u201d of dead leaves from a tree [13]. As also reviewed [1], spontaneous apoptotic cell death as a physiological event was discussed almost as soon as stains became available. And it was the German biologist Walther Flemming, a founder of cytogenetics, who first observed the phenomenon under the microscope and called the process chromatolysis [14]. In 1914, the German anatomist Ludwig Gr\u00e4per interpreted Flemming\u2019s observations by claiming that \u201cchromatolysis must exist in all organs in which cells must be eliminated\u201d [15]. Many years later in 1951, Gl\u00fccksmann, a German\u2013British embryologist, in studies on cell death in embryonic tissue, published a finer description of the cell changes now known as apoptosis, such as:There is ample support for the morphological identification of dying cells from the following considerations: the degeneration \u2018granules\u2019 are initially Feulgen-positive and have thus originated from nuclear constituents; the stages of cell deaths seen in normal embryos are identical with those produced experimentally and with those observed directly in tissue cultures; degenerating cells react in the same manner to supravital stains in vivo and in vitro. The process of degeneration varies with the degree of specialization of the cell, with its functional state (e.g., mitosis), with the type of animal and under experimental conditions with the causative agents. Cell death may take from less than 1 h to about 7 h, when only a small proportion of a living tissue dies but may be prolonged to days when numerous cells die simultaneously, and their resorption is delayed [16].\n",

Alternatively, apoptosis may be activated deliberately by a variety of injurious stimuli, including certain types of severe cell stress and insults or in response to extracellular signals triggered by specific death-inducing ligands, for example, TNF. The caspases operating in apoptosis are divided into two broad categories: initiator caspases (e.g., caspase-8 and caspase-9) and executioner or effector caspases (e.g., caspase-3 and caspase-7). The initiators trigger a cascade-like proteolytic stimulation of effector caspase zymogens.

For example, the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins BAX and BAK. On the other hand, the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins are themselves inhibited by the BH3-only proteins in response to an intrinsic signal. This results in BAX and BAK homo-oligomerization that creates mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation (MMP) associated with formation of membrane pores, releasing mitochondrial cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. Following, cytochrome C triggers a conformational change in apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), resulting in ATP exchange and oligomerization to form a complex, called the \u201capoptosome\u201d that converts pro-caspase-9 to active caspase-9. Caspase-9 then activates the executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7, leading to cell death. Caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 are kept in check by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP); however, BAX and BAK also release from mitochondria a protein called second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC, also known as DIABLO) and cytochrome C. The protein SMAC/DIABLO sequesters XIAP, thereby facilitating effector caspase activation (for the original articles, see [25\u201327]).",

The enzyme RIPK3 is a homologous kinase of RIPK1 with a similar N-terminal kinase domain and an intermediate domain that can contribute to TNF-induced activation of NF-\u03baB, if overexpressed. RIPK3 also contains an RHIM domain at its C-terminus but lacks the C-terminal death domain compared to RIPK1. RIPK3 kinase activity appears to be essential for necroptosis. The pseudokinase MLKL is another critical mediator of necroptosis and is regarded as the sole and central effector of necroptosis.

            "text": "Importantly, upon deubiquitination of RIPK1, pro-caspase-8 may be recruited to this complex via a DD that binds the DD of FADD. This results in the forced proximity of pro-caspase-8 and activation by proteolytic cleavage of the caspases to form a functional caspase-8 homodimer capable of cleaving effector caspases, such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7, to mediate and execute apoptosis [64]. On the other hand, de-ubiquitylation and particular dephosphorylation may lead to dissociation of RIPK1, allowing it to form the cytosolic pro-cell death complex II. Two types of complex II can be distinguished (IIa and IIb) depending on the composition of complex II and the activity of the proteins therein. Importantly, while complex IIa and IIb induce apoptosis, they can also induce necroptosis if caspase-8 is inactive or absent. In case caspase-8 is inactive or absent, RIPK1 in complex II recruits and activates RIPK3 resulting in the formation of the necrosome. The necrosome formed from complex IIa consists of TRADD, RIPK1, RIPK3, and FADD, while the necrosome resulting from complex IIb lacks TRADD (Fig. 19.4) (reviewed in [65\u201373]). The enzyme RIPK3 in the necrosome is present in a phosphorylated manner, and it is not entirely clear to which extent RIPK1 or RIPK3 itself mediates this phosphorylation. However, the necrosome is stabilized by HSP90 and CDC-37, two chaperones that are required for the fully active necrosome activity [74, 75]. As a constitutive binding partner of RIPK3, MLKL is incorporated in the necrosome. Taken together, and as competently argued by Grootjans et al. [7], \u201ca working model on the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 emerges where inactive RIPK1 initially exists in a closed conformation at the TNFR1, where its DD and RHIM are unavailable for the formation of pro-cell death complexes. De-ubiquitylation and particular dephosphorylation may open up RIPK1, allowing it to form a cytosolic complex II. Activation of RIPK1 by a still to be discovered mechanism then results in its autophosphorylation and activation. Depending on the availability of caspase-8, activation of RIPK1 then allows either activation of caspase-8 or RIPK3 within complex II, which results in, respectively, apoptosis or necroptosis.\u201d",

In other words: these recent findings show that viruses such as murine CMV and IAV infections drive DAI association with RIPK3, leading to its activation and necroptosis [81] (Fig. 19.5).

The direct necrosome formation involves the canonical pathway that requires RIPK1 kinase activity and the non-canonical pathway that is dependent on the TRIF adaptor or the cytosolic DNA sensor DAI. In the indirect way, stimuli elicit the production of TNF which on its turn activates the canonical pathway. These stimuli include the activation of death receptors, stimulation of TLRs such as TLR4 or TLR3, and the RNA receptor RIG-I (as highlighted in [7]). For example, in fibroblasts and ECs, TLR3 stimulation was found to result in RIPK3- and MLKL-dependent necroptosis which can proceed independently of RIPK1 kinase activity but requires the adapter protein TRIF [82] (for TRIF, see also Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22). In other words, the emission of DAMPs during a first round of cell injury may lead to necroptosis which is associated with another round of DAMP emission serving as stimuli for PRMs. It should be allowed here to discuss whether this scenario may contribute to clinical manifestations such as chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.",

Once pMLKL is fully active, it reportedly oligomerizes and binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) located in the plasma membrane. This molecule is a multifunctional lipid that regulates several essential subcellular processes in eukaryotic cells [86, 87]. It has been proposed that pMLKL forms pores in the plasma membrane to mediate plasma membrane rupture [87], but this remains to be demonstrated in cells or in vivo.",

Activation of MLKL results in the generation of broken, membrane \u201cbubbles\u201d with exposed PS that are released from the surface of the otherwise intact cell. A distinct machinery, the so-called endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery, is needed for the formation of these bubbles and acts to sustain survival of the cell when MLKL activation is limited or reversed. Under conditions of necroptotic cell death, ESCRT-III controls the duration of plasma membrane integrity [89]. In other words, the ESCRT-III-mediated plasma membrane repair provides an extension of the time to death during necroptosis. As a consequence of this action of ESCRT-III, cells undergoing necroptosis can express regulatory immunomodulatory molecules such as CXCL1, IL-33, and IL-1\u03b2 and promote antigenic cross-priming of CD8+ T cells [89\u201392] (for IL-33, see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22; for cross-priming of CD8+ T cells, see Part VIII, Sects. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_31 and 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_32).",

Oxidation of lipids can occur via three distinct mechanisms: (1) enzymatic oxidation by enzymes such as lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases and cytochrome P450, (2) non-enzymatic, ROS-mediated oxidation, and (3) non-enzymatic, non-free radical oxidation. Each oxidation mechanism leads to generation of specific products with high stereospecificity (for reviews, see [102\u2013106]). Major products of lipoxygenase oxidation of PUFAs depend on their substrate and refer to various oxidized molecules including leukotrienes, lipoxins, and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HpETEs). Oxygenation by cyclooxygenases results in the generation of prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes, whereas cytochrome P450 generates epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), thromboxanes, and prostacyclins (reviewed in [107, 108]). Non-enzymatic mechanisms are mediated by ROS that are generated by ROS-producing enzyme systems such as NADPH oxidases and nitric oxide synthases in the presence of transition metal ions (Fe2+ and Cu2+) and result in a mixture of non-specific stereoisomers (reviewed in [106, 108]). Moreover, the enzyme myeloperoxidase has also been shown to instigate non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation through the generation of ROS (discussed in [106, 109]). Notably, by contrast to products of enzymatic lipid oxidation, the products of directly ROS-mediated non-enzymatic processes are regarded to be more toxic and harmful to the host [110].",

            "text": "The ferroptosis pathway has been recently reviewed in detail [8, 117] and may be best explained by firstly pointing toward homeostatic conditions concerned. Thus, under normal circumstances, free highly reactive intracellular iron is dangerous and therefore bound to ferritin [118, 119], thereby controlling the oxidative capacity of free iron and the amount of oxygen radicals. For example, heavy chain ferritin was demonstrated to be protective in models of IRI [120], and the role of iron in AKI has been well established [121]. When the term ferroptosis was first ascribed to the process of iron-catalyzed RN, iron chelation (a type of bonding of ions and molecules to iron ions) was demonstrated to prevent this deadly signal [122]. Also, under homeostatic conditions, the enzyme phospholipid-hydroxyperoxid-glutathione-peroxidase (GPX4 or PHGPx), a selenoprotein, plays an essential role in avoiding iron-dependent lipid peroxidation which is mediated by a unique enzyme, the arachidonate lipoxygenase (ALOX). In fact, constitutive ALOX activation is antagonized by GPX4 which employs glutathione (GSH) to reduce H2O2 to GSSG (oxidized glutathione) and H2O. Of note, besides recycling by the glutathione reductase, intracellular concentrations of GSH are maintained by the activity of the GSH synthase which requires the substrates glutamine, cysteine, and glycine to function. A glutamate/cystine \u201cantiporter\u201d (i.e., a co-transporter involved in secondary active transport of molecules or ions across a membrane) in the plasma membrane referred to as \u201csystem XC-minus\u201d provides the cells with cystine (Cys\u2013Cys disulfide, Cys2). This amino acid is then intracellularly metabolized to cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid for GSH synthesis [123]. Together, these observations show that GPX4\u2014indirectly\u2014inhibits lipid peroxidation and, thus, ferroptosis. On the other hand, the loss or inducible depletion of GPX4 was found to result in lethality, for example, in early embryonic lethality, or in death of neurons or renal tubular cells later during life [100, 124\u2013128]. It is worth noting here that, under normal conditions, production of ROS as generated in the course of cellular metabolism is kept in check by antioxidative mechanisms operating in the course of the oxidative stress response (see above, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_18).",

The compound erastin compromises the activity of system XC-minus by shifting the balance to less GSH production, less redox capacity of GPX4, and more lipid peroxidation and therefore is one of the FINs. Alternatively, ferroptosis can be experimentally induced by the direct GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 and several other ferroptosis-inducing agents [129, 133]. Importantly, as a characteristic sign of RCD pathways, ferroptosis was shown to be extensively metabolically regulated [134], and several proteins involved in ferroptosis have been detected in a human haploid-cell screen [135], though their exact role in the pathway is still elusive. More clearly, in a genetic approach, the deletion of the GPX4 gene locus was found to result in lethality [124, 125, 128], and the conditional deletion of GPX4 from renal tubular cells reportedly resulted in tubular cell ferroptosis within 48 h following the inducible gene knockout.",

This has led to the development of ferrostatins that were found to be the most potent small molecules for the prevention of IRI by a single compound [131, 136]. No other compounds yielded a comparable level of protection from isolated renal tubules or in vivo in kidney and liver models. Originally found in a screen for inhibitors of erastin-induced ferroptosis in HT1080 cells (a fibrosarcoma cell line), ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) was identified [122] that basically acts as a lipid antioxidant. Fer-1 is the most commonly used compound to study ferroptosis in cells and thought to be as efficient as Nec-1, which also functions as an effective inhibitor of ferroptosis [100]. Moreover, the plasma half-life and the absorption in liver liposomes along with the plasma stability are far from optimal, and the statistically significant effects seen in in vivo models [131, 137] most likely underestimate the therapeutic preclinical potential of ferrostatins. Another inhibitor, the compound 11\u201392, was much more efficient than Fer-1 in preventing tubular necrosis [138], and another inhibitor, the compound 16\u201386, was shown to convey strong effects in preclinical models of AKI. Further compounds are currently under development such as liproxstatin-1 that was developed and investigated in a model of liver IRI with substantial beneficial effects [100]. Future studies will undoubtedly lead to the development of safer and more efficient agents.",

Ferroptosis is activated explicitly by failing or dysfunctioning GPX4 activity but probably also by GPX4-independent mechanisms such as failure of the oxidative stress response in case of excessive ROS production. For the future, it will be interesting to know whether ferroptosis involves the release of large amounts of specific DAMPs (what can be expected) and, if so, whether these are unique to ferroptosis or common across different forms of RN. Notably, induction of ferroptosis is increasingly recognized as a critical form of cell death that may contribute to acute and chronic human diseases, such as IRI following myocardial infarction or cerebral stroke, major neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation, that is, disorders associated with significant cell death. Plausibly, this new knowledge has motivated researchers and the pharmaceutical industry to search for safe and effective compounds able to inhibit this form of RN. Doubtlessly, new developments in this field of modern therapeutic modalities will be soon published.",

Activation of inflammasome-associated inflammatory caspases promotes cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 to form mature cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. In parallel, these caspases drive cleavage of the pro-pyroptotic factor GSDMD by generating an N-terminal fragment that oligomerizes to form pores on the host cell membrane and cause the lytic demise of the cell. The pyroptotic cell death leads to the release of the IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 inflammatory hallmarks associated with inflammasome activation.

In fact, evidence suggests that, under homeostatic conditions, the GSDMD C-terminus has an autoinhibitory effect on the intrinsic activity of the pyroptosis-inducing GSDMD N-terminus. This cytotoxic N-terminal fragment is then released and targets/binds to phospholipids (phosphoinositide and cardiolipin) on the host plasma cell membrane [151]. Importantly, before its migration to the membrane, GSDMD N-terminus transits from a monomer to an oligomer molecule that is initiated by caspase-mediated removal of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain. Oligomerized GSDMD N-terminus leads to its insertion into the membrane resulting in the GSDMD pore formation. The pores mostly have an inner diameter of 12\u201314 nm with approximately 16 symmetric protomers. Processed GSDMD N-terminus, via its affinity for cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine, may also target and kill intracellular bacteria. GSDMD N-terminus pore formation in the host cell leads to pyroptosis to produce apoptotic body-like cell protrusions (\u201cblebbing\u201d) followed by rapid rupture of the plasma membrane. Notably, the precise mechanism of plasma membrane blebbing and rupture is currently unknown. Importantly, current notion hold that IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, formerly believed to be actively secreted, are released from the cell upon this membrane rupture, probably through those pores (reviewed in [143\u2013146, 151, 152]).",

This form of RCD generally manifests with necrotic morphological features. \u201cParthanatos\u201d is a portmanteau term (parthanatos) derived from par (for poly (ADP-ribose [PAR] polymer) and Thanatos, the personification of death in Greek mythology [153, 154].

According to current notions, the MPT-RN ensures a conformational change in a multiprotein complex assembled at the juxtaposition between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, the so-called permeability transition pore complex (PTPC). The precise molecular composition of the PTPC complex is not entirely clear but is discussed to show a degree of context dependency [35, 155]. Apart from this lack of knowledge, it seems to be evident that MPT results in a rapid drop of intracellular ATP availability, driving a peculiar form of RCD.

Such cellular injuries include stimuli which can induce DNA damage directly, such as ROS (e.g., H2O2), alkylating agents (e.g., N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine), UV radiation, and ionizing radiation (for reviews, see [153, 154, 157, 158]). The enzyme PARP-1 helps in the regulation of cellular homeostasis and the preservation of genomic integrity and stability under homeostatic conditions. Corresponding to its function in maintaining nuclear homeostasis, PARP-1 constitutes a DNA base-excision repair system by sensing injury-induced DNA strand nicks and breaks and facilitating their repair through the synthesis of PAR polymer. When there is mild or moderate DNA damage, the activity of PARP-1 increases up to 500-fold, and the enzyme makes use of oxidized NAD (NAD+), produced through the expenditure of ATP, to synthesize PAR polymer [158].",

The PAR polymer is now recognized as an essential signalling molecule in the parthanatos cascade. At first, PAR polymer translocates into the cytosol, where it constitutes a death signal to the mitochondria via dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, associated with direct binding to the PAR polymer-binding site on apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). As a result, AIF is released from the mitochondria and translocates to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, it causes large-scale DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation through as-of-yet unidentified parthanatos AIF-associated nuclease (PAAN). Parthanatic cell death is the eventual outcome. Like necroptosis and ferroptosis, this parthanatic cell death involves loss of cell membrane integrity but unlike them is not accompanied by cell swelling (reviewed in [158]).",

On the other hand, parthanatos is also reportedly implicated in the pathogenesis of several human disorders, in particular, stroke and several neurodegenerative diseases, but also in those who do not directly affect the nervous system [160]. Plausibly, therapeutic opportunities and the design of pharmacological intervention have already been envisaged. Thus, for MPT-RN, pharmacological interventions targeting putative components and upstream regulators of the PTPC complex may be potential targets for drug design. For parthanatos, the event of AIF translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus may currently be considered an attractive therapeutic target for drug design. Further progress in the elucidation of the exact molecular mechanisms is expected to promote first approaches to treatment of those diseases that are known to be associated with both MPT-RN and parthanatos.",

            "text": "Characteristically, NETosis differs from apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis. Formation of NETosis is initiated in response to either infectious (e.g., bacterial, viral, fungal) or sterile (e.g., chemical) stimuli which bind to diverse neutrophil receptors including TLRs, Fc receptors, complement receptors, and cytokine receptors. Regarding defense against infectious tissue injury, NETs have been observed to trap microorganisms and exhibit bactericidal activity through the action of NET-associated components (e.g., antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil elastase) [161, 162] (for antimicrobial peptides, see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_23). This early-observed phenomenon had led to the notion that NETosis is a defense response to infection only. However, increasing evidence now suggests that this process might also occur in non-infectious, sterile inflammation [163]. Since neutrophils via PRR signalling are activated by MAMPs and/or DAMPs, it can be assumed that they are involved in NET formation. In fact, studies in support of this assumption have already been published. For example, in a murine model of IRI, the DAMPs HMGB1 and histones were found to stimulate NET formation through TLR4- and TLR9-MyD88 signalling pathways [170]. In other lines of studies, the DAMP MSU crystals were found to be potent inducers of NETosis [171]. Again different sets of studies provided evidence suggesting that TLRs could be even key regulatory factors in S. aureus-stimulated NET formation [172].",

Conventional suicidal NETosis is the best-described model that refers to a form of RN associated with final rupture of the plasma membrane. In vital NETosis, neutrophils release NETs without showing disruption of the membrane. Vital NETosis is induced within minutes by S. aureus through both complement receptors (e.g., C3R) and TLR2 ligands or by E. coli directly via TLR4 or indirectly via TLR4-activated platelets. Unexpectedly, after the release of the nucleus, these neutrophils are still able to phagocytose pathogens, and their lifespan is not affected by DNA loss [173]. Finally, another type of ROS-dependent vital NETosis has been described in which mtDNA is released instead of nDNA [174]. In these studies, viable neutrophils, following priming with GM-CSF and subsequent short-term TLR4 or complement factor 5a (C5a) receptor stimulation, were shown to generate NETs which contained mtDNA but no nDNA (for C5a and its receptor, see Part VI, Sects. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_23 and 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_23).",

Upon activation of these receptors, downstream generation of ROS by the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex at the cytoplasmic or phagosomal membrane is accepted as an early dominant step in NET formation. Under the influence of ROS, granules and the nuclear envelope rupture, followed by release of nuclear, granular, and cytoplasmic contents which finally mingle. Then, neutrophil elastase (NE) and MPO are released from a select group of neutrophil granules, called azurophilic granules, into the cytosol and migrate to the nucleus, where they promote histone degradation and chromatin decondensation, respectively. Also, ROS leads to the activation of protein-arginine deiminase 4, an enzyme that converts arginine to citrulline on histones (e.g., histone H3), thereby fostering further chromatin decondensation in the neutrophil nucleus. In fact, citrullination also termed deimination of histones is regarded as another critical step in NET formation that occurs downstream of ROS (for histone modifications, see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_42). As a consequence of these events, the nuclear membrane ruptures, and damaged chromatin is released into the cytosol where it is further decorated with granular and cytosolic proteins to form the NETs, a process that leads to final cell death. Notably, it is not completely understood how these traps are ultimately expelled into the extracellular space; disruption of the plasma membrane, however, is the prevailing view [163, 175].",

In fact, electron microscopy revealed that NET release induced by S. aureus occurs via blebbing of the nuclear envelope and vesicular exportation in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in [12, 173, 176]).

Per definition, this RCD is associated with the emission of DAMPs, in particular, nuclear DAMPs, which, when emitted in large amounts in the course of excessive NET formation, aggravates an inflammatory response and, hence, may contribute to diseases characterized by acute hyperinflammation or chronic inflammation. Thus, NETosis has been identified to be implicated in septic infections, ARDS following severe trauma, autoinflammatory, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases. Furthermore, NETs have been observed to act as a scaffold for thrombus formation [179] which is increasingly being recognized as a critical phenomenon linking inflammation with venous thrombosis. Interestingly, recent studies in a mouse model of venous thrombosis provided evidence that platelet-derived disulfide HMGB1 act as a central mediator of the sterile inflammatory process in venous thrombosis [180].",

Apoptosis can be instigated by two major cellular signalling pathways: an intrinsic pathway that is initiated inside cells by mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic factors or an extrinsic pathway that is initiated at the cell surface by death receptors that are members of the TNF receptor gene family. The intrinsic pathway is controlled by members of the Bcl-2 protein family such as the BH3-only proteins which, when activated, stimulate pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK that form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane to provide release of cytochrome C. Following, cytochrome C associates with Apaf1 to form an apoptosome that drives activation of caspase-9, which then stimulates caspase-3 and caspase-7. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway can be divided into two paths according to two groups of death receptors. The first group (Fas, TRAILR, DR4, DR5) recruits DISC followed a series of events, that is, caspase-8-mediated activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7. The second group (TNFR1, DR3, DR6) recruits the adaptor protein TRADD that links death receptor to TRAF2, RIPK1, cIAPs, and LUBAC, forming the signalling complex I.
