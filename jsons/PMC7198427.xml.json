Coronaviruses have been recognized in numerous avian hosts and in several mammals, such bats, camels, mice, cats, dogs and more recently in scaly anteaters [[2], [3], [4]]. Most of Coronaviruses are pathogenic to humans but they produce mild symptoms or asymptomatic infections. However, in the last two decades two lethal viruses have emerged within this family: the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5], and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [6]. These are characterized by severe fever (85%), non-productive cough (69%), myalgia (49%) and dyspnea (42%), with a high frequency of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) [5,7].",

            "text": "In December 2019, a new member of the Coronaviridae family associated with severe pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China [8]. Patients showed similar clinical findings to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV given by high fever, dyspnea, and chest radiographs revealing invasive multilobed lesions [9,10]. The virus was initially termed as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [8], and it is currently known as SARS-CoV-2 producing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The origin of the virus is unknown, however, a recent study showed that the virus shares 88% identity with bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses named bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, suggesting that bats are the most likely reservoir [4]. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were close to COVID-19 in about 79% and 50%, respectively. Recently, it has been discussed that the similar sequence of the virus with human proteins could be deleterious and associated with autoimmune phenomena [11,12]. Although the current situation argues for prompt vaccination strategies, it has been suggested that it would be safer to test cross-reactivity of different viral antigens with those in humans to reduce the probability of autoimmune reactions (i.e., molecular mimicry), especially in individuals with genetic background for autoimmunity [11,13].",

Therapeutic schemes with Lopinavir/Ritonavir failed to prove reduction in overall mortality [14]. A recent randomized controlled trial with Hydroxychloroquine, showed reduction in body temperature and cough remission in the intervention group compared with controls [15]. However, the small sample size and the short period of follow up, preclude conclusions about its efficacy. Other study suggested that Azithromycin plus Hydroxychloroquine may reduce viral load, nonetheless, the clinical response associated with this approach was not evaluated and remains to be defined [16]. This combination was recently associated to worse outcomes when Hydroxychloroquine was administrated at high doses (QTc elongation and higher rates of lethality) [17]. Thus, there is not an effective nor safe medication for the management of COVID-19.",

The CP is obtained using apheresis in survivors with prior infections caused by pathogens of interest in whom antibodies against the causal agent of disease are developed. The major target is to neutralize the pathogen for its eradication [19]. Given its rapid obtaining, CP has been considered as an emergency intervention in several pandemics, including the Spanish flu, SARS-CoV, West Nile virus, and more recently, Ebola virus [[20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. CP early administered after symptoms onset showed a reduction in mortality compared with placebo or no therapy in severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology like influenza and SARS-CoV, however, a similar response in Ebola disease was not observed [20,25].",

In this sense, transfusion of CP to infected patients may provide further benefits such as immunomodulation via amelioration of severe inflammatory response [27]. The latter is the case of COVID-19 in which an over-activation of the immune system may come with systemic hyper-inflammation or \u201ccytokine storm\u201d driven by IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, IL-8, TNF and CCL2. This inflammatory reaction may perpetuate pulmonary damage entailing fibrosis and reduction of pulmonary capacity [28,29]. Herein, we propose the likely beneficial mechanisms of administering CP to patients with COVID-19 and provide a summary of evidence of this strategy in the current pandemic. At the time of writing this article there were 44 clinical trials registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov, including ours (NCT04332835, NCT04332380), in which the role of CP in COVID-19 will be evaluated.",

Then, it was recognized that immune plasma not only neutralizes the pathogen, but also provides passive immunomodulatory properties that allow the recipient to control the excessive inflammatory cascade induced by several infectious agents or sepsis [26,31]. In the early 1950s, purification and concentration of immunoglobulins from healthy donors or recovered patients, provided an option to treat serious infectious diseases as well as immune conditions including primary immunodeficiencies, allergies, and autoimmune diseases [30,32,33].",

Furthermore, the use of CP in other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, reduced days of hospital stay in critically ill patients [42,50]. In relation to the use of mechanical ventilation, in Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, and avian influenza A (H5N1), administration of CP reduced the duration of invasive ventilation [47,51]. In addition, it has been described that the use of CP in SARS-CoV and avian influenza A (H5N1) decreased the viral load in the respiratory tract [46,49]. Currently, CP used in patients with COVID-19 demonstrated to reduce viral load and improve clinical condition [38,39]. However, it is necessary to conduct randomize controlled trials to confirm the usefulness of this intervention, including hospitalized patients with mild symptoms and those in ICU.",

Preparation of IVIg includes anti-idiotypic antibodies that blockade autoreactive recipient antibodies [36,65]. This reaction is critical to control autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune diseases. In this sense, a recent report in patients with COVID-19, showed that critically ill patients exhibited positivity for anti-cardiolipin IgA antibodies as well as for anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies [66]. This evidence may suggest that CP-COVID-19 may neutralize this type of autoantibodies reducing the odds of suffering from thrombotic events (i.e., antiphospholipid syndrome-like disease), especially in critically ill patients. In the same line, a recent report of a patient with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and COVID-19 successfully treated with CP may suggest that this strategy is safe and effective in autoimmune conditions [37].",

This phenomenon is used by feline coronaviruses, HIV and dengue viruses, use to take advantage of prior anti-viral humoral immune response to effectively infect host target cells [72,73]. In vitro assays with human promonocyte cell lines demonstrated that SARS-CoV ADE was primarily mediated by antibodies against spike proteins, significantly increasing the rate of apoptosis in these cells [73]. This is of major interest in regions in which coronaviruses are endemic. Vaccines development should consider this phenomenon in patients with COVID-19, and administration of CP-COVID-19 in these areas should be conducted with caution since ADE may emerge as a harmful reaction in patients with active infection [74]. If one suspects of this phenomenon following CP-COVID-19 administration, clinicians must promptly notify the health authorities and evaluate the safety according to endemic coronaviruses in the region.",

This was demonstrated in B cells, where the upregulation of FC\u03b3RIIB was associated with treatment efficacy for acute rejection after kidney transplantation [81], and was a key determinant for IVIg response in patients with Kawasaki disease [82]. It has been suggested that sialylation of this receptor is critical for inhibitory effects in immune cells [83]. However, the study of Th17 cells in autoimmune encephalomyelitis model revealed that this process is dispensable for the immunomodulatory effect of IVIg treatment [84].

In the study conducted by Sharma et al. [86], authors found that IVIg induced the production of IL-33 that subsequently expands IL-4-producing basophils. In this line, other study found that IVIg could promote the production of IL-4 and IL-13 which correlated with levels of IL-33 [87]. A Th2 cytokine-mediated downregulation of Fc\u03b3RIIa and IFN-\u03b3R2 was suggested to be the most likely mechanisms for this phenomenon.

In this context, the inhibition of this immunological pathway may help to control excessive cytokine production and prevent pulmonary damage (i.e., fibrosis). This was recently supported by the study of Blanco-Melo et al. [108] who described an up regulation of chemokines for innate immune cells in ferrets as well as in patients with COVID-19. Interestingly, results suggest that this scenario mainly occurred in the first 7 days post infection, whereas at day 14th, other cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 persisted activated [108].
