Complications such as maternal mortality and stillbirth have been reported among pregnant women with severe respiratory infections caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4] , influenza A virus subtype H1N1 [5, 6] , and other viruses causing pneumonia [7] . Uncomplicated pregnancies lead to physiologic changes resulting in altered pulmonary and immunologic function [8, 9] , including a 20% increase in maternal oxygen consumption, a 10%-25% decrease in functional residual capacity, and significantly increased forced vital capacity after 14-16 weeks gestation. Severe respiratory illness during pregnancy may further disrupt maternal tolerance to hypoxemia and reduce oxygen flow to the fetus. Of 12 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV in South China during 1 January-31 July 2003, spontaneous miscarriages were reported from over half (59%) of those infected during their first trimesters [10] . Premature deliveries, thought to be related to poor fetal oxygenation, were experienced among 80% of those women during their second to third trimesters and were associated with intrauterine growth restriction.",

All interviewers demonstrated an understanding of cultural sensitivities and spoke Arabic. A limitation of our report is that confirmation from seroepidemiologic evidence is difficult with any retrospective investigation, and associations between serologic evidence and a particular outcome can appear spurious. Indeed, the fetal loss rate from nonchromosomal and nonstructural causes at 20 weeks gestation is estimated to be 0.5% (95% confidence interval, .3%-.8%) [13] in developed countries, and other biological explanations for our observations are possible. Nonetheless, no other MERS-CoV infections were confirmed in Jordan around this brief outbreak period despite hundreds of specimens being tested via active surveillance [14] . On the basis of the exclusivity of the timing of the pregnant subject's unprotected MERS-CoV exposure history, concurrent respiratory illness and stillbirth, and positive results of subsequent MERS-CoV serologic tests, we describe a possible association between MERS-CoV infection and stillbirth.",

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where the majority of MERS-CoV cases have occurred, included pregnant women in its 2013 recommendation of groups that should \"postpone the performance of Umrah and Hajj [in 2013]\" [15] . Neither the CDC nor the WHO has issued evaluation or management strategy recommendations specifically for MERS-CoV infection among pregnant women. As indicated by our investigation, MERS-CoV infections could potentially remain undetected among pregnant women because of barriers to receiving appropriate diagnostic care. Future prospective investigations of MERS-CoV should ascertain pregnancy status, and further pregnancy-related data should be obtained, including results of confirmatory testing of biological specimens.",
