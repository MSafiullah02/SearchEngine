However, it can be used to answer certain epidemiological questions, especially those related to the clinical status of the animal and its infectivity after treatment (Alvar et al., 1994, Gradoni, 2002). Using serial xenodiagnosis to assess the infectivity of dogs naturally infected with L. infantum, Travi et al. (2001) showed that asymptomatic individuals were unable to infect L. longipalpis females, while oligosymptomatic animals were infective at very low rates. On the other hand, symptomatic animals were able to infect large numbers of females at a very high intensity. These authors also showed the skin of the ear to be more heavily parasitised than that of the abdomen. Courtenay et al.

In fact, given that polyclonal B lymphocyte activation occurs in L. infantum infection, the presence of both immunoglobulin subclasses is to be expected. Other authors have also described IgG2 predominance (Deplazes et al., 1995, Vercammen et al., 2002). The lack of association between clinical signs in affected dogs and IgG1 levels has been observed by others, as has a positive correlation with IgG2 levels (Vercammen et al., 2002).

These differences may be attributed to the fact that these authors used Phlebotomus perniciosus females in their studies. On the other hand, differences in infection rates when sandflies were fed on oligosymptomatic and symptomatic dogs have been found by others (Travi et al., 2001, Travi et al., 2002), although asymptomatic dogs from these experiments were not able to infect the insects. Although Travi et al., 2001, Travi et al., 2002 employed L. longipalpis in their experiments, the absence of infection in this clinical category can be explained by the fact that a different feeding method was used with sandflies being fed directly on the blood of asymptomatic dogs. This method proved to be less efficient, since the same authors obtained positive results by xenodiagnosis in 2/7 oligosymptomatic and 4/8 symptomatic dogs. The small number of dogs used in those experiments, compared to the study reported here, may also have contributed to the discrepancy between the two sets of results.",

The non-regenerative feature of the anaemia can be attributed to infection of the bone marrow by L. infantum, inducing infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages that could contribute to a decrease in erythrocyte production. The elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels encountered in most of the animals (data not shown) could also contribute to the anaemia, as this would alter erythropoietin function and reduce erythrocyte life span by its toxic action.

Anaemia would be responsible for some of the classic clinical signs of canine VL, such as apathy, weakness and emaciation, although the clinical presentation is also the sum of disturbances caused by presence of the parasite and inflammatory reactions produced by the immune response. The differences observed can be attributed to the larger number of dogs used in our study.",

The high number of dogs presenting with normal leucocyte counts, as well as the absence of relationships between clinical category and the counts of total leucocytes (or subcategories of leucocytes) showed that the disease has little influence on this parameter. On the other hand, lymphocyte counts do appear to be influenced by the disease, as lymphocytopenia increased in severity with manifestation of clinical disease. This may be attributed to the immunosuppressive nature of VL (Bourdoiseau et al., 1997b, Reis et al., 2006b).",
