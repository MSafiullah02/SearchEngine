A Cochrane review and meta-analysis explored general telemedicine interventions for asthma, finding a potential reduction in hospital admissions, but no impact on quality of life in adults and children,7 though a separate systematic review for adult patients found significant improvements in asthma control and quality of life compared to usual care.8 Although initially deployed and studied as a means of delivering health care to remote and rural areas, the wider implementation of high-speed internet connections in schools and decreasing costs of telemedicine equipment have led to deployment in both urban and rural school districts, and commercial telemedicine suites are marketed for use in school settings.9 Though the literature has provided evidence of some benefit from school-based asthma interventions and general telemedicine asthma interventions independently, there has not been a single systematic review that explores school-based telemedicine program to address pediatric asthma.",

The definition of telemedicine used for inclusion was based on that employed by the Cochrane review of telemedicine interventions for asthma,7 which the authors adapted from Miller11 and consisted of three factors: information obtained from the patient, electronic transfer of this information to a health care professional over a distance, and personalized feedback tailored to the patient. There were no restrictions on the type of electronic transfer, the distance of transfer, type of health care professional, or whether the interpretation of data and personalized feedback occurred synchronously or asynchronously. In order to qualify as \u201cschool-based,\u201d some component of the telemedicine interaction (data collection and/or the provision of individualized feedback) needed to take place in the school setting with assistance or administration by either a school health professional or a dedicated research team member positioned at the school site. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts to identify articles that fit the inclusion criteria. A third author served as an arbitrator for any discrepancies in the agreement of inclusion of articles. All eligible full-text articles included in this review were reviewed independently by at least two of the review authors.",

Two studies included participants with persistent asthma only, while the others did not limit by severity. It should be noted that some studies predated the commonly referenced 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report-3 asthma severity classification guidelines.21 Outcomes reported included symptom-free days, symptom(s) frequency, quality of life measures, health care utilization, school absences, and spirometry.

This study was a telemedicine-enhanced version of a prior intervention called the School-Based Asthma Therapy trial evaluating the direct provision of asthma control medicines at the school, which showed similar effect sizes for symptom-free days, though it has not yet been reported whether the addition of the telemedicine component decreased the overall staffing needs and costs of this intervention.17\n,\n28 Prior reviews of school-based asthma educational interventions have shown positive results for intermediate outcomes, such as quality of life and self-efficacy, but inconsistent results regarding health outcomes and school absences.3, 4, 5 It is plausible that telemedicine could be incorporated to address some of the limitations of prior school-based asthma education programs in effecting health outcomes, such as short intervention duration and limited access to health care to accompany educational programs.3 In addition, many previously reviewed studies were cluster designs. Future studies aimed at generalizability and feasibility in multiple settings may prefer a larger cluster-based design, while studies aimed at estimating the effect differences between telemedicine interventions may benefit from randomizing at the individual school.29\n",

The broad definition of telemedicine we employed necessitated the use of several keywords and synonyms for telemedicine (e.g. telehealth, e-health, e-consult, virtual visit, remote visit, remote consult), but we may not have captured all types of technologies that would fall into our definition of telemedicine.

Early research focused on implementation, technological feasibility and requirements, and user satisfaction rather than clinical outcomes. Higher-quality studies employing RCT designs are needed to draw conclusions on efficacy regarding health outcomes.
