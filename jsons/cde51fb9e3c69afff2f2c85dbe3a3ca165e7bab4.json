There are no effective vaccines or treatment available, and the virus virulence determinants and pathogenesis are not fully understood. Here, we describe the sequencing of RNA extracted from Crandell Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells infected with FIPV using the Illumina next-generation sequencing approach. Bioinformatics analysis, based on Felis catus 2X annotated shotgun reference genome, using CLC bio Genome Workbench is used to map both control and infected cells. Kal's Z test statistical analysis is used to analyze the differentially expressed genes from the infected CRFK cells. In addition, RT-qPCR analysis is used for further transcriptional profi ling of selected genes in infected CRFK cells and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from healthy and FIP-diagnosed cats.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The use of a next-generation sequencing approaches in RNA sequencing has facilitated understanding and defi ning the expression profi les of cellular responses during pathogen infection. This method has been proven to be helpful in explaining the pathogenesis of various viruses [ 1 , 2 ] , including Feline Immunodefi ciency Virus (FIV) [ 3 , 4 ] . Furthermore, the increasing availability of complete genome sequences for a number of model organisms makes host transcriptome analysis a valuable tool for elucidating mechanisms of virus pathogenesis and host responses to virus infection. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is thought to be the causative agent of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Understanding the molecular basis of FIPV pathogenesis will provide valuable information to devise effective treatments and formulate vaccines with higher effi cacy. Once established, focus can be directed at disrupting the virulent determinants or formulating new vaccine or even designing gene therapy treatment. Facilitating this, the complete 1.9X cat genome, using the Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) approach, provides valuable information for bioinformatics analysis of feline host responses following pathogen infection. Moreover, the cat genome contigs were aligned, mapped, and annotated to NCBI annotated genome sequences of six index mammalian genomes (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog and cow) using MegaBLAST [ 5 ] . In this chapter we describe a pipeline for transcriptome analysis using FIPV infection of feline cells in culture as an example. Specifi cally, mRNA harvested from CRFK cells 3 h post infection with FIPV strain 79-1146 were sequenced using Illumina next-generation sequencing technology. The generated data was then analyzed using CLC bio Genomic Workbench, where the genes were compared to Felis catus 1.9X annotated shotgun reference genome. Kal's Z-test on expression proportions [ 6 ] was used to determine signifi cantly expressed genes. Genes expressed with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05 and >1.99and <-1.99-fold change were considered for further analysis. 6.
