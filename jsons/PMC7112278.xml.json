            "text": "The ADAMs, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), ADAMTSs and snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) all possess signal sequences at their N-termini, which direct the proteins to the secretory pathway. This is followed in all by a pro-domain, which acts as an intramolecular chaperone to ensure correct protein folding (Roghani et al., 1999) and functions via a cysteine-switch mechanism to maintain enzyme latency. The pro-domain is generally removed intracellularly during transit through the Golgi system by pro-protein convertases (Lum et al., 1998), though for ADAM-8 and -28 there is evidence that this can involve an autocatalytic mechanism (Howard et al., 2000, Schlomann et al., 2002). The metalloproteinase (MP) domain is immediately C-terminal to the pro-domain, and at this point the structural organization begins to diverge dramatically in different MP families. In the ADAMs, ADAMTSs and SVMPs, the MP domain is followed by a disintegrin-like domain, so-called for the ability of small proteins found in hemorrhagic snake venoms to bind platelet integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b2IIIa thereby blocking platelet aggregation (Niewiarowski et al., 1994). The disintegrin domain contains a 14-amino acid stretch known as the \u201cdisintegrin loop\u201d that is implicated in interactions between ADAMs and integrins (White, 2003). [An exception to this is ADAMDEC-1, which is unusual in being truncated part way through the disintegrin domain through the introduction of a stop codon (Bates et al., 2002)]. The disintegrin domain is followed in the ADAMs by the cysteine-rich domain, which is also seen in the SVMPs and ADAMTSs, though in the latter the first of a series of C-terminal thrombospondin-like repeats is interposed (Porter et al., 2005). Most ADAMs then have an EGF-like domain [though this is absent in ADAM-10 and -17 (Janes et al., 2005)], adjacent to a membrane-spanning region, which is followed by a cytoplasmic tail that varies extensively in length and sequence between different ADAM family members. ADAM cytoplasmic domains have been shown to interact with proteins involved in intracellular signalling, trafficking and cytoarchitecture, and several display proline-rich motifs that can act as ligands for SH3 (Src homology region-3)-domain containing proteins, which will be discussed more extensively in Section 2.5.",

In particular, ADAM12 encodes both a long form (ADAM-12L) that has the typical transmembrane modular structure, and also ADAM-12S which is a secreted form that lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Wewer et al., 2006). A similar situation occurs for ADAM9 (Mazzocca et al., 2005), ADAM11 (Katagiri et al., 1995) and ADAM28 (Fourie et al., 2003, Roberts et al., 1999), while ADAM15 gives rise to as many as 13 different splice variants, all of which affect exons encoding the cytoplasmic domain (Kleino et al., 2007). The pattern of splice variants of ADAM15 is conserved between mouse and humans (Kleino et al., 2007), and this also applies for ADAM22, where again the alternative splicing affects only the cytoplasmic domain (Sagane et al., 2005). Alternative splicing of ADAM19 gives rise to a short form that lacks the pro-, metalloproteinase and disintegrin domains, and is found exclusively intracellularly (Kurisaki et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Thirty-eight members of the ADAM family have been catalogued from various species (http://people.virginia.edu/~jw7g/Table_of_the_ADAMs.html; http://www.uniovi.es/degradome/tables/table_met.htm). There is considerable variation in the ADAM genes between rodents and humans (Puente and Lopez-Otin, 2004, Puente et al., 2003). The human genome contains 25 ADAM genes of which 4 appear to be pseudogenes (see Table 1). In contrast, mouse and rat have 37 and 34 Adam genes, many of which are specifically expressed in testis (Puente and Lopez-Otin, 2004). Of the 21 presumed functional human ADAMs, 13 encode proteins that possess the characteristic reprolysin-type active site (HEXGHXXGXXHD) in the metalloproteinase domain followed downstream by the \u201cMet turn\u201d that is the signature of the Metzincin enzymes (Bode et al., 1993), indicating functional proteolytic capability. Although it is not included in other surveys of the ADAMs, we have chosen to include ADAMDEC-1 (also known as decysin), since we feel it has a legitimate claim for ADAM status. ADAMDEC-1 has the third of the histidines in the Zn-binding site replaced by an aspartate residue (HELGHVLGMPDV), a feature that is also seen in M6 and M7 family metzincins that are active metalloproteinases, and thus ADAMDEC-1 is likely also to be an active endopeptidase (Bates et al., 2002). The catalytically active human ADAM proteases are thus: ADAMDEC-1, ADAM-8, -9, 10, -12, -15, -17, -19, -20, -21, -28, -30 and -33. In contrast, ADAM-2, -7, -11, -18, -22, -23, -29 and -32 lack one or more critical features in the Zn-binding active site, suggesting that the metalloproteinase domain in these proteins may play roles in protein folding and protein\u2013protein interactions rather than catalysis. However, based on studies with gene knockout mice which will be discussed in Section 1.3, it is clear that there are important developmental roles for individual ADAMs of both the active and proteolytically inactive groupings. Table 2\nprovides an overview of the substrates that have been identified for the catalytically active ADAMs, many of which will be considered in more detail when ADAM functions are explored in Section 3.",

            "text": "For the MMPs, a major level of control occurs via their interaction with specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), of which there are four in mammals (Baker et al., 2002). TIMPs inhibit MMPs by forming 1:1 tight, non-covalent complexes with active enzymes. With a few notable exceptions, TIMPs are broadly interchangeable in their ability to inhibit the MMPs, an exception being TIMP-1, which is inactive against MT1-MMP/MMP-14 and certain other MMPs (Baker et al., 2002). However, the TIMPs show much greater specificity towards the ADAM proteinases (see Table 1). In general, TIMP-3 is a functional inhibitor of the majority of proteolytically active ADAMs, and individual ADAMs display characteristic susceptibilities to the other TIMPs. The catalytic domain of ADAM-10 is inhibited by both TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 (Amour et al., 2000), whereas ADAM-8, -9 and -19 defy any pattern and are insensitive to TIMP inhibition (Amour et al., 2002, Chesneau et al., 2003). In contrast, ADAM-12S has recently been shown to be inhibited by TIMP-3 and TIMP-2 in preference to TIMP-1 (Jacobsen et al., 2008). ADAM-33 is moderately inhibited by TIMP-3 and TIMP-4, but weakly by TIMP-2 and is insensitive to TIMP-1 (Zou et al., 2004). These highly divergent characteristics reflect the importance of not only the MP domain in binding of TIMPs to active metalloproteinases, and this aspect will be discussed further in a following section. In addition to TIMPs, REversion-inducing Cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK), an unrelated protein that also displays MMP inhibitory capability (Baker et al., 2002) has been shown to be a physiological inhibitor of ADAM-10 in development of the nervous system (Muraguchi et al., 2007).",

The mechanisms are poorly understood, though involvement of the cytoplasmic domain is an obvious possibility. Phosphorylation or other modifications of the cytoplasmic domain may influence the interactions of ADAMs with adapter or trafficking proteins that direct substrate interactions or location in membrane sub-domains or other specific cellular locations. However, the cytoplasmic domain may be necessary only for particular functions, since the membrane localization and stimulus-induced shedding elicited by ADAM-17 and -19 has been shown, at least in some model systems, to occur in the absence of their cytoplasmic domains, and is dependent only on a membrane-spanning region (Reddy et al., 2000, Wakatsuki et al., 2004). Following stimulation, ADAM-17 rapidly disappears from the cell surface via endocytosis (Doedens and Black, 2000) which represents another potential control point for regulation of ADAM function.",

The C. intestinalis genome is particularly insightful because Ciona is one of the closest invertebrate relatives of vertebrates. Its genome contains 4 ADAM genes: ADAMa and ADAMb are orthologous to ADAM17 and ADAM10, respectively, and define an A sub-group, while ADAMc1 and c2 genes define a separate B sub-group that corresponds to human ADAM2, 7\u20139, 11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 28, 32, and 33. The remaining human ADAMs are specific to the vertebrate lineage, though as the authors point out, it is possible that invertebrate orthologs of these genes may have been lost during evolution. Like Ciona, Drosophila melanogaster contains orthologs of ADAM17 and ADAM10. Indeed there are two Drosophila genes that are highly similar to ADAM10 \u2013 kuzbanian (kuz) and kul (Huxley-Jones et al., 2007). Drosophila also has two genes corresponding to the B subgroup seen in Ciona. The sea urchin Strongylocentrus purpuratus contains only 2 ADAM genes, and does not seem to have an ortholog of ADAM10, though an ortholog exists in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Angerer et al., 2006). The two sea urchin genes appear to be most closely related to ADAM17 and one of the B subgroup Ciona ADAMs (described as ADAM12/15/19/33-like) (Angerer et al., 2006). The absence of an ADAM10 ortholog in sea urchin is perhaps surprising, given the central role of this protease in signalling via the Notch pathway.",

ADAM-10 is the principal ADAM sheddase involved in Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP), with critical actions on Notch/Delta signalling and APP processing (Saftig and Hartmann, 2005; Fig. 4\n). Notch is a transmembrane protein that undergoes three proteolytic cleavages during its functional lifecycle. The first is cleavage by a pro-protein convertase in the secretary apparatus, so that the protein appears on the surface as a heterodimeric protein (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999). The second (S2) cleavage occurs upon activation by binding of one of several ligands (e.g. Delta and Jagged), followed by a third cleavage in the plane of the membrane by \u03b3-secretase, which is composed of the aspartate proteases, presenilins 1 and 2 (Selkoe, 2001). This final cleavage releases the cytoplasmic domain of Notch, which then binds to a member of the CSL (CBF1, Su[H], Lag-1) family of transcription factors, which activate downstream genes (Schlondorff and Blobel, 1999). Evidence is now very strong that ADAM-10 is the main protease responsible for the S2 cleavage. Loss of ADAM-10 leads to early embryonic lethality around 9.5 days post coitum, with multiple defects in the developing central nervous and cardiovascular systems and somites, which closely resemble those seen in mice deficient in Notch/Delta signalling (Hartmann et al., 2002). This observation concurs with the findings from Drosophila, which indicated that the Kuzbanian (Kuz) gene was essential for controlling neural cell fate decisions in the developing nervous system via proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane receptor Notch (Pan and Rubin, 1997, Rooke et al., 1996). Likewise the C. elegans orthologue (sup-17) was identified as a suppressor of the phenotype caused by constitutively active Notch/LIN-12 (Saftig and Hartmann, 2005). This therefore represents a fundamental biological signalling mechanism that is conserved from worms to mammals (Horiuchi et al., 2005).",

However, Adam17\u2212/\u2212 mice do not show any defects related to Notch signalling (see below). Similar to Notch, APP is a transmembrane protein subject to RIPping via metalloproteinase and \u03b3-secretase action (Saftig and Hartmann, 2005). Ectodomain shedding can involve either \u03b1- or \u03b2-secretases, which cleave differentially, the latter giving rise to A\u03b2 peptides that result in the deposition of amyloid plaque, whereas the former produces a soluble extracellular fragment (APPs\u03b1) that is non-amyloidogenic (Schlondorff and Blobel, 1999). It is clear that both ADAM-10 and -17 can act as \u03b1-secretases (Allinson et al., 2003), and fibroblasts from Adam10\u2212/\u2212 mice showed no deficiency in \u03b1-secretase activity, probably due to compensation by ADAM-17 (Hartmann et al., 2002). However, overexpression of functional ADAM-10 in neurons in transgenic mice that also overexpress human APP led to increased production of APPs\u03b1 and reduced amyloid plaque formation and overall cognitive deficits (Postina et al., 2004). In contrast an inactive ADAM-10 promoted Alzheimer-like pathology. These findings strongly implicate ADAM-10 as a physiologically relevant \u03b1-secretase. But in addition to Notch/Delta, ADAM-10 has many other biologically relevant targets, including ephrin-A5 and E-cadherin ((Janes et al., 2005, Maretzky et al., 2005a); Table 1). It is likely that the early lethality of Adam10\u2212/\u2212 mice due to the Notch signalling defect masks detection of other critical developmental processes in which ADAM-10 participates.",

Several Adam knockouts result in viable mice with no obvious pathologies, including Adam9\u2212/\u2212, Adam12\u2212/\u2212 and Adam15\u2212/\u2212 mice, though 30% mortality of Adam12\u2212/\u2212 pups in the first week after birth has been seen in one study (Kurisaki et al., 2003). However, in another study triple knockout Adam9/12/15\u2212/\u2212 are also viable and fertile and are generated in the correct Mendelian ratios (Sahin et al., 2004), suggesting that these differences may in part be attributable to the genetic background (Horiuchi et al., 2005). As meltrin-\u03b1, ADAM-12 had originally been implicated in muscle formation, where its expression in myoblasts along with ADAM-19 (Meltrin-\u03b2) and ADAM-9 (Meltrin-\u03b3) was linked to myoblast fusion to generate multinucleated myotubes (Yagami-Hiromasa et al., 1995). [Parenthetically, the notion that ADAMs had roles in cell fusion arose from their first identification as Fertilins, with a suggested role in sperm\u2013egg fusion via a fusion peptide sequence in the Cys-rich sequence of fertilin-\u03b1 (Blobel et al., 1992) but to date experimental proof of a role for any ADAM in cell fusion is lacking (Tousseyn et al., 2006)]. No defect in muscle formation has been observed in Adam12\u2212/\u2212, or in Adam9\u2212/\u2212 animals. Overexpression of ADAM-12 on a muscle-specific promoter was shown to alleviate the muscular dystrophy pathology in mdx mice in the short term (Moghadaszadeh et al., 2003), but in aged mdx mice this situation was reversed, with accentuation of the dystrophic phenotype and suppression of muscle regeneration following freeze-thaw injury (Jorgensen et al., 2007). Expression of ADAM-12 has been linked to the formation of quiescent reserve cells, otherwise known as satellite cells, that have the properties of self-renewing stem cells and are stimulated to proliferate and contribute to muscle formation following injury or repair (Cao et al., 2003). Conceivably forced overexpression of ADAM-12 may interfere with subsequent recruitment of these cells. Thus the role of ADAM-12 in muscle formation is unclear, particularly as Adam9/12/15/19-quadruple-null mice show no apparent muscle defect, arguing against possible compensation by other Meltrins (Horiuchi et al., 2005). However, Adam12-null animals show minor defects in brown adipose tissue formation (Kurisaki et al., 2003), and transgenic over-expression enhanced adipogenesis (Kawaguchi et al., 2002). Furthermore, Adam12\u2212/\u2212 mice showed reduced weight gain and numbers of adipocytes when fed a high fat diet, suggesting a role in adipocyte proliferation and differentiation (Masaki et al., 2005).",

The characterization of ADAM-17 as the TNF-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE) has unlocked an unexpected wealth of information about protein ectodomain shedding that has had repercussions throughout cell and developmental biology. In particular, since mice lacking TNF-\u03b1 are overtly normal, a key finding from knockout mice in which Adam17 was disrupted (by deletion of the Zn-binding site in the MP domain) was that ADAM-17 has roles in addition to pro-TNF-\u03b1 activation, and is in fact required for EGF receptor (EGFR) signalling during normal development (Peschon et al., 1998). The Adam17\u2212/\u2212 mice died close to birth (at around 17.5 days post coitum), with open eye lids, hair and skin abnormalities and defects in epithelial maturation of multiple organs, all of which resemble defects seen in mice lacking EGFR or its ligands heparin-binding-EGF (HB-EGF), amphiregulin and transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1) (Blobel, 2005, Horiuchi et al., 2005). In particular, HB-EGF\u2212/\u2212 mice die before weaning with defects in valvulogenesis in the heart and hypoplastic, poorly differentiated lungs that parallel those seen in Adam17\u2212/\u2212 mice (Jackson et al., 2003, Shi et al., 2003, Zhao et al., 2001). It appears that both ADAM-9 and -19 also contribute to heart development, since double knockouts with Adam17 led to exacerbated heart phenotypes, suggesting redundant or compensatory roles for these ADAMs, which are only unmasked in the absence of the major HB-EGF sheddase, ADAM-17 (Horiuchi et al., 2005).",

Adam22\u2212/\u2212 mice are born in the appropriate Mendelian ratio but die before weaning, which has been linked to hypomyelination of peripheral nerves, leading to ataxia (Sagane et al., 2005). ADAM-22 has been shown to be the receptor for a secreted neuronal protein LGI1, mutations in which cause a genetically determined form of epilepsy [autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy, ADLTE; (Fukata et al., 2006)]. The LGI1 is expressed from the presynaptic neuron and binds to ADAM-22 on the surface of post-synaptic neurons. A model has been presented in which the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM-22 interacts with a scaffold protein PSD-95, which in turn can interact with the AMPA receptor responsible for glutaminergic signalling (Snyder, 2006). Defects in this pathway may lead to the aberrant excitation associated with epilepsy. However no mutations were found in ADLTE patients previously identified as negative for LGI1 mutations (Chabrol et al., 2007), so the role of ADAM-22 in neuronal function requires further exploration.",

However, most of this information has come from study of the isolated catalytic domain, and only recently has the overall molecular architecture of the complete metalloproteinase/disintegrin/cysteine-rich (MDC) structure begun to emerge (Igarashi et al., 2007, Takeda et al., 2006). These new structures have again come from the SVMPs, namely, vascular apoptosis-inducing factor-1 (VAP-1) and VAP-2B, but as the residues identified in these studies as important for stabilizing the multidomain architecture appear to be strictly conserved throughout all the ADAMs, they no doubt shed light on general mechanisms of substrate recognition and cleavage by mammalian ADAMs. The key message from the recent findings is that the overall MDC domain structure results in a C-shaped molecule, whereby part of the Cys-rich domain faces towards the catalytic site in the M domain (Takeda et al., 2006). This part of the C-domain is comprises a hyper-variable region (HVR) that differs markedly between ADAM family members and it is proposed that this plays an important role in substrate binding. This \u201cC-shape\u201d structure also has implications for the potential of the disintegrin domain to participate in adhesive interactions, which will be discussed further.",

            "text": "The metalloproteinase catalytic domain in the ADAMs is typical of the metzincin clan, which is a globular structure divided into two subdomains, with the active site cleft running between the two (Gomis-Ruth, 2003). The upper, N-terminal subdomain consists of a highly twisted, 5-stranded \u03b2-pleated sheet, the strands of which lie parallel to each other and to the substrate, which binds in an extended fashion, essentially running horizontally, left to right along the groove in the schematic of the SVMP Adamalysin II shown in Fig. 5\nA. Multiple \u03b1-helices also create structural features in the upper subdomain, with the lower \u03b1B helix of the Adamalysin II structure containing the HEXXH of the catalytic Zn-binding site. The clan-defining feature of the Metzincins is an absolutely conserved methionine residue creating a 1,4-\u03b2-turn (Met-turn) (Bode et al., 1993) that then correctly positions the lower subdomain to create the catalytic cleft. This lower subdomain has relatively few features apart from an \u03b1-helix towards the C-terminus. The catalytic Zn atom sits at the bottom of the groove between the subdomains, with subsites in the groove (S3S2S1S1\u2032S2\u2032S3\u2032) determining specificity for particular amino acid sequences (P3P2P1P1\u2032P2\u2032P3\u2032) in the substrate, where cleavage occurs between the P1 and P1\u2032 residues (Fig. 5B). The topology of this groove, and in particular the depth and hydrophobicity of the S1\u2032 specificity pocket, is critical for building selectivity into the design of synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitors. Three disulfide bonds are also involved in stabilizing the ADAM metalloproteinase domain structure, along with a structural Ca2+ in many, including ADAM-33 (Orth et al., 2004), but not in ADAM-17 (Maskos et al., 1998). Within this overall consensus structure, the presence of different numbers of \u03b1-helices and insertion loops between them create unique surface features that would be expected to affect substrate recognition. Thus although ADAM-17 and ADAM-33 (which to date are the only members of the mammalian ADAM family proper for which the structures have been solved) possess the same layout of secondary structure elements, their catalytic domains share only 26% identity (Orth et al., 2004).",

The N-terminus region of the Cys-rich (C) domain that follows is termed a \u201cwrist\u201d (Cw) domain, and together the Ds, Da and Cw domains shape the whole molecule into the form of a C (Takeda et al., 2006). There are few secondary structure elements in the resulting C-shaped arm, with disulfide bonds and two Ca2+-binding sites holding the structure together. Most importantly in this structure, the disintegrin loop that is widely considered to be responsible for the interactions between ADAMs and integrins (which will be discussed in detail in Section 2.3) is packed against the Cw-domain and is thus inaccessible for binding (Takeda et al., 2006). The \u201cwrist\u201d Cw domain is followed by a \u201chand\u201d Ch segment, which contains at its distal portion the hypervariable region (HVR), which is proposed by Takeda and co-workers to be a key exosite involved in target recognition (Igarashi et al., 2007).

These enzymes cleave at a consensus RX(R/K)R motif. The pro-domain functions via a Cysteine switch mechanism, as in the MMPs (Loechel et al., 1999, Roghani et al., 1999). Further support for this view comes from mutational studies of the putative PC site, which is shown to block the activation of ADAM-10 (Anders et al., 2001). However, since the autocatalytic processing of PCs is itself regulated, in some cases involving retention of the cleaved pro-domain in complex with the PC, there is potential for regulated activation of their ADAM zymogens at the cell surface (Mayer et al., 2008). Moreover for at least two ADAMs (ADAM-8 and -28) there is evidence from analysis of inactive E-A mutations in the Zn-binding site for autocatalytic removal of the pro-domain (Howard et al., 2000, Schlomann et al., 2002).",

Interestingly, at least for ADAM-17 the inhibition of active forms via isolated pro-domains does not seem to involve the Cys-switch mechanism involved in maintaining latency (Gonzales et al., 2004), and indeed it has been suggested that the main functions of the pro-domain are to act as a chaperone and to protect the enzymes from degradation in the secretory system (Anders et al., 2001, Milla et al., 2006). This is suggested by the ability of the pro-domain of ADAM-10 to rescue in trans an otherwise inactive ADAM-10 mutant lacking the pro-domain (Anders et al., 2001). For ADAM-12 the excised pro-domain has been observed to remain non-covalently associated with the mature form of the molecule extracellularly, with the whole molecule adopting a \u201cfour-leaf clover\u201d structure where one of the four globular domains is the pro-domain (Wewer et al., 2006). Thus the pro-domains of ADAMs have multiple functions in maintaining latency and stability, ensuring proper folding and entry into the secretory pathway, and perhaps also functional interactions outside the cell.",

Numerous substrates of ADAM-17 and -19 are also localized in these rafts, along with furin.

In the SVMPs, ADAMs and ADAMTSs, the disintegrin domain should more accurately be called \u201cdisintegrin-like\u201d, because with the exception of human ADAM-15 they lack the RGD sequence in their disintegrin loops and they also have additional Cys residues missing from \u201ctrue\u201d venom disintegrins (Evans, 2001). The initial identification of disintegrin-like domains when the first mammalian ADAMs were identified led to the hypothesis that these regions would interact with integrins, like the related sequences in snake venoms (Wolfsberg et al., 1995). There is now considerable evidence that extracellular domains of ADAMs do indeed interact with integrins, and studies of recombinant disintegrin domains have identified a consensus motif present in their disintegrin loops, namely CRXXXXXCDXXEXC (White et al., 2005). In many cases these interactions have been shown to influence cell adhesion and cell\u2013cell interactions.

However a few studies have looked at the effects of ADAMs on adhesion and migration of cells by studying the intact molecule. If we consider ADAM-12, whose disintegrin domain has previously been shown to interact with integrin \u03b14\u03b21, expression of full-length ADAM-12 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes revealed an ADAM-12/\u03b21 association, which impaired integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading (Kawaguchi et al., 2003). When expressed in CHO cells that carried defined integrins (\u03b14\u03b21, \u03b15\u03b21 or both), ADAM12 inhibited migration of \u03b14\u03b21-expressing cells but not those expressing \u03b15\u03b21, i.e. the pattern mirrored that of the recombinant disintegrin domain (Huang et al., 2005). Likewise ADAM-19 and ADAM-33 inhibited migration consistent with the binding preferences of their isolated disintegrin domains. Bax et al. (2004) have also presented evidence for interactions between the full extracellular portion of ADAM-17 and \u03b15\u03b21 both in cis and in trans, and then narrowed the association down to the distintegrin-cysteine-rich region.",

(2006)). These observations raise interesting mechanistic questions, which might be resolved by detailed crystal structure information of intact cellular ADAMs. Also, a key aspect may relate to the involvement of intracellular interaction partners of the ADAMs via their cytoplasmic domains. We have recently observed that two splice variants of ADAM-15 that differ only in their cytoplasmic domains by the inclusion of an additional proline-rich sequence in the longer of the two, have opposing effects on adhesion and migration (Zhong et al., 2008). These different cytoplasmic domain have common (Grb2, FISH) and distinct (Src, Brk) interaction partners, which may lead to isoform-specific effects on intracellular signalling or protein localization or trafficking.",

For ADAM-12, the Cys-rich domain mediates adhesive interactions with syndecans, leading subsequently to engagement with \u03b21-containing integrins (Iba et al., 2000, Thodeti et al., 2003). In Xenopus laevis the metalloproteinase activity of ADAM-13 is required for cranial neural crest cell migration (Alfandari et al., 2001), and when ADAM-13 is over-expressed in embryos it leads to hyperplasia of the cement gland (Smith et al., 2002). Though the catalytic domain of ADAM-10 can be substituted for that of ADAM-13, the cement gland hyperplasia phenotype critically requires the Cys-rich domain, which is consistent with involvement of the Cys-rich domain in substrate interactions. This is further supported by demonstration of the association of the ADAM-13 disintegrin/Cys-rich domains with fibronectin (Gaultier et al., 2002). Also, domain deletion analysis showed that the Cys-rich domain of TACE is required for the shedding of the IL-1 Receptor-II, but not for its ability to shed TNF-\u03b1 or the p75TNF receptor (Reddy et al., 2000).",

Ephrins are cell-associated ligands (either GPI-anchored in the case of the ephrin-A ligands or transmembrane for the ephrin-B class) for Eph tyrosine kinase receptors which generate bidirectional signalling in adjacent cells upon ephrin-Eph engagement (Pasquale, 2008). Fundamentally, ephrin-Eph signalling involves cell repulsion following engagement, which is important for neuronal guidance and also for establishment of the arterial and venous vascular networks. This repulsion involves cleavage of the ephrin ligand following binding to its cognate Eph (Hattori et al., 2000). Janes et al. (2005) have shown that ADAM-10 constitutively associates with the ephrin binding domain of EphA3, and that formation of the EphA3/ephrin-A5 complex creates a high affinity binding site for the Cys-rich domain of ADAM-10, which binds to neither component alone. This in turn results in a conformational switch such that the ADAM-10 metalloproteinase domain is positioned to be able to cleave the ephrin-A5 in trans. The key feature is an acidic pocket in the C-terminus of the Cys-rich domain, likely the hypervariable region observed by Takeda et al. (2006). This model may be a paradigm for a much wider range of ADAM actions.",

This led to speculation that the cytoplasmic domains may play important roles in regulating protease function in response to intracellular signalling events (i.e. inside\u2013out signalling), or also that they could be involved in outside\u2013in signalling following engagement of their ectodomains with substrates or adhesion partners, leading to recruitment of signalling molecules and adapters.

            "text": "The significance of the cytoplasmic domains for ADAM functions rests on several observations. First, although the overall sequence identity between ADAM orthologues is less in the cytoplasmic tail regions than in sequences encoding the ectodomains, the Pro-rich motifs are generally well conserved. For example, comparison of mammalian and zebrafish ADAM12 shows that 5 of the PxxP are conserved with good identity in surrounding sequence blocks and several others may be substituted functionally since the Danio rerio gene has 12 copies of the motif overall in its cytoplasmic domain. Second, there are now clear examples where the cytoplasmic domain plays a key role in ADAM function, either by regulating catalytic activity or by trafficking the protein to the correct cellular location (Cao et al., 2002). ADAM-12 is stored intracellularly as a mature, active protein but appears on the surface in response to PMA stimulation (Hougaard et al., 2000), and this regulated translocation requires the cytoplasmic domain and is dependent on PKC\u03b5 (Sundberg et al., 2004). The SH3-domain-containing protein PACSIN3, which is involved in endocytosis and interacts with proteins such as dynamin and N-WASP, interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of several ADAMs including ADAM-9, -10, -12, 15 and -19, but not that of ADAM-17 (Mori et al., 2003). The ADAM-12/PACSIN3 association was shown to be functionally important for ADAM-12 mediated shedding of HB-EGF in response to PMA or the GPCR agonist angiotensin II. Likewise another ADAM-12 interactor, Eve-1, which is an SH3-containing adapter protein that also binds with several ADAM cytoplasmic domains including ADAM-17 has been shown by siRNA knockdown studies to be important for stimulus-activated shedding by ADAM-12 (Tanaka et al., 2004). Yet another ADAM-12 interacting protein is the scaffolding protein Tks5/Fish, which is a Src substrate that contains 5 SH3 domains and a Phox homology domain that binds phosphatidyl inositols (Abram et al., 2003). Tks5/Fish co-localizes with ADAM-12 in actin-rich podosomes, sometimes known as invadopodia, suggesting that it may be important for spatially organizing ADAM-12 activity. This suggests an interesting interplay of factors regulating signalling at the cell surface, since ADAM-12 itself binds Src and has been reported to activate Src activity in C2C12 cells (Kang et al., 2000), whilst also recruiting and activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) via SH3 domain/pro-motif interactions (Kang et al., 2001).",

It is unclear at present what intracellular protein mediates this trafficking, though Synapse Associated Protein-97 (SAP97) is an SH3-domain containing protein that interacts with this region of ADAM-10 (Marcello et al., 2007) and is responsible for correct localization of ADAM-10 in synaptic membranes, thereby promoting its \u03b1-secretase activity.

            "text": "Despite the intense activity on the study of ADAM-17 and its involvement in stimulus-induced ectodomain shedding, there are still conflicting views as to the role of its cytoplasmic domain. Its association with the PDZ-domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatise-1H (PTP1H) inhibits PMA-stimulated pro-TNF-\u03b1 activation (Zheng et al., 2002). ADAM-17 is able to associate with Erk MAP kinase and is phosphorylated by it on Thr 735 leading to enhanced cleavage of the TrkA neurotrophin receptor in CHO cells (Diaz-Rodriguez et al., 2002). Moreover, Soond et al. (2005) have reported that trafficking of ADAM-17 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface was dependent on Erk phosphorylation at Thr 735. Meanwhile Fan et al. (2003) observed PMA-induction of phosphorylation at Ser819, but neither mutation of this site or deletion of the entire cytoplasmic domain affected serum-induced pro-TGF-\u03b1 cleavage, which is consistent with the studies from Black and co-workers (Doedens et al., 2003, Reddy et al., 2000), where full PMA-inducible ADAM-17 activity occurred with inclusion of just the membrane spanning region for correct insertion in the membrane (Reddy et al., 2000, Doedens et al., 2003). Thus the mechanism responsible for PMA activation of ADAM-17 is still unclear. This could involve PMA-induced release of an inhibitor, such as the pro-domain of ADAM-17 itself, or TIMP-3, though the experiments of Doedens et al. (2003) argue against these proposals. An alternative may be that PMA activation may modify another protein leading to an interaction with ADAM-17, potentially altering its engagement with substrates within the lipid-rich domains where it is primarily localized (see Section 2.2).",

Recent data have helped unravel the GPCR-EGFR crosstalk elicited by gastrin-releasing peptide, which involves phosphorylation of ADAM-17 by PDK1, as a result of Src and PI3K activation by the GRP receptor (Zhang et al., 2006). This leads to amphiregulin release and EGFR signalling. Thus the cytoplasmic domains of ADAMs likely couple ADAM activity to signalling pathways in a cell- and stimulus-specific fashion.",

            "text": "The ability of natural TIMPs to inhibit ADAMs is summarised in Table 1. In general, TIMPs display much greater selectivity towards the ADAMs than MMPs, and several ADAMs are inhibited exclusively by TIMP-3 (Baker et al., 2002). Indeed this latter characteristic has often been used to characterize the nature of the metalloprotease involvement in a shedding event, though as we learn more about the interplay between TIMPs and ADAMs more detailed evidence should be presented if ADAM involvement is suggested. TIMPs are two-domain molecules, with a larger N-terminal domain that is responsible for MMP inhibition, and a smaller C-terminal domain that provides specificity for additional protein\u2013protein interactions including the pro-forms of particular MMPs. The mechanism of TIMP-MMP inhibition was solved by the crystal structure of the MMP-3/TIMP-1 complex (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1997), which revealed an elongated wedge-shaped ridge of TIMP-1 that docks with the active site cleft. This mechanism critically depends upon the sequence of the N-terminus of the mature TIMP molecule, since the first four residues lie in the active site in a fashion equivalent to the P1\u2013P1\u2032\u2013P2\u2032\u2013P3\u2032 residues of a peptide substrate. The N-terminal Cys1 residue is responsible for Zn-chelation via its \u03b1-amino and carbonyl groups. Extension of TIMPs by a single residue at the N-terminus renders them non-functional against MMPs, however a N-terminal domain TIMP-3 mutant extended by an Ala residue at its N-terminus retained activity against ADAM-17, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism is dissimilar (Wei et al., 2005). Moreover, a Thr2Gly replacement at position 2, which reduces the affinity of TIMP-1 for MMPs by three orders of magnitude, retained potency against ADAM-17. Further protein engineering studies of TIMPs have dissected the basis of TIMP-MMP and TIMP\u2013ADAM interactions, and it is clear that sites distal to those involved in interactions in the active site cleft have profound influences. Indeed, although the N-terminal domain and full-length form of TIMP-3 are equally potent against the isolated catalytic domain of ADAM-17 (Lee et al., 2001), the extra-catalytic domains of ADAM-17, and in particular the Cys-rich region, substantially weakened the inhibitory effects of N-TIMP3 (Lee et al., 2003). The TIMP-3 forms studied by Wei et al. (2005) show positive co-operativity in binding to the whole ectodomain of ADAM-17, implying multiple interactions. Recent studies using stopped-flow X-ray spectroscopy show dynamic charge transitions at the active site Zn of ADAM-17 prior to substrate engagement with the ion, which implies communication between distal sites of the molecule and the catalytic core (Solomon et al., 2007). Further support for the importance of distal protein interactions between TIMPs and exosites away from the catalytic cleft come from the observations that the N-terminal domains of TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 are ineffective as inhibitors of ADAM-10 compared to the full-length TIMPs (Rapti et al., 2008).",

            "text": "There has been considerable interest in the development of synthetic inhibitors of ADAMs as therapeutic agents (Moss and Bartsch, 2004). Given the central importance of ADAM-17 in inflammatory processes, and the success of anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapies in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, there is a strong case for the design of selective TACE inhibitors (Moss et al., 2008a). Likewise, ADAM-10 involvement in the shedding of HER2 from the cell surface (Liu et al., 2006) makes it a promising target for anti-cancer therapy (Moss et al., 2008b). As we have seen, the metalloproteinase catalytic domain has overall structural similarity with other metzincins (Section 2.1), but there are distinctive features that have allowed the development of a number of selective compounds. In particular the deep, curved hydrophobic S1\u2032 pocket of ADAM-17, which merges below the surface with the deep S3\u2032 pocket (Maskos et al., 1998) has been exploited to develop a range of compounds showing good selectivity and potency, with K\ni\u2019s in the lower nM range (Condon et al., 2007, Huang et al., 2007, Niu et al., 2006, Wasserman et al., 2003). Four selective ADAM-17 inhibitors are in clinical trials for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: BMS-561392 and TMI-005 (apratastat) progressed to phase II trials, and GI5402 and R618 are in phase I (Moss et al., 2008a). However further development of some of these compounds has already halted, including those in phase II trials, due to mechanism-based liver toxicity. It is possible that despite their toxicity profiles some of these potent, selective compounds might find clinical utility in other diseases such as cancer. In this regard, INCB3619 is a potent inhibitor of both ADAM-10 and -17 which reduced the processing of multiple EGFR ligands in vitro and in vivo in tumour-bearing mice, and reduced tumour growth appreciably (Fridman et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The first mammalian ADAMs identified were the two subunits of the heterodimeric sperm protein fertilin, ADAM1 (fertilin-\u03b1) and ADAM2 (fertilin-\u03b2; Blobel et al., 1992), whose functions have been studied extensively in rodents (Primakoff and Myles, 2000, Primakoff and Myles, 2002). These proteins were originally proposed to be important for sperm\u2013egg binding and fusion, since an anti-fertilin-\u03b2 monoclonal antibody blocked guinea pig sperm\u2013egg fusion. Fertilin-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 are proteolytically processed at different stages of sperm maturation by cleavage after the MP domain, leaving the disintegrin as the N-terminus of the sperm-associated proteins and thus potentially free to engage with egg integrins (Primakoff and Myles, 2000). In support of this, fertilin-\u03b2 was shown to bind to \u03b16\u03b21 integrin (Almeida et al., 1995), and a peptide based on the disintegrin domain of fertilin-\u03b2 blocked sperm\u2013egg binding (Primakoff and Myles, 2000). Fertilin-\u03b2-null mice are infertile, but fertilin-\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 sperm fuse with eggs in vitro at approximately 50% of the level of wild-type sperm, so fertilin-\u03b2 is not essential for fusion (Primakoff and Myles, 2002). Sperm from these animals in fact show multiple defects in sperm\u2013egg adhesion and fusion, in migration from the uterus, and in binding to the zona pellucida surrounding the egg (Cho et al., 1998). It transpires that there are complex relationships between ADAMs that are expressed in spermatogenic cells and sperm, such that deficiencies in one ADAM lead to reductions in the levels of several others that appear on the sperm surface (Kim et al., 2006). Adam3 (Cyritestin)-null male mice are also infertile (Primakoff and Myles, 2002) and ADAM-7 and ADAM-5 are reduced on the surface of sperm from fertilin-\u03b2- and Adam3-null mice (Kim et al., 2006) Moreover, eggs from integrin \u03b16-null mice bind and fuse normally with sperm (Primakoff and Myles, 2002). Thus the precise contributions of ADAMs in sperm function are still not clear. Some may function at early stages in spermatogenesis and in sperm migration in the uterus/oviduct and in zona pellucida binding, while some may function as chaperones to allow the correct assembly of ADAMs or other proteins on the sperm surface. How the situation in rodents relates to spermatogenesis and fertility in humans is also unclear, since many of the testis-specific Adam genes of rodents are represented only as pseudogenes in humans, including ADAM1 and ADAM3 (Puente and Lopez-Otin, 2004).",

The involvement of the cytokine TNF-\u03b1 in a variety of diseases associated with inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and Crohn\u2019s disease, made the mechanism of its activation of great clinical and pharmaceutical relevance. However, as discussed in Section 1.3, ADAM-17 has emerged as a sheddase with an extremely broad substrate range, with fundamental links to EGFR signalling. Since EGF and related ligands (HB-EGF, TGF-\u03b1, epiregulin, amphiregulin and betacellulin) are all produced initially as membrane-associated molecules that require proteolytic processing, this identifies ADAM-17 (and related sheddases) as upstream regulators of one of the most important signalling pathways in vertebrates.",

Shedding may remove signalling ligands to down-modulate or terminate signalling. Likewise, cleavage and release of signalling receptors may down-modulate signalling capability on the cell surface, or generate soluble receptors that act as decoys by sequestering ligands.",

The availability of cells from gene knockout mice has revolutionized the analysis of ADAM involvement in ectodomain shedding. For instance, study of cells from cells derived from mice deficient in either ADAM-9, -10, 12, -15, 17 or -19 has shown that within the EGFR ligand family, ADAM-10 is the main sheddase for EGF and betacellulin, whilst ADAM-17 is largely responsible for cleavage of TGF-\u03b1, epiregulin, amphiregulin and HB-EGF (Sahin et al., 2004).",

For instance, using Adam-null cell lines and transfecting in functional ADAM proteins, Zheng et al. (2004) demonstrated involvement of ADAM-17 in phorbol-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 shedding, but ADAM-19 was able to cause constitutive release following transfection of Adam17\u2212/\u2212 cells, whereas ADAM-9, 10, and -19 could not. A typical pattern is shown by the L1 adhesion molecule, for which ADAM-10 mediates constitutive shedding while ADAM-17 carries out cleavage after phorbol stimulation or cholesterol depletion (Maretzky et al., 2005b). The calcium ionophore ionomycin activates ADAM-10 mediated shedding of CD30 (Eichenauer et al., 2007) and the chemokines CX3CL1 and CXCL16 (Hundhausen et al., 2007). It is important to understand the full physiological repertoire of the shedding events controlled by ADAMs such as ADAM-17 and the redundancy and compensation by multiple ADAM family members if these enzymes are to be targeted by pharmacological inhibitors.",

Table 6\nlists several of these studies and further information can be found in the review by Ohtsu et al. (2006). The first clear demonstration that this GPCR-EGFR crosstalk involved cleavage of an EGFR ligand came from the work of Prenzel et al. (1999), who highlighted an absolute requirement for metalloproteinase activity by using batimastat, a broad spectrum synthetic inhibitor of MMPs and ADAMs, and further showed that that HB-EGF was involved from use of a mutant diphtheria toxin (Crm 7) that blocks HB-EGF function. This study explained the inability to identify free ligand in conditioned medium, since shed HB-EGF was retained in the pericellular ECM, and activation of EGFR signalling was critically dependent on high cell density. The transmembrane form of pro-TGF\u03b1 is inactive in stimulating the EGFR on adjacent cells, such that ADAM-17 is essential for juxtacrine signalling (Borrell-Pages et al., 2003). In part this may involve ligand solubilisation to allow diffusion and action in a paracrine fashion, but by analogy with the ephrin-A5/EphA3 signalling scenario discussed earlier (Janes et al., 2005) it is possible that ADAM-17-mediated cleavage of the TGF\u03b1/EGFR complex may be necessary to elicit EGFR activation.",

This concept is encapsulated in Fig. 8\n. The intracellular linkages between GPCR and ADAM activation are still opaque, but participation of the cytoplasmic domain of the ADAM seems both logical and efficient. This aspect has been addressed by Grandis and colleagues, who have studied activation of EGFR signalling following stimulation of cells with gastrin-releasing peptide. They have demonstrated that Src is essential downstream of GPCR signalling to facilitate metalloproteinase-mediated amphiregulin release and EGFR activation (Zhang et al., 2004). Src was required for the GPCR-mediated activation of phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI-3K), which in turn led to activation of phosphatidyl inositol-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), which directly phosphorylated ADAM-17 (Zhang et al., 2006). It is possible that in some circumstances TMPS may not involve the ADAM cytoplasmic domain since as we saw previously, phorbol ester activation of ADAM-17 can occur \u2013 at least in transfected cells \u2013 in the absence of the cytoplasmic domain (Reddy et al., 2000). However this type of mechanism is appealing since it provides a way to build specificity into the GPCR-ADAM crosstalk. This also could provide insights into the functional significance of the cytoplasmic domain splice variants seen, for example, for ADAM15 (Zhong et al., 2008) and ADAM22 (Godde et al., 2006, Sagane et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) can be defined as a sequential proteolytic cascade that involves an initial ectodomain sheddase action on a transmembrane protein, followed by a subsequent cleavage within the membrane itself, which in many cases generates a signal-transducing intracellular domain fragment. The classical examples of regulated intramembrane proteolysis are Notch signalling and APP processing, which we have discussed in Section 1.3 in relation to the results from knockout mouse studies. These two processes are illustrated in Fig. 4, and further details can be found in Saftig and Hartmann, 2005, Tousseyn et al., 2006, Murphy et al., 2008. The number of proteins that are now known to be subject to RIPping is growing. Many of these are adhesion molecules and substrates of ADAM-10, though RIPping is likely to be a widespread phenomenon involving many ADAM sheddases. RIPping substrates include CD44 (Nagano et al., 2004), N-cadherin (Reiss et al., 2005), E-cadherin (Maretzky et al., 2005a) and L1 (Maretzky et al., 2005b). In each of these cases, as with the Notch paradigm, cleavage by the extracellular ADAM creates a truncated transmembrane stub that becomes accessible for cleavage by an intramembrane-cleaving protease (I-CLiP), of which four types are known: the presenilins (which are the proteolytic component of \u03b3-secretase), the signal peptide peptidases, S2P, and the rhomboids (Spasic and Annaert, 2008). In many instances these cleavages generate an intracellular domain (ICD) that moves off to the nucleus and influences gene transcription, as is the case for Notch (Fig. 4). For both N- and E-cadherin, cleavage leads to disruption of cell adhesion mediated by the extracellular domains, and a redistribution of \u03b2-catenin from the cell surface to the nucleus to activate target genes, leading to epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition in the case of E-cadherin (Maretzky et al., 2005a, Reiss et al., 2005). In addition the N-cadherin ICD is reported to act as a signal transducer by binding to the transcriptional coactivator CBP and inducing its proteasomal degradation (Marambaud et al., 2003).",

Cleavage of Delta by ADAM-10 had originally been considered to allow the ligand to diffuse to distant Notch receptors (Qi et al., 1999) but subsequently it was recognized that the released ligand was inactive, leading to the suggestion that this was a mechanism to allow spatial control of Notch signalling (Mishra-Gorur et al., 2002). However it was subsequently realized that the ADAM-10-mediated cleavage of Delta1 led to \u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of the transmembrane stub generating an ICD that translocated to the nucleus (Six et al., 2003). Thus this could represent the same bidirectional signalling that has been seen for the proteolysis of the ephrin-A5/EphA3 complex by ADAM-10 (Janes et al., 2005). The ICDs generated by RIPping may have multiple roles in cell signalling in addition to effects on transcription in the nucleus: for instance, the ICD generated by \u03b3-secretase action on ephrinB2 causes activation of Src by binding and inhibiting Csk, a kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits Src. Src in turn phosphorylates ephrinB2, preventing its cleavage by \u03b3-secretase and establishing a feedback loop (Georgakopoulos et al., 2006).",

Certainly ECM targets are included among lists of known substrates (Table 2), but in general this does not seem to be the major connection of these enzymes to cancer progression. That said, there are exceptions, as is the case for ADAM-9 which can cleave laminin and promote invasion (Mazzocca et al., 2005). ADAMs may directly modulate tumour cell adhesion in by interactions with integrins and proteoglycans as discussed in Sections 2.3, 2.4 (and see also (Arribas et al., 2006)). Isolated domains of ADAMs can have potent effects on these aspects of tumourigenesis, as evidenced by the antiangiogenic and anti-metastatic actions of the disintegrin domain of ADAM-15 (Trochon-Joseph et al., 2004); whether these effects are relevant to naturally occurring forms of these molecules is still unclear. Several studies have however linked ADAM-10 to cleavage of the adhesion molecules N-, E- and VE-cadherin (Maretzky et al., 2005a, Reiss et al., 2005, Schulz et al., 2008). These will have profound effects on tumour cell phenotype, resulting in altered patterns of adhesion and migration, and influence on downstream gene expression via activation of \u03b2-catenin signalling or direct effects of the RIPped intracellular domain. Likewise, the shedding of adhesion molecules such as Selectins, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, PECAM-1 by ADAMs will affect tumour cell adhesion to the vasculature. By ectodomain shedding ADAMs may mobilize growth factors, chemokines and other soluble mediators or influence signalling via cognate receptors as we have discussed in Section 3.2. This is particularly pertinent for ADAM-17 and EGFR signalling, where direct relationships between ADAM-17 and TGF\u03b1 have been clearly documented in human breast cancer (Borrell-Pages et al., 2003, Kenny and Bissell, 2007).",

            "text": "An important area of ADAM participation in normal and pathogenetic processes is their influence on inflammatory responses (reviewed by Garton et al., 2006, Ponnuchamy and Khalil, 2008, Murphy et al., 2008). Leukocyte recruitment in response to inflammatory stimuli is a multistep process that involves (1) rolling and tethering on the vascular endothelium, which is mediated by Selectins and their ligands; (2) activation and firm adhesion, which depends on chemokine activation of leukocyte integrins and their associations with vascular adhesion moledules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1; (3) locomotion to endothelial cell junctions, again dependent on leukocyte integrins and adhesion partners; and (4) diapediesis across the endothelial layer and basement membrane, which involves PECAM-1 and CD99 (Garton et al., 2006, Ponnuchamy and Khalil, 2008). L-selectin shedding by ADAMs affects the rolling of leukocytes across the endothelium such that blockade of shedding promotes leukocyte adhesion and activation (Hafezi-Moghadam and Ley, 1999). ADAM-mediated L-selectin shedding is necessary also to allow transendothelial migration (Faveeuw et al., 2001). Evidence points to involvement of ADAM-17 in shedding of L-selectin, ICAM-1 and V-CAM-1 (Garton et al., 2006) and ADAM-10 in cleavage of VE-cadherin, thereby enhancing vascular permeability and transmigration of leukocytes (Schulz et al., 2008). Moreover, both ADAM-10 and -17 process chemokines (see Table 2) which drive the activation process and facilitate chemoattraction. ADAM-17 controls TNF-\u03b1-mediated inflammation by regulating pro-TNF-\u03b1 activation and the shedding of TNFRs. The importance of TNFR shedding is highlighted by the discovery that the dominantly inherited chronic inflammatory disorder TNFR-associated periodic syndrome (TRAP) is caused by mutations that impair shedding of TNF-R1 (McDermott et al., 1999). Inflammation is essential for the body to cope with infectious agents, but excessive inflammation contributes to disease pathogenesis in arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of autoimmune conditions. Thus many of the disease connections of ADAMs may actually be underpinned by fundamental roles in inflammation.",

Linkage studies identified ADAM33 as a candidate asthma-susceptibility locus, and numerous polymorphisms were identified in both coding and non-coding regions, the latter suggestive of effects on splicing or transcriptional control (Van Eerdewegh et al., 2002). The function of ADAM-33 in asthma is currently unknown. It is expressed by smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts of the airway rather than inflammatory cells, and many splice variants have been reported, some of which omit the metalloproteinase domain (Powell et al., 2004). Thus its role may be in adhesion or via critical protein\u2013protein interactions. Notably ADAM8\u00b8 which is predominantly expressed by hematopoietic cells, is upregulated in inflammatory cells in an experimental allergen-induced model (King et al., 2004). Expression of both ADAM33 and ADAM8 increases in line with disease severity in bronchial samples from patients with asthma, consistent with roles in promoting disease progression (Foley et al., 2007).",

The reduced expression of ADAM-10 in neurons in AD brains compared to controls is consistent with a primary role for this enzyme (Bernstein et al., 2003). Conceivably, therapies could be envisaged that increase \u03b1-secretase levels and there is evidence to support positive effects of steroid hormones, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, metal ions and cholesterol lowering drugs (Allinson et al., 2003). However, the caveat is that we need to understand much more about the multifaceted roles of ADAMs in tissue homeostasis and their positive links with disease pathogenesis that are summarised in Table 7.",

            "text": "Our knowledge of the remarkable mammalian ADAM family has come a long way since the discovery of the first members as sperm-associated proteins in the early 1990s (Blobel, 1997). It is now clear that these proteases regulate cell phenotype and behaviour by ectodomain shedding and RIPping, and that separately from their proteolytic functions, many influence cell-cell communication via adhesive interactions. There are growing links with human diseases, many reflecting involvement in inflammatory processes, and ADAMs are thus attractive targets for novel therapies. There are several priority areas for future investigations. Firstly, we need more information on ADAM structure, and in particular the structure of full-length molecules. The recent crystallographic analysis of SVMPs have provided radical new insights into the topology of the molecules and how domains may act together to execute substrate docking and catalysis. In these new structures the disintegrin loop is buried and inaccessible, which raises questions about its role in protein\u2013protein interactions. Thus more knowledge of the post-translational processing of the ADAMs and the structures of these proteolytically cleaved or otherwise modified forms will unlock a wealth of mechanistic information. This information will also be valuable for the design of more selective inhibitors that might interfere with function via interactions with exosites involved in substrate recognition or protein\u2013protein interactions, rather than catalysis per se. A second and related issue is the need to understand the significance of variant form of the ADAMs that are produced by alternative splicing. As we have seen, many of these affect the cytoplasmic domain, and we need to look more closely at the how these domains may be involved in particular aspects of ADAM function such as regulated trafficking, interaction partner selection and coupling to signal transduction pathways. Thirdly, given the critical roles of many ADAMs in key developmental processes, use of conditional and inducible mouse knockouts in conjunction with disease models is essential. Finally, this review has not dealt extensively with the control of ADAM expression since very little is known at present. Though it is clear that several ADAMs are subject to transcriptional regulation (Worley et al., 2003), it is likely that control at this level may not be as significant as that of their relatives the MMPs (Clark et al., 2008) since there are already strong clues that post-transcriptional regulation is key, at least for ADAM17 (Santiago-Josefat et al., 2007). Thus the study of the roles of microRNAs in ADAM control may prove very revealing (Dalmay and Edwards, 2006).",
