However, for a number of other mucosal pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, HIV-1, herpes simplex virus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, this approach has not been successful. Alternative vaccination strategies that are directed at generating more robust mucosal immunity, including cellular responses1, have been proposed.",

            "text": "In this vein, a promising approach has been the focus on mucosal immunization strategies2\u20135. Following mucosal immunization, antigen-responsive T cells are activated in local draining lymph nodes. It is thought that activation in mucosa-associated lymph nodes leads to the expression of specific chemokine and adhesion receptors that facilitate selective access of effector T cells to mucosal tissue6, a process which may be enhanced by persistence of local antigen7. A subset of these recruited effector T cells can remain in the tissue and further differentiate into tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) that exhibit limited migratory potential8\u201310. These cells have the ability to respond rapidly to antigen re-challenge, thereby providing frontline immunity upon subsequent pathogen exposure11\u201314. Based on these observations, the development of vaccines that can elicit TRM at mucosal surfaces has become an area of active investigation. One of the mucosal surfaces that is first encountered by many pathogens is the nasopharynx. For instance, colonization of the nasal pharynx with pneumococcus is an obligate first step for invasive pathogenesis, but the role played by TRM in protecting the nasopharynx from colonization remains incompletely elucidated. Specifically, it has been shown that prior infection of the lung with an avirulent pneumococcal strain results in the formation of protective tissue-resident CD4+ T cells within the lung, but whether prior colonization of the nose with pneumococci induces the formation of protective anti-pneumococcal CD4+ TRM has not been previously determined.",

We have studied a killed pneumococcal whole cell preparation that elicits protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasopharyngeal challenge15\u201323. When delivered either intranasally (I.N.) with cholera toxin (CT) as an adjuvant, or subcutaneously (S.C.) with alum, killed pneumococci can elicit a multi-pronged immune response. This includes protein antigen-specific antibodies that protect against invasive disease, as well as IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells that protect against nasal colonization19\u201322, 24, 25. However, whether this vaccine induces CD4+ TRM in the nose and if so whether these are essential for protection of the nose from pneumococcal challenge remain to be determined. Further, it has been hypothesized that a significant advantage of mucosal immunization compared to parenteral administration might be the ability to generate mucosal TRM. However, the observation that the administration of killed pneumococci by S.C. injection mediates protection from nasal colonization raises the question of whether protection induced by this route of administration is also based on generation of mucosal TRM in the nasopharynx, potentially challenging the paradigm that generation of mucosal TRM requires mucosal vaccination.",

Further, we demonstrate that protective pneumococcal-responsive IL-17A+CD4+ TRM cells accumulate in the nose following either I.N. and S.C. administration of killed pneumococci. Finally, we show that nasal CD4+ TRM are essential for the recruitment of neutrophils necessary to limit colonization following nasal challenge of immunized mice. These data demonstrate that nasal CD4+ TRM can provide protection against nasal colonization with pneumococcus based on their ability to recruit neutrophils to the nasal mucosa. Potentially of greatest interest, these findings indicate that highly protective, long lasting mucosal TRM can be generated following parenteral vaccination, and thus have important implications for vaccine development.",

However the phenotype and location of the protective CD4+ T cell has not been determined. A protective role for CD4+ TRM at mucosal surfaces has recently been described for a number of bacterial pathogens of public health significance1, 2, 27. Exposure to live pneumococcus in the nasopharynx protects mice against subsequent homologous or heterologous pneumococcal challenge20, 21. Hence, we hypothesized that I.N. exposure to a pneumococcal strain (followed by clearance) would generate antigen-specific nasal CD4+ TRM that protect against subsequent pneumococcal colonization. To test this hypothesis, mice were exposed intranasally to live strain 0603 or PBS. One to two months later mice received APC-labeled anti-Thy 1.2 antibody by intravenous injection to discriminate between lymphocytes that were located intravascularly and those in the tissue parenchyma, and were then euthanized 5 minutes later. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from the nasal mucosa (NM), blood and spleen and evaluated by flow cytometry (gating strategies for the NM are shown in Supplementary Figure 1a).",

The majority of CD4+ T cells within the NM were also protected from labeling with the Thy1.2 antibody, demonstrating their location in an extravascular compartment. Interestingly, in mice exposed to PBS alone, the percent of protected CD4+ T cells that expressed markers associated with a memory phenotype (Tm, CD62LloCD44high) was considerably higher in the NM than the spleen (Fig. 1a and b), and further, the percent of CD4+ Tm that expressed markers associated with tissue residency (CD69 and CD11a) was significantly higher in the NM than the spleen (Fig. 1c and d). Remarkably, both the percent of nasal CD4+ Tm (Fig. 1a and b) and the proportion of these cells that expressed CD69 and CD11a was significantly higher in mice previously exposed to 0603 compared to mice exposed to PBS alone (Fig. 1c and d). Consistent with these observations, the absolute number of CD69+CD11a+ CD4+ Tm cells in the NM was significantly higher in 0603-exposed mice compared to na\u00efve mice (Fig. 1e) These results indicate that the majority of CD4+ Tm in the nose of na\u00efve mice are in fact TRM, and further that the density of these cells increases following pneumococcal exposure.",

To test this hypothesis, we vaccinated mice with WCV or CT intranasally and repeated one week later.

Finally, mice immunized I.N. with WCV and then treated with FTY720 prior to pneumococcal challenge also exhibited significantly higher density of both CD69+CD11a+ and IL-17A+CD4+ T cells and increased secretion of IL-17A in the nose compared to mice immunized with CT alone (and treated with FTY720).

However, having demonstrated that I.N.-administered WCV induces the accumulation of protective CD4+ TRM within the NM, we wondered whether parenteral immunization might do the same. To address this question, mice were immunized three times at bi-weekly intervals S.C. with alum alone or WCV, and 4 weeks later single cell suspensions were prepared from mucosal sites (the NM and colonic lamina propria), as well as the spleen. Interestingly, in addition to inducing increased numbers of CD69+CD11a+CD4+ Tm in the spleen, WCV induced significantly higher absolute numbers of CD69+CD11a+CD4+ Tm cells in both the colon and nasal mucosa compared to alum alone (Fig. 5a, and Supplemental Figure 5a), indicating that, unexpectedly, parenteral immunization with WCV induces the accumulation of CD4+ TRM at mucosal sites.",

Having shown that WCV-induced nasal CD4+ TRM provide protection against mucosal colonization, we wondered whether these TRM were sufficient to mediate neutrophil recruitment. To address this, histological sections prepared from the nasal cavity of mice from the groups described above in Figure 6a were stained with anti-CD4 and antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, and the absolute number of CD4+ T cells and neutrophils were enumerated. Mice that had been previously immunized with WCV demonstrated significantly higher numbers of both CD4+ T cells and neutrophils in the nasal mucosa following pneumococcal challenge than mice immunized with alum alone, and these differences in cell numbers remained in the presence of FTY720. In contrast, treatment with anti-CD4 antibody significantly reduced the number of both CD4+ T cell and neutrophil accumulation in mice immunized S.C. with WCV (Fig. 7a\u2013c). A potential caveat for this experiment is the limited sample size for the group treated with anti-CD4 antibody (n=5), although a small pilot experiment using mice immunized intranasally with WCV also demonstrated reduced neutrophil recruitment following treatment with anti-CD4 antibody (data not shown). Nontheless, these results indicate that WCV-induced neutrophil accumulation remains intact when recruitment of circulating effector T cells is blocked by FTY720, strongly suggesting nasal CD4+ TRM are sufficient to mediate both neutrophil recruitment and protection from nasal challenge.",

Furthermore, our data employing FTY720 as well as staining for markers associated with tissue-residency, strongly suggest that antigen-specific resident (rather than recruited) T cells are sufficient for protection. Although it is theoretically possible that FTY720 could be trapping circulating effector cells within the tissues and it is these trapped cells that mediate protection, our observation that the majority of antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells isolated from the NM exhibit markers associated with TRM make this possibility unlikely. Future experiments applying alternative approaches such as parabiosis will help further delineate these issues.",

For example, Zens and colleagues demonstrated that while FluMist administered to mice mucosally generated lung CD4+ TRM that provided heterosubtypic protection to influenza infection, such cells were not generated following parenteral administration of Fluzone, although in this study TRM generation was not evaluated in the nasopharynx30. In contrast, it has been suggested that the gut is permissive for T cell recruitment following parenteral immunization even in the absence of local stimulation6. Given that parenteral immunization with WCV was sufficient to generate antigen-specific TRM in the NM as well as the gut, we propose that the upper respiratory tract (URT) may also be permissive for T cell recruitment following parenteral immunization.",

CD8+ TRM can be generated in multiple tissues including the intestine, kidney and brain by antigen-independent mechanisms6, 10, 38, 39, and this process does not depend on commensal flora, dietary or cross-reactive antigens6, 40. Masopust and others have demonstrated that T cell migratory patterns can be dynamic during the early effector phase, allowing for seeding of effector cells in tissues beyond the original site of challenge10, 41\u201344 More recently Frederick and colleagues also implicated adjuvant choice as important for regulating homing of antigen specific CD4+ T cells to the gut after parenteral immunization45. Adjuvant selection may also be important for generating TRM in the nasopharynx. In support of this notion, Allen et al. recently demonstrated that the choice of adjuvant influenced the generation of CD4+ TRM in the lung following parenteral immunization with an acellular protein-based pertussis vaccine, although whether these lung CD4+ TRM were truly antigen-specific was not evaluated46. Hence, it could be postulated that there are unique properties of WCV combined with alum that lead to priming of CD4+ T cells within skin draining lymph nodes, which subsequently exhibit the ability to home broadly to mucosal sites. This is supported by our observation that S.C. administration of WCV with alum as an adjuvant induced antigen-responsive T cells in the colon, as well as in the nasopharynx. This finding, which could have been anticipated with CT (a well known potent driver of mucosal Th17 responses47), is more surprising for alum, which has not been previously associated with generation of TRM.",

            "text": "An alternative possibility to explain the generation of antigen-specific mucosal TRM following S.C. immunization with WCV is that priming is able to occur in mucosal draining lymph nodes, such as the cervical lymph node (CLN). This could be the result of either antigen alone or antigen-carrying antigen-presenting cells (APCs) migrating to the CLN. It has previously been suggested that CLN rather than nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) or spleen is the site of priming for antigen-specific Th17 cells generated following I.N. inoculation with Streptococcus pyogenes48. Furthermore, I.N. immunization with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine can provide protection against nasal colonization in infant mice in the absence of NALT but not in the absence of the CLN49, but whether there is priming of antigen-specific T cells within the CLN following S.C. immunization with WCV remains to be determined. The specific APC population involved in the uptake and presentation of antigen to cognate T cells at inductive sites can also be important for optimal generation of TRM50, and thus identifying APC\u2019s involved in generating TRM within the nasopharynx should be an important goal of future studies.",
