            "text": "The families Suidae (swine) and Tayassuidae (peccaries) are nonruminating ungulates belonging to the Suina clade or suborder within the order Artiodactyla.49 Fossil records show suids appearing around 35 million years ago (upper Eocene era) in the part of the world now known as Thailand.49 Of the family Suidae, Suinae is the only extant subfamily. The characteristics of suid molars have resulted in dividing the subfamily into different tribes.49 The Hippohyini originated in Asia and have hypsodont dentition. Swine species from Africa with hypsodont dentition are in the Phacocherini tribe. The Suini tribe comprises members of the genus Sus. The Potamochoerini tribe includes the genera Hylochoerus and Potamochoerus. Molecular studies of Babyrousa spp. have yielded conflicting results, with some placing them in a separate tribe, Babirusina. Depending on the source, 14 to 19 species of suids exist (Table 58-1\n).15, 32, 35, 49 Recent references have given species designation to the subspecies of Babyrousa babirussa.15, 49 The natural range of the Suidae family spans across Europe, Africa, Asia, and East Indies. Evidence to support any wild suids having originated in the Americas is lacking. They were introduced by humans into the Americas and into Australia, New Zealand, and New Guinea. Ancestors of extant peccaries are thought to have dispersed into the New World from eastern Asia. Currently, three species of peccary range from Southwestern United States to South America (Table 58-2\n).15, 28, 35, 49\n",

Despite their short limbs they are good runners and jumpers, and some are adept swimmers. Bornean bearded pigs have been recorded as swimming 45 kilometers (km), and babirusas have been observed swimming underwater.49 In general, wild suids and peccaries live in social groupings, although breeding males become solitary after the breeding season. Wild suid females and their offspring live in herds known as sounders. Suids are quite vocal, and peccaries make a characteristic clacking sound with their teeth. Wild suid and peccary populations are primarily threatened by habitat destruction through human encroachment and hunting.14, 35, 49 Isolated island populations are particularly susceptible.

The peccary has a piglike shape; however, the limbs are long and slender with small hooves. In addition, peccaries only have one dewclaw on the hindlimbs, and hindlimb dewclaws are generally lacking in Chacoan pecarries.49 Suid males are generally larger than females; however, little size dimorphism exists between sexes in peccaries.14, 32, 49 The pelage of wild suids varies from being sparse in the babirusa to being entirely covered with coarse bristly hair in the wild boar. Peccaries have a dense covering of long, coarse bristles, which makes it difficult to estimate body condition, especially during piloerection.",

This adaptation is thought to facilitate rooting behavior. The disklike shape of the snout, the terminally placed nostrils, which are capable of closing, and the presence of a prenasal bone within the cartilaginous disk of the snout are also adaptions for rooting behavior.32, 35, 49 The prenasal bone can be seen radiographically. Babirusas tend to root in soft, moist soils, hence their rostral bone is not as well developed as in other suids or is absent.35, 49 The rostrum of the Chacoan peccary is reported to have a more complex internal anatomy compared with other peccaries, and this is theorized to be an adaptation to living in dusty, xeric conditions.49\n",

The orientation of canines in several species allows these teeth to grow upward and outward and thus capable of inflicting serious damage. In most species, the tusks of the males are larger than those of the females except in the warthog, in which both sexes have large tusks. The babirusa is known for its peculiar tusk arrangement. The alveoli of the upper canines rotate during development such that these teeth grow upward through the rostrum and spiral caudally.49 The lower canines also grow in a spiral shape. Canines are markedly reduced or absent in female babirusas. In peccaries, canines point straight down, which allows interlocking. This arrangement facilitates stabilization of the jaw when the animal is cracking hard seeds between the other teeth.14, 49\n",

The opportunity to root and dig should be provided without disrupting the structural integrity of the enclosure. These behaviors may also result in damage to indoor facilities such as padded barn floors. Animals should be given access to mud wallows, where appropriate, and kept free from fecal and urine contamination. Nesting is a common behavior, and animals should be provided bedding materials for nesting. Other considerations for housing suids and peccaries include escape potential, substrate, and intraspecific aggression. Pigs are quite capable of either jumping (both vertically and horizontally) or digging their way out of an enclosure if given the opportunity. Substrate should not be abrasive as running, pacing, or both may cause excessive hoof wear, and enclosures should be evaluated for other potential sources of foot trauma. When running along chainlink fence lines animals may traumatize the lateral dewclaws. Usually, a dominance hierarchy in social groupings exists, hence visual barriers to help divert aggression are recommended. Animals should have access to shade and, depending on the climate, protection from harsh weather.",

Hylochoerus, Potomachoerus sp., Sus scrofa, Sus barbatus, and possibly the warty pigs have been considered more frugivorous.8, 24 The exact nutritional requirements of wild suids are not well-defined.24 In general, diets fed to wild suids and peccaries in captivity consist of a complete pelleted herbivore ration, with varying amounts of fruits, vegetables, browse, and hay. A study evaluated the apparent digestibility of different macronutrients in warthogs, red river hogs, warty pigs, and babirusa.8 No difference in protein digestibility was observed between the species, including peccaries when comparing with prior literature. Despite differences in gastric anatomy, neither peccaries nor babirusa had more efficient fiber digestion. Hemicellulose was digested more efficiently than cellulose by red river hogs, babirusas, and peccaries, whereas warthogs were capable of efficiently digesting both hemicellulose and cellulose.

Although exotic species do not have the genetic defect that causes malignant hyperthermia in domestic swine, they are quite susceptible to hyperthermia because of their inability to sweat and the likelihood of extreme muscle exertion during an immobilization, especially in escape scenarios.27 Excessive running, lengthy inductions, and violent recoveries are also risk factors for exertional myopathy. Foot trauma may also occur with excessive running on hard surfaces. When darting an animal in a group, precautions need to be taken to avoid causing trauma to conspecifics.",

If a stylet is used, precautions need to be taken so to avoid trauma to the larynx. Once within the larynx, the endotracheal tube should be rotated 180 degrees to reach the tracheal opening. Threading an endoscope through the endotracheal tube may facilitate passage into the trachea. Laryngospasm may also complicate intubation. The use of benzodiazepines has been noted to significantly reduce jaw tone, which may facilitate easier intubation. In peccaries, however, intubation is generally not difficult, as the mouth can be opened widely to gain adequate access to the larynx and a more direct path exists from the epiglottis into the trachea.

A nylon screw was used to successfully cap a tooth defect in a babirusa.38 Sites of tusk avulsions generally granulate with wound care and antimicrobial therapy. Some animals may need periodic tusk trimming. Dental attrition and uneven wear are expected findings in aging suids and peccaries (Figure 58-5\n). Some species in the wild have been noted to only have canines and caudal molars.32 Floating dental points is performed, as needed. Periodontal disease is managed through regular prophylaxis, dental extractions, as needed, and antimicrobial therapy. Pulsatile low-dose doxycycline (0.3 mg/kg, PO, BID, for 1\u20133 months, rotating on and off therapy) has been used for adjunct management of periodontal disease in suids and tassysuids.4 Diets high in simple sugars may predispose these animals to periodontal disease.

Some animals may need periodic hoof trims, depending on the substrate used and activity levels (Figure 58-6\n). Excessive sole wear and hoof trauma may occur from digging, running, or pacing on hard or abrasive surfaces (Figure 58-7, A and B\n). Any lame suid or peccary should be carefully monitored and examined if lameness does not resolve within a few days. If left untreated, sole erosions and hoof defects may progress to infection of soft tissues and osteomyelitis. Hoof acrylics may be used to repair defects once the tissue has become healthy (Figure 58-8\n). Vettec hoof care products (Vettec Hoof Care Products, Oxnard, CA, www.vettec.com) are commonly used at the author's institution. Hoof acrylics are also used prophylactically to create protective toe caps when the animals are likely to pace excessively (e.g., during relocations). These products have also been used on the bottoms of bandages to extend bandage wear. Behavioral conditioning to facilitate inspection of feet is helpful to monitor hoof conditions.",
