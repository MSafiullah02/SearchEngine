            "text": "The freshwater Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis Milne Edwards, is an economically important species cultured in China during the last 10 years. Culture areas have increased rapidly in inland provinces of China. However, with the development of intensive culture, various diseases have appeared and severely affected crab production. Among these, \u00d4black gill syndrome\u00d5 (BGS) has caused important economic losses since 1996, particularly in the main culture provinces in China such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Shanghai. Another major sign of the disease resembles a respiratory problem. Thus, the disease is often called \u00d4sighs disease\u00d5 (SD) by farmers, because sounds reminiscent of sighs can be clearly heard from affected crabs, caused by slow extrusion of bubbles at night. Sluggishness and anorexia are other non-specific signs. During investigations on this disease we found a virus developing in connective tissue cells showing the general properties of the Roniviridae and designated it EsRNV for \u00d4E. sinensis ronivirus\u00d5. We report here histological investigations, viral ultrastructure and some genomic features of this new crab virus.",

The signs of SD were noted in about 30% of infected animals, however, under laboratory conditions, experiments failed to reproduce BGS. We consider the black gill may be a secondary sign caused by environmental factors after the crabs have been stressed by the viral infection. Naturally infected animals do not all exhibit BGS, and EsRNV was not the only pathogen found in diseased animals. In another farm, a DNA virus in the R-cells of the HP and a proteo-like bacterium were isolated in crabs exhibiting BGS, but were present in only 10% of sampled animals (data not shown). It is not certain that EsRNV is the causal agent of BGS, but the virus is undoubtedly very common in cultured crabs in inland China. EsRNV does appear to be the aetiological agent of SD as the virus was transmitted by inoculation and the clinical signs were reproduced.",
