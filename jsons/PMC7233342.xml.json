Written informed consent was waived owing to the observational design of the study and the urgent need to collect data for this infectious disease. The clinical charts of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICU were reviewed. The patients received invasive mechanical ventilation and met the criteria for ARDS (Berlin definition) (5), were under continuous infusion of sedatives, and were assessed for respiratory mechanics, including lung recruitability, during the week of February 18, 2020. This week (a 6-d observational window) was selected in order for the clinical team to record these additional measurements in the chart.",

Prone positioning was performed over periods of 24 hours when PaO2/FiO2 was persistently lower than 150 mm Hg. Flow, volume, and airway pressure were measured by ventilators (SV300; Mindray). Circuit leakage was excluded through a 6-second end-inspiratory occlusion. Measurements were performed at clinically set PEEP levels and were repeated every morning during the observation days, when possible. Total PEEP and plateau pressure were measured by a short end-expiratory and an end-inspiratory occlusion, respectively. Complete airway closure was assessed by performing a low-flow (6 L/min) inflation and by comparing patients' compliance with circuit compliance as previously described (6). The potential for lung recruitment was assessed by means of the R/I ratio (4), which can be calculated automatically from a webpage (https://crec.coemv.ca). Because of the limited access to computers or the internet while under airborne precautions, one of the authors (L.C.) provided a compact form for calculating the R/I ratio manually. In patients without airway closure,R/I ratio=VTeH\u2192L\u2212VTeHVTi\u00d7PplatL\u2212PEEPLPEEPH\u2212PEEPL\u22121where VteH\u2192L indicates the Vt exhaled from high to low PEEP during the single-breath maneuver, VteH is the exhaled Vt at high PEEP, Vti is the preset inspiratory Vt, PplatL is the plateau pressure at low PEEP, and PEEPh and PEEPl denote high and low PEEP, respectively. In patients with airway closure, the low PEEP was replaced with the measured airway opening pressure when the airways were reopened above the airway closure (6).",

The patients had severe disease and on average had 22 cm H2O of driving pressure despite using 6 ml/kg Vt. Although we were not able to compare the recruitability measured by the R/I ratio with that assessed by another technique (e.g., computed tomography), the low R/I ratio at Day 1 seemed consistent with the clinical impression of the clinicians. Of note, these patients had received various durations of noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and it would have been ideal to obtain these measurements as soon as the patients were intubated. The surprising finding that alternating body position is followed by increased lung recruitability is interesting but needs to be confirmed. The improvement in oxygenation with prone positioning was not statistically significant but seemed to be clinically relevant. Three patients received both prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which may also affect lung recruitability (7).",
