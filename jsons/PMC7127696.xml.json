CVB is also associated with a wide variety of other diseases, including diabetes, common cold, cardiomyopathy, neurological disorders and inflammation.3 Outbreaks of CVB occur annually throughout the world. Several synthetic molecules have been reported to be selective inhibitors of enteroviruses, and some of these have entered into clinical trials.4, 5, 6, 7 Unfortunately, neither of these investigational compounds has been formally approved for the treatment of acute enteroviral (including Coxsackie virus) infections.",

Delavirdine (I), arbidol (II) and methisazone (III) (Fig. 1\n) are indole derived marketed drugs that have been used to treat viral diseases. Arbidol is an influenza virus inhibitor which is marketed in Russia, China and a few other countries. It was reported to have a wide spectrum of antiviral activity against a number of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in addition to influenza viruses.8 For instance, arbidol was found to exhibit potent inhibitory activity against CVB3 and CVB5.3, 9 Another indole compound, N-methylisatin-\u03b2-thiosemicarbazone, methisazone, was used in the preventive treatment of smallpox after 1962. Based on in vitro studies, the antiviral spectrum of methisazone appears to include diverse DNA and RNA viruses.10, 11 A series of investigations on isatin-\u03b2-thiosemicarbazones revealed their antiviral properties against various virus types, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV),12 Moloney leukemia virus,13 Japanese encephalitis virus14 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).15 In a recent report by Zhang et al.,16 an isatin-\u03b2-hydrazone derivative (encoded ID45) was described as a promising antiviral agent against CVB3. Broad antiviral in vitro activity that includes CVB217 or CVB418 was further reported for some 2,3,5-trisubstituted indole derivatives synthesized by Giampieri et al.17 and isoindolylureas synthesized by Verma et al.18 Another class are indole-2-carboxamide derivatives, some of which were revealed to have promising antiviral properties during the past decade. Compounds with this scaffold were found to inhibit the replication of neurotropic alphavirus,19 HIV-1,20 HIV-1 wild type or drug-resistant mutant strains, and CVB4.21 Another relevant scaffold is the 4-thiazolidinone substructure, which is present in several small synthetic molecules endowed with in vitro antiviral characteristics.22, 23, 24\n",

The carbocyclic indole carbons which explicitly showed the 13C\u201319F couplings of the 5-fluoro indole core were observed as separate doublets with characteristic coupling constants related to the ipso, ortho, meta and para positions and allowed definite positional assignment of the C3, C3a, C4-7 and C7a carbons of 6 and 7. Cross peaks observed in the HMBC spectrum of compound 6c enabled the definite assignment of CO (\u03b4 161.93\u2013162.04 ppm) and CS (\u03b4 181.96\u2013182.93 ppm) carbons of the thiosemicarbazide analogs, 6a\u20136g.

This effect, observed in two different cell lines (HeLa and Vero; Table 1\n), was quite strong since the antiviral EC50 values were in the range of 0.4\u20132.1 \u03bcg/mL, and the values for the selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic to antivirally effective concentration; see values between square brackets in Table 1) were between 9 and 56. Compound 6b (with an ethyl substituent) was slightly more potent than the analogs carrying a methyl (6a), propyl (6c) or allyl (6d) moiety; this is also visible from the dose\u2013response curves shown in Figure 2\n. Besides, 6b, 6c and 6d also inhibited the replication of two other RNA viruses, Sindbis virus and respiratory syncytial virus, although these EC50 values were higher compared to those noted for Coxsackie B4 virus. Of note, the analogs carrying a larger butyl (6e) or aromatic (6f and 6g) substituent at the R position were devoid of this antiviral activity. The crucial role of the free thiosemicarbazide moiety was evident from the fact that their cyclized analogs, 4-thiazolidinones (7a\u20137g), did not produce any antiviral effect.",
