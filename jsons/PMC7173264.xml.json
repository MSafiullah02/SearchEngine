            "text": "Several large DNA and RNA viruses have been cloned as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), including poxviruses (Domi and Moss, 2002), herpesviruses [e.g., Epstein-Barr virus, (Delecluse et al., 1998), human and mouse cytomegaloviruses Borst et al., 1999, Messerle et al., 1997, pseudorabies virus (Smith and Enquist, 2000), herpes simplex virus 1 Horsburgh et al., 1999b, Saeki et al., 1998, Stavropoulos and Strathdee, 1998], and coronaviruses [e.g., transmissible gastroenteritis (Almazan et al., 2000)]. A major utility of constructing such recombinant viral BACs is the resulting ease with which the viral genome can be manipulated with prokaryotic genetic techniques to construct recombinant viruses. For example, essential and nonessential virus genes can be rapidly identified without construction of complementing cell lines (Brune et al., 1999). Furthermore, because all manipulations are performed as DNA clones in a prokaryotic system, the chance of isolating a recombinant genome with unrelated mutations should be reduced. Since the mutated genome exists as a DNA clone, sequence analysis of recombinants is facilitated and plaque purification of the resulting recombinant virus is not required.",

In theory, a BAC containing the entire genome of a nonreplicating virus could be used to deliver almost the entire spectrum of viral genes as a DNA vaccine. Such an approach using a nonreplicating HSV-1 BAC has recently been described (Suter et al., 1999). However, the future of DNA vaccines is still not clear. While DNA vaccines have shown promise in animal studies, their utility in humans is yet to be proven. Nevertheless, DNA vaccines, particularly those expressing numerous antigens to elicit a broad immune response that mimics natural infection, may have a role in new generation vaccines, possibly as part of novel prime-boost combinations using other vectors.",

Most of the advantages (e.g., good immunogenicity and stimulation of humoral and cellular immunity) and disadvantages (e.g., safety concerns and potential virus latency or persistence) of live virus vaccines are well known. Maintenance of live virus vaccines as DNA in the form of a BAC would offer additional advantages to the generation and production of live virus vaccines. A major advantage, as noted above, is that construction of new-generation virus vaccines would be facilitated. In addition, viral vaccine stocks could be re-derived as necessary by transfection of BAC DNA into new qualified cell lines, thus eliminating concerns regarding potential contamination or undocumented virus seed history. Finally, if viral vaccines could be produced and delivered as DNA, concerns about the cell substrates used for vaccine production, including tumorigenicity and the presence of unknown adventitious agents, could be eliminated.",

Chloramphenicol-resistant colonies obtained from each of the two original virus recombinants were selected and analyzed for the presence of BeloBAC and HSV-2 sequences. HSV2-BAC DNA from two independent clones, derived from the two independent virus recombinants, was analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis and Southern blotting to verify the structure of the HSV2-BAC and the insertion of the BeloBAC11 sequences into the thymidine kinase (tk) gene (Fig. 2)\n.

Insertion of the 7400-bp BeloBAC sequence (containing a single XhoI site) followed by digest with XhoI results in tk- and BeloBAC-positive fragments of approximately 4300 and 9200 bp (Figs. 2A and B, lanes 1 and 3).

            "text": "To determine the feasibility of immunization using DNA from the HSV2-BAC, we delivered HSV2-BAC DNA by gene gun and compared the immune response to live virus immunization. Four groups of mice were immunized with either 1 \u03bcg of HSV2-BAC DNA, 5 \u00d7 104 pfu of HSV2-BAC virus, 5 \u00d7 102 pfu of HSV2-BAC virus, or 1 \u03bcg of control DNA (pBeloBAC). Serum samples were obtained 3 weeks later and analyzed for the presence of HSV-2 specific antibody (Fig. 4A)\n. A single inoculation with 1 g of HSV2-BAC DNA resulted in a readily detectable HSV-2 specific IgG response in all animals, as did inoculation with 5 \u00d7 104 pfu of virus. Only two of five animals inoculated one time with the lower dose of virus responded with detectable HSV-2 specific IgG. Three weeks after immunization, each group of animals was boosted with the same dose of DNA or virus as received in the first immunization; sera were again collected 3 weeks later. After the second immunization with either DNA or virus, all mice in each vaccinated group sero-converted and an increase in the mean IgG titer in each group was observed. There was a relatively large variability in the specific HSV-2 antibody response in the group receiving the lower dose of HSV2-BAC virus, likely reflecting the poor initial response in three of the five animals. Further analysis of the sera obtained after two immunizations with either HSV2-BAC DNA or 5 \u00d7 104 pfu of HSV2-BAC virus revealed high titers of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b in both groups, indicating a broad humoral immune response to both types of immunization (Fig. 4B). HSV-2 specific IgG3 was detectable in all five animals in the HSV2-BAC DNA-immunized group, but in only two of the five animals in the virus-immunized group. In addition, sera obtained after two immunizations with either HSV2-BAC DNA or 5 \u00d7 104 pfu of HSV2-BAC virus were capable of neutralizing HSV-2 in vitro [3.06\u00b10.30 and 2.11\u00b10.51 (P = 0.007), mean 50% neutralization titers (log 10), respectively]. Finally, mice immunized with HSV2-BAC DNA survived a lethal challenge of HSV-2 (five of five) as did 80% (four of five; P = 1.00) of the animals receiving the higher dose of HSV2-BAC virus (Fig. 5)). In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, three of five animals in the group receiving the lower dose and one mouse in the group receiving the higher dose of HSV2-BAC virus succumbed to virus challenge. These animals had the lowest HSV-specific IgG antibody levels after two immunizations in their respective groups (data not shown). The three animals in the low-dose group were the same animals without a detectable HSV antibody after one immunization, suggesting a rough correlation between antibody response and protection against lethal challenge. Taken together, these analyses indicated that gene gun delivery of HSV2-BAC DNA elicited strong HSV-specific antibody responses and substantial protection against lethal challenge, equivalent to or greater than live virus immunization.",

Such recombinant HSV-2 genomes might find use as newer generation live virus vaccines. We investigated the ease of HSV2-BAC manipulation by constructing a replication-incompetent genome that was missing the essential glycoprotein D gene. This allowed us to determine the feasibility of BAC immunization with a replication-incompetent HSV-2 virus, and also investigate the immunogenicity of HSV-2 in the absence of one of the major immunodominant viral antigens. For deletion of the HSV-2 gene, we constructed a gene replacement plasmid vector which contained approximately 2 kb of DNA sequences upstream of the gD-coding region linked to approximately 2 kb of sequences immediately downstream of the gD-coding region. The gD sequences target the vector to the gD region of the HSV2-BAC for deletion of the gD-coding region. In addition, the replacement vector contains a temperature-sensitive origin of replication and marker genes for positive and negative selection during the BAC mutagenesis procedure as described previously Horsburgh et al., 1999a, Horsburgh et al., 1999b. The absence of the gD gene in the mutagenized HSV2-BAC was confirmed by PCR analysis (see Materials and methods). The resulting HSV2 gD-BAC was not infectious when the DNA was transfected into Vero cells (<4 pfu/ml per gram of transfected DNA), but was infectious when transfected into a Vero cell line (VD60) that expresses HSV-1 gD (data not shown). These results verified the genotype and the resulting phenotype of the replication-incompetent HSV2 gD-BAC.",

The potential applications are numerous and include basic studies of viral pathogenesis, gene identification and characterization, and the development of new viral vectors and vaccines. Effective vaccines are not available for herpes simplex virus 2, the principal causative agent of genital herpes. Furthermore, it is not certain whether a successful vaccine against HSV-2 can be developed, nor is it clear what type of vaccine approach (e.g., live attenuated, subunit, DNA) is most likely to be successful. With these considerations, we reasoned that the advantages of BAC technology could be beneficial for multiple types of HSV-2 vaccine studies, including construction of attenuated virus strains, DNA vaccine evaluation, and the characterization of the contribution of individual viral genes to the generation of protective immunity.",

            "text": "To construct an HSV-2 bacterial artificial chromosome, we followed a procedure similar to that described for construction of an HSV-1 BAC (Horsburgh et al., 1999b). Insertion of the BeloBAC11 sequence into the HSV-2 thymidine kinase gene allowed for selection of the recombinant virus in the presence of acyclovir, followed by isolation of circular DNA that could be recovered by bacterial transformation. This procedure resulted in an HSV-2 with a thymidine kinase negative phenotype. While thymidine kinase is necessary for viral virulence and thus important for viral pathogenesis studies, it is also a target of antiviral drugs such as acyclovir or ganciclovir and thus would be an important safety feature in any live attenuated herpesvirus vaccine. The HSV2-BAC constructed in the present study is not envisioned as a vaccine for HSV-2 per se, but rather is used to demonstrate the feasibility of HSV-2 BAC immunization and the utility of an HSV-2 BAC for further manipulation of the viral genome. Before any HSV vaccine can be effectively evaluated as a vaccine, a thorough characterization of its ability to induce cellular as well as humoral immunity would be necessary, and its protective capabilities in multiple relevant animal models would need to be assessed. In addition, any live HSV-2 virus considered for use as a vaccine would require a demonstrated attenuated phenotype, extensive characterization of the BAC genome including sequence analysis of the genomic termini, reduced or impaired ability to establish and be reactivated from latency, and a functional thymidine kinase gene (for safety reasons). Such targeted manipulations of the viral genome to confer attenuation and impair reactivation from latency could easily be incorporated into a candidate vaccine through BAC mutagenesis for preclinical studies; a thymidine kinase negative BAC virus could be repaired by insertion of an intact thymidine kinase gene at another location in the genome in a relatively straightforward procedure. There have been recent reports that describe alternative sites for insertion of the BAC vector sequences including the intergenic region between the UL3 and UL4 genes of HSV-1 (Tanaka et al., 2003). In addition, methods have been described that allow the removal of BAC vector sequences from herpesvirus BACs Smith and Enquist, 2000, Tanaka et al., 2003, Wagner et al., 1999. Clearly, the availability of full-length infectious clones of herpesviruses such as HSV-2, and the techniques for their manipulation, provide powerful tools for the development of new generation vaccines.",

While we did not formally demonstrate that the HSV2-BAC DNA was infectious following in vivo delivery, infectious virus was readily produced following in vitro delivery by transfection, with approximately 105 pfu of virus being produced following transfection of 1 \u03bcg of BAC DNA. Since it is difficult to determine the amount of virus produced by in vivo delivery of HSV2-BAC DNA and it is not clear that in vivo delivery of DNA is as efficient as in vitro transfection, we compared in vivo delivery of 1 \u03bcg of BAC DNA to two concentrations of HSV2-BAC virus, 5 \u00d7 104 and 5 \u00d7 102 pfu. High levels of HSV-specific IgG antibody responses were elicited by both HSV2-BAC DNA immunization and the higher dose of virus inoculation [5.15 and 4.07 (P = 0.016), respectively]. Similarly, good neutralizing antibody responses were produced after immunization, and the antibody isotype responses elicited in each group were qualitatively similar. Some caution should be observed in evaluation of the significance of the antibody titers and neutralization titers between the DNA- and the virus-infected animals. Clearly, there is a dose response effect that is dependent on the amount of live virus given for immunization (Fig. 4A), and it is very likely that a further increase in the dose of virus would have produced even higher levels of specific antibody. We also have not attempted a dose-ranging study with the HSV2-BAC DNA. Most importantly, the results indicated that HSV2-BAC DNA was strongly immunogenic and suggested the feasibility of virus immunization by DNA delivery.",

Further, deletion of an immunodominant antigen such as gD would provide a rigorous test of the potential immunogenicity of BAC DNA. Elimination of the essential HSV-2 gD gene was relatively straightforward and did not require prior construction of a complementing cell line. However, a Vero cell line expressing the HSV-1 gD was utilized to verify the gD-negative phenotype and to produce gD-negative virus stocks. Because of the difficulty in constructing cell lines expressing sufficient levels of multiple complementing genes, BAC mutagenesis procedures are therefore especially useful for mutagenesis and isolation of viral genomes containing multiple disabling mutations.",

An HSV-1 antibody response was detected after one gene gun immunization of BAC DNA, and increased after a second and third immunization; neutralizing antibody was detected after two immunizations. Like our HSV2 gD-BAC, the fHSV pac should replicate and produce noninfectious virus-like particles. The fHSV pac on the other hand should express the entire complement of HSV-1 genes including HSV-1 gD. It is somewhat difficult to compare the relative protective capacities and immune responses elicited by the packaging defective HSV-1 BAC and the replication-competent and -incompetent HSV-2 BACs described in our study. In the HSV-1 study, BAC immunization is compared to an HSV-1 gH-deletion virus. In our HSV-2 study, we have compared HSV-2 BAC DNA immunization to replicating virus generated from the BAC clone and to an HSV-2 gD-deletion BAC.

Nonetheless, the immune response to HSV is complex and directed to many viral antigens in addition to gD.

If delivery of live virus via BAC DNA proved to be practical, technical problems associated with poor growth and yields of mutated virus even on a complementing cell line could be circumvented. Of course, issues associated with the large-scale production of BAC DNA would have to be addressed. Further, there are obvious advantages conferred by maintenance of novel viral vaccine stocks as BAC DNA and bacterial stocks containing the recombinant BAC.

Clones were confirmed by PCR with three independent HSV-2 specific primer pairs and a primer pair amplifying a fragment in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene. Electrocompetent RR1 cells harboring the HSV-2 BAC were prepared as previously described (Ausubel et al., 1987). Electrocompetent RR1 cells containing the HSV2-BAC were electroporated with 10 ng of pKO5.2-C.1-gD5678 DNA, and plated onto chloramphenicol/zeocin (Cam/Zeo) plates in serial dilutions at 30 \u00b0C. The following day, multiple colonies were picked into 1 ml of LB broth and plated in serial dilutions onto Cam/Zeo plates at 43 \u00b0C. Colonies at 43 \u00b0C were analyzed by picking several into 1 ml LB each and immediately plating out 10 and 100 \u03bcl onto sucrose/chloramphenicol (Suc/Cam) plates at 30 \u00b0C. Approximately 10 colonies from each plate, representing an original 43 \u00b0C colony, were transferred to grids on Suc/Zeo and Cam LB plates at 30 \u00b0C. Colonies which grew on Cam plates but not on Zeo/Suc, (i.e., Cam+, Zeo/Suc\u2212 ) were picked into 100 \u03bcl of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 for colony PCR using HSV-2 specific primers along with a primer pair flanking the gD-coding region. Positive colonies were streaked out onto Cam plates and grown at 37 \u00b0C. Clones were grown in Cam-LB media for glycerol stocks and subsequent large preparations of HSV2 gD-BAC DNA using the Large Construct kit (Qiagen Inc.).",
