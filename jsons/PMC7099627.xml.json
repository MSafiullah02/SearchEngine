Fluorescence was measured in a Polarstar Omega fluorometer using appropriate filters (540 nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelength). Percentage survival was determined by dividing fluorescence values obtained in the compound containing wells by values obtained for control wells containing cells incubated with a dilution series of DMSO (1, 0.5, 0.25%) and multiplying this value by 100. The IC50 was defined as the lowest concentration of compound tested at which at least 50% cell viability was observed.",

Most of the compounds displayed good antiplasmodial activities, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. The antiplasmodial activities of synthesized scaffolds depended on the nature of the substituent at the C4/C5 positions of the isoindoline-1,3-dione as well as on the length of the alkyl chain (n) introduced as a spacer. Analyzing the SAR among 4a\u2013d (R = piperidyl, C4), an increase in chain length resulted in improvement in antiplasmodial activities, with compounds 4c (n = 4) and 4d (n = 6) with IC50s of 0.05 and 0.075 \u03bcM, respectively. Changing the position of piperidine from C4 to C5 on the isoindoline-dione did not influence their antiplasmodial activities, as evidenced by compounds 4e\u2013h, with activities comparable with those of 4a\u2013d. Replacing the piperidine with morpholine at the C4 position resulted in enhancement of activities, with compound 4l (n = 6) displaying an IC50 of 0.025 \u03bcM. The shifting of the morpholine ring from the C4 to C5 position further improved activity, with compound 4p exhibiting an IC50 of 0.019 \u03bcM. The introduction of hydroxyethyl-piperazine substituents on isoindoline-dione resulted in activities independent of the length of the spacer, as evidenced by 4r, 4s and 4t. Compound 4r, with an optimum combination of hydroxyethyl-piperazine at the C5 position and a propyl chain as a spacer, proved to be the most potent among the series, with an IC50 of 0.006 \u03bcM (Figure 1).",

The heme inhibition occurs via \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interactions of the quinoline ring with the porphyrin ring of FPIX. Considering the promising antiplasmodial activities of the synthesized series of compounds, we carried out heme-binding studies of the most active scaffold to decipher its mechanism of action [32]. In order to rationalize the binding mode, the interaction of 4r with hemin chloride was studied via spectrophotometric titrations at pH 7.4 (physiological pH) and 5.6 (approximate pH in the food vacuole of the parasite). Small increments of 4r (0\u201318 mM, 40% DMSO) were added stepwise into a constant concentration of monomeric heme (12 \u03bcM) at physiological pH (0.02 M HEPES buffer in aqueous DMSO at pH 7.4) and acidic pH (0.02M MES buffer in aqueous DMSO at pH 5.6), resulting in a substantial decrease in intensity of the Fe(III) PPIX Soret band at 401 nm, with no shift in the absorption maximum (Figures 3 & 4). Solvent (DMSO) had no effect on the binding of 4r with heme at either pH used in this experiment (Supplementary Figure 8). The binding constants (Table 2) were calculated by analyzing the titration curves using HypSpec, a nonlinear least-squares fitting program. Titrations of CQ with heme were performed under identical conditions, and binding constants were calculated for comparison purposes (Supplementary Figure 6\u20137). The binding constants for the complexes formed between monomeric heme and 4r were comparable with those of the standard antimalarial drug CQ at physiological and acidic pH (Table 2).",

Among the synthesized compounds, 4r with an optimum combination of a propyl-chain as a linker and hydroxyethyl piperazine as the cycloalkyl amine was the most active with IC50 0.006 \u03bcM and a selectivity index >4200. The primary mode of action of these compounds appears to be binding with heme, as evident from heme-binding studies, further corroborated with NMR and high-resolution mass spectrum of the complex. The interaction energy of the diprotonated form of 4r(p) with heme models along with its favorable logP value could be the reason for its observed activity in comparison with that of CQ.",
