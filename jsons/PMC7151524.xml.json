Two researchers distributed the questionnaire to participants during the conference. The researchers used G-Power 3.1.3 to calculate the sample size. The effect of multiple regression analysis was under the condition of a medium effect size of 0.15, a significance level of 0.05, power of 0.90, and a total of 15 independent variables. The data collection was performed with 230 ICNs, considering the dropout rate based on the least sample size (199 samples). An institutional review board approved the study.",

Responses to 20 questions on nursing organizational culture were measured using a tool in Korean developed by Kim, Han, and Kim.8 This 5-point Likert-type scale survey consisted of relation-oriented culture, task-oriented culture, innovation-oriented culture, and hierarchy-oriented culture. The higher the score for each culture type, the more strongly one recognizes that culture. Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.88 in Kim et al,8 and 0.78 in this study. Job stress includes any kind of job-related stress and was measured with a tool developed by Parker and DeCotiis.9 Using the tool's 5-point Likert-type scale, the higher the score, the higher the stress level. Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.78 in the Parker and DeCotiis\u2019 study,9 and 0.93 in this study. Turnover intention is defined as the intention of members to voluntarily leave the organization. This study used tools developed by Lowler,10 modified and supplemented for nurses by Shin and Cho.11 Responses were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale: the higher the score, the higher the turnover intention. Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.88 in Shin and Cho,11 and 0.79 in this study.",
