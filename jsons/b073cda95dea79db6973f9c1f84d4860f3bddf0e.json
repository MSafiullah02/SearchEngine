In the current study, episodes of symptomatic respiratory infection with or without virus identification were similar with regard to bacterial colonization, suggesting that virus may be present even when undetected. Furthermore, the frequency of bacterial colonization observed during asymptomatic viral infection, especially for S. pneumoniae, was nearly of the same magnitude as that observed when children were symptomatic. These observations provide important insights into the pathogenesis of the bacterial complications of URTI, particularly in patients without respiratory symptoms. Further investigations that determine the precise mechanism of virus-bacterial interaction are needed.
