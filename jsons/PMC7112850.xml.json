However, recent findings suggest that the recombination between co-circulating CV-A16 and EV71 (Yip et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2010) may have contributed to the increase of HFMD cases in China over the past few years (Zhang et al., 2009). Furthermore, CV-A16 infection is not always benign, as fatal cases associated with the virus have been reported (Cooper et al., 1989, Wang et al., 2004). Thus, further understanding of the virology and epidemiology of CV-A16 is important for developing improved diagnostic tests and vaccines.",

            "text": "A serum neutralizing antibody response is the major indicator of EV71 or CV-A16 infection and protective immunity and, thus, is used to evaluate vaccine efficacy for HFMD. The neutralization assay based on inhibition of cytopathic effects (CPE) is a standard method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for measuring neutralizing antibodies against polioviruses and also has been applied widely to determine neutralizing antibody titers against CV-A16 and EV71 (Chang et al., 2002, Kung et al., 2007). However, the conventional CV-A16 neutralization assay (cCNA) is labor-intensive, subjective and time-consuming (at least 4 days). Therefore, it is not suitable for mass screening of protective antibodies in seroepidemiological studies. Recently, simplified neutralization assays employing pseudoviruses have been applied in detection of neutralizing antibodies against multiple enveloped viruses, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus (SARS-coV) (Temperton et al., 2005, Kobinger et al., 2007, Wright et al., 2008), hepatitis C virus (Bartosch et al., 2003, Keck et al., 2005, Netski et al., 2005), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Montefiori, 2005) and rabies (Wright et al., 2008). However, packaging signals are poorly understood for non-enveloped viruses such as CV-A16, making it thus far difficult to package pseudoviral particles for detection of neutralizing antibodies in human serum.",

The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme (Rib) was added downstream of the 3\u2032 NTR, followed by the T7 terminator (TT7) (Troupin et al., 2010). After transfection of this plasmid into 293T cells, the T7 RNA pol expressed by pcDNA3.1-T7 RNA Pol drives the transcription of the CV-A16 mRNA from the first nucleotide (T) of the 5\u2032 end to the last nucleotide (A) of the 3\u2032 end after ribozyme cleavage. Although this plasmid carries only a T7 promoter and no additional eukaryotic promoter sequences, spontaneous formation of pseudoparticles was observed after trans-encapsidation by P1 capsid proteins resulting from co-transfection with the VR1012-5\u2032 NTR-P1 and pcDNA3.1-T7 RNA Pol plasmids (Fig. 1\n).",

With the threshold value of 20% CV-A16-luc infectivity, a good correlation was observed between the neutralizing antibody titers determined by cCNA and pCNA (R\n2\n = 0.7689) (Fig. 5\n).

Thus, it seems likely that these three samples had extremely low titers to CV-A16 and that the pCNA was more sensitive than the cCNA. This assumption was also supported by the observation that the neutralizing antibody titers measured using the pCNA were higher than those measured by the cCNA (Fig. 6\n).

Pseudoviruses undergo the steps of infection that include attachment, fusion and expression of the reporter gene, but they cannot form infectious progeny due to the lack of viral structural genes needed for several steps of the viral life cycle. Thus, pseudoviruses do not propagate beyond a single cycle of infection. In this study, non-proliferating CV-A16 pseudoviruses were generated by encapsidating luciferase-encoding CV-A16 replicons in viral P1 capsid proteins via triple transfection of 293T cells, and an assay based on these pseudoviruses for measurement of CV-A16 neutralizing antibody titers in human serum was developed.",

The improved sensitivity is likely attributed to the inability of CV-A16 pseudoviruses to undergo multiple cycles of replication due to the lack of a P1 gene. Indeed, neutralization of the CV-A16 pseudoviruses can, therefore, be achieved with neutralizing antibodies which inhibit the initial binding of the viruses to the cells. When serum neutralization assays employ replication-competent viruses which can multiply after successfully entering the cell, typically greater levels of neutralizing antibodies are required to inhibit further viral spread, often resulting in an apparently lower neutralization titer. The cost of the cCNA is low, but requires at least 4 days to complete with manual microscopic examination and special expertise that may produce subjective variations among operators and laboratories. In this study, the processing time of the pCNA was shortened to 15 h (Fig. 3) by the use of CV-A16 pseudoviruses and detection of luciferase signals as the measure of infectivity. Therefore, the pseudovirus neutralization assay established in this study was demonstrated to be sensitive, safe, rapid, objective and therefore especially suited for rapid high-throughput screening of sera.",

Therefore, the pCNA may be conveniently and quickly adapted to test antibody neutralization of all genogroups of CV-A16 and EV71 viruses, providing a solid platform for the development of a high-throughput surveillance system for HFMD that can be used in rural clinics in Asia.
