Authors screened abstracts for the following inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed literature, written in English, and described AE HLCT of persons with an HHCD. Diseases considered highly hazardous were identified based on the following definition by the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases: \u201can infection that is easily transmissible from person to person; life-threatening; presents a serious hazard in the health-care setting and the community; and requires specific control measures (e.g., high-level isolation).\u201d14 This definition is understood to include various viral hemorrhagic fevers, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other easily transmissible emerging infectious diseases. Articles were reviewed if the abstract contained information related to the aim, with those focused exclusively on ground transport or AE of non-HHCD patients excluded.",

Lotz and Raffin20 indicated their transport met recommendations set by the World Health Organization for medical evacuation of patients with high infectious risk (36-48 hours). Thoms et al2 noted that \u201c. . . U.S. military policy is to treat highly infectious patients \u2018in place\u2019, and avoid unnecessary evacuation to the U.S.\u201d but acknowledged instances in which transport would occur, such as index cases or for political considerations. Given the current emphasis on military participation in nation-building efforts, it is unlikely that adequate resources for \u201ctreatment in place\u201d will be present during future outbreaks. As such, the military may become increasingly reliant on AE HLCTs.",

Biselli et al22 noted training includes personal protective equipment (PPE), patient management on ground and in-flight, and equipment decontamination, whereas Christopher and Eitzen,17 referring to training at United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), stated that \u201cteam members practice these skills on each other during\u2026\u2026training exercise.\u201d On-ground training at USAMRIID, when it had AE HLCT capability, occurred twice monthly, whereas flight training aboard a C-130 aircraft took place quarterly (L. Marklund, Written communication, December 2017). Clayton,23 using a Canadian system similar to USAMRIID's, further advocated medical crew knowledge on patient management and care techniques, hypobaric medicine, and equipment familiarization. Schilling et al21 discussed the importance of PPE training and detailed the timing of Italy's Aeromedical Isolation Team trainings, indicating military portions of their team are trained every 15 days. Likewise, Nicol et al19 noted that the UK's Royal Air Force Deployable Air Isolator Team convenes monthly for retraining on PPE and the patient isolator used for transports. A study by Lamb,24 which detailed a 2006 Royal Air Force mission, remarked on the benefit of in-flight, just-in-time training that occurred on the flight to the patient, while also stating that the mission resulted in routine air transport isolator exercises. As with many fields, it is difficult to determine applicable training and exercise needs for AE HLCT. Organizations work internally (considering equipment, mission, and personnel) to determine the appropriate training and delivery to maintain competency.",

Zone designation lends the ability to transport multiple patients at different stages of disease progression for the same disease or, more likely, to transport both suspected and confirmed patients. In the 1974 air medical transportation of a Lassa fever patient from Nigeria to Germany, the following zones were established: a containment zone where the patient was located, a crew zone where PPE was not worn, and a neutral zone between the 2 that was also available for plane-related emergency procedures.25\n",

Other articles lacked analysis and recommendations for HCW fatigue and shift rotation during longer transports. PPE can be cumbersome and trigger HCW physiological and psychological distress\u2014even in environmentally controlled biocontainment facilities26\u2014and may be exacerbated at altitude. Appropriate work-rest cycles; considerations to time in PPE; and fatigue, alertness, and clinical performance monitoring are important during AE HLCT. The objective analysis of these factors is necessary to maximize performance and safety.",
