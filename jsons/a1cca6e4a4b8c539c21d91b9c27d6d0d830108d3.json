We make some basic observations about some of the time series, including a comparison to numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly observe across all languages a peak for the language-specific word for 'virus' in January followed by a decline through February and a recent surge through March. The world's collective attention dropped away while the virus spread out from China. We host the time series on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis while relevant.

We exclude all tweets not assigned a language with sufficient confidence (an effective 4th ranked collection) and choose to include Ukranian (29th) over Cebuano (28th). We list the 24 languages by overall usage frequency in Tab. I. Second, we compare usage of 1-grams in March of 2020 with March 2019 to determine which 1-grams have become most elevated in relative usage.

For Indonesia, Our intent is to capture 1-grams that are topically and culturally important during the COVID-19 pandemic. While overall, we see pandemic-related words dominate the lists across languages, we also find considerable specific variation. Words for virus, quarantine, protective equipment, and testing show different orderings (note that we do not employ stemming). Unrelated 1-grams but important to the time of March 2020 are in evidence; the balance of these are important for our understanding of how much the pandemic is being talked about. Some 1-grams such as punctuation represent functional changes in the use of Twitter across languages; we include them nonetheless. To generate these lists we use the allotaxonometric method of rank-turbulence divergence to find the most distinguishing 1-grams (see Sec. II, Fig. 1 , and Ref. [9] ). We note that these tables are images and cannot be copied; see the Sec. IV for data download sites.

We sourced data for confirmed cases and fatalities from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering's COVID-19 project [3] . Starting on 2020/01/22, the project's data has been collected from national and regional health authorities across the world. The data is augmented by case reports from medical associations and social media posts-these later sources are validated against official records before publication.

The major observation is that the world's attention peaked early in late January around the news of an outbreak of a new infectious disease in Wuhan, declining through well into February before waking back up. The main plots in each panel show usage ranks at the day scale (GMT) (we use common sense ranking meaning the most frequently used 1-gram has rank r = 1). The solid lines indicating smoothing with a one week average (centered). The plots along the top of each panel show the relative fractions of each 1-gram's daily counts indicating as to whether they appear in retweets (RT, spreading) or organic tweets (OT, new material). The background shading shows when the balance favors spreading-story contagion. SeeFig. 3for the next 12 languages, as well as Sec. III for general discussion.
