Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) is generally self-limited and can be effectively controlled by macrolides3. However, severe MPP often happens and has complications such as pleural effusion, atelectasis and lung consolidation. According to literatures and our clinical experience, additional corticosteroids can effectively improve the clinical symptoms and chest radiographic manifestations of these severely affected children4\u20136. Although the severity of the disease appears to be related to the degree of the host immune response to the infection7, the pathogenesis of MPP is still not clear.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was derived from the lung tissue surface of the lesion, which directly reflects the inflammation and immunological responses of the infected local lung tissue. Linear discriminant analysis is used here to discriminate severe MPP from mild MPP and healthy control in children. It is a supervised method of high-dimensional data reduction on the levels of cytokines measured in BALF. These cytokines were selected by their biological relevance to MPP or immune cells involved in lung infection (see Supplementary Table S1). Eleven cytokines were found higher in MPP children compared with controls. Seven cytokines can be closely correlated with MPP severity and five of them are proinflammatory cytokines that may contribute to many of the symptoms these children experience. Further characterization of immune alterations in BALF of children MPP may provide additional clinical insight in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

To compare the expression patterns of these proteins, we analyzed the results using cluster analysis (Fig. 2a). The expression patterns confirmed higher expression levels in mild MPP, the highest expression levels in severe MPP group and the lowest expression levels in control group. MCP1 levels are the highest among all the cytokines. The expression pattern of TNF\u03b1 is close to IL6, while IL1\u03b2, MCP1 and IL4 have similar expression patterns as TNF and IL6.

Figure 3a shows how Th1 related factor IFN\u03b3 and Th2 related factor IL4 affect the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells, as well as the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells. IFN\u03b3 and Tbet promote the differentiation of Th0 to Th1 and IL4 and Gata3 promote the differentiation of Th0 to Th2. To explore the Th1/Th2 balance in BALF of MPP children, the ratios of IFN\u03b3/IL4 were calculated (Fig. 3b,c). Ratios of IFN\u03b3/IL4 in both mild MPP group and severe MPP group rose significantly compared to control group (Fig. 3b, padj < 0.05) while there was NO significant difference between mild MPP and severe MPP groups. We combined the results of mild MPP group and severe MPP group as the results of MPP group. The IFN\u03b3/IL4 ratios significantly increased in MPP group compared to control (Fig. 3c, padj < 0.01). As IL13 is a Th2 related cytokine expressed in lung, the ratios of IFN\u03b3/IL13 were also calculated. Similarly, the ratios of IFN\u03b3/IL13 in mild MPP group and in severe MPP group rose significantly compared with control group (Fig. 3d, padj < 0.01) while there was NO significant difference between mild MPP group and severe MPP group. IFN\u03b3/IL13 ratios significantly increased in MPP group compared to control (Fig. 3e, padj < 0.01).

To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study reporting multiplex results of the cytokines in BALF of children with MPP. The main finding of this study is that 13 cytokines helped to separate children with FB, mild MPP or severe MPP. Eleven cytokines increased greatly in both mild MPP children and severe MPP children. Significantly elevated trend of TNF\u03b1, IL6, IL1\u03b2, MCP1, IL4, IFN\u03b3 and IL10 was identified in mild MPP and severe MPP. Both Th1 related factor and Th2 related factors increased in the BALF of MPP children, while the ratios of IFN\u03b3/IL4 and IFN\u03b3/IL13 significantly rose in MPP children compared to control children. These results support a Th1-type dominant local response in the airway of acute children MPP.",

The linear combination of these cytokine-levels led to clear separations of severe MPP, mild MPP and control groups. Thus, we conclude that unique patterns of airway inflammations associate with mild MPP and severe MPP in children. The pathogenesis of severe MPP is complex and not completely understood. Linear discriminant analyses reveal relatively discrete groupings of control, mild MPP and severe MPP groups, which suggest that mild and severe MPP are truely phenotypically distinct.",

Even after corrections for multiple comparisons, linear relationships between these cytokine levels with disease severity are still statistically significant. No previous reports are found to apply the high-dimensional data reduction techniques on inflammatory cytokine study in BALF of children with MPP. However, ELISA is also a reliable method and has been used to study the cytokine levels in MPP children8\u201311. We compared published ELISA results with our Luminex assay results. Similar changes on some cytokine levels are reported in previous publications. For example, TNF\u03b1 levels increased in the peripheral blood of patients with MPP12 and severe MPP13 as well as those with refractory MPP14. Increased levels of TNF\u03b1 is related to acute MPP11, refractory MPP10 and wheezy in children with MPP15. TNF\u03b1 is also an optimal predictor for segmental MPP or lobar MPP with pleural effusion13. Another research team also reported significantly elevated levels of IL6 in the BALF of children with severe MPP compared to control16. IL6 levels in refractory MPP children are higher than those in general MPP children17. Xu\u2019s team reported that serum TNF\u03b1, IL6, IFN\u03b3 and IL10 levels of MPP group are significantly higher than control group18.",

In terms of pathogenesis, previous research focused on the roles of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3. Increased levels of TNF\u03b1 were related to many pulmonary inflammatory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury (ALI), sarcoidosis, asthma and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). People find TNF\u03b1 playing multiple roles in disease pathology, which include stimulating the generation of inflammatory mediators, inducing the accumulation of inflammatory cells and causing airway hyperresponsiveness22. The proinflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 is well known for its major roles in innate immunity and adaptive immunity against intracellular infections. IFN\u03b3 can coordinate a diverse array of cellular programs through its transcriptional regulation of the immunologically relevant genes. The cellular effects of IFN\u03b3 include up-regulating the antigen presentation, pathogen recognition, leukocyte trafficking and immunomodulation23. IL10 has broad anti-inflammatory properties, which include counteracting the function of Th1 cells. During Toxoplasma gondii infection, people discovered that IFN\u03b3-producing Tbet (+) Foxp3 (\u2212) Th1 cells produced host-protective IL10 in an autocrine manner, which played important roles of regulating immunopathology24.",

As a classic feature of asthma, IL5 activates eosinophils and cause airway inflammation26. Increased levels of IL5 and IL13 found in MPP children may be connected to the concurrence of MPP and asthma in children. Some results show that MPP children with wheeze have significantly higher levels of IL5 and VEGF in the serum compared to MPP children without wheeze27. Flt3L is critical for instructing the generation of DC from Flt3+ lymphoid and myeloid-committed progenitors throughout different organs in vivo28. One team reported significantly increased IL2 levels in BALF of MPP children comparing to control19, which is consistent with our findings. We also found that the levels of IL1\u03b2, MCP1, sCD40L and IFN\u03b1 increased significantly in MPP children, which has not been reported so far by other teams.",

First, because the children in FB control group are significantly younger than that of the MPP groups, they are not perfect controls. Although we didn\u2019t see difference in cell composition between the groups29, immune response types may change as the children grow. The lack of a healthy pediatric control group because of ethical reasons does raise the question whether age affects the experimental results. Second, although the ratios of IFN\u03b3/IL4, IFN\u03b3/IL13 and T-bet/Gata3 may reflect the activation ratios of Th1/Th2 cells, the increased levels of IFN\u03b3 may also reflect the activation of other cells including ILCs, NKT cells and NK cells. Further studies will be needed to explore the existence and function of these cells in BALF of MPP children. The last is the cross-sectional design. Future longitudinal studies are necessary to address whether MPP children remain within their cytokine signature over time.",

The diagnosis of MP infection is based on serologic test and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mild community-acquired pneumonia and severe community-acquired pneumonia are defined based on the criteria described30\u201332. Mild is defined as respiratory rate <70 breaths/min at age <3 years old or respiratory rate <50 breaths/min at age \u22653 years old, normal food-intake, no dehydration33. Severe is defined as respiratory rate \u226570 breaths/min at age <3 years old or respiratory rate >50 breaths/min at age \u22653 years old, cyanosis, flaring of the nares, marked retractions, anorexia and dehydration; or MPP combined with pleural effusion, lung necrosis/lung abscess and other complications in lung; or MPP combined with dysfunction of other systems34. By measuring the maximum thickness of fluid between the visceral and parietal pleurae on a CT scan, pleural effusion was defined as fluid thickness >5 mm35. Children with other respiratory infections and tuberculosis are excluded in terms of the following tests: purified-protein derivative (PPD), blood culture, pleural effusion culture, nasopharyngeal suction/swab culture, nasopharyngeal suction/swab virus antigen detection and serology for Chlamydia pneumonia and Legionella pneumonia. Children, who had asthma, repeated respiratory infections, chronic heart disease, rheumatic diseases or immune deficiencies are also excluded. BALF samples are collected only from children with acute MPP before treatment. Children with mild MPP are only chosen when they hav segmental or lobular pneumonia. Children with FB are included as control, which had no respiratory tract illness in the previous 6 weeks. At the moment of sample collecting, the FB children had no clinical symptom, no sign of lung inflammation or infection observed under brochoscopy.",
