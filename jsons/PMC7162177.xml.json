This cellular response provides two advantages for viral replication; it facilitates rapid viral protein synthesis and inhibits the production of antiviral proteins (Lyles, 2000). On the other hand, viruses and their hosts share the same translational machinery. Therefore, global inhibition of protein synthesis can also be regarded as part of an antiviral response of the host aimed to minimize viral replication.",

CoVs replicate entirely within the cytoplasm of their host cells, where they produce a nested set of (sub)genomic mRNAs, containing identical 5\u2032\u2010leader sequences and coterminal 3\u2032\u2010ends (Pasternak et al., 2006). These mRNAs, which are transcribed via a discontinuous transcription mechanism, are 5\u2032\u2010capped and 3\u2032\u2010polyadenylated, making them structurally equivalent to host cellular mRNAs (Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005). Therefore, CoVs must hijack the host translational machinery to produce their own proteins.",

Raaben and C. A. M. de Haan, unpubl. results). The mechanism by which this occurs and how CoVs themselves escape from it is not known. As the leader sequence, present on all viral mRNAs, enhances translation in MHV\u2010infected cells, it has been suggested that the apparent downregulation of host protein synthesis is not primarily due to inhibition of translation (Tahara et al., 1994). On the other hand, the reduced host mRNA translation in MHV\u2010infected cells has also been associated with a decrease in the number and size of polysomes and an increase of inactive single 80S ribosomes (Hilton et al., 1986), and with cleavage of 28S ribosomal RNA (Banerjee et al., 2000). Furthermore, it has been suggested that a decline in steady\u2010state levels, found for some host cell mRNAs, contributes to the downregulation of host protein translation (Hilton et al., 1986; Kyuwa et al., 1994; Tahara et al., 1994). More recently, the expression of the SARS\u2010CoV non\u2010structural protein 1 (nsp1) was reported to induce mRNA degradation and inhibition of host protein synthesis (Kamitani et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Host shutoff is not restricted to virus infected cells, but is induced by various stress stimuli (Brostrom and Brostrom, 1998). For example, cells deprived of nutrients inhibit protein synthesis to conserve amino acids for essential metabolic processes. In addition, cells also shut down protein synthesis in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, heat and oxidative stress. These different stress stimuli induce translational shutoff via the increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2\u03b1 (de Haro et al., 1996). In mammalian cells there are at least four eIF2\u03b1 kinases, including GCN2, PKR, PERK and HRI, which are activated by amino acid starvation, double stranded RNA, ER stress and haem depletion, respectively (Berlanga et al., 1999; Harding et al., 1999; Kaufman, 2000; Lu et al., 2001). Upon phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, cytoplasmic structures containing stalled translational preinitiation complexes, frequently referred to as stress granules (SGs), are formed. The actual formation of SGs occurs upon aggregation of the RNA binding proteins TIA\u20101 (T\u2010cell internal antigen\u20101) and TIAR (TIA\u20101\u2010related protein) (Kedersha et al., 1999). SGs are thought to recruit specific mRNA transcripts, such as \u2018housekeeping\u2019 protein encoding mRNAs, to regulate their translation in adaptation to altered conditions (Anderson and Kedersha, 2002). SGs are also referred to as triage centres because they sort mRNAs for either storage, reinitiation of translation, or degradation (Anderson and Kedersha, 2006).",

While 3\u2032\u22125\u2032 mRNA decay occurs by a complex of exonucleases termed the exosome, 5\u2032\u22123\u2032 mRNA decay takes place in cytoplasmic foci related to SGs, called processing bodies (P bodies) (Anderson and Kedersha, 2006). P bodies contain decapping enzymes, the exonuclease Xrn1 and components of the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex, including GW182, which is an RNA binding protein required for microRNA\u2010dependent silencing (Ingelfinger et al., 2002; Eystathioy et al., 2003; Cougot et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2005). The formation of P bodies is also induced in response to different stress stimuli including glucose deprivation and osmotic stress. However, unlike SGs their assembly does not require phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Kedersha et al., 2005; Teixeira et al., 2005).",

This downregulation, which is reminiscent of a cellular stress response, was shown to be dependent on viral replication and to result from mRNA decay. At the same time, increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and the assembly of SGs and P bodies were observed, suggesting that these cellular structures play an important role in the host translational shutoff and mRNA decay respectively. MHV replication was not negatively affected, but rather enhanced in mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells, in which host translational shutoff and SG formation were impaired by mutation. Apparently, virus replication does not benefit, at least in vitro, from the induced translational shutoff.",

The results, shown in Fig. 1A, clearly demonstrated that host translation was shut down at 6, but not at 4 h post infection, while the viral spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins were clearly visible at 6 h and at later time points post infection. Thus, between 4 and 6 h post infection, a shift occurred from host to viral protein synthesis. This conclusion was corroborated by quantification of the radioactivity in the gel (Fig. 1B). The data show that there is a continuous rise in expression of the viral protein S, N and M, with the largest increase appearing between 4 and 6 h post infection. The amount of radioactivity in the regions between the viral proteins, representative of host protein synthesis, were also quantified, and confirmed the induction of host shutoff between 4 and 6 h post infection.",

Consistent with the results of the metabolic labelling experiment, the largest relative increase in viral RNA levels was observed between 4 and 6 h post infection. (Fig. 1D).

At 4 h post infection, relatively few changes in the expression profile were observed (Fig. 2A). However, at 6 h post infection, a significant number of genes appeared to be altered in their expression (Fig. 2B). Besides the apparent upregulation of several mRNAs, a large number of mRNAs (678) was significantly downregulated upon infection. This set of mRNAs is represented by the yellow dots in the different panels of Fig. 2. Actinomycin D (ActD), an inhibitor of cellular transcription but not of CoV replication (Robb and Bond, 1979; Lai et al., 1981), was used to establish whether the observed mRNA downregulation was the result of a transcriptional or a post\u2010transcriptional mechanism. Treatment of both infected and uninfected cells with ActD, did not affect the downregulation of mRNAs, indicating that the observed decrease is the result of post\u2010transcriptional mRNA degradation (Fig. 2C). To study the specificity of this virus\u2010induced mRNA degradation, the effect of ActD treatment was analysed in the absence of a viral infection. Treatment of cells with ActD, or with other transcriptional inhibitors, induces the downregulation of short\u2010lived mRNAs (Cheadle et al., 2005). Indeed, downregulation of many mRNAs was observed in ActD\u2010treated cells when compared with mock\u2010treated cells (Fig. 2D). However, the mRNA population downregulated by ActD treatment clearly differed from the mRNAs downregulated in response to MHV infection at 6 h post infection (the latter ones are represented by the yellow dots). In order to determine the role of virus replication in the mRNA decay, cells were inoculated with fusion\u2010competent, replication incompetent, UV\u2010inactivated virus. The results show, that the MHV\u2010induced downregulation of mRNA (shown again as yellow dots) is replication\u2010dependent, as it was not observed after inoculation with the UV\u2010inactivated virus (Fig. 2E).",

As approximately 20% of the viral RNA present in the LR7 cells at 6 h post infection was not removed by the oligo capture technique (M. Raaben and C. A. M. de Haan, unpubl. results), a large number of the mRNAs upregulated in the presence of ActD are likely to result from cross hybridization of the remaining viral RNA. Indeed, this was confirmed for some hits using quantitative RT\u2010PCR analysis (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude that some of these hits might also result from increased mRNA stability upon virus infection, a subject of further research. In order to exclude (potential) false\u2010positive hits, the genelists of the experiments performed in the absence or presence of ActD were compared. As a result, 243 genes were excluded from the analysis since they were upregulated under both experimental conditions, leaving 40 genes that were specifically upregulated at the transcriptional level in MHV\u2010infected LR7 cells at 6 h post infection. The genes identified were clustered according to their GO terms for biological processes (see Supplementary Table S2). Out of the 40 genes, we could annotate 29 genes. Examples of genes of which the expression was induced were those encoding inflammatory cytokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2), a marker of the unfolded protein response (Herpud1), and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1).

Host translational shutoff is not observed in these cells during stress or alphavirus infection (Scheuner et al., 2001; McInerney et al., 2005). In addition, replication was monitored in TIA\u20101\u2013/\u2013 and TIAR\u2013/\u2013 MEFs. These MEFs have been demonstrated to exhibit impaired SG assembly, as well as delayed host translational shutoff after virus infections (Gilks et al., 2004; McInerney et al., 2005). Unfortunately, host translational shutoff could not be studied by metabolic labelling of the cells upon infection with MHV, as only 10\u201320% of the MEF cells in a dish could be infected after a high multiplicity infection with MHV (data not shown). Nevertheless, viral replication in the MEF cells was monitored, not by determining the production of infectious virions, but by following the expression of a reporter gene after infection with MHV\u2010EFLM, which carries the firefly luciferase (FL) in an MHV\u2010A59 background. FL expressed by MHV has been shown to be a reliable measure for virus replication (de Haan et al., 2005). The intracellular FL levels were determined at different time points post infection and normalized for the number of infected cells, which differed slightly between the MEF cell lines. Clearly, MHV replication was enhanced in the eIF2\u03b1S51A\u2010expressing cells as compared with the wild\u2010type eIF2\u03b1\u2010expressing cells (Fig. 4A). Similarly, replication was also enhanced in the TIAR\u2013/\u2013 cells, while MHV replicated to approximately the same extent in the TIA\u20101\u2013/\u2013 and wild\u2010type MEF cells (Fig. 4B). Overall, the results show that replication of MHV is not negatively affected but rather enhanced in cells with impaired host translational shutoff.",

For MHV it was shown already in the eighties that infection induces host translational shutoff, while maintaining its own protein synthesis (Rottier et al., 1981; Siddell et al., 1981; Hilton et al., 1986). However, the cellular processes underlying MHV\u2010induced inhibition of host protein synthesis remained largely unknown. We now show that this inhibition coincides with degradation of numerous mRNAs, many of which encode protein translation\u2010related factors. In addition, infection with MHV results in increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and in the formation of SGs and P bodies, which are sites of mRNA stalling and degradation respectively. Altogether these results indicate that MHV infection induces an integrated stress response, which results in increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and in the formation of SGs and P bodies, leading to shutdown of host mRNA translation and to mRNA decay (Fig. 5).",

Interestingly, MHV infection induced the degradation of transcripts encoding the chemokines Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 in the presence of ActD (data not shown), whereas higher levels of these transcripts were observed during infection in the absence of ActD, indicating that the expression of individual genes can be regulated both at the transcriptional and post\u2010transcriptional level.",

In agreement with our results, mRNA decay was demonstrated to be the main cause of the observed downregulation of these mRNA levels (Grigull et al., 2004). These results indicate that CoV infection elicits a cellular response, which resembles the reaction of yeast cells upon environmental stress. Recently, expression of the SARS\u2010CoV nsp1 has been shown to result in degradation of several host mRNAs and in translational shutoff (Kamitani et al., 2006). A direct role for nsp1 in mRNA degradation might explain the observed effects, even though nsp1 has no sequence similarities with any known RNases, and is only poorly conserved among CoVs. Alternatively, expression of the SARS\u2010CoV nsp1 might induce a cellular stress response resulting in mRNA decay and in inhibition of protein synthesis. In agreement herewith, others showed that expression of SARS\u2010CoV nsp1 induced activation of the stress\u2010related transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB and chemokine upregulation (Law et al., 2007).",

On the other hand, as the coronaviral mRNAs are structurally equivalent to the host mRNAs, viral protein synthesis might also be impaired, even though viral protein synthesis is still robust after host translational shutoff. The results obtained with the host translational shutoff\u2010deficient (eIF2\u03b1S51A) MEF cells show that in the absence of phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1 MHV replication is not negatively affected. Thus, the stress response induced upon infection with MHV, which results in the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and the subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis, does not appear to be beneficial for MHV replication in vitro. This is in contrast to reoviruses, replication of which has been demonstrated to be facilitated by the induced cellular stress response and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Smith et al., 2006). Our conclusions are corroborated by the results obtained with the TIA\u20101\u2013/\u2013 and TIAR\u2013/\u2013 MEFs, which exhibit impaired SG assembly and host translational shutoff, and in which MHV replication was also not negatively affected but, rather, enhanced.

Previously it has been reported that the leader sequence present at the 5\u2032\u2010end of all MHV encoded mRNAs mediates their preferential translation (Tahara et al., 1993; 1994). However, the precise mechanism by which this is established is still unknown. The exponential increase in the abundance of viral mRNAs during infection is also likely to contribute to a preferential translation of these mRNAs, simply as a result of increasing abundance in the competition for the limited translational machinery. We have calculated that at 6 h post infection up to 40% of all mRNAs in the cell is virus\u2010encoded. Furthermore, the downregulation of many mRNAs encoding protein translation\u2010related factors, probably via the induction of P bodies, is also likely to increase the success of the viral mRNAs in their competition with the host\u2010encoded mRNAs.",
