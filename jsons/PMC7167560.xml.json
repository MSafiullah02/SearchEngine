The imminent challenges faced by research participants in intervention clinical studies beyond the fear of unknown include concerns for adequate access to and availability of experimental therapeutic agents that are not available outside regulated clinical trials, travel arrangements to be made if the clinical trial site is distant, existence of adequate expertise closer to patients to deal with adverse effects, or challenges that may arise in the context of clinical trials and effect this may have on caregivers. These and other challenges are expected to cause significant anxiety and distress in clinical trial participants and their loved ones, especially those with life-threatening illnesses such as cancer.",

Their most active challenge is the commitment to the patients and participants of ongoing clinical trials to ensure that adequate medication supply is available, to ensure that the most up-to-date information about the experimental agent is readily available to the study sites, to meet the regulatory requirements and maintain the highest standards of manufacturing and quality control, and to maintain records. A unique challenge faced by the industry is the effect on a pipeline of compounds and clinical studies that have not started yet but are in advanced stages of development.",

            "text": "Although no precedence exists in the recent past of the scale of disruption seen in the past few weeks, the uncertainties and distress are natural and anticipated. We believe that the most important principles of biomedical research remain beneficence, justice, and respect of persons. Good faith actions that enhance the safety and well-being of study participants honor these principles and are outlined in FDA regulations (21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)3 as \u201cexceptions where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the human subjects.\u201d The most important and critical step in preparing for any eventuality is for the study teams to work closely with their study sponsors to determine a course of action that supports the rights, safety, and welfare of participants without compromising the integrity of research. Some of the options available for investigators and study teams are to consider minimizing face-to-face visits, when possible, and develop plans with the sponsors for alternatives such as telephone visit and telemedicine visit using the technological expertise available at various sites. The teams should proactively contact research patients and discuss their concerns and contingency plans. The sponsors should consider conducting presite visits, site initiation visits, and routine monitoring visits remotely by using current advancements in remote video- and telecommunications as several HIPAA-compliant options are in existence. Documentation of these communications and plans of actions should be robustly maintained. Given these extraneous circumstances, the institutional review boards and/or independent ethics committees should not make determination of serious nonadherence for actions that are done in good faith to protect and promote the safety and welfare of the human subjects of research as long as such actions are supported by proper documentation. Finally, we believe that this national emergency identifies a unique opportunity for regulatory bodies such as the FDA to develop a formal plan of preparedness. Incorporating emergency and disaster preparedness into the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative course and into Good Clinical Practice training courses will go a long way to ensure future preparedness. In summary, as various stakeholders involved in biomedical research gear up the plans to deal with any eventuality, it is imperative to remember the core principles that underlie the trust of society in biomedical research enterprise: beneficence, justice, and respect of persons.4\n",
