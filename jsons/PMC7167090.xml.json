Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV\u20102) emerged as a new virus in dogs in 1978 and was soon replaced by variant viruses (CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b), which continue to coexist in the dog population (Truyen 1999). Recently, a CPV\u20102 mutant was detected in Italy (Buonavoglia and others 2001). The mutation occurred in residue 426 (Asp was replaced by Glu), so it was called mutant Glu\u2010426 or CPV\u20102c. This mutation has also been detected in other countries such as Spain, Great Britain, Germany and Portugal (Decaro and others 2007a).",

In some cases, enteritis can be more severe and associated with mortality (Evermann and others 2005). There are two genotypes of CCoV, namely, CCoV type I (CCoV\u2010I) and type II (CCoV\u2010II). These two genotypes are now regarded as members of the species Geselavirus within the genus Alphacoronavirus, together with swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline coronavirus type I (FCoV\u2010I) and type II (FCoV\u2010II) (de Groot and others 2008). CCoV infection is usually restricted to the enteric tract, although, in Italy, CCoV was recently associated with a systemic fatal disease in pups (Buonavoglia and others 2006). Severe clinical signs were observed in the affected pups, and necropsy examination revealed remarkable gross lesions in lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys. CCoV type II RNA was detected at very high titres in the internal organs of these dead pups. The association of CCoV with a severe, sometimes fatal disease in dogs, together with the isolation of the virus from internal organs with severe lesions, strongly suggests that CCoV tropism has evolved to acquire the ability to spread from the intestinal tract to other organs (Decaro and others 2007b).",

Fatal cases of pantropic CCoV infection alone have only ever been observed in Italy (Buonavoglia and others 2006). We report on outbreaks of pantropic CCoV in France and Belgium, including the first case of a lethal infection with pantropic CCoV in a European country other than Italy, thus extending the area of distribution of this lethal viral infection.",

In March and June 2008, the first and the second outbreaks occurred in dogs belonging to a breeder of miniature pinchers in Bourg Fid\u00e8le, France (three pups affected and died and nine pups affected of which eight died, respectively). These were the first French cases. Clinical signs were observed at two months of age and consisted of lethargy, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea and convulsions. The attending veterinarian of the cases suspected parvovirus infection. Despite supportive treatment (fluid therapy and \u03c9 interferon 2 million IU/kg), the puppies died within 3 days. Eight (three from the first outbreak and five from the second one) of the dead puppies were frozen and submitted to the authors institution for further investigation. In addition, faecal samples were taken for analysis from two diarrhoeic animals (dogs ULg 100 and ULg 103) from another litter at the breeder after the second outbreak. Outbreaks 3 and 4 occurred in a pet shop in P\u00e9ruwelz, Belgium, in September and November 2008 (in total seven puppies died); these were the first cases in Belgium. Outbreak 5 occurred in Oudenburg, Belgium, in August 2009 (two puppies died). In each of these last three outbreaks, one puppy was submitted for necropsy and virological investigation. Clinical signs were the same in all animals but one showed non\u2010haemorrhagic enteritis and survived. Necropsies were performed and organs (intestine, spleen, liver, lung and brain) were removed separately, crushed and analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, histopathologic evaluation was performed.",

In most of the reported cases, the veterinarian suspected a CPV\u20102 infection.
