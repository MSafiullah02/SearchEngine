Based on the genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis of the G gene and the F gene, hMPV is classified as one of two major genotypes, hMPV-A and hMPV-B, which are subdivided into four subgroups (A1, A2, B1 and B2)12,13.",

The above reasons are \u201cexternal factors\u201d of this alternating epidemic, \u201cinternal factors\u201d include virus escape, virus evolution, and interactions between virus subtypes. Co-circulation of the two genotypes of hMPV was usually observed and the interactions between them such as competitive growth might play a role in the formation of alternation22,27,28. However, there is no study about it. Most studies of the alternation of the A/B strains during epidemics have been focused on clinical investigations of hMPV strains isolated from symptomatic patients that involved genotyping and statistical analysis, and there was no basic experimental evidence29\u201331; We set our study in animal model (BALB/c mice) and cell model (Vero-E6) separately with two different genotypes of hMPV (genotype A: NL/1/00; B: NL/1/99) in different proportions.",

The statistical results for the two subtypes indicated that subtypes A and B of hMPV alternate in terms of prevalence, and each epidemic can last for 1\u20133 years. This result was also compared with those of previous studies2,14\u201320,29,39,40. Many researchers have studied the alternation of genotype prevalence of hMPV and the most discussed reason for this phenomenon is environmental changes and human immunity24,41. Viral evolution and escape are also thought to play a role in this phenomenon42,43. In summary, studies of the epidemiological distribution, alternation of the genotype predominance and genetic diversity of hMPV have been conducted all over the world, but these studies have mainly involved patients with clinical manifestations of respiratory infection, and no basic research has been conducted to explain the occurrence of this phenomenon32,44. Studies have shown that such alternation may be related to virus-to-host immune escape, and persistent infection or a high viral load is easily detected, which leads to the neglect of low-load subtypes. The differences in the genetic structure of hMPV and immunization against viruses caused a seasonal shift in the predominant genotype and led to the maintenance of infection rates2,19,21,35,45,46. If we can determine how hMPV genotypes interact, this may be helpful for epidemic detection, treatment and prevention. We try to focus on the virus itself firstly and explore whether the interaction mechanism between A and B subtypes will affect this alternation.",

First, in the mouse model (Fig. 1), the trend of type A was down-up-down, and genotype B was predominant in the end. Except for when A:B = 80:20 during which the starting amount of genotype B was too small, the proportion of B increased slowly in the first 13d and decreased at 17d, and then increased at 20d. There may seem to have a phenomenon that no matter how virus input ratio was used, competition existed between the two subtypes and genotype B predominated in the animal models eventually. We speculated that the competitive advantage of subtype B may be related to its strong virulence47,48, so we designed experiments to infect mice with A and B subtype or mixed subtypes to detect the severity of disease. However, based on our in vivo animal experiment results, the severity of illness was not related to infection with genotypes A and B in terms of weight changes (Fig. 2), viral load (Fig. 3) airway hyperresponsiveness (Fig. 4) or histopathological changes in the lungs (Fig. 5). This was shown not only for genotype A and B infection alone but also for 50:50, 20:80 and 80:20 mixed genotype infections. Although the results surprised us, previous clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in clinical manifestations between the two subtypes. From 2002 to 2004 in the USA, Apapov E et al.2 first found that hMPV caused a viral genotype shift, but did not observe a difference in the severity of illness caused by various hMPV isolates. In Italy, from 2003 to 2004, Bosis S et al.49 found that a high hMPV viral load was correlated with disease presentation, whereas the overall clinical and socioeconomic burden caused by infection with the two hMPV genotypes was similar. From 2006 to 2008 in southern Brazil, Debur MC et al. found no correlation between genotype and disease severity in inpatients and outpatients50. In the same period (2006\u20132008) in China, no association was found between hMPV genotypes and disease severity51. In summary, we found that hMPV subtypes compete in vivo, but virulence is not the reason for its competitive advantages. The specific reasons need to be further explored, but we verified there is a competition between type A and B in animal at the first time, and this competition may play an alternating role in nature.",

In the cell model (Fig. 6), different input ratios were used to infect Vero-E6 cells, and the viral titer of the two genotypes were detected. Genotype shifts were observed at input ratios of 50:50, 20:80 80:20, 10:100 and 100:10. The proportion of genotype A rose, fell and finally rose again until genotype B could not be detected. Even when A:B = 10:100 and the initial proportion of A was only 1/10 of that of B, it was also possible to gradually obtain a growth advantage and finally for A to become the predominant genotype. In the A:B = 100:10 group, due to the absolute initial proportion of genotype A being very large, the proportion of genotype A did not increase and decline but first decreased and then increased. Based on the above, in spite of the A and B genotypes having different initial proportions, the genotype ratio trends were the same; that is, the proportion of A first increased and then decreased and finally predominated. At the same time, the proportion of genotype B decreased, which was followed by an increase, until finally B disappeared at the detection end point. In summary, we observed the competition of the two hMPV genotypes, type A and B were alternately predominant in cell in the first four generations, and subtype A became predominant strain in the end.",

In animal experiments, even if we control the external environment and diet of each group to be the same, the final result is related to the virus subtype addition ratio and the host immunity. Obviously, in animal experiments, subtype B shows a stronger adaptability. This is inconsistent with the conclusion that subtype A is the dominant strain in human52,53. It may be that the hMPV dominant strain is different in different populations, or that our experiment time is too short54,55. In a word, our experiments showed that the competition exist between the two subtypes and this competition could affect the alternation of genotype prevalence.",

We used only the Vero-E6 in vitro system and BALB/c mice for the in vivo experiments, and additional cell lines and animal models needed to be studied. Second, we monitored the animal model for only 20 days, because in previous studies, we found that the hMPV can only survive in mice for 2\u20133 weeks. If we find a way to extend the survival time of the hMPV in mice, the results may be more consistent with the in vitro results. Third, in animal experiments, host immunity can interfere with the impact of hMPV subtype competition on hMPV alternating epidemics. We tried to use the immunosuppressant cyclophosphamide to suppress the immunity of mice, but the use of the inhibitor caused a large number of deaths in mice. We are still looking for suitable inhibitors to suppress the immunity of mice to verify the effect of hMPV subtype competition on alternating epidemics simply. Fourth, the statistical analysis of hMPV global epidemiology may be incomplete, and some reports did not subdivide the subtypes, which may have led to insufficient data for the statistical analysis. Therefore, the actual relationships between hMPV epidemiology, disease severity and genotype alternation need to be further explored.",

Subtype A predominant in vitro and subtype B in vivo experiment, and the genotype alternation observed in vitro. There were no statistically significant differences in the severity of disease caused by the two hMPV genotypes, and the severity of disease caused by mixed infection was not worse than that caused by single genotype infection. Our results may improve the understanding of the alternation of the prevalence of hMPV genotypes; perhaps this is a strategy involving genetic structure changes that is used by the virus to seasonally maintain infection rates. This study of hMPV affords us the possibility of another explanation of the hMPV alternation epidemic besides the cause of immunity, environment and climate, and it also provides experimental evidence useful for disease control and vaccine development.",

The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. When the cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was 70%, all supernatants and plates were harvested and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. One millilitre of viral media was harvested at each passage, and the supernatant was passaged into fresh Vero-E6 cells. Then, 200 \u03bcl of RNA extract was added, and the remaining volume was maintained at \u221280 \u00b0C. This method was used for each passage and was continued for 12 passages. After each passage, we changed the medium and harvested the supernatant for testing. All tests were performed in triplicate, and six-well plates were used.",
