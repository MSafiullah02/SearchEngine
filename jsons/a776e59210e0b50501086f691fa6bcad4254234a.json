As of February 25, 2020, 81,109 cases were reported, including 2918 cases in 37 countries other than China [1] . Early and correct diagnosis is crucial to prevent spread of the infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to confirm the microbiological diagnosis. However, sensitivity in different types of specimens remains unclear. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that sputum be collected if possible in addition to upper respiratory specimens, but does not regard sputum collection as mandatory [2] . We report a case of a 35-year-old febrile woman without any respiratory symptoms who travelled from Wuhan, China, and were later diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on a lower respiratory specimen but was negative on throat swabs.",

She was healthy until January 30 when she developed fever with mild diarrhoea. On January 31, at the primary care clinic, the rapid influenza antigen test was negative. Chest X-ray revealed signs of pneumonia in the left lower lung and she was transferred to the Japanese Red Cross Narita Hospital. She denied having sore throat, rhinorrhea, chills and cough. She had not visited Huanan market and was not exposed to any wild or dead animals. On admission, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 106/66 mmHg, heart rate 93 beats/min, body temperature 37.9 C, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min and oxygen saturation on room air 97%. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results did not reveal leukocytosis, leukocytopenia or elevated liver function enzymes. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed slight ground-glass opacity in the left lower lung lobe ( Figure 1 ). She was admitted to an isolation room with negative pressure. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were administered after obtaining a throat swab. The PCR test on the throat swab for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. Her fever persisted but she had no respiratory symptoms such as cough. On hospital day 5, induced sputum and a second throat swab were obtained. The PCR test on induced sputum was positive but the throat swab was still negative. Her condition was stable and fever and diarrhoea improved on hospital day 6. She recovered fully and was discharged on hospital day 12 after sputum and throat swab samples tested negative by PCR. During her clinical course, she never had a PCR-positive throat swab ( Figure 2 ). All PCR tests were performed at the reference laboratory by real-time RT-PCR assays following a previously described method [3] .",

The CDC guideline suggests that lower respiratory specimens are the preferred clinical specimens for diagnosis of MERS [6] . Another study also suggested that upper respiratory specimens are not suitable for diagnosing MERS in the early stages [7] . In our case, the first PCR test was performed on a throat swab because she had no respiratory symptoms and could not produce sputum. However, PCR on sputum obtained on day 5 was positive but a second throat swab obtained on the same day was still negative, suggesting that lower respiratory specimens have higher sensitivity.",
