The COVID-19 outbroke from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, has spread to other provinces of China and even other countries.3 Strong human-to-human transmission is established.4 Until Feb. 11, 2020, there have been 44653 cases of COVID-19 infections confirmed in mainland China, including 1113 deaths. To prevent and control the spread of the epidemic, many strategies are needed.5 Predicting the trend of the epidemic are quite important to the allocation of medical resources, the arrangement of production activities, and even the domestic economic development all over China. Therefore, it is very urgent to use the latest data to establish an efficient and highly suitable epidemic analysis and prediction model according to the actual situation, and then to give reliable predictions, which could provide an important reference for the government to formulate emergency macroeconomic decisions and medical resources allocation.",
