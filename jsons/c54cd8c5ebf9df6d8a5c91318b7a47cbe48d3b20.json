However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected from a simple finger prick and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS).",

Testing for infection is key to identifying cases and for tracing community spread of the virus, which is critical for informing efforts aimed at mitigation. Provider-collected nucleic acid-based tests of naso-pharyngeal (NP) swabs are being used worldwide to detect virus during the acute stage of infection, but shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), NP swabs, transport media, and testing reagents in the US have limited application to the most serious cases, inhibiting efforts to identify and trace the actual prevalence and spread of the virus in the community.

Much of our knowledge of COVID-19 has derived from the most severe hospitalized and even lethal cases, with far less information coming from milder cases in the community. Additional research is needed before serological testing can be used to answer critical questions such as who is safe from reacquisition of COVID-19 or how to roll out vaccine access to those still susceptible. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies can be quantified with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and protocols for serum or plasma samples are now established 6 . However, the use of serum/plasma limits wider application in non-clinical settings due to the costs and logistical constraints associated with collecting, processing, and transporting venous blood. Deploying phlebotomists for large scale testing would also consume scarce PPE. Furthermore, when sheltering-in-place is required or encouraged, people may be less able or willing to leave home and samples drawn for serology studies that rely on clinic-based blood collection are likely to be biased.",

With DBS, a lancet is used to prick the finger, and up to five drops of blood are placed on filter paper, where it dries. DBS sampling has served as the foundation for nation-wide newborn screening programs since the 1960s, and it is increasingly applied as a minimally-invasive alternative to venipuncture in community-and population-based health research, including several applications in infectious disease epidemiology [8] [9] [10] . Advantages of DBS sampling include low cost, potential for selfsampling, ease of shipment (samples can be returned in the mail with no cold chain or special handling required), and reduced biohazard risk in transit and in the lab (the CDC and US Postal Service consider DBS specimens nonregulated, exempt materials) 11 . It is important to emphasize that DBS sampling is distinct from point-of-care lateral flow (LF) testing, which also uses finger stick blood.

Both protocols focus on IgG because it remains detectable long after infection, although the protocols can be easily adapted to measure IgM. The assays target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, a large glycoprotein on the viral surface that mediates attachment to host cells and facilitates viral entry. The RBD is very immunogenic: It is the target of neutralizing antibodies, and prior work has demonstrated that it is an effective capture antigen in ELISA 6, 14, 15 . We describe our protocols as well as results from the analysis of confirmed positive and negative samples to demonstrate the validity of the DBS assays.",

The construct was made by fusing the N-terminal S protein signal sequence to the spike RBD (amino acids 419 to 541) with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. The sequence was codon optimized for mammalian expression and subcloned into the pCAGGS mammalian expression vector. Recombinant RBD protein was generated by Evotec using standard methods (Princeton, New Jersey). Briefly, EXPI293 cells were transfected with purified, endotoxin free plasmid DNA. Four L of media was purified using IMAC chromatography 72 hours post transfection. The final recovery of purified recombinant RBD protein was ~195mg in PBS with an endotoxin level at ~ 1EU/mg, with a purity >95%.",

Mean number of days between PCR test and DBS collection was 26.7 (range: 25-35). DBS samples from five individuals presumed to be negative based on the pre-pandemic date of sample collection (2018) were analyzed on the same plate. All samples were analyzed in duplicate, with the average result reported.

OD responses for DBS samples from confirmed PCR positive cases in comparison with presumptive negatives. Differences between positives and negatives are statistically significant for Protocol 1 (top; one-way t = 1.99, p=0.04) and Protocol 2 (below; one-way t = 2.05, p=0.03). One positive case did not have sufficient DBS material for analysis with Protocol 1.",
