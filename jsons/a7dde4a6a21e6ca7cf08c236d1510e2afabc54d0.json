These large, industrial swine farms, commonly known as confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), are thought to be sites for novel pathogen emergence and transmission. In recent years, swine pathogen epizootics in China have included porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [4] , porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [5] , swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus [6] , and, most recently, a 2018-19 massive outbreak of African Swine Fever [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 168, "end": 170, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 288, "end": 291, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 582, "end": 585, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 620, "end": 623, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 668, "end": 671, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 744, "end": 747, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Beyond these swine-only pathogens, swine zoonotic pathogens threaten to harm not only the animals, but also the people exposed to them.

In particular, this is true for influenza A viruses (IAVs). The sustained circulation of IAVs and often poor biosecurity provides great opportunity for swine IAVs to reassort or recombine with avian or human IAVs, which can result in novel progeny-virus zoonotic transmission events [7, 8] .

Despite these elevated titers, the longitudinal data still showed that CAFO swine workers had a significantly higher risk of seroconverting against swine H1N1, compared to non-CAFO swine workers (OR 20.11, 95% CI 3.62-380.34) and unexposed participants (OR 17.89, 95% CI 3.12-342.01). This is similar to results from a longitudinal study of swine workers in Iowa, which found that swine-exposed individuals (OR 54.9, 95% CI 13.0-232.6)-and even their nonexposed spouses (OR 28.2, 95% CI 6.1-130.1)had a higher risk of seroconverting against swine H1N1 virus than other, nonexposed individuals [13] . While exposed participants were not found to be at a higher risk of seroconversion against swine H3N2 virus, the ORs trended in that direction, and we present evidence that suggests some of this effect may be due to cross-reactivity with the seasonal H3N2 virus in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 109, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 201, "end": 205, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 885, "end": 889, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Although complete case analyses are known to be biased when the data are not missing completely at random, there are several reasons our analysis is justified here.

Participants observed at only 2 time points are similarly Sera samples were collected from 116 participants who were exposed to swine and 71 who were not exposed to swine (unexposed) in the Shandong and Jiangsu provinces of China between March 2015 and December 2017. Swine-exposed participants were either enrolled at CAFO facilities (exposed to CAFO swine) or at non-CAFO facilities (not exposed to CAFO swine), including house-holding swine farms, abattoirs, a veterinary station, and an animal market. Samples were collected at each of 3 time points (0, 12, and 24 months), with additional acute and convalescent sera samples collected at individually reported influenza-like illness events between follow-up visits.

Among these participants, the most intensively swine-exposed participants (CAFO swine workers) had higher titers against swine H1N1 virus and yet higher odds of seroconversion during follow-up to both swine H1N1 and the swine H3N2 viruses. While some of this risk of seroconversion against swine H3N2 could likely be explained by cross-reactivity against human H3N2 IAV, these data support the premise that persons with intense occupational exposure to pigs are at high risk (ORs ranging from 17-20, depending upon the occupational comparison group) of infection with enzootic swine viruses.
