Twitter is the most popular form of social media used for ID communication. We will review the power of Twitter in ID. Recent Findings Twitter allows for real-time sharing of educational resources at ID scientific conferences, enabling individuals that are not able to attend conferences to follow conferences anytime anywhere and stimulate discussion around topics of interest with experts from across the globe. Further, Twitter chats are a valuable tool for stewardship, with different accounts periodically hosting chats on various stewardship topics. Several studies have also demonstrated the strong relationship between dissemination and citation impact of publications with the help of Twitter. There is great value in engaging with non-ID people on Twitter via dissemination of ID knowledge to other disciplines. Lastly, when used appropriately, Twitter is a useful site for distributing vaccine information, whether informally (by advocates and physicians) or formally (by government entities) and allows one to keep up with ongoing ID outbreaks in real time. Summary Twitter has transformed how we communicate in healthcare. Particularly in ID, where bacteria and viruses can enter/ exit borders anytime anywhere, global real-time information about outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance for clinicians and the public is critical. Twitter has no hierarchy or barriers, is a conduit for global collaboration, and is a way for HCPs and the public to \"social\"ize on healthcare topics, if used appropriately.",

However, realtime communication is critical to both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and the public to distribute medical alerts and information. Currently, Twitter is the most popular form of social media used for healthcare communication [4] . Twitter (founded in July 2006) is a microblogging version of a social media site where users interact in real time via posts (\"tweets\") containing up to 280 characters; hashtags (#) within these posts allow aggregation of tweets into topics. Users interact with each other through updates, direct messaging, replies, likes, and retweeting, which is the reposting of specific messages. There is no permission needed to follow a user, and reciprocation of following is not required. In its first-quarter statistics for 2019, Twitter declared 330 million active monthly users [5] . Twitter has become a daily part of many HCPs' lives, with 152 million people daily users, allowing them to communicate real-time healthcare information and medical alerts to a large global audience, including those who are considered experts or thought leaders in a particular field, and to solicit feedback [5] .",

The role of Twitter in infectious diseases has been previously studied, with Twitter being useful in monitoring the spread of the swine flu (H1N1) outbreak, which was declared a pandemic in 2009, as well as studying and identifying the misuse of antibiotics [6] . During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, from July 24, 2014-August 1, 2014 (9 days), 42,236 tweets mentioning Ebola were posted and disseminated to 9,362,267,048 people in real time, spreading breaking health news, with most of these tweets sent 3 days before the official outbreak announcements [7] . With the USA being at the brink of losing its measles elimination status in 2019, Twitter served as a powerful platform to disseminate correct information about vaccines [8] . Most recently, with the coronavirus (COVID19) outbreak in 2020, Twitter enabled the public and HCPs to stay up-to-date on the case and death numbers worldwide, as the world inched closer to another pandemic. Twitter has also been crucial for engaging, educating, and advocating for the global public health crisis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [9, 10] . Accordingly, in this review, we will highlight the value of Twitter in infectious diseases, providing research studies and relevant examples from Twitter.",

At the 2014 annual Making a Difference in Infectious Diseases conference, which is focused on providing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) educational topics for physicians and pharmacists, a workshop on Twitter for Infectious Diseases Healthcare Providers was held. The conference planners registered the hashtag #MADID14 with the Healthcare Hashtag Project [11] . Individuals at the conference signed up for Twitter and then learned how to follow each other and tweet live from the conference. A total of 235 participants sent 1482 tweets during the 3-day conference. Attendees were able to connect with thought leaders and, more importantly, sustain the connection through Twitter after the meeting. Further, tweets incorporating the hashtag #asm2012, representing the meeting of the American Society of Microbiology, became so popular that it was listed as a \"trending\" topic on the Twitter home page [12] . When the Oral versus Intravenous Antibiotics for Bone and Joint Infection (OVIVA) study was first presented at the 2017 European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Disease (ECCMID) [13] , clinicians from around the world, whether they were at the conference or not, were able to see the presented slides years before the study was even published and without traveling to Europe. Since publication of the trial [14] , the authors have engaged with individuals on Twitter to answer questions about the results of the study. In effect, Twitter allows for quick real-time sharing of educational resources at conferences, enabling individuals that are not able to attend the conference to follow the conference from a distance at any time and stimulating discussion around topics of interest with experts from across the globe. With the help of Twitter, learning is no longer restricted by the time or geographical limitations of the conference.",

Further, Mary Millard contracted a Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection that caused her to go into septic shock. She was featured on the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Patient Stories and uses Twitter to engage people in the sepsis conservation and to increase people's knowledge of how AMR can gravely impact one's life.",

Reaching this level of attention is almost unheard of for most of the ID-related content on Twitter [19] . In 2019, for the first time in history, the World Health Organization (WHO) ranked vaccine hesitancy, a \"reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines,\" among the top ten global health threats, along with Ebola, HIV, and drug-resistant infections [20] . Twitter can serve as a useful site for dissemination of vaccine information, whether informally (by advocates and physicians) or formally (by government entities). One example of vaccine advocacy that has had remarkable influence is Jill Promoli's work, via her personal account (@jillpromoli) and her organization's site (@4jude4everyone, #ForJudeForEveryone). Promoli lost her son, Jude, to an influenza B infection in 2015 [21] and has since become an advocate for the influenza vaccination. In 2018 and 2019, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shared his influenza vaccination picture on Twitter, tagging Promoli and @4Jude4everyone in his picture [22, 23] . Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) similarly shared the #forjudeforeveryone hashtag in 2017, urging everyone to receive a flu shot [24] .",

In Samoa, a small Pacific island country of about 200,000 people, a measles outbreak exploded in late 2019, after a traveler from New Zealand entered the country in mid-August. The outbreak went undetected until mid-October, and then quickly spread through the population, which had a very low vaccination rate. By November 11, there had been 628 cases and 5 deaths; by January 6 of 2020, 5697 measles cases had been reported, with 83 deaths [25] . Twitter acted as both a repository of information and as an avenue to discuss the outbreak, for both the public and clinicians. The Government of Samoa (@samoagovt) tweeted out details of the outbreak almost daily beginning on November 22, adding additional information on their Facebook page (https://www. facebook.com/samoagovt). This allowed scientists and others on Twitter to discuss the outbreak developments in real time, to craft epidemic curves [26] , and to develop timelines of the outbreak in order to dispel the misinformation that the outbreak was caused by the vaccine [27] .",

Similarly, Twitter is the major social media platform for leading anti-vaccine organizations in the USA and remains a go-to site for convening anti-vaccine political activism and for promoting misinformation. Twitter's only pushback against such misinformation has been to redirect individuals searching for vaccine-associated keywords to a reputable site (vaccines.gov, run by the US Department of Health and Human Services) [32] . Unfortunately, the anti-vaccine movement has gained traction and doubt in vaccines has grown [33] , in part because of misguided tweets and the anti-vaccine posts not being policed by the site and not reportable as a group.",

Even when misinformation is corrected, the mere exposure to such material may cause it to spread [34] . As such, countering misinformation should be performed with consideration. Additionally, those tweeting pro-vaccine information are vulnerable to attacks by antivaccine activists and/or bots. A pediatrician was recently the center of attacks after posting a TikTok video, a video-sharing app, encouraging vaccination on Twitter. It took less than 24 h for the video to go viral on both TikTok and Twitter-and just another 48 h before the physician was facing backlash and death threats from people associated with the anti-vaccine movement [35] . Recently, an account was developed in order to \"rally the troops\" in support of an individual under attack by anti-vaccine accounts: @shotsheard. [36] Conclusions The use of social media platforms such as Twitter has transformed the manner in which we communicate on both a personal and professional level. The way we stay up-to-date has mirrored these advancements. Particularly in infectious diseases, where bacteria and viruses can enter and exit borders anytime anywhere, global real-time information about outbreaks and AMR for both clinicians and the public is critical. Twitter has no hierarchy or barriers, serves as a conduit for global collaboration, and is a way for both HCPs and the public to \"social\"ize on healthcare topics, if used appropriately.",
