Introducers Cook \u00ae 8x45mm and Cook \u00ae 76 7x45mm (Cook Medical Inc, Bloomington, Indiana, US) were placed in the left and right CFA 77 respectively. The right renal artery was engaged from the left access with a 6F catheter. On the right 78 side, the introducer was switched with a Gore \u00ae 18F introducer (Gore & Ass, Flagstaff, Arizona, 79 US) and an angiogram was performed, showing aortic rupture right above the left renal artery 80 (LRA), which was barely visible (fig.4). Due to the shrinkage of the left kidney, it was decided that 81 the left renal artery could be sacrificed and only the right renal artery (RRA) was revascularized. On 82 a guide wire V18, two Viabhan \u00ae 7x50mm and 8x100mm (Gore & Ass, Flagstaff, Arizona, US) 83 were placed in the RRA.

Completion angiography showed absence of leak and patency of the CT, SMA 102 and RRA (fig.8). 103After awakening and extubation, the patient was stable and in good clinical conditions and was 104 transferred to the Internal Medicine Ward for an observation period due to the COVID-19 105 pneumonia, which showed a stepwise but constant recovery during the post-operative course 106 (improvement of the lung translucency at the chest X-ray on post-operative day XII and drop of cof complex AAAs involving the renal arteries, whether with fenestrated, 112 branched endografts or parallel grafting, has been largely validated in the latest years, and it has 113 proven safe and effective, provided that adequate surgical expertise and suitable endovascular 114 materials are available.2 Those conditions still limit the feasibility of EVAR of pararenal aneurysms 115 in emergent settings, especially in case of free rupture and hemodynamic instability, with little time 116 for accurate planning and sizing and often lack of the optimal endograft size. 3 In those situations, 117 open repair is still considered the treatment of choice, despite the heavy burden of possible 118 complications in a high-risk patient, as in this case: in fact, open repair would have required delayed 119 conversion of the previous EVAR with endograft explant, and the presence of a left colostomy, 120 midline laparocele and intraperitoneal hematoma, would have made the access to the aorta 121 extremely difficult and time-consuming, with a considerable damage of the respiratory mechanism 122 and a prolonged condition of respiratory distress. The patient was actually asymptomatic for 123 respiratory infection, but the imaging and lab tests showed clear signs of a moderate-to-severe 124 involvement of the pulmonary area and initial signs of systemic involvement. Although no specific 125 indication has been given yet about the management of COVID-19 patients warranting urgent aortic 126 surgery, the consequences of laparotomy on the respiratory system are well known, especially in 127 already compromised patients, and so is the great advantage of EVAR over open aortic surgery in 128 terms of pulmonary involvement 4 ; therefore the advanced endovascular treatment was the most 129 reasonable choice, even in absence of a wide selection of endovascular materials covering all 130 possible sizes. Parallel grafting has already been described in semi-urgent, urgent and even 131 emergent settings, with satisfactory outcomes, including lower mortality and lower complication 132 rate and shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, and its role can result even more precious now, in 133 order to avoid open surgery in COVID-19 patients. 3 In this respect, the importance of having a wide 134 variety of endovascular devices stored in the hospital warehouse is crucial, since it offers the 135 possibility to treat safely many and different types of aortic diseases and anatomic configurations, 136 not only in urgency, but also in elective settings, since supplies could be delayed due to the 137 lockdown and other measures to contain the viral spread. 138 In the present case, a longer proximal neck could have been obtained by performing a chimney graft 139 on the SMA from the beginning, which would have spared the patients the second intervention, but 140 the emergent conditions of the patients (hemorrhagic shock with hemodynamic instability) made it 141 preferable to try for a quicker and less invasive treatment. That was in fact successful in excluding 142 the aneurysm and stop the intraperitoneal hemorrhage, as demonstrated by the hemodynamic 143 stabilization and the CTA, and made it possible to perform the reintervention on a stable patient, in 144 non-emergent setting. Although EVAR is at high risk for late failure and complications, and despite 145 being technically demanding due to the parallel grafting, endovascular repair appears in those cases 146 the treatment of choice, because it represents the safest and quickest way to stop the hemorrhage 147 preserving the respiratory function. In fact, not only did the patient regain his consciousness and 148 hemodynamic stability shortly after the end of the procedure, but he was also extubated and has had 149 no further need for ventilatory support so far. Moreover, endovascular repair avoided post-operative 150 ICU stay, which would have been necessary in case of open repair, in a moment of dramatic 151 shortage of beds due to the critically ill COVID-19 patients. The outbreak of COVID-19 in Northern Italy, in fact, has imposed the conversion of many hospitals, including ours, in COVID-19 153 dedicated centers, with only little resources available for the management of other urgencies. 154",

The main suggestions that can be drawn from this 182 regard the benefits of endovascular surgery, even in absence of adequate materials, the importance 183 of keeping a well-supplied warehouse and early systemic anticoagulation prior to surgery. Minimal 184 invasivity and prevention of the complications, in fact, are the key to manage the vascular urgency 185 and avoid progression of the infection, that can evolve from pneumonia to multi-organ failure.
