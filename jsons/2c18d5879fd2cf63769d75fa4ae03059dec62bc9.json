            "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has significantly altered our lifestyles as we resort to minimize the spread through preventive measures such as social distancing and quarantine. An increasingly worrying aspect is the gap between the exponential disease spread and the delay in adopting preventive measures. This gap is attributed to the lack of awareness about the disease and its preventive measures. Nowadays, social media platforms (i.e., Twitter) are frequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In this paper, we use Twitter to characterize public awareness regarding COVID-19 by analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that, we collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from the top twenty most affected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related trends, 2) the volume of tweets and recurring topics in those trends, and 3) the user sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that countries with a lower pandemic spread generated a higher volume of trends and tweets to expedite the information flow and contribute to public awareness. We also observed that in those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated before the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a preemptive attempt to notify users about the potential threat. Finally, we noticed that in countries with a lower spread, users had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19 preventive measures. Our measurements and analysis show that effective social media usage can influence public behavior, which can be leveraged to better combat future pandemics.",

            "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has spread across the world with over four million reported cases to date. Currently, no vaccine is available for the SARS-CoV-2 strain, and therefore the optimal way to curtail its spread is to avoid physical contact with COVID-19 carriers. To minimize the physical contact, people are advised to practice social distancing, stay at home, and in the worst case, undergo a lockdown (Broniec et al. 2020; Inoue and Todo 2020) . Unfortunately, despite these guidelines, COVID-19 has spread faster than the adoption of preventive measures. The gap between the spread and the adoption of preventive measures is due to 1) limited awareness about the disease and its spread, 2) Copyright c 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. the nature of the disease and its latent symptoms (Robson 2020) , and 3) delayed response in taking corrective measures by governments and the general public. Particularly, the aspect of public awareness largely depends on the information spread through the mainstream media and the social media (Wells et al. 2020; Le, Shafiq, and Srinivasan 2017; Brena et al. 2019) . Between these two axes of communication, social media platforms (i.e., Twitter and Facebook) are highly useful in propagating timely information regarding a major event (Bin Tareaf et al. 2018) . Therefore, it is intuitive to assume that social media platforms contain information footprints that can be leveraged to characterize the response of various communities to the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, this study uses Twitter data to analyze various attributes of information exchange in order to model preparations of various countries for the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We perform topic modeling and sentiment analysis on tweets to analyze the user response towards preventive measures such as social distancing, quarantine, and lockdown. Our dataset reveals meaningful insights, including a correlation between frequent trending on COVID-19 and effective pandemic management. To illustrate this observation, we provide a comparative case study of six countries (USA, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Austria, and Belgium), which indicates that countries with a lower pandemic spread usually generated more tweets and trends about COVID-19 and its preventive measures. We believe that the key takeaways of our work highlight the importance of social media in influencing public interactions that can be useful in combating future pandemics. Contributions and Roadmap. We take a systematic approach towards analyzing the temporal evolution of Twitter trends in 20 most affected countries by COVID-19. Our data collection, methodology, and results are summarized below as the key contributions. 1 We develop a large-scale data collection system that sidesteps the Twitter API limitations and collects a large volume of tweets and trends from various countries. We collect more than 48K trends and over 622 Million tweets from December 15, 2019, to April 5, 2020, for the top 20 countries affected by For each country, we identify the COVID-19 related trends among all trends and the volume of tweets in those trends. We pair that information with key indicators in the country's COVID-19 timeline to study their preparatory status. 3 We present a case study of six countries (United States, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Austria, and Belgium) to a) show the variation in response of each country to the pandemic, and b) showcase observations that suggest that frequent and timely information propagation about preventive measures correlated with a lower pandemic spread. Notably, our results show that on average, Sweden, Austria, and Belgium generated more trends and tweets about COVID-19 and its preventive measures than the United States, Italy, and Spain. 4 Additionally, we apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the most prevalent topics in the COVID-19 tweets and the user senti-ment towards those topics. We observed that countries with a lower pandemic spread frequently used terms related to the preventive measures such as \"social distancing.\"",

For each country, we collected all their Twitter trends from December 15, 2019, to April 5, 2020, . Figure 1 shows our data collection system, and below, we briefly discuss some key challenges that we encountered during the process. Collecting Historical Trends. A trend on Twitter generally indicates a commonly discussed topic by users in a location (Tulasi et al. 2019) . Logically, on a specific date, if all trends of a location are collected, we can estimate the commonly discussed topics in that region. As such, the first challenge in our study was to obtain all the historical trends of the selected countries. Twitter API does not provide historical trends for countries, and therefore, we relied on third-party services for trend collection. We used an online service called Trendogate that maintains historical Twitter trends for all countries (TrendoGateCommunity 2020). We developed a crawler that periodically scraped trends of each country and stored them in our \"Data Storage and Scheduler\" platform. For validation, we cross-examined those trends with an Internet archive service called \"Wayback Machine\" (ArchiveCommunity 2020). The \"Wayback Machine\" creates snapshots of a vast majority of the Internet webpages every day. Currently, the archive contains historical data of more than 330 billion web pages. After crossexamining and validating data, our 'Data Storage and Scheduler\" platform created a list of Trends for twenty crawlers that we deployed for tweet collection (Figure 1 ). Collecting Tweets from Trends. We developed twitter crawlers and deployed them on twenty machines for concurrent data collection. We could not use the Twitter API Figure 2 : Distribution of trends shown as a violin plot for each country in our dataset. On average, India had the most trends, followed by Italy, Germany, and Turkey. In contrast, Portugal, Israel, and Sweden had the least number of trends. Violinplot shows the smooth distribution of data as a result. The result of the smoothing function can exceed the maximum and minimum value. As such, this should not be confused with the negative number of trends for the countries shown in the figure. Table 1 : Results from data collection. Each country is ranked based on the total number of COVID-19 cases as of April 19, 2020. Note that 1) India generated the highest trends, 2) Switzerland generated the highest COVID-19 trends, the highest overall tweets, 3) Ireland generated the highest tweets before the first case, 4) Belgium generated highest tweets before the first death, 5) Switzerland generated the highest COVID-19 tweets, and 6) Turkey generated the highest number of trends before the first case and the first death. Percentages are reported relative to the total number trends and the total number of tweets. since the API only provides the recent tweets from a trend.",

In most cases, the number of tweets decreased while the number of cases kept growing. 2 A few countries (i.e., Sweden and Austria) preemptively responded to the pandemic by actively discussing COVID-19 before the increase in the number of cases. 3 In some countries (i.e., Austria), we observed a constant recurrence in tweets and trends, indicating consistency of interest on the subject. To take a deeper look at these observations, we present a case study below. Case Study. For the case study, we selected the top three countries from Table 1 , namely the United States, Spain, and Italy, and three other countries at random, namely Sweden, Austria, and Belgium. In the United States, the first COVID- 19 case was reported on January 21, 2020, and by April 5, 2020, the number of cases exceeded 300K. Similarly, for Spain and Italy, the first case was reported on January 31, and the total number of cases increased to 132K and 18K by April 5, respectively. For Sweden, Austria, and Belgium, the first case was reported on February 4, February 24, and February 4, while the total cases increased to 6K, 12K, and 100K by April 5, respectively. For simplicity of analysis, we divide these countries into two sets where the set S 1 consists of the United States, Spain, and Italy, and the set S 2 consists of Sweden, Austria, and Belgium. Note that 1) all the first cases in S 1 were reported earlier than the first cases reported in S 2 , and 2) by April 05, the total number of cases in S 1 were much higher than the total number of cases in S 2 . We analyzed the temporal behavior of Twitter trends in S 1 and S 2 . For both sets, we apply algorithm 1 to obtain the 1) the timeline of tweets in COVID-19 related trends, and 2) the total number of tweets about COVID-19. We sepa-rate tweets into two categories because the text in a tweet may or may not be associated with a COVID-19 trend. To understand this phenomenon, assume that an ongoing trend in a country is #COVID-19. A user in that country tweets, \"Today, we have reported ten new cases of #COVID-19.\" This tweet will appear in the #COVID-19 trend and the trend will appear in our list of terms related to COVID-19. In contrast, if an ongoing trend in a country is #Football-Match and a user tweets \"#FootballMatch has been canceled due to coronavirus,\" then the tweet will not appear in the COVID-19 related trends. However, the tweet will match in our list of terms related to COVID-19. The first example shows that COVID-19 is an actively discussed topic in a country since it appears among trends. If we sample all tweets related to COVID-19 related trends, we can estimate the significance of the topic in the country. However, this method may not capture complete information about tweets related to COVID-19, as demonstrated in the second exam- Overall, coronavirus is among the common terms in all countries. In Sweden and Austria, quarantine, social distancing, and lockdown are also prevalent.",

Therefore, apart from acquiring a holistic view through COVID-19 trends, we also construct a complete picture by collecting all COVID-19 tweets from all trends, irrespective of the trend nature. The second method allows us to precisely determine the number of times the COVID-19 was discussed by people in a country. We use algorithm 1 to extract this information. We report our results in Figure 3 where Figure 3 (a) shows the total number of tweets related to COVID-19 trends and Figure 3( b) shows the total number of COVID-19 tweets among all trends. The total number of tweets in both figures also include the number of retweets. Key Takeaways. Our results show that countries in S 2 generated COVID-19 related tweets and trends before countries in S 1 , indicating a preemptive attempt to cause pandemic awareness. In the entire evaluation timeline, all countries in S 2 generated more COVID-19 tweets than countries in S 1 . We also observed spikes in Figure 3 , showcasing a surge in the number of tweets and trends. In all noticeable spikes, S 2 clearly dominated S 1 , indicating a higher user engagement towards COVID-19. Among all countries, Switzerland generated the highest number of COVID-19 tweets (\u22487.3 Million) and the highest number of COVID-19 trends (272). The inner plot in Figure 3 (a) shows that number of daily trends in S 2 were considerably higher than S 1 . Notably, in Belgium, 15 COVID-19 trends were generated on March 19, 2020. These results show that countries in S 2 effectively utilized Twitter to propagate information among users and prepare them for the pandemic.",

We then tokenized the text corpus, removed the stop words, and calculated the frequency count over the resulting text. Finally, we assigned weights to all the topics and sorted them in descending order. In Figure 4 , we show word clouds for each country, providing an intuitive overview of the most commonly used terms in COVID-19 tweets.

We eliminated tweets with a neutral score of \"0\" to focus purely on tweets with a positive or negative sentiment. Additionally, we applied the kernel density function to aggregate tweets with the same sentiment score and observed the distribution shape of each class. We report our results in Figure 5 . Our results show that for social distancing and quarantine; generally, the sentiment across all countries was within the same margin. For social distancing, almost all countries had a close to neutral sentiment, as indicated by a spike around 0.1 Figure 5(a) . However, we also observed a small spike towards the positive sentiment in Belgium and Sweden. Similarly, for the quarantine class, we noticed a spike of around 0.3 for all countries, indicating a more positive response. For the lockdown class, we observed a relatively higher sentiment variation. In Italy, the sentiment was distributed towards the negative side, with a spike around -0.1 Figure 5 (c). However, in Austria and Belgium, the sentiment was allocated towards the positive side with peaks around 0.9. In summary, our data show that the general response to social distancing and quarantine was similar across all countries. However, for lockdown, we observed a variation in response with Italy's inclination towards a negative sentiment. In summary, the general sentiment on social distancing and quarantine, across all countries, converged to a similar score in the density distribution. This observation reflects a sense of uniformity in expression for all countries. However, for lockdown, the variation in score indicates a divergence in expression towards it. This could be a result of societal pressures operating in those countries which we could not capture in our dataset. Perhaps a more precise coupling of sentiment with the increasing number of cases will provide reasoning for the sentiment divergence. In the future, we plan to explore this direction and get more meaningful results to support the observation.",

First, we indeed noticed variations in the response of different countries to the COVID-19 pandemic as shown by the 1) volume of trends and tweets and their timeline, 2) recurring topics discussed in those tweets, and 3) sentiments towards preventive measures. Second, we also observed indications to support that awareness through Twitter contributed in influencing the pandemic spread. For that purpose, we outlined a case study to showcase that users in the highly affected countries displayed lower Twitter engagement compared to the lesser affected countries. Please note that this is not a conclusive statement to suggest that Twitter usage was the dominant factor in influencing the pandemic spread. However, our data and analysis indicate that Twitter can be useful for this purpose, and therefore noteworthy. Future Work. At the time of conducting this study, we did not find a study that precisely analyzed the relationship between Twitter and the spread of COVID-19. However, our methodology is inspired from some notable studies that examined the usefulness of Twitter in characterizing the user behavior at scale. We have mentioned them in \u00a71. Concurrent to work, we have seen a study that analyzed the emergence of Sinophobic behavior due to COVID-19 (Schild et al. 2020 ). However, our work investigates an entirely different relationship between Twitter and COVID-19.",

KDE calculates summation, after each data-point is smoothed into small density bumps.",
