If pressure readings are not obtained, CSF may be collected directly from the spinal needle hub by dripping into a test tube or gentle aspiration of drops as they collect at the hub using a syringe. Attachment of a syringe to the needle with aspiration of CSF is not recommended because suction may result in contamination with blood or meningeal cells or obstruction of CSF flow by aspirated meningeal trabeculae. Careful aspiration is acknowledged to be necessary for collections in some cases. Passage of the needle through the spinal cord to underlying bone should be avoided at the cerebellomedullary cistern because it may cause damage to the cord and/or cause blood contamination of the CSF sample.

Sometimes no fluid or only a very small amount of fluid can be obtained owing to the small size of the lumbar subarachnoid space. Lumbar puncture may be preferred in cases with localized spinal disease because it may be more likely to confirm abnormality than cerebellomedullary cistern collections (Thomson et al., 1990).",

The likelihood of misinterpretation due to sample deterioration depends on the initial protein concentration of the sample and how long analysis is delayed. For example, if the CSF protein concentration is >50 mg/dl, a delay in analysis of <12 hours is unlikely to alter final interpretation. Addition of an equal volume of 4% to 10% neutral buffered formalin or 50% to 90% alcohol is recommended for fixation of specimens that cannot be immediately delivered to a laboratory and processed immediately (Carmichael, 1998). Alternatively, the addition of one drop of 10% formalin to 1 to 2 mL of CSF may be used to preserve cells for cell counts and morphologic examination when submitted to a referral laboratory, keeping in mind that cell counts will be affected but may not be clinically significant. Refrigeration will help retard cellular degeneration. Cellular stability can be increased by addition of fresh, frozen, or thawed serum or plasma (Bienzle et al., 2000) or by addition of 20% albumin (Fenner, 2000). If a CSF sample is not analyzed within 1 hour from collection, Fry and co-workers (2006) recommend to divide the fluid into 2 aliquots, an unadulterated aliquot for total nucleated cell count and protein measurement and an aliquot added with 20% of fetal calf serum (or 10% autologous serum) for differential cell count and morphologic evaluation. For those samples of insufficient volume (<0.5 mL total), hetastarch (1:1) can be added to CSF for all routine assays. In the last situation, the dilutional effect of adding a stabilizing agent must be taken into account when calculating results. Protein and enzyme concentrations in CSF are relatively stable, and submission to the laboratory by routine delivery, postal delivery, or courier is usually sufficient for accurate determinations (Carmichael, 1998).",

Rand (1995) indicates that red blood cell (RBC) counts greater than 30 cells/\u03bcl in CSF will have a profound effect on the total and differential cell counts. However, in a study (Hurtt and Smith, 1997) of iatrogenic blood contamination effects of total protein and nucleated cell counts in CSF, the RBC count was not significantly correlated with nucleated cell count or protein concentration in CSF from clinically normal dogs or those with neurologic disease. The study concluded that high CSF nucleated cell counts and protein concentrations are indicative of neurologic disease, even if samples contain up to 13,200 RBC/\u03bcl. Although blood contamination may make interpretation of CSF more difficult, red or pink CSF or CSF with a high RBC count should not be discarded as a useless specimen because cytologic evaluation may detect abnormalities (Chrisman, 1992).",

However, changes in CSF glucose concentration in serum or plasma are not immediately reflected in CSF and may take 1 to 3 hours before they are apparent in CSF (Cook and DeNicola, 1988). The ratio between blood glucose and CSF glucose is frequently reduced in bacterial infections of the CNS in humans and has been reported to occur in some cases of pyogenic infections of the CNS, CSF hemorrhage, or blood contamination that may result in increased utilization of glucose by cells. However, the relationship between bacterial encephalitis and decreased CSF glucose compared with serum or plasma glucose may depend on multiple factors, including the blood glucose level, degree of permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and presence or absence of glycolytic cells or microorganisms. Fenner (2000) states that the reduction in glucose does not occur in dogs. Significant reductions in CSF glucose concentrations have been reported in human malignant disorders involving the leptomeninges and it is considered a relatively specific finding for this condition (Chamberlain, 1995).",

The main neurologic signs are depression, tetraparesis, head tilt, nystagmus, and intention tremor (Baroni and Heinold, 1995). It accounted for 44% of 61 feline cases of inflammatory CNS disease (Rand et al., 1994). Parent and Rand (1994) indicate that marked neutrophilic pleocytosis with a nucleated count of more than 100 cells/\u03bcl and neutrophils greater than 50% is commonly seen with FIP, along with increased CSF protein (usually greater than 200 mg/dl). They indicate a high probability of FIP if a cat is less than 4 years of age and shows multifocal neurologic signs referable to the cerebellum and/or brainstem, protracted course of illness, and CSF protein greater than 200 mg/dl. Later in the course of the disease, a mixed cellular population may be found with large mononuclear cells and lymphocytes present to a significant degree (Fig. 14-7A&B\n). Similar results were found by Singh and others (2005) in a series of 11 cats with FIP. CSF analysis in that study was characterized as suppurative in seven cats, mixed in one, and mononuclear in three. Five cats had marked elevations in the CSF white cells count (>1000 cells/\u03bcl), three cats had moderate elevations (51 to 1000 calls/\u03bcl), two cats had mild elevations (6 to 50 cells/\u03bcl), and one cat had insufficient sample for a white cells count.",

Bacteria are not observed or cultured and improvement is often seen within 72 hours following glucocorticoid administration; long-term prognosis is good. One report investigated the immunologic response in these cases finding IgG and IgA synthesis intrathecally and suggested the humoral response is primary, rather than the result of a generalized immune complex disease (Tipold et al., 1995). In another more recent paper Behr and Cauzinille (2006) evaluated clinical findings and prognosis in a series of 12 cases of aseptic suppurative meningitis in juvenile Boxers of which 10 of the dogs exhibited the acute form of the disease and had more than 100 nucleated cells/\u03bcl with neutrophils ranging from 72% to 100%. The two other dogs presented with a more chronic form that produced a mixed pleocytosis, with neutrophils about 60% of total nucleated cells. An abnormal cell count of mixed cell population or mononuclear cells in the CSF are seen in the protracted form, and monitoring of CSF cell count in dogs with this condition seems to be a sensitive indicator of success of treatment (Cizinauskas et al., 2000).",

Mononuclear pleocytosis was noted in two cats with cuterebriasis (Glass et al., 1998) and in another cat with cerebral cholesterol granuloma (Fluhemann et al., 2006). The appearance of CSF macrophages containing vacuoles and pink-purple amorphous granular material in a young cat with mononuclear pleocytosis, elevated protein content, seizures, incoordination, and tremors indicated the presence of a lysosomal storage disease (GM2-gangliosidosis) (Johnsrude et al., 1996).

            "text": "\nGranulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (GME) (Fig. 14-19\n) is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the CNS in primarily young to middle-aged female dogs (Sorjonen, 1990). A study of 42 dogs found a high percentage of affected animals were toy or terrier breeds (Munana and Luttgen, 1998). Clinical signs of fever, ataxia, tetraparesis, cervical hyperesthesia, and seizures have been reported. Designation of the clinical signs into focal or multifocal was helpful in determining prognosis, with dogs having focal clinical signs surviving longer. Lesions are histologically found in both white and gray matter of the brain and predominantly the white matter of the caudal brainstem and spinal cord. The CSF may have a mild to moderate lymphocytic, mixed cell pleocytosis, or occasionally neutrophilic predominance (Chrisman, 1992). Nucleated cell counts had a median of 250 cells/\u03bcl (range 0 to 11,840) with the majority having counts greater than 100 cells/\u03bcl (Munana and Luttgen, 1998). In this same study, dogs with multifocal signs all had pleocytosis, whereas some of the dogs with focal signs had normal cell counts. The predominant cell type was lymphocytic (52%), monocytic (21%), neutrophilic (10%), and mixed cell (17%). CSF protein is variably elevated, with a mean value of 256 mg/dl (range 13 to 1119) as reported by Bailey and Higgins (1986). Differentiation must be made from infectious diseases and idiopathic necrotizing encephalitis, all of which may appear similar cytologically. Electrophoretic separation of CSF proteins in GME has shown increases in the alpha and beta globulin fractions (Sorjonen, 1990); however, these fractions are generally decreased in canine distemper (Chrisman, 1992). Both GME and canine distemper may have increased gamma globulins. GME lesions involve widely disseminated perivascular, lymphocytic-granulomatous meningeal, and parenchymal infiltrates. Necrosis and demyelination are major features in necrotizing encephalitis and may be present to a minor extent in GME. GME cases with lesions that involve the caudal brainstem or spinal cord progress slowly, permitting longer survival. Radiation has been recommended as an adjunct to treatment, especially in dogs with focal clinical signs. The disease is poorly responsive to glucocorticoids, although an immune-mediated etiology has been suggested (Kipar et al., 1998). In this study, it was determined that the GME inflammatory lesions are composed of predominantly CD3 antigen\u2013positive T-lymphocytes and a heterogeneous population of activated macrophages with MHC class II expression suggesting a T-cell\u2013mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity of an organ-specific autoimmune disease.",

Cell counts may be variable, ranging from normal to greater than 50 cells/\u03bcl, and lymphocytes represent the predominant cell population, accounting for greater than 60% of the cells present. One report (Abate et al, 1998) indicated that the CSF in distemper cases had an increase in macrophages, an increase in total protein concentration, an increase of the gamma-globulin fraction by electrophoretic separation, and the presence of cellular inclusions. Another report from Amude et al (2006) describes a marked CSF pleocytosis (554 cells/\u03bcl) with protein content within normal limits in a 7-month-old dog with PCR-confirmed viral distemper. In this case, the nucleated cell differential count was 70% lymphocytes, 25% neutrophils, and 5% monocytes. Diagnosis of canine distemper often involves suggestive history, clinical signs, and evidence of serum or CSF IgM in response to active infection by canine distemper virus. In addition, RT-PCR on CSF is considered a useful, fast, and specific method to diagnose canine distemper virus infection (Amude et al., 2006).",

Well-differentiated lymphoid malignancies may not be readily distinguished from a lymphocytic pleocytosis involving granular lymphocytes (Fig. 14-32A&B\n). Other round cell tumors (Sheppard et al., 1997; Greenberg et al., 2004) are less common and include encephalic and spinal plasma cell tumors (Fig. 14-33A-C\n), histiocyticappearing neoplasms (Fig. 14-33D) that are difficult to distinguish from GME (Zimmerman et al., 2006). Medulloblastoma should be considered as another differential diagnosis for atypical round cells in the CSF of young dogs (Thompson et al., 2003). Rarely, individualized cells from choroid plexus papillomas may be found in the CSF as large round cells (see discussion later under \u201cNeoplasms of Neuroepithelial Cells\u201d).",

The real number of extensions of these specialized structures cannot be evaluated by MGG stain, as special stains are needed for this purpose. All neurons have a very large, centrally placed nucleus and frequently a single, prominent nucleolus. The cytoplasm is usually abundant and granular, due to the presence of Nissl substance, the rough endoplasmic reticulum often so abundant as to obscure the nucleus. In some areas of the brain, the cytoplasm may contain melanin pigments (neuromelanin) and microvacuoles (neuromediators). Smears from the cerebellar cortex have a highly characteristic appearance as the cellularity is usually higher than in the brain cortex with sheets of small, hyperchromatic granular cells (Fig. 14-37A\n) from the inner, granular layer that are occasionally intermixed with large Purkinje cells (Fig. 14-37B).",

            "text": "Non-neuroepithelial tumors that arise from the arachnoid meningeal layer are termed meningiomas. These are the most common intracranial tumor in dogs and cats. The tumors are derived from leptomeningocytes that associate with neural crest tissue and have both epithelial and fibroblastic ultrastructural characteristics. As a result, these tumors have several variant forms (Montoliu et al., 2006) that are found both in cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord as well as intracranially and within the retrobulbar region (Zimmerman et al., 2000). Spinal cord meningiomas are mostly extramedullary but few reports note the radiographic presentation of them as intramedullary (Hopkins et al., 1995). According to Bailey and Higgins (1986), meningiomas had the highest prevalence of pleocytosis, with a predominance of neutrophils often associated with necrosis. The meningioma was unique of all the tumors reviewed in this study, being the only tumor with CSF nucleated cell counts greater than 50/\u03bcl. Nevertheless in a more recent work (Dickinson et al., 2006) pleocytosis was detected in only 27% of 56 dogs with confirmed intracranial meningioma, and pleocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils was detected in only 19% of dogs with the conclusion that neutrophilic pleocytosis, especially with total nucleated cells count greater than 50 cells/\u03bcl, was not typical in CSF samples from dogs with intracranial meningiomas. Myelography, MRI, and CT are imaging tools used currently to identify tumors of the brain and spinal cord. Fine-needle aspirations, crush preparations (De Lorenzi et al., 2006; Moissonier et al., 2002), and incisional cutting needles (Platt et al., 2002) have been used to obtain cytologic and tissue samples for biopsy. The cytologic features of meningiomas have been discussed in several reports (Zimmerman et al., 2000; Hopkins et al., 1995).",

Meningioma cells had round to slightly elongate, uniform-sized nuclei with a small, prominent nucleolus, diffusely coarse chromatin, and a well-defined nuclear border. Rarely there were intranuclear cytoplasmic evaginations, but these were plentiful in some individual tumor cells of the meningothelial subtype (Fig. 14-44A\n). More elongated cells sometimes had a central bar or fold through the longitudinal axis of their nucleus. There were variable amounts of eosinophilic, granular, wispy to solid cytoplasm that appeared round to elongate, often with a polar location. Mitotic figures were extremely rare.

            "text": "Neuroepithelial cells also include ependymal cells and choroid plexus cells. The ependymal cells line the ventricular system of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord. The ependymoma is a rare tumor (Fig. 14-55\n) that was reported in the cat with neoplastic cells found in the CSF with a moderately elevated protein content, mild pleocytosis, and macrophages as the predominant cell type along with evidence of chronic hemorrhage. The neoplastic cells were described as large cells having nuclear hyperchromatism, prominent nucleoli, and moderately abundant, highly basophilic agranular cytoplasm appearing singly and in clusters. An anaplastic ependymoma in a dog was diagnosed from partial positive staining with GFAP and vimentin but a negative reaction with S100, CD3, and cytokeratin (Fernandez et al., 1997). The choroid plexus cells represent a highly vascular portion of the pia mater that projects into the ventricles of the brain and is thought to secrete the CSF. Positive cytokeratin staining is expected in choroid plexus tumors. A cytologic example of a choroid plexus tumor is shown as an imprint of the tumor mass and within the CSF (Fig. 14-56A&B\n). The choroid plexus tumors were associated with an increased protein content and increased nucleated cell count in a study (Bailey and Higgins, 1986). These cells appear similar to mesothelial cells in the CSF, having a large, round nucleus with abundant, well-defined, deeply basophilic cytoplasm having surface projections (Fig. 14-56C). A papillary appearance with epithelial features can be seen in cytologic preparations of choroid plexus papilloma (Fig. 14-56A). Two choroid plexus carcinomas were cytologically misdiagnosed as choroid plexus papillomas (De Lorenzi et al., 2006). Both of these tumors occurred within a ventricular site and consisted of large, pedunculated, friable masses that presented cytologically as well-formed papillary structures, usually showing a fine fibrovascular core covered by uniform, cuboidal or columnar epithelium having minimal cytologic atypia with moderate pleomorphism (Fig. 14-57A\n). The final histologic diagnosis of carcinoma was made based of the presence of single-cell infiltration into the fibrovascular cores, suggesting that a definitive diagnosis of choroid plexus carcinoma can be made only after thorough histologic examination of the resected specimen (Fig. 14-57B).",

During the last decade, there has been an increased use of sophisticated imaging techniques with increased surgical investigation and surgical and medical treatment of neurologic disease. These trends indicate there may be opportunity to expand the use of nervous system cytology to include examination of fine-needle aspirates of lesions identified within the brain or spinal cord, ventricular fluids obtained by direct aspiration or by cannula, and squash preparations of small biopsy specimens or tissue fragments. All of these techniques are currently used in cytologic evaluations of human patients (Bigner, 1997) and to a limited extent in veterinary medicine (De Lorenzi et al., 2006; Moissoinier et al., 2002; Vernau et al., 2001). There may be increased demand and/or need for development of special preparative techniques such as cell blocks and immunocytochemistry for more precise identification of primary or metastatic tumors, inflammatory cell types, or immunophenotype of malignant or nonmalignant lymphoid proliferations.
