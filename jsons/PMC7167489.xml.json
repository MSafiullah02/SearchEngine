Hand hygiene is particularly critical for frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) who are overstretched and for whom this key routine task must be easy to complete and effective.1 However, a neglected aspect of hand hygiene, even in the absence of a global pandemic, is the risk of touching surfaces or objects that could recontaminate hands after hand rubbing or washing, whether gloves are worn or not. Infection prevention is key during this pandemic, and reducing hand recontamination is important to ensuring patient and HCW safety at all times.",

In a recent study in Tanzania during which 781 hand hygiene indications were observed, approximately half of the times when birth attendants rubbed or washed their hands, they then recontaminated their hands on potentially unclean surfaces before performing an aseptic procedure.3 Similar findings come from obstetric wards in Nigeria and Ghana.4,5 Recontamination is not only a problem in low-income settings. A US study demonstrated microbiological recontamination of hands at the point of care despite high levels of self-reported hand hygiene compliance.6 Reports from the United Kingdom and Australia show that HCWs touch privacy curtains between hand hygiene and touching a patient.7\n",

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced significant uncertainty into the care environment and thus workflow, including timing of necessary procedures, anticipating and managing patient volumes, and rapidly evolving guidelines on patient management. During this crisis, hand hygiene, along with other infection control activities, may be compromised, not because it is not a priority but rather because staff may be too busy or uncertain on how to implement hand hygiene in this outbreak setting. In their ethnography of infection prevention in Australia, Hor et al9 state that understanding the \u201cboundaries of what is clean\u201d is not straightforward in hospital departments and that HCWs have different perceptions over whether certain surfaces could potentially lead to cross transmission. Recontamination may be an indication that staff fail to understand the definition of the WHO hand hygiene recommendations or how those apply in rapidly changing healthcare settings.3\n",

Emerging evidence suggests that the virus responsible for the current pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) can survive on common surfaces for days, but viral demographics and characteristics have yet to be sufficiently studied.11 Recontamination of hands is a consequence and a source of poor surface cleanliness (Fig. 1, Steps 5 and 7).",

Following Michie\u2019s principles for behavior change during the COVID-19 pandemic,1 we recommend the following:1.A mental model: Training, monitoring, and feedback should include clear guidance for understanding the \u201cboundaries of what surfaces are clean\u201d with directions on what HCWs can and cannot touch within the patient zone (see the example in Fig. 1), in relation to hand hygiene, especially before a clean or aseptic procedure.2.Social norms: Managers and their colleagues should lead by example by demonstrating appropriate hand hygiene including avoiding recontamination. Hand hygiene protocols should be followed by everyone involved in patient care.3.Emotion: The importance of recontamination in patient and HCW safety needs to be clearly emphasized.4.Replace the behavior to stop the habit: \u201cKeep hands off unsafe surfaces\u201d rather than \u201cdo not touch unsafe surfaces.\u201d5.Make it easy: Create a user-friendly environment that facilitates hand hygiene and reduces opportunities for recontamination. The environment needs to account for the workflow for patient management, allowing for minimal opportunities to recontamination when collecting equipment or moving between patients. The environment should also include appropriate cues to remind and trigger hand hygiene, such as strategic placement of handrub dispensers.\n",
