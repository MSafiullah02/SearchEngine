It is hard to imagine, but this is true in Korea. It is estimated that there are 10 million separated families due to the divisions caused by the Korean War in 1950. Koreans, who have had over 5000 years of a unique national history and a common heritage, have lived under different political systems (South Korean Democracy vs. North Korean Communism) since 1945. However, since it is the supreme goal of the South Korean people, South Korean presidents have historically considered peaceful reunification a central national goal.",

Two distinct views in international politics, realism and liberalism, have influenced conceptual approaches to integration theory that can be defined as the creation of interdependence. Since the 1970s, functionalism, one of the approaches of integration theory proposed by Mitrany (1943) and redefined by Haas (1964), has been an influential theory in South Korea strategy toward North Korea to attain peace (Hong, 2005a). This theory has created the expectation of spill-over effects such as enlargement of activity scopes and heightened levels of commitment. Lindberg defined the effects as follows: \u201cin its most general formulation, \u2018spill-over\u2019 refers to a situation in which a given action, related to a specific goal, creates a situation in which the original goal can be assured only by taking further actions, which in turn create a further condition and a need for more action, and so forth\u201d (Lindberg, 1963, p. 10).",

Indeed, one of the major accomplishments of the Sunshine Policy has been considered to be the Mt. Gumgang tourism development (Choi, 1999; Hong, 2005a; Sims, 2000), which has been compared to the ostpolitik of West Germany (Kindermann, 2000). The idea for the policy comes from an old fable in which the wind (power) and sun (cooperation) compete to make a man take off his jacket. The cold blowing wind only makes the man bundle up tighter while the warm sunshine compels him to take off his jacket of his own volition (Toffler, 1998). Since South Korea's new President, Moo Hyun Roh, is continuing to pursue the Sunshine Policy, it is thought that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development will continue to play an important role in promoting peaceful circumstances on the Korean Peninsula.",

First, there has been a lack of theoretical underpinning from other fields such as political science to support the role of tourism in the contribution to peace (Richter, 1983). Second, the role of tourism in the contribution to peace needs to be empirically analyzed more rigorously (Litvin, 1998). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula by employing the theory of neofunctionalism. Despite the importance of the issue of tourism and peace, no previous studies have attempted to empirically test the hypothesis while also being grounded in appropriate theory. To accomplish this goal, the Mountain Gumgang Peace Index was created and the spill-over effects investigated. It is also hoped that this study will contribute to the literature of tourism by re-examining whether neofunctionalism, which has been developed to describe western integration, is theoretically appropriate to describe the conditions on the Korean Peninsula.",

Realism is more pessimistic and stresses insecurity, force, and survival as the natural relations between states while liberalism is more optimistic and stresses economic interdependence through the development of ties and contracts (Nye, 1993). Therefore, the potential for peace among states is a liberal ideal. The tourism industry has been seen as playing an integral role in the world's quest for peace. Accordingly, tourism scholars have made efforts to maximize the role of tourism in world peace. The \u201cInternational Tourism Passport to Peace\u201d and \u201cPeace through Tourism\u201d were organized, in 1987 and 1990, respectively. The first global conference, \u201cTourism: A Vital Force for Peace\u201d was organized in 1988 (Khamouna & Zeiger, 1995). Furthermore, tourism has repeatedly been recognized as a social force that can promote international understanding, cooperation, and global fraternity in promoting world peace (Caneday, 1991; Holland, 1991; Knopf, 1991).",

The relationship of the USA and the People's Republic of China is a good example of the contribution of tourism to world peace. D\u2019Amore (1988) suggested that the key to a changed political relationship between the USA and the People's Republic of China was opening travel in various forms such as conferences, sports, twinning of cites, and trade. Zhuang (1993) indicated that travel to visit families on the mainland marked the beginning of people-to-people contact between the two sides (China and Taiwan) after 38 years of separation and hostility. Furthermore, Butler and Mao (1996), who outlined the six evolutionary processes of travel patterns, suggested that as the frequency of travel increases between countries in dispute such as Korea, conditions are likely to be more conducive to peace. Finally, Anson (1999) explored the role of tourism using the example of the contested heritage of Northern Ireland and its potential contribution to community peace building as the province emerges from 30 years of conflict.",

Since the Korean Peninsula was divided, South Korea has gradually attempted to reunify the Korean Peninsula by implementing various policies, as shown in Table 1\n. From the era of President Syng Man Rhee (1948\u201360) to Prime Minister Myon Chang (1960\u201361) South Korea was hostile toward North Korea. However, with the prevailing mood of d\u00e9tente between East and West, South Korea started a conciliatory policy toward North Korea from the administration of President Cheong Hee Park (1962\u201381). This atmosphere continued to the period of President Doo Hwan Chun (1982\u201387). President Tae Woo Rho (1988\u201392) then pursued one nation reunification and established momentum for Korea reunification. Representatives of both Koreas addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time on October 18 and 20, 1988, respectively, publicly articulating their conciliatory policies toward each other. President Young Sam Kim (1993\u201397) continued a similar policy. However, the history of political negotiations seeking the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas has demonstrated that the political efforts of previous governments have not lead to substantive progress toward reunification.",

For example, a comprehensive set of tourism-oriented proposals was made in 1982. Joint management of homeland visits by overseas Koreans permitting them free travel to Korea and an exchange of goodwill visits are examples that were included in the proposals. However, the proposals were rejected by North Korea except for permission for a select number of people to travel to the other side, which was provided by the two Koreas in 1985. However, most of the tourism initiatives of the early 1990s were proposals or plans that were never implemented. In sum, the earlier contacts between the two regimes were arrangements of political expediency and there were no serious commitments to move toward permanent reconciliation.

The other, with which we are mainly concerned here, is regional and applies to the development of integration between two or more separate countries. Functionalism is one of the approaches of integration theory developed from the political perspective of liberalism (Hong, 2005a). Functionalists insist that the economic interdependence that liberalism stresses can play an important role in maintaining peaceful circumstances in global society. Furthermore, they insist that economic interdependence should be separated from political relations. Therefore, functionalist theory has viewed depoliticization and a technical treatment of issues as the most promising route to ultimate political integration. The chief exponent of functionalism, Mitrany (1943), suggests that peaceful change comes not through a shift of national boundaries (politics) but by means of technical cooperation organized around basic functional needs such as transportation, health, cultural activities, and trade taken across them.",

Although there have been serious incidents such as submarine infiltration, suspicion of nuclear development, experimental launching of missiles, and invasion of territorial waters by North Korea, the Sunshine Policy was maintained.

In exchange for opening parts of the mountain regions to tours from 1998, it had to pay 12 million dollars US per month regardless of the number of tourists. In fact, the deal was not economically feasible and was favorable to North Korea. Although Hyundai Asan Corporation negotiated to reduce the fee down to 100 US dollars per visitor in 2001, it was still not economically feasible.

Gumgang tourism development has had two different sides: a method of reducing political tension or inadvertently becoming a vehicle for inhibiting peace if funds paid to North Korea through the Mt. Gumgang tourism development are used to purchase arms to threaten South Korea. Recently, Kim and Prideaux (2006) investigated South Korean's perceptions of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development and indicated that the respondents perceived that \u201cthere is a role for tourism in developing peaceful relations between hostile nations\u201d (Kim & Prideaux, 2006, p. 135).

Therefore, the neofunctionalist model may not be entirely appropriate on the Korean Peninsula since it was designed to describe more democratic, pluralistic, and industrial settings. In addition, Haas (1964) did not specifically mention the Korean Peninsula for the question of the applicability of neofunctionalism. However, it is important to state that the South Korean government has explicitly applied a neofunctionalist perspective and this will continue to be applied on the Korean Peninsula in pursuing the Mt. Gumgang tourism development (Choi, 1999; Hong, 2005a; Inter-Korean relations, 2003; Sims, 2000).

The advantage of using event data is that by isolating specific instances of events, one can examine phenomenon more closely (Fatehi & Gupta, 1992). Consequently, information on certain patterns of evolution can be gathered through these event data. To achieve this analysis, event data in the context of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development were gathered from Yonhap News, a daily newspaper in South Korea. Yonhap News is the primary source of interaction between North and South Korea since Chosun Central Communications in North Korea agreed to release information on North Korea to Yonhap News Service. For a three-month period under study Lee (2003) found that most daily domestic and major international newspapers referred to information from Yonhap News regarding interaction between North and South Korea. He concluded that Yonhap News was the major information source for interaction between North and South Korea. Table 5\nshows the number of events in relation to the Mt. Gumgang tourism development.

In fact, the detention in June 1999, of a South Korean tourist who was charged with spying after she made critical remarks about North Korea's Stalinist political system, led to a halt of the tours for one and half months. Consequently, conflictive events between North and South Korea followed the detention. For example, North Korea refused to discuss the security issue of tourists visiting Mt. Gumgang and did not allow a South Korean baseball team to visit Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. This is similar to the case of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. The positive political development attributed to increased travel exchanges between the two peoples suffered a severe setback in 1994 when 24 Taiwanese tourists were murdered at Qian Dao Lake in the People's Republic of China resulting in renewed political tension between the two governments (Yu, 1997).",

Daily MGPI was calculated by the sum of the weighted values of the dimensions corresponding to events, divided by number of events. Consequently, the monthly MGPI was the averages of the daily MGPI, and yearly MGPI was the average of the monthly MGPI. There have been no significant events that can be classified as a higher degree of cooperativeness and intensity (i.e., military aid or strategic alliance) in the context of the Mt.

South Korea strategically provided North Korea with economic aid through the Mt. Gumgang tourism development and the Mt. Gumgang tourism development could be used effectively as a useful conduit for the reunion of dispersed families, investment guarantees and the prevention of double taxation through the economic cooperation council. In addition, a railroad and highway passing through the demilitarized zone for meetings of high-ranking military officers was constructed in 2000. Therefore, it can be argued that relatively less intensive adoption of a comprehensive approach may have resulted in a lower MGPI and a lack of spill-over effects since a comprehensive approach requires that political, diplomatic, security, and trade negotiations occur simultaneously.",

In addition, it was found that there has been an insufficient pattern of spill-over effects through the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. However, the process of economic integration did not lead to political developments. Furthermore, lack of collaborative activity and activity from North Korea indicates that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development was not reinforced with deep commitment. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula is valid although the contribution is not significant.",

However, the government of South Korea has started to be officially involved in the Mt. Gumgang tourism development since the government considers it part of a peace business that needs help from the official body to maintain peace in the Korean Peninsula (Cho, 2004). This fact indicates that it is possible to use tourism as a vehicle to lay the groundwork for a shift from inter-Korean confrontation for reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. However, to attain this goal, it is suggested that both North and South Korea, on the basis of mutual interests, adapt integrative lessons learned in one context to new situations through the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. In this way, cooperation steadily increases and spill-over effects can be realized, resulting in the promotion of peace on the Korean Peninsula. However, the paradigm of neofunctionalism has not been fully applicable in the case of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development since a less intensive comprehensive approach was adopted and major political issues between North and South Korea are likely to be affected by surrounding countries.",

Based on the findings of this study, it may be argued that tourism can be considered as a potential activity for influencing political interactions ultimately resulting in a peaceful atmosphere in these countries. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate whether tourism has the ability to reduce tension and in turn influence political relations in these countries in the context of the neofunctionalist model.",

Gumgang tourism development, started in 1998 may bias the conclusions of this study. In addition, a more sophisticated device needs to be developed to collect data. Although Yonhap News is the best data source available, a single source has certain limitations. For example, confidential reports from internal sources such as Hyundai Asan Corporation that may have useful information were not considered in this study. Furthermore, it should be noted that the relationship diagnosis of event consequences needs to be used with caution. It is difficult to clearly determine if there is a cause and effect relationship between the specific events of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development and if they influenced consequent unrelated events. For example, it is not certain that the revival of the Seoul-Pyongyang soccer game and the co-hosting of the Asian Games in 2014 were attributable to certain actions of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. The relationship uncertainty of event consequences may also bias the conclusions of this study since this study considered only objective events that were definitely caused by the specific events of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development.",
