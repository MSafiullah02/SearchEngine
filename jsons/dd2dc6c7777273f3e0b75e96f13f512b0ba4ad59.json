Along with this outbreak is a parallel pandemic of fear, anxiety, and depression. The virus does not only affect physical health but also emotional well-being of all mankind, bringing substantial psychosocial impact on every member of the society. During this unprecedented outbreak, necessary measures had been taken to contain the virus transmission by mass indoor quarantine and social distancing. In Malaysia, movement control order has been implemented throughout the country as a containment measure battling this pandemic (Tang, 2020) .",

There was also an imbalance of the self-versus other mentalizing domain when she was concerned about selfinternal state and feared of \"disappearing\", to the extent of attempting to control others by forcing them to maintain conversation with her. In addition, she was overly sensitive to external signs of intimacy such as the frequency of contacts made by her friends and silence from the others.

It takes me sometime to figure out why I'm feeling so. It is due to the fact that I feel neglected and lonely, not by my family because they are constantly around me, but by my friends. T: Can you share with me more about this feeling of being neglected? A: It's because my friends don't message me. And I really miss those times of being able to talk to them in person. I know people keep telling me that this lockdown is affecting everyone, and it makes sense why this would happen. But in my opinion, it shouldn't be an excuse for you not to reach out to somebody. We can still call. You can still message me. I don't need a text every day, but if you're going to be like going for weeks without contacting me, then I will be very concerned of what's stopping you. Unless you've explained to me that you are not used to this kind of communication, otherwise, I'm not going to be able to understand why you're unable to just strike up a conversation with me. T: Alright, when u mentioned that u feel your friends have abandoned you, did you try to reach out to them? A: Yea, I do. I have been reaching out to them more often than I will normally do because obviously we can't see each other. I tried to strike up a conversation with them. Again, I had to dig deep for topics in order for them to come up with something to reply on. T: Has this been the case ever since the lockdown started?A: Actually this has always been the case even before these. I cannot sit quietly with someone because I personally will feel extremely uncomfortable and get very self-conscious at that moment. So, I will probably try to find ways to keep the conversation going on and not letting it die down. With this lockdown, it has become more intense. It is like getting worst essentially.",
