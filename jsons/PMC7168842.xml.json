            "text": "Gastrointestinal (GI) parasites are estimated to infect more than two billion people throughout the world [1]. Both soil-transmitted helminths (STH) (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworms, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura) and protozoans (Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica) are prevalent in resource-limited areas [2, 3]. Symptoms include chronic diarrhea, severe anemia, and can lead to intestinal obstruction. Economically disadvantaged children have recurrent infections and malnutrition that may lead to growth and cognitive delays [4]. These children have more difficulties in school and, subsequently, in the job market [4]. The cycle continues when they remain in poverty and have their children [4]. The link between intestinal helminths and malnutrition leading to growth stunting and anemia has been found by others [5\u201312], and a Global Burden of Disease Study points to evidence that hookworm is a leading cause of anemia in resource-poor settings [13]. Valuable information from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) and studies related to returning travelers also reveals an unexpected global health impact caused by some protozoans, possibly including giardiasis [14, 15]. The Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) study found an association with subclinical, non-diarrheal giardiasis and decreases in growth of children [16]. There are few studies attributing gut microbiome changes to giardiasis [17\u201319] and no published studies showing the impact on the human intestinal microbiome using multi-parallel real-time quantitative (qPCR) to detect the presence of Giardia and quantitating the burden of infection [20]. To date, most studies examining intestinal parasitism have not been able to study intestinal worms and protozoans simultaneously and to successfully dissect the relative contribution of each of the significant intestinal helminth or protozoan pathogens to specific diseases. The current state of diagnosing gastrointestinal parasites in resource-limited areas uses the subjective method of microscopy. Depending on the parasite, single stool microscopy exam sensitivity ranges from 50\u201380% [21]. As a result, large numbers of infected children are not being diagnosed correctly and treated.",

Giardia duodenalis is known to cause malabsorption, steatorrhea, and diarrhea [31], with preliminary studies finding improvements in vitamin B12 serum levels after treatment for giardiasis [32, 33]. Vitamin B12 is a crucial microbiota-derived co-enzyme for humans who cannot produce it [34\u201336]. As vitamin B12 production is unique to specific intestinal bacteria, alterations in intestinal microbiota could diminish vitamin B12 availability for human use [37]. Advances in next-generation DNA sequencing allow for precise taxonomic comparisons between intestinal microbiotas and can simultaneously be used to scan the intestinal microbiota meta-genome for the presence of functional genes necessary for the specific functions, like cobalamin synthesis. In this pilot study, parasite qPCR and next-generation DNA sequencing was used to explore whether quantitative burden of specific parasites (Giardia duodenalis and soil-transmitted helminths) influence the composition of intestinal microbial communities. Using vitamin B12 as a representative bacteria-generated nutrient, we analyzed bacterial metagenomes as a surrogate for changes in intestinal bacteria functions associated with intestinal parasitic infections. This was a preliminary study using a population with high prevalence of intestinal parasites. It is meant as an introductory for the future direction of our research.",

This descriptive study is a preliminary evidence for future studies looking at the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway.
