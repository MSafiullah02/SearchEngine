            "text": "In many viruses, programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121RF) is a common recoding mechanism that regulates the relative expression of proteins that are encoded in two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) during translation.1 Programmed \u22121RF has been shown in most retroviruses, corona viruses, yeast, and plant virus, and even in bacteria.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 The ORF encoding the major viral structural protein is located upstream of the \u22121 frameshift site, whereas ORFs encoding the enzymatic proteins are located downstream of \u22121 frameshift site. The major enzymatic proteins are only translated as a result of an \u22121RF, which occurs with an efficiency of 1\u201330%, depending on the virus. This difference in efficiency suggests that the ratio of structural proteins to enzymatic proteins varies among viruses. If the efficiency of \u22121RF in viruses is changed, it will dramatically change the ratio of related gene products and disrupt viral assembly.9, 10 Since maintaining an accurate ratio is important for virus survival, altering the \u22121RF efficiency interferes with the virus life cycle by eliminating or reducing viral production. Therefore, \u22121RF should be an excellent target for the development of antiviral agents. It has been already reported that the antibiotics, such as anisomycin, sparsomycin, and preussin, inhibit \u22121RF and viral reproduction.11\n",

The slippery site consists of a heptamer sequence X XXY YYZ, where X can be any three identical nucleotides, Y is either A or U, and Z is A, U, or C; the spacer sequence separates codons in the initial (zero) frame. Mutagenesis studies showed that the spacer is necessary for efficient \u22121RF. The ribosomal changes in reading frame occur in the slippery site during a ribosomal pause.12, 13, 14 The third element is usually a pseudoknot located five or six nucleotides (spacer) downstream from the slippery site. The pseudoknot induces the frameshifting by hindering the approaching ribosome and contributes to the probability of a reading-frame shift into the \u22121 frame.15, 16, 17, 18 The function of the pseudoknot in the \u22121RF was first identified using a signal derived from the avian corona virus infectious bronchitis, showing that the stability of the pseudoknot is critical for the efficiency of \u22121RF.",

The movement of the tRNA through the ribosome is resisted during translocation, because the wound pseudoknot is too large to enter the mRNA tunnel. As a result, the linker region between the A-site codon and the mRNA pseudoknot is stretched, causing tension in the linker mRNA. Because of this developed tension, mRNA strand moves one base in a (+) sense (3\u2032 direction). Therefore, the ribosome attempts to translocate the anticodon into the accurate P-site by the codon\u2013anticodon reaction that places strain on the P-site tRNA, causing a bent conformation. As a result, the P-site tRNA codon\u2013anticodon interaction is broken over the slippery site, causing relaxation of the tRNA in a (\u2212) sense direction (5\u2032 direction). The tRNA can reassociate with the mRNA to generate the protein XXX YYY Z instead of X XXY YYZ in the \u22121 frame as the pseudoknot is denatured and elongation continues in the new reading frame.22\n",

The acceptor atom is the carbonyl oxygen atom of the ureido ring of biotin, which forms a hydrogen bond with G6, and the acceptor site is the ribose O4\u2032 atom of U7. About 80,000 compounds from chemical database31 were sent to a flexible Unity search. After the first filtering using Unity, 514 compounds were selected from the chemical database. In the second step, these 514 compounds were docked into the active site of the biotin binding site of the biotin-pseudoknot using FlexX, and ranked by FlexX scoring function.30 The active site was defined as all residues within 6.5 \u00c5 of the reference ligand, biotin, in the biotin-pseudoknot. The active site included 9 residues (G6, U7, A16, C17, G18, A24, A25, A26, G27, and Mg 6). The nucleic acid residues, U7 and A26, are key residues that interact with biotin.26 Eighty-six compounds that were highly-ranked in the FlexX output as occupying the biotin-binding pocket were selected for a final intensive docking analysis. The final docking analysis was performed using FlexX combined with the consensus scoring function, CScore.30 In our score analysis, any docked pose of the structures with a CScore greater than 4 was visually inspected for further consideration, because several conformers had bad position in the active site. Optimal score was calculated as the ratio of the number of conformers bound properly in the active site to the total number of conformers with CScores above 4. Among the 86 candidates, compounds with a CScore below 3 were consistently considered poor and so were dropped from consideration. After final filtering with FlexX, together with the CScore values, 58 compounds were selected to examine their effect on \u22121 frameshifting efficiency in biological assays.",

To examine the effect of these 58 compounds on \u22121RF, in vitro transcription/translation (TNT\u00ae)-coupled assays were conducted in rabbit reticulocytes using the template construct shown in Figure 2\nA. If a \u22121RF occurs at the slippery sequence, the termination codon of the Renilla luciferase gene (rluc) is not read and translation proceeds through the firefly luciferase gene (fluc), resulting in the production of an rluc\u2013fluc fusion protein. The \u22121 frameshifting efficiencies in the presence of selected compounds were measured both by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) and dual luciferase assays. First, we determined \u22121 frameshifting efficiencies by SDS\u2013PAGE; the results are shown in Figure 2B. The rluc\u2013fluc fusion product yields a 100-kDa protein containing 22 methionine residues, whereas the non-frameshifting rluc protein product is 40 kDa with 9 methionines. Therefore, frameshifting efficiencies (%) were calculated using the formula (I[RF]/22)/[(I[RF]/22)+(I[NRF]/9)], where I[RF] is the signal intensity of the frameshifting product (RF) and I[NRF] is the signal intensity of the non-frameshifting product. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was considered as a control because all test compounds were dissolved in DMSO. The frameshifting (100 kDa) and non-frameshifting (40 kDa) proteins are marked with arrows in Figure 2B. The fold change in \u22121RF was determined by calculating the ratio of \u22121 frameshifting efficiency in the presence of compounds versus that in the absence of compounds. Six compounds (e7, h5, b5, e4, h4, and h2) shown in Figure 3\nA, increased \u22121RF, and h4 noticeably increased \u22121 frameshifting efficiency up to 13.67% (Fig. 2B, lane 7), approximately 19-fold greater than the 0.71% efficiency observed in control (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Other compounds (e7, h5, b5, e4, and h2) afforded 2- to 15-fold increase in \u22121 frameshifting efficiency.",

The key pharmacophoric elements include two hydrophobic features derived from six hit compounds that increase the \u22121 frameshifting. Two hydrogen bond acceptors and one donor features are common to all the molecules aligned including the template biotin.

The hit compound h4 (\u221223.4 kcal/mol) was ranked higher than biotin (\u221219.1 kcal/mol) in the FlexX binding energy score output. Compound h4 is bound at the interface between the two stems (stem1 and stem2) and interacts with the last nucleotide of stem 1 (U7) by forming multiple hydrogen bonds. This docking mode is similar to the binding pose of biotin in the X-ray structure (Fig. 1B). As shown in Figure 1C, the difluoro-phenyl ureidyl group of h4 fits into the binding pocket for the ureido ring of biotin. Ureidyl NH groups of h4 form hydrogen bonds with O4\u2032 and 2-carbonyl oxygen of uracil ring of U7, respectively, and NH of the sulfonamido group forms a hydrogen bond with ribose O2\u2032 atom of A16 in stem 1. Compound h4 interacts with U7, one of the critical residues for interaction with biotin in the X-ray structure. In addition, h4 interacts with more residues in the RNA pseudoknot than biotin does, which may increase the stability of the biotin-pseudoknot. As a result, the pseudoknot complexed with h4 may increase the time that the ribosome pauses on the slippery site, resulting in an increase of \u22121RF. In studies of peptidyl transferase inhibitors, longer stalled time of the ribosome on the slippery site strongly increased the \u22121 frameshifting efficiencies.35\n",

We used the crystal structure of the biotin-pseudoknot (PDB id: 1F27) obtained from Protein Data Bank. We extracted biotin from 1F27 to use as the reference ligand. A commercially-available chemical database31 was used in Unity 2D and 3D search for structures that interact similarly to biotin. The pharmacophore query for Unity search consisted of a hydrogen bond acceptor atom and a hydrogen bond acceptor site. The acceptor atom is the ureido carbonyl oxygen atom of biotin, which forms a hydrogen bond with exocyclic 2NH2 of G6. The acceptor site is the ribose O4\u2032 atom of U7 residue, one of the key residues in the biotin-binding pocket. All selected compounds were energy-minimized with the standard Tripos force field, after Gasteiger\u2013H\u0171ckel charges were assigned for the ligand atoms. The minimization was run until the energy converged to a maximum derivative of 0.001 kcal mol\u22121\u00b7\u00c5\u22121.",
