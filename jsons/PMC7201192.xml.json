The pandemic has exposed the limits of\nmarket-based economic and health systems but also threatens to engulf even the most\negalitarian societies. And in times of crisis, it appears that many of us seek out\ncharismatic leaders or authoritarians who can, allegedly, defeat the virus just by\nremaining positive or simply by denying the evidence, confusing as that is. If\nleadership is partly about making people face up to unfortunate truths \u2013 and it\nsurely is \u2013 then we need leadership that embodies this, at the same time as we\nmanage the research and resources to keep the systems going. Of course, we also need\ncommanders when and where necessary, but all of these decision-modes need to be\ncontextualised and deployed carefully. And we need to be especially wary of\ncommanders who seek to persuade us that \u2018the situation\u2019 \u2013 which they cannot reveal\nfor fear of frightening us further \u2013 is so dire that they need to continue the state\nof emergency, \u2018for our own safety.\u2019 Otherwise, as Winston Smith persuades himself at\nthe end of 1984, he was previously an enemy of the people but now\nhe does, after all, \u2018love Big Brother.\u2019",
