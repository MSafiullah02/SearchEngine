            "text": "Flaviviruses are important human pathogens causing a variety of diseases ranging from mild febrile illness to severe encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever. Among them, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a neuropathogenic virus commonly infecting children and is associated with acute encephalitis [1]. The disease burden of Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an increasing public health problem with an average of 50 000 cases per year in Asia [2], [3]. Despite this, the prospects for therapy of flavivirus infections are not encouraging, which has led to the unavailability of a specific and efficient antiviral agent against JEV [4]. This has rekindled the search for a drug that can inhibit JEV replication.",

JEV infection generates a rapid inflammatory response following entry into the host, and elevated levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) have been correlated with poor outcome in JE patients [14]. The pathophysiology of central nervous system inflammation in JEV may be attributed to TNF\u03b1, which ranges from promoting viral replication to evasion of host defences [15]. These observations raise the possibility that a compound capable of blocking TNF\u03b1 could reduce the severity of JEV infection. Pentoxifylline is a known inhibitor of TNF\u03b1 production [16]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that pentoxifylline exhibits antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and HIV [7], [17].

The results of the confirmatory plaque reduction assay suggested that pentoxifylline and ribavirin were able to inhibit JEV replication in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). There was a significant reduction in JEV plaques by pentoxifylline at a concentration well below the CC50, with an IC50 of 50.3 \u03bcg/mL (0.00018 \u03bcM), whilst the IC50 of ribavirin was 3.9 \u03bcg/mL (0.000016 \u03bcM).

In the absence of such information, we asked two crucial questions pertaining to the antiviral activity of pentoxifylline. (i) What is the probable stage at which pentoxifylline inhibits virus replication? And (ii) how late can addition of pentoxifylline to infected cells be delayed to achieve complete inhibition of virus replication? To answer these questions, we used an experimental approach similar to that described by Baginiski et al. [18]. Pentoxifylline was added at 2-h intervals post infection until the completion of one replicative cycle of JEV. It appeared that pentoxifylline was able to inhibit JEV replication very late in the replication cycle. This assumption is based on several findings obtained in this study: (i) the presence of cell-bound antigen detected by IFA at all time points (Fig. 3A) suggests that protein translation is unaffected by the drug; (ii) the presence of a 50 kDa in vitro translation product (Fig. 4) obtained at both 4 h and 10 h post infection further affirmed that translation of viral proteins was unaffected by the drug; and (iii) neither infectious virus nor soluble viral antigen could be detected (Fig. 3B) in the supernatant of drug-treated cells until 14-h post infection. Taken together, these three observations suggest that pentoxifylline was indeed able to inhibit JEV replication at a stage beyond viral translation, probably interfering with assembly and/or release of the virion. Had pentoxifylline interfered with early or late protein translation, detection of JEV antigen by IFA in drug-treated cells would not have been possible (Fig. 3A).",

Indeed, this drug at concentrations of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight was able to protect mice completely against a lethal challenge (50\u00d7 LD50) of JEV. Although viral RNA was demonstrated in the brains of all drug-treated mice that survived JEV infection, there were no classical signs of illness observed in any of the mice. This indicates that the virus crossed the BBB following i.p. injection but failed to replicate in the presence of the compounds since there was no viral antigen demonstrable in the brain smears of drug-treated mice. To ascertain that the viral RNA detected in the brain was not due to persistence of infection, virus isolation was carried out using a C6/36 monolayer. It was observed that all the mice that survived the infection failed to demonstrate replicating virus. This indicates the lack of infectious virus in the brains of mice that survived treatment with pentoxifylline. Notwithstanding these observations, it must be emphasised that pentoxifylline is a potent inhibitor of TNF [16]. Recently, it has been reported that JEV induces apoptosis in cell lines via the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway [19]. The underlying mechanism of neuronal apoptosis in JEV has been attributed to the role of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily [20]. Therefore, it is also possible that apart from exhibiting anti-JEV activity, pentoxifylline could have also modulated the TNF responses and protected mice against lethal challenge. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the immunomodulatory role of pentoxifylline in JEV infection.",
