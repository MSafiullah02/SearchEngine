The logistic curve model was used with Bayesian regression for predictive analytics of the coronavirus spread. The impact of COVID-19 was studied using regression approach and compared to other crises influence. In practical analytics, it is important to find the maximum of coronavirus cases per day, this point means the estimated half time of coronavirus spread in the region under investigation. The obtained results show that different crises with different reasons have different impact on the same stocks. It is important to analyze their impact separately. Bayesian inference makes it possible to analyze the uncertainty of crisis impacts.",

For the predictive analytics of COVID-19 spread, we used a logistic curve model. Such model is very popular nowadays. To estimate model parameters, we used Bayesian regression [7, 8, 9] . This approach allows us to receive a posterior distribution of model parameters using conditional likelihood and prior distribution. In the Bayesian inference, we can use informative prior distributions which can be set up by an expert. So, the result can be considered as a compromise between historical data and expert opinion. It is important in the cases when we have a small number of historical data. Probabilistic approach makes it possible to receive the probability density function for the target variable. Logistic curve model with Bayesian regression approach can be written as follows:",

For solving Bayesian models, numerical Monte-Carlo methods are used. Gibbs and Hamiltonian sampling are the popular methods of finding posterior distributions for the parameters of probabilistic mode [7, 8, 9] . Bayesian inference makes it possible to obtain probability density functions for model parameters and estimate the uncertainty that is important in risk assessment analytics. In Bayesian regression approach, we can take into account expert opinions via information prior distribution.

We are going to consider the impact of coronavirus crisis on stocks and compare it to the crisis of 2008 and market downturn of 2018. For this, we can use the regression approach using OLS regression and Bayesian regression. Bayesian inference makes it possible to obtain probability density functions for coefficients of the factors under investigation and estimate the uncertainty that is important in the risk assessment analytics. In Bayesian regression approach, we can analyze extreme target variable values using non gaussian distributions with fat tails. We took the following time periods Figure 9 shows the time series for S&P500 composite index: As a target variable, we consider the daily price return. Knowing the daily price return, changes in crises periods, one can estimate the ability of investors to understand trends and recalculate portfolios. These results were received using Bayesian inference. For Bayesian inference calculations, we used Python pystan package for Stan platform for statistical modeling [9] . Figure 10 shows the box plots of impact weights of each crisis on S&P500 composite index. The wider box for coronavirus weight can be caused by shorter time period of investigation comparing with other crises and consequently larger uncertainty. For our investigations, we took a random set of tickers from S&P list. Figure 11 shows top negative price returns in coronavirus crises. Figure 12 shows the tickers with positive price return in coronavirus crisis. Figure 13 shows the weights for different crises for arbitrarily chosen stocks. We calculated the distributions for crises weights using Bayesian inference. Figure 14 shows the box plots for crisis weights for different stocks. ",

The uncertainty of coronavirus crisis is larger comparing to other crises that can be caused by shorter analysis time.
