Respiratory viruses are the most common cause of respiratory infections in children [2]. Advances in molecular methods including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have led to increased sensitivity for viral detection and the identification of several new viruses and viral species. However, advanced diagnostics are largely limited to the developed world and studies investigating a comprehensive range of pathogens are lacking in African countries. The majority of respiratory viral aetiological studies in Africa have utilized traditional cell culture and serological methods, and data for viruses other than respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are scarce. Studies of ALRI in African children published as recently as 2013 did not screen for common respiratory viruses such as human rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus and bocavirus [3].",

The majority of these studies in hospitalized children found that RV-C was the most prevalent RV species and was often associated with wheezing, asthma and ALRI [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Only three studies have investigated the prevalence of RV species in African children [13], [14], [15], one of which was in South African children with acute wheezing illness.

Evidence suggests that HIV infection plays an important role in the frequency and outcome of ALRI [16]. Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children [17]. Few studies have investigated the viral aetiology of ALRI in HIV-infected children. A recent study from South Africa reported that a respiratory virus was identified in the majority of both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children, with RV being the most frequently identified [18]. No studies have investigated RV species in HIV-infected children.

Pneumonia was diagnosed in children with respiratory distress and either chest X-ray changes (e.g. consolidation or effusion) or auscultatory findings (e.g. crepitations or bronchial breathing) while bronchiolitis was diagnosed in children with respiratory distress and at least one of the following; wheeze, chest X-ray changes (e.g. hyperinflation) or Hoover\u2019s sign (inward movement of the lower rib cage during inspiration). Age-matched children presenting to the same hospitals with a non-respiratory illness or injury over the same period were enrolled as controls. Control children were hospitalized for non-respiratory illnesses including epilepsy, febrile convulsions, gastroenteritis, elective cardiac surgery, cardiac catheterization and pre-existing neurological problems.

Viral RNA was extracted from a 240 \u03bcl volume of NPAs using the QIAGEN QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Spin protocol), reverse transcribed to cDNA, and used for the PCR amplification of a 260-bp variable sequence in the 5\u2032 non-coding region of the RV genome using in-house designed primers. The DNA sequence of the PCR products was determined by the Australian Genome Research Facility. Genotypes were assigned based on comparisons of the 5\u2032 non-coding region sequences with those of 101 classical serotypes as well as 52 newly identified genotypes using ClustalX software (Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland). Representative samples of each genotype have previously been sequenced at the VP4-VP2 coding region to confirm the species assignment [21], [22].",

One explanation is increased protection by maternal antibodies during the first 6 months of life which decreases in the following year as infants begin to produce more of their own antibodies which reach protective levels after 1\u20132 years of age. Our findings confirm that age is an important risk factor for viral respiratory infection.",

Secondly, the use of hospital controls rather than community controls may contribute to the high viral identification rate among controls. Thirdly, although nasopharyngeal identification of viruses has been associated with lower respiratory tract infections, it also occurs among asymptomatic individuals and hence, may not be entirely representative of the aetiological agents of the lower airway. Since we cannot differentiate asymptomatic from symptomatic infection, a virus-positive NPA suggests, but does not prove causation. Studies in larger cohorts including HIV-infected children are needed to better understand the role of respiratory viruses in ALRI and HIV. Nonetheless, this study has contributed to our understanding of the epidemiology and aetiology of respiratory viruses and interactions with HIV in children hospitalized with ALRI in South Africa.",
