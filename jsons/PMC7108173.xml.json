The median time to seroconversion in SARS patients, however, is 17\u201320 days after the onset of symptoms (4); therefore, rapid diagnosis by antibody detection is not possible. ELISA-based antigen detection tests are well known to offer high specificity and reproducibility, but they lack sensitivity (5). As for the direct detection of viruses, culturing of the virus from clinical specimens is dangerous and insensitive; the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription-PCR is expensive and labor-intensive and relies on the availability of expertise, and false-positive results may result from contamination. In addition, although SARS-CoV can be detected in nasopharyngeal specimens, sputum, and stool, peak viral shedding from these sites, and therefore the most optimal time for testing, occurs around 10 days after illness onset and then decreases (4)(6).",

(7) and Yip et al.(8) present evidence that a new proteomics technology, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF), may provide a solution to these problems. SELDI-TOF is a proteomic technology involved in quantitative analysis of protein mixtures. This technique uses trapping surfaces that allow differential capture of proteins based on the intrinsic properties of the proteins themselves. It can yield comprehensive profiles of peptides and proteins in biological fluids without the need to first carry out protein separations. Microliter quantities of samples are applied to the surface of a protein-binding plate with physical properties that bind a class of proteins. The bound proteins are laser desorbed and ionized for mass spectral analysis. Masses of proteins ranging from small peptides of <1000 Da up to proteins of >300 kDa are calculated based on time of flight. As mixtures of proteins are analyzed within different samples, a unique sample fingerprint or signature will result for each sample tested. In the case of SARS and other infections, these fingerprints reflect proteins specific to the infectious agent itself, as well as proteins related to the host\u2019s response to that infectious agent.",

Additional important findings were that the tests were positive early in the course of disease. All seven SARS patients tested within 24 h of onset of fever were positive, and patients could be grouped according to the severity of their disease. The ability to rapidly diagnose patients could allow for the early implementation of appropriate infection control measures and treatment. Being able to predict the clinical course of illness could also allow optimal tailoring of therapy, with more potent but toxic agents being reserved for those with more severe disease.",

(7) determined the sensitivity and specificity of their assay by comparing its use in SARS patients with that in control patients. The controls included healthy persons as well as persons with other infections. Although it was important to use healthy patients as controls during the initial validation of these assays, from a diagnostic perspective including these types of controls in the calculations of sensitivity and specificity of an assay may artificially enhance the apparent sensitivity and specificity of the assay. From an infectious diseases perspective, one is not trying to separate healthy patients from infected ill patients, but rather one is trying to identify the cause of symptoms in patients presenting with similar symptoms to aid in the selection of the most appropriate therapy for a specific organism.",

(8), serum amyloid A concentrations remained increased in one patient because of a superimposed bacterial infection, suggesting that a severe bacterial infection could give the same increase in amyloid A as SARS.",

It would be of interest to determine whether SELDI-TOF reveals profiles specific or prognostic for these other, more common infectious diseases.

SELDI-TOF and the field of proteomics clearly meet the expectations of this newly emerged concept (9). Not only can SELDI-TOF aid in the diagnosis of infections caused by known agents, it also has the potential to aid in the diagnosis of newly emerging infectious diseases before the etiologic agent is known. In addition, it can offer insight into prognosis, provide rapid real-time data regarding response to treatment, and help identify targets useful for the development of specific diagnostic tests and specific therapeutics. Clearly, SELDI-TOF and the field of proteomics are emerging technologies that have the potential to positively impact the field of infectious diseases.
