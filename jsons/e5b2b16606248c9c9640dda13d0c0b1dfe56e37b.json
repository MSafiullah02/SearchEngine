They belong to roughly 200 heart transplant survivors in the province. One had a mild disease course, while the other was inpatient, requiring a protracted hospitalization time due to severe disease, but both recovered. The authors pointed out that the symptoms at onset in these two cases were not dissimilar to those of non-immunosuppressed cases. The first patient had fever and aspecific findings at CT scan, with recovery after few days and showing the same laboratory findings as non-immunosuppressed patients. The second one had immunosuppressive therapy discontinued and was treated with high dose corticosteroids and immunoglobulins. He had a favorable outcome, being discharged without graft loss. The authors concluded that immunosuppression could have possibly decreased the expression of infection, even though transplant patients are all the same exposed to infection because of the elevated efficiency in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (4). D'Antiga reported his experience at one of the most important pediatric hepatology and liver transplantation centers in Italy, in one of the current -red zones\u2016 of the outbreak. In a pool of at least 200 transplant patients, of which ten children being inpatients, three tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, without clinical pulmonary disease and thus showing a favorable outcome.

Guan et al. described 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, of which 9 were children aged between 0 and 14. Only one of the children was admitted to ICU and all recovered.

Also individuals on immunosuppressive treatment risk complications of influenza infection (23) (24) . However, this does not seem to be true for Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) infections.

Several protocols and recommendations have been developed in single centers and at national and international level (30)(31) often recommending to change or interrupt ongoing treatment in order to reduce immunosuppression and minimize hospital visits and admissions. The potentially severe outcomes for patients with cancer affected by COVID-19 were reported especially by Liang et al (17) . This finding might be explained by the fact that the pool of cancer patients was bigger and these patients are not only immunocompromised but are definitely exposed to a wide range of side effects of anti-tumor therapy. Of course, also the role of age and other underlying comorbidities must be taken into account.

Firstly, the limited number of included papers and the very small sample size did not allow to perform any statistical analysis. Secondly, the number of pediatric patients was not comparable to that of adults and the number of transplant recipients and patients with immunodeficiency was too small compared to cancer patients. For this reason, it was not possible to statistically compare outcomes between these sub-groups. As another limit, one of the studies, by Guan et al (5) , reported outcomes by comorbidity and age groups separately, not specifying whether children were present among patients with cancer, leading to possibly incomplete data on the pediatric population. Moreover, we only considered studies published in English, thus studies in Chinese or other languages have necessarily been missed. Lastly, due to the rapid development of the situation worldwide, we cannot exclude the publication of other studies or reports that our search algorithm may have missed.",

Also immunosuppressed adults without further comorbidities appear to have no increased risk of a more severe disease. The major risk factors for a worse outcome appear to remain elderly age, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems, along with male sex. For sure, immunosuppressed patients are not immune to COVID-19, and when infected, especially if presenting a mild disease, as it seems to be likely in the majority of cases, they may be underdiagnosed and become an important source for viral shedding. Nevertheless, surveillance on this special population should be encouraged, also taking into account that the current outbreak should not dissuade from performing life-saving procedures like transplantation or starting or continuing therapies such as chemotherapy for cancer, both in children and in adults.

The patient presented at first mild gastrointestinal symptoms and fever, and after five days, respiratory symptoms (unilateral pneumonia) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. On admission, immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus and everolimus was discontinuated, and, after 72 hours of supportive and anti-viral treatment, he required invasive ventilation in ICU. He was treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and Interferon Beta. At the time of the report, he was stable, under respiratory supportive therapy. In this patient, COVID-19 had at first an atypical presentation, starting with mild, aspecific symptoms, with a subsequent respiratory involvement, determining a severe disease course, perhaps due to the multiple comorbidities, and in line with the general population (14).
