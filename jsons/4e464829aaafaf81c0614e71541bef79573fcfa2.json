The disease first emerged in mid November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. 1 Once it reached Hong Kong in late February, the disease spread very rapidly to other parts of the world by international air travel. 1 The rapidity with which the disease has spread indicated that the causative agent is infectious and virulent. The relatively long incubation period of up to 10 days 2 allows the virus to be transported globally by air travellers, many of whom did not show any symptoms of illness prior to their travel. The World Health Organization (WHO) named this atypical pneumonia 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)' because of its severity. 3 The cost to the economy has been esti-mated to be US$30 billion in the Far East alone. 4 The WHO and several governments issued travel advice to hard-hit areas. Hospitals, schools and borders were closed. In addition to the thousands of individuals who contracted the disease and the hundreds who died from it, thousands were quarantined and isolated.

Within three weeks of the outbreak in Hong Kong, the microorganism responsible for the disease was identified by scientists at the University of Hong Kong to be a novel coronavirus. 19, 20 This was subsequently confirmed by several other groups. 20, 21 The genome of this virus was sequenced, also within two months. [22] [23] [24] [25] Coronaviruses are known to be associated with a variety of diseases in humans and domestic animals, including respiratory tract infections (common cold in humans) and gastroenteritis. 26 It has been postulated that the proximity of humans to wild animals might have led to animal pathogens jumping across species from animals to humans, and become the causative pathogen in the latter. It is important to determine whether there is an animal reservoir, as breaking transmission of the virus may be more difficult and a recurrence of the disease is more likely. While some investigators suggested that the virus mutates rapidly, as the strain responsible for the Amoy Gardens outbreak appeared to cause a more serious disease with diarrhoea as a prominent feature, scientists in Singapore found that the virus is rather stable. 25 Preliminary studies of samples from patients using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique have demonstrated the presence of the RNA of SARS-virus in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) in 31% on day 2, 43% on day 3-5, and 60% of patients from 6 to 8 days to 2 weeks after onset of the illness and in stool samples in almost 100% of patients at the end of 2 weeks. 27 Thirty-two out of 316 (10%) exposed asymptomatic subjects had positive RT-PCR for coronavirus in their NPA. 27 It is unknown at present whether asymptomatic carriers are infectious or not, a factor important for disease control.
