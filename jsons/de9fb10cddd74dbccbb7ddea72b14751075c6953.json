The N protein of BtCoV92 showed 90 % identity with that of the diliman-1525G2 virus and they clustered in the same branch in the N protein phylogenetic analysis ( Fig. 4a and b) . Similarly, when using a partial N protein sequence (461 amino acids, 8 missing amino acids from position 351-358 of the N protein), BtCoV22/29 clustered together with BtCoV92 and diliman-1525G2 virus during phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4b) . In a previous study, a betacoronavirus (KX452687) was detected in local E. spelaea [42] and when comparing the N protein partial sequences with those of BtCoV92, BtCoV22/29, these sequences clustered under a different branch from KX452687 in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4a ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 727, "end": 731, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 939, "end": 943, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1066, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1812, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 229, "end": 237, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 732, "end": 740, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1481, "text": "Fig. 4a and b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1722, "text": "(Fig. 4b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1989, "end": 1997, "text": "(Fig. 4a", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Genome characterization of the novel bat CoV"}, {"text": "In 2015 [39] , emerging diseases with epidemic potential were identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as targets for outbreak preparedness, and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were both in the list [43] .

These bats were the most frequently counted bats during the island-wide surveillance and are commonly found in parks, where their food sources (fruit trees) are widely distributed. They are well adapted to living closely with humans, which inevitably increases the risk of disease transmission and the emergence of zoonoses [45] . Previously, flaviviruses (Phnom Penh virus, Carey island virus and Jugra virus), Nipah virus and betacoronaviruses have been found in C. brachyotis [39, 46, 47] . Obtaining the full-genome sequences for CoVs from field samples has always been challenging for multiple reasons: (1) the CoV genome (26-32 kb) is the largest non-segmented RNA viral genome known to date [15] ; (2) CoV genomes are genetically highly variable due to the high frequency of recombination among CoVs [48] [48, 49] ; and (3) the absolute amount and relative percentage of viral nucleic acid is generally very low in clinical/field samples. In the current study, we developed a CoV-targeted probe-based enrichment strategy to improve the efficiency of CoV genome characterization. As a proof of concept, we applied this CoV-enrichment NGS strategy to rapidly characterize the first complete CoV genome sequence in Singapore from a novel CoV detected in C. brachyotis.
