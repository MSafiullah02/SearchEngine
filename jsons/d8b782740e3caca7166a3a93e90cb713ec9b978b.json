This perceived low quality of information of a positive test result may be a great impediment to promote or justify testing, and it may de-legitimize taking appropriate measures (e.g., wearing face masks, washing hands, forbidding mass meetings or travel), especially if other, non-cognitive, bottle necks occur. For instance, it may be quite costly (reportedly some 45 Euro per test in Robbio 2 in Italy) or rather time-consuming to test an individual, hence a re-test after a positive test result would be unattractive looking at it from the resourceprovision side of the problem, although re-testing in this case will be much, much more informative. An additional bottle neck might be that tests may not be available in sufficient numbers. 3 Then, a priority or a legitimization problem arises: to use the scarce test for testing people for the first time, or for retesting positives. Especially combinations of these bottle necks, and they have materialized at crucial moments in the Corona crisis, may lead to questioning the usefulness of testing at all.",

We however think there is a psychological connection between the missing base-rate problem and the base-rate fallacy. We suggest that it is very likely that a missing base rate shifts the interpretation of the test's result unpredictably anywhere between giving a lot of weight (if not all) to the individuating information, or vice versa in which having no anchor for the base rate at all might psychologically mean base rate equals zero.",

Obviously, larger tests provide better answers if the base rate is stationary. We have the following reasons for this additional ambition. In case of a disease spreading, the assumption of stationarity is frivolous, so then more is not necessarily better, more recent might be better. Moreover, crucial measures may be triggered by data on an aggregate level, but cannot be delayed until results from large numbers of tests 2 https://it.businessinsider.com/esclusiva-cosa-rivelano-i-primi-test-di-robbio-primo-paeseitaliano-a-fare-i-test-sullimmunita-a-tutti-i-cittadini/ 3 At the moment of writing a problem in the Netherlands. The Dutch government had the aim of testing 17,000 people per day from a certain date onwards, but this date has gone by and the maximum daily number of tests taken in reality is approximately 7,000. have accrued. Furthermore, a sequence of estimated priors (using low numbers of tests) taken at different moments in time, may provide information regarding the stationarity issue, in other words: is it spreading or not?
