Microorganisms were recorded if they were detected in sputum, blood cultures, or both.(4)Fresh heparinized arterial blood samples were collected for blood gases\u2019 analysis, on room air (on AVL-autoanlyzer-Roche).(5)Serology for atypicals including Chlamydia pneumonia IgA/IgM/IgG, Coxiella bruntii IgM/IgG, legionella pneumonia IgM/IgG, Mycoplasma pneumonia IgA/IgM/IgG, using (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) ELISA which is an immunoassay, suited to the determination of antibodies in the field of infectious serology. The reaction is based on the specific interaction of antibodies with their corresponding antigen. Therefore, the test strips of the SERION ELISA classic micro-titer plate are coated with specific antigens of the pathogen of interest. If antibodies in the patient\u0301s serum sample are present, they bind to the fixed antigen. A secondary antibody, which has been conjugated with the enzyme alkaline phosphatase, detects the immune complex. The colorless substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate is then converted into the colored product p-nitro phenol. The signal intensity of the reaction product is proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the sample and is measured photometrically.(6)Urine test for Legionella antigen.(7)Sputum or nasopharyngeal swab for PCR to detect respiratory viruses included, Influenza A/B IgA/IgM/IgG, Para-influenza virus 1, 2, 3 IgA/IgG, Herpes simplex virus 1/2 IgA/IgM/IgG, Cytomegalovirus IgM/IgG, Epstein \u2013 Barr virus IgG/IgM,Herpes Simplex Virus 1/2 IgM/IgG. Pathogen detection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is based on the amplification of specific regions of pathogen genome. In real time PCR the amplified product is detected via florescent dyes. These are linked to oligonucleotide probes that bind specifically to the amplified product. Monitoring the fluorescence intensities during the PCR run (i.e. real-time) allows the detection and quantification of the accumulating product without having to re-open the reaction tubes after the PCR run. The ARTUS SARS RG RT-PCR kit was used to detect the novel coronal virus. The artus SARS RG RT-PCR Kit is based on the amplification and simultaneous detection of a specific region of the SARS corona virus genome using real-time PCR. The kit provides high levels of specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. Each artus SARS RG RT-PCR Kit provides 4 quantitation standards. The use of standards enables accurate quantitation of viral load. In addition, the kit contains a second heterologous amplification system to identify possible PCR inhibition. This is detected as an internal control (IC) in a different fluorescence channel from the analytical PCR. The detection limit of the analytical SARS corona virus RT-PCR is not reduced.(8)Venous blood samples were collected from patients in 2 tubes, 2 ml of blood was delivered into EDTA tube to perform complete blood picture on the automatic cell counter.(9)The remaining amounts of blood were coagulated then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, one part of the separated serum was used to assay blood chemistry (on Hitachi 911-Roche) and CRP concentration (on Axyem, Bayer-Germany), a value of CRP > 8 mg/L was considered abnormally elevated [14].(10)The second part of the serum was stored in aliquots at \u221270 \u00b0C for measurements of PCT until time of assay.\n",

In LIA, PCT covalently bound to paramagnetic particles for limited binding sites on acridine ester-labeled antibody. An inverse relationship exists between the concentrations of labeled antibody bound to the antigen PCT in the patient sample. This triggers the chemiluminescent reaction that results in the emission of photons of light. The photo multiplier tube detects the photon of light emitted and converts them into electrical pulses. The instrument counts these electrical pulses, reads the results off the master curve defined for the assay. The results were calculated from the standard curve in ng/ml. The detection limit of the assay was 0.1 ng/mL [15].",

PCT was increased significantly in bacteremic patients compared with patients without an identified bacterial pathogen [27]. Another study focused on the potential of PCT to differentiate patients with a viral respiratory infection with or without bacterial super infection. This was investigated in patients with confirmed influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in a critical care setting. PCT had differentiated the patients with bacterial super-infection from patients with viral pneumonia only [28]. Different studies have evaluated the prognostic potential of PCT in patients with respiratory infections, mainly in patients with CAP, the greatest benefit of PCT was found in patients classified as high risk by the pneumonia severity index score. Having a PCT < 0.1 ng/ml can exclude mortality in high-risk patients. Subsequent repeated measurements of PCT in this population demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with falling PCT levels [29]. In addition, the study found that PCT was more helpful in predicting serious adverse events, such as ICU admission or CAP-related complications [30].",

Clinical follow-up with re-measurement of PCT within 6\u201324 h should be considered in all patients in whom antibiotics are withheld but who show clinical deterioration. If PCT is >0.25 ng/ml, and particularly >0.5 ng/ml, a bacterial infection becomes more likely and necessitates antibiotic therapy.(2)For patients who are clinically stable but presented with pneumonia, a PCT level >0.25 ng/ml strongly suggests that a bacterial infection and antibiotic therapy should be initiated, PCT should be reassessed every 2 days. Antibiotics may be discontinued if a patient shows clinical recovery and PCT decreases to <0.25 ng/ml (or by at least 80% to 90% from the peak level). Highly elevated PCT levels in this situation make bacteremic disease more likely and suggest that the infection may be more severe than expected based on clinical signs and symptoms. In patients suspected of having a pneumonia based on the presence of radiological infiltrates, a persistent (>24\u201348 h) PCT level of <0.1 ng/ml or even 0.1 ng/ml to <0.25 ng/ml argues against a typical bacterial infection, and physicians should consider the unusual pneumonias as pulmonary embolism, acute heart failure, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and viral pneumonia particularly during flu season. If antibiotics are withheld initially, PCT should be rechecked after 6 to 24 h. If PCT levels are <0.25 ng/ml but bacterial infection is still highly suspected based on the clinical presentation or microbiologic results, antibiotic therapy should be considered. If PCT remains low during follow-up, early discontinuation of antibiotics should be considered, as well as an aggressive diagnostic workup for other causes.(3)For high-risk or patients in the ICU with severe respiratory infection (Fig 2B), empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated. Still, an initial PCT level of <0.5 ng/ml argues against a typical bacterial infection, and other diagnoses should be considered, including viral causes, repeating the PCT level at 6\u201324 h in high-risk patients may be important so as not to miss the evolution of the inflammatory cascade, similar to the strategy used for serial troponins in monitoring cardiac ischemia. If PCT levels do not decrease or remaining high, treatment failure should be considered and reassessment of patients is recommended.\n",
