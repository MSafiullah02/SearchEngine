            "text": "IL-10 is an important immunoregulatory cytokine with non-redundant functions that plays a critical role in determining the balance between inflammation and immune regulation by influencing antigen presentation, T cell differentiation, cytokine production, and intensity of inflammation (Couper et al., 2008, Moore et al., 2001). A variety of cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T cells, can produce IL-10 (Moore et al., 2001, Saraiva and O'Garra, 2010, Wack et al., 2011) and the timing of IL-10 production after infection is key: IL-10 production prior to pathogen clearance may facilitate persistent, chronic infection, while delayed IL-10 production may foster immune-mediated pathology (Wack et al., 2011). Most investigations examining the role of IL-10 during virus infections have focused on persistent infections, but IL-10 production is also important in the pathogenesis of acute virus infections and is produced at the height of the inflammatory response during acute influenza A virus, simian virus 5, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infections (Palmer et al., 2010, Puntambekar et al., 2011, Sun et al., 2009, Trandem et al., 2011b).",

These Tregs express the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) and, in a positive feed forward loop, respond to IL-10 by producing more IL-10 (Chaudhry et al., 2011). Th17 cells also express the IL-10R and Treg-derived IL-10 restricts Th17 cell development and production of pathogenic mediators (Huber et al., 2011). The CD8+ T cells that produce IL-10 are also highly cytolytic suggesting that as molecules are produced to clear infection they also begin to produce IL-10 to regulate their inflammatory capacity and modulate the consequences of the immune response (Trandem et al., 2011b). Although T cells are important producers of IL-10, intrinsic cells of the CNS can also produce IL-10 and early production at the site of infection by a virus engineered to express IL-10 provides protection against pathology later in disease (Trandem et al., 2011a). These data suggest that both early and late IL-10 production may be important in regulating the immunopathological consequences of virus infection in the CNS.",

            "text": "Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne, positive-sense RNA virus in the family Togaviridae. SINV, the prototypical alphavirus, is related to Venezuelan, eastern, and western equine encephalitis viruses that cause seasonal epidemics of encephalomyelitis in horses and humans (Go et al., 2014, Hollidge et al., 2010). SINV causes a mild, arthritic disease in humans, but is neuronotropic and produces encephalomyelitis in mice (Johnson, 1965, Taylor et al., 1955). Neuroadapted SINV (NSV) causes uniformly fatal disease in C57Bl/6 (B6) mice after intranasal or intracerebral infection as a result of immune-mediated damage (Greene et al., 2008, Rowell and Griffin, 2002, Thach et al., 2000) for which both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been implicated (Rowell and Griffin, 2002). IL-10 regulates this immunopathology by specifically modulating a pathogenic Th17 response that develops within the CNS of susceptible B6 mice in response to infection (Kulcsar et al., 2014). Tregs are implicated as a source of IL-10 because in resistant Balb/cJ mice a robust IL-10-producing Treg response is associated with survival (Kulcsar et al., 2015). Therefore, IL-10 is an important immune modulator during NSV infection, but the cellular sources of this cytokine in the CNS and their relative importance during lethal infection are not known.",

Analysis of these mice showed that IL-10 was expressed in the CNS after infection, but not in the draining cervical lymph nodes, and that the predominant IL-10-expressing cells were CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with little contribution from myeloid cells. Within the CD4+ T cell compartment CD25+ and CD25\u2212 cells expressed IL-10. Examination of mice deficient in IL-10 production specifically in T cells (IL-10CD4KO) or in myeloid cells (IL-10LysMKO) identified T cells as the predominant source of IL-10 that restricts Th17 as well as Th1/Th17 cell development in the CNS.

Previously, we showed that IL-10 was an important cytokine for immune modulation and protection during NSV infection (Kulcsar et al., 2015, Kulcsar et al., 2014).

To compensate for this, we subtracted the FITC channel signal from WT mice for all cell types at the same time points to determine the level of eGFP expression above background. Five days after infection, 7.14% of T cells expressed IL-10eGFP, which was higher than the percentage of microglia expressing IL-10eGFP (0.66%, P = 0.0051) (Fig. 2A, B).

IL-10 production selectively knocked-out in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the amount of Il10 mRNA expressed (Fig. 3). To determine the dynamics of IL-10 production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, T cell subsets were evaluated in VertX mice for expression of IL-10eGFP in the brain 5 d and 7 d after infection and in the spinal cord at 7 d when there were enough T cells to reliably detect IL-10eGFP expression (Fig. 4\n). Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the brains and spinal cords of NSV-infected mice expressed IL-10eGFP. The numbers of CD4+\n IL-10eGFP+ cells increased from 1.87 \u00d7 103 cells per brain 5 d after infection to 3.63 \u00d7 104 cells per brain 7 d after infection (P = 0.0382, Fig. 4A, C).

In the absence of IL-10, more pathogenic Th17 cells, as well as Th1/Th17 cells, are present in the CNS at the onset of paralysis and contribute to accelerated morbidity and mortality (Kulcsar et al., 2014). In WT mice, the primary source of IL-10 is T cells, not myeloid cells (Fig. 3). To verify that IL-10 produced by T cells is responsible for regulating the Th17 response during viral encephalomyelitis, we compared the CD4+ T cell skewing of IL-10CD4-KO and IL-10LysM-KO mice to IL-10fl/fl littermates, WT, and IL-10 KO mice. Cells isolated from brains 5 d after infection, when differences in the Th17 response between WT and IL-10 KO mice are the greatest (Kulcsar et al., 2014), were stimulated ex vivo. To identify Th1, Th17, and Th1/Th17 responses, CD4+ T cells were evaluated for the production of IFN\u03b3, IL-17a, and co-production of IFN\u03b3 and IL-17a, respectively (Fig. 6\n). There were no significant differences in the Th1 responses as measured by numbers or percentages of IFN\u03b3-producing CD4+ T cells. However, the Th17 responses were different (Fig. 6A\u2013C). As expected, WT and IL-10fl/fl mice had similar Th17 responses while in IL-10 KO mice there was a higher percentage (P = 0.0011; Fig. 6A, F) and more (P = 0.0422; Fig. 6G) CD4+\n IL-17a+ T cells than in WT mice. IL-10CD4-KO mice also had an increased Th17 response compared to IL-10fl/fl littermates. Approximately 2.3% of the CD4+ T cells from IL-10fl/fl mice produced IL-17a compared to 5.3% in IL-10CD4-KO mice (P = 0.0072; Fig. 6A, F). This resulted in almost twice as many CD4+\n IL-17a+ T cells in the IL-10CD4-KO mice (P = 0.0018; Fig. 6G). The IL-10LysM-KO mice had Th17 responses similar to WT and IL-10fl/fl mice (Fig. 6F, G).",

The IL-10LysM-KO mice showed no difference in the course of disease or the time of death compared to IL-10fl/fl mice consistent with their similar Th1 and Th17 responses (Fig. 7C, D). However, IL-10CD4-KO also had a similar course of disease compared to IL-10fl/fl mice (Fig. 7A, B). Although the Th17 response was elevated in IL-10CD4-KO mice, it was less than observed in IL-10 KO mice suggesting that a threshold for an increase in disease severity was not reached.

Therefore, effector, as well as regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells differentiated in the CNS to become important sources of IL-10 that modulated the inflammatory response and development of Th17 and Th1/Th17 cells.",

            "text": "Cells in the brain and spinal cord produced IL-10, whereas few IL-10-expressing cells were found in the draining CLN indicating acquisition of this function after entry into the CNS. Tissue-specific expression of IL-10 also occurs during CNS infection with the gliatropic JHM strain of MHV (Puntambekar et al., 2011, Trandem et al., 2011b). These data suggest that although virus-specific T cells are generated in the draining CLN, they do not begin producing IL-10 until they reach the site of infection. Similarly, during influenza virus infection the majority of IL-10+ T cells are in the lung, not in the draining LN or spleen (McKinstry et al., 2009). However, a recent study showed that with ex vivo stimulation virus-specific Tregs in the draining CLNs do produce IL-10 (Zhao et al., 2014) suggesting that some T cell subsets are programmed to produce this regulatory cytokine prior to encountering the milieu of the inflamed CNS. Together, these data suggest that T cell production of IL-10 is dependent on the environment and the level of stimulation (Saraiva and O'Garra, 2010). Contributing factors may include the local presence of cytokines that stimulate IL-10 production such as IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 (Li and Flavell, 2008, Lee et al., 2013).",

A significant increase in the Th17 and Th1/Th17 response in mice lacking T cell-derived IL-10, but not in mice lacking myeloid cell-derived IL-10, indicated that T cells were the primary source of IL-10 regulating the CNS development of Th17 cells. However, the increase of Th17 cells in IL-10CD4 KO mice was less than that observed in mice completely deficient in IL-10 and did not have a significant impact on the course of disease. These data suggest that although T cell-derived IL-10 modulates the Th17 and Th1/Th17 responses, other sources of IL-10 also participate in regulation. Most microglia and dendritic cells from lymphoid tissues do not express LysM, thus these cells will maintain the ability to produce IL-10 in the IL-10LysM KO mice (Clausen et al., 1999, Goldmann et al., 2013, Siewe et al., 2006) even if it is at low levels.
