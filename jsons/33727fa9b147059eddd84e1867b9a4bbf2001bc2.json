It was during this time that we also had our first COVID positive cardiac arrest. Given good communication from the patient's family to the public safety answering point, appropriate warning was provided to the emergency medical services (EMS). This information led to crews notifying the emergency department of impending arrival of infectious patient allowing staff to don appropriate personal protection equipment.",

If a potential COVD patient presents to our ED, EMS is able to easily enter the room with the patient. This prevents a potentially infectious patient from travelling thought the ED and contaminating other areas. As found in a typical resuscitation room, we placed a stretcher in the room along with basic medical equipment (Image 1) such as bag valve masks, intravenous access sets, and suction. Oxygen is supplied by a portable tank. The code cart is kept just outside the inner door leading into the ED. Seen on the bed is a patient respiratory protection unit that we designed to help limit aerosolization exposure to staff. 4 In order to limit breaks in care and equipment contamination, the EMS cardiac monitor and defibrillator is left connected to the patient and used as the monitor during the resuscitation. If return of spontaneous circulation is obtained, the patient could then be transferred to hospital monitor. In order to limit contamination of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f other routinely used equipment such as video laryngoscopy and ultrasound, we switched to portable devices that can easily cleaned and decontaminated after use.",
