We investigated the role of IERSR during Leishmania amazonensis infection. Treatment of RAW 264.7 infected macrophages with the ER stress-inducing agent thapsigargin (TG; 1 mM) increased L. amazonensis infectivity in an IFN1-a receptor (IFNAR)dependent manner. In Western blot assays, we showed that L. amazonensis activates the inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1)/ X-box binding protein (XBP)-1-splicing arms of the IERSR in host cells. In chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we showed an increased occupancy of enhancer and promoter sequences for the Ifnb gene by XBP1 in infected RAW 264.7 cells. Knocking down XBP1 expression by transducing RAW 264.7 cells with the short hairpin XBP1 lentiviral vector significantly reduced the parasite proliferation associated with impaired translocation of phosphorylated IFN regulatory transcription factor (IRF)-3 to the nucleus and a decrease in IFN1-b expression. Knocking down XBP1 expression also increased NO concentration, as determined by Griess reaction and reduced the expression of antioxidant genes, such as heme oxygenase (HO)-1, that protect parasites from oxidative stress. We conclude that L. amazonensis activation of XBP1 plays a critical role in infection by protecting the parasites from oxidative stress and increasing IFN1-b expression.-Dias-Teixeira, K.

Approximately 200,000-400,000 new visceral leishmaniasis cases and 700,000-1,200,000 new cutaneous leishmaniasis cases occur each year worldwide (1) . Leishmania amazonensis belongs to the Leishmania mexicana complex and causes localized cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (2) . These parasites often hijack the host's innate immune response to establish a successful infection, particularly in macrophages. We have shown that L. amazonensis parasites induce IFN1-b expression via RNAdependent protein kinase (PKR) in a TLR2-dependent manner (3) and that IFN1-b favors parasite growth. In addition, IFN1-a receptor (IFNAR) signaling favors L. amazonensis infection in mice (4) . Another component of host immune defense subverted by L. amazonensis is the reactive oxygen species (ROS) defense mechanism. We have shown that L. amazonensis suppresses NO production by repressing the iNOS expression via the NF-kB transcription factor, which is essential for progression of infection (5) . Finally, we have demonstrated that L. amazonensis infection induces superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1), which favors parasite growth (3) .",

The splicing results in a frame shift at the splice junction that also extends the open reading frame and gives rise to an activated form of XBP1 called spliced (s)XBP1. sXBP1 is an active transcription factor that induces transcription of a cluster of genes to expand the folding capacity of ER, promote ER-associated retrograde transport and degradation (ERAD) of unfolded proteins, and phospholipid synthesis, thereby promoting cell survival (7) (8) (9) . XBP1 was characterized in 1990 as a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP) transcription factor in B cells (10) . Activation of XBP1 in response to ER stress is well established. An unexpected finding was that XBP1 was also activated by TLR4 and -2 in macrophages in absence of ER stress. Tolllike receptor-mediated XBP1 activation leads to an increase in IL-6, IL-1b, and IFN-1b production (11) . In addition, XBP1 increases IFN-1b expression in cells under ER stress in a TLR4-and -3-dependent manner (12) . Activated sXBP1 recruits the IFN regulatory transcription factor (IRF)-3, and the histone acetylase complex cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) binding protein (CBP/p300) to the Ifnb enhancer promoter during ER stress, which is further enhanced by cotreatment with LPS (13) . Another important role for XBP1 is the prevention of oxidative stress. sXBP1 induces expression of antioxidant molecules such as SOD-1 and catalase; consistently XBP1-deficient cells produce more ROS (14) .",

In this study, we found that ER stress renders macrophages more susceptible to L. amazonensis infectioninanIFN\u0391R-dependent manner. L. amazonensis infection induces XBP1 splicing, its nuclear translocation, and its occupancy of the Ifnb enhancer and proximal promoter in macrophages. Knocking down XBP1 expression reduces L. amazonensis infection through reduction of IFN1-b expression associated with impaired phospho-IRF3 nuclear translocation. XBP1 knockdown also reduces heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression, and increases intracellular NO concentration. Our data demonstrate that L. amazonensis induces the IRE1a/XBP1 branch of the IERSR to escape cellular defense, particularly oxidative stress, and increases expression of IFN1-b,a ni m p o r t a n t cytokine that favors L. amazonensis infection.",

The infection index showed that activation of ER stress increased the parasite burden compared with that in nontreated cells (Fig. 1A) . This finding suggests that 1 or more components of the IERSR enhance parasite infection. To elucidate the molecular effectors of IERSR that enhance L. amazonensis infection, we first investigated the possible involvement of IFN1, because our earlier work had demonstrated that L. amazonensis induces IFN1-b expression and that this cytokine plays an important role in L. amazonensis growth (3) and because of the known role of XBP1 in IFN-1b expression (12, 13) . Our results indicated that enhanced parasite growth in TG-treated macrophages was dependent on type I IFNAR (Fig. 1B) . Primary macrophages with IFNAR deletion showed reduced L. amazonensis infection compared with that in WT counterparts after treatment with TG. We also observed a cooperative effect of TG treatment and L. amazonensis infection on IFN1-b expression in a qPCR assay (Fig. 1C) . Finally, TG treatment did not enhance the infection in TLR2-KO macrophages (Supplemental Fig. 1 ), suggesting that this agent enhances parasite infectivity in a TLR2-dependent manner.",

Induction of IFN-1b mRNA by L. amazonensis infection was impaired in XBP1 knockdown cells. This effect was accompanied by reduced IRF3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 5B) . To provide further support for our contention that activation of XBP1 leads to IFN1 expression, thereby favoring the infection, we added recombinant IFN-a to parasite-infected, shXBP-transduced macrophages and measured the parasite growth. As expected, addition of recombinant IFN-1a significantly increased the levels of the parasites in XBP1-silenced macrophages (Fig. 5C) .

The phagocytosis of parasites duringinfectioncreatesanoxidative burst and induces the formation of ROS that act as a cellular defense against the parasite (20) . However, L. amazonensis parasites subvert these defense mechanisms to survive inside macrophages. To determine whether XBP-1 plays a role in subversion of host antioxidant defenses, we first determined the NO concentration in shXBP1-or scrambled shRNA-transduced cells. In these studies we observed that knocking down XBP1 expression increased nitrite concentration during L. amazonensis infection (Fig. 6A) . To further support the emerging hypothesis that sXBP1 protects cells from oxidative stress during L. amazonensis infection, we added NAC, an antioxidant agent, to shXBP1 cells infected with L. amazonensis and measured parasite growth. As expected, the addition of the antioxidant NAC significantly increased the parasite burden in shXBP1 macrophages (Fig.  6B) . Consistently, the shXBP1 transduced cells also showed a decrease in HO-1 protein levels compared with scrambled shRNA-transduced cells during L. amazonensis infection. These data further support our hypothesis that XBP1 plays an important role in regulating HO-1 expression and ROS levels during parasite infection (Fig. 6C) . Taken together, our data demonstrate conclusively that XBP1 plays a critical role in controlling the oxidative stress in L. amazonensisinfected cells, thereby promoting parasite survival and ensuring progression of infection.",

In response, the pathogens have developed sophisticated approaches for evading hosts' defenses. In this never-ending arms race between the host and the pathogen, pathogens very often hijack host defenses for survival. Leishmania is a pathogenic protozoan that successfully infects ;1 million people a year in Central and South America, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. Several studies have shown that this parasite may subvert elements of innate immunity for survival and proliferation in mammalian hosts (21, 22) . For example L. amazonensis induces IFN-1b expression in a TLR2-dependent manner (3) , which appears to favor parasite growth. Similarly, IFNAR signaling favors L. amazonensis (4) . L. amazonensis also subverts the ROS defense mechanism. Our group also showed that L. amazonensis suppresses NO production through iNOS repression in an NF-kB transcriptionfactor-dependent manner (5) . Moreover, L. amazonensis infection induces SOD-1, thus favoring parasite growth by reducing ROS accumulation (3). How L. amazonensis induces such responses to evade host defenses in a coordinated manner remains poorly understood.",

Furthermore, sXBP1 is involved in processes not directly related to the IERSR response, such as gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and lipid metabolism (8) . Finally, XBP1 is activated byTLR4 and -2 in macrophages, with an increase in IL-6, IL-1b, and IFN-1b production in the absence of overt ER stress (11) . XBP1 increases IFN-1b expression after sequential treatment with TG followed by LPS, in a TLR4-and -3-dependent manner (12) . Induction of IFN-1b by sXBP1 and the wellestablished role of IFN signaling in L. amazonensis pathogenesis suggest that sXBP1 plays a role in this parasite's evasion of host defenses.

Addition of the antioxidant agent NAC to XBP1 knockdown cells restored L. amazonensis growth, demonstrating conclusively that XBP1 activation plays a critical role in the L. amazonensis infection by preventing host cells from mounting an effective oxidative stress response (Fig. 6 ). L. amazonensis-infected XBP1 knockdown cells also showed lower HO-1 expression, suggesting a role for XBP1 in HO-1 expression (Fig. 6 ). These data demonstrate that XBP1 plays an important role in regulating oxidative stress during L. amazonensis infection. Down-regulation of antioxidant defenses by sXBP1 promotes parasite growth and the progression of infection. These data are consistent with previous reports that sXBP1 plays important roles in regulating the oxidative stress response, most likely because of its effects on expression of SOD-1 and catalase, 2 critical antioxidant genes (14) . Figure 7 explains the role of XBP1 during L. amazonensis infection. The coordinated induction of type I IFN and suppression of oxidative stress response by XBP1 cooperatively facilitate parasite proliferation and play a critical role in L. amazonensis pathogenicity. We showed that TLR2 is necessary for a TGinduced parasite burden. The data suggest a scenario in which TLR2 and perhaps other TLRs are involved in XBP1's effect on the infection.Molecular mechanisms by which L. amazonensis activates XBP1 are poorly understood. It is conceivable that the formation of the large parasitophorous vacuole, originated by the fusion of membranes from cell compartments including ER, may activate the IERSR in infected cells.In summary, our data demonstrate conclusively that XBP1 has a critical role in L. amazonensis infection, via a type I IFN-dependent mechanism. The results highlight the importance of XBP1 in L. amazonensis infection and suggest that IERSR inducers, such as viral coinfections may potentiate the parasite infection. This hypothesis is currently under investigation by our group. The molecular mechanism by which L. amazonensis activates XBP1 and sXBP1 in turn suppresses oxidative stress in parasiteinfected cells should be investigated further.The authors declare no conflicts of interest.",
