Remarkably, protein\u2010templated fragment ligation reactions following this definition are the established mode of action of several clinically admitted drugs, which suggests that the reactions can indeed proceed efficiently under physiological conditions. For example, the anti\u2010Parkinson drug carbidopa binds to the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase and reacts with the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate to form a hydrazone as the active inhibitor (Figure 2 A).4 Likewise, the anticonvulsive drug vigabatrin reacts in a protein\u2010templated mode with the cofactor of GABA transaminase to form a Michael acceptor intermediate, which leads to the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme (Figure 2 B).5 Other examples of protein\u2010templated fragment ligations in admitted drugs are found for selegiline6 (reacts with cofactor FAD in the depression target monoamine oxidase) and for isoniazid (reacts with NAD+ in mycobacterium tuberculosis catalase).\n",

Reversible reactions, which have been studied in the context of dynamic covalent chemistry7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and irreversible reactions, also denominated as target\u2010guided synthesis (TGS),15 are treated together, as both reaction categories deliver examples of templated fragment ligations and in many cases it is difficult to categorize one reaction unambiguously. Representative recent applications of templated ligations in fragment\u2010based drug discovery are reported in Section 5, thus demonstrating how far the method has developed to date. Finally, in Section 6 we will discuss the current state of protein\u2010templated fragment ligations, considering the strengths of this method and the requirements for it to succeed. The complementarity of the method with classical ligand screening and fragment\u2010based methods will be considered, thereby leading to an outlook on the relevance and further development of protein\u2010templated fragment ligations for future drug discovery.",

The main reason for this detection problem is the low affinity of protein\u2010binding fragments requiring high fragment concentrations to generate and possibly saturate the detection signal. In some assays, such as fluorescence anisotropy or saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR, high protein concentrations can be used instead to saturate the binding of the small\u2010molecule ligand. Compared to other fragment\u2010based methods without ligation, the detection problem, however, is significantly reduced in protein\u2010templated fragment ligations due to the higher affinity of the fragment ligation product formed. As a result, fragment ligation assays can, in principle, detect even low\u2010affinity fragments that would not be identified in other fragment assays, for example, because of concentration limits. In general, fragments have to be present at concentrations that exceed their dissociation constants (K\nD values) by a factor of at least 10 for a strong, saturated detection signal to be measured. In contrast, in the case of a fragment ligation assay, concentrations of the starting fragment below the K\nD value are typically used to effect only partial inhibition, which can be saturated by the formation of the stronger binding ligation product.",

Some limitations remain, however. As chromatographic separation takes some time, LC\u2010MS detection is best suited for irreversible or quasi\u2010irreversible ligation reactions.15, 49 In the case of reversibly formed ligation products, their chemical fixation by a chemical reaction or a pH shift can be an option. This strategy was followed, for example, in the seminal report by Huc and Lehn on \u201cvirtual chemical libraries\u201d, in which the unstable imine ligation products were converted into stable amines by chemical reduction during the ligation reaction.21 A second limitation of LC\u2010MS detection can arise from the buffer systems used in fragment ligation reactions. Many buffer ions used in ligation assays interfere with the detection of ligation products in the mass detector, whereas buffer salts such as ammonium formiate or acetate that are highly compatible with LC\u2010MS may interfere with the ligation reaction by adding reactive nucleophiles in strong excess. In recent years, the detection of protein\u2010binding fragments by native protein MS has developed into a mature technology and it is very likely that this method will also be useful for the detection of fragment ligation products.50, 51, 52, 53\n",

The throughput can be enhanced if mixtures of reactive fragments are employed that undergo reversible, covalent ligation reactions.33, 55, 56, 57 These mixtures are denominated as dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCL), or dynamic covalent libraries, and can in principle form all possible combinations of the available fragment building blocks, that is, in the case of n and m complementary reactive building blocks, a number of n\u00d7m possible products are obtained.

For a proof of concept study, \u03b2\u2010galactosidase was selected as the target protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of O\u2010\u03b2\u2010galactosides and contains no cysteine residues in the active site. A mixture of five thiols and two aldehydes was employed, thereby resulting in the potential formation of ten hemithioacetals. It was demonstrated that 1\u2010\u03b2\u2010mercapto\u2010d\u2010galactose binds more strongly to the target enzyme than do the four other thiols and strongly enhanced the signals of both aldehydes in the STD spectrum\u2014presumably through the formation of hemothioacetals. Surprisingly, the binding of the two sugars could not be suppressed by the addition of substrate, thus suggesting additional allosteric binding sites for these fragments. Significant inhibition of substrate hydrolysis could be confirmed for one thiol\u2013aldehyde combination, which also suggests the formation of hemithioacetals as active inhibitors.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has also been used for the detection of fragment combinations.44 To reach the highest sensitivity, the primary reactive fragment has to be added to the enzyme assay at a concentration that results in 10\u201320 % inhibition, thereby leaving a measurement window of 80\u201390 % for detection of the enhanced inhibition after addition of the secondary fragment.\n",

A homogeneous protein\u2010binding assay for protein\u2010templated ligation reactions has been demonstrated by using fluorescence polarization (FP), also known as fluorescence anisotropy, for detection (Figure 7 C,D).47 For this assay, a reactive protein\u2010binding peptide fragment was labeled with a fluorophore. The FP ligand (10 nm) was dissolved in a buffer containing the target protein at a concentration leading to about 50 % ligand binding. Then a library of fragments was screened for those modulating the FP. The assay enabled the identification both of competing (Figure 7 C) and of enhancing fragments (Figure 7 D) in a single experiment, and the templating effect exerted by the protein was quantified for the best enhancing fragment combination. Reductive amination of the labeled fragment with the best enhancing fragment resulted in a picomolar inhibitor. Similar to the enzyme inhibition assays, homogeneous protein\u2010binding assays such as FP assays can be conducted in high\u2010throughput equipment, in small assay volumes, and at low (nm) protein concentrations, provided a ligand with sufficient affinity is available as a starting point.",

The 14\u20103\u20103 protein is involved in protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs), which are especially difficult to inhibit, as interactions of large and dynamic interaction surfaces have to be disrupted by molecules that are still able to penetrate cells through cellular uptake. The authors realized that the reactive aldehyde derivative of fusicoccin A (Fc, 1) binds in a hydrophobic cavity adjacent to the binding site of peptide 2, which contains a hydroxylamine functionality. They were able to demonstrate the templated formation of a heterobivalent ligation product, the potent oxime inhibitor 3, in vitro in the presence of 14\u20103\u20103 protein. Next, the authors investigated the intracellular formation of 3 in stably transformed HEK293 (Flag 14\u20103\u20103 \u03b6 cell line). HPLC analysis showed the formation of 3 in cells treated with 1 and 2, which led to the highest cytotoxic effect.

As a recent representative example of this line of research, we highlight the studies by Hirsch and co\u2010workers.36, 98 The authors employed endothiapepsin as a target and model enzyme for other aspartic acid proteases. Nine hydrazides (4\u201312) and one bisaldehyde were used to form a dynamic library derived from two fragment hits36 that bind to adjacent binding pockets of endothiapepsin (Figure 9).98 To ease analysis, two sublibraries (DCL\u20101 and DCL\u20102) were formed that consisted of four and five hydrazides. Reversed\u2010phase HPLC and LC\u2010MS were employed to analyze the templated formation of the bisacylhydrazone ligation products in the presence of endothiapepsin. Out of the potential 78 different bisacylhydrazones and 12 monoacylhydrazones, only 6 possible fragment combinations showed significant amplification of the HPLC signal in the presence of the endothiapepsin template. Two of the found combinations, 13 and 16, were synthesized and tested in a fluorescence\u2010based biochemical assay. Both were reported to be active, and the best inhibitor, 13, showed a 240\u2010fold increase in potency compared to the starting fragments, thus illustrating a successful example of a templated three\u2010fragment ligation reaction. The authors demonstrated in this study that, unlike other fragment optimization methods such as fragment growing or merging, templated fragment ligation is especially sensitive for discovering combined fragments with superadditivity, where their ligand efficiencies were not only maintained but improved. In their approach, the challenge lay in preserving the binding mode of the fragments and finding a well\u2010fitting linker that provides additional interactions to the target. Despite the positive results, the study also demonstrates the limitations of DCL, namely the tedious analysis of complex combinatorial mixtures and the limitation to few dynamic reactions that deliver non\u2010druglike products such as acylhydrazones.\n",

Further developments by the Erlanson group using so\u2010called \u201cextenders\u201d made this approach even more applicable for fragment combination reactions.133 In 2008 they reported an inhibitor screening that targeted the aurora kinase (Figure 11).134 The first step was to introduce a cysteine residue near the ATP binding site. Next, an extender was synthesized containing two disulfide\u2010containing residues and a diaminopyridine group, which is known to bind to the purine binding site. One disulfide residue was able to react and exchange with the introduced cysteine residue, the other one was able to bind a secondary disulfide fragment. If this secondary fragment was able to interact with the adaptive region of the protein adjacent to the extender, a thermodynamically stabilized disulfide bond was formed. This stabilized complex was subsequently detected by MS measurements through modification of the protein's mass. In their experiments, a library containing roughly 4500 disulfide\u2010containing fragments was screened in pools of 10 compounds, which resulted in the identification of several fragment combinations. A few modifications of the corresponding fragments led to the formation of a stable inhibitor with affinity in the micromolar range. A similar approach has been successfully applied to another kinase, 3\u2010phosphoinositide\u2010dependent protein kinase\u20101 (PDK1), by attaching the extender through an irreversible alkylation reaction.135\n",

Inhibitors targeting Mpro are, therefore, relevant as potential antivirals.136, 137 Since proteases possess defined binding pockets for the side chains of peptides, it was possible to develop a peptide aldehyde inhibitor that positions an electrophilic aldehyde precisely at the active site of the protease. Dynamic ligation screening of a fragment library of 234 diverse nucleophiles revealed several fragment hits that targeted the S1\u2032 pocket of the enzyme with K\nI values in the millimolar range. The best fragment hit was converted into the corresponding aldehyde fragment and assayed again for enhanced inhibition against an amine library, thereby providing a secondary hit fragment for the adjacent S1 pocket of the enzyme's binding site. Only two iterations of dynamic ligation screening starting from a peptide inhibitor resulted in the selection of two millimolar\u2010active small\u2010molecule fragments, and the covalent combination of these fragments by reductive amination revealed an entirely nonpeptidic inhibitor of SARS\u2010CoV Mpro with a K\nI value of 2.9 \u03bcm.\n",

By using 4\u2010formylphenyl phosphate as an electrophilic PTP substrate, specific secondary\u2010site binding fragments could be identified for each of the PTPs from a library of only 110 primary amines.

This leads to an amplified release of phosphate ions, which was determined in a Malachite green assay. Replacement of the phenyl phosphate substrate by a noncleavable phosphotyrosine mimetic and covalent linking to the selected MPTPA\u2010specific amine fragment furnished inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase A (MPTPA) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with no activity for the other three PTPs.

The second major advantage of protein\u2010templated fragment ligation assays is their sensitivity caused by the (super\u2010) additive binding enhancement of ligated fragments. As a result, fragment ligation assays can identify fragments that are not detectable with other fragment\u2010based discovery methods or only at considerably higher fragment or protein concentrations. Thus, the method may provide protein ligands with alternative structures and with improved ligand efficiencies. As a third advantage, protein\u2010templated fragment ligations have practical and economic benefits, mainly arising from the integration of the synthesis of fragment combinations and the detection of bioactivity in one step. As a result, the effort and the resources required for the chemical synthesis of bioactive ligands are reduced considerably, as only bioactive fragment combinations need to be resynthesized for further structural and functional validation.

The ultimate significance of protein\u2010templated fragment ligations will depend on to what extent they will contribute to fulfill the promise of fragment\u2010based drug discovery: Find better drugs with high potency, specificity, and fewer off\u2010target related side effects. Most likely, protein\u2010templated fragment ligations will contribute to this goal in close collaboration with other fragment\u2010based and classical lead discovery approaches. Beyond the practical success of the method in the drug discovery process, protein\u2010templated ligation reactions are also potent and attractive research and training tools that teach us how partial structures of a molecule can interact additively to create high\u2010affinity protein ligands. Through this, the method helps us to understand how molecular recognition makes the molecules of life work and how molecular evolution can proceed.",
