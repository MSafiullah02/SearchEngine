In children with pneumonia, RNA-seq detected 90% of pathogens detected by the EPIC study tests, and PVG PCR detected 57% (78% when excluding HRV and M. pneumoniae) (Table 2). In control subjects, the proportion detected was 64% by RNA-seq and 22% by PVG PCR (38% when excluding HRV) ( Table 2). Combining results of both methods, 93% of known pathogens in patients and 73% of known pathogens in control subjects were detected. Table 2 shows sensitivity and specificity for detection of each of the known pathogens. Calculations were based only on the tested samples. Results could be different when calculated for the entire EPIC study. A trend toward lower sensitivity in control subjects may be related to lower viral loads in asymptomatic children [29\u201334]. Of note, sensitivity was lowest for adenovirus for both methods; RNA-seq did not detect any of the 8 ADV-positive samples (n = 3 patients; n = 5 control subjects), whereas PVG PCR detected ADV in 1 of 3 patients and 3 of 5 control subjects. RNA sequencing detected HRV in 46 (92%) of 50 PCR-positive specimens, whereas PVG PCR detected 7 (14%) of 50. All M. pneumoniae infections were detected by RNA-seq but not targeted by PVG PCR.",

Human bocavirus, Coxsackieviruses, HPIV-4, HRV-C, and HRV-A were more commonly detected in children with CAP compared with control subjects, but only HBoV was statistically more common than in control subjects. This suggests that these pathogens may have played an etiologic role in CAP. Making an etiologic diagnosis in patients with pneumonia is important for understanding the epidemiology, providing appropriate therapy, and limiting unnecessary use of antimicrobials. However, extensive testing using standard approaches is unable to identify a pathogen in approximately 20% of children and approximately 60% of adults [4, 35]. Data from our proof-of-concept study of upper respiratory specimens suggest that RNA-seq and PVG PCR enable more comprehensive pathogen detection compared with virus-specific, real-time PCR-based tests. Although specimens from the upper respiratory tract can be collected without invasive procedure, they are most useful for identifying viral infections and have limited utility in testing for bacterial pneumonia.",

Coxsackievirus, HRV, ADV, HPIV, and measles virus were all more commonly detected in patients than control subjects (aOR > 2), but possibly due to the overall low frequency of these detections, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Human parechovirus and echovirus can cause respiratory tract infections but were detected infrequently in both patients and control subjects (aOR = 1.3 and 0.4, respectively). The 2 patients with measles virus detection did not show signs of measles but had been vaccinated 7 days (positive by RNA-seq only) and 9 days (positive by RNA-seq and PVG PCR) before sample collection, suggesting we detected vaccine strain.

Human bocavirus was not targeted as part of the EPIC study protocol due to uncertainty over its role as a human pathogen [37, 38]. Human bocavirus is a Parvovirus with a DNA genome and can be detected for weeks to months following acute infections, which makes it difficult to demonstrate its pathogenicity even in well-designed epidemiologic studies. Pan-viral group PCR detected HBoV DNA in 12 of 70 patients (17.1%) and 2 of 90 asymptomatic control subjects (2.2%). RNA sequencing identified HBoV mRNA in 10 of 70 patients (14.3%) and 0 of 90 asymptomatic control subjects (aOR = 31.4; 95% CI = 1.8\u2013546; P < .05). Sequencing reads spanning splice sites of the viral capsid mRNA [39] confirmed that mRNA rather than genomic DNA served as the sequencing template (data not shown). This strong association is in contrast with numerous PCR-based studies targeting viral genomic DNA [37, 40], suggesting that detection of HBoV mRNA may serve as a marker for acute (ie, clinically relevant) infections. Although these results will need to be confirmed in larger studies, our results suggest that HBoV may be associated with CAP and may be a true pathogen.",

In the absence of detectable RNA, active replication is unlikely, and their detection may be a result of reactivation or latent infection rather than acute infection. Lastly, we detected a number of viruses not known to cause respiratory tract infections, including EBV, anelloviruses, HHV7, polyomaviruses, and papillomavirus. Their detection in the nasopharynx and/or oropharynx of asymptomatic children as well as CAP patients (in validation and test-negative groups) is consistent with previous reports [41\u201347]. Their detection demonstrates both the power of comprehensive pathogen detection but also the importance of using appropriate controls. Interestingly, detection rates for these DNA viruses were much higher by DNA-based PVG PCR than by RNA-seq.

In contrast, PVG PCR identified DNA viruses that were not detected by RNA-seq. This may have been due in part to shedding predominantly of viral particles (containing genomic DNA) with low levels of active replication (ie, production of mRNA) in the upper respiratory tract.

In addition to the sequence data analysis described above, we also performed de novo assembly of RNA-seq results and searched resulting contiguous sequences for conserved protein profiles [48] on all data from children with CAP without identifying additional putative pathogens (data not shown). Despite these extensive efforts, a potential pathogen was still not detected in 46 children (65.7%) with CAP of unknown etiology. This could have been due to testing of NP/OP swabs and not lower respiratory tract samples, which are preferred for detection of bacterial and fungal pathogens; focus on viral pathogens; inadequate timing of sample collection; polymicrobial infections caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens; or noninfectious mimics. Use of broad-range methods may provide even greater benefits in the 60% of adults with CAP in whom no pathogen is detected using conventional approaches [35]. Our findings also highlight the limits of etiologic diagnosis of CAP with noninvasive samples. We cannot exclude that highly diverse viruses without homology to known human viral pathogens may have caused CAP in some of the children. Further advancing the diagnosis of CAP is likely to require additional sampling as well as host-based markers of infectious processes that may help confirm infectious etiologies even when a pathogen cannot be directly detected [49].",
