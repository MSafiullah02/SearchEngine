The sensitivity of coronaviruses towards CBA was shown to be dependent on the processing of the N-linked carbohydrates. Inhibition of mannosidases in host cells rendered the progeny viruses more sensitive to the mannose-binding agents and even to the N-acetylglucosaminebinding UDA. In addition, inhibition of coronaviruses was shown to be dependent on the cell-type used to grow the virus stocks. All together, these results show that CBA exhibit promising capabilities to inhibit coronavirus infections.",

            "text": "Development of intervention strategies for coronavirus infections has been boosted after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus epidemic. Successes have been recorded but the demand for antiviral chemotherapeutics that are safe and active in low concentrations perpetuates the search for new compounds. The use of interferons 1 and human monoclonal antibodies 2,3 is under research in case of a re-emergence of the SARS coronavirus. Further, coronavirus entry, including fusion, proteases and viral RNA were already envisaged as antiviral targets. 4, 5 The heavily glycosylated coronavirus envelope constitutes an appealing target for therapeutic intervention. Because the sugar content of glycoproteins is critical for the effective replication of the virus, viral protein glycosylation plays an important role in the course of virus infection, replication and virus -host interactions. 6 -8 Compounds that specifically bind to or alter carbohydrate structures on these exterior glycoproteins were recently evaluated for their properties as antiviral agents. 9, 10 It has been demonstrated that a variety of carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) attach to N-glycosylated molecules and possess antiviral activity. 11, 12 Moreover, it seems that the genetic barrier to evade CBA inhibition by altering the N-glycosylation pattern on viral envelope glycoproteins is high, hence resistance to many CBA is not easily acquired. 13 -16 An interesting group of CBA are the plant lectins. 17 Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) and Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA) are tetrameric a(1,3) and/or a(1,6) mannosebinding proteins that were previously found to be active towards human, simian and feline retroviruses, cytomegalovirus 9, 18, 19 and members of the Nidovirales order. 20 Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) 13, 18 is an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-binding lectin which also displayed pronounced antiviral properties. Derived from the stinging nettle root, it is among the smallest monomeric plant lectins known. 21 Mannose-binding lectins derived from prokaryotic origin, such as cyanovirin N (CV-N) or pradimicin A (PRM-A), are currently under investigation for their retro-, and SARS-coronavirus inhibiting properties. 11,12,22 -24 PRM-A is an actinomycete (Actinomadura hibisca)-derived D-mannose-binding agent 25 described as a 'lectin-mimic antibiotic'. 26 It was shown to be active against fungi, yeast, 25 HIV-1 27, 28 and several viruses from the Nidovirales order. 20 Strikingly, PRM-A demonstrated antiviral activity against serotype I but not serotype II feline coronaviruses (FCoV). 20 The exact PRM-A tropism is currently not known, but it is suggested that a(1,2)-mannose configurations on the N-glycans are important for recognition by PRM-A. 29 Coronaviruses are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses that invariably contain at least four structural proteins: the membrane (M), envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein wraps the genomic RNA into a nucleocapsid and is not exposed on the outside of the virus particle. The S, M and E proteins, of which the former two are glycosylated, are anchored in the envelope. The M protein, which contains a short ectodomain, is the most abundant envelope glycoprotein, and usually contains one glycan tree. The heavily glycosylated S protein, which mediates virus -cell attachment and fusion, forms large trimers that protrude from the virion surface. Two different coronaviruses were used to study the mode of action of CBA. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79-1146 causes a progressive systemic infection in cats. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 induces neuropathy and liver inflammation in mice. The interaction of CBA with the different virus envelope glycoproteins was evaluated. Furthermore, it was determined which step of the virus entry process was affected by the CBA. Finally, the influence of glycan maturation and cell-type specificity of glycosylation on inhibition by CBA was assessed. The results facilitate future research on coronavirus glycosylation and anti-coronavirus therapy.",

The fusion process can start at an incubation temperature of 378C. When cells and virus were inoculated at 48C and subsequently incubated at 378C (\u00fe/\u00fe), both steps in the presence of antiviral compounds, the number of MHV-EFLM infected cells (expressed as RLU) significantly reduced ( Figure 2 ). The presence of CBA during the fusion but not the attachment stage only reduced the infection when UDA and PRM-A were used. The presence of HHA, UDA or PRM-A only during the binding stage (\u00fe/ -) did not inhibit but surprisingly enhanced MHV-EFLM infection, an effect most pronounced for UDA. Similar procedures performed with GNA (\u00fe/ -) led in some but not all cases to a slight enhancement of infection (not shown).

This protein is N-glycosylated for most coronaviruses including infectious bronchitis virus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and FIPV. 42 -44 The MHV A59 46 We studied the influence of M protein glycosylation on the antiviral effect of CBA using MHV recombinants. These recombinants contained either N-, or O-linked sugars or no sugars at all at the MHV M ectodomain. 33 A higher antiviral activity of the compounds was detected against viruses containing M protein that is N-glycosylated. Thus, besides the S protein, the M protein may also be a target for CBA.",

            "text": "The CBA inhibitory activity against HIV mainly results from intervention of the CBA in the viral fusion process, 18,19 rather than with gp120 attachment to the HIV receptor. Similar results were obtained for MHV, as virus attachment was not inhibited by all CBA tested. PRM-A and UDA were able to efficiently block virus entry when added at a post-binding step. The inhibitory activity of HHA and GNA however, only became apparent when these agents were present during the entire entry process. This result may be explained by the difference in size between the CBA. While HHA and GNA are 50 kDa in size, PRM-A and UDA are much smaller (0.83 and 8.5 kDa, respectively). We speculate that the large CBA must bind to the S protein prior to the interaction of the S protein with the receptor. Strikingly, an enhancement of virus infection was noticed when some CBA were present during the attachment phase only. This surprising result might be explained by a tethering effect of CBA, which might facilitate virus -cell attachment and subsequently productive infection. 47 Indeed, the CBA evaluated in this study are able to bind multiple carbohydrate moieties. 11, 12 The role of host cells in determining the sensitivity to CBA was underscored by the observed altered sensitivity of genetically identical viruses, which were propagated on different cell lines. Since glycans on virus envelope proteins are synthesized by the host cell glycosylation machinery, 8 these results indicate that cell-specific glycosylation may influence the ability of CBA, in this case PRM-A, to inhibit virus infection.",

            "text": "The influence of host cell-specific glycosylation was also demonstrated when viruses were grown on natural host cells in which the glycan maturation was interfered with by dMM. The addition of dMM leads to inhibition of the Golgi enzymes mannosidase I and II which remove mannose residues from (viral) glycoproteins. As a consequence, the viral glycoproteins contain immature N-glycans of the high mannose type. 48 This resulted in a much higher sensitivity of the viruses for the CBA tested. Apparently, the mannose content of the N-glycan trees determines the CBA efficacy. It should be noted that also the antiviral activity of UDA increased towards viruses carrying high mannose glycans. At a first glance, this might suggest that UDA possesses both a GlcNAc and mannose tropism. Alternatively, UDA has been shown to bind more efficiently to GlcNAc in the presence of high amounts of mannose residues. 21 More detailed insight in the mode of action of CBA is imperative in the further development of antiviral therapeutic approaches using these agents. The use of CBA as microbicides to prevent HIV infection in vivo has already been proposed. 49 As coronaviruses induce diseases with a more acute onset and exploit different infection routes, the external (topical) application of these agents in order to prevent a coronavirus infection will be less appropriate. Systemic application of CBA seems required in order for CBA to function as anti-coronaviral agents. Our next goal will therefore be the establishment of a safe and systemic applicable form together with an optimized dosage regimen to impede coronavirus infections.",

Pedersen, Davis, CA, USA) were used for experiments with, and propagation of, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV strain 79-1146) and FIPV-D3abcFL. FIPV 79-1146 is a serotype II feline coronavirus. FIPV-D3abcFL contains a firefly luciferase gene in a FIPV 79-1146 background. 30,31 Mouse LR7 cells, an L-2 murine fibroblast cell line stably expressing the murine hepatitis virus receptor 32 , were used for the experiments with, and propagation of, MHV (strain A59) and the M gene MHV mutants Alb138, Alb244, Alb248 and MHV-EFLM. M gene MHV mutants designated Alb138, Alb244, Alb248 contained, respectively, an O-glycosylated, a N-glycosylated or an unglycosylated M protein at the aminoterminal ectodomain. 33 The Alb138 O-glycosylated mutant is biologically identical to MHV A59. MHV-EFLM contains a firefly luciferase gene in a MHV A59 background. 30,31 All mentioned cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 mg/L streptomycin. Titrations and tests were performed on the same medium containing only 5% FBS. MHV-EFLM HeLa is an MHV-EFLM strain propagated on HeLa cells stably expressing murine carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) (M. H. Verheije, unpublished data). For the production of FIPV-D3abcFL HeLa HeLa cells stably expressing the feline coronavirus receptor, feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) was used. 34 Both cell lines were maintained on DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/L streptomycin and 0.5 mg/mL G418 (Life Technologies, Ltd, Paisley, UK).",

The obtained Alb248 (O2N\u00fe) EC 50 values were significantly different (P , 0.01) from the Alb244 (O2N2) EC 50 values (EC 50 2.8-4.1 mg/L). The CBA EC 50 values of Alb138 (O\u00feN2) (EC 50 1.8-2.7 mg/ L) did not differ from the EC 50 values obtained for Alb244 (P . 0.05). Based on these results, the N-glycosylation site in the M glycoprotein can be regarded as a target for CBA.

This gain in antiviral activity of CBA to virus derived from dMM-treated compared with non-dMM-treated (WT) cells was represented in the EC 50 and EC 90 values (Figure 3). Our results indicate that the CBA activity is determined by the amount of high-mannose-type glycans present on the viral glycoproteins.Effect of pradimicin A on FIPV-D3abcFL and MHV-EFLM depends on the nature of the host cell Differences between FIPV and MHV with respect to PRM-A sensitivity might be attributed to the different host cells used for virus propagation. To analyse this, FIPV-D3abcFL HeLa and MHV-EFLM HeLa were grown on HeLa cells expressing fAPN and mCEACAM1a, respectively. The antiviral activity of PRM-A was subsequently evaluated on the HeLa-derived viruses and compared with FCWF-or LR7 cell-derived virus strains.FCWF cell-derived FIPV-D3abcFL FCWF was, as expected, still refractory to PRM-A exposure but FIPV-D3abcFL HeLa increased in susceptibility towards PRM-A (EC 50 FIPV-D3abcFL HeLa : 4.8 mg/L; EC 50 FIPV-D3abcFL FCWF : .100 mg/L). Pradimicin A was also more effective towards MHV-EFLM HeLa compared with MHV-EFLM LR7 (EC 50 MHV-EFLM HeLa : 0.25 mg/L; EC 50 MHV-EFLM LR7 : 5.4 mg/L)",
