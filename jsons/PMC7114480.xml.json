The disease was first reported in England in 1971 (Oldham, 1972). It has since been reported in many areas worldwide. The first link between the disease and the PEDV was identified in 1977 (Pensaert and Bouck, 1978). The virus is an enveloped coronavirus with a positive-stranded RNA genome that encodes four major structural proteins; spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins. Although conventional inactivated and attenuated vaccines are widely used in some areas in China, such vaccines have some drawbacks such as recovery of virulence, spread of viruses, high cost and poor protection efficacy. Therefore, development of novel and effective vaccines is necessary for control of PED.",

A great number of studies have shown that eukaryotic expression plasmids can induce protective immune responses (Ding et al., 2005, Lillehoj et al., 2005, Li et al., 2011). It is well known that the S protein of coronavirus plays a crucial role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies and has been used in the preparation of effective vaccines (Gomez et al., 2000, Tuboly and Nagy, 2001). The N-terminal portion of the S protein of several coronaviruses has been shown to contain key antigenic sites responsible for eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses (Delmas et al., 1986, Gebauer et al., 1991). Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a cytokine that was first cloned in 1995 from livers of propionibacterium acnes-treated mice (Okamura et al., 1995). Functionally, IL-18 induces IFN-\u03b3 production, stimulates proliferation of activated T cells, and enhances activities of NK cells among other things (Muneta et al., 2000).",

The amplification profile for the full length S gene (primers P1/P2) was as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 2.5 min, 56.8 \u00b0C for 2.5 min, and 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. A final extension of 72 \u00b0C for 10 min was performed at the end of the cycling period. The amplification profile for PEDV-S1 gene (primers P1/P3) was the same as for the PEDV-S gene except that the annealing temperature was raised to 54.8 \u00b0C. Plasmid pUC18-(IL-18) containing the full-length swine interleukin 18 gene was used as template for PCR. The sense and antisense primers P4 (5\u2032-GGGGGGATCCATGTACTTTGGCAAGCTT) and P5 (5\u2032-CCCCGAATTCCTAGTTCTTGTTTTGAACA) included BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites (underlined), respectively.

All PCR products were purified, restriction enzyme digested and ligated into the similarly digested eukaryotic expression vector, pVAX1 (Invitrogen, USA).

For this reason, we evaluated synergistic effects between the PEDV-S1 and pIL-18 by means of DNA vaccination.

Cytotoxic T-cell activity was also validated indirectly by monitoring cell lysis through increased LDH levels resulting from damaged cells (Yokozawa et al., 2000). Elevated LDH levels were observed in all but control treatments where the highest activities occurred in pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) and pVAX1-(IL-18) immunized mice. Changes in the serum IgG levels in particular between 7 and 35 dpi clearly showed that the plasmid constructs induced effective humoral responses capable of neutralizing the virus and that this neutralizing effect was strongest for the full-length S protein. However, unexpectedly, pVAX1-(IL-18) functioned only in tandem with pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) to affect both proliferative and virus neutralizing responses but exerted no adjuvant effects.

            "text": "It is well accepted that following polarization, Th1 cells secret IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 that mediate cellular immune responses, and Th2 cells secret IL-4 and IL-10 that help facilitate humoral immune responses where IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels are inversely regulated. In the studies presented herein, the levels of IFN-\u03b3 were significantly elevated in all non-control treatment groups. Unexpectedly, the levels of IL-4 though low, were also elevated relative to controls in all treatment groups except animals given pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) which generated no IL4 response. The dual elevation of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 has been observed elsewhere in GI nematode-infected cattle (Canals et al., 1997) and in cattle infected with the bovine viral diarrhea virus (Waldvogel et al., 2000) or vaccinated against the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Miao et al., 2004). It is still unclear as to why such a deviation from the norm occurred here; however, some studies suggest that the level of infection and therefore the level of antigen presentation can affect Th1/Th2 profiles (Claerebout et al., 2005). These data in conjunction with virus neutralization studies suggest that IFN-\u03b3 does not play a major role in protection.",

In contrast to our work on TEGV (Ren et al., 2006), results presented here showed that the full-length S gene unilaterally induced a better immune response than the truncated form of the protein; however, this may result from poor protein folding or less than optimal presentation of the shortened form to the host immune system. Future studies will examine this phenomenon more closely while investigating additional cytokines that enhance antibody production rather than Th1 type cytokines before attempting to transfer this technology to studies in swine.",
