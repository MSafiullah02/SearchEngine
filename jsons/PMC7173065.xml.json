Specimens were transported to the laboratory within 1 h of collection and were entered into the study if adequate sample was available to test by all three methods. Since all DFA-negative samples could not be tested, only DFA-negative or inadequate samples (less than 25 respiratory epithelial cells) from inpatients were included. Samples were tested on receipt by DFA and Binax NOW. An aliquot was frozen in lysis buffer at \u221270 \u00b0C and batch tested within 2 weeks by RT-PCR.",

Binax results were read at 15 min according to manufacturer's instructions. Nucleic acids from 200 \u03bcL of sample were extracted using Nuclisens EasyMag (bioMerieux, Durham, NC). A multiplex one-step influenza A and B TaqMan RT-PCR assay was performed using previously published primers and probes (Ward et al., 2004), Universal Master Mix with UNG and Multiscribe (Applied Biosystems), 900 nM of each primer, 200 nM of each probe, and 5 \u03bcL of nucleic acid extract in a 50-\u03bcL reaction. The amplification protocol consisted of 48 \u00b0C for 30 min, one cycle for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 60 \u00b0C. A cycle threshold of <38 was considered a true positive. DFA-negative samples with a C\nT of \u226538 were re-extracted and tested in duplicate. If both replicates were positive, the sample was called positive. RT-PCR sensitivity was \u22640.01 TCID50/mL for both influenza A and B. RT-PCR was considered the reference standard. A subset of samples was monitored for inhibitors, and none were found.",

            "text": "In this study, RT-PCR for influenza A and B detected many additional positives not detected by Binax NOW, but only a small number of positives not detected by cytospin-DFA. While the accuracy of real-time RT-PCR should be of significant benefit to those hospitals using simple rapid influenza tests, it may have a more modest impact on hospitals with expertise in cytospin-DFA. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of influenza PCR, including highly multiplexed assays, on both patient outcomes and costs in the hospital setting.",
