These CARVs cause upper and/or lower respiratory tract disease (URTD and LRTD) after allo-HSCT, and these are associated with high morbidity and mortality 1, 2.

However, little is known about the epidemiology, prevalence, and clinical features of CoVs and HBoV in immunocompromised patients [3].",

For the study purpose, in late 2013 we implemented the medical information/education for recipients and caregivers explaining in detail about the risks of having RVIs in the context of immunosuppression. Specific information included a description of respiratory symptoms, which should be reported as soon as possible to the transplant team, and recommendations concerning the infectious prevention control measures for patients and healthcaregivers. A telephone number (on-call 24 hours) for emergent conditions was also provided. The current study cohort comprised all the consecutive allo-HSCT recipients with virologically documented RVIs diagnosed at the Hospital Clinic i Universitari in Valencia during the 30-month study period. All recipients with respiratory symptoms between December 23, 2013 and June 26, 2016 were prospectively screened for CARVs by real-time PCR. Clinical and biologic characteristics were prospectively recorded as reported in detail elsewhere [21]. Immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI) variables were recorded at the first clinical evaluation as previously described [22]. A detailed clinical assessment was also performed and prospectively recorded in our transplant database at the time the respiratory symptoms were noted. Clinical manifestations included rhinorrhea, cough, rales, wheezing, shortness of breath, dyspnea, sinusitis, otitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and fever (temperature > 38\u00b0C). We retrospectively analyzed the epidemiology of the CoV and HBoV detected. The local ethics committee approved the study, and all subjects gave their written informed consent before participating in the study.",

The Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay can detect adenoviruses; HBoV; CoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43; influenza A virus/H1N1, influenza A virus/H3N2, and other influenza A viruses (non-subtypifiable); influenza B virus; HMPV A and B; HPiV 1, 2, 3, and 4A-4B; RSV A-B; and enterovirus/rhinovirus (EvRh).",

Interestingly, although the number of allo-HSCTs remained stable over the study period (40 allo-HSCTs per year), we noticed an increase in number and frequency in CoV detections, and CARVs in general, over the years the study was conducted. We only diagnosed 15% of the total number of CoV RVIs during 2014 (representing 7% of all RVIs that year), whereas during 2015 and the first half of 2016 the number and frequency increased to 41% and 44% of CoV RVI episodes and 11% and 29% of the total RVI episodes, respectively. These observations merit attention. First, it is likely that there was a learning curve in efficiently identifying recipients with respiratory symptoms and asking for the appropriate screening tests. The entire hematology team, including fellows, were involved in this project and became progressively more aware of the importance of monitoring viral infections in allo-HSCT recipients, especially during out-of-hours periods (nights and weekends). This fact could partly explain the significant difference in the rate of documented CARV RVIs in 2014 (n = 55; number of RVIs per month, 4) compared with 8 and 7 of RVI episodes per month in 2015 (n = 96) and the first 6 months of 2016 (n = 41; P < .01), respectively. Although this fact could be regarded as a limitation, it likely occurs in several sites when novel strategies/protocols are implemented. Second, although the study period did not extend over 3 complete respiratory virus seasons, we cannot rule out the possibility that the seasonal changes commonly seen in the prevalence of CARVs may have influenced the different CoV RVI rates observed in 2014, 2015, and the first half of 2016. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility of a peak in the prevalence of CoV RVIs in our community in 2016.",

This raises interesting questions concerning the role of co-pathogenesis in disease in allo-HSCT recipients. The high frequency of co-infections in this series makes it difficult to interpret the clinical significance of CoVs on their own because the clinical effects cannot be attributed to their presence alone. The limited number of cases of viral co-infections reported in the medical literature limits our knowledge of the clinical relevance of such co-infections in the allo-HSCT setting. Thus, analysis of the putative clinical effect of CoVs detected as co-pathogens compared with RVIs caused by a single viral agent would be a useful line of future investigation.",

However, our data indicate that at least 14% of CoV RVIs progressed to proven LRTDs, reaching 33% when possible LRTDs were considered. Again, it remains unknown if the presence of co-pathogens favors CoV progression to LRTD. Additionally, CoV RVIs led to hospital admissions because of fever, dyspnea, and/or clinical instability in 19% of cases. This suggests that CoV RVIs could be moderate to severe in allo-HSCT recipients and that additional supportive care is a common requirement. In relation to this, 1 of our study patients (representing 5% of the total CoV cases) with a possible LRTD and a high ISI died from respiratory failure soon after transplant, and his or her only microbiologic documentation at any site sampled was a CoV type OC43 in a nasal swab, 5 days before death. These findings are in line with a recent retrospective study where the presence of CoV in BAL samples in immunocompromised hosts was significantly associated with high rates of respiratory support and mortality, similar to that of established respiratory pathogens including RSV, influenza virus, and HPiV [28].",

This order agrees with epidemiologic data for infants and adults from several other countries and continents 29, 30 and may be valuable for vaccine development purposes. Some authors suggest that this order might be the consequence of the generation of cross-reacting antibodies after CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 infections that may protect against HHCoV-HKU1 and HHCoV-229E infections, respectively. However, this protective relationship may not be reciprocal [30]. Interestingly, the 2 most common CoV types (OC43 and NL63) showed more clinically ntense features, as reflected higher occurrence of fever, co-pathogens, hospitalization rates, LRTDs, and C-reactive protein. How these facts might relate to patient immunogenicity and epidemiology is intriguing and merits further study.",

Similar to many other reports that observed significant HBoV co-pathogenesis 16, 31, we found that 83% of positive HBoV samples tested positive for other co-pathogens. Again, this is very difficult to interpret given the scarce clinical evidence for the pathogenesis of HBoV alone in allo-HSCT recipients. A recent case-control study shown similar rates of HBoV genomic DNA detection in symptomatic (10.4%) and asymptomatic children (7.5%), suggesting that its detection did not imply necessarily pathogenicity in the respiratory tract by itself. This study found that HBoV capsid mRNA detection could differentiate acute infections from prolonged shedding [32]. Still, in our series HBoV detection was a rare phenomenon, representing 3% of all CARVs. This finding agreed with preliminary allo-HSCT data where the cumulative incidence of HBoV detection in the first 100 days was 2.1% [33].",
