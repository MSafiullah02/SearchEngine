A mechanistic understanding of 25 the impact of bats' virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, 26 on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence.

Best fit 29 models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting 30 robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral 31 propagation rates.

We evaluated our theoretical model analytically independent of the data, then 95 fit the model to data recovered from in vitro experimental trials in order to estimate rates of 96 within-host virus transmission and cellular progression to antiviral status under diverse 97 assumptions of absent, induced, and constitutive immunity. Finally, we confirmed our findings in 98 spatially-explicit stochastic simulations of fitted time series from our mean field model. We 99 hypothesized that top-down immune processes would overrule classical resource-limitation in 100 bat cell lines described as constitutively antiviral in the literature, offering a testable prediction 101 for models fit to empirical data. We further predicted that the most robust antiviral responses 102 would be associated with the most rapid within-host virus propagation rates but also protect cells 103 against virus-induced mortality to support the longest enduring infections in tissue culture. 104 105 Results 106 Virus infection experiments in antiviral bat cell cultures yield reduced cell mortality and 107 elongated epidemics. 108 We first explored the influence of innate immune phenotype on within-host viral 109 propagation in a series of infection experiments in cell culture.

Typically, 62 the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will induce secretion of 63 type I interferon proteins (IFN-a and IFN-b), which promote expression and translation of 64 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells and render them effectively antiviral 65 (Stetson and Medzhitov 2006) . In some bat cells, the transcriptomic blueprints for this IFN 66 response are expressed constitutively, even in the absence of stimulation by viral RNA or DNA 67 (Zhou et al. 2016 ). In non-flying mammals, constitutive IFN expression would likely elicit 68 widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection, but bats 69 support unique adaptations to combat inflammation (Zhang et The field of 'virus dynamics' was first developed to describe the mechanistic 80 underpinnings of long-term patterns of steady-state viral load exhibited by patients in chronic 81 phase infections with HIV, who appeared to produce and clear virus at equivalent rates (Nowak 82 and May 2000; Ho et al. 1995) . Models of simple target cell depletion, in which viral load is 83 dictated by a bottom-up resource supply of infection-susceptible host cells, were first developed 84 for HIV (Perelson 2002) but have since been applied to other chronic infections, including 85 hepatitis-C virus (Neumann et al. 1998 ), hepatitis-B virus (Nowak et al. 1996) and 86 cytomegalovirus (Emery et al. 1999 ). Recent work has adopted similar techniques to model the 87 within-host dynamics of acute infections, such as influenza A and measles, inspiring debate over 88 the extent to which explicit modeling of top-down immune control can improve inference 89 beyond the basic resource limitation assumptions of the target cell model (Baccam et al. 2006 ; shown in SI Appendix, Figure S6 ",

The compartmental within-host system mimicked our two-dimensional cell culture 172 monolayer, with cells occupying five distinct infection states: susceptible (S), antiviral (A), 173 exposed (E), infectious (I), and dead (D). We modeled exposed cells as infected but not yet 174 infectious, capturing the 'eclipse phase' of viral integration into a host cell which precedes viral 175 replication. Antiviral cells were immune to viral infection, in accordance with the \"antiviral 176 state\" induced from interferon stimulation of ISGs in tissues adjacent to infection (Stetson and 177 Medzhitov 2006) . Because we aimed to translate available data into modeled processes, we did 178 not explicitly model interferon dynamics but instead scaled the rate of cell progression from 179 susceptible to antiviral (r) by the proportion of exposed cells (globally) in the system. In systems 180 permitting constitutive immunity, a second rate of cellular acquisition of antiviral status ( ) 181 additionally scaled with the global proportion of susceptible cells in the model. Compared with 182 virus, IFN particles are small and highly diffusive, justifying this global signaling assumption at 183 the limited spatial extent of a six well plate and maintaining consistency with previous modeling 184 approximations of IFN signaling in plaque assay (Howat et al. 2006) . 185",

Next, each image frame 724 was walked through a series of secondary thresholding steps using if-else statements in R, such 725 that the lightness threshold for \"infectious\" status was elevated in frames which were lighter 726 overall due to manual variation in imaging and focusing. Processed subframes were then 727 reconstructed into composite binary images, which were manually checked against original 728 images to ensure consistent and reliable results.

Baseline 750 cell counts were also different across our three cell lines, which varied substantially in natural 751 size. To correct for this variation, we opted to model the proportion of infectious cell spaces per 752 hour for each well, rather than rely on the raw count data. To this end, we collected the 753 maximum number of live cells counted in susceptible control wells at timepoint 0 and set this 754 count to a rough measure of 100% well occupancy for the cell line in question. Using this 755 method, maximum cell counts were, respectively, 103712, 82308, and 92233 for Vero, RoNi/7.1, 756 and PaKiT01 cell lines, reflecting innate variation in cell sizes.

As such, we fixed b at .025 and estimated \u00b5 by fitting an infection-absent version of 802 our mean field model to the susceptible time series derived via Hoechst staining of control wells 803 for each of the three cell lines (SI Appendix, Figure S11 ). This yielded a natural mortality rate, \u00b5, 804 corresponding to a lifespan of approximately 121, 191, and 84 hours, respectively, for Vero, 805 RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 cell lines (SI Appendix, Figure S11 ). We then fixed the virus incubation 806 rate, s, as the inverse of the shortest observed duration of time from initial infection to the 807 observation of the first infectious cells via fluorescent microscope for all nine cell line -virus 808 combinations (ranging 6 to 9.5 hours). We fixed a, the infection-induced mortality rate, at Figure S4 -815 S5). Fitting was performed by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the 816 deterministic model output and cell line-virus-MOI-specific infectious proportion of the data at 817 each timestep. We optimized parameters for MOI = 0.001 and 0.0001 simultaneously to leverage 818 statistical power across the two datasets, estimating a different transmission rate, b, for trials run 819 at each infectious dose but, where applicable, estimating the same rates of r and e across the two 820 time series. We used the differential equation solver lsoda() in the R package deSolve (Soetaert, 821 Petzoldt, and Setzer 2010) to obtain numerical solutions for the mean field model and carried out 822 minimization using the 'Nelder-Mead' algorithm of the optim() function in base R. All model 823 fits were conducted using consistent starting guesses for the parameters, b (b= 3), and where 824 applicable, r (r = 0.001) and e (e = 0.001). In the case of failed fits or indefinite hessians, we 825 generated a series of random guesses around the starting conditions and continued estimation 826 until successful fits were achieved. 827 (2006), we modeled this system on a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, using a ten-minute 844 epidemic timestep for cell state transitions. At the initialization of each simulation, we randomly 845 assigned a duration of natural lifespan, incubation period, infectivity period, and time from 846 antiviral to susceptible status to all cells in a theoretical monolayer. Parameter durations were 847 drawn from a normal distribution centered at the inverse of the respective fixed rates of \u00b5, s, a, 848 and c, as reported with our mean field model. These durations were updated iteratively with each 849 time-step, based on each cell's epidemic status. We fixed the parameters for antiviral acquisition 850 (e and r) at those values estimated in the mean field model, and to compensate for a higher virus 851 invasion threshold under spatial conditions, we fixed the birth rate b and the cell-to-cell 852 transmission rate, b, at ten times the values recovered from optimization of the mean field model 853 (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). 854",

The extent to which constitutive IFN-a expression signifies 72 constitutive antiviral defense in the form of functional IFN-a protein remains unresolved. In bat 73 cells constitutively expressing IFN-a, some protein-stimulated, downstream ISGs appear to be 74 also constitutively expressed, but additional ISG induction is nonetheless possible following viral 75 challenge and stimulation of IFN-b (Zhou et al. 2016; Xie et al. 2018).

To intensify cell 116 line-specific differences in constitutive immunity, we carried out infectivity assays with GFP-117 tagged, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis Indiana viruses: rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, and 118 rVSV-MARV, which have been previously described (Miller et al. 2012; Wong et al. 2010). 119 Two of these viruses, rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV, are recombinants for which cell entry is 120 mediated by the glycoprotein of the bat-evolved filoviruses, Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg 121 (MARV), thus allowing us to modulate the extent of structural, as well as immunological, 122 antiviral defense at play in each infection. Previous work in this lab has demonstrated 123 incompatibilities in the NPC1 filovirus receptor which render PaKiT01 cells refractory to 124 infection with rVSV-MARV (Ng and Chandran 2018), making them structurally antiviral, over 125 and above their constitutive expression of IFN-a. All three cell lines were challenged with all 126 three viruses at two multiplicities of infection (MOI): 0.001 and 0.0001. Between 18-39 trials 127 were run at each cell-virus-MOI combination, excepting rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 128 cells at MOI=0.001, for which only 8 trials were run (see Materials and Methods; SI Appendix, S3, Dataset S1). 130 Because plaque assays restrict viral transmission neighbor-to-neighbor in two-131 dimensional cellular space (Howat et al. 2006), we were able to track the spread of GFP-132 expressing virus-infected cells across tissue monolayers via inverted fluorescence microscopy. 133 For each infection trial, we monitored and re-imaged plates for up to 200 hours of observations 134 or until total monolayer destruction, processed resulting images, and generated a time series of 135 the proportion of infectious-cell occupied plate space across the duration of each trial (see 136 Materials and Methods). We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell 137 culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic 138 transmission model for each cell line-virus-specific combination (Fitted time series of infectious cell proportions from mean field model for rVSV-G, 142 rVSV-EBOV, and rVSV-MARV infections (columns) on Vero, RoNi/7.",

Epidemics were less severe in bat cell cultures, especially when infected with the 158 recombinant filoviruses, rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV. Monolayer destruction was avoided in 159 the case of rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells: in the former, persistent 160 viral infection was maintained throughout the 200-hour duration of each experiment, while, in 161 the latter, infection was eliminated early in the time series, preserving a large proportion of live, 162 uninfectious cells across the duration of the experiment. We assumed this pattern to be the result 163 of immune-mediated epidemic extinction (Figure 1).

These findings suggest that antiviral immune responses protect host tissues against 416 virus-induced cell mortality to permit the establishment of more rapid within-host transmission 417 rates. 418 Total monolayer destruction occurred in all cell-virus combinations excepting rVSV-419 EBOV infections on RoNi/7.1 cells and rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 420 cells. Monolayer destruction corresponded to susceptible cell depletion and epidemic turnover 421 where R-effective (the product of A and the proportion susceptible) was reduced below one 422 (Figure 5). For rVSV-EBOV infections on RoNi/7.1, induced antiviral cells safeguarded remnant 423 live cells, which birthed new susceptible cells late in the time series. In rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-424 MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells, this antiviral protection halted the epidemic (Figure 5; R-425 effective <1) before susceptibles fully declined. In the case of rVSV-EBOV on PaKiT01, the 426 birth of new susceptibles from remnant live cells protected by antiviral status maintained late-427 stage transmission to facilitate long-term epidemic persistence. Importantly, under fixed 428 parameter values for the infection incubation rate (s) and infection-induced mortality rate (a), 429 models were unable to reproduce the longer-term infectious time series captured in data from 430 rVSV-EBOV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines without incorporation of cell births, an 431 assumption adopted in previous modeling representations of IFN-mediated viral dynamics in 432 tissue culture (Howat et al. 2006).

In spatial simulations, rates of antiviral 454 acquisition were fixed at fitted values for r and derived from mean field estimates, while 455 transmission rates (b) were fixed at values ten times greater than those estimated under mean 456 field conditions because spatial structure is known to intensify parameter thresholds permitting 457 pathogen invasion (Webb, Keeling and Boots, 2007; SI Appendix, Figure S10, Video S1-S3). In 458 immune capable time series, spatial antiviral cells acted as 'refugia' which protected live cells 459 from infection as each initial epidemic wave 'washed' across a cell monolayer. Eventual birth of 460 new susceptibles from these living refugia allowed for sustained epidemic transmission in cases 461 where some infectious cells persisted at later timepoints in simulation (SI Appendix, reservoirs for several important emerging zoonoses but appear not to experience 466 disease from otherwise virulent viral pathogens. Though the molecular biological literature has 467 made great progress in elucidating the mechanisms by which bats tolerate viral infections (Zhou 468 et al. 2016; Ahn et al. 2019; Xie et al. 2018; Pavlovich et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2013), the impact 469 of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics within-host has not been well-elucidated. We used an 470 innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and within-host modeling to explore the 471 impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics. Critically, we found that bat cell lines 472 demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either 473 constitutive or induced form, which allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell 474 virus transmission rates (b). These results were supported by both data-independent bifurcation 475 analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection 476 time series established in bat cell culture. Additionally, we demonstrated that the antiviral state 477 induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in 478 in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance that probability of establishing a long-term 479 persistent infection. Our findings suggest that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing 480 enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without 481 causing pathology to their hosts. Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme 482 virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats. 483 To achieve these results, we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model 484 elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the 485 model's equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions. We 486 considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral cells at 487 disease free equilibrium but allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the 488 parameter range for , the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition. In deriving the equation for 489 A , the basic reproduction number, which defines threshold conditions for virus invasion of a 490 tissue ( A > 1), we demonstrated how the invasion threshold is elevated at high values of 491 constitutive antiviral acquisition, . Constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen 492 invasion, while induced responses, by definition, can only control infections post-hoc. Once 493 thresholds for pathogen invasion have been met, assumptions of constitutive immunity will limit 494 the cellular mortality (virulence) incurred at high transmission rates. Regardless of mechanism 495 (induced or constitutive), interferon-stimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role in 496 maintaining longer term or persistent infections by safeguarding susceptible cells from rapid 497 infection and concomitant cell death. 498 Fitting of our model to in vitro data supported expected immune phenotypes for different 499 bat cell lines as described in the literature. Simple target cell models that ignore the effects of 500 immunity best recapitulated infectious time series derived from IFN-deficient Vero cells, while 501 models assuming induced immune processes most accurately reproduced trials derived from 502 RoNi/7.1 (Rousettus aegyptiacus) cells, which possesses a standard virus-induced IFN-response. 503 In most cases, models assuming constitutive immune processes best recreated virus epidemics 504 produced on PaKiT01 (Pteropus alecto) cells, which are known to constitutively express the 505 antiviral cytokine, IFN-a (Zhou et al. 2016). Model support for induced immune assumptions in 506 fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01cells suggests that the constitutive IFN-a expression 507 characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process 508 than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense. Results from mean field model fitting were 509 additionally confirmed in spatially explicit stochastic simulations of each time series. 510 As previously demonstrated in within-host models for HIV (Coffin 1995; Perelson et al. 511 1996; Nowak et al. 1995; Bonhoeffer et al. 1997; Ho et al. 1995), assumptions of simple target-512 cell depletion can often provide satisfactory approximations of viral dynamics, especially those 513 reproduced in simple in vitro systems. Critically, our model fitting emphasizes the need for 514 incorporation of top-down effects of immune control in order to accurately reproduce infectious 515 time series derived from bat cell tissue cultures, especially those resulting from the robustly 516 antiviral PaKiT01 P. alecto cell line. These findings indicate that enhanced IFN-mediated 517 immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates 518 prior to cross-species emergence. We nonetheless acknowledge the limitations imposed by in 519 vitro experiments in tissue culture, especially involving recombinant viruses and immortalized 520 cell lines. Future work should extend these cell culture studies to include measurements of 521 multiple state variables (i.e. antiviral cells) to enhance epidemiological inference. 522 The continued recurrence of Ebola epidemics across central Africa highlights the 523 importance of understanding bats' roles as reservoirs for virulent zoonotic disease. The past 524 decade has born witness to emerging consensus regarding the unique pathways by which bats 525 resist and tolerate highly virulent infections (Brook and Dobson 2015; Xie et al. 2018; Zhang et 526 al. 2013; Ahn et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2016; Ng et al. 2015; Pavlovich et al. 2018). Nonetheless, 527 an understanding of the mechanisms by which bats support endemic pathogens at the population 528 level, or promote the evolution of virulent pathogens at the individual level, remains elusive. 529 Endemic maintenance of infection is a defining characteristic of a pathogen reservoir (Haydon et 530 al. 2002), and bats appear to merit such a title, supporting long-term persistence of highly 531 transmissible viral infections in isolated island populations well below expected critical 532 community sizes (Peel et al. 2012). Researchers debate the relative influence of population-level 533 and within-host mechanisms which might explain these trends (Plowright et al. 2016), but 534 increasingly, field data are difficult to reconcile without acknowledgement of a role for persistent 535 infections (Peel et al. 2018; Brook et al. 2019).We present general methods to study cross-scale 536 viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral 537 responses characteristic of bat immune processes. Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates 538 under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen 539 emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats",

Viruses were selected to represent a 594 broad range of anticipated antiviral responses from host cells, based on a range of past 595 evolutionary histories between the virus glycoprotein mediating cell entry and the host cell's 596 entry receptor. These interactions ranged from the total absence of evolutionary history in the 597 case of rVSV-G infections on all cell lines to a known receptor-level cell entry incompatibility in 598 the case of rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines. 599 To measure infectivities of rVSVs on each of the cell lines outlined above, Phenotypes via qPCR of IFN Genes. 605 Previously published work indicates that immortalized kidney cell lines of Rousettus 606 aegyptiacus (RoNi/7.1) and Pteropus alecto (PaKiT01) exhibit different innate antiviral immune 607 phenotypes through, respectively, induced (Biesold et al. 2011; Pavlovich et al. 2018; K\u00fchl et al. 608 2011; Arnold et al. 2018) and constitutive (Zhou et al. 2016) expression of type I interferon 609 genes.

Low MOIs were selected to 658 best approximate the dynamics of mean field infection and limit artifacts of spatial structuring, 659 such as premature epidemic extinction when growing plaques collide with plate walls in cell 660 culture. 661 Six well plates were prepared with each infection in duplicate or triplicate, such that a 662 control well (no virus) and 2-3 wells each at MOI 0.001 and 0.0001 were incubated 663 simultaneously on the same plate.

From that time forward, 673 a square subset of the center of each well (comprised of either 64-or 36-subframes and 674 corresponding to roughly 60 and 40% of the entire well space) was imaged periodically, using a 675 CellInsight CX5 High Content Screening (HCS) Platform with a 4X air objective 676 (ThermoFisher, Inc., Waltham, MA). Microscope settings were held standard across all trials, 677 with exposure time fixed at 0.0006 sec for each image. One color channel was imaged, such that 678 images produced show GFP-expressing cells in white and non-GFP-expressing cells in black (SI 679 Appendix, Figure S1). 680 Wells were photographed in rotation, as frequently as possible, from the onset of GFP 681 expression until the time that the majority of cells in the well were surmised to be dead, GFP 682 expression could no longer be detected, or early termination was desired to permit Hoechst 683 staining. 684 In the case of PaKiT01 cells infected with rVSV-EBOV, where an apparently persistent 685 infection established, the assay was terminated after 200+ hours (8+ days) of continuous 686 observation. Upon termination of all trials, cells were fixed in formaldehyde (4% for 15 min), 687 incubated with Hoechst stain (0.0005% for 15 min) (ThermoFisher, Inc., Waltham, MA), then 688 imaged at 4X on the CellInsight CX5 High Content Screening (HCS) Platform.
