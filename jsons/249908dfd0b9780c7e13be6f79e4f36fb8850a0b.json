At baseline, S was assumed to be the population of Hubei Province (59.17 million) and Wuhan (11 million), respectively [8, 30] . The initial assumed numbers of cases caused by zoonotic exposure were 40 (I) in Wuhan according to Imai et al.'s estimation [4] and 60 (I) in Hubei Province calculated by the proportion of Wuhan infectious cases in Hubei Province from daily reported data released by NHC. We assumed E at 20 times of I in accordance with Read et al. [5] . Absence of fever in COVID-19 cases is more frequent than in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [31] . Such patients may be missed for diagnosis since the current surveillance case definition focused mainly on fever detection. Accordingly, the possibility of E at 30 times of I cannot be excluded. Therefore, we also explored the model with E at 30 times of I to provide a possible range of infections. R was set as 0. s was set as 1/5.2 according to the latest article by Li et al. [8] , which calculated the mean incubation period of COVID-19 to be 5.2 days. Chen et al. [32] calculated the average hospitalization period of 31 discharged patients to be 12.39 AE 4.77 days. Yang et al. calculated the median time from disease onset to diagnosis among confirmed patients to be 5 days [33] . g was accordingly set as 1/18 (ceiling of 12.39 + 5 is 18) [7] . R e was chosen by various phases. The first phase ranges from December 1, 2019 to January 23, 2020 and can be regarded as the early phase of the epidemic when a few prevention and control measures were implemented. R 0 was set as 3.1 consistent with Imai et al.'s estimation of high transmission level [4] .

February 2, 2020 was the last day of the extended Spring Festival holiday and more medical resources were mobilized to support Wuhan and Hubei Province ever since [34] . Two specialized hospitals which came into service to admit more infections, and mobile cabin hospitals, which were originally gymnasium, were in operation to admit cases with mild to moderate symptoms [18, 19] . In addition, more and more medical teams arrived in Wuhan and Hubei Province. Therefore, the third phase began on February 3, 2020 and R e was set as 1.9 according to Imai et al.'s estimation of low transmission level [4] . It might take the longest incubation period (about 14 days) for all these measures to take effect. Finally, the last phase began on February 16, 2020 and R e was set as 0.9, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively, assuming the prevention and control measures are sufficient and effective to depict three different levels of preventive measures in reducing transmission probability [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 322, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 323, "end": 326, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 453, "end": 456, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 662, "end": 665, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 760, "end": 764, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1150, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1237, "end": 1241, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1453, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1518, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1826, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2067, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2211, "end": 2214, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2380, "end": 2384, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2588, "end": 2592, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2593, "end": 2596, "text": "19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2817, "end": 2820, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3193, "end": 3196, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Estimation of the epidemic trend in both Hubei Province and Wuhan"}, {"text": "Next, we provided an estimation of the epidemic trend in regions outside Hubei Province in China, trying to fill the research gaps and depict the disease holistically.

However, in later phases, R e values in regions outside Hubei Province in China may decline faster than those of Hubei Province and Wuhan because of the following reasons. Compared with the epidemic focus regions, there were fewer infections in other regions in the early stage. The epidemic intensity of the disease was not so high as in Wuhan and Hubei. And the medical resources were relatively more sufficient. The daily number of newly-confirmed cases in regions outside Hubei Province in China has decreased since February 4, 2020. The number of newly-added recovered cases exceeded that of newly-confirmed cases while the number of existing confirmed cases has begun to decline since February 12, 2020.

Firstly, the SEIR model was based on a few essential assumptions (e.g., no multiple zoonotic sources of the virus, no infectivity during incubation period, and no super-spreaders), which lacked supportive evidence currently. Specifically, due to the inherent limitation of the SEIR model [25] , which assumes diseases spread evenly across homogeneous population, the number of cases in the current study might be underestimated constrained by the possible existence of super-spreaders and asymptomatic infectors. We could do essential modification to the estimation model in future research. Secondly, the accuracy of the estimation model depends largely on the accuracy of the parameters it used (S, E, I, R, \u03b2, \u03c3, and \u03b3). Data lags might exist since the parameters (such as recovery period) were based on published literatures rather than real-time data. There are inevitable deviations between the prediction and reported data. The predicted data are relatively stable, while the reported data may be affected by many real-time human factors. For example, the currently not stringent enough standard for recovery (proven by the occurrence of those discharged but turned out to be not fully recovered) may make the reported peak falsely advanced. Despite the deviations, the epidemic trend estimated by SEIR model could provide theoretical reference for disease prevention and control. With more precise parameters obtained as the epidemic progresses and more published researches, our estimation model will also be more precise. We will further revise the model in the future research. Thirdly, since R e is a dynamic parameter, it would be hard to avoid bias in the model when using a fixed R e value in every single phase. Furthermore, the model involved so many parameters that the multi-sensitivity analysis would be very complex. For that reason, we only considered the relationship between number of people exposed to disease (E) and number of people infected (I), which we thought would impact the model mostly, and made two possible assumptions (i.e., E = 20I and E = 30I). SEIR model was also estimated with two initial data in regions outside Hubei Province. The number of infected people leaving Wuhan was calculated as 541 and 793 based on our predictive number in Wuhan under two different assumptions. They could be considered as equivalents to sensitivity analyses in some extent. Also, the model fit information should be supplemented once the data corresponding to actual situations are available in the future. With practical restriction, we regarded regions outside Hubei Province in China as a whole mainly because the big differences among regions outside Hubei Province are not as significant as those between Hubei Province and other regions, and it is uncertain to predict the epidemic trend for every province and city separately with uncertain essential parameters. Lastly, the SEIR model in the current study is usually used to estimate the epidemic in a closed crowd. The relatively large population flowing in regions outside Hubei Province in China may make the application of the model not as reasonable as in Wuhan and Hubei Province. Due to the inconstant domestic population migration and the increasing potential cases imported from abroad in the coming weeks, it is hard to make accurate epidemic forecast in the SEIR model, especially for the possible second outbreak.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 332, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Despite the limitations mentioned above, this study was the first phase-and region-adjusted estimation of the epidemic trend in strict-controlled Hubei Province and regions outside Hubei in China based on the latest data.
