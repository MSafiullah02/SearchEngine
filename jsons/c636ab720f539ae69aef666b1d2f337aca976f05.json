These peculiar structures are key elements of RUB factories, where rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi are recruited. Bicistronic RUB replicons expressing an antibiotic resistance gene either in the presence or the absence of the RUB capsid (C) gene were used to study the structure of RCs in transfected cells. Confocal microscopy showed that the RUB replicase components P90 and P150 localized to CPVs, as did double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a marker for RNA synthesis. Electron microscopy (EM) showed that replicons generated CPVs containing small vesicles and large vacuoles, similar to CPVs from RUB-infected cells and that the replicase proteins were sufficient for organelle recruitment. Some of these CPVs contained straight membranes. When cross-sectioned, these rigid membranes appeared to be sheets of closely packed proteins. Immuno-EM revealed that these sheets, apparently in contact with the cytosol, contained both P150 and P90, as well as dsRNA, and thus could be two-dimensional arrays of functional viral replicases. Labelling of dsRNA after streptolysin-O permeabilization showed that replication of viral genome takes place on the cytoplasmic side of CPVs. When present, C accumulated around CPVs. Mitochondrial protein P32 was detected within modified CPVs, the first demonstration of involvement of this protein, which interacts with C, with RCs. Fig. 5 .

Mitochondria, cytoskeletal elements and cellular endomembranes are frequent participants in the factory architecture. Knowledge about the signals involved in organelle recruitment and modification, as well as mechanisms operating in spatial connection between viral replication and morphogenesis, is very limited. One of the earliest events in the construction of the factory is the formation of the replication complexes (RCs). In this sense, the replication of viral genomes in association with intracellular membranes is a common feature of many viruses, particularly of positive-stranded RNA viruses (Salonen et al., 2005) . A variety of membranes are used by different viruses, including membranes of secretory pathway organelles (picorna-, arteri-, bromo-and flaviviruses) (Schlegel et al., 1996; van der Meer et al., 1998; Mackenzie et al., 1999; Suhy et al., 2000; Dubuisson et al., 2002; Westaway et al., 2002) , mitochondria (nodaviruses) (Miller et al., 2001) , peroxisomes and chloroplasts (tombusviruses) (Rochon, 1999) , endosomes and lysosomes (togaviruses) (Froshauer et al., 1988; Lee et al., 1994; Magliano et al., 1998; Kujala et al., 2001) and autophagosomes (arteriviruses, coronaviruses, poliovirus and rhinovirus) (reviewed by Wileman, 2006 ).

CPVs contain internalized, membrane-bound spherules of 50-70 nm which are thought to be the sites of viral RNA synthesis. In some electron micrographs, these spherules appear to be connected with the organelle membrane by slender threads or 'necks'. It is probably through these necks that newly synthesized RNA is transported to the cytoplasm.

Two views of CPVs in RUBrep/C-GFP/neo stably transfected cells are shown in Fig. 4A and B which likely represent a cross-section and a side view respectively. The CPV in Fig. 4A is electron-dense and contains a number of hollow vacuoles while the CPVs in Fig. 4B are characterized by a large vacuole and a long straight element. CPVs in RUBrep/GFP/neo stably transfected cells had a similar morphology (not shown). As a control for the replicontransfected cells, uninfected and RUB-infected BHK-21 cells (24 and 48 h post infection) were similarly analysed ( Fig. 4C and D). Lysosomes in uninfected cells (inset in Fig. 4D ) were electron-dense with some small vesicles occasionally distinguishable (but at a much lower number than in CPVs in replicon-transfected cells) and usually devoid of vacuoles and straight elements and without local recruitment of mitochondria and RER (not shown). However, RUB-infected cells ( Fig. 4C and D) contained electron-dense CPVs with internal vacuoles and straight elements, although these were usually smaller and in lower abundance than in replicon stably transfected cells. Immunogold labelling with antibodies against P150 and P90 replicase components (Fig. 5 ) demonstrated the presence of both proteins in CPVs, which were also labelled by anti-lysosome antibodies (not shown). Thus, these CPVs contain RUB replicon RCs. Both P150 and P90 were associated with both vacuoles and straight elements in the CPVs. Side views of CPVs suggest that straight elements and their replicase proteins are in contact with the cytoplasm ( Fig. 5B and C). To study if RNA replication takes place on the cytosolic or on the lumenal side of the CPVs, transfected cells were treated with streptolysin-O (SLO) to open pores in the plasma membrane without altering intracellular membranes before immunolabelling with anti-dsRNA antibodies ( Fig. 5E -G). Saponin, which permeabilizes all endomembranes, was used in some of the samples as a control. Labelling of the cytosolic domain of TGN38 and the mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp-60 (not shown) served as controls for the permeabilization procedures and confirmed the topological interpretation of dsRNA localization. After saponin treatment an intense signal associated to dsRNA is observed as shown in Fig. 5D . After SLO treatment and immunolabelling before fixation, similar dsRNA signals were obtained but only in permeabilized cells, where free cytosolic GFP has been released ( Fig. 5F and G).

It is thought that these complex structures are built by viruses to concentrate key components and increase the efficiency of replication and assembly of new viral particles (Novoa et al., 2005b; Wileman, 2006) . Modified organelles that are specifically labelled for lysosomal markers are the central elements of RUB factories, and RER cisternae, mitochondria and Golgi stacks are among the recruited cellular factors. The architecture of the RCs inside the modified lysosome or CPV and the mechanism of transfer of replicated genomes to the assembly sites in Golgi membranes remain to be elucidated. Towards this end, in this study we investigated RCs in cells transfected with RUB replicons. With replicons, the contribution of the structural proteins can be dissected from the non-structural replicase proteins. Additionally, as the replicons used expressed a GFP reporter gene and an antibiotic resistance gene, transfected cells could be readily identified and drug selection could be used to select a population of cells that uniformly harboured the replicon. We found CPVs in replicon-transfected cells that were modified lysosomes similar in structure to those found in RUBinfected cells, although they were present in greater abundance and appeared to have a more developed internal architecture of vacuoles and membrane-bound straight elements. These elements were also present in a small percentage of lysosomes in control cells and thus the generation of these structures in CPVs may be a normal process stimulated by virus/replicon replication. Interestingly, viral replicase proteins reach the same intracellular location during infection and transfection.

Similar observations have been made in RUB-infected cells (reviewed in Lee and Bowden, 2000) . As lysosome modification to generate CPVs and organelle recruitment was observed with replicons lacking the C protein, the non-structural replicase proteins by themselves can carry out these functions. Although local organelle recruitment was observed, global organelle recruitment in replicontransfected cells was not, independently of whether the replicon expressed the C protein or not. Beatch et al. (2005) recently reported a global recruitment of mitochondria to perinuclear regions in cells expressing the RUB C protein. However, as such a global recruitment is not observed in RUB replicon-transfected cells, this observation appears to be specific for expression of the C protein alone. Although expression of the C protein by replicons was not necessary for generation of CPVs, in cells transfected with replicons expressing the C protein, colocalization of the C protein with P150 and P90 was detected and the C protein accumulated on the exterior of CPVs. Small amounts of C were also detected inside CPVs. Confocal microscopy suggested that C covered the exterior of some modified lysosomes. The replicon expressed C protein is actually a fusion protein with GFP and we cannot rule out a different behaviour of C-GFP when compared with C alone. However, C-GFP fusions are functional in modulation of replicon RNA synthesis and mutant rescue (Tzeng and Frey, 2003; 2005) and Lee et al. (1999) detected C protein around CPVs by immuno-EM of RUB-infected cells (Lee et al., 1999) . With regard to C-mediated enhancement and modulation of replicon RNA synthesis and mutant rescue, it was recently found that P150 and C can be co-immunoprecipitated (Tzeng et al., 2006) and our finding of colocalization of C, P150 and P90 further confirms an interaction, which may play a role in these C-mediated phenomena.

Kujala et al. (1999) also observed the colocalization of P150 with actin and a considerable disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in RUB-infected cells. It is known that viruses frequently use actin filaments for intracellular transport while some viruses disrupt the actin cytoskeleton to facilitate infection (Cudmore et al., 1997; Dohner and Sodeik, 2005) . Actin could also be a structural component of herpesviruses (Gr\u00fcnewald et al., 2003) and the participation of actin in organizing the sites of mRNA accumulation and synthesis of viral structural proteins has been reported for HIV (Kimura et al., 1996) . The potential role of actin in RUB replication remains to be established. We also detected small amounts of the mitochondrial P32 protein in modified lysosomes and, conversely, C located on the exterior surface of mitochondria. The association of C and P32 was reported by two groups (Beatch and Hobman, 2000; Mohan et al., 2002) and Beatch and Hobman (2000) demonstrated that C and P32 interacted on the periphery of mitochondria in transfected cells expressing C protein. The function of this interaction in RUB replication has not been elucidated although Beatch et al. (2005) recently reported that mutations in the C protein that disrupt the interaction adversely affect virus infectivity. Our results confirm the localization of C to the exterior of mitochondria and are the first demonstration of P32 associated to RUB CPVs. We cannot discard that the presence of P32 inside CPVs could be due to autophagy. However, as P32 is able to leave the mitochondria (Matthews and Russell, 1998; Brokstad et al., 2001) its presence inside CPVs could have a different meaning. It has been proposed that RUB C could interact with P32 shortly before it is translocated into mitochondria or alternatively as it leaves it (Beatch et al., 2005) . On the other hand, our results indicate that C protein would not be necessary for P32 association with RUB RCs because P32 is detected in CPVs when cells are transfected with RUBrep/GFP/neo. These data suggest that P32 could be a structural component of the RUB RC and it is tempting to speculate that P32 could participate in directing C protein to the RC for packaging of the newly synthesized RNA before virus assembly. Further studies will be necessary to clarify these key aspects of RUB replication.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 129, "text": "Kujala et al.
