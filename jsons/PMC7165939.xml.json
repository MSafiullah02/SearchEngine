Patient notes and radiological images are geographically separated from the patient so that patient secretions which may contain virus particles cannot contaminate them.

The number of new cases of SARS is decreasing at the time of writing, and it is hoped that the provision of otorhinolaryngological services will gradually return to normal. In future planning of otorhinolaryngological services at the Prince of Wales Hospital, services will be designed specifically to minimize the risk of cross\u2010infections within the hospital setting. This may involve reducing the number of patients in wards to prevent crowding and reducing the number of appointments in clinics. The current infection control measures in the hospital and the triage system for outpatients are likely to remain in place because they have been effective. Infection of health care workers by patients with SARS has been due to lapses in the use of personal protective equipment rather than to the equipment itself. Protected treatment areas in the otorhinolaryngological wards and for outpatients, such as dedicated nasopharyngoscopy rooms, are planned. Guidelines are being drawn up for the use of nebulizers and ultrasonic humidifiers in the wards and for high\u2010risk otorhinolaryngological procedures such as rigid endoscopies and tracheostomies. There will be a growing emphasis placed on an otorhinolaryngological outpatient surgery service.",

The decrease in attendance at the outpatient clinic, which has remained open since the outbreak, has been due to patients defaulting on their appointments. Nonessential elective surgery has been suspended until further notice, accounting for the decrease in surgical procedures performed and partially accounting for the decrease in bed occupancy in the wards. The temporary closure of the emergency department also contributed to the decrease in ward admissions and emergency surgery. The provision of otorhinolaryngological services has been restructured, and further restructuring is necessary to minimize the risk of cross\u2010infections within the hospital setting. The changes will profoundly affect the day\u2010to\u2010day running of the outpatient clinic, wards, and operating theater.
