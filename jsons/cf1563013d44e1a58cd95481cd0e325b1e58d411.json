            "text": "Perhaps the most obvious way for students to draw the social studies is for them to draw factual historical episodes. The possibilities are literally endless, from ancient Rome, to revolutionary France to the Soviet Union. Chilcoat (1993) argues for the benefits of using the comic format in the social studies classroom, specifically by having students research historical information and create a comic from their research. Chilcoat (1993, 2) noted: \"The comic book allows students to take verbal-linear-analytical information from various primary and secondary sources and, through a visual-aesthetic-creative means, construct this information into personal interpretations and conclusions.\" The comic medium can also allow students to approach history like a historian. Students can construct a history, just like historians and understand the role of interpretation in this process (Banks, McGee-Banks, & Clegg, 1999; Getz & Clarke, 2011) .",

Students creating their own historical fiction in comic form can exploit this natural storytelling potential. The historical facts can be a starting point from which students can create their own interpretations. Narrative/story arcs could be introduced here as well (Abel & Madden, 2008; Potts, 2013) . Students could use historical details and facts to create a narrative with a protagonist and this protagonist would have to endure a series of events and trails to remedy some type of situation. Here, a healthy mix of historical accuracy and student creativity can be blended together to form a new unique creation. Professors and teachers could work with students to ensure a fruitful blend. Even if students are striving to create an accurate historical episode students may still have to decide on elements which they cannot know, such as what certain characters wore, their emotions, interior rooms, and the like (Getz & Clarke, 2011) . Asking these types of questions and deciding on historical details can be an excellent historical exercise for budding historians and teachers can work with students to highlight this process.",

Chilcoat (1993) also notes how the comic assignment can help students convey a sense of chronology. In regards to chronology, I urge my students to not only look at connections for specific events, but also for connections and sequences over longer stretches of time.

Cromer and Clark (2007, 583) , as noted earlier, argue that comics can also help students understand the \"messiness\" and complexity of historical events. Even when discussing power and oppression, social studies teachers cannot see oppression as a simple phenomenon (Kincheloe, 2001) . The causes of oppression are always varied and intersecting. We are not objective machines which can be studied like scientific objects. Of course, Kincheloe (2001) argues that this is precisely what happens. Since the time of Descartes and the Enlightenment, European rationalism has reduced human beings to machine-like entities (Kincheloe, 2001) . As a result, researchers try to diagnose and then fix the problem in a mechanistic way. But reality is not a linear phenomenon. Reality and human life are messy endeavors. Social studies teachers need to recognize this feature (Kincheloe, 2001) . While reading and creating a comic book will not magically alert the student to this nonlinearity, the comic may at least help students call into question this machine-like metaphor of reality. The comic medium with its features of braiding and translinearity, multilinearity and multidirectionality, and holism (Cabero, 2019; Groensteen, 2013) may be a place to begin to view this messiness (Cromer & Clark, 2007) . In his work Unflattening, Sousanis (2015b, 62) argues something similar:",

The comic must be at least three panels. (The assignment was slightly modified from what is given above). Regarding the stretching aspect noted above, one student depicted the instruction and education of African Americans from their arrival in America in 1619, through the nineteenth century and up until the 1954 Brown decision. The student had to weave a number of chronological but distant events together. Note: For the exercise below, the instructor can assign a historical topic or let students chose. For the purposes of this book, I have assigned a topic which has many causes: the Common School movement in America. I could also have used the First World War or the French Revolution. In addition, this may be an assignment where the teacher might want to provide an example. Cabero (2019) is a nice accessible article which talks about multilinearity and multidirectionality. Cromer and Clark (2007) specifically talk about the comics form and the study of history. In addition, Sousanis' (2015b) graphic novel would work well here too. These resources could be given to students prior to this assignment. In the appendix, some of my own graphic novels make use of some of these notions. I would show this to my class and use this as an example. Teachers could also find other historical graphic novels and show interesting page configurations as examples. I assigned this assignment to my undergraduate class. While I had many interesting variations, Fig. 4 .1 stood out to me. My students created a game board, and each person in the Common School Movement had a different path to take. I thought this formulation truly showed a nonlinear take on some of the complexities of the Common School Movement. In one box, my students wrote that immigrants had to walk 10 miles to school. When I reviewed the assignment, I questioned them about this piece of information, it seemed excessive. After hearing my student's justification, I decided to leave it, despite my initial reservations. I believe my student was trying to make a point about the plight of immigrants. The point here is that this type of interpretive assignment can help generate these important content-related discussions between student and instructor.",

Skills and dispositions are a little different than concrete historical episodes. It is probably easier to show the beheading of Louis XVI than it is to show cooperation or critical thinking. But precisely because of the complexity of skills and dispositions, they might be well suited to comic art. Following Kelley (2010, 6 ) the art is not simply an \"adjunct\" to the text, rather, art is a type of communication. So, with this in mind, students can use the power of art and words to show skills and dispositions. For instance, can students create a comic which illustrates the disposition of responsibility? Or the skill of collaborative capacities (Cohen, Pickeral, & Levine, 2010) ? As noted above, students can use historical actors (E.g., Thomas Jefferson) or create their own historical (or contemporary) fiction. Is there a story a student could create, using their knowledge of how graphic novels are constructed, which illustrates social trust? Teachers can use the comics form to facilitate student thinking about how to visualize these complex notions. The teaching of skills and dispositions/values should not be mechanistic, however. It should never be the case where citizenship is reduced to performing certain actions-citizenship is much too complex. So, teachers must exercise caution and always be clear that the teaching of skills and dispositions is a useful guide, a way to think about citizenship, but citizenship is just too complex to nail down into a few precepts.",

Students can begin to visualize different situations-and illustrate them-in order to locate different skills and dispositions. Kincheloe (2001) talks a great deal about the specifics. What works in one class may not work in another or at least will need to be modified. There are no universal prescriptions in teaching. The same may hold true for skills and dispositions.

Eisner (2002, 103) asserts: \"By far the most universal image with which the sequential artist must deal is the human form.\" Another relevant concept is that of emotional intelligence. Emotional Intelligence centers on how people can perceive and understand the emotions of others and themselves and then utilize knowledge appropriately (Woolfork, 2016) . The use of emotions to convey ideas and messages, as well as the fostering of emotional intelligence might be aided by the comic form. Teachers can guide their students to think about how certain historical actors reacted in certain situations and how to use emotions to convey ideas. How did Loyalists react to the reading of the Declaration of Independence? Can students imagine and capture this sentiment? Students can learn to draw emotions and through peer editing and collaboration, can decipher the emotions of peer's characters. In the opening chapter, I argued that emotions are crucial to politics.

In comics, the use of encapsulation, or the selective showing of events, can also be utilized. What politicians chose to say or show, or chose to not say or show, can have a huge impact. If we are only told part of a story, it may inflame our emotions-the redacted part might provide more clarity and we may be able to understand why someone acted the way he or she did.

McCloud (2006) outlines some strategies for effective worldbuilding in comics, specifically by focusing on the angle of the shot, attention to depth, the level of detail in the drawing and the absence of word balloons, which gives the impression of silence (Thompson, 2018) . Through a social studies lens, worldbuilding can be related to an understanding of geography, place, environment, and human interactions in the environment. Students can use art to describe and understand places and the interaction of people and places (see the National Council for Social Studies standards for the importance of geography in the social studies). In his Geography of Nowhere, James Howard Kunstler (1993) argues that modern architecture, road building, and city planning can work to destroy the notion of public and civic spaces and any idea of the public good, because we are locked in suburbs and cars. If there is truth in this statement, students can use their comics as a way to design new places, with an eye to creating public and civic spaces and promoting the common good. There may be a fruitful intersection between geography and comics. Students can draw the places they know. They can use these places to build worlds in their comics. From Kunstler's work, I began to understand the link between geography, democracy, and citizenship. The ways that cities and towns are planned and laid out has a crucial impact on how citizens can interact with each other. The existence or lack thereof of public spaces is an important consideration. Reading this work made me think of my own house and neighborhood, and more specifically, the civic potential my neighborhood might possess. This became the foundation for the assignment below.

Chapin (2015) argues that historians consider time, while geographers consider space, but of course these notions are linked. If history is the study of time and geography is the study of space, then comics can help to chronicle both. More specifically, students can use comics to study the history and geography of local places. Local history and geography is something I came to appreciate by accident. I lived on the east coast of the US state of Virginia for 11 years. This is also where I taught social studies. Here, I was inundated with history, from Colonial history, to Revolutionary War history and through the American Civil War. Now I live in Maryland, five miles from the Mason-Dixon Line. Again, I am inundated with history (Gettysburg National Military Park is roughly a 40-minute drive and union soldiers camped out in my little hometown prior to the battle). However, one does not have to have these monumental battle sites to teach local history and geography. Any locality can be used for this purpose (Marino & Crocco, 2012) . It just takes a little research and prep work to figure out what happened in any given place. The point is, social studies teachers can and should utilize all of the resources available to them. Moreover, their locality is a tremendous resource with easy access (Chapin, 2015) . Marino and Crocco (2012) offer a case study for integrating local history into classroom instruction. They posit four points for students to consider when assessing local history; events, themes, people, and buildings. Instead of just considering events, students can look at themes and situate the locality in larger themes that were affecting the country, such as urbanization or industrialization for example (Marino & Crocco, 2012) . Looking at different groups of people that live in a community can be especially pertinent to study immigration (Marino & Crocco, 2012) . Looking at buildings can also be very fruitful. Marino and Crocco (2012, 234) argue that the \"it happened here approach\" is a starting point, but it should not be the end. Acknowledging that something important happened in one's locality can be a way to spark interest, but students can go much deeper than this (Marino & Crocco, 2012) . Students can look at the actual location and consider different geographic questions such as distances to major cities and how travel was different in earlier centuries (Marino & Crocco, 2012) . Students can create timelines of their locality as well as perform a \"neighborhood quest\" where they examine different features of their neighborhood such as local businesses and buildings (Marino & Crocco, 2012, 239) . Students can create a \"then and now\" project of a street. They can obtain a photograph of how a street or building used to look and compare this photo to a modern photo (Marino & Crocco, 2012, 239) . Chapin (2015) similarly argues that students can contextualize the changes experienced by a local community in larger national and international trends occurring at time. Smith (2018) calls attention to the issues of mapmaking, and the phenomena of street names, both of which can help students in the assignments below. Smith (2018) argues that maps, by necessity, are untruthful. This is because maps must include certain details and omit others in order to be of use. While this feature is unavoidable, mapmakers can at least mitigate it in certain ways (Smith, 2018) . There are also more purposeful lies that mapmakers tell, however; maps can be used to establish a preferred vision of space and silence competing accounts. Specifically, Smith (2018) looks at the importance of street names, and how these street names, which must be officially sanctioned by a government, convey preferred histories and versions of events which may be problematic. If maps must include certain details and omit others, this process of inclusion and omission can also be likened to the notions of encapsulation, as well as syntagmatic and paradigmatic choice.",

McCloud (1994, 72) notes that the aspect to aspect transition \"bypasses time for the most part and sets a wandering eye on different aspects of a place, idea or mood.\" Students can use the aspect to aspect transition to highlight different aspects of a local place. Or students can look at the intersection of time and space. Eisner (2002, 46 ) featured a cartoon called \"A Short History of America,\" by famed cartoonist R. Crumb. On the page there are 12 frames. Each frame shows the same place, just at a different time. We go from a pasture to a bustling intersection. This or a variation of this assignment can be a great way to teach local history and geography. This activity also aligns somewhat with Marino and Crocco's (2012) then and now activity. Finally, the nonlinear potential of the comics form (Cabero, 2019; Miodrag, 2013) can also be utilized in these assignments, by allowing students to think outside of strict sequence and linear causation in regard to place. Below, I offer some examples of assignments which utilize the ideas above.",

As noted earlier, and as it pertains to local history, Marino and Crocco (2012) posit that examining larger themes and situating a locality in those themes can be fruitful. For this assignment, students are to go to a historical site and create a short sequence of events that took place at the site. This could also be done with the use of a virtual field trip (Chapin, 2015) . Of course, the teacher will need discretion here because different sites will require different types of sequences (so, the sequence drawn at the Battle of Gettysburg site will look different than the sequence at the Brown versus Board of Education site). The next question has students draw a large circle around the sequence (large enough to draw more pictures inside). Inside the circle, students are then to draw wider themes that were affecting American society. The point here is to think beyond the event and situate the event-visually-in those larger themes. I also think that this exercise can at least touch on the notions of nonlinear considerations, as well as demonstrate nonconventional reading patterns. The large circle around the sequential events may help students think larger than the sequence.",

We visited the Hampton House in Towson Maryland, which was owned by a prominent family in Maryland, the Ridgely family. The Ridgley family also owned a large number of slaves (see the details here: https://www.nps.gov/ hamp/index.htm). As the assignment instructed, my student first drew a sequence where he depicted different scenes from the history of the house, such as slaves working and the Butler performing tasks. In the wider circle, he drew wider themes, such as the American Civil War and the Great depression. In the space for reflection, he commented on each frame and picture by utilizing what we learned in the house. I believe that he was able to situate the specific events of the house in the wider actions and themes taking place in America at the time.

They need to make money to keep going (Wright, 2003) . In order to turn a profit, comic book creators search for formulas or certain themes and stereotypes which become stories (Wright, 2003) . These formulas must appeal to the intended audience and are shaped by those who produce comics and those who consume them, but also by \"historical conditions\" exerted on these groups (Wright, 2003, xv) . Wright (2003, xv) asserts: \"Formulas, therefore, are essentially historical constructions, and they are central to understanding comic books as history.\" One such formula was the notion of Superman. The consideration of these formulas can be an important consideration for students. What sells? Why does it sell? What themes are present? What do these themes and ideas say about our society? Ultimately, comic books (like any other lucrative business) must appeal to the customers. The customers and consumers are indispensable in understanding the impact of comics.",

Jenkins (2014, 65) calls this \"fan activism,\" which is essentially when fans utilize their common knowledge as a means of civic participation. Jenkins (2014, 66) specifically examines the notion of \"cultural acupuncture,\" in which features of a fictional universe are mapped onto real life. Cultural acupuncture allows for fans to utilize their common language and metaphors to help describe and make sense of a situation. Fans of a particular story or universe draw on the shared symbols or the \"cultural currency\" of the story to frame events and act politically (Jenkins, 2014, 68) . Jenkins (2014) shows how this mapping is accomplished with the Harry Potter Association (HPA). The HPA, composed of volunteer and part-time employees, and works for political change in a number of causes, all while utilizing the language and ideas of the Harry Potter Universe. One example is the use of \"Waldemart\" to critique Walmart. Full disclosure: I am not a Harry Potter fan, I just never got into the franchise. However, even I know enough about it to understand the points that Jenkins makes. Even as someone who has not read any of the books, I still immediately understand the connection.

I have specifically argued that they can be applied to the Batman universe and other such rich and complex universes in comics. I presented some of these ideas at the Batman in Popular Culture conference held at Bowling Green State University in April of 2019. I have also spoken about these ideas on the Sectarian Review, which is a podcast that deals with all sorts of pop culture issues and trends and their relation to wider society (https://www.sectarianreviewpodcast.com/episodes-andshow-notes/episode-124-civics-art-and-batman). This podcast broadcasts out of Mt. Aloysius college and is on the Christian Humanist Network. The founder, Danny Anderson, interviews professors and other experts on a wide range of pop culture issues. There are some excellent podcasts which deal specifically with comic book issues. I mention the conference and podcast because they are excellent examples of pop culture resources for students to utilize. Wright's (2003) arguments also form a nice compliment to Jenkins (2014). In a sense, I read Wright's arguments as using comics as a mirror of society, whereas drawing on Jenkin's arguments, we can use comics as a map of society. As such, the assignment below draws on both Wright and Jenkins. As with most of the assignments in this book, this assignment could be done in a number of different ways. Instructors will have to decide how much material and instruction to provide. For the exercise below, I have students reading an excerpt from Wright and from Jenkins. I also focus on the Batman universe, but a teacher could have students pick their own fictional comic universe or assign different ones. This may be an assignment where students should select what they love. If students are not comic readers, an alternate assignment could be given or a universe assigned. This assignment might work best as a take-home project or paper. Finding comics and using them as primary sources (as Wright did) is a form of research and students could be made to understand this (plus it is fun!).",

For my example, I worked from Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's The Killing Joke and utilized the Joker to make a political critique. Of course, I am not the first to do this. A Google search of \"Uncle Sam Joker\" yields a number of different images and variations, some with comic covers featuring the Joker in that position. Wessels and Martinez (2015) examine how many in the Tea Party movement utilized the image of the Joker to critique what they saw as shortcomings of the Obama presidency. In addition, Heldenfels (2015) argues for a Marxist reading of the Joker, while Litsey (2015) views the Joker in Nietzchean terms. The point is that there are a number of political and/or philosophical arguments that can be made of the Joker. As a fan, I utilized elements of the Batman universe to make my political points. So, I situate my analyses of the Joker in this context.",

I utilized the page when Joker becomes the Joker. He just finished his swim in the toxic chemicals. I kept the same overall panel structure and layout. But, I \"mapped\" what I saw as Joker's transformation (into the Joker) and his nihilism to aspects of American government and society. In the background of the first panel, I have the capitol building. I changed the last panel of the page, the panel where we see the Joker for the first time. Instead of Joker running his hands through his hair, I have the Joker dressed as Uncle Sam, pointing at the reader with a hideous smile. There are also newspapers swirling around with images of the military and the stock market. I used specific images for this mapping. I used the Capitol Building to symbolize government and politics (I made a deliberate choice to use the capitol building and not the White House, as I wanted this to be a bipartisan critique), I used Uncle Sam Joker to criticize the transformation of our government. I also have written new words in the panels which read: We are watching/the transformation/of democracy/into/a joke/or maybe/its just returning/to its natural state/maybe/this is the truth. I saw Joker and his transformation as a symbol of our own democracy. I was trying to convey the notion that our republic is a joke, or transforming into a joke. But this transformation may really be its natural state revealing itself. Of course readers can interpret these words any way they want.

However, this situation could be used as a way to discuss political theory, specifically legitimate government as posed by John Locke. In a nutshell, citizens have a responsibility to follow the dictates of their government when that government is legitimate. Governments are legitimate when they uphold the citizens' natural rights of life, liberty, and property and these governments require the obedience of the people (Uzgalis, 2019) . If the government does not uphold these rights, its end of the social contract, citizens can revolt (Gutek, 1995; Uzgalis, 2019) . Perhaps the government of Gotham City is not upholding their end of the contract because it does not protect the citizens, and Batman is a type of revolution.",

Vandiver (2000) asserts how many of the stories in pop culture, such as the Terminator movies, share similarities with ancient myths. She contends that this familiarity is part of the appeal of these stories. We as a society have been inundated with mythical stories for 2500 years. She (2000, 192) writes \"These stories are appealing because twenty-five centuries of repetition have made them familiar and have built them into the texture of our minds.\" In addition, as also mentioned in Chapter 2, Vandiver (2000) argues that our mythmaking impulse has been turned to the future, toward our descendants. She also ponders what other genres besides science fiction might utilize mythmaking. With this in mind, students can use the comic book form to create their own myths. However, an important element in this creation could be the reliance on pre-established myth as a sort of template.

The other consideration is similar to Chapter 2 and deals with the use of a graphic adaptation. For the exercise below. I am using Hinds' Odyssey. However, if no graphic adaptation exists for a specific myth, teachers can modify the questions. Question two can be eliminated. I have only included it so students can get a sense of encapsulation. I assigned my own children a variation of the assignment below when I homeschooled them during the COVID-19 crisis.

I examine this comic in more detail in the assessment section in Chapter 6. Some journalists have turned to comic's journalism (Nyberg, 2012) . Nyberg (2012, 116) asserts \"As a genre of nonfiction comics, comics journalism combines the form of comics with the conventions of journalism.\" One notable comics journalist is Joe Sacco, who created graphic novels from his time spent covering the events in Bosnia and Palestine. Discussion of current events can also be valuable in the social studies classroom (Chapin, 2015) . From my own experience as a social studies teacher for 11 years, I heavily utilized current events in my modern world history classes. Students had to hand in current events for the entire year. I had students find two articles, summarize them, and then link the articles to something we have studied in class. (I once had a student link an impending snowstorm to Napoleon's defeat in Russia.)

While it is generally accepted that museum education is very beneficial, there are still questions on how best to approach and maximize the educational potential of museums (Winstanley, 2018) . This situation may be ideal for the utilization of the comics form. (I also argue something similar for field trips in the next chapter.) The exercise below does not speak to modifying the actual museum experience however, rather it simply provides a different way for students to interpret what they see at the museum. Winstanely (2018), argues that students need to reflect on their experience in the museum to make it worthwhile. Drawing off Dewey, \"reflection entails making connections and relationships between the existing activity and previous knowledge, ideas and experiences, helping people to create meaning\" (Winstanley, 2018, 428) . The use of student comics may help students accomplish this task of reflection. This assignment could also be done by utilizing a virtual tour (Chapin, 2015) .",

This museum chronicles Maryland's history. I have created the assignment below with this museum in mind. Educators will most likely need to tailor this activity to a specific museum.

Write a brief one-sentence summary of the event and why you think it is important. These events should have some continuity. So, maybe they all deal with slavery in Maryland, or with riots and disturbances that have occurred in different centuries in Baltimore. 3. Draw each event and utilize the features of the comic medium. By the time I implemented this assignment, I kind of had an idea of what I was doing. One of my students depicted various riots and mob activity that had taken place in Baltimore over the last three centuries. Here, the art style helped to convey the message. The art is frantic and helps to convey a sense of confusion that characterizes this type of event ( Fig. 4.3) . Another student's comic (Fig. 4.4) featured a brilliant use of strategic color. Her comic, which was all in black and white, had a red line in the fourth frame which runs through the city of Baltimore. My student was trying to show how the practice of redlining had hurt the development of Baltimore. I thought both of these examples demonstrate how the comics medium can help students reflect on and make sense of their museum experience in new creative ways. Figure 4 .2: This is an example of a student-created comic for the local history assignment. In this example, the student drew a sequence of events which helped to depict some events associated with the site, which was a historical mansion. The student also surrounded this sequence by larger historical events and themes which could have impacted the events shown as well. Figure 4 .3: This is an example of a student-created comic for the museum comic assignment. Here, the art style helped to convey the message. The art is frantic and helps to convey a sense of confusion that characterizes this type of event. Figure 4 .4: This is another example of the museum comic.

Part of understanding history is understanding a sense of chronology. In addition, with this assignment, I am trying to get you to think of which events to show and omit. Similar to the notion of encapsulation, historians must make this decision all the time. 2. You must utilize facial expressions and body language to convey moods and feelings. For example, how might a lower class person might have felt upon entering a school for the first time? 3. Use color to convey mood. 4. After you finish the strip, write a justification of the facial expressions, scene choice, how the scenes are related and colors used. Why did you pick these scenes and colors and expressions?

You may want to create a traditional nine-panel grid page (or you may want to use a different variation of frames, it is your choice). In each panel, draw an aspect of your house and neighborhood. Use text to give a brief explanation. Remember, the pictures are not just an add-on. Use the pictures to show what cannot be adequately expressed in words. Show the civic potential, do not just state it. You can include people in the drawings as well. Think also of the angle you utilize to show the geographic location. 3.

After you create your thumbnail, write a brief description justifying why you chose to represent the scenes you did. 5. Exchange comics with a classmate. Compare it with what you have done.
