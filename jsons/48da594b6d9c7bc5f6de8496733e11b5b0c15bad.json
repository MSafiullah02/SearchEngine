The various antigens suspected to play a role in HIV-seronegative IDPN include (i) P 2 protein; (ii) sulfatide (GalS); (iii) various gangliosides (especially GM 1 ); (iv) galactocerebroside (GalC); and (v) glycoproteins or glycolipids with the carbohydrate epitope glucuronyl-3-sulfate. These glycoproteins or glycolipids may be individually targeted, or an immune attack may be raised against a combination of any of these epitopes. The glycolipids, however, especially GalS, have recently evoked much interest as mediators of immune events underlying both non-HIV and HIV-associated demyelinating neuropathies.

[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] DPSN is the commonest neuropathy and it occurs in up to 35% of individuals with advanced HIV infection. 3, 6 Although the pathology of DPSN has been determined as retrograde distal axonal degeneration ('dying back' axonopathy) and drop out of dorsal root ganglion neurons, 12, 13 little is known of its pathogenesis. In contrast, two other types of HIV-associated neuropathies, inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDPN) (in both acute (AIDPN) and chronic (CIDPN) forms), and vasculitic neuropathy have clinical and pathological features that suggest an autoimmune pathogenesis. Both occur during phases of HIV infection in which T lymphocytes are not significantly depleted so that sensitization of T cells to peripheral nerve antigens can occur. Circulating antibodies of IgG and IgM isotypes against myelin have been found in the serum of HIVseropositive individuals with IDPN and vasculitic neuropathy, and symptomatic improvement after plasmapheresis has been recorded in both groups. 14 To date only a small number of individuals with HIV infection and symptoms of neuropathy has been studied. There are no data regarding the prevalence of antibodies against peripheral myelin and axonal epitopes in HIV-infected individuals without overt neuropathic symptoms.

A small proportion of patients has axonal degeneration which is sometimes the predominant feature. 15, 18 Microscopic examination of nerve biopsies reveals moderate subperineurial edema reflecting breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier (BNB), small numbers of lymphocytes near endoneurial vessels and within the endoneurial space, and demyelinated and remyelinating fibers.

The majority of IgM and IgG antibody reactivity was found to be directed against GalS (Fig. 1) . Of the 35 HIV-positive samples screened by ELISA, five were considered to have raised anti-GalS IgM antibody titers (i.e. \u03fe 1000 arbitrary units (AU)/L) and six samples had raised anti-GalS IgG antibody titers (\u03fe 1000 AU/L; Tables 1,2). 83 The reactivity of these antibodies, which was directed specifically against GalS, was localized by indirect immunofluorescence to myelin (Fig. 2a,b) . In teased nerve fiber preparations it was clear that although staining of myelin was diffuse, staining at the paranodal regions and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures was more intense (Fig. 2c,d) . 84 These anti-GalS antibodies were present in HIVinfected individuals with and without immunosuppression. 82 This suggests that in immunosuppressed HIVpositive individuals (CD4 lymphocyte counts \u03fd 200/\u00b5L of peripheral blood), CD5-positive B cells may be responsible for producing autoantibodies against the carbohydrate moieties of peripheral myelin glycolipids because high-titer antibodies were present in these patients. Alternatively, these antibodies may be generated during hypergammaglobulinemia 85 because polyclonal generation of immunoglobulins is common in HIV infection even when immunosuppression is severe. 85, 86 A significant association between the presence of autoantibodies in HIV-infected patients and the depletion of CD4 lymphocyte counts has been documented. 87 Massabki et al., however, found that patients with low-titer autoantibodies do not develop autoimmune disease. 87 In contrast, our findings indicate that certain antiglycolipid antibodies (specifically IgG anti-GalS) can be present in very high titers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 150, "text": "82", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 770, "end": 772, "text": "83", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1117, "text": "84", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1223, "text": "82", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1620, "text": "85", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1739, "text": "85,", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1742, "text": "86", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 1897, "end": 1899, "text": "87", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2013, "text": "87", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 522, "end": 530, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 910, "end": 921, "text": "(Fig. 2a,b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1112, "text": "(Fig. 2c,d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "ANTI-GALS ANTIBODIES"}, {"text": "In the present study, titers of IgG anti-GalS antibodies in HIV-infected patients were as high as 10 000 AU/L compared with IgM anti-GalS antibody titers of up to 2000 AU/L.

As already explained, however, IgG levels do not necessarily decline with declining CD4 lymphocyte count, because the epitope it recognizes is a glycoconjugate (in this case a glycolipid). The CD5-positive B cells are most likely responsible for the production of antiglycolipid antibodies in HIV-positive individuals. 38, 165 Activation of these cells may be due to the glycolipid (most likely GalS) being presented to the immune system in an altered fashion. GalS may become incorporated into viral envelope protein during the course of productive infection (i.e. cells containing GalS within their membrane) and the viral budding process. 74 The integration of GalS into the viral membrane may be the trigger for the immune system to begin synthesizing autoantibodies against the carbohydrate moiety of the molecule.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 219, "text": "80", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 446, "end": 449, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 450, "end": 453, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 454, "end": 457, "text": "66,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 458, "end": 461, "text": "67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 462, "end": 467, "text": "[159]", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 468, "end": 473, "text": "[160]", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 474, "end": 479, "text": "[161]", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 480, "end": 485, "text": "[162]", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 486, "end": 491, "text": "[163]", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 492, "end": 497, "text": "[164]", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 935, "end": 938, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 939, "end": 942, "text": "165", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1260, "text": "74", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral budding"}, {"text": "Recently, evidence has shown that budding HIV-1 particles produced by infected T cell lines occurs selectively from glycolipid enriched membrane regions ('lipid rafts') which include GM 1 . 166 These investigators demonstrated by confocal microscopy that lipid raft-associated molecules, including the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins Thy-1 and CD59 and GM 1 , colocalize with HIV-1 proteins.
