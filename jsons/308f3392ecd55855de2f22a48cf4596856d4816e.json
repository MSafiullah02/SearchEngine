The leaked air into the pulmonary perivascular interstitium follows the path of least resistance from the mediastinum to the fascial planes of the neck. Air freely communicates via the neural foramina and collects in the epidural space. Pneumorrhachis is defined as the presence of air in the spinal canal, either in the intradural and/or extradural spaces. It is a very rare clinical entity and mostly asymptomatic, hence most probably underdiagnosed. Many pathological and physiological events can lead to alveolar rupture, and these clinical findings can be related to various, mainly traumatic and iatrogenic etiologies. Herein we report three cases of pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, interstitial emphysema and pneumorrhachis in two cases, which were related to rhinovirus, human bocavirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection.",

Pneumomediastinum is a benign condition that is occasionally associated with subcutaneous emphysema and occasionally with pneumothorax, but is rarely associated with pneumorrhachis (PR). 1 Pneumorrhachis, \"air within the spinal epidural space\", occurs in a variety of settings, including skull and spinal fractures, epidural abscess, epidural anesthesia, lumbar puncture, and traumatic pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Although it is rare, there have been documented cases in the literature in which bronchial asthma also contributed to the development of PR. 2 In PR, increase in the intra-alveolar pressure secondary to vigorous cough leads to rupture of alveoli, resulting in air leaks in the peribronchovascular space, where it follows the path of least resistance to the mediastinal, pleural spaces and fascial planes of the neck. There are no fascial barriers to prevent communication of the posterior mediastinum or the retro-pharyngeal space with the epidural space. Air thus freely communicates via the neural foramina and collects in the epidural space. 3 There are no standard guidelines for the management of symptomatic PR, and its treatment is often individualized.",

Pneumomediastinum can also occur secondary to chest injury, mechanical ventilation and thoracic surgery. 4,5 Pneumomediastinum usually results from mechanisms that increase alveolar pressure, which leads to alveolar rupture. By direct extension, air enters the interstitial tissues and spreads easily into the mediastinal borders. Air in the mediastinal tissues may originate from the respiratory tract, such as after blunt or penetrating trauma to the facial bones, pharynx, trachea and mainstem bronchi. In this report patient 1 had a history of suspected abdominal mild trauma not associated with the pneumomediastinum. 4 In spontaneous pneumomediastinum, PR develops when air travels along fascial planes from the posterior mediastinum or the retropharyngeal space through the neural foramens into the epidural space, which is not protected by a true fascial envelope. PR is becoming somewhat more often diagnosed as imaging techniques improve. Here, we described PR in two patients. Most recent surveys suggest that PR associated with spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum with asymptomatic neurological status is self-limiting in 98% of cases. 6 Two of the present patients were neurologically asymptomatic.",

Asymptomatic patients and those with minimal neurological symptoms due to PR associated with pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax are efficiently managed conservatively with high-flow oxygen inhalation, which enhances reabsorption of the air by nitrogen washout, and further helps in symptomatic improvement in high-pressure PR, in which air under pressure has entered the epidural space. 4 Thus PR should be treated based on etiology and severity of symptoms; surgery, antibiotics, foreign body removal from the trachea, and bronchodilators in chronic bronchitis will be used on a case-by-case basis. 3 In conclusion, spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax and PR secondary to viral infection is a self-limiting and benign condition that should not be over-investigated or over-treated.",
