A characteristic of this technique is the ability to visually present sequence information of amplicons without using an expensive source of light or a detector. The new detection method described above utilises the unique nature of low-molecular-weight PEI, i.e. it cannot form an insoluble complex with a singlestranded anionic polymer with a low-molecular weight such as an oligo DNA probe, but it can form an insoluble complex with DNA with a high-molecular weight such as LAMP product. Since a large amount of amplification product is created by the LAMP reaction, precipitate of a size that can be easily confirmed with the eyes is generated when PEI is added to the LAMP reac-tion solution. Moreover, the fact that the amplification is highly efficient means that the amount of labelled probe for detection that can be added is large. As a result of these characteristics, the LAMP reaction followed by addition of PEI yields precipitate with a clear colour and in a size that can be identified visually. If the 5 0 end of the internal primer is fluorescently labelled, the LAMP product should be visible, but this approach is not preferred, because the possibility of false positives from self-extension of the labelled primer cannot be excluded. There is no risk of false positives with the oligo DNA probes fluorescently labelled at the 3 0 end, so that highly accurate genetic testing can be established.

Because of the high specificity of the LAMP method, only the target gene will be amplified from gene samples containing homologous nucleotide sequences when using LAMP-based SNP typing [34, 35] . Furthermore, because of the characteristics of its amplification reaction, the LAMP method discriminates a single nucleotide difference at each cycling step of the DNA replication, through both 'sense and antisense strand' reactions, and the type of SNP can easily be detected just by amplifying the DNA containing SNP in a single step. Due to the simplicity and rapidity of the LAMP method, simple detection of SNP typing can be achieved within 30 min. The products of the LAMP reaction, which was performed in the presence of an intercalating dye, were detected within 30 min without any post-reaction sample manipulation. With the use of four primers designed to recognise six distinct regions, only the target gene is strictly and specifically amplified even in coexistence with its homologous gene. The reaction is so specific as to strictly discriminate single nucleotide difference. The basic principles of LAMP-SNP typing rely on the use of wt primers. The FIP and BIP are designed to contain a SNP nucleotide (wt allele) at 5 0 end. Using the wt primers, when the target gene is the wt allele, DNA synthesis from dumbbell-like starting structure proceeds and the LAMP amplification cycling continues ( Figure 6 ). In contrast, when the target gene is the mutant (MUT) allele, no DNA synthesis proceeds from the dumbbell-like structure and the LAMP amplification cycling does not occur. Even if DNA synthesis proceeds for one step due to miscopy, the amplification reaction is either halted in other steps or is delayed since repetition of this reaction continually checks at each cycling step of the DNA replication. By simply incubating genomic DNA and reagents, including fluorescent detection reagent, at a constant temperature (60 C) for a fixed period of time, SNP typing can be achieved by determining whether amplification has taken place.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 308, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 309, "end": 312, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1526, "end": 1534, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "LAMP in SNP typing"}, {"text": "LAMP has all the characteristics required of realtime assays (high sensitivity, quantitative) along with simple operation for easy adaptability to field conditions.

Thus LAMP is considered to be effective as a gene amplification method for g-POCT devices, which can be used for simple genetic testing whenever and wherever necessary.

Briefly the FIP anneals to the single stranded region in the stem-loop DNA and primes strand displacement DNA synthesis, releasing the previously synthesised strand. This released single strand forms a stem-loop structure at the 3 0 end because of complementary B1c and B1 regions. Then, starting from the 3 0 end of the B1 region, DNA synthesis starts using self-structure as a template, and releases FIP-linked complementary strand. The released single strand then forms a dumbbell-like structure as both ends have complementary F1-F1c and B1c-B1 regions, respectively.
