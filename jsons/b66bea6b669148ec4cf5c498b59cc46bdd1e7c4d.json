            "text": "Under the epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 , chest X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs, which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs, even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average norm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given target class.",

The epidemic of COVID-19 started from Wuhan, China [2] , and has had a serious impact on public health and economy globally [3] . To reduce the spread of this epidemic, effective screening of COVID-19 patients is required. For this purpose, positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are mainly used [4] ; however, they are often time-consuming, laborious, and involve complicated manual processes. Chest radiography imaging, especially chest X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging, is an alternative screening method [5] , because patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images, which are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19 [2, 6] . Moreover, there are advantages to leveraging chest X-ray imaging for COVID-19 screening amid the pandemic in terms of rapid triaging, portability, availability, and accessibility [7] . However, the visual differences in chest X-ray images among COVID-19-associated pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and no pneumonia are subtle; thus, the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in number, forms a bottleneck for diagnoses based on radiography images. To avoid this limitation, computer-aided systems that can aid radiologists to more rapidly and accurately interpret radiography images to detect COVID-19 cases are highly desired [7, 8] ; in particular, deep neural networks (DNNs) are often used for this purpose.",

Specifically, DNN-based systems can detect subtle visual differences in the images; in particular, a DNN can accurately distinguish bacterial and viral pneumonia in chest X-ray images [11] . Inspired by these previous studies, many researchers have constructed large-scale datasets of chest radiography images on COVID-19 [7, 8, 12, 13] and have proposed DNN-based systems for screening COVID-19 cases from these images [8, [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, DNN-based systems in medical science have generally been closed-source and unavailable to the research community for deeper understanding and extension. Thus, Wang et al. [7] proposed COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored to detect COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images, which is opensource and available to the general public. As the authors mentioned [7] , this study will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate COVID-19 treatment. The COVID-Net models are intended to be used as reference models; in fact, several DNN-based systems [18] [19] [20] for detecting COVID-19 cases have already been proposed, inspired by the COVID-Net study.",

Notably, a single perturbation (called universal adversarial perturbation; UAP) [23] that can induce DNN failure in most image classification tasks is also known to exist. Moreover, DNNs are less robust to not only nontargeted attacks [23] , which cause misclassification (i.e., a task failure resulting in an input image being assigned an incorrect class), but also targeted attacks [24] , which cause the DNN to classify an input image into a specific class. The existence of adversarial examples questions the generalization ability of DNNs, reduces model interpretability, and limits the applications of deep learning in safety-and security-critical environments [25] . Specifically, vulnerability is a serious problem in medical diagnosis [26] . Thus, it is important to evaluate how vulnerable the proposed DNN-based systems are to adversarial attacks (attacks based on UAPs, in particular) in practical applications. In addition, defense strategies against adversarial attacks (i.e., adversarial defense [22] ) are required.",

This result is consistent with the tendency that DNN models classify most inputs into a few specific classes due to nontargeted UAPs (i.e., existence of dominant labels in nontargeted attacks based on a UAP) [23] . moreover, this indicates that the models provide false positives in COVID-19 diagnosis, which may cause unwanted mental stress to patients and complicate the estimation of the number of COVID-19 cases. The dominant label of COVID-19, observed in this study, may be because the COVIDx dataset was imbalanced. The images in COVID-19 are dominantly fewer than those in normal and pneumonia. The algorithm considers maximizing the fooling rate; thus, a relatively large fooling rate is achieved when all inputs are classified into COVID-19 due to UAPs. In addition, the observed dominant label may be because the losses were computed by weighting to COVID-19 class. The decision for the COVID-19 class might be more susceptive to changes in pixel values than that for the other classes.",

An alternative may be to consider black-box systems, such as closed application programming interfaces (APIs) and closed-source software in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are accessible. Such closed APIs are better because they are at least publicly available. However, it is possible that the APIs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This is because UAPs have generalizability [23] (i.e., UAPs for a DNN can fool another DNN). That is, the adversarial attacks on black-box DNN-based systems may be possible using UAPs generated based on white-box DNNs. Moreover, several methods for adversarial attacks on black-box DNN-based systems, which estimate adversarial perturbations using only model outputs (e.g., confidence scores), have been proposed [31] [32] [33] .",

In fact, we demonstrated that iterative fine-tuning of a DNN model using UAPs improved the robustness of the DNN model to nontargeted and targeted UAPs (Fig. 5) . However, the iterative fine-tuning method required high computational costs; moreover, it did not perfectly avoid vulnerability to UAPs. In addition, several methods breaching defenses using adversarial retraining have already been proposed [27] . Alternatively, dimensionality reduction (e.g., principle component analysis), distributional detection (e.g., maximum mean discrepancy), and normalization detection (e.g., dropout randomization) may be useful for adversarial defenses; however, adversarial examples are not easily detected using these approaches [27] . Defending against adversarial attacks is a cat-and-mouse game [26] ; thus, it may be difficult to completely avoid security concerns caused by adversarial attacks. However, the development of methods for defending against adversarial attacks has been advanced. For example, detecting adversarial attack-based robustness to random noise [34] , use of a discontinuous activation function that purposely invalidates the DNN's gradient at densely distributed input data points [35] , and DNNs for purifying adversarial examples [36] may help reduce the concerns.",
