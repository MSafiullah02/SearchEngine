Data collected by the Health Interview Survey have demonstrated the overall scope of these illnesses. 1 The Health Interview Survey defines acute conditions as those not lasting more than 3 months but requiring a physician consultation or restriction of daily activity. Only illnesses with onsets in the 2 weeks before the survey were reported. Table 1 shows the 1995 survey data on all acute conditions, categorized by age of the patient and, more specifically, by conditions involving the respiratory tract. Of all acute illnesses, respiratory conditions are the most common, generally occurring twice as frequently as the next most common condition. 1 Within the category of respiratory conditions, influenza was reported more frequently than the common cold, despite the fact that colds occur more commonly. Illnesses were identified based simply by name, and not based on clinical characteristics. Furthermore, the specific questions varied over time. This is likely because of the fact that reporting in this survey was limited to more severe conditions (those involving a physician consultation or restricted activity), which are more apt to be recalled by the respondent. Therefore, in the Health Interview Survey the incidence of influenza is probably overestimated and that of the common cold underestimated. Although this survey may not represent the true incidence of these infections, the data do report all respiratory illnesses in the context of conditions requiring physician consultation. They support the finding that respiratory infections cause significant morbidity and are a major reason for physician visits and restricted activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 208, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 758, "end": 759, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 450, "end": 457, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Epidemiology of Viral Respiratory Infections"}, {"text": "Compared with the Health Interview Survey, a more accurate estimation of the frequency of viral respiratory infections (VRIs) in the US population is derived from long-term family and community studies.

The second part began again in 1976 and concluded in 1981. Data were collected using weekly questionnaires to identify illness onset, specimen collection for agent isolation from participants with illness, and regular blood col-lection for serologic identification of infection. 2 Simple reporting of an illness without specific required symptoms was insufficient for an episode to be recognized as an acute respiratory illness. The mean annual incidence of total respiratory infections (mostly viral) is shown in Table 3 . Because of the number of subjects followed, it was also possible to examine the difference in incidence between males and females (Figure 1) . 7 Illnesses were more frequent in young boys than in girls up to 3 years of age, at which point the incidence became more frequent in females. At age 5 to 9 years, the frequency of respiratory illnesses in general began to decrease. The increase in frequency at age 20 to 29 years might be explained by exposure of family members to young children with respiratory infections. The increase occurred to a greater extent in females. Further analysis of data from the study 8 showed that women who did not work outside the home had higher rates of respiratory illness than women who worked out of the home.

Further specific causes have been determined by specially designed studies. In the Tecumseh study, the viruses causing all respiratory infections were reported. The distribution of pathogens was determined by self-reported illness, whether it was a specific syndrome (ie, influenza) or an illness with only 1 symptom. In the Tecumseh study, rhinoviruses were by far the most frequent viral isolate identified in the overall population (Figure 3) . 10 In the first phase of the study, an infectious agent was detected in only approximately 25% of the specimens collected. 2 Not all specimens collected yielded virus isolates, partly because advanced diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were not available at the time the study was conducted. Table 6 shows the annual isolation rates of various respiratory viruses by age (actual rates per 1,000 personyears) during the second phase of the study, from 1976 to 1981. Rates per 100 person-years were adjusted by the proportion of illnesses actually sampled. 8 The adjustments approximate isolation rates as if all infections had been sampled. Both rates were based on actual isolation of virus. Nonculturable viruses, or those lost during shipping from the site to the laboratory, were not included. Again, in this second phase, rhinoviruses were the most frequently isolated agents in all age groups. Table 7 shows the relative role or impact of various respiratory viruses in producing acute respiratory infections. 8 In this table, estimates were made of the degree to which virus-isolation techniques underestimated the actual role of each agent in infection, and an appropriate adjustment was made. (As mentioned, PCR techniques did not exist at the time this study was conducted.) Rhinovirus rates were adjusted based on a study of the common cold in which previous organ culture technique identified viruses that did not replicate in ordinary cell culture. Based on these studies, rhinoviruses were still the most common isolate. Of note is the large percentage of illnesses for which the cause could not be determined.

These seasonality data were confirmed in studies that used interferon-alpha for seasonal prophylaxis against rhinovirus infection in a university student population. 13 The small peak in the spring has a variable pattern because of the size of the United States and differing seasonal weather patterns nationwide. 2 Worldwide, the seasonality of rhinoviruses and other respiratory agents varies geographically, according to temperate versus cold and/or rainy climates. 14 Whereas it is difficult to determine, based on current data, how climate affects the known occurrence of rhinovirus in temperate areas, such data are available for influenza, which is most prevalent in the rainy season in those areas with little temperature fluctuation.

The mode of transmission of rhinovirus has been widely debated over the years. 2 Experimental studies of natural transmission of rhinovirus to determine routes and probability of transmission are rarely feasible and often cannot approximate natural transmission. Therefore, conclusions are typically drawn from epidemiologic observations. For example, influenza can transmit easily by airborne spread, that is, by aerosol as well as by large droplet. 15 Colds were believed to be transmitted by large droplet only. However, it was shown experimentally that rhinovirus infection could be produced by inoculating contaminated secretions from infected individuals into the noses or eyes of volunteers. 15 The question remained as to whether rhinovirus is transmitted primarily by direct contact, that is, by droplet nuclei or by indirect contact. The transmission issue is still controversial. Gwaltney and Hendley 16 showed that rhinoviruses could survive on surfaces and that rhinoviruses could be transmitted by finger-to-nose inoculation. This group from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville considered that contact with infected secretions is the principal mode of transmission. They found that volunteers in contact with contaminated objects or with the fingers of individuals with rhinovirus colds had a high rate of infection if they inoculated their own noses or eyes. Further-more, the investigators discovered that transmission could be interrupted by treating surfaces of contaminated objects with disinfectant or by applying iodine to the fingers. They found little evidence of transmission by means of droplets. 17 In contrast, Dick et al, 18 from the University of Wisconsin, showed that this mechanism is not required for rhinovirus transmission, and they found evidence that rhinovirus could be spread by droplet transmission. Those studies were carried out with volunteers, one of whom was inoculated with virus. Others were known to be susceptible to the virus and were exposed to the infected individuals under different circumstances. In the final experiment, the volunteers played cards with each other. One was experimentally infected, and all wore collars preventing their putting hands in their noses or eyes.

There are thus sufficient data to suggest that close exposure to a person with infection, especially in the family setting, is required and is a major risk factor for acquiring rhinovirus infection.
