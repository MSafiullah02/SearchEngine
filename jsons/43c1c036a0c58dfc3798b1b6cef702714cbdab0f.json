Enclosed spaces, such as public transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for the design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide smart card travel data collected in Sydney, Australia to classify bus passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different groups of passengers, that would remain hidden when considering only a single dimension. We also identify groups that are more influential than others given specific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination efforts.",

Ongoing population growth and the high reliance of individuals on public transport services in highly populated cities provide a suitable platform for contagious diseases, such as measles, the recently emerged coronavirus and influenza, to spread widely and rapidly [3] [4] [5] . For example, individuals travelling on a bus are in close enough proximity to infect each other and can carry the infection to distant locations across the public transport network [6] [4] . Additionally, some pathogens may remain in the environment (e.g. a bus) for a prolonged period and can infect susceptible individuals after the infectious person has left the area [1] [7] . Furthermore, transport services shorten distances and times and strongly connect different suburbs, potentially exposing communities to a high infection risk [4] . The risk of disease spread due to human movement is evident from the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China and internationally, with Chinese authorities shutting down public transportation within the affected area [5] .",

By considering the three dimensions simultaneously, we identify previously unknown mobility behaviours. The high spatiotemporal resolution of the dataset allows us to construct a time resolved physical human contact network to simulate disease spread. Specifically, we trace the infection flows between groups of passengers who display different mobility behaviours to investigate the change in the spreading dynamics. In addition, we investigate how changes in the infection probability and the time pathogens remain suspended in the environment affect the spreading of the disease. This study identifies the most influential passenger groups in a disease spread scenario for different disease characteristics and types. Our simulation results identify four dominant transmission paths between the mobility groups that should become a focus of containment efforts. In addition, we find that highly connected passengers who regularly visit the same places have the highest spreading power when pathogens do not remain in the environment. However, with an increase in the suspension time of pathogens, highly connected passengers who visit new locations become the most efficient spreaders. An increase in the infection probability on the other hand, amplifies the spreading power of all mobility groups, especially for passengers who regularly visit the same places and travel short distances, until reaching a saturation point at a probability of 0.5.",

In Section IV we run extensive trace driven simulations to investigate the underlying interactions and disease transmission dynamics between the different groups of passengers. Furthermore, we study the effect of changing the infection probability and the time pathogens remain in the environment on the transmission dynamics.

First, changing the proportion of the mobility groups alters the topology and the characteristics of the network being studied. Second, the contact links connect geographical areas rather then actual human physical encounters. Third, their study of spreading power was performed on a static network in which if a link existed at any point in time that link is considered present during the entire period of study.

The authors of [24] stated that bus routes \"are veins connecting even the most diverse of populations\" and showed that individuals who reported regular use of buses are more likely to be infected by tuberculosis. In fact, the congregated and enclosed setting of buses presents a suitable environment for any contagious respiratory disease to spread widely.

Furthermore, through extensive simulations, we showed that explorers are generally more influential in spreading a disease through the network in comparison to returners. Also, long distance travellers were found to be more influential than short distance travellers. However, when only long distance travellers are considered returners showed a greater propensity in spreading the disease over explorers. The work proved the presence of a deeper and more complex interplay between various mobility aspects when it comes to spreading a disease on a public transport system. In our previous work we did not consider the connectivity aspect of the individuals, which holds critical information in contact based spreading scenarios. Further, our simulations only considered direct encounters between passengers and assumed an infection probability of 1. While disease transmission is possible through direct encounters (i.e. the infected and the susceptible individual are present in the same place at the same time), pathogens can remain in the environment for an extended period of time [1] [7] . Therefore, an infectious person can infect susceptible individuals without a direct encounter. Contact networks where only direct encounters are considered are commonly called SPST (same place same time) networks. Networks that in addition to direct contacts capture indirect encounters caused by suspended pathogen are called SPDT (same place different time) networks. Previous studies have shown that considering the suspension time of pathogens changes the underlying topology of the contact network and alters the spreading dynamics of contagious diseases significantly [1] [7] . This paper addresses the limitations of our previous work through the addition of the connectivity dimension and by considering different suspension times of particles and infection probabilities. We identify groups of passengers that have a high potential to spread a disease through a public bus network. Although there are several studies that recognized the importance of human mobility data to identify the most influential individuals in a network, none of the studies tried to use a comprehensive mobility dataset to extract patterns along different movement aspects simultaneously and study the detailed interaction between the different patterns. In particular, we consider the passengers' total mobility, recurrent mobility and connectivity. The impact of each group on the spreading will be evaluated as all the infectious activities occurring in the background of the simulations are traced.",

The dataset is recorded in the greater Sydney area of New South Wales, Australia during the month of April in 2017. Each trip record records the following information: the passenger's smart card identification, the bus number in use and the time and location the passenger entered and exited the bus. Sydney for a short time or travellers who lost or damaged their card. As infrequent travellers cannot be classified accurately due to the lack of sufficient data records, we remove these passengers from our analysis. In order to explore how a threshold on the number of trips affects the total number of passengers included in our analysis, we plot in Fig. 3 the population size against varying threshold values between 1 and the maximum number of trips observed in the data. The population size drops rapidly with the increase of the threshold especially at low values. This is due to the high number of passengers who use the bus only occasionally (see Fig. 2 ). For our analysis, we set the threshold to 15 trips per month. That is, individuals who travelled less than 15 times with the bus during April are excluded from the analysis. The threshold of 15 trips is chosen so that the passengers have travelled at least on half of the days of the month. The final dataset has 36,013,436 records belonging to 424,290 bus passengers. In Fig. 4 we compare some key topological aspects of the original and the resulting networks. Figure 4 .a shows the distribution of connected component sizes for both networks. We notice that the two networks have similar structures, with a giant component and several smaller components. There are fewer components of size one in the resulting network, which can be attributed to the fact that the original network contained many infrequent travellers who were isolated from the rest of the network. This observation also applies to the isolated components consisting of less than eleven individuals. Figure 4 .b shows the degree distribution of the original and the resulting networks. The degree of a passenger is the total number of direct encounters experienced during the month of April. We notice that the degree distributions of the original and the resulting networks increase linearly until reaching maximum values of 9,726 and 5,521 respectively. Then both distributions drop exponentially. The drop in the frequencies of the resulting network is due to the removal of passengers who travelled less than 15 trips. The difference between the two distributions is especially clear at low degree values as passengers with few number of trips are less likely to have higher number of contacts.",

Dividing the total number of infections caused by a given group by its population size results in the average number of infections that one individual from that group causes during the simulation period. This average value of infections is not constrained to a specific target group but to all groups in the network. Similarly, dividing the total number of infections received by a given group by its population size, results in the average number of infections that one individual of that group receives during the simulation period. Interestingly, the averages of received infections per individual is nearly the same across all the groups with a value just divide individuals into explorers and returners, but to distinguish them further along other dimensions such as the distance travelled and the connectivity as their spreading abilities differ. In order to visualise the disease transmission dynamics between the groups we use a chord diagram (see Fig. 7 ). The diagram shows cumulative disease flows between the different groups. The eight different groups are represented by circle segments, with each group being associated to a unique colour. For example, the red segment corresponds to highly connected explorers who travel long distances (see label \"A\" in Fig.  7) . The links indicate the volume of disease transmissions between any two groups and are assigned the same colour as the source group. The thickness of each link is proportional to the average number of people that one individual from the source group infects in the target group. For example, the link labeled \"B\" shows the volume of disease flow transmitted from the group of highly connected explorers who travel long distances (red segment) to the group of highly connected returners who travel short distances (blue segment). Links that start and end at the same segment represent disease transmissions between individuals of the same mobility group.

Highly connected explorers who travel long distances (red segment) infect on average 0.5 highly connected returners who travel short distances (blue segment) during the simulation period. Highly connected explorers who travel short distances (orange segment) infect on average 0.47 highly connected returners who travel short distances (blue segment). Furthermore, low connected returners who travel short distances form a group that is prone to receive infections, but less likely to infect individuals from other groups (see the incoming non-pink links that occupy the majority (77%) of the pink segment in Fig. 7 and Table I ). On the other hand, highly connected explorers who travel long distances have caused the greatest number of infections per individual on average. However, this group is less likely to get infected in comparison to other groups (see red segment in Fig. 7) . We observe that the disease transmissions from highly connected explorers who travel long distances dominate this group's activity as the red outgoing links going to all other groups constitute the majority of the segment with more than 90%. That is, even a low number of infected individuals of this group would be sufficient to infect other groups and spread the disease through the entire network. Highly connected explorers who travel long distances infect 1.7 individuals on average during the simulation period. Highly connected returners who travel short distances receive a high number of infections and mostly infect individuals within their own group (see blue segment in Fig. 7 ). This behaviour is expected, as this group consists of regular commuters who display consisted movement behaviour. Highly connected returners who travel long distances (see cyan segment in Fig.  7 ) display a similar behaviour of mostly infecting individuals within their own group.

For each value of d t we construct a matrix that shows the difference in the average number of infections caused and received by each mobility group in comparison to experiment 1 (\u03b2 = 1, d t = 0). Positive values refer to a gain in disease transmissions, whereas negative values indicate a loss. The rows of the matrix correspond to the groups that cause the infections and the columns correspond to the groups that receive the infections. Figures 8.a and 8 .b show the matrices for a suspension time of 15 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. The matrix in Fig.  8 .a shows that the average number of infections caused per individual increased or remained the same for the four groups of explorers (top four rows of the matrix). The spreading potential of the four groups of returners (bottom four rows of the matrix) generally decreased. As the suspension time is increased to 30 minutes, we observe further increases in the average number of infections caused by explorers and further decreases for returners (see Fig. 8 .b). We highlight that the increase in d t weakens the spread of infections within (self-loops) the two groups of highly connected returners. The loss in the infection power of returners coincides with an increase in infections caused by explorers, especially for highly connected explorers who travel long distances. Since almost every individual of the population is infected at the end of the simulation period, we conclude that an increase in the time that pathogens remain in the environment favours the infection power of explorers. That is, explorers are even more influential in an SPDT disease spread scenario. We only show the results for d t = 15 and 30 as no change in the behaviour was seen for d t = 60 and 120, the values for explorers keep increasing and those of returners decrease.",

The average number of infections caused per individual increases rapidly for all groups with an increase of \u03b2 from 0.05 to 0.25. This result is visualised in Fig. 9 with all matrix elements being positive. When \u03b2 is increased from 0.25 to 0.5 we see only a slight increase in the spreading power of all groups. Further increases of \u03b2 to 0.75 and 1 do not result in significant changes in spreading powers. Figure 9 shows that all individuals who travel short distances experienced the most increase in the number of received infections, whether they are low or highly connected. This pattern can be seen through the dark coloured columns of the short distances groups. The observation is due to these groups constituting the highest percentages in the network allowing them to have the highest total number of encounters (see Fig.  6 and Table I ). In addition, the increase in the probability of infection strengthens the self-loops of the groups (infections within the same group), especially those of the short distance returners. We conclude that increasing the infection probability favours the spreading power all mobility groups. The increase of spreading power is relative to the interaction between each pair of mobility groups. For increasing infection probabilities each element in the matrix increases until ultimately reaching the values presented in Section IV-B in which the probability is set to 1.",

We found previously unknown mobility patterns that were thoroughly investigated to understand the spreading dynamics of contagious diseases on a city wide public transport system. We ran extensive disease spread simulations with varying values for the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different groups of travellers. Furthermore, the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens play different roles in the spread. Highly connected passengers who regularly return to the same places play the most important role in the spreading when pathogens do not remain in the environment. However, with an increase in the suspension time of pathogens, highly connected passengers who visit new locations are the most influential. Unlike the suspension time, increasing the infection probability does not affect particular mobility groups, but increases the infection power of all groups especially for returners who travel short distances. Our simulation experiments are abstractions of the real-world and flexible to adapt to different contexts. We presented a framework that can be applied to model any disease that is spread through a physical contact network. Our findings are especially beneficial to advise health authorities on the design of more efficient intervention and containment strategies depending on the characteristics of the emerging diseases. We plan to open-source the modified simulator in order to be used broadly for similar types of datasets and scenarios.",
