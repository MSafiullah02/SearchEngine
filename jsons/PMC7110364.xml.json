The standard treatment for H. pylori infections has depended on antibiotics in combination with proton pump inhibitors (Bazzoli et al., 2002). Antibiotic-based triple therapies are, however, not practical for global control due to the high cost, patients' noncompliance and low effectiveness due to the development of antibiotic resistance among strains of H. pylori (Telford & Ghiara, 1996; Michetti, 1997). Vaccination against H. pylori is therefore one of the most effective ways to control H. pylori infection and, indeed, administration of oral bacterial antigens can protect mice against H. pylori infection (Ferrero et al., 1994; Marchetti et al., 1998; Kotloff et al., 2001; Nystr\u00f6m & Svennerholm, 2007).",

            "text": "\nHelicobacter pylori synthesizes a urease to buffer the pH of its immediate surroundings within the stomach. The role of urease in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated diseases is not limited to colonization as ammonia produced by the urease enters the H. pylori nitrogen metabolism and is eventually incorporated into proteins (Williams et al., 1996). Urease might also help to recruit neutrophils and monocytes in the inflamed mucosa and to activate production of proinflammatory cytokines (Harris et al., 1996). Moreover, urease (including subunit proteins UreA and UreB) is one of the main antigens recognized by the human immune response to H. pylori, and UreB seems to be more protective than UreA (Ferrero et al., 1994). Urease has been used in vaccination trials to prevent infection with H. pylori in mice (Del Giudice et al., 2001). Both oral and systemic immunizations were considered. The use of oral routes for immunization against infective diseases is desirable because oral vaccines are easier to administer and have higher compliance rates, and mucosal surfaces are the portals of entry for many pathogenic microbial agents. To render the vaccine effective, oral immunization requires the use of mucosal adjuvants, such as the cholera toxin or Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). However, these are used only in animal models because of their toxicity. Several nontoxic derivatives were developed, with LTK63 and LTR72 being the most promising ones (Rappuoli et al., 1999), although their safety for humans is still being investigated.",

The risk of infection is low, which is advantageous, particularly for children, the elderly or immunocompromised individuals. In addition, as mucosal delivery vehicles, recombinant bacterial vaccine vectors offer several practical advantages, including avoidance of culturing large quantities of pathogens, no need to purify antigenic components or subunits and the ability to express immunogens in their native conformation.",

Because L. lactis does not naturally colonize the intestines of humans or animals, it is perhaps more analogous to inert microparticle vaccine-delivery systems (Wells et al., 1996). To date, several bacterial and viral antigens have already been produced in L. lactis (Wells et al., 1993; Que et al., 2000; Enouf et al., 2001; Ribeiro et al., 2002; Dieye et al., 2003; Pei et al., 2005), and immunization with these strains elicits immune responses specific to heterologous antigens (Robinson et al., 1997, 2004; Xin et al., 2003; Ramasamy et al., 2006; Bahey-El-Din et al., 2008). Note that a protective immune response depends not only on the antigen and the delivery vehicle but also on the location of the antigen (Norton et al., 1996). In some cases, antigen export may be of interest because it allows a direct contact between the antigen and the immune system (Ribeiro et al., 2002; Dieye et al., 2003).",

Evidence suggests that the production of antigen-specific secretory IgA is best achieved by presentation of the antigen directly to the mucosal surface (Lamm, 1997). Lactococcus lactis has been described previously as an effective mucosal antigen-delivery system. Mucosal vaccination with recombinant L. lactis strains expressing CRR-produced CRR-specific salivary IgA and serum IgG, prevented pharyngeal infection with Streptococcus pyogenes and promoted survival (Mannam et al., 2004). Using a constitutive strain expressing TTFC, Robinson (2004) demonstrated that intragastric or intranasal administration induced elevated TTFC-specific IgA levels at several mucosal sites and a TTFC-specific T-cell response with a mixed profile of T-helper subset-associated cytokines in the intestine. The present study shows that L. lactis has the potential to act as an effective mucosal delivery system for UreB. The plasmids used for secretory expression of UreB in this system provide a useful model for exploring the characteristics of this vaccine delivery system. However, before recombination LAB can be used in humans, it will be necessary to construct strains for human or animal use that will meet the safety requirements of the regulatory bodies. The existing food-grade expression systems should be further developed for this purpose.",
