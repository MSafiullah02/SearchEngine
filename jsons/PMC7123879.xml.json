From the beginning of medical education when students first lay eyes on cadavers through their later years as seasoned physicians, the very nature of medicine is to come closer to death and serious injury than the rest of society. Physicians also experience traumatic events such as workplace violence at rates higher than most occupations. When natural and man-made disasters occur, hospitals and physicians bear the brunt of caring for those injured and sickened. Significant literature exists on the impact of traumatic events and disaster on individuals and populations. Evidence suggests that physicians experience witnessing injury and death differently and employ different methods of coping. Strategies to mitigate stress and distress due to work-associated trauma should take into account these differences. For this reason, any discussion of physician health and mental well-being must include how physicians experience traumatic events and their immediate and persisting effects.",

Medical and other literature liberally use the terms trauma and traumatized to describe a broad range of stressful life events including traumatic events, stressors, and adversity. More significantly, there is a tendency to blur the boundary between events and reactions. From a diagnostic and research perspective, it is useful to be more precise and circumscribed in defining trauma. Trauma, derived from the Greek word meaning \u201cwound,\u201d in its simplest definition is a physical or mental injury. The diagnostic criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) describe traumatic events as exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence through direct experience, witnessing, or repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details (DSM-5, 2013). Traumatic events are defined by these characteristics, whether or not the individual goes on to develop symptoms. Traumatic stress refers to the range of distress responses, health risk behaviors, and psychiatric disorders that can occur in response to traumatic events. Stressors are defined as external stimuli that disrupt the equilibrium of an individual. Adversity refers to longer-term, sociological and community-based negative stressors that affect individuals or groups. For the purposes of this chapter we will discuss a broad range of stressors and adversity that lead to psychological responses, most of them will be traumatic events.",

Research indicates many students experience anxiety during dissections (Grochowski et al. 2014), but gradually accommodate to being around cadavers, with decreasing rates of symptoms such as intrusive imagery between the first and second semesters of medical school (Bob et al. 2014). Other aspects of medical education can generate distress in students and are worth noting.

In a survey of 113 surgeons, one in five reported symptoms consistent with a PTSD diagnosis, and two-thirds exhibited some symptoms. This was independent of the amount of exposure to surgical trauma patients (Warren et al. 2013). Oncologists experience the death of patients on a frequent basis as a traumatic event. In his book The Emperor of all Maladies, Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee captured his experience of this by writing, \u201cIn the parking lot of the hospital, a chilly, concrete box lit by neon floodlights, I spent the end of every evening and the end of rounds in stunned incoherence, the car radio crackling vacantly in the background, as I compulsively tried to reconstruct the events of the day. The stories of my patients consumed me, and the decisions that I made haunted me\u201d (Mukherjee 2011). In this environment, some individuals develop coping mechanisms that ultimately reduce their experience of distress. However, coping mechanisms that involve numbing, avoidance, or shutting off emotions can result in decreased empathy, potentially impairing a physician\u2019s ability to provide adequate patient care (McFarland and Roth 2016).",

Identification with those who have been severely harmed (\u201cthat could have been me\u201d) increases risk for adverse psychological symptoms (Herberman Mash et al. 2016). Having children of their own contributed to this effect. Psychiatrists face the particularly challenging traumatic event of patient suicide. In a 15-year survey of Canadian psychiatrists and trainees, half experienced a patient suicide. Of those who experienced a patient suicide, 60% did so by the end of their first year of training (Ruskin et al. 2004).",

            "text": "Another potential traumatic event for any physician results from action or inaction in their daily work that results in harm to patients\u2014medical errors and complications. Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States (Makary and Daniel 2016) and have the potential to occur in every specialty and every setting. The term \u201csecond victim\u201d has been used to describe physicians involved in medical errors and complications (Wu 2000). Scott et al. performed an in-depth analysis of 31 \u201csecond victim\u201d physicians who indicated developing symptoms consistent with PTSD. These physicians recalled distressing aspects of the event in extraordinary detail many years later, reported ruminative thoughts about the event that adversely affected work and sleep, and experienced abrupt emotional recollection of the event when confronted by triggers such as a patient with a similar name or performing the same procedure in the same location (Scott et al. 2009). A study of critical care personnel who committed medical errors identified symptoms of guilt (53.8%), shame (42.5%), and anxious rumination (37.5%) (Laurent et al. 2014). Other symptoms following medical errors include anxiety about future potential errors (52%), loss of confidence in abilities as a physician (45%), and sleep disruption (36%) (McLennan et al. 2015). Surgical disciplines experience similar rates, with 53% of surgeons reporting an adverse patient event in the last year as a traumatic event (Hu et al. 2012). Malpractice cases can be another source of continuing stress with 25% of 7164 surgeons reporting a lawsuit within the past 24 months, which was associated with burnout, depression, and suicidal thoughts (Balch et al. 2011). In an effort to cope, physicians may turn to risky behaviors. In a 1991 survey, Wenokur and colleagues identified increased alcohol use among 11% of physicians sued for malpractice. Fifty-four percent of the affected physicians considered their ability to care for patients compromised but only 6% sought any type of mental health treatment (Wenokur and Campbell 1991).",

With water chest-deep and rising, he began to seriously worry about his wife, who was 7 months pregnant and had spent the past 72 h in the hospital with him. He decided to leave and wade the waters, challenging the conditions of the streets and the violence outside of the hospital. He walked in waist- to chest-deep water with his wife and carrying his dog until he reached dry ground about 2 miles away. From there, he walked 5 more miles to his apartment uptown. On arrival, his heart sank: his vehicle was smashed under a large tree and was unusable. In the haste of the moment, he let himself through the broken window of a neighbor\u2019s house. He looked around and found a spare key to his neighbor\u2019s truck parked outside, took it, and drove himself and his wife to safety in a nearby state (Raggi and Raggi 2005).",

United States hospitals and nursing care facilities have higher than average rates of nonfatal workplace injuries (BLS 2016). Physicians throughout the international healthcare community also experience workplace violence. A variety of social, cultural, and economic changes in the delivery of healthcare parallel increased rates of violence toward physicians (Shi et al. 2015; WHO 2002). Among Pakistani physicians surveyed about their experiences over the past 12 months, one in six reported a physical attack and 60% reported verbal abuse. Among those, 40% screened positive for anxiety and depression on the Global Health Questionnaire-12 and one in six were positive for PTSD using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian, with physical attacks being the most significant predictor of PTSD (Zafar et al. 2016). Studies looking at workplace violence to date have been directed toward quantifying the problem and less directed to understanding the sources and underlying risks (Phillips 2016). Table 2.2 summarizes a useful differentiation of types of workplace violence according to the relationships between the perpetrator, the workplace, and the victim. Violence in the workplace occurs along a spectrum from verbal harassment to direct threats of violence, threatening with a weapon, physical assault, and homicide.\n",

Verbal violence can range from insulting or demeaning remarks directed toward a healthcare worker to direct threats of physical violence. Physical violence occurs along a spectrum ranging from unwanted contact or striking by patients to physically injurious assault to homicide. Psychiatry specialists and emergency medicine physicians are most likely to be victims of workplace violence. A sample of emergency room workers in 2007 showed that nurses, physicians, and support personnel were threatened with violence three times per year and physically assaulted once per year (Kowalenko et al. 2013). In a 2011 study of U.S. emergency medicine residents and staff, 78% of emergency physicians reported some type of workplace violence in the last year. Of these events, 75% involved verbal threats, and 21% involved physical assault by a patient (Behnam et al. 2011). Commonly cited causes of violence in healthcare settings include delays in consultations and/or care, intoxication, and psychiatric disorders (Belayachi et al. 2010). Though patient-initiated violence is the most often researched in emergency settings, some literature suggests rates of violence by patients\u2019 relatives may be even higher (Ayranci 2005).",

Acts of mass violence such as mass shootings, terrorist bombings, or other large scale attacks incorporate multiple characteristics that amplify their psychological impact. First, they are intentional acts which have a greater traumatic impact compared to natural or random events. Second, multiple victims will increase the number of individual traumatic events. Finally, victims tend to be innocent bystanders and therefore perceived by responders with greater identification and horror. Emergency physicians, trauma surgeons, and orthopedic surgeons describe caring for mass shooting victims as \u201cjust like any normal day at a trauma center, but amplified\u201d and often struggle with compartmentalized emotions for years (Castellucci 2016). Recent mass shootings both in and out of healthcare settings have captured public attention and generated significant anxiety and fear. Between 1980 and 1990, there were 78 workplace homicides by firearm, and 19 of these were physicians (Goodman et al. 1994). Kelen and colleagues reviewed media reporting of hospital shooting events between 2000 and 2011 and identified 154 hospital-related shootings, of which 91 occurred inside the hospital. Motives for shooting varied, including grudge (27%), suicide (21%), and euthanizing an ill relative (14%). In 45% of hospital shootings, the victim was the perpetrator, either self-inflicted or shot by security response (Kelen et al. 2012).",

Individuals most directly exposed are at greatest risk for psychiatric disorders after the trauma. In the disaster literature, the directly exposed group usually includes individuals most proximal to the disaster (North et al. 2002), those who experienced physical danger, and those who directly witnessed traumatic events. In addition, individuals who have attachments with primary victims, first responders, and support providers are at greater risk (Wright and Bartone 1994) than \u201cdetached\u201d bystanders. It is reasonable to extrapolate this to all traumatic events experienced by physicians, meaning that those closest to the scene and those with more emotional attachment to victims are more likely to experience traumatic stress reactions. Those who are injured during a traumatic event will typically experience more symptoms of traumatic stress. Gender plays a role, with men more likely to experience traumatic events, but women more likely to develop PTSD (Breslau et al. 1999).",

However, other studies of medical students in the USA and other countries have found reported rates to be much higher (Frank et al. 2006; Rautio et al. 2005). A recent study found that 64 and 76% of medical students reported at least one incident of mistreatment by faculty and residents, respectively (Cook et al. 2014).",

As mentioned previously, gross anatomy teaching requires exposure to and dissection of deceased human remains. It is traditionally viewed as a right-of-passage and a milestone by which preclinical students begin the process of transitioning from layperson to physician by crossing the boundary of the human body. The dissection experience produces distress in about half of medical students (Sandor et al. 2015). Fear of stigmatization and being perceived as unfit to serve as a physician prevent many students from talking about these reactions. During the dissection experience, identification with human remains (i.e., \u201cthis could be my grandmother\u201d) increases distress. Seeing the hands and face of the cadaver increases this effect. Exposing students to the least distressing body parts first and teaching students cognitive coping strategies may reduce adverse effects. Normalizing a range of emotional and physiologic reactions during dissection and encouraging open discussion of these reduces stigma and barriers to help seeking and promotes healthy peer interactions that become useful later in their medical careers.",

In this way, leaders can provide the initial support to physicians impacted by traumatic events, a critical element in reducing distress and promoting recovery (Brewin et al. 2000). Another key aspect of this communication is that leaders convey to their organization that distress reactions are acceptable and that the group can and will support members through their distress. Leaders must also pay attention to their own distress reactions and health risk behaviors following traumatic events.

Any additional stressor can exacerbate the primary traumatic event, adding to a physician\u2019s burden of distress. Individuals will predominantly manifest distress reactions, health risk behaviors, and less frequently psychiatric disorders (see Fig. 2.1). A focus exclusively on making a psychiatric diagnosis will often overlook a range of psychological and behavioral responses contributing to significant distress and functional impairment. Assessment can include a clinical interview as well as the use of standardized scales for trauma and comorbid illnesses (i.e., PTSD Checklist -Civilian Version, PHQ9 for depression, and AUDIT-C for alcohol consumption). Another consideration when assessing physicians following traumatic events should be a clear understanding of the intensity and duration of the physician\u2019s exposure to traumatic events. Knowing such details as the number of injuries treated, time spent stabilizing patients, and the nature of their injuries can provide clues as to the likelihood of a distress response down the road even if the physician reports no acute distress.

Though PFA has not been well studied in response to physician work trauma specifically, these principles have strong expert consensus as the most effective interventions following psychological trauma (Hobfoll et al. 2007). The utility of PFA principles can reasonably be extrapolated to the physician population and serve as an important evidence-based guide to developing appropriate interventions. There are five essential elements to PFA. (1) Promoting safety is established by removing individuals from immediately traumatic experiences and protecting them from secondary traumatization. (2) Calming involves reducing arousal symptoms through relaxation techniques as well as providing information about assessment and management of the traumatic experience. (3) Self-efficacy enables traumatized physicians to identify ways they can mitigate stress reactions and take a proactive role in their recovery from trauma. (4) Connectedness reinforces existing social support networks and helps the physician build additional systems of support (colleagues, supervisors, others outside the work environment) where appropriate.

Another benefit of self-help interventions is that distressed physicians can utilize these resources without risking stigmatization through seeking formal care. These interventions can be used in conjunction with psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or complementary and alternative treatments.",

Elements of formal peer support programs include preparing clinician peer supporters through a structured training program, matching appropriate peers (e.g., a surgeon helping another surgeon in distress), and ensuring confidentiality of communications (Shapiro and Galowitz 2016).",

Other therapeutic interventions, such as Stress Inoculation Training and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing have also been found to be helpful in reducing symptoms of trauma. Trauma-focused psychotherapies incorporate imaginal exposure to the traumatic event in conjunction with an examination of cognitions the physician may have about aspects of the event and their meaning. Negative thoughts such as \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault,\u201d \u201cIf only I hadn\u2019t said something then this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d and other distorted cognitions are examined in collaboration between the physician and their treating provider. Subsequently, alternative and more balanced thoughts are considered and eventually used to replace the distressing negative thoughts. Trauma-focused psychotherapies also incorporate real-world behavioral interventions to assist patients in overcoming avoidant behaviors. These psychotherapies reduce the full range of symptoms associated with disorders such as PTSD. They have also been found to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of early symptoms if delivered shortly after the trauma and prior to the development of a formal psychiatric disorder.",

Because regulating sleep is critical to reducing arousal symptoms (and promoting the \u201ccalming\u201d element of PFA), short-term sedative-hypnotic medication may be used to relieve insomnia. Eszopiclone (Lunesta) and Zolpidem (Ambien), both of which enhance GABA activity, are commonly prescribed for initiation insomnia. Prazosin (Minipress), an alpha-adrenergic blocker has demonstrated efficacy in treating insomnia associated with posttraumatic symptoms as well as reducing the frequency and severity of associated nightmares and may be used at doses up to 15 mg nightly. Physicians with comorbid depression may benefit from the sedating histamine properties of trazodone (Oleptro), originally developed as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of depression. Medication for sleep should be provided in conjunction with additional interventions to promote sleep hygiene and address the range of PFA principles. As with all interventions medication should be tailored to patient preference.",

These interventions are increasingly sought out by patients as alternatives to traditional biological interventions. Patients commonly report a desire for options that enhance self-efficacy and reduce the incidence of side effects as a rationale for using these modalities. Mindfulness practices have the most robust research base to support their efficacy. Mindfulness is the practice of purposefully focusing on what is happening in the present moment without passing judgment. It requires one to attend to thoughts, feelings, or sensations without resisting or trying to change them. This practice has generated increasing attention in the field of healthcare as an intervention to reduce the stress and anxiety linked to a variety of adverse health outcomes. Animal-assisted therapy has become increasingly popular in the management of a range of psychiatric symptoms, including those associated with traumatic stress as well as anxiety and other disorders. Animals may assist individuals who would otherwise be reluctant to engage in social activities following a traumatic event; thus, enhancing the critical treatment intervention of social support. Yoga, meditation, and acupuncture are additional alternatives that should be considered. Patient preference is an important determinant in considering whether to offer interventions currently considered complementary and alternative.",
