Infectious etiologies include bacteria, viruses, atypical organisms, fungi, and parasites. The exact infectious etiology of the pneumonia is often not known because this would require an invasive procedure to obtain a specimen for culture. Without a culture, other clinical features and diagnostic study results are used to help make a clinical diagnosis and to guide appropriate therapy. The most commonly reported viral causes are biased due to available testing, but include influenza A or B, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza. In the post-pneumococcal vaccine era in the United States, increased rates of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia during the respiratory viral infection season has been reported in association with RSV, influenza, adenovirus and hMPV.

In 2008, pneumonia accounted for 14% of deaths in infants less than 28 days of life according to the WHO.

This is the sound of alveoli opening and/or by air bubbling through fluid in the small airways during inspiration.

Pneumonia caused by Staphylococci in the pediatric population may be associated with pneumatoceles, bronchopleural fistulas, and empyema, although none of these should be considered pathognomonic. Mycoplasma pneumonia usually has a diffuse bilateral interstitial appearance on radiograph, although it can also be seen with lower lobe consolidations and effusions. The preferred imaging is for two views of the chest, frontal (usually posteroanterior), and lateral (to see the retrocardiac area) for initial evaluation.

Non-pulmonary considerations include leukemic infiltrates, congestive heart failure, metabolic acidosis with compensatory tachypnea, asthma, or in appropriate areas malaria. Failure to improve as expected with usual therapy should trigger consideration of both uncommon infectious organisms as well as underlying condition such as HIV or pulmonary anatomic abnormality. Recurrent pneumonia bears a further work-up, depending on the associated signs and symptoms. Underlying diagnoses to consider include: cystic fibrosis, congenital malformations (cystic adenomatoid malformations, pulmonary sequestrations, foregut duplication cysts), immotile cilia syndrome, right middle lobe syndrome, immunodeficiency (congenital or acquired), hemorrhage, vascular malformations, and dysfunctional swallow.

Pulse oximetry should be performed on all hospitalized children. Antibiotics will be given empirically despite the fact that this approach likely leads to overuse of antibiotics in the general population. Antibiotic choice is typically based on the patient's age and commonly encountered organisms causing infection in that age. It is important to remember that for neonates, early-onset GBS disease is usually severe and almost always includes pneumonia as part of the disease presentation. Treatment of suspected or proven viral pneumonia is typically supportive.
