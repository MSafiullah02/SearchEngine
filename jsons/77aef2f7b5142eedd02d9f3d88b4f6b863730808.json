Standpoints among experts were then initially discordant, spanning from those who claimed that the illness was little more than the flu to those who advised it was a very dangerous disease. However, after 3 days, the number of cases increased to 221 and then up to 1337 on the 1st of March. A few weeks later, on March 21 there were 53,578 cases with 4825 deaths. From the very beginning, Lombardy has been the most affected region in Italy. As a matter of fact, in March 2020, the region of Lombardy (Italy's most populated region, accounting for 10,060,574 inhabitants) has found itself overwhelmed by the epidemic, initially quite unaware of the dramatic extent of this outbreak.",

The aim was to shift subspecialty ICU facilities and anesthesiologists to the care of COVID-19 patients. To this end, the regional government asked us to estimate the number of true neurosurgical emergency procedures and of nondeferrable elective ones for a foreseeable period of 2 months. From a quick survey of historical data from all neurosurgery departments in Lombardy, the estimated number of surgical emergencies was ranging between 80 and 100 per week for the entire region, 40 to 50 of whom were concentrated within the Milan metropolitan area. Approximately the same number of procedures was estimated for nondeferrable elective cases, mostly tumors.",

Thanks to the cooperation and collaboration of more than 20 neurosurgeons from spoke hospitals and also some spine orthopedic surgeons, the number of on-duty neurosurgeons at hub hospitals was doubled. In addition, at each hub hospital, one on-call service of complex spinal surgery and one of vascular surgery are set up.",

This was mainly related to people being confined to their homes and a decrease in activities, leading to a significant reduction in trauma. Intriguingly, we also observed a reduction in subarachnoid hemorrhages (despite the change of season) and strokes, which hardly finds a straight explanation. So far, 15 COVID-19-positive patients have undergone surgery. Of these patients, 9 had a regular course, 5 patients died, and 1 patient is in critical condition, all because of pulmonary complications. When performing surgery on COVID-19 patients, all operators are required to protect themselves with double gloves, double surgical gowns, surgical N95 respirator masks, and disposable face shields. All surgeries on COVID-19 patients are conducted inside specifically dedicated operating rooms, and the patients are admitted to dedicated ICUs or dedicated wards depending on their status.",

A patient waitlist was created that included exclusively nondeferrable tumor cases. Patients were categorized according to the severity of their illness into 3 classes: A++, A+, and A. \"A++\" includes patients requiring immediate surgical treatment as in the case of rapidly increasing intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, and symptomatic medullary compression. \"A+\" refers to patients who require surgery within 7 to 10 days as for intracranial tumors with relevant mass effect and/or progressive neurological deficits. \"A\" encompasses patients with tumors causing neurological deficits and/or suspicion of malignant nature. This class owns the lower level of urgency requiring treatment within 1 month. A++ cases are performed at one of the 3 hubs with an emergency department or, in selected cases, at the spoke's site whenever possible. In contrast, A+ and A patients are referred to the neurooncological hub through an inter-institutional board reviewing process. Eligible patients are then scheduled at the neurooncological hub based on the urgency and availability of both the operating room slots and the referring surgical team. Due to the necessity to keep the neurooncological hub virus free, each patient undergoes additional screenings, namely, measurements of body temperature, O 2 saturation, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and transaminases; chest radiography; pharyngeal COVID swab; and a comprehensive interview focusing on COVID-19. In our experience, the presented scheme has proven highly effective. Tellingly, at the end of the 2nd operational week, 65 patients affected by highly complex, nondeferrable tumors were successfully operated on by both institutional and noninstitutional surgical teams at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico.",
