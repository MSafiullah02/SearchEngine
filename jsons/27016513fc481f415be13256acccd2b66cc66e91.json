Symptoms range from cough without sputum to an illness characterised by expectoration of mucopurulent sputum, fever, general malaise and dyspnoea. Therefore, although the terms acute bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), common cold and chest infection are used in a clinical context to define separate disease entities, they represent a range of respiratory tract infections whose symptoms, causative agents and resolution vary. This review will consider the diagnosis and treatment of common URTIs. The fourth National Morbidity Survey in the UK found that the overall consultation rate for acute URTI was 772 per 10 000 person years at risk. 1",

Vaccination Influenza vaccination reduces the occurrence of acute otitis in young children while the virus is circulating in the community, but does not have an effect during the remainder of the year. 16 Evidence of the ability of a bacterial vaccine to prevent acute otitis media, on the other hand, is not as promising. In two trials, immunisation of infants up to the age of two years with a seven-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (CRM197) was not very effective in preventing acute otitis during an 18month follow-up. 6, 17 However, it is highly effective in reducing the prevalence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the seven serotypes included in the vaccine.",
