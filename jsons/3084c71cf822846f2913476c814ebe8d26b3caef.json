            "text": "CD8 + T cells are considered to be critical in tumor surveillance and elimination. Increased CD8 + T cell frequency and function is associated with better prognosis in cancer patients. Interleukin 10 is a cytokine with controversial roles in CD8 + T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. We therefore examined the interleukin 10 expression and consumption in CD8 + T cells harvested from the peripheral blood and resected tumors of gastric cancer patients of stages II-IV. We found that the gastric cancer patients presented significantly elevated frequencies of interleukin 10-expressing cells in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells compared to healthy controls. But distinctive from the interleukin 10-expressing CD4 + T cells, which increased in frequency in advanced cancer, the interleukin 10-expressing CD8 + T cells did not increase with cancer stage in the peripheral blood and actually decreased with cancer stage in resected tumor. Interleukin 10 and interleukin 10 receptor expression was also enriched in interferon gamma-expressing activated CD8 + T cells. Compared to interleukin 10-nonexpressing CD8 + T cells, interleukin 10 receptor-expressing CD8 + T cells secreted significantly elevated interferon gamma levels. Treatment of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated, purified CD8 + T cells with interleukin 10 alone could significantly enhance CD8 + T cell survival, an effect dependent on interleukin 10 receptor expression. Interleukin 10 also increased CD8 + T cell proliferation synergistically with interferon gamma but not alone. Analysis of downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription molecules showed that interleukin 10 treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 to lesser extent. Together, these results demonstrate that interleukin 10 possessed stimulatory roles in activated CD8 + T cells from gastric cancer patients.",

            "text": "Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is generally characterized as an anti-inflammatory cytokine for its role in mediating tissue protection during autoimmune disorders and chronic inflammations. 1,2 IL-10 treatment decreases the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and costimulatory molecules and promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). 3 These IL-10-induced changes in APCs can limit the magnitude of T cell responses and prevent excessive T cell responses. Exogenous IL-10 can also directly inhibit human CD4 + T cell responses in vitro, resulting in reduced cytokine expression and proliferation. [4] [5] [6] These findings seem to suggest that in CD8 + T cells, IL-10 also exert an inhibitory role. However, several recent findings have demonstrated that IL-10 might promote tumor immunity, especially with regard to CD8 + T cell-mediated immune surveillance. 7 In mice, Fujii et al. 8 showed that IL-10 injection increased the number of CD8 + CD44 hi CD122 + T cells and enhanced the antigen-specific proliferation. Mumm et al. 9 demonstrated that host or exogenous pegylated IL-10 significantly increased the presence of CD8 + T cells in spontaneous and large transplanted tumors. IL-10 expression also correlated with the level of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), granzymes, and MHC expression in the microenvironment of human tumors. Emmerich et al. 10 further demonstrated that IL-10 induced the expansion tumor-resident CD8 + T cells and activated their IFN-\u03b3 production. These results were corroborated by the related finding that IL-10 could act as a chemoattractant to CD8 + T cells, 11 could activate cytotoxic T cell activity, 12, 13 and could increase the maturation of CD8 + T memory cells. 14 Together, these studies suggest that IL-10 is an integral part of CD8 + T cellmediated anti-tumor immunity.",

We therefore focused on the effect of IL-10 production and consumption in CD8 + T cells. Intracellular IFN-\u03b3 expression is frequently used as a marker of CD8 + T cell activation. Interestingly, in stages III and IV patients, the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-expressing cells was significantly higher in IL-10expressing CD8 + T cells than in IL-10-nonexpressing CD8 + T cells, suggesting that IL-10 marked a group of activated CD8 + T cells (Figure 3(a) ). No such result was observed in healthy controls or stage II patients. To confirm this finding, we utilized the previous finding that IL-10-expressing T cells expressed higher IL-10R than IL-10-nonexpressing T cells and enriched IL-10expressing CD8 + T cells by IL-10R sorting. The IL-10R + and IL-10R \u2212 CD8 + T cells were then cultured at the same cell density separately for 12 h. Higher IL-10 secretion by IL-10R + CD8 + T cells was confirmed by ELISA ( Figure  3(b) ).

We first discovered that the IL-10 expression pattern was different between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Compared to healthy controls, gastric cancer patients demonstrated upregulated levels of IL-10 expression in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from PBMCs. In circulating CD4 + T cells, the frequency of IL-10-expressing cells was higher in stage IV than in stage II patients. Such a trend was not observed in circulating CD8 + T cells. The frequency of IL-10-expressing tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells in stage III and stage IV patients, however, was significantly lower than that in stage II patients. At present, the underlying mechanism inducing these differences among patients at different cancer stages is not entirely clear. One possible explanation is that since IL-10 marked a group of activated IFN-\u03b3-expressing CD8 + T cells, the expression of these two cytokines was possibly associated with each other. Reduction in IL-10 expression in later stage gastric cancer patients could be related to reduction in CD8 + T cell activation.",

            "text": "cytotoxic molecules. Other studies have demonstrated that IL-10 expressed by CD4 + T cells and APCs, such as M2 macrophages and regulatory B cells, could suppress proinflammatory cytokine production by CD8 + T cells. 26 One crucial difference between their studies and ours is that the APCs were present in the coculture with CD8 + T cells in their studies, while we used plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 to stimulate purified CD8 + T cells. Therefore, one possible mechanism that resulted in these contrasting observations is that IL-10 possibly exerted inhibitory effects through modulating the functions of APCs, such as by reducing MHC class II expression and downregulating costimulatory molecules, but did not directly downplay CD8 + T cell activation in the absence of APCs. These discrepancies also suggest that the pleiotropic roles of IL-10 might present clinical difficulties if IL-10 is used as a therapeutic. Indeed, previous studies have shown that higher M2 macrophage (low IL-12, high IL-10) frequency was associated with worse gastric cancer prognosis. 27 We also demonstrated that IL-10 treatment strongly elevated the phosphorylation of STAT3 and somewhat increased the phosphorylation of STAT1. Interestingly, the activation of STAT3 and STAT1 pathways can result in opposing effects in proliferation and immune regulation. STAT3 promotes the proliferation and survival of many cell types, including tumor cells. STAT1; however, promotes innate and adaptive immune responses and activates proapoptiotic and anti-proliferative genes. Exactly how STAT3/STAT1 activation resulted in the IL-10mediated effects in CD8 + T cells is currently unclear. Concurrent activation of STAT1 and STAT3 can also be mediated by IL-21 and IL-27, which were known to mediate anti-tumor effects. Therefore, the combined effects of STAT1 and STAT3 activation in CD8 + T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity need further investigation.",

            "text": "There were also several limitations in this study. First, only patients who were qualified to undergo tumor resection were included in the analyses of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells, which limited the number of patients being included. Second, the amount of TILs was limited; as a result, functional analyses of IL-10 were performed using CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from PBMCs, which might not behave in the same fashion as tumor-infiltrating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Third, it is yet unclear whether IL-10 in vivo could promote antitumor CD8 + T cell responses in gastric cancer patients and whether IL-10-treated CD8 + T cells were more proficient at eliminating gastric cancer. These issues need to be further examined before incorporating IL-10 in tumor immunotherapies. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were stimulated with PMA + ionomycin for 5 h with brefeldin A before intracellular staining. (c) Isolated CD8 + T cells were cultured at 10 5 cells per mL with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28.
