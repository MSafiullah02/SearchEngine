On January 27, 2020, a brother of the leader of this religious group was hospitalized in Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo, a town which is 27 km from Daegu. His brother died on January 31, and they had a funeral ceremony for two nights and three days from January 31 to February 2 in a hospital funeral home located in Daenam Hospital. Because this was the funeral service of the leader's family, many members (about 170) of the religious group visited the hospital funeral home for 3 days. A 61-year-old woman from this religious group who visited the funeral was later confirmed with COVID-9 on February 23. Of note, she lived in Daegu and occasionally commuted to Seoul. Tracing her movements, KCDC found that she attended two worship services at the Shincheonji Church in Daegu with at least 1,000 other members of her religious group.",

A total of 302 were identified as his contacts and out of 262 patients he transported, 187 patients have already discharged from the hospital and 75 patients were still in the hospital. 7 As a result, the hospital has been closed and 14 additional patients were confirmed from this hospital as of March 2, 2020.
