            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of viral disease in swine that is endemic in swine producing regions throughout the world resulting in severe economic losses in affected areas. The disease is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and gilts and respiratory distress in pigs of all ages [1-3]. PRRSV is an enveloped virus containing single-stranded positive-sense RNA as the genome. Its genome is 14.5 kb in length and is composed of nine open reading frames (ORFs; ORF 1a, ORF 1b, ORF 2a, ORF 2b, ORF 3, ORF 4, ORF 5, ORF 6 and ORF 7) flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) [4,5]. PRRSV belongs to the family Arteriviridae, grouped together with the Coronaviridae and Roniviridae in the order Nidovirales [6-8]. Other members in the family Arteriviridae include equine arteritis virus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus [9].",

            "text": "PRRSV has a restricted cell tropism in its host (pig). It primarily infects alveolar macrophages although the virus has been detected in macrophages of other tissues like spleen, liver, peyers patches, thymus as well as microglial cells, however peritoneal macrophages are refractory [10,11]. Primary cultures of porcine alveolar macrophages are routinely used for in vitro isolation of PRRSV. Other established cell lines such as MA104 (a monkey kidney cell line) or its derivatives MARC-145 and CL2621 cells are commonly used for its in vitro propagation [2,12]. Several candidate molecules have been identified to be the receptors/co-receptors for PRRSV entry including heparin sulfate and sialoadhesin [13-15]. Our laboratory has demonstrated that PRRSV utilizes vimentin as a receptor in MARC-145 cells [16]. During infection, PRRSV enters the host cells by a receptor-mediated endocytosis through interaction with its receptor(s) and/or co-receptor(s) [17,18]. There are few other cell lines that supports binding of PRRSV but are not permissive to virus infection. Following receptor mediated endocytosis, PRRSV replication proceeds by discontinuous transcription forming a 3'-coterminal nested set of functionally monocistronic mRNA. The common leader sequences in mRNA are joined to the coding sequences by consensus intergenic sequences through the junction sequence UCAACC. The interactions between the leader sequence, the intergenic sequence, and the body of RNA are regulated by cis- and trans-acting elements as well as host cellular factors [4,5,19,20]. In several RNA viruses, the secondary or tertiary structures of 5' and/or 3' UTRs have been reported to be critical for the viral replication process. In this process, host cellular proteins are thought to bind to 3' UTR of viral RNA [8,20-23]. For example, translation elongation factor 1 alpha was found to bind to the 3' UTR RNAs of West Nile virus [24], dengue virus [25], and tobacco mosaic virus [26]. In corona viruses, Mitochondrial heat shock proteins (hsp 40, 60 and 70) were reported to bind to the 3' UTR RNA of murine hepatitis virus in cooperation with mitochondrial aconitase [27,28]. Recently, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was also reported to interact with hepatitis A virus RNA [29]. These studies indicate that host proteins interacting with 3' UTR RNA of viruses play a very important role in viral infection. Previous studies in our laboratory have identified at least 11 MARC-145 cellular proteins that bind to the 3' UTR RNA of PRRSV (Fahad and Kapil, unpublished data). We performed this study with the aim of identifying these cellular proteins interacting with 3' UTR RNA of PRRSV and to study their role in viral infection.",

CD151 is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, which has several cellular functions that include cell signaling, cell activation and platelet aggregation [30-33]. Transfection of CD151 rendered BHK-21, a non-susceptible cell line, susceptible to PRRSV infection. The transfection of siRNA against CD151 inhibited PRRSV infection into MARC-145 cells. Additionally, polyclonal anti-CD151 antibody (Ab) completely blocked PRRSV infection into MARC-145 cells. These results suggest that CD151 plays a critical role in PRRSV infection in vitro.",

Interaction between CD151 and RNA of PRRSV is specific (Gel shift assay) and interaction also occurs in vivo (detection of PRRSV RNA in immunoprecipitation). Another important observation of our study is that CD151 confers PRRSV susceptibility to BHK-21 cells. Previously it has been shown that BHK-21 cells are non-susceptible to PRRSV infection. However these cells when transfected with either PRRSV RNA or infectious cDNA clones, it results in productive infection of PRRSV without spreading to neighbouring cells [19]. The major factor that is lacking in BHK-21 cells that prevent the infection seems to be in entry. Since CD151 is a transmembrane protein, we reasoned that it might function as the entry molecule and performed (co-) immunoprecipitation experiments to determine if there is direct interaction between CD151 and the PRRSV protein. We could not detect any direct interaction between them using (co-) immunoprecipitation and virus overlay protein binding assay (data not shown). Our results are in agreement with role of another tetraspanin molecule CD9 that has been shown to render MDBK cells susceptible to infection by a canine distemper virus (CDV) and predicted that this molecule serves as the entry molecule. However, they also could not demonstrate any direct interaction between CD9 and CDV proteins [40]. Therefore we cannot completely rule out the possibility of interaction between the CD151 and PRRSV proteins leading to helping of virus entry into BHK-21 cells.",

CD151 is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, alternately known as the transmembrane 4 superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of four highly conserved hydrophobic transmembrane domains. CD151 was initially identified as a human platelet surface glycoprotein (platelet endothelial tetraspan antigen-3; PETA-3) by a monoclonal antibody inducing platelet aggregation [43]. CD151 was also independently cloned as SF-HT-activated gene 1 (SFA-1), which was up-regulated in human T cells by transformation with human T-cell-leukemia virus type 1 [44]. We found that CD151 protein is highly conserved across the species examined with high homology between human and simian species and our results are in agreement with previous report [45]. In this study, we examined the expression of CD151 in several cell lines to determine if it is the susceptibility factor in PRRSV infection. CD151 was expressed in all susceptible cell lines namely, MA-104, MARC-145, COS-7 and Vero cells, which are derived from African green monkey kidney. However, CD151 was not expressed in BHK-21 and MDBK cells, which are derived from kidneys of the other species. CD151 has a wide cell and tissue distribution, including platelets, megakaryocytes, activated T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, Schwann cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and muscle cells [43,44,46]. In account of our novel observation of RNA binding activity of CD151, we looked for RNA binding domains on CD151 protein by bioinformatic analysis, we could not find any known RNA binding activity but there were some motifs in second extracellular domain which could be potential RNA binding sites. Current experiments are underway to identify potential RNA binding motifs.",

            "text": "Evidence presented in this study definitely points that CD151 confers susceptibility to PRRSV infection. It is evident when transfection of a CD151 expressing clone into MARC-145 cells increased the susceptibility of MARC cells to PRRSV. Conversely, decreased expression of CD151 by using siRNA also inhibited the susceptibility of MARC-145 cells to PRRSV infection. Furthermore, the antibody against CD151 completely inhibited PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells. These results indicate that CD151 plays very important role in PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells. To this end, only direct interaction between CD151 and PRRSV is that of RNA-protein interaction. How can CD151, a transmembarane protein, by virtue of its binding to PRRSV RNA help in virus infection? PRRSV and other arteriviruses, enter into host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. CD151, by virtue of its expression on the plasma membranes and in intracellular vesicles, like endosomes [33,46], interacts with PRRSV in cooperation with other molecules [13-18]. Even though we could not directly demonstrate the interaction between CD151 and PRRSV protein, we cannot rule if there is any direct interaction between them. Another example of tetraspan molecule promoting viral entry is CD82 and CD81 molecules in case of HTLV-1 virus [47-49], however in this case, binding of CD81 to viral glycoprotein E2 does not correlate with permissiveness of cells to virus infection. This implies that other cellular factors are required for viral infection [47-49]. During endocytosis, lowering of pH in the endosome results in fusion event between viral envelope and endosome [18] possibly involving CD151. Another role of CD151 by virtue of RNA binding ability is possibly in localization of ribonucleoprotein complexes to the site of viral replication [21,41] that has been demonstrated to promote viral replication.",
