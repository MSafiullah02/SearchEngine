            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) cause vasodilation by inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II and ACEIs comprise a critical class of antihypertensive medication indicated for heart failure, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, proteinuria, diabetic nephropathy and postmyocardial infarction [1,2]. Safety concerns regarding the use of ACEIs have been raised, especially their cancer risk [3,4,5]. Hicks et al. reported that the use of ACEIs is associated with a 1.14-fold higher risk of lung cancer compared with the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) [6]. However, the latest meta-analysis conducted by Bahaj et al. concluded that no significant association exists between ACEI use and the development of lung cancer [7]. Therefore, the association between ACEIs and lung cancer remains unclear [4,6,7,8,9,10]. Possible reasons for the discrepancies among these studies might be the baseline bias of other comorbidities, insufficient follow-up, confounding effects of other antihypertensive medications and inadequate selection of the control cohort [4,6,9,10,11,12].",

When determining the hazardous effects of drugs on lung cancer risk in the real-world setting, exposure to air pollutants should be considered a confounding factor. Furthermore, the variant of insertion or deletion in the ACE gene is significantly different between Asian and Caucasian populations [15]. Hicks et al. reported an association between ACEI use and lung cancer but their study participants were mostly Caucasian. Chiang et al. indicated that ACEI and ARB use is not associated with all-cancer risk in the Taiwanese population [16]. However, the results of Chiang et al. cannot be used to establish whether Asian ACEI users have a higher lung cancer risk because that study had a relatively short follow-up period for cancer latency, did not consider other antihypertensive medications and did not specify lung cancer as a study outcome [16]. Direct evidence of lung cancer risk in Asian ACEI users is lacking. Therefore, we combined data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Database (TAQMD) to conduct a propensity score-matched cohort study to determine lung cancer risk in Asian ACEI users.",

We conducted this population-based retrospective cohort study using data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID), a subset constructed from original registration files and original claims data in the NHIRD. The LHID contains the data of one million enrollees randomly sampled individuals from the NHIRD. Diagnoses were coded with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes. The NHIRD ensures the encryption of patient information; therefore, informed consent is not required. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of China Medical University (CMUH104-REC2-115[CR-4]). We also used the TAQMD for obtaining information on the air pollutants PM2.5, PM10 and SO2.

The age, PM2.5 \u03bcg/m3 daily average, PM10 \u03bcg/m3 daily average and SO2 ppb daily average distribution is not Gaussian/normal distribution. Therefore, we used nonparametric statistics (Mann-Whitney U test) to test age, PM2.5 \u03bcg/m3 daily average, PM10 \u03bcg/m3 daily average and SO2 ppb daily average differences between both cohorts. We classified monthly income and urbanization into three and four levels, respectively. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of lung cancer occurrence and the results were further analyzed according to the various dose\u2013response categories. Covariables listed in the Table 1 were included in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model. We further analyzed the dose\u2013response effect among patients using ACEI or ARB. We calculated the average days, average dose and average DDD (defined daily dosages) of ACEI and ARB per year by dividing the total used days or total prescribed dose by the follow-up period. We classified the patients into two subgroups by median. We measured the cumulative incidence of lung cancer in the ACEI and ARB cohorts using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and we assessed the curve difference using the log-rank test.

Use of ACEIs could result in increased levels of bradykinin in the lungs, which are normally degraded by ACEIs. This may mediate the sensitization of the airway and enhance the cough reflex [18]. Furthermore, bradykinin is associated with the regulation of neointimal formation and mitogenesis through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway [19,20,21]. Chee et al. indicated that bradykinin receptors are highly expressed in the cytoplasm of all types of lung tumors, [22]. which would mediate proangiogenic properties and cancer migration, invasion and metastasis [23]. In addition, ACEI use could cause the accumulation of substance P in the lung. Esteban et al. reported that the activation of neurokinin-1 receptors through substance P is one mechanism linking mitogenesis and cancer promotion and progression [24]. Munoz et al. indicated that substance P may induce the proliferation of both tumor cells and endothelial cells, thus stimulating angiogenesis [25]. Therefore, increased levels of substance P and bradykinin in the lungs may be the mechanism through which ACEI users are at a higher risk of lung cancer. The duration\u2013response and dose\u2013response relationships between ACEI use and lung cancer further strengthen our clinical findings.",

Bhaskaran et al. observed a 0.84-fold decreased risk of lung cancer in ARB users [28]. Studies have reported that angiotensin II receptors, AT1 receptors and AT2 receptors are involved in enhancing tissue vascular endothelial growth factor protein levels, angiogenesis and tumor growth [29,30].

Fujita et al. revealed that blocking angiotensin II receptors could reduce tumor growth and metastasis [35]. Suganuma et al. and Fujimoto et al. have reported that blockade therapy for angiotensin II receptors could suppress the metastasis of human ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer in vitro [36,37]. Gong et al. indicated that blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptors could induce apoptotic cell death in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro [38]. The aforementioned findings indicate the potential biological mechanisms for the finding that ARB users have a lower risk of lung cancer.",

Since lung cancer was end point of this paper, lack information about smoking habits and exposure to carcinogens of lung cancer should raise concern for baseline bias. However, we have attempted to use COPD as proxy for smoking habitats and we also considered and analyzed asthma, tuberculosis and levels of air pollutants PM2.5, the possible baseline bias might be minimized. Second, we did not adjust for medical visits and chest examination frequency, including chest X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography; therefore, surveillance bias might be present, because ACEI users have more symptoms of dry cough and undergo more chest examinations. Third, detailed pathological reports such as small cell or non-small cell lung cancer and staging of lung cancer are unavailable in the NHIRD; therefore, further analysis of the association between ACEI use and subgroups of lung cancer could not be performed in this study. Fourth, the mobility of each participant could not be certain. Therefore, select PM2.5 in residential area as a feature would not so representative of real PM2.5 exposure conditions of each participant. Finally, medication adherence could not be fully ascertained in this study.",

Because diverse populations have different reasons for ACEI use, propensity score matching could minimize baseline bias of underlying diseases between the ACEI and ARB cohorts. In addition to matching comorbidities, we also matched each type of antihypertensive medication between the ACEI and ARB cohorts; thereby, baseline bias of antihypertensive medications was minimized. Second, we considered air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10 and SO2), which have been recognized as significant risk factors for lung cancer [14,40,41]. According to our literature review, this is the first study considering air pollutants as covariables in the investigation of the association between ACEIs and lung cancer. Third, this study only enrolled those who started using ACEI or ARB from the index date. Those who used ACEIs or ARBs before the index date or those who switched between ACEIs and ARBs were all excluded from our study. Thereby, the bias was considerably minimized. Fourth, NHI covers over 99.7% of the population of Taiwan and contains decades of data. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, the mean follow-up duration of this nationwide population-based study is the longest among similar studies of ACEIs and lung cancer [3,6,42]. This long follow-up enabled a more representative analysis of the relationship between ACEI dosage and duration and lung cancer risk. Furthermore, Hicks et al. speculated that the increased lung cancer risk observed in ACEI users might be due to the protective effect of ARBs against lung cancers [6]. Our study clearly demonstrated the protective effects of ARBs against lung cancer and the potential of ACEIs to cause lung cancer because we separately compared ACEI users and non-ACEI users and ARB users and non-ARB users.",
