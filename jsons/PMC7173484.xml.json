Adults are treated if the throat looks very inflamed or if there is pus on the tonsils.2Swabs are taken for culture of streptococci and antibiotics are started as above but stopped if Str. pyogenes is not found.3Swabs are taken for rapid diagnosis (by antigen detection) and penicillin commenced only if the throat swab is positive.\n",

This division is of importance in guiding primary treatment, but should not give the clinician a blinkered view in investigation, as some cases will invariably not follow a textbook! Expectorated sputum is often poorly collected and may not yield the pathogen. Blood cultures should always be taken from pneumonia patients but may not yield an organism, especially if antibiotics have been started. Antigen detection in urine or sputum by fluorescent antibodies, immuno-electrophoresis, latex agglutination or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a useful method for rapid diagnosis but may lack sensitivity. New amplified DNA detection methods are likely to improve diagnostic accuracy in respiratory infections. At present most cases of \u2018atypical\u2019 pneumonia are diagnosed by obtaining acute and convalescent sera, and by finding a significant titre or a rising titre of antibodies. Legionnaires\u2019 disease may be diagnosed by culture of Legionella pneumophila from sputum or a biopsy, but this has too low a sensitivity. Urine antigen detection by ELISA or DNA amplification of respiratory secretions have become more widely available methods of diagnosis.
