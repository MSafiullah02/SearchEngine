Aside from respiratory disease, COVID-19 has been shown to increase risk of thromboembolism2. Multiple hemostatic abnormalities have been reported including increased D-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels, prolonged thrombin, prothrombin and international normalized ration (INR) times, shortened activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombocytopenia, indicating possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In addition, other implicated etiologies include positive antiphospholipid antibodies and sepsis 4.",
