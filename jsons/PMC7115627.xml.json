Recent literature has suggested that low-cost carriers (LCCs) have become one of the key drivers of tourism development for a country or city (e.g. Chung and Whang, 2011, Dobruszkes and Mondou, 2013, Eugenio-Martin and Inchausti-Sintes, 2016, Graham and Dennis, 2010, Rey et al., 2011, Zhang and Lu, 2013). The emergence of LCCs has attracted different types of air travellers (leisure and business travellers) to visit other destinations with lower airfares, more frequent flights, loyalty programmes, and short turnaround times (e.g. Budd et al., 2014, Chang and Hung, 2013, Dresner, 2006, Mason, 2000). There seems little doubt that the rapid development of LCCs worldwide has had a significant impact on the tourism sector in terms of the transportation of air travellers and the promotion of tourist destinations, as well as the generation of tourists to emerging and mature destinations (Clav\u00e9, Saladi\u00e9, Cort\u00e9s-Jim\u00e9nez, Young, & Young, 2015).",

            "text": "New Zealand is an island country but is one of the popular international tourist destinations for visits, adventure, and sightseeing, thanks to this country's varied natural resources and heritage (e.g. Maori culture) (e.g. Balli and Tsui, 2015, Cloke and Perkins, 2002, Pearce, 1999, Ryan, 2002). It is evident that most tourism research of New Zealand has focussed on international tourism, as inbound and outbound international travel is strong. For 2014 and 2015, the total international visitor arrivals to New Zealand increased from approximately 2.86 to 3.13 million (Statistics New Zealand, 2015a). In addition, the total number of New Zealand residents travelling overseas grew to approximately 2.41 million from 2.27 million during the same period (Statistics New Zealand, 2015b). In contrast, domestic tourism in New Zealand has generally been less researched, considering its lesser importance in generating foreign exchange and earnings from the increasing number of international visitor arrivals (Pearce, 1993, Pearce, 1999). Arguably, international tourists to New Zealand cannot always sustain the New Zealand tourism industry, especially in the years of economic turmoil (e.g. the global financial crisis of 2008/09) and other exogenous shocks (e.g. the US 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003) (Becken and Gnoth, 2004, Yeoman et al., 2012). Although these events have had negative impacts on international tourism in the short term, New Zealand's tourism industry still looks promising in the long term, especially when domestic tourism is taken into consideration. In this light, a vibrant domestic tourism can bolster New Zealand's tourism industry from the fluctuations of international visitor arrivals, and also generates stability and predictability for its tourism sector (Okello, Kenana, & Kieti, 2012).",

However, Jetstar (the subsidiary of Qantas) was the first LCC to start scheduled domestic flight services in New Zealand since June 2009. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have investigated the LCC's impact on New Zealand's domestic tourism demand, although this rapidly growing low-cost air transport market deserves a thorough examination. Importantly, New Zealand's domestic tourism industry exhibited strong growth recently, and there were more than 21.5 million domestic guest nights across New Zealand's regions and cities in 2015 (Statistics New Zealand, 2015c).1\nThis active and strong domestic tourism demand in New Zealand again prompted this study to empirically explore the impact of the LCC (i.e. Jetstar) on domestic tourism demand and growth in New Zealand.",

Again, it is generally accepted that the LCC is playing an increasingly important role in New Zealand's domestic tourism sector, and there are only a few empirical studies and reports in the area of New Zealand's domestic tourism sector. Therefore, this study developed the econometric models to investigate the LCC's role in New Zealand's domestic tourism development, given that the five key New Zealand regions and tourist destinations (i.e. Auckland, Canterbury/Christchurch, Dunedin, Queenstown, and Wellington) are currently served by the LCC (Jetstar); these regions took a combined share of 44.07% and 43.94% of the total domestic guest nights in 2014 and 2015, respectively (Statistics New Zealand, 2015c). Simply, a clear knowledge of the role of the LCC on the tourism demand of New Zealand's major regions and tourist destinations can offer a better estimation of domestic tourist flows with further expansion of the LCC's operations to other smaller regions and/or cities. Thus the LCC's operations will benefit the future growth of New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and local/regional economies.",

Air traffic is a strong predictor of tourist arrivals (Albalate & Fageda, 2016). Tourism and air transport are explicitly linked, especially in the context of leisure traffic, and demand for air transport services is essentially derived from tourism activities (Lei and Papatheodorou, 2010, Papatheodorou and Lei, 2006). Most of the demand for LCC operations has been generated by the leisure market, including travellers on vacation and those visiting friends and relatives (VFR) (Lawton and Solomko, 2005, Mason and Alamdari, 2007). In tourism and air transport literature, researchers have generally achieved a consensus about the positive impact of LCCs on domestic tourism demand and domestic air travel demand. Dresner, Lin, and Windle (1996) suggested that the impact of LCCs on communities in the United States associated with the provision of low-cost services, fare reductions, and flight services between specific city-pairs other than neighbouring city pairs. Dresner (2006) further mentioned that the growth of LCCs has been important to the domestic US market, as LCCs transported a higher percentage of leisure passengers.",

Whyte and Prideaux (2007) suggested that the growth in Australian domestic air travel can be attributed to the two LCCs (Jetstar and Virgin Blue), and both airlines have benefited the regional tourism of Queensland destinations such as Cairns. Koo, Wu, and Dwyer (2009) also suggested that LCCs in Australia have improved air travel access to regions outside the state capital cities in Australia by offering discounted tickets and non-stop services from the key domestic origin markets. In addition, recent research by Williams and Bal\u00e1\u017e (2009) pointed out that the low-cost flight activities have had substantial impacts on labour migrants, knowledge, business connectivity/investment, and mobile markets, specifically tourism. In the case of Italy, Donzelli (2010) also revealed that LCCs contribute to job creation and increase tourism revenue, as well as having a significant impact on the local economy of Southern Italy. Moreover, Pulina and Cort\u00e9s-Jim\u00e9nez (2010) illustrated how LCCs influence the domestic and international tourism demand of the town of Alghero (Italy).",

There are relatively few prior studies on domestic tourism demand, and therefore, the literature on both international and domestic tourism is used to form a framework for this study to examine New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth empirically. In the tourism literature, habit persistence or repeat visits to key tourist destinations is important for explaining tourism demand (Balli et al., 2016, Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz and Montero-Mart\u00edn, 2007, Habibi, 2016, Pearce, 2012). Air accessibility (Koo et al., 2009, Tan et al., 2016, Whyte and Prideaux, 2007) and the availability of lower airfare services (e.g. low-cost airlines have had a strong impact on domestic air travel) (Dresner, 2006, Dresner et al., 1996) has promoted the growth of domestic tourism in different countries. Seasonality and calendar patterns of tourism demand are generally believed to constitute important issues for tourist destinations and tourism operators (Chung, 2009, Lim and McAleer, 2008).",

            "text": "It is also notable that economic demand-driven variables, such as tourism price variables, affected the number of international and domestic tourists travelling to a destination. These tourism price variables include destination prices or living costs such as accommodation (e.g. Cracolici and Nijkamp, 2009, Eugenio-Martin, 2003, Narayan, 2004, Witt and Martin, 1987), food and beverage prices (Narayan, 2004, Wen, 1997), and transportation costs (e.g. Divisekera, 2003, Kozak, 2001, Lim, 1999, Prideaux, 2000). It has also been suggested that accommodation and food and beverage are the two major sources of tourism revenue (Wang, Hung, & Shang, 2006). Relating to transportation costs, in the context of tourism demand and air transport demand, distance has been widely applied to estimate domestic and international tourism demand for a destination and/or a city-pair's air traffic volumes based on the gravity model: distances discourage travel between destinations (e.g. Hazledine, 2009, Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2008, Massidda and Etzo, 2012, Morley et al., 2014). In addition, Prideaux (2000) claimed transport access cost represents a significant factor in total holiday costs. Transportation costs can be grouped into air transport cost and land transport cost (Efthymiou and Papatheodorou, 2015, Syriopoulos and Thea Sinclair, 1993, Witt and Martin, 1987). In particular, Witt and Martin (1987) suggested that two points relating to transport cost to a destination need to be aware: (i) the substitutability of air transport for surface transport or land transport; and (ii) the increased and decreased attractiveness of near destinations, which are easily accessible by surface transport as compared with more distant destinations for which airfares increase or decrease relative to surface travel costs.",

In particular, Athanasopoulos and Hyndman (2008) found a negative impact of real GDP per capital on domestic tourism (i.e. the number of nights spent for holiday purposes) in Australia, and they also argued that Australians preferred to travel to foreign destinations than domestic destinations when Australia's economy activities improve. In this context, domestic and international destinations behave as substitute goods (Massidda & Etzo, 2012). Furthermore, the exchange rate (another important economic factor used to analyse international tourism demand) between the origin country and a foreign country has been consistently used in modelling international tourism demand (Song and Li, 2008, Tsui and Balli, 2015) because it has significant effect upon inbound and outbound tourism demand and can be treated as the pull and push factors of tourism demand (e.g. Hanqin & Lam, 1999\n2\n; Prideaux, 2005, Schiff and Becken, 2011, Webber, 2001). In addition, Martin and Witt (1988) noted that the cost of travel to a substitute destination could be expected to be a factor in destination selection.",

Data for the number of domestic guest nights and the total guest nights of the five regions in New Zealand were collected from Statistics New Zealand. In order to measure the impact of the LCC (Jetstar) on New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth, I also collected information on available seat kilometres (ASKs) scheduled by the LCC (Jetstar) and all the commercial airlines (Air New Zealand)3\nto the airport located in each region from the Official Airline Guide (OAG). It should be noted that there is only one commercial airport per city across New Zealand. Data on the GDP per capita in New Zealand were also collected from Statistics New Zealand for capturing the level of income of the New Zealand population for domestic holidays and travel propensity. In addition, I measured the effect of the exchange rate with regards to the substitution effect of international and domestic vacations; the exchange rate between the New Zealand and US dollars was retrieved from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Furthermore, two main regional tourism indicators (RTIs)4\n(the tourism price indices: accommodation, food and beverage) were obtained from the Ministry of Business Innovation & Development. Transport costs (aviation fuel price and petrol price) for domestic visitors to travel to a destination were collected from the Ministry of Transport. The two RTIs and transport costs aim to grasp the effect of the price levels that domestic tourists and holidaymakers paid for visiting and travelling to the sampled regions and/or cities in this study.",

Fig. 1\nshows monthly domestic guest nights and monthly ASKs scheduled by the LCC for the studied regions and their respective shares for each of the regions for the period of June 2009\u2013July 2015. In Fig. 1, the time series of the monthly domestic guest nights and the monthly LCC's ASKs for the five New Zealand regions exhibited different patterns, alongside the possibility of seasonal patterns. Note that New Zealand's domestic tourism has the characteristics of shorter stays and a strong visiting friends and family sector (Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment, 2014).5\nThe Auckland region leads the group with an average of 298,554 domestic guest nights per month, followed by Canterbury/Christchurch (155,645), Wellington (132,025), Queenstown (74,124), and Dunedin (42,269). Accordingly, the LCC's monthly average ASK for Auckland Airport is approximately 48.02 million, followed by Christchurch Airport (26.42 million), Wellington Airport (16.61 million), Queenstown Airport (10.84 million), and Dunedin Airport (3.76 million). In addition, the shares of domestic guest nights of the total guest nights (domestic and international) for all five regions exceed 56%, except for Queenstown has a share of 33.76%. The lower share of domestic guest nights for the Queenstown region indicates that it handled more international tourists than domestic tourists during the study period. However, the shares of the LCC's services for all the studied airports are between 13.14% and 31.36%: Queenstown Airport (31.36%), Auckland Airport (24.38%), Christchurch Airport (22.10%), Wellington Airport (17.24%), and Dunedin Airport (13.14%). These figures suggest that the LCC plays a significant role in New Zealand's domestic aviation market in transporting air travellers between the key cities and tourist destinations (Official Airline Guides (OAG), 2015, Statistics New Zealand, 2015c).",

As the case for other destinations, New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth may be affected by the factors and variables discussed in Section 2. Therefore, this study developed econometric models to investigate New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth. Following the demand function of Chi, Koo, and Lim (2010), this study specified New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth as a function of the LCC's seat capacity (ASKs), GDP per capita, two RTIs (accommodation, food and beverage), transport costs (aviation fuel price and petrol price), the exchange rate, other exogenous variables (the global financial crisis of 2008/09 and the Christchurch earthquakes of 2011), and seasonal dummies. Importantly, the rapid development and expansion of the LCC's operations (Jetstar) within New Zealand's domestic aviation market and its impact on domestic tourism have been less studied than international tourism. This study aimed to fill this gap and used the LCC's seat capacity/per region panel dataset to investigate its impact on New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth, as well as identifying the variables that influenced tourism demand for the five key New Zealand regions and tourist destinations (i.e. Auckland, Canterbury/Christchurch, Dunedin, Queenstown, and Wellington) for the period of June 2009\u2013July 2015.",

The basic intuition of the DiD approach is that to study the impact of the \u2018treatment\u2019, one compares the performance of the treatment group during the pre-and post-LCC periods relative to the performance of control group during the per- and post-LCC periods (Albalate and Fageda, 2016, Slaughter, 2001, Wooldridge, 2002). However, for this assumption to be valid it is necessary to demonstrate that both treatment and control groups are similar (or is the same) in the absence of treatment (the entry of LCC).9\nNote that Jetstar started its low-cost services (the treatment) in New Zealand since June 2006. To perform the DiD analysis, ten New Zealand regions/airports were selected and divided into two groups: (1) treatment regions/airports have LCC's services (Auckland, Canterbury/Christchurch, Dunedin, Queenstown, and Wellington); and (2) control regions/airports have no LCC's services (Hamilton, Palmerston North, Rotorua, Taupo, and Whangarei). The analysis period of the DiD estimation covers January 2008 to July 2015. That is, the difference between domestic guest nights for treatment regions and control regions during the pre- and post-periods of LCC's services.",

It is recognised that Jetstar adopted aggressive marketing strategies to launch its scheduled budget air travel services for air travellers to fly to four more domestic cities in New Zealand, namely Napier, Nelson, New Plymouth, and Palmerston North, starting from late 2015 and early 2016 (Australian Aviation, 2015). This rapid expansion of LCC's services in New Zealand's domestic aviation market is likely to stimulate and boost air travel demand with discounted tickets; this will continuously develop and benefit New Zealand's regional economies as well as the tourism and aviation sectors, particularly considering the significant domestic tourism expenditure and the significant number of staff employed in the tourism- and aviation-related sectors. For the amount of domestic tourism expenditure generated, there was approximately NZ$15,342 million and NZ$18,080 million in domestic tourism expenditure recorded in 2009 and 2015, respectively, equalling the growth of 17.85% over the years (Statistics New Zealand, 2015e). This situation is echoed by the increasing growth trends for the total guest nights (domestic and international guest nights) and the number of guest arrivals for all of the five key regions and tourist destinations in New Zealand that are connected by Jetstar's networks between 2009 and 2015 (see Fig. 2\n). In comparison with international tourism expenditure, domestic tourism expenditure plays an even more significant role in contributing towards New Zealand's economy during the same period: domestic and international tourism expenditure contributed a total of 18,080 million (60.59%) and 11,748 million (39.41%) to New Zealand's total tourism expenditure in 2015, respectively (see Fig. 3\n).",

            "text": "As indicated in Section 1 (Introduction), the empirical findings of this study have important implications for strategic planning and policy-setting by the local/regional tourism authorities and tourism operators, airline management, and airports regarding the best strategies and/or best approaches for attracting and transporting more tourists for visitation purposes. First, this study shows the existence of a strong relationship between the LCC's services (or the proliferation of air travel) and New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth, and this will help provide a more accurate and robust assessment of the impact of the LCC's operations and the necessary resources for advertising and promotion campaigns by the local/regional tourism authorities and tourism operators to promote their regions as attractive tourist destinations for domestic and international tourists. Second, in light of the substantial growth in domestic and international tourists and holidaymakers travelling within New Zealand, fierce competition between the incumbent carrier (Air New Zealand) and the LCC (Jetstar) will become apparent to capture the market share using different approaches (e.g. fare levels, destinations served, and frequency improvement, etc). It is expected that airline competition between Air New Zealand and Jetstar is likely to benefit and boost New Zealand's domestic tourism demand. Given the nature of domestic tourism in New Zealand and its unique geographical landscape with two separate islands, it is also likely that the future growth of Jetstar's operations and networks will further affect Air New Zealand's operations in terms of its schedule planning and fare levels for the trunk and regional routes. It is evident that Air New Zealand is now planning a significant shakeup to its domestic networks involving additional capacity being added onto the main trunk routes (e.g. Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington) and some regional routes against its domestic rival Jetstar (Australian Aviation, 2016). Similarly, the rapid growth of LCC's operations in New Zealand's domestic aviation market will also impact other travel modes (e.g. land transport) to transport travellers and tourists across regions and cities. Research into the impact of LCC's services on other choices of transport (or intermodal competition) is not within the scope of this study. Third, for the airports in other smaller regions in New Zealand, significant investment in the re-design and upgrade of terminal spaces and the purchase of other equipment is required to facilitate the entry of the LCC (Jetstar), as its ability to transport more tourist arrivals (particularly budget travellers) who pass through the airports is vital.",

First, the empirical results of this study revealed that the LCC (Jetstar) has significantly increased and boosted New Zealand's domestic tourism demand. The empirical findings of this study regarding the significant impact of LCC's services on New Zealand's domestic tourism are largely consistently with prior literature, regarding regional tourism growth and economy development resulting from the improvement of air access and the provision of discounted tickets for budget travellers. In addition, GDP per capita, the RTIs (accommodation, and food and beverage), land transport costs are also found to have affected New Zealand's domestic tourism during the study period.",

This study also allows better assessment of the growth of tourist arrivals (domestic and international) and tourism activity for a region or city with the entry of the LCC, particularly considering the recent rapid expansion of LCC's operations in New Zealand's domestic aviation market. For the growth of low-cost air travel and the associated benefits for the local/regional tourism industry and economy, it is important for the local/regional governments and airport authorities to plan and provide sufficient airport capacity and better equipment to accommodate existing and future LCC's operations, and to handle the increasing amount of tourist numbers and budget travellers.",

This is because the length of stay and types of accommodation stayed at a destination can be affected by travel purposes (e.g. VFR, work and business, holiday, and backpacking). However, the current approaches in this study to estimate the LCC's impact on domestic guest nights in New Zealand are largely decided by the availability of tourism data from Statistics New Zealand. As the extension of this study, an in-depth study is recommended to forecast the number of visitor arrivals in different classes (e.g. VFR, business visitors, holiday visitors, and backpacker visitors) for all the regions in New Zealand that have and will be served by the LCC. This would further allow insight to the impact of LCC's services (especially the impact of budget fares on different classes of tourists) on New Zealand's regional tourism sector and economic growth; and (ii) this study did not investigate the effect of tourism demand spillover upon tourist flows between the regions (i.e. the geographical effect). Yang and Wong (2012) claimed that the term of spillover effect refers to the indirect and unintentional effects that a region's sector exerts on tourism flows to other regions. For example, if Queenstown (the popular tourist destination in New Zealand) cannot accommodate the increase in domestic and international tourist arrivals during the peak travel seasons with sufficient star-rated hotel rooms. As the result, many tourists may choose to stay at Christchurch and drive to Queenstown as the driving time is approximately 6 hours. Therefore, a further analysis is recommended to investigate the spillover of tourist flows across New Zealand using the similar approach of Yang and Wong (2012). This would allow insights to domestic and international tourist spillovers for the popular tourist destinations in New Zealand. Notably, tourism demand spillover (or passenger demand spillover of New Zealand's domestic tourism) will also impact airline operations and revenues while considering the difference between observed demand (bookings) and true demand for a particular flight and/or destination. For example, if Air New Zealand's scheduled seat capacity cannot meet the true demand of international and domestic tourists to a destination (e.g. Queenstown) during the peak travel seasons because of capacity constraints or booking control limits imposed on various fare classes. Three common situations can then be observed: revenue losses, the displacement between international and domestic tourists, or the spilling of demand through refusing further reservations from tourists or passenger demand turned away. In particular, spilled tourists may be lost to Jetstar or may be accommodated on other flights of Air New Zealand (Belobaba & Farkas, 1999). The challenges facing an airline (irrespective of Air New Zealand or Jetstar in this study) is to use revenue management to better allocate and sell airline seat inventory while improving passenger revenues; prior literature shows that airlines with revenue management will benefit incremental revenue gains of 2\u20135% (Belobaba, 1992). To do this, Air New Zealand and Jetstar need to know the distribution for the expected high-fare true demand and schedule the popular destinations in New Zealand with larger airplanes through fleet assignment during the peak travel seasons (Swan, 2002). Importantly, an accurate and robust forecasting of passenger demand is the heart of a successful airline revenue management to ensure an airline's capacity for a particular flight and/or destination meeting true demand.",
