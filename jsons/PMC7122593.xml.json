After its infection, the antibody produced in the human body is different from the antibodies produced after infection of the known three groups of coronavirus. These differences indicate that SARS-CoV is a novel pathogenic virus to humans. Based on previous knowledge, three groups (group 1, group 2, and group 3) of coronavirus and three serotypes (HcoV-229E of group 1 and HCoV-OC43 of group 2) are identified. At present, SARS-CoV is identified as group 4 of coronavirus.",

Its diameter is commonly 60\u2013120 mm, with radially arranged petal or cilium-like protrusions on its envelope. The protrusion is about 20 mm in length or longer with a narrow base and with a crown-like appearance resembling the classic coronavirus. The viral envelope mainly includes three types of glycoproteins: spike protein (S protein), membrane protein (M protein), and envelope protein (E protein). In some viral strains, hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE protein) can also be found. S protein is a baseball-shaped glycoprotein protruding out of the envelope, which plays a key role in the binding of virus to the surface receptor of the host cells and in mediating membrane fusion into the host cells. It is also the main antigen protein of coronavirus. M protein is a transmembrane protein, which plays an important role in the formation of the virus envelope and budding. E protein is a relatively small protein mainly scattering at the virus envelope. The categorization of coronavirus and its structural pattern are illustrated in Figs. 20.1 and 20.2.\n\n",

On the surfaces of plastic, glass, mosaic, metal, cloth, and photocopy paper, it can survive for 2\u20133 days. SARS-CoV is sensitive to temperature, with weaker resistance at higher temperature. It can be inactivated at a temperature of 56 \u00b0C for 90 min and 75 \u00b0C for 30 min. SARS-CoV can be killed by diethyl ether at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h.

In the throat swab and sputum specimen from patients at the acute stage, SARS-CoV can be detected. Spread along with aerosol is another route of its transmission. The susceptible individuals can be infected after inhalation of SARS-CoV containing aerosol suspended in the air. Spread via touches is also an important route of its transmission. For instance, the hands of susceptible individuals directly or indirectly touch secretions and excreta from the patients or utensils contaminated by the virus. Then the virus infects the human body via the mouth, nose, and ocular mucosa. Moreover, it can also be transmitted via virus-containing aerosol in the laboratory with inappropriately preserved SARS-CoV strains. In April 2004, a typical accident was reported that inappropriately preserved SARS-CoV strains in a laboratory in Beijing, China, caused five cases of infection with one case of death. During the epidemic period, nosocomial infection is more likely to occur. The main routes include: (1) Medical staff is infected by direct contact to the patients during treatment and attendance. The direct contacts are more likely to occur during oral cavity examination and tracheal cannulation with the medical staff inappropriately protected. (2) The visitors and those responsible for attending the patients are likely to be infected. (3) The patients with other diseases can be infected due to sharing the ward with a patient with SARS. Nosocomial infection is closely related to facilities of the ward, severity of the symptoms, stage the conditions are in, immunity of individuals with contact history, and personal protective measure of medical staff and visitor.",

The changes are characterized by diffuse alveolar injury, with manifestations at different stages. At around day 10 of the illness course, the pathological changes include pulmonary edema, cellulose exudation, formation of hyaline membrane, desquamative pneumonia induced by accumulation of macrophages and shedding of type II alveolar epithelial cells in alveolar cavity, and focal pulmonary hemorrhage. These pathological changes can be observed on autopsy specimen and biopsy specimen collected by bronchofiberscopy. Some proliferated alveolar epithelium fuses into each other to form zygote-like multinucleated giant cells. In the proliferated alveolar epithelium and the cytoplasm of exudated monocyte, viral inclusion bodies can be observed (Fig. 20.4). Along with progress of the condition, in cases with an illness course exceeding 3 weeks, organization of intra-alveolar exudates and hyaline membrane as well as hyperplasia of fibroblasts in alveolar septum can be observed. Both of them constantly integrate to cause alveolar occlusion and atrophy, with consequent lung consolidation. Only in some cases, apparent fiber hyperplasia occurs to induce pulmonary fibrosis or even sclerosis. In intrapulmonary small blood vessels, fibroid microthrombus can often be found. For the above pathological changes, great individual difference can be found. Even in the lungs of one patient, pathological changes of different stages can be found. In some cases, especially those who have received long-term treatment, sporadic lobular pneumonia or even large-area fungal infection can be commonly found, and the most commonly found fungal infection is aspergillus infection. The secondary infections can involve the pleura to cause pleural effusion, pleural adhesion, or even occlusion of pleural cavity.\n",
