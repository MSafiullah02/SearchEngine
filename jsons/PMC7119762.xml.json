            "text": "Among the five salmonid herpesviruses, EEDV causes one of the more lethal diseases in its host, the lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). In the early 1980s, EEDV led to the demise of over 15 million hatchery-reared juvenile lake trout (Bradley et al., 1988, 1989; McAllister and Herman, 1989). Following 30 years of minimal mortalities associated with EEDV, EEDV outbreaks recurred in Wisconsin and Michigan hatcheries, resulting in morbidity and mortality in hundreds of thousands of lake trout in 2012 and 2017 (Kurobe et al., 2009; Shavalier, 2017). In the absence of effective control measures to combat this virus, the implementation of stringent biosecurity measures and use of avoidance strategies remain the only tools available to prevent EEDV spread. As a result, the development of a sensitive and specific initial diagnostic tool that is rapid and reasonably inexpensive is deemed necessary to perform screening of wild gamete donor fish as well as periodic testing of hatchery-reared fish throughout their growth.",

After uncovering of the molecular characterization of Salmonid Herpesvirus-4 and -5, it was determined that the current EEDV qPCR assay was unable to distinguish between Salmonid Herpesvirus-3, -4, and -5, as the viruses share high sequence similarity in the terminase gene. This led Glenney et al. (2016b) to design three primer sets based on the glycoprotein gene. Using these primer sets in a SYBR Green qPCR assay, the authors were able to amplify each virus individually. Herein, we report on the development of an EEDV-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection and quantification of EEDV in infected lake trout tissues that is comparable in specificity and sensitivity to the SYBR Green qPCR.",

All samples came from negative control (numbers 1\u201320) or an experimentally infected fish group (number 21 through 100) as described in Shavalier (2017).

Samples were determined to be positive based on a threshold of 35 cycles and an amplification level equal to 10% of maximum fluorescence.

In this study, we developed a LAMP assay for EEDV detection in fish tissue with relatively high specificity and sensitivity, and therefore, represents a time-and cost-effective early diagnostic tool for the detection and quantification of this deadly virus. The optimal reaction temperature was determined to be 67.1 \u00b0C which is relatively higher than the optimal LAMP reaction temperatures reported for other viruses, such as 62 \u00b0C for the orf virus (family Poxviridae; genus Parapoxvirus) (Li et al., 2013), 63 \u00b0C for human papillomavirus (Saetiew et al., 2011), and 64 \u00b0C for nervous necrosis virus (family Nodaviridae; genus Betanodavirus) (Hwang et al., 2016). This variation can be explained by the use of different primer sets for different viruses. Actually, the results of the temperature optimization showed that Bst DNA polymerase effectively amplified the nucleic acid templates at a relatively wide temperature range from 62.6 to 69.1 \u00b0C, which facilitates the possibility of running this test under field conditions should commercially available kits be developed in the future. The Ct value of samples tested using the EEDV LAMP assay showed substantial variation when the concentration of MgCl2 changed from 2 mM to 6 mM, and also when the concentration of dNTPs changed from 1.2 mM to 1.4 mM, both of which are indications that the concentration of MgCl2 and dNTPs are critical parameters in the EEDV LAMP reaction.",

Although the qPCR identified 11 samples as positive that the qLAMP did not, all but two of them were less than 1000 copies and as indicated above, accurate quantification below this level can be difficult. Therefore, in the case of negative EEDV LAMP results in fish undergoing mortality with clinical signs suggestive of EEDV, additional confirmatory tests should be performed. While it took the real time SYBR Green qPCR 70 min to finish 50 cycles of amplification, it took for the EEDV LAMP assay 50 min to finish the same number of cycles, a matter that underscore the relative time-effectiveness to the developed EEDV-LAMP assay compared to the SYBR Green qPCR. Besides, the newly developed EEDV LAMP assay showed repeatability and consistency in detecting of EEDV in authors\u2019 laboratory over last four years (Shavalier, 2016). When the viral loads determined by qLAMP were compared to those of the SYBR Green qPCR, both assays were capable of quantifying viral loads over a wide range (Table 4). Although there were some discrepancies with identification of individual positive tissues between the two assays, when all samples were examined together, the paired t-test demonstrated no significant difference between the results of the two different assays (p > 0.05). Indeed, the discrepancy was limited to samples with low viral copy numbers. In total, these quantification results lend further support to that this qLAMP assay can serve as an early valuable detection tool both in the laboratory and under field conditions. In addition, calcein is a complexmetric indicator meaning that positive reactions can be visualized by the naked eye, a matter that allows the LAMP reaction to be performed in fish hatcheries under field conditions (Suebsing et al., 2013, 2015).",

This novel assay has the advantage of being rapid and is promising for use as a surveillance tool for EEDV diagnosis in clinical samples. Moreover, the qLAMP established in this study provides a low-cost quantification method for EEDV loads in tissue samples, and the use of calcein as a fluorescent indicator, which can also be visualized by the naked eye, or under a UV light, provides a good platform for optimization of an assay that can be used in field conditions, such as aquaculture facilities.",
