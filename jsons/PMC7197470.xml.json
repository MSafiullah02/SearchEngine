In general, viruses that show low pathogenicity and prolonged infectiousness are likely to exhibit relatively high and constant prevalence (Anderson & May 1979a) and can therefore be termed \u2018endemic.\u2019 In contrast, viruses that spread rapidly, have a shorter duration of infectiousness and cause higher host mortality (or immunity) are more likely to generate discrete epidemics (Anderson & May 1979b). Epidemic diseases are characterized by rapid changes in the prevalence of infection and may disappear from the host population for extended periods. Such pathogens are likely to require high host densities for invasion and persistence, and the extent of outbreaks should increase with the size of the susceptible host population (May 1983; Onstad & Carruthers 1990; Anderson & May 1982; Jaffee et al. 1992).",

Recent empirical and theoretical studies have shown that virulence can be advantageous to the parasite and is not necessarily a side\u2010effect of novel host\u2013parasite combinations (e.g. Allison 1982; Ewald 1983; Anderson & May 1991; Herre 1993; Lenski & May 1994; Levin 1996). Although transient impacts of novel parasites can be immense, few studies have addressed the long\u2010term effects of disease in wildlife populations (Grenfell & Gulland 1995). Most wildlife diseases are studied via incidental post mortems, and manipulative experiments in natural populations are often impossible (Dobson & McCallum 1995).",

For example, canine distemper virus (CDV) killed over 70% of the last remaining colony of free\u2010living black\u2010footed ferrets (Thorne & Williams 1988) and phocine distemper killed over 18 000 harbour seals in northern Europe (Osterhaus & Vedder 1988). Rabies has been suggested to cause population decline in wolves, Ethiopian wolves and African wild dogs (e.g. MacDonald 1980; Kat et al. 1995; Weiler, Garner & Ritter 1995; Sillero, King & MacDonald 1996; Ballard & Krausman 1997; Laurenson et al. 1998). Perhaps the best\u2010studied example is the canine distemper virus (CDV) outbreak that struck the Serengeti lions and several other species in late 1993\u2013early 1994 (Roelke\u2010Parker et al. 1996; also see Alexander & Appel 1994; Alexander et al. 1995). CDV originated from the large population of domestic dogs surrounding the Serengeti ecosystem and killed 35% of the Serengeti lions within 6 months. Over 85% of the lions were infected, and many victims showed neurological disorders, encephalitis, and pneumonia. While this outbreak followed a well\u2010defined onset, many other viral epidemics have been inferred solely from cross\u2010sectional serological surveys (e.g. Olmsted et al. 1992; Spencer & Morkel 1993; Creel et al. 1997) and detailed/long\u2010term investigations of virus\u2013carnivore interactions are rare (Grenfell & Gulland 1995; Dobson & McCallum 1995).",

These viruses show a variety of transmission modes, symptoms and durations of infectiousness in domestic carnivores (Table 1). For example, both feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV, a lentivirus closely associated with HIV) and feline herpesvirus permanently infect their hosts and do not elicit lasting immunity (Table 1). In contrast, canine distemper virus (CDV), feline calicivirus, feline coronavirus and feline parvovirus generally cause only temporary infection, although a small proportion of infected hosts may persist as asymptomatic carriers. Using serological data from two different lion populations, we first classify these viruses as either endemic or epidemic. We estimate the timing of each epidemic by combining the temporal pattern of seroprevalence with information on the lions\u2019 ages at the time of sampling. We then examine the relationship between the extent of each epidemic, and the proportion and density of susceptible hosts in the population. Finally, we measure the impact of viral infection on lion mortality and birth rates.",

All animals are individually recognized from natural markings (Packer & Pusey 1993) and most have been regularly observed since birth (Pusey & Packer 1994), and thus the precise age is known for each individual. Blood samples were collected in the Serengeti each year between 1984 and 1994, and the Crater lions were sampled in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1991 (see Table 2 for annual sample sizes). These samples were originally collected for genetic assay (O\u2019Brien et al. 1987; Packer et al. 1991a,b) and to investigate the CDV outbreak in 1994 (Roelke\u2010Parker et al. 1996). Serological assays were later performed to assess the lions\u2019 exposure to FIV (Olmsted et al. 1992; Brown et al. 1994), CDV (Roelke\u2010Parker et al. 1996), and feline leukaemia, herpes\u2010, parvo\u2010, corona\u2010 and calicivirus (Hofmann\u2010Lehmann et al. 1996). Over 300 lions were also tested for FeLV, but none showed detectable levels of antigens (Hofmann\u2010Lehmann et al. 1996). Table 3 summarizes the precise assays and criteria used to determine sero\u2010status for the remaining six viruses. Many animals were tested repeatedly, and repeat samples are included in any descriptive analysis, but excluded from all statistical tests unless an animal seroconverted.",

The Serengeti study area covers the south\u2010eastern quarter of the Serengeti National Park. This 2000 km2 area consists of two contrasting habitats: acacia woodland and open\u2010grass plains (see Packer et al. 1988). Lions on the plains live at lower densities and endure lower levels of food availability than their woodlands counterparts. The Ngorongoro Crater is located about 90 km to the south\u2010east of the Serengeti study area, and the Crater lions enjoy higher and more consistent levels of food availability than the Serengeti lions (Hanby, Bygott & Packer 1995). However, the Crater is a small, isolated population (80\u2013100 animals) with an associated loss in genetic diversity compared to the much larger Serengeti population (O\u2019Brien et al. 1987; Packer et al. 1991b), which includes an estimated 2000\u20133000 animals (Schaller 1972; Hanby & Bygott 1978).",

Combining data from all years, small cubs quickly seroconverted to FIV+ , and this trend was similar in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater (Fig. 2).

Every lion born after 1981 was seronegative for CDV until 1993/94, when a new epidemic swept through the population, infecting lions of all ages (Fig. 4b). This pattern strongly suggests that the virus had been absent from the Serengeti from 1981 until the end of 1993. Data from Ngorongoro suggest that CDV infected the Crater lions sometime in 1980, but then disappeared from the population for the following 11 years: the youngest seropositive animal had been born in June 1980, but no animal born later than this date had been infected by the end of our last sampling effort in 1991 (Fig. 4c).",

This suggests that epidemics of parvovirus and coronavirus each spread with a typical magnitude and each strike at a typical level of seroprevalence.

Only the 1994 CDV outbreak inflicted lower survival on every age\u2010group (with significant declines for yearlings (\u03c72 = 24\u00b709, d.f. = 1, P = 0\u00b70000) and 3\u2010year\u2010olds (\u03c72 = 10\u00b761, d.f. = 1, P = 0\u00b70011). However, neither the 1981 CDV outbreak in the Serengeti nor the 1980 outbreak in Ngorongoro had any appreciable impact on lion survival, although two Serengeti lions developed myoclonus in 1981.",

However, the CDV outbreak of 1994 was well\u2010documented and included clearly observed cases of seizures and myoclonus (Roelke\u2010Parker et al. 1996). This suggests that the high survival rates during earlier outbreaks of CDV may have been due to non\u2010pathogenic strains of the virus. It was not possible to estimate the extent of the earlier CDV epidemics, but it is at least noteworthy that CDV in 1994 was the most extensive of any documented outbreak and struck the largest population of susceptibles. Unfortunately, we have been unable to collect any blood samples from Ngorongoro Crater since 1991, so we cannot test whether the recent decline in this population (see Fig. 7) was associated with a viral outbreak. A domestic dog with CDV was found on the Crater rim in October of 1994 (Cleaveland 1996), and several of the Ngorongoro Crater lions were conspicuously ill at about the same time, but none showed neurological symptoms of CDV.",

Because of high adult seroprevalence for all viruses, adult females could only have been \u2018susceptible\u2019 to a virus if the interval between outbreaks was sufficiently long. This analysis is therefore restricted to seven widely\u2010spaced outbreaks in the Serengeti and only includes young (and hence susceptible) females. Because of age\u2010related changes in fecundity (Packer et al. 1998), as well as medium\u2010term ecological variations (Hanby et al. 1995), we compare the reproductive performance of 4\u201313\u2010year\u2010old females over the first 2 years before and/or after each outbreak. As in the mortality analysis, none of the four viruses consistently inflicted a significant loss in fecundity, although there seems to be a recurring effect of CDV (Fig. 13). Again, it is possible that there were strain differences, as fecundity was slightly lowered during the 1985 parvovirus and calicivirus outbreaks. The high annual variation around the 1990 calicivirus and 1993 coronavirus epidemics is difficult to interpret and presumably reflects other ecological factors (such as annual variations in prey availability, population density, and social disruption; see Packer et al. 1988)",

Both show consistently high prevalence (Figs 1 and 2) and both appear to be relatively harmless, although it is difficult to compare the fitness of infected and uninfected hosts. In domestic cats, FIV follows a similar aetiology as HIV in humans (Pedersen et al. 1987; Yamamoto et al. 1988; Torten et al. 1991) and, like HIV in humans, FIV appears to have infected domestic cats only recently (Rigby et al. 1993; Carpenter & O\u2019Brien 1995). We could find no evidence that FIV status influenced lion mortality (Fig. 11), nor did we observe any obvious signs of immunodeficiency or clinical pathology in FIV+ individuals (but see Poli et al. 1995). Phylogenetic analysis of FIV sequences in our study animals suggests that lions have been hosts to the virus for long periods of time (Brown et al. 1994), and an attenuated effect from FIV infection may have arisen through a variety of co\u2010evolutionary mechanisms (reviewed by Carpenter & O\u2019Brien 1995). Alternatively, studies of domestic cats suggest that FIV may be more pathogenic in individuals that are co\u2010infected with FeLV (Courchamp et al. 1997). Thus, the low impact of FIV in these lions may be because they are not co\u2010infected with FeLV.",

In contrast, parvovirus required a larger number of susceptibles and infected a larger proportion of susceptibles during outbreaks. CDV is both the exception and the rule for this pattern.

Indeed, none of these viruses regularly inflicted the same degree of mortality observed in domestic cats (Table 1). Sequence data are only available for the 1994 CDV strain (Roelke\u2010Parker et al. 1996), so we cannot make similar assessments of co\u2010evolutionary history as for FIV, nor can we comment on genetic differences between strains of the same virus. However, strain differences in pathogenicity have been well documented in other morbiliviruses besides CDV (e.g. rinderpest, Plowright 1982). It is also possible that all of these viruses were harmful to some extent, but our demographic analysis was too coarse\u2010grained to detect their effects.

CDV caused considerable mortality in 1994 and may have lowered host fertility during the 1981 and 1994 outbreaks. However, CDV entered the lion population in discrete, widely\u2010spaced epidemics, and these epidemics have been sufficiently infrequent to inflict lasting consequences. The Serengeti population recovered rapidly from the 1994 epidemic, regaining its former size by the middle of 1997 (Fig. 7). Domestic dogs are the primary reservoir for CDV in the Serengeti/Ngorongoro region (Cleaveland 1996), and the dog population has grown dramatically with the growing human population over the past 30 years, raising the prospects of more frequent, extensive, and virulent CDV epidemics in the lions and other wild carnivores.
