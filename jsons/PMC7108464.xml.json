A 50-\u03bcL reaction solution is formed by mixing RPA primers and/or probe with a buffer solution, and target nucleic acids. This mixture is then added directly to 1 lyophilized RPA reagent pellet followed by brief mixing and centrifugation steps. The reaction is initiated by adding magnesium. Incubation is performed at a single temperature ranging between 37 and 42 \u00b0C depending on the kit used (Table 1). After incubation, the detection of RPA products can be either performed in real time or after the reaction. With real-time detection, results are obtained during the incubation stage, typically in <10 min. With post-RPA detection, when agarose gel electrophoresis is used, RPA amplicons must first be purified, and then separated on gel. With lateral-flow detection, RPA amplicons can be used directly without purification, generating results on the dipstick strip within 5 min post-RPA.",

            "text": "For real-time detection, 2 kinds of probes, RPA-exo or fpg, can be used. Conventional probes such as TaqMan cannot be used in RPA, and PCR Taq polymerases are not compatible with the amplification system either. The 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase progressively digests the displaced strand during the strand displacement process, thus inhibiting DNA amplification. This explains the use of strand displacement polymerases in RPA that do not have the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease activity required for TaqMan probe detection (e.g., BsuDNA polymerase). The exo probe is a long oligonucleotide (46\u201352 bases) bearing an internal base analog [e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF)] located between a fluorophore (e.g., FAM or TAMRA) and a quencher (e.g., Black Hole Quencher 1 or Black Hole Quencher 2) with a blocked 3\u2032 end (e.g., 3\u2032 phosphate group or dideoxynucleotide). This abasic residue serves as a substrate for E. coli exonuclease III that can cleave THF only after binding of the probe to the target sequence (10), thus separating the fluorophore from its quencher (Fig. 2A). Fluorescence generation typically yields a detectable signal within 5\u201310 min during the RPA reaction (6). It should be noted that exonuclease cleavage generates a free 3\u2032-end of the exo probe, which is then extendable by polymerase enzyme serving as a forward primer (4). Compared to the exo probe, the fpg probe is shorter (32\u201335 bases) and cannot serve as a primer. It has a 5\u2032 quencher and a fluorophore at 5\u20136 bases downstream attached to the ribose of an abasic nucleotide via a C-O-C linker, herein deoxyribose (dR)-fluorophore. Fpg, an 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, has catalytic mode different from that of exonuclease III because it recognizes and cleaves the dR-fluorophore while leaving 2 nonextendable sequences (Fig. 2B) (10).",

Therefore, the Nfo endonuclease can replace exonuclease III because both recognize the same substrate (i.e., THF residue). However, Nfo generates a lower signal and incomplete cleavage; limiting the degradation of amplicons allows amplicon detection by gel electrophoresis, an option not possible when using an exo probe (10). For lateral flow assay, the reverse primer (opposing amplification primer) has a 5\u2032-biotin label and forms with the labeled nfo probe a double labeled amplicon which is then captured with species-specific anti-FAM antibody coupled to gold nanoparticles. Another immobilized antibody captures biotin, thus forming the detection line on commercially available strips (MGHD 1, TwistDx). A control line with immobilized antispecies antibodies serves to monitor the lateral flow process (Fig. 2C).",

For instance, 9% of RPA primers were below 30 bases and 7% were over 35 bases long (36\u201345 bases). Short sequences of 20\u201323 bases were used in studies for which primers also served as capture probes (11, 12). Ten percent of primers sequences had a G+C content <30% and 3% had a G+C content >65%. For published exo probes sequences, 17% of exo probes were shorter than the recommended length (34\u201344 bases instead of 46\u201352 bases) and 10% were of 53 and 58 bases long. A small proportion (6%) of exo probes had G+C content below 30%. Most of the probes that were considered in our review used the exo probe real-time detection method (75%) rather than fpg (14%) or nfo (11%) probes. Therefore, we considered that discrepant data for fpg and nfo probes were not as representative as those for exo probes (see online Supplemental Fig. 2).",

            "text": "RPA was successfully used to detect major human pathogens including bacteria (6, 13\u201323), viruses (9, 24\u201332), fungi (33), and parasites (34, 35), as well as genetically modified organisms (36, 37) and genetic alterations observed in cancer cells (38, 39). RPA was also used for HIV diagnosis in low-resource settings (40, 41) (Tables 2 and 3). The analytical limit of detection and the turnaround time varied between assays: for RNA detection, 10\u201321 copies of target detected in 2\u201320 min and 100\u20135 \u00d7 104 copies in 4\u201320 min; for DNA detection, 1\u201350 copies detected in 7\u201335 min and 98\u2013778 copies detected in 8\u201335 min, suggesting that RPA efficiency could be dependent on target sequence, amplicon size, and type of biological sample tested. It was demonstrated that fpg probes are less sensitive (104 target molecules detected) than exo probe assays (10 target molecules detected), suggesting that the Fpg nuclease has slower kinetics in real-time detection than that of exonuclease III (14). This explains the preferred use of real-time exo kit. The only advantage of fpg over exo kit is the fact that the former does allow detection by agarose gel electrophoresis.",

We also designed an RNA detection assay using the same kit (TwistAmp\u00ae exo RT kit) for the detection of RNA transcript from influenza A virus in the presence of pooled nasopharyngeal swab samples (a combination of different nasopharyngeal samples negative for influenza A virus). We obtained a limit of detection of 8.77 \u00b1 2.24 RNA copies (95% CI) vs 13.5 \u00b1 6.6 RNA copies (95% CI) with and without the samples, respectively. In both cases, 5 copies of RNA transcript were detected in <20 min, thus correlating with results of other studies (see online Supplemental Table 1).",

Another study also reported a reduced performance of MuLV RT compared to Transcriptor in an assay detecting RNA extracts for foot-and-mouth disease virus from 45 samples (62% sensitivity for MuLV RT\u2013based RT-RPA and 98% sensitivity for RT-RPA using Transcriptor RT) (25). When attempting to compare the performance of MuLV RT to Transcriptor RT, we obtained similar RT enzyme performances; 104 copies of Influenza A RNA transcript were detected in 3.5 min with MuLV RT compared to 5 min with Transcriptor RT with similar fluorescence signal intensity of 100 AFU (see online Supplemental Fig. 3). Therefore, it seems that RPA could be used with different RT enzymes. However, there is yet no publication on the use of RT-RPA for quantitative RNA measurements.",

Briefly, different volumes of a diluted stool sample [5 \u03bcL of stool diluted in 750 \u03bcL 1X TE buffer (10 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.0 with HCl and 1 mmol/L EDTA)] ranging from 0.5 to 5 \u03bcL were inoculated with 103 genome copies of Streptococcus agalactiae genomic DNA and amplified with the exo kit. RPA was still efficient with 5 \u03bcL of stool sample added (i.e., 1/10 of reaction volume) with no significant inhibition (results were generated in <15 min). Hence, this suggests that with appropriate sample preparation, direct RPA amplification and detection from crude samples may be feasible. For instance, by consolidating sample preparation with nucleic acid amplification/detection, Erh-Chia and colleagues were able to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) DNA directly from spiked blood samples. The process consisted of inertial plasma separation avoiding red blood cells lysis thereby eliminating a potential PCR-inhibitor, hemoglobin. This system proved to have >99% separation efficiency (45). Ultimately, the best sample preparation approach should be adjusted for each type of application and should consider many factors such as target concentration, presence of inhibitors, and lysis efficiency.",

The turnaround time reflects the speed of the isothermal technology for generating results; ideally, the speed of the test should be less than 1 h (59). The incubation temperature is an important element because it is associated with the complexity of instrumentation required for isothermal amplification. In general, isothermal technologies operate at lower temperatures (e.g., 30\u201342 \u00b0C), thereby needing less power, especially because they do not require initial denaturation and cycling steps at 95 \u00b0C. For instance, among the isothermal technologies listed in online Supplemental Table 2, only 5 of 10 are completely isothermal. These techniques (helicase-dependent amplification, RPA, nicking enzyme amplification reaction, ribonuclease-mediated amplification, and cross-priming amplification) enable nucleic acid amplification at a single temperature throughout the reaction, thus alleviating the need for temperature fluctuation and control and simplifying instrumentation. Several published studies have performed RPA using simple instruments such as ovens or heat blocks. Sodium sulfate was even used as an exothermic heat source for RPA reaction operation (52). This makes RPA suitable for noninstrumented nucleic acid amplification platforms, as demonstrated recently with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology by a study from the Programs for Assessment of Technology in Health Research Institute (60). Moreover, the capacity of RPA to catalyze nucleic acid amplification using only body heat was also demonstrated (54). To our knowledge, RPA was the first isothermal technology to demonstrate noninstrumentation requirements (body heat), which is very important criteria for POC applications. In addition, the stability of RPA dried reagents allows transportation and storage without refrigeration (45). This means that a broad range of end users can operate RPA especially in low resource settings.",

            "text": "Moreover, the detection strategies offered by isothermal technologies are associated with both speed of analysis and complexity of instrumentation; simple detection methods are usually fast. For instance, RPA offers several detection strategies either in real-time or post- amplification. Real-time RPA detection is performed with fluorescent probes generating results in 5\u201315 min in a closed-tube assay format avoiding downstream cross-contamination. For postamplification detection methods, RPA uses agarose gel electrophoresis (approximately 60 min for results) or lateral-flow strips (20\u201335 min) (Tables 2 and 3). By contrast, for LAMP the application of probe-based detection methods was not feasible because of the cauliflower-like structures of LAMP products (62). Therefore, real-time LAMP detection is restricted to fluorescent dyes for detection. Other postamplification LAMP detection methods could rely on the naked eye because turbidity of the reaction mixture increases because of pyrophosphate by-product formation (63). However, with end-point analysis (gel electrophoresis, lateral flow, or turbidimetry), as in the case of helicase-dependent amplification, nucleic acid sequence\u2013based amplification, or LAMP, results required 60\u2013180 min depending on the assay (61). Furthermore, LAMP products yield a ladder-like pattern during agarose gel electrophoresis, whereas RPA-purified amplicons can be directly identified by a specific band on agarose gel (35). RPA speed could be potentially exploited for NGS (next-generation sequencing) applications for presequencing amplification required for generating libraries (64).",

In these studies, the validation of RPA was made on clinical samples such as vaginal/anal lysates (n = 50, 96% clinical sensitivity and 100% clinical specificity) (17), surgical biopsy samples (n = 12, 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity) (65), or serum samples (n = 203, 77% sensitivity and 97.9% specificity) (31). RPA showed minimal requirements for sample preparation and multiplexing was feasible. Hence, integrating assay control was successfully applied to RPA tests (17, 66). Despite RPA showing comparable clinical performances to PCR and LAMP, it also shows some differences. Unlike LAMP (67), there is no software available to design RPA primers and probes. Consequently, screening of several RPA primer and probe sets is required to choose the optimal combination. Furthermore, the verification of RPA amplification by gel electrophoresis is hampered by the presence of high molecular weight proteins. A postamplification purification step is thus required and it can be achieved for amplicons generated using basic or fpg kits, but not for those from a real-time exo kit because of amplicons degradation by the exo nuclease.",

This allows the simplification of instrumentation and the reduction of costs. Portable user-friendly instruments adapted for RPA reaction exists, the T-8 isothermal device (TwistDx) real-time fluorometer being 1 example. This portable (19 \u00d7 17.5\u2013cm), battery-powered, $5494.5 USD device accommodates 8 RPA reactions per assay, monitors fluorescence in 2 channels, and offers magnetic mixing of RPA reactions (thus enhancing assay sensitivity). Similar to T-8, the T-16 instrument (TwistDx) supports 16 reactions/assay, offers magnetic mixing of RPA reactions as well, and monitors fluorescence in 3 different channels. While being portable, the price of this instrument is estimated to be $8048 USD (68), which is still affordable compared to more expensive thermocyclers (\u2265$30 000 USD). Currently, the cost of a RPA reaction is estimated to be $4.3 USD (51) and TwistDx offers a custom freeze-drying service for RPA reaction pellets, to facilitate the use and market penetration of RPA. This brings RPA a step closer to become a true POC isothermal molecular assay.",

It shows that exploiting a mixture of proteins (n \u2265 7) with known biological functions can reduce instrumentation costs and turnaround time for molecular diagnostics. Compared to the number of proteins involved in performing the thermal cycling of PCR, a savant mixture of 7 to 8 proteins enables the isothermal amplification of DNA or RNA in 5\u201320 min. The low operation temperature (near body temperature) of RPA and its minimal sample preparation requirements, known to tolerate a wide range of biological samples (e.g., serum, stool, urine, milk, nasal, vaginal, plasma, food, plants, and animal tissues) have led to the development of successful applications of the technology in different POC sample-to-answer systems for faster (bedside) diagnostics.",
