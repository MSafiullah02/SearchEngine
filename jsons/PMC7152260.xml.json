As joint disease progresses, attrition of articular cartilage results in decreased width of the joint space (Fig. 21.3\n). These changes in joint space width are rarely diagnosed radiographically as a result of small animal patients not being radiographed while bearing weight and also because of inconsistency between the orientation of the primary x-ray beam and joint space.",

The presence of intraarticular gas is identified more easily during computed tomography (CT) examinations than during radiography.9 Current theory is that noniatrogenic intraarticular gas represents diffusion of nitrogen from extracellular fluid into an adjacent joint space when negative pressure is present in the joint. This may occur naturally or be induced by applying traction to a joint. Vacuum phenomenon has many causes in dogs and cats (Box 21.2\n) and is observed when excessive distraction is applied to the coxofemoral joints during distraction radiography and has been reported in 20% of shoulder radiographs in dogs with osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the humeral head.7, 8 Gas diffusion is likely induced by traction while positioning the shoulder for OCD examination. Interestingly, gas diffusion was not a feature of normal (non-OCD) contralateral joints of dogs in this series.7 Positive clinical associations with intraarticular gas include degenerative disc disease, cervical vertebral instability, osteochondrosis, and degenerative joint disease (Fig. 21.10\n). Intraarticular gas diffuses slowly out of a joint over several hours after normal intraarticular pressure is reestablished.Box \u2022 21.2Causes of Intraarticular GasIatrogenic\nAfter arthrotomy/arthroscopyNegative-contrast arthrographyArthrocentesisTension on jointsPennHIP distraction radiographyPositioning shoulders with OCD for radiography\n\nTrauma\nJoint luxationPenetrating injuries\nInfection\nGas-producing microorganisms\nSpontaneous\nIntervertebral disc diseaseOsteoarthritis\n\nOCD, Osteochondritis dissecans.Alt-text: Box \u2022 21.2",

Thirty-four of 57 cadaver stifles had meniscal mineralization, which was always located in the cranial horn of the medial meniscus. Percentage mineralization of the menisci was significantly correlated with cartilage damage in the medial femoral and tibial condyles. Therefore, feline meniscal mineralization can be associated with medial compartment degenerative joint disease.12\n",

The joint space may be wider during this stage. As a feature of degenerative joint disease, osteophytosis is progressive and is characterized by the greatest degree of change over time in the canine stifle with naturally occurring instability. When grading stifle degenerative joint disease, evaluating changes in number and size of periarticular osteophytes is more reliable than evaluating subchondral sclerosis, intraarticular mineralization, or synovial effusion, but signs of synovial effusion and compression of the infrapatellar fat pad are identifiable radiographic features that often accompany stifle instability.",

Joint laxity may be palpated and visualized radiographically (Figs. 21.26\nand 21.27\n).28, 29 Subsequent radiographic changes are those of degenerative joint disease (Fig. 21.28\n) developing as (1) perichondral osteophyte formation, (2) remodeling of the femoral head and neck, (3) remodeling of the acetabulum, and (4) increased opacity of subchondral bone of the femoral head and acetabulum. A line of enthesophytes on the caudal aspect of the femoral neck, termed the Morgan line, has been described as an early sign of coxofemoral degenerative joint disease (Fig. 21.29\n).30 As the degenerative process advances, the femoral neck becomes thickened, and the surface of the neck becomes irregular as a result of the growth of a collar of perichondral osteophytes. The acetabulum loses its cuplike shape and becomes shallow. Increased bone opacity of subchondral articular surfaces represents bone sclerosis, which is a response to cartilage thinning.

With the dog in dorsal recumbency, the hind limbs are extended with the femurs parallel and the stifles rotated inward so that the patellae are located over the middle of the cranial surface of the distal femur. The x-ray beam should be centered over the coxofemoral joints, and the radiograph should include the entire pelvis and femurs. The pelvis must appear symmetric in the radiograph, without evidence of rotation (see Figs. 21.30A and 21.32).

This neutral position avoids spiral tensioning of the joint capsule that forces the femoral head into the acetabulum and artificially reduces subluxation, a significant disadvantage of the extended hip projection. Hind limbs are held with the femurs positioned neutrally, and a radiograph is made while the coxofemoral joints are compressed to obtain an image of the coxofemoral joints at their most congruent position. A distraction device is then placed between the femurs for the second radiograph (Fig. 21.33\n). When the femurs are pressed against the bars of the distractor, which act as a fulcrum, a lateral force is translated to the proximal femur, and any laxity leads to subluxation that can be visualized radiographically. The two views of the hips are compared, and any coxofemoral laxity is quantified by a unitless measure, the DI. The extended hip projection is also made so that secondary signs of hip dysplasia, such as degenerative joint disease, can be evaluated (Fig. 21.34\n).",

Affected cats become obtunded, apprehensive, reluctant to jump, hypersensitive to neck palpation, and lame. The underlying connective tissue disorder causes vertebral ankylosis and an ankylosing degenerative joint disease of the forelimbs. Recognizable radiographic manifestations of hypervitaminosis A may be seen in as little as 10 weeks after introduction of a diet rich in vitamin A. Changes include ankylosing spondylopathy of the cervical and cranial thoracic vertebral column and periarticular enthesopathy and degenerative joint disease of shoulder and elbow joints (Figs. 21.45\nand 21.46\n). In advanced disease, the additional bone becomes incorporated seamlessly with existing bone so that architecture of the original bones is remodeled completely. Other regions of the vertebral column and other joints of the appendicular skeleton may become involved, but the aforementioned bones and joints appear to be the primary site of bony changes in cats.

Both dogs and cats can be affected by MPS, but the best-studied animal form is the feline form of mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS-VI). It causes polyarthropathies because of faulty cartilage formation, which is a result of dermatan sulfate accumulation in connective tissue because of deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulphatase. The morphologic appearance of affected cats ranges from normal to short-legged dwarfs with facial dysmorphism. Feline MPS-VI has two genotypes. The least affected phenotype ranges from being physically and clinically normal to having degenerative joint disease of the shoulder and stifle joints. The classic form produces phenotypic features of dwarfism and facial dysmorphia. These cats tend to have lameness and develop hind limb paresis. Radiographic abnormalities reflect epiphyseal dysplasia and range from degenerative joint disease in the shoulder and stifle to gross malformation of the appendicular and axial skeleton (Figs. 21.47\nand 21.48\n). Severely affected animals are osteopenic. Subchondral bone of articular surfaces is distorted, and periarticular soft tissue mineralization is common. A high level of lysosomal storage in chondrocytes adversely affects mineralization of matrix during enchondral ossification, resulting in epiphyseal dysplasia and distortion of epiphyses of the appendicular skeleton. Vertebral malformation is a recognizable feature of feline MPS-VI. Vertebral bodies are short and square, the pedicles elongated, and articular processes malformed. Epiphyseal dysplasia causes distortion of the epiphyses of vertebral bodies. New bone formation around articular processes and ankylosing spondylopathy are common.",

In extreme forms, the polyarthropathy caused by SFCOD can be crippling, and affected animals can be disinclined to ambulate and unable to jump. Defective cartilage formation manifests skeletal changes that affect joints and entheses. Joints of the distal limbs are affected most spectacularly, but some long bones (such as, the metacarpi, metatarsi, and phalanges) may also develop abnormally (Fig. 21.49\n). Large enthesophytes can form around joints at points of tendinous origin or insertion (entheses). An ankylosing arthropathy frequently results in fusion of the carpi and tarsi (Fig. 21.50\n) and their articulations with the metacarpi and metatarsi. Malformed bones in the manus and pes may not grow to a normal length, and these bones may appear shorter and fatter than normal. Vertebral malformation can also occur in the tail, where the caudal vertebrae may be short and wide. Spondylopathy of the caudal vertebrae may combine to produce a tail that is short and relatively inflexible.41\n",

It has a variety of clinical manifestations, including polyarthritis, anemia, nephropathy, skin disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, and lymphadenopathy.47 Diagnosis of SLE is complicated and is made on the basis of the concurrence of clinical manifestations and serologic evidence. In one study, 121 dogs with a diagnosis of SLE were reviewed, and joint disease was reported to be the most frequent clinical sign (69%), followed by hematologic (53%), renal (50%), cutaneous (33%), and intrathoracic (17%) manifestations. The arthropathy that occurs in canine SLE is usually nonerosive and effusive. Polyarthritis is typical, but monoarticular arthritis has been reported. Affected joints may be swollen, painful, and warm. The joints most commonly affected are the carpus, tarsus, metatarsus, stifle, and elbow. Radiographic signs are usually absent or are minimal. In chronic SLE, the joint space of affected joints may be narrowed, and the joint capsule is distended. A mild periosteal response has been reported at the junction of joint capsule and bone.",

The stifle, elbow, shoulder, and hip joints are affected to a lesser extent. During the first month, periarticular soft tissue swelling is the predominant sign. Swelling may be either intracapsular or extracapsular. One to 3 months after the onset of clinical signs, periosteal new bone production may be identified at site of joint capsule attachment. During this phase, bone adjacent to affected joints may have decreased opacity and a coarse trabecular pattern. Perichondral new bone formation is pronounced 2 to 3 months after onset of the disease. Extensive enthesopathy may bridge smaller joint spaces. More severe radiographic manifestations include perichondral bone erosion and formation of subchondral cysts. Narrowing of affected joint spaces may occur late.46 Radiographic signs of the periosteal proliferative form of feline chronic progressive polyarthritis include periarticular soft tissue swelling, periosteal new bone formation, perichondral enthesophyte production, perichondral and subchondral erosion, subchondral cysts, osteopenia of bone adjacent to affected joints, and narrowed joint spaces (Fig. 21.55\n).",

Nonneoplastic causes of hypertrophic osteopathy include inflammatory lung disease (e.g., blastomycosis), intrathoracic foreign bodies, Dirofilaria immitis infestation, and spirocercosis. The pathogenesis of hypertrophic osteopathy is understood incompletely. New bone formation typically commences on the distal end of both short and long tubular bones and progresses proximally.
