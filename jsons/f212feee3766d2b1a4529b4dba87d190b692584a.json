Current results about the mechanisms of action underlying their antiviral properties suggest a combination of effects on both the virus and the host cell. Flavonoids have been reported to affect virus binding, entry, replication, viral protein translation, formation of certain virus envelope glycoprotein complexes and virus release (Andres et al. 2009 ) .

Similarly, EGCG and ECG inhibited the neuraminidase activity more effectively than the EGC (Song et al. 2005 ) .

In addition, EGCG has not only potential use as adjunctive therapy in HIV-1 infection (Williamson et al. 2006 ) , but has greater anti-HSV activity than other green tea catechins and inactivates multiple clinical isolates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 by binding to gB, gD, or another envelope glycoprotein, it appears to be a promising candidate for use in a microbicide to reduce HSV transmission (Isaacs et al. 2008 ) .
