            "text": "The modification of proteins with the small 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin (Ub) plays a central role in many key cellular processes. Ubiquitylation of a target protein requires the concerted action of a cascade of three enzymes (Figure 1\n). The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) catalyzes the formation of a reactive thioester bond via its active site cysteine residue and the C-terminal carboxylate of ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), which in conjunction with a ubiquitin ligase (E3) confers substrate specificity. In this step the C-terminus of ubiquitin is coupled to the \u025b-amine of a lysine residue in the target protein, forming an isopeptide. Alternatively the C-terminus of ubiquitin is coupled to the N-terminus of ubiquitin resulting in a regular peptide bond, often refered to as linear. The modification of a protein with a single ubiquitin molecule (monoubiquitylation) has been shown to be required for internalization of cell surface receptors, such as the EGF receptor, as well as for DNA repair and regulation of transcription through modification of histones [1] Ubiquitin can also be coupled to itself via any of its seven lysine residues or its N-terminus. Multiple self-conjugations lead to the formation of polyubiquitin chains. These chains can either be linked homotypically through one specific residue in each module or heterotypically through a selection of different residues in each module, including multiple residues per chain forming a branched chain. There are at least 37 E2 and >600 E3 enzymes encoded in the human genome. Their specific pairing determines the type of chain linkage that is formed as well as which protein substrate is modified. Some homotypic chains have been well studied. Lys48-linked chains target proteins to the proteasome for degradation while Lys63-linked chains have functions in DNA repair. Lys11, Lys29 and N-terminally linked (linear) ubiquitin chains play roles in cell cycle control and signaling. The function of other linkage types is less clear, especially when it comes to heterotypic chains [1]. Ubiquitin modification is reversed by the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which cleave the isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the side chain of a lysine residue in a substrate or another ubiquitin module. DUBs are divided in five classes: USP, UCH, OTU, Josephin and JAMM/MPN+ proteases. Except for the JAMM/MPN+ class, which are Zn2+ metallo-proteases, all DUBs known so far are cysteine proteases. The activity of DUBs is tightly controlled. A large group of DUBs is regulated through reversible oxidation of the catalytic residue [2, 3], while the activity of OTUD5 is regulated by its phosphorylation status [4]. Approximately 100 DUBs are encoded in the human genome and for many of them specific functions remain to be determined [5, 6]. The OTU class of DUBs shows remarkable selectivity for specific ubiquitin chains and is likely involved in chain editing or recycling of specifically linked chains [7\u2022\u2022]. The largest class of DUBs, the USP-class, does not exhibit significant linkage specificity but possibly function in a substrate-specific manner [8, 9]. Polyubiquitylation plays an important part in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity signaling pathways. The pathways that signal through tumor necrosis factor receptor, IL1 receptor, Toll-like receptor and T cell receptor are modulated by different modes of polyubiquitylation. These pathways effectively regulate the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which mediates the transcription of proteins involved in cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, inflammatory response, or apoptosis. Some examples of polyubiquitylation in these pathways are Lys63-polyubiquitylation of the kinase RIP, Met1-linked polyubiquitylation of NEMO, and Lys48-polyubiquitylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and the NF-\u03baB precursor. All these modifications have different outcomes, which together with the rest of the pathway have been extensively reviewed previously [10, 11, 12].",

            "text": "Besides ubiquitin, several ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) are known that have an important function in immunity. Ubls are conjugated and deconjugated through mechanisms similar to the ubiquitylation cascade, sometimes sharing components with the ubiquitin pathway. The Ubls SUMO and Nedd8 are also involved in the NF-\u03baB pathway. Nedd8 modification of the E3 SCF ligase complex is required for the recruitment of E2 and ubiquitylation of I\u03baB\u03b1. On the other hand, SUMO modification of I\u03baB\u03b1 counteracts ubiquitylation at the same lysine residue, adding another regulatory step in this complex pathway [13]. ISG15, one of the first identified Ubls, is upregulated by type I interferon stimulation during infection [14, 15, 16]. It consists of two Ub-like domains connected by a small linker and plays an important role in the defense against viral and bacterial infections, possibly by modification of viral and host proteins. However, the exact function of ISGylation remains largely unclear [17]. FAT10 is another Ubl implicated in immune defense and also consists of two Ub-like modules. It is expressed in mature dendritic cells and B cells, and expression can be induced by IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1. Mono-FATylated proteins are targeted to the proteasome for degradation [18]. Thus far, no deconjugating enzyme has been identified.",

For example, the Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) tegument protein UL36 possesses deubiquitylating activity [19], which is conserved in homologs found in murine cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr Virus [20]. The SARS coronavirus PLpro processing protease acts on a broad range of ubiquitylated and ISG15ylated host proteins and is required for viral replication [21, 22]. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus harbors an OTU-like DUB which acts as both a deubiquitylase and a deISGylase [23, 24, 25]. In addition, Yersinia virulence factor YopJ has deubiquitylating activity that results in deubiquitylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and hence inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling [26, 27]. Moreover, Chlamydia trachomatis expresses two DUB-like proteases that possess deubiquitylating and deneddylating activity [28].",

Often trypsin is used in these reactions, which removes the last two glycine residues of ubiquitin under native conditions [29]. During the cleavage reaction, an intermediate ester is formed with the active-site serine residue. This intermediate ester can undergo a transpeptidation reaction resulting in a new peptide bond with an amine nucleophile of choice, if a large amount of nucleophile is present. The fluorogenic substrate Ub-AMC has initially been synthesized using this method [30]. Another method uses intein chemistry for a more convenient preparation of reactive ubiquitin thioester intermediates [31]. These intermediates can be chemically converted to introduce a reactive group in the synthesis of ubiquitin-based active site-directed probes. Intein chemistry is generally preferred over transpeptidation methods as it is more generally applicable [32, 33, 34].",

These ubiquitin-based probes are suicide substrates that specifically react with the active site cysteine nucleophile of DUBs in an activity-based manner. Their covalent nature can be used to visualize and purify an entire family of active proteins simultaneously. ABPs contain three essential elements (Figure 2A). The targeting element confers specificity for the desired enzyme targets. In the case of DUB probes, the targeting element is ubiquitin. Secondly, the reactive group or warhead, which reacts with the active site of the target enzyme after the targeting element has bound. Finally, a recognition or retrieval element is incorporated to allow for the selective retrieval or visualization of the enzyme-ABP complex [34]. The first of these ubiquitin ABPs was ubiquitin-nitrile, which allowed the labeling of a proteasome-bound cysteine dependent DUB [36]. Many improvements to probe design and synthesis have been reported since [32, 33, 34, 37\u2022\u2022]. For instance, these developments led to the discovery that OTU class enzymes act as deubiquitylases [38].",

The introduction of a chemically inert terminal alkyne moiety at the C-terminus of ubiquitin (Ub-Prg) renders it highly reactive toward deubiquitylating enzymes. It was shown that this novel Ub-Prg probe reacts with all classes of cysteine DUBs. An advantage of this alkyne-based probe is that it is very reactive toward DUBs but does not react with unrelated Cys-proteases under the same conditions. Further reviews on general ABP chemistry can be found elsewhere [40].",

Using the same principle, De Jong et al. [42] demonstrated that the DUB inhibitor b-AP15 has little selectivity among DUBs (Figure 2C).

An important technology enabling the synthesis of natively isopeptide-linked assay reagents is the use of native chemical ligation (NCL) as depicted in Figure 3A. In an NCL a native peptide bond is formed between two peptides, one containing a C-terminal thioester and another containing an N-terminal cysteine residue [44]. To generate diubiquitin modules, which are normally linked through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and the \u025b-amine of lysine, this technology needed to be adapted. By introducing a thiolysine residue (Figure 3B) that harbors a thiol moiety positioned either at the \u03b4- or \u03b3-position of a lysine residue (Figure 3C) in the sequence of ubiquitin, an acceptor ubiquitin is created onto which a ubiquitin molecule can be ligated [35, 45, 46, 47]. With this technology, all isopeptide-linked ubiquitin chain topologies can be synthesized chemically.",

These allow for selective recognition of different ubiquitin chain topologies and hence the correct positioning of a polyubiquitylated substrate. The proposed S1 and S1\u2032 sites position a polyubiquitin chain across the active-site to allow cleavage between ubiquitin molecules in a chain. The S1\u2032 site binds the ubiquitin moiety C-terminal to the scissile bond and the distal ubiquitin moiety in the chain will bind the S1 site. For cleavage of polyubiquitin chains from a substrate, S1 and S2 binding pockets are likely used. The most proximal ubiquitin in the chain binds to the S1 site and the more distal ubiquitin binds to the S2 site. In this manner the chain is positioned such that the bond between chain and substrate can be cleaved. The previously described monoubiquitin-based probes only bind the S1 site (Figure 4A, second panel) and therefore provide no information on linkage specificity. The recently developed diubiquitin-based probes are all designed to bind the S1 and S1\u2032 sites (Figure 4A, third panel), after which the DUB active site thiol reacts with the internal warhead.",

In a quantitative proteomics analysis of HEK293T cell lysate, they quantified the relative selectivity of 28 DUBs for the various ubiquitin linkages. While reported data from diubiquitin turnover assays shows overlap with the apparent linkage preferences observed, there are some major differences.

These differences are often observed and an important point of further investigation.",

Recent developments in this direction involve tuning of the affinity for ubiquitin by creating ubiquitin mutants that act as rather selective DUB inhibitors [54\u2022\u2022, 55\u2022\u2022]. The ubiquitin linkage specificity of DUBs remains an intriguing field of research and many studies have focused on the involvement of the S1 and S1\u2032 ubiquitin binding pockets. However, for certain DUBs it has been shown that there is a significant contribution of the S1 and S2 pockets [7\u2022\u2022].
