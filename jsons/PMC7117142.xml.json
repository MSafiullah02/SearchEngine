In addition, significant genetic heterogeneity exists even within the two main groupings of `American' and `European,' so that sequence analysis, but currently not MAb-typing, allows sub-typing of PRRSV to even finer geographical levels (Meng et al., 1995; Kapur et al., 1996; Suarez et al., 1996).",

The emergence of an apparently pathogenic, hitherto unrecognized PRRSV-type in Denmark increased the demand for accurate typing of virus isolates. Isolation of PRRSV on cell cultures and typing with MAbs offer a combination of sturdiness, sensitivity and accuracy that, in our opinion, is unlikely to be greatly improved upon. However, in selected diagnostic cases, as well as in many research situations, the sensitivity and accurate typing afforded by RT-PCR techniques would be highly desirable. Also, cell culture methods may not be well suited to examine seminal shedding of PRRSV, due to a high content of cytotoxic compounds in this material.",

RNA was recovered from GnSCN using acid-treated silica particles (Boom et al., 1990; Legeay et al., 1997). In our hands, the silica method yielded superior results to acid phenol/chloroform extraction, particularly for PRRSV RNA extraction from semen. 5 \u03bcl silica suspension was added to the cleared sample in GnSCN buffer, and incubated for 20 min on a rotating spear. The silica was washed twice with 1 ml GnSCN buffer, twice with 1 ml 70% ethanol and once with 1 ml absolute ethanol.

Finally, the silica was pelleted by spinning samples for 5 min at 11 g in a microcentrifuge, and 28 \u03bcl of the supernatant (referred to as RNA below) was used for cDNA synthesis.",

PRRSV infection results in transient viraemia (reaching 1.000 TCID50\n ml\u22121 serum), with replication of virus occurring preferentially in lung macrophages (up to 1.000 TCID50\n g\u22121 lung tissue at peak viral replication 7\u201314 days post-infection) (Duan et al., 1997; Nielsen et al., 1997). Also, characteristically for the Arteriviruses to which PRRSV belongs, the virus is intermittently excreted in semen for long periods of time, in currently unknown quantities (Swenson et al., 1994; Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995a; Gradil et al., 1996; Nielsen et al., 1997; Sur et al., 1997). Therefore, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test was evaluated on 10-fold serial dilutions of the reference viruses 111/92 (EU-type) and VR2332 (US-type) in clinically relevant materials such as whole boar semen (Fig. 3\n).",

Yet, the value of the test would be greatly enhanced if ORF 7 PCR could also distinguish between infection with a single PRRSV-type, and concomitant infection in the same animal with US- and EU-types. The use of size polymorphy in an ORF 7 amplicon to type PRRSV viruses was first described by Mardassi et al., but these authors did not investigate the applicability of the technique to double infection. The results in Fig. 4\nshows that ORF 7 PCR in fact correctly identified mixed-infection situations by displaying both size variants of the ORF 7 amplicon (compare lanes 2, 4 and 6). In the experiment shown in Fig. 4, 3% of a minority-type was detected in a mixed population (see Lanes 3 and 5. The US-type band in Lane 3 was clearly visible on the original photo). Further experiments indicated that a 1 : 100 ratio between viruses (measured in TCID50) resulted in the simultaneous appearance of both size variants of the ORF 7 amplicon, whereas a 1 : 1.000 ratio between viruses lay below the resolving ability of the ORF 7 PCR. Importantly, judged by eye, the ratio between viruses was reflected in relative intensities of ORF 7 bands (compare Lanes 3, 4 and 5). The difference in intensities of ORF 7 bands from the minor virus population in Lanes 3 (very faint band from 3% US-type PRRSV) and 5 (somewhat stronger band from 3% EU-type PRRSV) most likely reflected the uncertainty in titrating stock viruses, which would be expected to figure very prominently in this type of analysis. Thus, the ORF 7 PCR was able not only to identify a mixed population, but also to provide semi-quantitative information about the population composition in the sample.",

This situation requires that diagnostic tests be able to detect as well as precisely type the PRRSV virus. Virus isolation on PPAM and MARC monolayers is currently the gold standard of virus detection; yet, some PRRSV-containing materials (such as semen) contain too high levels of cytotoxic compounds to be reliably screened by tissue culture methods (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995b; Nielsen et al., 1997; Shin et al., 1997). Typing PRRSV isolates with EU-type specific and US-type-specific MAbs is a rapid and accurate method; however, finer sub-typing of virus is not currently possible with this method, excluding detailed epidemiological studies. Although a number of RT-PCR tests for PRRSV have been published by others, the current situation in Denmark (co-existence of European and American-type PRRSV) poses unique requirements, particularly for precise differentiation of European, wildtype-American and vaccine-American PRRSV. Thus, the RT-PCR test described above was tailored to specifically address these diagnostic concerns.",

It should be mentioned that since clinical material such as serum and lung homogenate contain up to 1000 TCID50\n ml\u22121 during the peak of viral replication at 10\u201314 days post-infection, the RT-PCR test is expected to have up to a 100-fold excess of sensitivity for direct detection of PRRSV in the tissues of infected pigs, without any need for nested PCR. These calculations were supported by preliminary semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis: sera, lung homogenates and semen from PRRSV-infected pigs at 10\u201314 days post-infection could be diluted 10\u2013100-fold, and still be detected positive by ORF 7 RT-PCR.

Theoretical considerations strongly support that ORF 7 PCR should exhibit bias-less detection: detection of all types is accomplished by the same RT-PCR primers, and the ORF 7 amplicons from EU- and US-types exhibit similar GC content and only a slight (4%) size difference, suggesting similar amplification efficiencies in RT-PCR.

Although the test was optimized to avoid unspecific bands, and did not show cross-reactivity to a number of relevant viruses (see Section 2), it can be anticipated that additional examination of the specificity of an amplicon may be required. For this purpose, RFLP analysis offers a very simple and attractive alternative to the more impractical techniques of sequencing, Southern blotting or nested PCR. In fact, the relatively large amplicon size in our test (637\u2013818 bp) provides an ideal target for RFLP. For example, analysis of our own as well as GeneBank ORF 7 sequences (total of 61 European- and 19 American-type) predicts that the digestion of the ORF 7 amplicon produced in our test with a single, inexpensive restriction enzyme (HaeII), could provide discrimination between US- (215 and 445 nt fragments) and EU-types (299 and 338 nt fragments). Also, the ORF 7 sequence data indicated that a 29 mer oligonucleotide (5\u2032 AT GGC CAG CCA GTC AAT CA A/G CTG TGC AAG 3\u2032) would hybridize to an internal, highly conserved sequence in ORF 7 amplicons from EU as well as US viruses.
