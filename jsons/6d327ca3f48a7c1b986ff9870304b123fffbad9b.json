About 80 % of Singapore's population resides in high-rise buildings (Asian Disaster Reduction Center 2005) . A major disaster of any sort could inflict mass casualties and extensive destruction to properties in Singapore. Clearly, like its neighboring countries, Singapore is also vulnerable to both natural and man-made disasters alongside its remarkable economic growth. The potential risks may result from its dense population, intricate transportation network, or a transnational communicable disease. Moreover, Singapore can be affected by the situations in surrounding countries.

Chief among these, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 was the most devastating. The SARS outbreak brought about far-reaching public health and economic consequences for the country as a whole. Fortunately, the outbreak was eventually contained through a series of risk mitigating measures introduced by the Singapore government and the responsiveness of all Singaporeans.

To achieve our research objective, we utilized a triangulation strategy of various research methodologies. To understand the principles and practices of Singapore's approach to disaster risk management, we carry out an historical analysis of official documents obtained from the relevant Singapore government agencies as well as international organizations, literature reviews, quantitative analysis of economic impacts, qualitative interviews with key informants (e.g. public health professionals and decision-makers), and email communications with frontline managers from the public sector (e.g. the Singapore Civil Defense Force, the Communicable Disease Centre) and non-governmental organizations. The authors also employed the 'cultural insider' approach by participating in epidemic control procedures against SARS. 1 In particular, we use the method of case study to illuminate Singapore's approach to disaster risk management. The rationale of doing a case study of SARS along with Singapore's all-hazard approach is that the case study can best showcase the contextual differences, those being political, economic, and social. This case study aims to highlight the lessons drawn from past experiences in a specific context and timeframe, through which we are able to focus more on the nature of the risks, and the processes and the impacts of the disaster risk management and policy intervention.

Applying the approach to a case study, our research enriches the vocabulary of risk management, adding to the body of knowledge on disaster management specific to the region of Southeast Asia. Indeed, the dominant perspective in this field holds that the state must be able to exercise brute force and impose its will on the population (Lai and Tan 2012) . However, as shown in our paper, this dominant perspective is incomplete as the exercise of authority and power from the government is not necessarily sufficient to contain the transmission of transnational communicable diseases.

Even though more cases were reported, the STI climbed progressively up 86 points over the next fortnight, eclipsing the earlier falls. This could be attributed to the strict measures which the Singapore government introduced. The STI remained relatively stable over the immediate fortnight as new cases were reported. However, it started a downward plunge over the following fortnight as the number of cases peaked once more. The STI plunged 96 points. However, the resilience of the STI was shown when it climbed back up, surpassing the level reported at the beginning of the SARS period. The volatility of the STI demonstrates the vulnerability of a small open economy from exogenous forces-in this case, the SARS epidemic. SARS was the one single activity which contributed to the volatility of Singapore's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2003. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) revised the forecast for Singapore's annual GDP growth down from 3 to 0.5 %. This forecast was later revised upwards to 2.5 %. There were a number of channels by which the SARS epidemic affected the economy. The economic impacts will be discussed from the positions of demand and supply shocks. The main economic impact of the SARS outbreak was on the demand side, as consumption and the demand for services declined (Henderson 2003) . The economic consequence caused fear and anxiety among Singaporeans and potential tourists to Singapore. The hardest and most directly hit were the tourism, retail, hospitality and transportrelated industries, for example airline, cruise, hotel, restaurant, travel agent, retail and taxi services, and their auxiliary industries (see Fig. 15 .3 and This had a direct impact on hotel occupancy rates, which declined sharply to 30 % in late April 2003. Cancellation or postponement of tourism events increased by about 30-40 %. Revenues of restaurants dropped by 50 % while revenues of the travel agents decreased by 70 %. SARS had an uneven impact on various sectors of the economy. A four-tiered framework to assess the impact on the respective sectors showed that Tier 1 industries, such as the tourism and travel-related industries were most severely hit. Tier 1 industries account for 3.5 % of GDP. The Tier 2 industries, such as restaurants, retail and land transport industries were significantly hit, which account for 7.5 % of GDP. The next two tiers were less directly affected by the SARS outbreak. Tier 3 industries include real estate and stock broking, which account for close to 19 % of GDP. The remaining 70 % of the domestic economy in Tier 4 includes manufacturing, construction and communications. These industries were not directly impacted by the outbreak of SARS.

The trend for visitor inflow is that visitor inflows fall sharply. This is especially true in the case of Singapore, when visitor stays tend to be shorter and the high-end visitors stayed away. As a result, tourism and other related industries were nearly crippled due to a significant reduction in both leisure and business travel. Visitors from around the world cancelled or postponed their trips to Singapore, causing a drastic decrease of total expenditure from visitors. (See Table 15 .2) Plummeting visitor arrivals directly impacted hotel occupancy rates, which declined sharply to 30 % in late April (See Table 15 .3). The hotel occupancy rate plummeted from 72 to 42 %, compared to the normal level of 70 % or above. The annual averages for hotel occupancy rates were 74.4 % in 2002, 67.3 % in 2003, and 80.6 % in 2004 .

Therefore, a fall in demand of goods and services is likely to bring about a fall in the supply of such goods and services. Also, the loss of consumer and business confidence would reduce the level of aggregate demand. These effects were observed as the manufacturing industry experienced supply chain disruptions as the Singaporean economy and employment market continued to weaken. Singapore was taken off the WHO's list of SARS affected countries on 31st May 2003-one of the first countries to be removed from the list. With the \"fear-factor\" managed, normal daily activities slowly resumed. SARS affected industries and sectors started to show signs of recovery towards the end of the second quarter in 2003. A more comprehensive analysis of the economic costs of SARS will need to consider the direct impact on consumer spending and indirect repercussions of the shock on trade and investment (Asian Development Bank Outlook 2003). The economic costs from a global disease, such as SARS, go beyond the immediate impacts incurred in the affected sectors of disease-inflicted countries. This is not just because the disease spreads quickly across countries through networks related to global travel, but also because any economic shocks to one country spread quickly to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalization. However, just calculating the number of cancelled tourist trips, the declines in retail trade, and some of the factors discussed earlier do not provide a complete picture of the impact of SARS. This is because there are close linkages within economies, across sectors, and across economies in both international trade and international capital flows. Thus, analyzing the tourism sector alone may not be sufficient in analyzing the overall financial impact of SARS. SARS inflicted a heavy toll on businesses and immediately impacted severely the viability of business. Businesses lost employees for long periods of time due to factors such as illness, the need to care for family members and fear of infection at work, or retrenchment. As the workforce shrunk due to absenteeism, business operations, for example supply chain, flow of goods worldwide and provision of services, were all affected both locally and internationally. In terms of retrenchment, the job prospects of employees in affected companies appeared miserable. A survey performed during the SARS period showed that the jobless rate increased more than 5.5 %, the highest for the last decade in Singapore (Ministry of Manpower, Singapore 2003) . In absolute numbers, overall employment diminished by 25,963 in the second quarter of 2003, the largest quarterly decline since the mid-1980s recession. Unlike previous retrenchment that affected mainly blue-collar labor, SARS also affected whitecollar employees too. The implementation of workplace SARS control measures added to operational and administrative costs. For example, the policy of temperature taking was implemented at workplaces in the private sector. Numerous private establishments installed thermal-scanners in their entrances from day one. However, such precautionary measures were necessary to contain the disease. This helped to restore business confidence and investment potential (a lower level of investments will lead to slower capital growth). But the reduction in an economy's capacity may linger on for a few quarters before it is restored to pre-SARS levels. The loss of productive working days from quarantine, and implementation costs incurred to monitor movements of employees contributed to the reduction in the aggregate supply front. Some of these economic effects may have worsened the public health situation if strategic planning was not in place.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2573, "end": 2611, "text": "(Ministry of Manpower, Singapore 2003)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Economic Impact"}, {"text": "SARS reduced levels of service and care in Singapore's healthcare system as the system mobilized its medical resources to deal with the SARS epidemic.

During the peak of SARS from mid-March 2003 to early April 2003, there was a shortage of medical and nursing professionals because (1) the demand for care of influenza patients substantially increased, and (2) the supply of healthcare manpower decreased as some were also affected by the epidemic.

Such uncertainty of contracting a highly contagious disease actually deteriorated the fear of security breaches, and the panic of overexposure (Tan 2006) . Responding to the uncertainty of disease transmission, the Singapore government instituted many draconian public policies, such as social distancing, quarantine and isolation, as risk mitigating measures. All of these control measures created an instinctive withdrawal from society for the general population. This brought about a behavior which resulted in the public avoiding crowds and public places with human interaction. On 24 March 2003, the MOH invoked the Infectious Disease Act (IDA) to isolate all those who had been exposed to SARS patients. After IDA was invoked, on 25 March 2003, schools and non-essential public places were closed. Public events were cancelled to prevent close contact in crowds. Singaporeans with contact history were asked to stay home for a period of time to prevent transmission. Harsh penalties, such as hefty fines of more than USD4,000 or imprisonment, were imposed on those who defied quarantine orders. In a drastic move reminiscent of a police state, closedcircuit cameras were installed in the houses of those ordered to stay home to monitor their compliance with the quarantine order (ABC News Online 2003). At the height of SARS, 12,194 suspected cases were ordered to stay home, all of whom were monitored either by cameras or in less severe cases, by telephone calls. Quarantine, regardless of its effectiveness, received strong criticism from the general public during the outbreak of SARS due to the invasive nature of that measure (Duncanson 2003) . Impact of social distancing remains unclear, but WHO has recommended such control measures depending on the severity of the epidemic, risk groups affected and epidemiology of transmission (World Health Organization 2005). Singapore's MOH advocated the practice of social distancing during the outbreak of SARS.

The bureaucratic structure in place then was severely inadequate in terms of handling a situation that was both fluid and unprecedented; indeed, fighting SARS required more than a medical approach because resources had to be drawn from agencies other than the MOH. Accordingly, a three-tiered national control structure was created in response to SARS-these tiers were individually represented by the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), the Core Executive Group (CEG) and the Inter-Ministry SARS Operations Committee (IMOC) (Tay and Mui 2004) . The nine-member IMC was chaired by the Minister of Home Affairs (MHA) and it fulfilled three major functions: (1) to develop strategic decisions, (2) to approve these major decisions, and (3) to implement control measures. 4 Notably, the IMC also played the role of an interagency coordinator overseeing the activities of other ministries and their subsidiaries. On 7 April 2003 (5 weeks after the first case of SARS was reported), the CEG and a ministerial committee was formed. The CEG was chaired by the Permanent Secretary of Home Affairs and consisted of elements from three other ministries: the MOH, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). In particular, the role of the CEG was to manage the SARS epidemic by directing valuable resources to key areas. The IMOC, meanwhile, was seminal in carrying out health control measures issued by the IMC (see Fig. 15 .4 below). The MOH, at the operational layer, formed an Operations Group responsible for the planning and coordination of health services, and operation in peacetime.

In the case of a broad outbreak, IDA made it legally permissible to enforce mandatory health examination and treatment, exchange of medical information and cooperation between healthcare providers and the MOH, and the quarantine and isolation of SARS patients (Infectious Disease Act 2003). In particular, the government amended the IDA on 24 April 2003 requiring all those who had come into contact with SARS patients to remain indoors or report immediately to designated medical institutions for quarantine (Ministry of Health, Singapore 2003b) .

All in all, the IDA played an adaptive role in terms of facilitating a swift response to the outbreak of this particular epidemic.

The national healthcare system prioritized life-saving resources such as medicine and medical equipment to allocate manpower and protective equipment to the TTSH.

Two aspects of SARS warranted government intervention to mitigate economic impact. First, the information that needs to be collected and disseminated to effectively assess SARS displays the characteristics of public good. Second, there are negative externalities related to contagious diseases in the sense that they affect third parties in market transactions. Public good and negative externalities are typical areas where government action is needed (Fan 2003) . There are three major factors which can explain why some economies are more vulnerable and susceptible to the effect of SARS than others (Asian Development Bank Outlook 2003) . These factors are structural issues (e.g. shares of tourism in GDP and the composition of consumer spending), initial consumer sentiments, and government responses. As the research shows, the Singapore government implemented a USD 132 million (SGD 231 million in 2003) SARS relief package to reduce the costs for tourism operators and its auxiliary services. On the other hand, an economic relief package worth USD 131m (SGD 230m) was created to aid businesses hit by SARS. 5 In addition, the government incurred USD$109m (SGD 192m) in direct operating expenditure related to SARS, and committed another USD 60m (SGD105m) development expenditure of hospitals for additional isolation rooms and medical facilities to treat SARS and other infectious diseases.

Health authorities in Singapore encountered this same problem. But with the aid of WHO technical advisors, Singapore managed to establish in a timely manner identification and reporting procedures. Furthermore, the MOH also expanded the WHO's definitions for suspected cases of SARS (to include any healthcare workers with fever and/or respiratory symptoms) in order to widen the surveillance net (Goh et al. 2006) .
