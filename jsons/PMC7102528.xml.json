Ventilatory assistance is required in about 10% of the hospitalized patients, and the mortality rate in patients requiring ventilator assistance, younger than 75 years of age, without major comorbidity, is minimal. So, it is difficult to determine the number of ICU beds needed, but no country in the world, so far, has had enough ICU beds. This has been, and is, a major problem for Northern Italy.",

In Italy, many doctors and nurses were contaminated so they had to stop working. Again, it is difficult to determine the real prevalence of doctors and nurses who were contaminated. Covid-19 diagnosis should be performed in all nurses and doctors, because the disease often does not manifest in people younger than 35 years of age, and doctors and nurses can carry the disease all over the hospital.",

Often Covid-19 patients have been admitted through the emergency room to common wards, before a diagnosis was made, and they were isolated. In this period, the possibility of a diffuse contamination of the hospital workers is highly probable. The best solution is to have hospitals devoted only to Covid-19 patients, and to have emergency rooms in which patients with suspected Covid-19 infection are evaluated.",
