It emerges that a country's trajectory during an initial first month \"priming period\" largely determines how the situation unfolds subsequently. We also propose a method for forecasting case counts, which takes advantage of the common, latent information in the entire sample of curves, instead of just the history of a single country. Our framework facilitates to quantify the effects of demographic covariates and social mobility on doubling rates and case fatality rates through a time-varying regression model. Decreased workplace mobility is associated with lower doubling rates with a roughly two week delay, and case fatality rates exhibit a positive feedback pattern.",

In recent work [9, 10] the basic reproduction number and doubling time have been studied in a dynamic manner by considering a varying coefficient model with daily new cases as the response and time as a predictor. Similar work has considered the real-time estimation of case fatality rate using Poisson mixture models [11] . Our analysis complements these studies and we propose an alternative way of obtaining relevant dynamic quantities. Associating metrics of disease progression with baseline covariates is also of central interest. Recent research has queried the effects of population age, temperature, humidity [12, 13] , community mobility patterns [14, 15] and other factors on the spread of the virus. Modeling the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 based on predictors is key to understanding the impact of distancing practices and other policies on spread mitigation and prevention.",

We use FDA methodology to study patterns of growth for 5 case counts and to quantify the performance of various countries as the pandemic progresses. We also showcase an approach for predicting future case counts which may be used to understand whether a country is doing better or worse than expected. Finally, we explore the role of variables such as population density, fraction of the population over 65 and mobility reduction efforts for the spread of the infection as it varies over time.

These archetypes are derived from the extreme ends of the two main modes of variation [25, 26] observed for the sample, which emerge from functional principal component analysis (FPCA, Figure 2 ). FPCA is similar to ordinary principal component analysis in the sense that it projects high dimensional curve data into a low dimensional space, representing them as a random vector of functional principal component (FPC) scores (see Methods). These scores are matched with smooth eigenfunctions, which reveal the primary patterns of variation in the sample of functional objects. For the case load trajectories, a 2-dimensional representation was found to adequately represent 6 the sample of cumulative case trajectories.",

The mean curve in Figure 6 indicates monotone declining doubling rates, so countries which did not have many cases in this period tend to catch up to the mean behaviour. Doubling rates are for the most part positively correlated with the size of the decline in workplace mobility with a lag of 13 days, which suggests that reduced mobility may significantly slow the growth rate of confirmed cases, though this benefit is only seen approximately 2 weeks later.

Domains where the observed doubling rate is higher than the predicted indicate periods when the countries are doing worse than expected. The doubling rate of most countries is less predictable in the early stage but can be very well predicted later on, which may be partly a consequence of the dynamic regression to the mean effect as visualized in the left panel of Figure 6 . Countries with relatively poorly predicted trajectories include Japan, India, Egypt, the Philippines and the US. This may be due to low testing rates, where the testing rate in Japan is reported to be much lower than other countries. The US had an incredibly low doubling rate in the beginning but also low levels of testing. It did much worse after 10 days and observations were in line with predictions only after day 35 . Poland also behaved worse in the beginning but the doubling rate dropped to the predicted rate at day 10. The time points when improvement set in were about 1.5 to 2 weeks after the workplace mobility began to drop.

Findings regarding individual countries must be evaluated in light of the their unique set of biases. Indeed, this issue does not yet have a clear solution and warrants continued attention. A feature of our analysis that is favorable is that while absolute case counts may be subject to reporting error, the trends in time-dynamics on which we focus here are more robust, in the sense that biases for a given country may affect the entire trajectory, although to a different degree over time as for example testing is ramped up.",

Meanwhile, countries which boast lower than average case fatality rates typically improve upon them even further. Demographically older countries also suffer higher case fatality rates, as expected. (FCR, Figures 6 and 9) The first three key messages highlight the importance of early responses to the exposure, particularly during the first 25 days, a period that we have reason to characterize as a priming period. For example, the UK and Greece both have average baseline levels of spread, but Greece successfully maintains a level of containment while the UK suffers increased spread of the virus. The differences in initial responses across countries with similar baselines may be the key to understanding the factors which cause a country's case load to escalate rapidly. The two patterns of growth identified here may serve as a useful jumping-off point for answering other similar lines of questioning. The importance of enacting preventative measures early is reaffirmed by our analysis, as countries who decreased social mobility before reaching high levels of spread did better than their predicted case counts and generally had less severe situations at the end of the interval.",

We include in our analysis countries with population size at least 100, 000 by 2018 that have suffered at least 5 deaths by May 18, 2020 and have been exposed to the virus for at least 67 days, which results in n = 64 countries.
