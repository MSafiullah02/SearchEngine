Although the M protein gene could be cloned into hAdVs and expressed constituvely in 293 cells under the control of the hCMV immediate early promotor/enhancer, hAdVs expressing N and GP 5 proteins, which appeared to be toxic or interfered with adenovirus replication, could only be generated by inclusion of a tetracycline-regulatable promotor in the transfer vector pAdTR5. The recombinant (rec) proteins appeared similar to the authentic viral proteins in regards to their M r s and antigenicities. However, the recGP 5 apparently possesses different Nlinked oligosaccharides residues. Its sensitivity to endo-\u03b2-galactosidase digestion indicates that poly-N-acetyllactosamine is present on the individually-expressed protein, but not on the authentic GP 5 anchored into the virion envelope. The recGP 5 apparently accumulates within the ER compartment as a glycoprotein that possesses high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharide side chains sensitive to endo-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment, by contrast to its viral counterpart for which N-linked oligosaccharide side chains are of both high-mannose and complex types.

            "text": "Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of an economically important pig disease, with a worlwide distribution, characterized by reproductive failure in sows of any parities and respiratory problems in unweaned and growing pigs [10, 16] . The virus is morphologically, structurally and genomically similar to other members of the genus Arterivirus, which also includes Equine arteritis virus (EAV), murine Lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus (LDV) and Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [10, 29, 39] . These viruses, as well as PRRSV, were recently classified in the order Nidovirales, which includes members of the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae families [4] . The viral genome consists in a positive single-stranded polyadenylated RNA molecule of approximately 15 kb in length and is composed of nine open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORF3-7) which are expressed as a nested set of sub-genomic mRNAs [29, 30, 39, 46] . Sequence analysis revealed that European and North american strains represent two distinct genotypes, with less than 55% amino acid (aa) identities for proteins encoded by ORFs 2, 4, and 5 [10] . The ORF1, representing nearly 75% of the viral genome, encodes for proteins with replicase and polymerase activities [39] . The ORFs 5 to 7 encode for the three major structural proteins of the virion: the envelope glycoprotein GP 5 (25) (26) , the non-glycosylated membrane protein M (18) (19) and the nucleocapsid protein N (14-15 kDa) [23, 24, 30] . These structural proteins are closely associated both in the infected-cells and in the virion, the association of GP 5 and M into disulfide-linked heterodimers being essential for authentic maturation and post-translational modification of GP 5 [24] , as previously demonstrated for the homologous G L and M envelope proteins of EAV [9] .",

More recently, genetic immunization of pigs with plasmidic DNA encoding the ORF5 gene not only triggered the immune system for the production of anti-PRRSV neutralizing antibodies, but also conferred protection against development of clinical disease and lung lesions following intratracheal challenge with the homologous virulent strain [34] . However, DNA immunization was apparently not sufficient to inhibit virus persistence and shedding in the respiratory tract of challenged pigs. On the other hand, when E. coli-expressed GST-ORF5 rec fusion protein was used as immunogen prior to a challenge with pathogenic virus, the disease was more severe despite the development of high titers (> 2048) of non-neutralizing antibodies to GP 5 [34] . Data obtained suggest that the immune response to unglycosylated linear epitopes of E. coli-expressed ORF5 product is not sufficient to protect pigs [34] , and that the establishment of an effective mucosal immunity against glycosylated and conformational dependent epitopes is probably crucial, particularly to control virus persistence and shedding. However, this aspect of immunity against PRRSV has not been investigated so far. Consequently, the use of viral vectors with the ability to infect pig cells of the intestinal or respiratory tract, such as adenoviral and poxviral vectors, could be preferable to produce large amounts of recGP 5 that have conserved the major characteristics of the authentic viral glycoprotein [45] .",

Both replication-defective and replication-competent hAd5 vectors (hAdV) have been used for insertion of foreign genes [17] . However, replication-defective viruses, which have been deleted for the E1 genomic region ( E1) that is known to be crucial for virus replication, are often preferred to replication-competent vectors for their biosafety. Indeed, under those conditions, the vaccinated animals are expected to be unable to shed infectious viruses that could dissiminated to unvaccinated pigs kept in the same building. Therefore, there is no risk for human of being infected by a replicative hAdV either from direct contact, meat or animal by-products. Although unable to replicate in vivo, E1 hAdVs can induce an immune response to inserted gene products after systemic or intranasal administration [12, 14, 31] . More specifically, the efficacy in swine of hAdV as recombinant vaccine carrying genes of a variety of swine pathogens was demonstrated [3, 43, 44] . The main objectives of the present study were to construct replication-defective hAdVs expressing the three major structural proteins of PRRSV in a vaccine strategy overview and to compare the adenoviral-expressed recGP 5 protein to the authentic PRRSV protein in terms of cellular processing and final maturation, antigenicity, immunogenicity and proapoptotic activity.",

Infectivity titers of hAdVs stocks were determined by calculation of plaque forming units (PFU) per ml on 293 cell monolayers [18] . AdCMV/tTA, which permits the constitutive expression of the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) under the control of the constitutive human CMV immediate-early promoter/enhancer was used in co-infection to allow expression of rec proteins in cells infected with hAdVs expressing the transgenes under the control of the TR5 promoter. Doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) (1 \u00b5g/ml) was used to inhibit expression of the transgenes in hAdV-infected cells [26] . The 293 TetOn cells (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, California, U.S.A.), that constitutively express the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA), were cultivated in the presence of 1 \u00b5g/ml of doxycycline to induce the expression of the transgenes driven by the tetracycline-regulatable promoter (TR5) [26] . BMAdE1 cells, an A549 cell line expressing AdE1 proteins from a vector designed to eliminate the generation of replication competent adenoviruses [25] , were propagated in similar conditions as 293 cells [1] . Hyperimmune rabbit monospecific antisera \u03b15, \u03b16 and \u03b17, directed respectively against GP 5 , M and N proteins of the homologous IAF-Klop PRRSV strain expressed in E. coli, were obtained from previous studies [24] .",

All primers contained two BamHI restriction sites at their 5 end, and in the case of sense primers, the ATG initiator codon was preceded by a triple GCC motif in order to provide an optimal Kozak consensus sequence for efficient translation [20] . For each reaction, the amplified product was inserted into the unique BamHI site of the pAdCMV5 or pAdTR5 transfer vectors [26] , to ensure that the transgenes would be under the control of the constitutive hCMV immediate-early promoter/enhancer (pAdCMV5) or the tetracycline-regulatable promotor (pAdTR5). The rec plasmids were rescued into the genome of Ad/CMVlacZ by homologous recombination in 293 cells, as described elsewhere [18] . Upon cotransfection, virus plaques were isolated, amplified in 293 cells, and analyzed for the expression of the rec proteins (recN, recM and recGP 5 ) either by Western blot or by radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPA). The hAdVs AdTR5/ORF5, AdCMV5/ORF6 and AdTR5/ORF7, which expressed the recombinant GP 5 , M and N proteins, respectively, were subjected to three consecutive rounds of plaque purification on BMAdE1 clone 78 cells.

            "text": "Preliminary attempts to generate replication-defective hAdVs expressing in mamalian cells the products of ORFs 5 and 7 genes of the North American IAF-Klop strain of PRRSV were unsuccessful. Apparently, high level of intracellular synthesis of the GP 5 and N proteins interfered with replication or assembly of the hAdVs. Indeed, replication-defective hAdVs could be generated by substitution of the constitutive expression cassette of the pAdCMV5 transfer vector by an inducible vector in which the tetracycline-regulatable promoter was used to control the level of transcription of the transgenes in the cells. On the other hand, hAdVs expressing constitutively the recM protein could be obtained, but viral stocks had only infectivity titers of 10 7 PFU per ml. Usually, infectivity titers of recombinant hAdV viral stocks vary between 10 8 -10 10 PFU/ml and even more following virus purification by isopycnic ultracentrifugation. RIPA experiments, in which lysates of hAdVs-infected 293 cells were incubated with specifc rabbit hyperimmune sera raised to GST-ORF5 (\u03b15), -ORF6 (\u03b16) and -ORF7 (\u03b17) rec fusion proteins of the homologous virus, permitted visualization of immunoprecipitated polypeptides co-migrating with the authentic major viral structural proteins, GP 5 , M and N ( Fig. 1 ). Data suggested that hAdV-expressed rec proteins conserved most antigenic determinants of the authentic viral structural proteins. The recGP 5 of the IAF-Klop strain was also recognized by heterologous monospecific rabbit hyperimmune serum raised toward GST-ORF5 recombinant fusion proteins generated for five other prototype PRRSV strains, either from North America or Europe, a further evidence that antigenicity of the recGP 5 was most entirely conserved [35] . As previously reported by Mardassi et al. (1996) , in RIPA experiments the three major structural proteins synthesized in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells coprecipitated ( Fig. 1 ) because of their proteinic interactions, such as the presence of disulfide bonds.",

However, reactivity profiles obtained with monospecific rabbit \u03b15 hyperimmune serum, when tested with lysates of PRRSV-infected MARC-145 and 293 cells, or infected with AdTR5/ORF5 after treatment with various endoglycosidases, suggested that the oligosaccharide residues of the recGP 5 differ from those of the authentic major envelope GP 5 glycoprotein. Consistent with previous findings [24] , the monospecific \u03b15 antiserum coprecipitated the M protein being associated with the GP 5 as disulfide-linked heterodimers in PRRSV-infected cells (Fig. 2a) . Also, the authentic GP 5 synthesized in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells appeared as a highly glycosylated protein with estimated M r of 25 kDa that was converted to a single species of 16,5 kDa (P 5 ) following treatment with Glyco F, an endoglycosidase known to cleave all N-linked oligosaccharides side chains [24] . However, it was totally resistant to Endo \u03b2 (Fig. 2a) , indicating that it lacks N-linked glycans modified by poly-N-acetyllactosamine [24] . On the other hand, treatment with Endo H (Fig. 2a) , which cleaves high-mannose and hybrid oligosaccharides [24] , demonstrated that the authentic viral GP 5 is partially sensitive to this glycosidase giving rise to at least two protein species of 16,5 kDa (P 5 ) and 21-22 kDa (named GP 5 H for sensitivity to Endo H), suggestive of the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex type. Consequently, data indicated that recGP 5 lacks N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex type since it was totally sensitive to Endo H (Fig. 2b) . The recGP 5 was rather partially sensitive to digestion with Endo \u03b2, giving rise to two protein species of 20-22 kDa (named recGP 5 \u03b2 for sensitivity to Endo \u03b2) and 25 kDa (recGP 5 ), respectively. In order to certify that differences in the glycosylation nature of recGP 5 were independent of the cell type used to propagate the hAVds, MARC-145 cells were coinfected with AdCMV5/tTA and AdTR5/ORF5. Upon individual expression in these cells, the recGP 5 appeared to be similarly glycosylated than after propagation of the hAdVs in 293 cells (Fig. 2c) .",

Sensitivity to Endo H and partial resistance to Endo \u03b2 glycosidases were maintained during the 240 min chase period (Fig. 3c,d) , suggesting that individually expressed recGP 5 in 293 cells probably accumulated in the ER, being subjected to partial modification by poly-N-acetyllactosamine. In further experiments, the transport of GP 5 in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells was shown to be blocked by the addition of BFA in the culture medium (Fig. 4) , a chemical which inhibits translocation of proteins from the ER to the Golgi compartment [19] . In the presence of this inhibitor, GP 5 synthesized in the context of a PRRSV-infection did not acquire any Endo H resistance (Fig. 4) . The results obtained indicate that during the maturation cycle of PRRSV, GP 5 first accumulated in the ER in the form of P 5 , as demonstrated with the individually expressed recGP 5 (Fig. 2b) . Neither the three major viral structural proteins (Fig. 4) , nor assembled viral particles (data not shown), could be found in the supernatant fluids of PRRSV-infected cells in the presence of BFA, contrarily to the situation observed in the absence of BFA (Fig. 4) . Therefore, through its transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, the GP 5 apparently acquires oligosaccharide side chains of the complex type, giving rise to a 21-22 kDa protein species (GP 5 H) (Fig. 4) . As previously described [24] , GP 5 H was the protein species incorporated in the mature virions.",

Interestingly, when recGP 5 was expressed individually in MARC-145 cells, cellular degenerescence was observed (Fig. 6b) . These degenerative changes were neither observed when doxycycline was added to the medium (Fig. 6b , left panel) nor in cells expressing the recN protein alone (data not shown). The cellular changes observed with recGP 5 appeared almost identical to those observed in the PRRSV-infected cell cultures [23] . Indeed, scattered and enlarged cells with very small granular inclusions in their cytoplasm usually started to be detectable by 24 h pi, then infected cells showed a tendency to clump into foci that could be well delineated from the unaffected monolayer by 36 to 48 h pi. Many of the infected cells eventually detached from the surface of the culture flask, more than 75% of the cell monolayer being severely damaged by 72 h pi. To test whether the observed cytotoxicity was due to apoptosis, cells were assayed for the presence of DNA fragmentation by a TUNEL fluorescent assay, 3 days after infection. As illustrated in Fig. 6b , positive fluorescent cells were detected only when GP 5 expression was turned on and only in areas affected by degenerative damages. DNA fragmentation was also detected in PRRSV-infected cells (Fig. 6b) . Additional evidence that apoptosis was occurring in AdTR5/ORF5infected cells was obtained by the demonstration of procaspase 3 activation. As depicted in Fig. 7 , an important increase in caspase 3 activity was detected only in cells expressing the recGP 5 . Addition of doxycycline to inhibit recGP 5 expression did repress the procaspase 3 activation which was detected at the same level than in control cell cultures which had been infected with AdCMV/tTA alone. The levels of caspase 3 specifically induced by recGP 5 , that were evaluated from three separate experiments, were at least 39 and 10 fold higher than those detected in the control uninfected cell monolayers and AdCMV/tTA infected cells, respectively. By comparison, PRRSV infection also resulted in procaspase 3 activation, but to a lower extent than AdTR5/ORF5 infection where recGP 5 was individually expressed. This was probably due to the lower number of cells expressing the GP 5 protein, since an MOI of only 0,04 TCID 50 per cell could be used for PRRSV, as compared to 50 PFU per cell for the hAdV AdTR5/ORF5.",

            "text": "In the present study, generation of replication-defective hAdVs expressing constitutively ORFs5 and 7 of a NorthAmerican strain of PRRSV under the control of the hCMV immediate-early promoter/enhancer was unsuccessful, despite that such hAdV was obtained for the ORF6. However, infectivity titers of the replicationdefective hAdV/ORF6 propagated in 293 cells, complementing the E1 functions of the hAd5, were at least 10 to 100 fold lower than those usually expected for such recombinant adenoviruses [18] . Further characterization of the authentic GP 5 of IAF-Klop strain of PRRSV demonstrates that, as the homologous protein of European strains [40] , it induces cell death by apoptosis ( Fig. 6b and 7 ) and appears to be toxic for 293 cells. Both characteristics could explain the failure to generate hAdVs that constitutively express this major envelope glycoprotein of PRRSV. Whether similar phenomena can also interfere with generation of hAdVs that constitutively express the N protein should be further investigated, as no cytotoxicity in 293 cells transfected with pAdCMV5/ORF7 could be observed (data not shown). However, previous investigators [36] identified the nucleolus of PRRSV-infected cells as the primary site for N protein localization within the nucleus and have observed some toxicity. Even if cell death did not appear to correlate with this early localization of the N protein during PRRSV replication cycle, it may interfere with some cellular functions required for the generation of hAdVs. Consequently, to generate hAdVs that could express the GP 5 and N proteins, an inducible system was required to be able to control the synthesis of both proteins to a threshold level above which they become toxic for the cells and interfere with replication and assembly of hAdVs. This was done by using the tetracycline-regulated promoter contained in the pAdTR5 transfer vector which has been already reported to permit the construction of hAdVs expressing toxic proteins [26, 27] . In MARC-145 cells, coinfection of hAdVs expressing the tTA transactivator (AdCMV/tTA) with hAdVs expressing the PRRSV structural genes under the control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter (AdTR5/ORF5 and AdTR5/ORF7) was essential to allow efficient expression of PRRSV rec proteins. Addition of doxycycline in the culture medium also completely suppressed expression of the transgenes (Fig. 6a) , thus confirming that the tetracycline-regulated expression system was very efficient for controlling the expression levels of both viral proteins, to allow generation of hAdVs carrying the ORFs 5 and 7. The antigenicity of the recN, recM and recGP 5 expressed by hAdVs (AdTR5/ ORF7, AdCMV5/ORF6 and AdTR5/ORF5) was conserved since the rec proteins could be detected by the homologous monospecific rabbit antiserum raised against the corresponding viral protein expressed in E. coli. [24] , by the homologous porcine anti-PRRSV hyperimmune serum, as well as heterologous monospecific rabbit hyperimmune sera raised toward GST-ORF5 recombinant fusion proteins of five other prototype PRRSV strains, either from North America or Europe [35] . Data also suggested that both, linear and conformational epitopes of PRRSV major structural proteins were conserved following expession by the rec hAdVs, despite that glycosylation of the recGP 5 protein was found to be different from that of the authentic GP 5 . Indeed, whereas the authentic viral GP 5 of the IAF-Klop strain was resistant to treatment with Endo \u03b2 glycosidase [24] , the individually expressed recGP 5 was partially sensitive to digestion by this endoglycosidase (Fig. 2) . Consequently, by contrast to the authentic viral GP 5 , the recGP 5 expressed individually by hAdVs possesses N-acetyllactosamine side chain oligosaccharides. Several structural features on the authentic protein (fucose, branching, galactose sulfate residues) may be responsible for its resistance to Endo \u03b2 glycosidase [37] . The presence of such oligosaccharide residues (N-acetyllactosamine side chains) have been previously reported in the case of the G L protein of EAV, the counterpart of the GP 5 of PRRSV [8] . The sensitivity of the recGP 5 protein to Endo H glycosidase is an indication that the individually expressed protein is associated with intracellular membranes or accumulates within the ER. This correlates with the fact that in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells incubated with BFA, which inhibits translocation of the proteins to the Golgi apparatus [19] , the authentic GP 5 remained sensitive to Endo H, as in case of the recGP 5 (Fig. 4) . However, even after treatment with BFA, the authentic GP 5 still differs from the recGP 5 in regards to their distinct reactivity to Endo \u03b2 digestion. Further studies are required to identify whether this difference can be attributed to interactions with proteins synthesized during the replication of hAdVs or if interactions with other unidentified PRRSV proteins are required for final maturation of GP 5 occuring in the Golgi apparatus. The glycosylation state of the GP 5 may have an important role to play in its biological activity, as previously demonstrated for LDV in mice for which the glycosylation state of the major envelope structural protein is implicated in the neuropathogenicity of the various strains, as well as inactivation by neutralizing antibodies [5] .",

Consequently, the formation of these heterodimers play a key role in the maturation and infectivity of the PRRSV virions [9, 13, 24] . However, in the present study, such heterodimers could not be demonstrated by co-infection experiments with hAdVs-expressed recGP 5 , recM and/or recN proteins (Fig. 5) , done in two different cell lines (data not shown). Also, no virionlike particles could be observed in the supernatant medium by negatively stained electron microscopy. Since such heterodimers could not be obtained after transient expression assays of the M and GP 5 proteins in 293 cells co-transfected with the corresponding recombinant transfer vectors (data not shown), it seems unlikely that the hAdVs interfered with the heterodimers formation. It is plausible that other PRRSV proteins are essential for the appropriate folding and glycosylation of the GP 5 .",

Data obtained in this study can not be generalized for arteriviruses infecting other animal species. Indeed, in previous studies, the production of VN antibodies could also be recovered in pigs, but not in mice, following genetic immunization with plasmidic DNA carrying the PRRSV ORF5 in the absence of M protein [34] . In contrast, VN antibodies to PRRSV could be recovered from the serum of mice following their immunization with E. coli.expressed ORF5 protein [33] . Similarly, in the case of EAV, the presence of VN antibodies could be demonstrated in the sera from horses and mice immunized with synthetic peptides deduced from the aa sequence of the G L protein, or with a bacterial fusion protein [6] . Consequently, the ability of the individually-expressed PRRSV GP 5 protein to induce neutralizing antibodies in pigs was not surprising. The fact that neutralizing antibodies were induced only in mice immunized with the G L /M heterodimers of EAV expressed by recombinantVEE indicates that in the context of the recombinant viral infection, the presence of the M protein is critical to the expression of neutralizing epitopes, which are apparently conformationdependent. In the case of the PRRSV recombinant GP 5 protein individually expressed by hAdVs, data obtained indicate that at least some of the epitopes involved in VN are available to the antigen presenting cells, and probably that other neutralizing conformation-dependent epitopes may require the interaction with the M protein to become available to cells involved in the immune response.",

            "text": "In the present study, it has been further demonstrated that immunization (vaccination) of pigs with adenovirus that are able to express the GP 5 of PRRSV in the absence of M protein triggers their immune system for the production of VN antibodies, which however could only be detected 10 days after they have been challenged with a low dose of the virulent homologous virus. These serological data differ significantly from those obtained following natural infection with PRRSV, since infected pigs usually do not produce VN until 3 to 4 weeks postinfection [22, 32] . However, two weeks after the first injection of the rec hAdVs, pigs had developed high specific indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) antibody titers (>160) to adenovirus structural proteins (data not shown), which may have interfere with an efficient expression of the recGP 5 and subsequently delayed the establishment of a specific immune response against the GP 5 . To demonstrate the effectiveness of PRRSV challenge, collected sera were tested for the presence of anti-PRRSV antibodies by IIF, by using a commercial ELISA (IDEXX) and by using an anti-N blocking ELISA [11] . At the day of challenge, all tested sera were negative for antibodies to PRRSV, whereas at 10 days post-challenge, all sera tested positive using those three diagnostic tests, thus confirming the seroconversion to PRRSV (data not shown). Since the latter serological tests were reported to permit detection of antibodies directed only (blocking ELISA) or mainly (IIF and IDEXX ELISA) to the N protein of PRRSV [11] , they were expected to be negative or only weakly positive before challenge, since the vaccination was against the GP 5 only. In spite of the demonstration that authentic GP 5 specific antibodies in experimentally infected pigs sera are only detected no earlier than 28 days post-infection by western blot [22] , GP 5 specific antibodies could be detected as early as 10 days post-challenge in AdTR5/ORF5 vaccinated pigs. Data obtained suggest that vaccination of pigs with adenovirus expressing recGP 5 at least presensibilized cells from the lymphoid organs and established an immune memory, which following a subsequent PRRSV infection, results in a rapid clonal expansion of memory cells to the neutralizing epitopes of the authentic viral GP 5 protein.",

Indeed, the cells had to be infected by both rec hAdVs to express the recGP 5 . Therefore, the vaccinated animals probably did not produce enough antibodies to reach the threshold required to be detected by the serological tests used in the present study. With the type of inducible vector used in this study to control the expression level of recGP 5 , the hAdV strategy was less successful than previously described DNA vaccine [34] , since in vivo co-infection of the same cells by AdCMV/tTA and AdTR5/ORF5 could not be controlled. This may explain why only a specific memory immune response was established in vaccinated pigs (Fig. 8) .",

            "text": "European, as well as North American, strains of PRRSV were reported to induce apoptosis in the infected cells both in vitro and in vivo [40] [41] [42] . The use of recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the GP 5 of the European genotype demonstrated that the major envelope glycoprotein is involved in this pathological phenomenon [40] . In the present study, the proapoptotic phenotype of the IAF-Klop GP 5 was demonstrated in cells infected with the replication-defective hAdVs using two different approaches: firstly, the demonstration of DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assays (Fig. 6) , and secondly, the demonstration of procaspase 3 activation (Fig. 7) . Despite only 53% aa identity between the GP 5 of North American and European strains [35] , both GP 5 display proapoptotic activity. Further studies should permit to identify the GP 5 region or aa residues involved and conserved amongst strains from both genotypes. Recently, it has been demonstrated, in vivo and in vitro, that apoptosis occured in PRRSV-uninfected bystander cells [38] . This phenomenon could not be demonstrated in the present study since a MOI of 50 PFU was necessary to obtain sufficient expression of the recGP 5 by the replicationdefective adenovirus vectors. Studies are in progress to further characterize the proapoptotic activity of the GP 5 of the IAF-Klop strain and determine which caspase(s) cascade(s) is activated. Previous studies with the Spanish OLOT strain of PRRSV demonstrated that the GP 5 -induced apoptotic activity could not be prevented by using a cell line permanently expressing the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene, suggesting the use of an alternative and/or unknown apoptotic pathway [40] .",

Cellular changes associated with intracellular synthesis of the recGP 5 were visualized at 70 h pi under a light microscope (Leitz, Leica Microsystems Inc., Richmond Hill, Canada). A commercial TUNEL assay (In situ cell death detection kit, fluorescein, Roche, Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) was used for the detection of DNA fragmentation in PRRSV and hAdVs-infected cells. Apoptosis was also assessed by detecting the activation of procaspase 3. At 72 h pi, MARC-145 cells that have been coinfected with AdTR5/ORF5 and AdCMV/tTA or infected with IAF-Klop virus (MOI: 0.04 TCID 50 /cell) were disrupted in a lysis solution from the ApoAlert Caspase \u00ae Fluorescent Assay Kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, California, U.S.A.).
