They are a huge family of viruses that affect neurological, gastrointestinal, hepatic and respiratory systems and can be grown among humans, bats, mice, livestock, birds, and others [[1], [2], [3]]. In the Coronaviridae family, a well-known type of virus called SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) distributed from animal to animal and humans [4]. Another type of coronavirus, called MERS coronavirus (MERS -CoV), significantly distributed from human to human in 2012 [4]. In 2019 many cases in China with respiratory diseases were reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), with evidence that these cases originated from a seafood market in Wuhan [5]. In 2019 a new type of virus called COVID-19 (novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV), belonging to the Betacoronavirus genera of Coronaviridae family, spread from Wuhan in China [6].",

In China, the number of unreported COVID-19 cases has been mathematically estimated in Refs. [9]. Also based on the information of some Japanese passengers in Wuhan [10], estimated the rate of the infection for COVID-19 in Wuhan. The results indicated a rate of 9.5% for infection and a rate from 0.3% to 0.6%, for death. Based on mathematical modelling in Ref. [11], the transmission risk of COVID-19 is on average about 6.47 persons and predicted the time that the peak of COVID-19 will be reached. Estimation of a sustained human-to-human transmission equal to 0.4 for COVID-19 using the information of 47 patients has been done in Ref. [12]. In Ref. [13], based on two scenarios, found that the risk of death is 5.1% and 8.4%.",

For further modelling and forecasting of the spread of several viruses such as the hepatitis A virus, Ebola, SARS, influenza A and MERS, refer to Refs. [15,21]. To have a suitable plan for COVID-19, forecasting the future confirmed cases are critical. An optimization method, named FPASSA-ANFIS, has been proposed by Ref. [22] to model the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and to predict its future values using collected data in China. Forecasting various data about COVID-19, by mathematical and statistical models, is very important to a program of cutting the transmission chain of diseases; see, e.g., Ref. [[23], [24], [25]].",

Although the spread of COVID-19 has many dangers, fortunately reports show that the total number of COVID-19 recovered cases has also increased. Increasing the number of recovered cases, along with reducing or stabilizing the number of confirmed cases is important to control the spread of the COVID-19 and leads to stability of the rate of infections in the world. So modelling and forecasting the numbers of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases has an important role to plan the control of the spread of the COVID-19 in the world. Cumulative numbers of the confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases, which are reported daily by the proposed organizations, on each day depend on their values on the past days. So using autoregressive time series model can be a useful tool to model, analyze and forecast the confirmed and recovered cases of COVID-19. The SIR epidemic modelling can be done at local (country) level but the autoregressive model can be good to look at overall patterns. The autoregressive time series model is a flexible tool to model dependent data and has been used to estimate and forecast many real practical problems, see Refs. [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]]. In fact, the autoregressive model, determines the probabilistic behavior of the current values Xt based on a linear combination of past values {Xt\u22121,Xt\u22122,Xt\u22123,\u2026}, in the form of:(1)Xt=\u03c61Xt\u22121+\u2026+\u03c6pXt\u2212p+Zt;t=0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026,where the error terms {Zt} are generally assumed to be uncorrelated and identically probabilistically distributed random variables from a distribution, and denoted by {Xt}\u223cAR(p).

The various members of the proposed autoregressive models were fitted initially to the historical numbers of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world. Then, the autoregressive time series that has the best fit to each of the dataset is selected. Finally, the selected models are used to predict the number of confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world from 21-Apr-2020 up to 30-Apr-2020, and we measure the differences between the real and predicted values to show the performance of the models. Therefore, the main contribution points of the current study are as follows: an improved autoregressive time series model based on the TP\u2013SMN distributions, and a new efficient predictive model applied to predict and estimate the confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world using past and current data.

The number of confirmed cases has increased daily in different countries, especially in U.S.A, Italy, Spain, Iran, China and others. The spread of COVID-19 has many dangers and needs strict special plans and policies. Therefore, to consider plans and policies, predicting and forecasting the future confirmed and recoveries cases are critical. The autoregressive time series models are a useful tool to model data over time. However, some of the standard time series models are based on the assumption that the error term or residuals are symmetric (Gaussian). There exist many situations in the real world that the assumption of symmetric distribution of the error terms is not satisfactory. In our methodology, we considered autoregressive time series models based on the two\u2013piece scale mixture normal (TP\u2013SMN) distributions. The results indicated that the proposed method performed well in forecasting confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases in the world. Using model selection criteria, the proposed models were also more reasonable than the standard Gaussian autoregressive time series model which is the simplest member of our proposed models. For future works, we suggest that the researchers apply cyclostationary, almost cyclostationary and simple processes [[41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]] based on the TP\u2013SMN distributions, instead of stationary processes.",
