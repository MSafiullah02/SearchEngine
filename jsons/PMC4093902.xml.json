Similar to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infection, MERS-CoV infection can result in an acute respiratory distress syndrome with multiorgan dysfunction8. The rapid identification of therapeutics for MERS-CoV is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine. A meta-analysis of data from the SARS outbreak in 20039 found that the benefit of different treatment strategies10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 was inconclusive at best9. We recently demonstrated in vitro that the antiviral effect of interferon-\u03b12b (IFN-\u03b12b) against MERS-CoV is augmented by the concomitant use of ribavirin, and when we combined the treatments, the effective concentrations were such that they could be used in the clinic6. Here we evaluate the effectiveness in vivo of combination IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin treatment, in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that can be immediately implemented in the clinic for MERS-CoV cases.",

The animals' observed breathing difficulties were supported by evidence of decreased oxygen saturation in untreated animals (2\u20135% decrease from baseline) (Fig. 1c). We observed significantly increased white blood cell counts in untreated animals 1 d after infection, but they returned to normal levels on subsequent days (Fig. 1d). We attributed the increase in white blood cells mainly to a significant increase in neutrophils (Fig. 1e). In contrast, treated animals did not show evidence of increased respiration, piloerection or decreased oxygen saturation levels, nor did they show significant changes in hematology (Fig. 1d,e). To monitor signs of pneumonia, we X-rayed the animals daily. Radiographs from treated animals remained normal 1 d after infection and showed, at most, light infiltration in a single lobe 2 or 3 d after infection in one or two of three animals, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). In contrast, untreated animals showed evidence of increasing amounts of interstitial infiltration between 1 and 3 d after infection, ranging from localized (single lobe) to diffuse severe pulmonary interstitial infiltration throughout the lungs (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2).",

With the exception of the oronasopharynx in treated animals, all respiratory tract tissues collected at necropsy were positive for MERS-CoV by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3b). Viral RNA was also absent from the tonsils, spleen and kidney of treated animals, but it was present in these tissues in two of three untreated animals. In all of the tissues analyzed, with the exception of left middle lobe lung specimens, the viral loads were lower in specimens from treated animals as compared to untreated animals (Fig. 3b). When we combined the values from all lung specimens, the mean viral load in treated animals was 0.81 log lower than in untreated animals (P = 0.0428, unpaired t-test, one tail), demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in virus replication throughout the lung (Fig. 3b, inset).",

By examining the 205 DEGs identified using a more stringent P value cutoff (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 5) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we identified many genes that were downregulated in untreated animals. Many of these were associated with hedgehog signaling (Fig. 4c), a pathway involved in respiratory morphogenesis and vascularization22,23,24,25,26,27 and potentially involved in inflammatory injury28. In treated animals, we observed upregulation of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and subsequent downregulation of genes associated with cell proliferation (Supplementary Table 5). SHH, the priming protein of the hedgehog pathway, and the associated molecule GLI family zinc finger 1 have been shown to block injurious responses in the pulmonary vasculature induced by multiple types of inflammatory and stress stimuli29,30,31,32. Consistent with the reduced inflammation, reduction in cellular infiltrates and lack of perivasculitis in the lungs of treated animals, the upregulation of SHH suggests that the hedgehog pathway may regulate the host response to protect the lung from potentially injurious inflammation.",
