Up to now, for meeting the requirements of data analysis and knowledge manipulation, all kinds of concepts which carry certain meanings have been proposed such as abstract concepts\n[37], Wille\u2019s concepts\n[42], object-oriented concepts\n[48], [49] and property-oriented concepts\n[9].",

The extent of a concept is the set of all objects or instances that the concept denotes, and the intent of a concept is the set of attributes or properties that a concept connotes [37], [42]. In order to reflect the relationship of specialization and generalization among concepts, a structure of concepts can further be built by defining a partial order on the concepts under consideration. By this means, the obtained concept structure often forms a complete lattice no matter what kinds of meanings we give to the concepts, and hence some scholars from the community of formal concept analysis\n[42] called it certain concept lattice instead. For example, different concept structures have been proposed by specifying certain meanings of the concepts in the real world such as Wille\u2019s concept lattice [42], object-oriented concept lattice [48], [49], property-oriented concept lattice [9], AFS-concept lattice\n[40], power concept lattice\n[11] and others [6], [15], [16], [20], [21]. Note that these certain concept structures or lattices establish rigorous mathematical models and provide formal semantics for data analysis in practice. In other words, meanings of real-world concrete entities can be represented and semantics of abstract subjects can be embodied by these certain concept structures. All in all, learning concepts (sometimes including their corresponding structure) has been investigated from various aspects. However, the current paper focuses on this issue from a novel aspect (i.e., a cognitive viewpoint).",

            "text": "Note that, generally speaking, learning a certain concept structure from a given dataset is computationally expensive when its size is large. The reason is that the number of concepts in the structure will increase exponentially in the worst case. Considering that granular computing gives rise to processing that is less time demanding than the one required when dealing with detailed numeric processing [2], [3], [4]. Information granule, the basic notion in the theory of granular computing which can broadly be viewed as a collection of information granules and the area of intelligent computing revolving around them [26], was introduced into Wille\u2019s concept lattice as an attempt to decrease computation time [43]. In a general sense, by information granule, one regards a collection of elements drawn together by their closeness (resemblance, proximity, functionality, etc.) articulated in terms of some useful spatial, temporal, or functional relationships [52], [53]. In fact, information granules are intuitively appealing constructs, which play a pivotal role in human cognitive and decision-making activities [24]. It is also worth stressing that information granules permeate almost all human endeavors [2], [3], [4], [5], [24], [25], [27], [53], [54]. For example, information granules have been studied in rough set theory\n[17], [23], [29], [30], [35], [44], [46], [47] extensively which is considered as one of the approaches of granular computing, and applied in formal concept analysis\n[10], evidence analysis\n[33], etc. Recently, studies on combination of granular computing with formal concept analysis have been made by several researchers [7], [12], [19], [31], [41], [43], [45], [56]. And what is particularly worth mentioning is that information granules in formal concept analysis mean granular concepts [43] which are the basic concepts used to deduce others. As a matter of fact, in order to improve efficiency sharply, learning concept structure indeed needs the idea of granular computing no matter how we specify the certain meanings of the concepts in the real world, no exception to cognitive concepts to be discussed in the current paper.",

In the meanwhile, axiomatic methods are also needed in terms of learning methodologies in which concepts are learned by establishing axiomatic systems (i.e., sets of axioms). To the best of our knowledge, axiomatic systems of concept learning were often called concept systems instead. In recent years, there have been several concept systems proposed for certain concept learning such as cognitive system\n[45], concept granular computing system\n[31], generalized concept system\n[19] and generalized dual concept system\n[18]. At the same time, it should be pointed out that these concept systems can also be used to learn the certain concepts which were obtained by using the constructive methods in [9], [11], [16], [40], [42], [48], [49]. Compared with constructive methods, axiomatic methods try to look beyond appearance for the essence of concept learning. However, the existing concept systems cannot integrate past experiences into itself. In other words, they are not able to deal with e.g., dynamic data and thereby are lack of flexibility for data analysis in practice. Besides, no explanation was provided to the background of the axioms of the existing concept systems, which means that they are too abstract to be understood. But, as far as we know, it is possible to solve these problems to some extent by means of concept learning based on cognitive computing because this kind of computing approach has the characteristic of integrating past experiences into itself and the background of simulating intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention and learning.",

Our current study mainly focuses on this issue. More precisely, the problems to be discussed are analysis of cognitive mechanism of forming concepts, integration of granular computing into cognitive concept structure, establishment of cognitive computing system, and implementation of cognitive processes. Note that the proposed cognitive computing system not only can integrate past experiences into itself by recursive thinking, but also is easy to be understood because cognitive mechanism of forming concepts is analyzed in advance based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology.",

In Section 2, cognitive mechanism of forming concepts is analyzed based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology, including how to define concept-forming cognitive operators, construct cognitive concepts and induce their hierarchical structure. In Section 3, granular computing is integrated into the induced cognitive concept structure. In Section 4, we put forward a cognitive computing system in which the notions of a cognitive computing state, an object-oriented cognitive computing state and an attribute-oriented cognitive computing state are proposed. In Section 5, we investigate the cognitive processes whose aims are to deal with the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets.

For instance, in Example 1, the total number of Xi\u21a6L(Xi) (Xi\u2286U) in L and Bj\u21a6H(Bj) (Bj\u2286A) in H is 2|U|+2|A|, which is exponential with respect to the cardinalities |U| and |A|.

As time goes by, there will appear more patients from whom additional symptoms (e.g., Diarrhea, Muscle aches, Nausea and vomiting) will be observed (see Example 4 for details). So, it is necessary to update the granular concepts obtained in Example 3.",

Moreover, considering that recursive approach can be applied here, it is sufficient to solve the subproblem of determining GLiHi with GLi-1Hi-1,L\u0394Ui-1,H\u0394Ui-1,L\u0394Ai-1 and H\u0394Ai-1. In other words, we only need to discuss cognitive computing state SLiHi=(GLi-1Hi-1,L\u0394Ui-1,H\u0394Ui-1,L\u0394Ai-1,H\u0394Ai-1). To achieve this task, we continue to propose the notions of an object-oriented cognitive computing state and an attribute-oriented cognitive computing state.Definition 7Let Ui-1,Ui be object sets of {Ut}\u2191,Ai-1 be an attribute set, \u0394Ui-1=Ui-Ui-1 and (i) Li-1:2Ui-1\u21922Ai-1, Hi-1:2Ai-1\u21922Ui-1, (ii) L\u0394Ui-1:2\u0394Ui-1\u21922Ai-1, H\u0394Ui-1:2Ai-1\u21922\u0394Ui-1, (iii) L0:2Ui\u21922Ai-1, H0:2Ai-1\u21922Ui be three pairs of cognitive operators.

To sum up, it follows (H0L0(x),L0(x))=(Hi-1Li-1(x)\u222aH\u0394Ui-1Li-1(x),Li-1(x)). In a similar manner, if x\u2208\u0394Ui-1, we can prove (H0L0(x),L0(x))=(Hi-1L\u0394Ui-1(x)\u222aH\u0394Ui-1L\u0394Ui-1(x),L\u0394Ui-1(x)).(ii) By Definition 5, for any a\u2208Ai-1, we have H0(a)=Hi-1(a)\u222aH\u0394Ui-1(a). Furthermore, based on Eqs.

(35), we have\nApr_(B1)=\u22c2(X,B)\u2208GL2H2#,B1\u2286BB={a,c,e}\u2229A2={a,c,e},Apr\u203e(B1)=L2H2\u22c3(X,B)\u2208GL2H2\u2217,B\u2286B1B=L2H2(\u2205\u222a{a})={a},Apr_(B2)=\u22c2(X,B)\u2208GL2H2#,B2\u2286BB={c,e}\u2229{a,c,e}\u2229A2={c,e},Apr\u203e(B2)=L2H2\u22c3(X,B)\u2208GL2H2\u2217,B\u2286B2B=L2H2({c}\u222a{c,e})={c,e}.Thus, we learn two approximate cognitive concepts ({5},{a,c,e}) and ({1,4,5,7},{a}) from B1 with \u03b2(B1)=57. Then we know that there do not exist some patients as a whole suffering and only suffering from fever and diarrhea, but patient 5 suffers from fever, headache and diarrhea, and patients 1, 4, 5, 7 as a whole suffer from fever. Moreover, we learn an exact cognitive concept ({5,9},{c,e}) from B2 with \u03b2(B2)=1, which means that patients 5 and 9 as a whole suffer and only suffer from headache and diarrhea.",

            "text": "For a pair (X0,B0) of object and attribute sets, concept learning is quite different from that of an object set X0 or attribute set B0. More precisely, for a given object set X0, we can consider it as (X0,Ln(X0)) in which Ln(X0) is an intent induced by X0. Similarly, for a given attribute set B0, we can consider it as (Hn(B0),B0) in which Hn(B0) is an extent induced by B0. However, for a given pair (X0,B0), it is not known whether B0 is an intent associated to X0, or X0 is an extent associated to B0. Even sometimes, X0 and B0 are less associated with each other with respect to the extent-intent relationship, which means that in this case it may not be reasonable to learn cognitive concept(s) from the pair (X0,B0). Motivated by this problem, we put forward the notion of a concept-inducible pair of object and attribute sets.Definition 9Let B_(Un,An,Ln,Hn) be the cognitive concept lattice of the cognitive operators Ln and Hn, and GLnHn be the corresponding granular concepts. For any X0\u2286Un and B0\u2286An, if Apr_(X0)\u2286Hn(B0)\u2286Apr\u203e(X0) and Apr\u203e(B0)\u2286Ln(X0)\u2286Apr_(B0), then (X0,B0) is said to be concept-inducible; otherwise, it is said to be concept-uninducible.\nExample 7Continued with Example 4, Example 5, Example 6, it can be known from Definition 9 that the pair ({3,4,5},{a,e}) is concept-uninducible since Apr_({3,4,5})\u2286Hn({a,e})\u2286Apr\u203e({3,4,5}) does not hold due to Apr_({3,4,5})={4,5}, Hn({a,e})={5} and Apr\u203e({3,4,5})={3,4,5,9}.In what follows, we only focus on concept-inducible pairs for concept learning since concept-uninducible ones mean that the object set X0 and the attribute set B0 are less associated with each other with respect to the extent-intent relationship.\nProposition 12\nLet\nB_(Un,An,Ln,Hn)\nbe the cognitive concept lattice of the cognitive operators\nLn\nand\nHn\n, and\nGLnHn\nbe the corresponding granular concepts. Then, for any\nX0\u2286Un\nand\nB0\u2286An\n,\n(X0,Ln(X0))\nand\n(Hn(B0),B0)\nare concept-inducible pairs.\n\nProofFirstly, we prove that the pair (X0,Ln(X0)) is concept-inducible. On one hand, by Eq. (26), we have Apr_(X0)\u2286Hn(Ln(X0))\u2286Apr\u203e(X0). On the other hand, by Eq. (31), we obtainApr_(Ln(X0))=\u22c2(X,B)\u2208B_(Un,An,Ln,Hn),Ln(X0)\u2286BB,Apr\u203e(Ln(X0))=LnHn\u22c3(X,B)\u2208B_(Un,An,Ln,Hn),B\u2286Ln(X0)B.Note thatLnHn\u22c3(X,B)\u2208B_(Un,An,Ln,Hn),B\u2286Ln(X0)B\u2286Ln(X0)\u2286\u22c2(X,B)\u2208B_(Un,An,Ln,Hn),Ln(X0)\u2286BB.Then it follows Apr\u203e(Ln(X0))\u2286Ln(X0)\u2286Apr_(Ln(X0)). To sum up, we conclude that (X0,Ln(X0)) is concept-inducible.In a similar manner, we can prove that the pair (Hn(B0),B0) is also concept-inducible. \u25a1\n",

However, the difference is that the proposed cognitive operators are characterized by the axioms in Definition 1 which are from the principles in philosophy and cognitive psychology.\u2022Since the time complexities of Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3, Algorithm 4 are O(n(|Un|+|An|)|Un||An|),O(|Un|2+|Un||An|+|An|2), O(|Un|2+|Un||An|+|An|2) and O(|Un|2+|Un||An|+|An|2), respectively, the proposed concept learning method can be completed in polynomial time. However, the classical algorithms in [10] take exponential time in the worst case for concept learning. So, granular computing integrated into cognitive concept lattice can indeed improve the efficiency of concept learning.\n",

To be more concrete, cognitive mechanism of forming concepts has been analyzed based on the principles from philosophy and cognitive psychology. Then granular computing has been combined with the cognitive concept lattice to improve the efficiency of concept learning. What is more, we have put forward a cognitive computing system which is the initial environment to learn composite concepts and can integrate past experiences into itself for enhancing the flexibility of concept learning. In addition, cognitive processes have also been investigated to deal with the problem of learning one exact or two approximate cognitive concepts from a given object set, attribute set or pair of object and attribute sets. The obtained results in this paper may be beneficial to simulating intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention and learning, but it still needs to be further confirmed.",

For instance, (i) how to deal with the problem of learning concept(s) from a concept-uninducible pair because in this paper we are only interested in concept-inducible pair in terms of concept learning from a pair of object and attribute sets; (ii) large databases in the real world should be conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed concept learning method; (iii) motivated by the logical reasoning work [36] in rough set theory, logical reasoning should also be integrated (if possible) into the proposed concept learning method for better simulating intelligence behaviors of the brain including perception, attention and learning.",
