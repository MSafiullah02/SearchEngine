Here, we report the discovery of a novel shrew hepadnavirus. The newly discovered virus, denoted shrew hepatitis B virus (SHBV), is divergent to be considered a new species of Orthohepadnavirus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these viruses were usually most closely related to TBHBV (tent-making bat hepatitis B virus), known to be able to infect human hepatocytes, and had a similar genome structure, although SHBV fell in a more basal position in the surface protein phylogeny.

As their names imply, avihepadnaviruses have been identified in birds (e.g. ducks and parrots) while orthohepadnaviruses are associated with mammals, including human hepatitis B virus (HBV). The unassigned genus contains two hepadnavirus species found in fish -white sucker hepatitis B virus and bluegill hepatitis B virus -and a single virus associated with the Tibetan frog (Tibetan frog hepatitis B virus). Recently, highly divergent non-enveloped viruses that are the sister-group to the hepadnaviruses, denoted the nackednaviruses, were discovered in fish (Lauber et al., 2017) . Despite their diversity, all members of the mammalian genus Orthohepadnavirus contain four overlapped open reading frames (ORFs): polymerase (P), core protein (C), surface protein (S) and X protein.

Notably, the novel shrew hepadnaviruses formed a distinct clade within the orthohepadnaviruses, and grouped with TBHBV sampled from New World bats (Uroderma bilobatum) in Panama (Drexler et al., 2013) with strong bootstrap support, although separated by a long branch. Additionally, the phylogenies based on both polymerase and core genes had the same grouping as seen in the whole genome, with SHBV forming a clade with TBHBV (Fig. 3 ).

Similarly, the hepadnaviruses discovered in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum bats sampled from Henan province, China clustered with the RBHBV and HBHBV identified in bats sampled from West Africa (Nie et al., 2018) , and the ancestor of Noctilionoidea (U. bilobatum belongs) has been proposed to have an Old Word origin (Teeling et al., 2005) , again indicative of a long evolutionary history. The virus positive shrew species identified here, Anourosorex squamipes, Crocidura attenuate and Crocidura lasiura, have only been identified in the Old World (http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/ ), and although 170 Asian house shrews were captured (37.9% of all shrew samples) in this study, no virus positive samples were identified in this globally distributed shrew species.
