Recognition of viral nucleic acids by intracellular Toll-like receptors (TLRs) entails the early steps of the immune response elicited during viral infections.1 For the past 10 years, efforts have been made to define the role of TLR3 in the antiviral response and to elucidate at the molecular level the TLR3 pathway as a \u2018major sentinel\u2019 against viruses. In contrast to TLR7, which recognizes single-strand (ss) RNA (therefore its role could be restricted to certain types of RNA viruses), TLR3 has, at least in principle, the ability to play a crucial role in the antiviral response against most viruses by its ability to sense double-stranded (ds) RNA, a common intermediate of replication among many viruses.1 Intriguingly, dsRNA of non-viral origin and, in particular, endogenous mRNA and RNA released from necrotic cells have been shown to trigger the TLR3 pathway.2,3",

            "text": "Toll-like receptor 3 is broadly expressed and well conserved among vertebrates and its expression has been confirmed in immune and non-immune cells.4 A functional antiviral role of TLR3 against certain viruses has been demonstrated in various human and murine cells as well as in the mouse model (recently reviewed in ref. 5). Interestingly, TLR3 has been implicated in licensing myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) for cross-priming of CD8 T cells in the mouse, and a certain subset of human DCs that highly express TLR3 exhibit a better capacity for cross-presenting apoptotic and necrotic cell antigens after TLR3 stimulation.6 Indeed, at least in part, the strategy of using TLR3 ligands as adjuvants in vaccine therapy is based on the selective high expression of TLR3 in human CD141+ DCs and mouse CD8a+ DC subsets. In contrast to the beneficial roles of TLR3 in antiviral response and cellular immunity, emerging evidence suggests that TLR3 also mediates pathogenesis, which may or may not be directly related to the exacerbation of the antiviral response. This review provides background on the TLR3 pathway, highlights the negative regulation of TLR3 signalling by endogenous and virus-encoded proteins, and discusses emerging evidence on the detrimental contribution of TLR3 in viral pathogenesis.",

            "text": "The TLR3 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum of unstimulated cells, and upon dsRNA stimulation, it traffics to endosomes to encounter its ligand through a pH-dependent mechanism that also requires TLR3 dimerization.7 The interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein UNC-93B and TLR3 is crucial for TLR3 trafficking and signalling.8 In addition, recent structural studies have demonstrated that the length (at least 45 bp) and structure of dsRNAs play critical roles in TLR3 recognition and signalling.9 Emerging evidence suggests that TLR proteolysis by asparagine endopeptidase and cathepsins in endolysosomes may represent a general regulatory strategy for all TLRs involved in nucleic acid recognition.10 The TLR3 proteolytic processing regulates stability and endosomal localization, but its role in TLR3 function remains poorly understood.11 Furthermore, TLR3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the endosome is essential for recruiting the adaptor protein Toll\u2013interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain\u2013containing adaptor protein interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) (TRIF) to the TIR domain of TLR3. This is in contrast to other endosomal TLRs (TLR7\u20139) that do not require tyrosine phosphorylation, possibly owing to their MyD88-dependent, TRIF-independent signalling. To recruit TRIF upon recognition and dimerization, Tyr759 and Tyr858 residues in the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3 are sufficient for downstream signalling when phosphorylated.12 Two studies have reported a differential role for the tyrosine kinases c-Src13 and epidermal growth factor receptor14 in mediating TLR3 phosphorylation. These studies support the current model that after dsRNA stimulation, TLR3 binds epidermal growth factor receptor before c-Src does. Interestingly, epidermal growth factor receptor is required for Tyr858 phosphorylation, and Src is required for Tyr759 phosphorylation. In addition, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Bruton's tyrosine kinase have been implicated in TLR3 phosphorylation. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase is required for the full activation of IFN regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB),15 but its role in TLR3 signalling remains to be determined. Bruton's tyrosine kinase directly phosphorylates the Tyr759 residue of TLR3.16 In Bruton's tyrosine kinase-deficient macrophages, TLR3-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase, AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and activation of NF-\u03baB, IRF3, and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors are all defective.16",

TAG (TRAM adaptor with GOLD domain), a splice variant of TRAM, is an adaptor that negatively modulates TLR4\u2013TRAM signalling from endosomes by displacing TRIF, so inhibiting the signal transduction.32 Interestingly, integrins may play a role in the regulation of some TLRs.

De-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are proteases that specifically cleave ubiquitin linkages, negating the action of ubiquitin ligases. De-ubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) selectively cleaves the polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3, resulting in its dissociation from the downstream signalling complex and the reduction of the type I IFN response.30 Interestingly, MIP-T3 has been suggested to function in the cilia to facilitate infection with viruses that preferentially infect the apical ciliated side of the respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia by compromising innate immunity,39 although this hypothesis requires further investigation. The negative role of MIP-T3 in the production of type I IFN by inhibition of TRAF3 complex formation is unique as MIP-T3 appears to affect TRAF3 ubiquitination only slightly but is capable of preventing TRAF3 from engaging downstream transducers.39",

            "text": "A variety of negative regulators affect TRAF6, a signal transducer shared by the TRIF and MyD88 axis. TLRs other than TLR3 depend on the adaptor protein MyD88, and its activation from different sources converges in the recruitment of TRAF6. Therefore, it is not surprising to find several molecules that interact with and tightly regulate TRAF6. In addition to A20,27 TRAF6 is negatively regulated by the DUB tumour suppressor cylindromatosis, which negatively regulates the TNF receptor-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase by reversing ubiquitination of its target and possibly by a transient interaction with nuclear factor-\u03baB essential modulator.43,44 Activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 leads to production of pro-inflammatory signals as well as cylindromatosis. Therefore, it generates an autoregulatory loop that controls the immune response through TRAF6. TANK (also known as I-TRAF) has been identified as a TRAF-binding protein. The presence of TANK in unstimulated cells mediates the inhibition of TRAF6 by blocking its ubiquitination. TANK seems to negatively regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production, rather than the IFN response induced by TLR signalling.45 TRAF6 is also regulated by Pellino-3, a family of proteins that have been shown to be subject to various forms of post-translational modifications. It was demonstrated that TRIF signalling induces its expression, and through its E3 ubiquitin ligase capability, Pellino-3 inhibits TRAF6 and further activation of IRF7, resulting in down-regulation of type I IFN expression.46 A potent negative regulator of TRAF6 is the ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4), which plays an essential role in modulation of the TLR/IL-1R signalling-mediated innate immune response by cleaving ubiquitin linkages in a DUB activity-dependent manner.47 Similarly, the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner is a transcriptional co-repressor that regulates hepatic metabolic pathways and has been found to inhibit TLR signalling by regulating the polyubiquitination of TRAF6.48 The nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins serve as regulators of inflammatory signalling pathways. The mitochondrial NLRX1 protein interacts with TRAF6 and inhibits NF-\u03baB activation. Upon TLR stimulation, NLRX1 dissociates from TRAF6 to allow its function.49 NLRX1 is an important regulator of the antiviral response against RNA viruses,because it also counteracts the RIG-I-MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein) cytoplasmic pathway.49",

These data suggest that TLR3 may contribute to the intrahepatic and unbalanced pro-inflammatory response that characterizes the pathogenesis of HCV-associated liver diseases.65 Interestingly, a link has been reported between the TLR3 pathway and induction of glomerulonephritis in patients with chronic HCV infection.66 This disease is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels in the kidneys. In HCV-associated glomerulonephritis, TLR3 mRNA and protein expression are up-regulated in mesangial cells, and upon stimulation with TLR3 ligand, an increment of selected cytokines and chemokines that are characteristic of the disease is observed.66 In addition, some TLR3 polymorphisms have been associated with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure67 and hepatocellular carcinoma.68",

            "text": "The role of TLR3 has been studied in TLR3-deficient mice with various genetic backgrounds with the following neurotropic viruses: West Nile virus (WNV) (Flaviviridae, positive-sense ssRNA), poliovirus and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (Picornaviridae, positive-sense ssRNA), HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Herpesviridae, dsDNA) and T3 reovirus (Reoviridae, segmented dsRNA). The CNS is separated from the rest of the body by the blood\u2013brain barrier; the cerebrospinal fluid is also separated from the periphery by the blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the choroid-plexus epithelium.75 This structure makes the brain an immune-privileged tissue where, during viral infection, the tight balance between a controlled antiviral response and excessive immune activation determines the pathological outcome.75 West Nile virus infection induces encephalitis in humans and mice.76 The role of TLR3 in WNV encephalitis remains controversial, and both protective and pathogenic roles have been reported in the mouse model. Perhaps these conflicting data reflect the use of different routes of virus inoculation and strains. For instance, TLR3 deficiency protected mice that were infected intraperitoneally from WNV lethal infection, reduced blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, and decreased systemic TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production suggesting a detrimental role of TLR3.77 In contrast, increased mortality was observed in TLR3-deficient mice in association with elevated virus burden in neurons in the brain, suggesting that TLR3 has a protective role against WNV in the CNS.78 In addition, contrasting results on the role of pattern recognition receptors in vitro and in vivo have been reported for some viruses. For example, type I IFN production in response to poliovirus infection is mediated by MDA5 in primary cultured kidney cells in vitro.79 However, the same group found that serum IFN-\u03b1 levels, viral load in non-neural tissues, and mortality rates did not differ significantly between MDA5-deficient mice and wild-type mice. In contrast, serum IFN production was abrogated and the viral load in non-neural tissues and mortality rates were both markedly higher in TRIF-deficient and TLR3-deficient mice than in wild-type mice. These results suggest that multiple pathways are involved in the antiviral response in mice and that the TLR3\u2013TRIF-mediated signalling pathway plays an essential role in the antiviral response against poliovirus infection in the mouse model.79",

Although TLR3-deficient mice did not exhibit a global defect in innate immune responses to HSV, astrocytes were defective in HSV-induced type I IFN production.

TLR3-deficient mice showed reduced lung inflammatory responses and reduced airway responsiveness, suggesting that in the context of rhinovirus infection, binding of viral dsRNA to TLR3 initiates pro-inflammatory signalling pathways leading to airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness.85 Similarly, in the absence of TLR3, IAV-infected mice had increased survival rates even though the viral burden in lungs was elevated, and it correlated with significantly reduced pro-inflammatory mediators as well as a lower number of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar airspace, suggesting a detrimental pro-inflammatory role of TLR3 in the lungs of IAV-infected mice.86",

Mice lacking TLR3 had reduced disease morbidity and lung inflammation that correlated with reduced recruitment of leucocytes to the lung. Interestingly, mice lacking TLR3 also had lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and TNF-\u03b1 in serum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but levels of IFN-\u03b2 did not differ between genotypes of mice.89 Taken together, these results show that, in the respiratory tract, TLR3 might have a detrimental role and its stimulation leads to potential over-activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the airways that is detrimental to the host.",

These viruses induce cardiac injury or diabetes depending on the virus strain, and are considered a model of virus-induced autoimmune inflammation in the heart and pancreas. Lack of TLR3 leads to an impaired expression of pro-inflammatory response in the heart and the liver of mice infected with EMCV, and in the pancreas of mice infected with the EMCV variant of pancreas \u03b2-cell tropism, facilitating the increment of viral burden in these tissues.108,109 Greater cardiac damage and increased viral load in heart, serum and liver are also observed in TLR3-deficient mice compared with immunocompetent mice infected with coxsackieviruses B3 and B4.92\u201394 Remarkably, TLR3 and its adaptor TRIF may have differential roles in viral myocarditis resulting in different T helper type 2 (Th2) responses that uniquely influence the progression to chronic myocarditis. In particular, TLR3-deficient mice developed an IL-4-dominant Th2 response during acute coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis with elevated markers of alternative activation, whereas TRIF-deficient mice had elevated the Th2-associated cytokine IL-33. Although TLR3- or TRIF-deficient mice developed similarly worse acute coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis and viral replication compared with control mice, disease was significantly worse in TRIF- than in TLR3-deficient mice. This is the first report in the literature to demonstrate a differential role of TRIF and TLR3 in a mouse model of viral pathogenesis. These findings, although intriguing, suggest that TLR3 may also signal independently of TRIF under at least some circumstances. Indeed, emerging evidence demonstrates the existence of a new branch of TLR3 signalling that does not lead to gene induction but affects many cellular properties, such as cell migration, adhesion and proliferation.95 Surprisingly, for this effect of TLR3 signalling, the adaptor proteins TRIF and MyD88 were not required. The effects of the new pathway were mediated by the proto-oncoprotein c-Src, which bound to TLR3 after dsRNA stimulation of cells.95 This is the first example in the literature of TLR-mediated cellular effects of an adaptor-independent effect of any TLR.",

            "text": "Finally, the role of TLR3 in viral hepatitis using TLR3-deficient mice remains poorly understood. A caveat in the literature is that the viruses studied so far (EMCV, coxsackievirus B4, poliovirus and the phlevovirus Punta Toro virus) are not strictly hepatotropic and induce multi-organ pathogenesis. Nevertheless, mice lacking TLR3 expression developed higher viral load in the liver and increased mortality compared with their controls after intraperitoneal infections with EMCV90 and coxsackievirus B494 and intravenous infection with poliovirus.79 In contrast, TLR3-deficient mice demonstrate increased resistance to lethal infection and have reduced liver disease associated with hepatotropic Punta Toro virus infection.96 Although infectious challenge produced comparable liver and serum viral loads, mice lacking TLR3 were able to clear systemic virus at a slightly faster rate, and exhibited fewer inflammatory mediators. In particular, TLR3-deficient mice had lower levels of IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IFN-\u03b3, and RANTES than wild-type animals. Therefore, the TLR3-mediated response to Punta Toro virus infection is detrimental to disease outcome. Although IL-6 is critical to establish antiviral defence in this model, it also contributes to pathogenesis when released in excess through a TLR3-mediated mechanism.96 In addition, non-specific activation of innate immunity can drastically enhance susceptibility to immune destruction of the liver through activation of TLR3.97 Immune destruction of the liver requires first the priming of liver-specific T cells. These activated T cells then have to migrate into the target organ, where autoimmunity finally occurs. Usually, the liver does not attract liver-specific T cells because chemokines are expressed at low levels in the liver. However, pro-inflammatory signals derived from ligation of TLR3 can lead to homing of CD8+ T cells to the liver with subsequent enhancement of liver disease by a mechanism mediated by IFN-\u03b1- and TNF-\u03b1-dependent up-regulation of genes and their products, such as the chemokine CXCL9, involved in T-cell homing and migration.97 This pathogenic mechanism may explain observations suggesting that autoimmunity, including hepatitis, can be promoted by viral infections.",

However, some conclusions can be drawn. First, there are differences among type of viruses, but the role of TLR3 in viral pathogenesis does not exhibit a differential trend among ssRNA, dsRNA and DNA viruses. Second, TLR3 may exhibit differential roles that are tissue specific. In this regard, the detrimental contribution of the TLR3 pathway in autoimmune hepatitis through activation of certain cytokines and chemokines involved in T-cell migration to the liver is remarkable. However, TLR3 is protective in three and detrimental in only one of the four hepatotropic viruses tested to date in the mouse (the phlebovirus Punta Toro virus). Perhaps among these viruses, the pathogenesis of Punta Toro virus represents a better example of virus-induced hepatitis in the absence of other major organ involvement. In the CNS, TLR3 seems to be protective rather than detrimental against infection with certain viruses, and at least in the case of the flavivirus WNV, controversial results remain to be further evaluated. In contrast, studies suggest that TLR3 may have a pathogenic role in the lung at least in the context of the four respiratory viruses that have been evaluated. Third, experimental factors (e.g. route of virus inoculation and mouse strain) may affect the interpretation of the results obtained in certain studies.",

Virally infected cells generate signals that act on DCs to favour cross-priming. Upon dsRNA recognition, TLR3 induces type-I IFN secretion known to enhance cross-presentation by DCs and to mediate an antiviral immunity against a number of viral infections.98 This event ultimately results in Th1 responses and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation.98 The beneficial or detrimental role of TLR3 balancing the response towards Th1 immunity upon tissue-specific viral infections would greatly diverge depending on the ability of the cellular environment to modulate and balance it by generating a Th2 counterpart response. Moreover, a single viral pathogen conventionally defined as Th1-inducing bears a variety of ligands capable of engaging multiple TLRs that can also stimulate a Th2 response, although to a different degree. Therefore, a better understanding of the Th1/Th2 response modulation through TLR3 stimulation in virus-driven tissue-specific pathogenesis is essential. In the context of chronic RNA viral infections that result in sustained IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signalling, without viral control, the TLR3\u2013TRIF axis may play important roles in determining how the balance between antiviral and immunoregulatory pathways affect protective versus detrimental responses.",

TLR3 may exhibit protective (+) or detrimental roles (\u2212) in humans (a) and mice (b) depending on virus type. (a) A protective role of TLR3 in the central nervous system (CNS) has been suggested for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV) -induced encephalitis in humans. In contrast, TLR3 sensing of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) may contribute to neuropathogenesis in some infected individuals. Although the precise role of TLR3 in influenza infection in the lung remains unknown, children with a TLR3 polymorphism had an increased risk of pneumonia induced by the pandemic IAV/H1N1/2009 strain. Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children worldwide. Up-regulation of TLR3 expression during infancy might contribute to age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. HIV-1 induces AIDS and it can also cause several neurological disorders. Despite various studies demonstrating an antiviral role of the TLR3 pathway in cell culture, there is little evidence that TLR3 could play a major role in host defence in HIV-1-infected individuals. TLR3 expression is up-regulated in proximity to infiltrating mononuclear cells in biopsy specimens from patients with HIV-1 myopathies. The role of TLR3 in liver diseases induced by human hepatitis C (HCV) and B (HBV) viruses remains to be elucidated. Chronic over-stimulation of the TLR3 pathway may contribute to an unbalanced intrahepatic inflammatory response that is observed in chronic viral hepatitis. Some TLR3 polymorphisms have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in patients infected with HBV. (b) The role of TLR3 in the pathogenesis of various viral infections has been studied in TLR3-deficient mice. TLR3 plays a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus type 1B (RV1B), vaccinia virus (VACV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and IAV in the lung. In contrast, TLR3 plays a protective role against the infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in the CNS. However, the contribution of TLR3 to West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis remains controversial. In the liver, TLR3-deficient mice exhibit increased resistance to Punta Toro virus fatal infection, suggesting a detrimental role in phlebovirus pathogenesis. However, TLR3 mediates protection against poliovirus, coxsackievirus B (CVB3 and CVB4), and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infections in the liver, heart and pancreas of infected mice.",

            "text": "Figure 2: Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) participates in both defence and offence in host immunity to viruses. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, a common intermediate of replication among many viruses. TLR3 dimerization and Tyr phosphorylation trigger the recruitment of the adaptor protein Toll\u2013interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), and induce the activation of the transcription factors interferon (IFN) regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) through two branches. TLR3 activation leads to (i) the development of an antiviral response mediated by IRF3 activation and further type I IFN production; (ii) cell death through a Fas-associated protein with death domain /caspase-8-dependent and mitochondrion-independent pathway (RIP1/ Fas-associated protein with death domain); and (iii) the generation of a pro-inflammatory environment by the activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK), the p38 MAP kinases (p38), and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which differentially regulate many cellular functions including inflammation-mediated inflammatory processes. Despite the detrimental role of TLR3 in viral pathogenesis being poorly understood, three major mechanisms have been identified: (i) over-expression of TLR3 (only observed in some viral infections but not others); (ii) over-production of cytokines [tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12p40/p70, and IFN-\u03b3], chemokines [regulated on activation, normal T-celll expressed and secreted (RANTES), IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)], and the immune suppressive molecule programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1); (iii) dysregulation of T helper type 1 and 2 (Th1/Th2) polarization. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that lead to TLR3 hyper-responsiveness are unknown. Over-production of inflammatory mediators leads to dysregulation of leucocyte trafficking, blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and mechanisms to be identified. A detrimental role of TLR3 has been identified in mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV) and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (TMEV) (encephalitis), Punta Toro virus (PTV) (hepatitis), and in respiratory infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), vaccinia virus, influenza A virus and rhinovirus RV1B (pneumonia). In humans, TLR3 may contribute to glomerulonephritis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Finally, TLR3 hyper-responsiveness may play a detrimental role in virus-triggered autoimmunity.",
