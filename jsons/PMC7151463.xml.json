Even modest numbers of critically ill patients with COVID-19 are rapidly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Although a minor or moderate surge can be accommodated by using conventional and contingency surge strategies such as conserving, substituting, adapting, and reusing existing resources, current experiences from other countries managing COVID-19 suggest that the magnitude of the surge will substantially exceed capacity, necessitating a crisis surge response.1, 2, 3, 4 The clinical demands will exceed the ability to provide one or more crucial resources essential to deliver basic critical care, therefore necessitating decisions regarding the reallocation of resources. This potential requires preparation of a triage system to best allocate available critical care resources to meet severe surge to maximize benefit for the greatest number of people.4\n,\n5 Importantly, this triage system should only be deployed as a last resort and implemented as resources become limited and after all attempts to surge, move patients, or shift resources from regions with greater availability have been made.",

This will result in a sliding scale from crisis to contingency, and flexibility should be anticipated. The absence of a triage system, consistently applied within and between hospitals, may lead to unnecessary deaths, increased moral distress for frontline physicians, and a lack of public confidence in the fairness of scarce resource allocation. It is important to recognize that the initiation of adult triage levels does not itself imply initiation of pediatric triage (or vice versa). However, dependent on the level of impact within the pediatric system, pediatric hospitals will need to consider lower-level triage initiation at a point when adult systems have reached crisis triage, to respect the principles of utility and fairness population-wide.",

Shortages of trained staff, ventilators, or personal protective equipment (PPE) are very real threats in the current pandemic and will likely be triggers for shifting to triage and crisis standards of care if they should occur. As such, we need to have an accurate inventory of those resources, understanding that the limitations would likely be staff rather than ventilators or space; however, the ongoing experiences in New York suggest that all three may easily be in short supply. However, the early experience in Italy, which has roughly the same number of ICU beds and ventilators per capita as many other developed countries, indicates that our current critical care resources are insufficient to manage a similar outbreak.",

The triage protocol we are referring to in this case is for tertiary triage, which takes place at an acute care hospital when deciding whether or not to admit for critical care services.5 In a broad sense, patients who present for tertiary triage are going to fit into one of three categories: (1) too well to benefit from critical care, (2) too sick to benefit from critical care because of severe underlying illness or a poor likelihood of surviving their hospitalization, or (3) sick enough to benefit from critical care. The goal of triage protocols is not to exclude categories of patients based on age or underlying disease, and protocols that explicitly exclude patients based on a single criterion alone may run afoul of antidiscrimination laws in many jurisdictions. Rather, the goal of a triage protocol is to maximize the use of critical care resources for patients in the third category. These categories apply to all patients presenting with critical illness under crisis standards of care, not just those infected with SARS-CoV-2.13 Although we must recognize that patients less likely to benefit from critical care may not be provided those services and interventions under a triage system, reallocation may occur as resources and demand change.",
