These apicomplexan parasites undergo a heteroxenous life cycle that involves a hematophagous invertebrate definitive host, in which sporulated oocysts are formed and a vertebrate intermediate host in which merogony and gametogony occur. The merogonic stages occur in different tissues and organs and are the ones responsible for lesions and clinical signs in the host. The gamont stages of Hepatozoon circulate in blood cells (i.e. erythrocytes of species infecting reptiles and leucocytes of species infecting birds and mammals) of the vertebrate hosts and are ingested by the invertebrate hosts during blood feeding [3]. Usually, the vertebrate host is infected through ingestion of an arthropod definitive host containing infective oocysts [3], but additional routes of infection were described for some Hepatozoon species, such as predation of a paratenic or intermediate vertebrate host harbouring cystozoites (monozoic or dizoic cysts) in their tissues (e.g. H. americanum) [[3], [4], [5]] and transplacental transmission (e.g. H. canis; H. felis) [1,6].",

So far, three different Hepatozoon species were described in domestic cats in Europe: H. felis, H. canis and H. silvestris [1,7,8]. H. felis has been the most frequently diagnosed species in cases of feline hepatozoonosis in different countries around the world [1,[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. Interestingly, while some Hepatozoon species seem to be host-specific, H. canis, the worldwide distributed Hepatozoon species infecting domestic dogs, is also able to infect cats [3,7,15,16] and several species of wild carnivores [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]], which may represent an infection reservoir for domestic animals.",

No tick prophylaxis had been carried out during the last year. The cat had free outdoor access, but normally stayed in the surroundings of the house and it had never travelled to other countries. The owner informed that the cat had been in contact with a snake before admission, thus snake poisoning was also considered in the differential diagnosis.",

SDMA was determined using a commercially available high-throughput immunoassay (IDEXX SDMA\u00ae Test; IDEXX Laboratories Inc.) [26]. Serum levels of calcium were slightly reduced (2.1 mmol/l; reference range 2.2\u20132.9 mmol/l) and magnesium was elevated (1.3 mmol/l, reference range 0.6\u20131.1 mmol/l). Red blood cell (RBC) count, as well as further standard biochemical parameters were within normal ranges. In May Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa-stained blood smears, ovoid structures resembling Hepatozoon gamonts (11.2 \u00d7 5.1 \u03bcm, with ovoid nucleus) were observed inside neutrophil granulocytes (Fig. 1\n). To confirm the microscopic finding, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Hepatozoon spp. targeting the 18S rRNA gene [27] was performed and a positive result was obtained. Subsequently, in order to determine the Hepatozoon species, a conventional PCR using the primers H14Hepa18SFw and H14Hepa18SRv, which targets a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. was performed as previously described [8]. As a positive control, DNA extracted from the heart of a naturally infected European wild cat was used [2]. A 590 bp PCR product was amplified, subsequently purified using a commercial kit (DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 Zymo Research, Irvine, USA) and sequenced (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland) in both directions with the same primers used in the PCR. The obtained sequence was trimmed from the primers and deposited in GenBank (accession number: MK724001). BLAST analysis revealed 100% (561/561 bp) identity with GenBank sequences of Hepatozoon felis from European wild cat (Felis silvestris silvestris) from Bosnia and Herzegovina (accession Nr. KX757033.1). The sequence similarity with H. canis and H. silvestris GenBank entries was of only 97.7% and 96.3%, respectively (accession Nr. MK091088.1 and MH078194.1, respectively).",

In some prevalence studies, some or all cats with positive Hepatozoon PCR results in blood presented clinical signs that might have been associated with the infection [[10], [11], [12],14,[23], [24], [25]], while in other studies all positive cats were apparently asymptomatic [7].",

In a retrospective study from Israel, most cats with hepatozoonosis showed elevated serum levels of the muscle enzyme creatine kinase (CK) [34]. However, in the present case, CK serum levels were in normal range and only a slight decrease in calcium and increase of magnesium serum levels were observed, suggesting that no severe injury of striated muscle was present. In this case, slightly increased bilirubin and SDMA levels, with creatinine levels within normal ranges may suggest acute hepatic and renal injury. SDMA is regarded as a more reliable and sensitive indicator of renal function than creatinine, as it is not influenced by lean body mass, especially important in patients with muscle loss [35]. In cases of renal injury, SDMA shows an earlier increase in serum than creatinine, remaining at high levels also in cases of chronic kidney disease, on average with 40% reduction of glomerular filtration rate, compared with up to 75% reduction needed to increase creatinine level [35]. At control, creatinine and SMDA serum levels were in normal ranges, suggesting a recovery of the kidney function upon specific treatment.",

The cat in the present study had a tick infestation, but it was immediately treated with Fipronil (Frontline Spot On\u00ae Merial) before the diagnosis of hepatozoonosis was made, and unfortunately no ticks for species differentiation or further analyses were collected. A study from Israel showed a significant association between infection in cats and access to outdoors suggesting the possibility of transmission by an arthropod vector or by carnivorism [1]. Ticks, mites, sand flies, tsetse flies, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, reduviid bugs and leeches were shown to serve as definitive hosts of different Hepatozoon species [3,4]. H. felis DNA was detected in four Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks collected from two cats and one dog in Portugal [38]; in one Ixodes hexagonus tick from a cat in Wales (with only 90% sequence identity to available GenBank sequences) [39] and in 1.9% of 685 Ctenocephalides felis fleas collected from 185 cats in Israel [40], suggesting the possible involvement of these ectoparasites in the life cycle; however, no H. felis oocysts were detected in any arthropod vector so far. Alternative ways of transmission such as predation on an infected intermediate or paratenic host were described for H. americanum in dogs in US [5], but it is not known if this way of transmission may also occur or have any epidemiological relevance in Hepatozoon species affecting cats. Besides, transplacental transmission may represent an additional way of transmission. So far, this has been shown for H canis in dogs [6] and H. felis in cats [1].",

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no controlled studies evaluating treatment efficacy in feline hepatozoonosis apart from a few case reports [29]. Therefore, the treatment protocol used in the present case was based on some experience in dogs. Imidocarb dipropionate was frequently used to treat H. canis infection in dogs at 5\u20136 mg/kg every 14 days until gamonts were no longer observed in blood smears on 2\u20133 consecutive examinations [3], and it was often combined with doxycycline at 10 mg/Kg for 21 days [41]. Doxycycline was also used to treat H. americanum infection in dogs in combination with trimethoprim\u2013sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine [3]. However, there is no real consensus on the drugs and times required for the treatment of canine hepatozoonosis [42]. Two longitudinal studies monitored the presence of H. canis in blood and buffy coat and/or H.canis-DNA in blood and bone marrow after treatment with either imidocarb alone; imidocarb combined with doxycycline, and toltrazuril/emodepside combined with clindamycin, and showed that these treatments did frequently not lead to a complete parasite elimination [41,42]. Nevertheless, our microscopic and PCR findings indicated that the combined treatment with imidocarb and doxycycline seemed to have been effective to clear the parasite from blood in the cat of the present report.",
