Universal precautions with particular attention to droplet precautions are currently recommended for the care of patients infected with human influenza. Because of the uncertainty as to which modes avian influenza may first transmit between humans, additional precautions for health care workers involved in the care of patients with documented or suspected avian influenza should be instituted [18]. Health care workers should also be alert to: \u201cpatients with a history of travel within 10 days to a country with avian influenza activity and are hospitalized with a severe febrile respiratory illness, or are otherwise under evaluation for avian influenza, should be managed using isolation precautions identical to those recommended for patients with known Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.\u201d [18] Specific guidelines for precautions are outlined in\nBox 1.Box 1Precautions for health care workers engaged in the care of persons suspected to be infected with avian influenza (H1N5)\nStandard precautions1.Engage in hand hygiene before and after all patient contact or contact with items potentially contaminated with respiratory secretions [18]\n\nContact precautions2.Use gloves and gown for all direct patient contact3.Use dedicated equipment such as stethoscopes, disposable blood pressure cuffs, disposable thermometers, and so forth [18]\n\nEye protection (ie, goggles or face shields)4.Wear when within 3 feet of the patient [18]\n\nAirborne precautions5.Place the patient in an airborne isolation room. Such rooms should have monitored negative air pressure in relation to corridor, with 6 to 12 air changes per hour and exhaust air directly outside or have recirculated air filtered by a high-efficiency particulate air filter; if an airborne isolation room is unavailable, contact the health care facility engineer to assist or use portable high-efficiency particulate air filters to augment the number of ACH [18]\n6.Use a fit-tested respirator, at least as protective as a National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health-approved N-95 filtering facepiece (ie, disposable) respirator) when entering the room [18]\n\nVisitors7.Educate and limit number of visitors\n",

An experimental vaccine for avian influenza (H5N1) was produced from a seed of a virus isolated in Vietnam. Treanor and colleagues [20] studied an experimental vaccine in detail and conclude that it is possible to generate immunity with the \u201cuse of a purified, subviron vaccine administered in two relatively high doses.\u201d The immunogenicity threshold for this study was set at an antibody titer of 1:40 or greater, which is typically thought of as seroprotective. Each of these two doses is six times the dose that is used in standard influenza immunizations. The experimental doses were found to induce immune responses in about half of the adults tested. The researchers suggest that there may be some dose-sparring approaches to enhance the efficacy of the vaccine. There have been several small studies that demonstrate the use of adjuvants such as aluminum [21], or the intradermal administration of the vaccine [22], [23], as opposed to the typical intramuscular injection of influenza vaccines. An adjuvant that has been also found effective in influenza vaccination is an oil-based compound called MF-59, a compound primarily composed of squalene [24]. Additionally, recent demonstration of an experimental vaccine shows a substantial increase in immune response when administered to subjects 16 months after the initial priming series [24].",

A study involving 15,025 health care workers from nine major health care institutions in Singapore during a 2003 SARS epidemic yields results that might have implications for predictions in the event of an influenza epidemic [27]. Although personal risk was identified by 76% of the respondents, panic can be avoided by the implementation of simple protective measures based on sound hygiene and epidemiologic principles. This study, along with a study by Bournes and Ferguson-Pare' [28] in the wake of a Toronto outbreak of SARS, focuses on principles that might ameliorate the personal affect that a comparable avian influenza outbreak might have on health care workers.",

However, we can be certain that an influenza pandemic will occur [29]. The United States is leading the scientific effort to contain the pandemic through vaccine studies and antiviral studies. The need for pandemic influenza preparedness is extensive and expensive. Planning entails increased development of antivirals and vaccines, effective surveillance systems not only for people, but in agriculture, effective communication systems, plans to continue essential services, identification of health care priorities, and thorough guidelines for care. Critical care nurses, as well as all health care professionals, need to consider where their personal and professional obligations meet and end. There should already be discussions of contingency plan of the institution in which they are employed and the community in which they live. Additionally, a personal plan for their families with regard to economics, safety, and optimizing personal health outcomes during such a crisis should be considered. As many have said, \u201cIt is not a matter of if, but rather of when.\u201d Although the pandemic might not be the avian flu, history has taught us that pandemics surface with little warning and can have devastating effects on human lives, and can over tax the already fragile health care system.",
