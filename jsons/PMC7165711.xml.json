Virion is less than 300 nm in diameter, and its self\u2010assembly is very fast, viral replication inside of the host cells may manipulate and damage the host cells, and the antiviral immune response of the host can damage tissue simultaneously. Under the effort of viral toxicity and host immunity, the host is prone to get many kinds of diseases. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause chronic infection, which can lead to liver cirrhosis and subsequently develop hepatocarcinoma, the patients with viral hepatitis serve as reservoirs of infectious virus.2 Some viruses, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), human enterovirus, Ebola virus, SARS virus, and avian influenza, can cause an outbreak of epidemic infection.3, 4, 5, 6 The typical antibiotics are not effective of antiviral infection, antigenic drift of viruses can make effective treatments ineffective,7 and treatment of viral infection is still one of challenges for humanity. Recent studies have shown that many host\u2010encoded proteins are associated with viruses: heat shock protein 70 is incorporated into the virions of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101)8; serine/arginine\u2010rich splicing factors (SRSFs) are related to viral replication, SRSF2 promotes anogenital tumorigenesis by maintaining the stability of E6E7 mRNAs of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16), which is the pathogen of anogenital cancer; HIV\u20101 replication is increased by SRSF1, SRSF4, and SRSF10 within the host cells9; 36 host\u2010encoded proteins are presented in influenza virions10; MVP is involved in antiviral immune response11; and the study of host\u2010encoded proteins in relation to viruses contributes to finding novel targets for antiviral drugs.",
