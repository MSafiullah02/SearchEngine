The document was mailed out to the American people in English only, thus limiting the ability to communicate the containment strategies to United States residents who are not proficient in the English language.",

The inquiry was from a 66-year-old female of Hispanic origin with multiple comorbid conditions that put her at high risk of complications due to COVID-19. Initially, a P4 bilingual fourth-year pharmacy student, worked with family and quickly translated the postcard into Spanish for immediate use. Upon reflection, it was believed that many others who speak any of myriad languages could benefit from a broader scale intervention. The student chapter and their advisor began seeking support to translate the \"Coronavirus Guidelines for America\" handout into Spanish, as an easy-to-read document readily made available to the public. Following the initial Spanish translation, students reached out to colleagues of different cultural backgrounds who mentioned they did not recall their family receiving a postcard. Many of the students mentioned that the postcard was likely discarded by a family member who was unable to understand the importance of such a document. Language can be a barrier to accessing relevant and high quality health information and delivering appropriate health care \u2013 an unmet need that is amplified on a global scale.5\n",

This involved reaching out to Touro University California (TUC) network of faculty, students, alumni, family, and friends to translate the initiative into as many languages as possible, focusing first on those languages most commonly spoken in the Northern California Bay Area. Within a day, the multicultural committee was able to assemble volunteers to translate into three commonly spoken languages: Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. The project was expanded when the volunteer recruitment announcement mentioned that any language other than English spoken by parents and/or grandparents in any home without exclusion would also be welcomed. Within four days of initiating the project, the NHPA TUC-COP students were able to secure translations of the \u201cCoronavirus Guidelines for America\u201d in 22 additional languages. The translated languages include: Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Dutch, Farsi, French, Georgian, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Nepali, Portuguese, Punjabi, and Russian. The translations were reviewed and approved by Touro University California College of Pharmacy faculty, family members, and members of the community.",

Messages were accompanied by a video that displays the 23 languages present in the document along with a message of hope from the Campus Rabbi.6 TUC-COP faculty further disseminated the \u201cCoronavirus Guidelines for America in 23 languages\u201d document using their own social networks, including representatives in both the state and federal legislature, Solano and Contra Costa County Health Departments, California Society of Health System Pharmacists (CSHP) Coronavirus resource website, personal Facebook pages, and several other websites, as well as all of Touro University California College of Pharmacy alumni via email to use in their respective practices. THE NHPA TUC-COP was approached within hours by the Touro University California Office of Advancement to include the document as part of the COVID-19 Campus Information website (http://tu.edu/emergency/covid-resources.html).7 Within one day, the postings on the NHPA TUC-COP Facebook group had reached 1127 people, has had 149 engagements, and has been shared 17 times, adding to this, every effort of each NHPA TUC-COP member, family, and friends who have also downloaded and posted the document into their own Facebook pages. The Multi-Cultural Project Initiative presents an inclusive attempt to distribute important public health information in a timely manner to a diverse nation. The pharmacy students\u2019 ability to work as a team to create an inclusive approach quickly has been impressive and inspirational. Clearly the students and faculty involved demonstrated through their unified action the mission of the Touro University System, To Serve, To Lead, and To Teach. The project embodies a spirit of caring and volunteerism, along with an awareness by PharmD students of the global impact pharmacists and other professionals can make providing timely, relevant and high quality information to various populations of patients.",
