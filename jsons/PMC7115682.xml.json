They identified only two observational studies in older adults [16], [35]. Talbot et al. [16] studied three consecutive seasons (2006\u20132009), using a test-negative case-control design, and reported a pooled adjusted IVE of 61% for influenza-related hospitalizations; however, these estimates were only significant when pooled over three seasons. More recently, Castilla et al. [18] conclude that IVE for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalization in adults 60 years of age or older, during the 2010\u20132011 influenza season, is 58% to 59%.",

We consider this pre-existing protection bias in our results as debatable. First, we observed the third H1N1pdm09 wave, this repeated circulation levels exposure to H1N1pdm09 over the age range [48]. Second, age-specific H1N1pdm09 influenza-related hospitalization rates were in our population two to seven times higher in the 75 years or more age group. Third, seroepidemiology studies [48], [49], [50] have described the persistence of protective antibody titers against H1N1pmd09 only in a small fraction of subjects 80 years old or older [48], [49], [50]. Fourth, when T cell epitopes are compared between H1N1pdm09 and seasonal H1N1, 41% and 69% for CD4+ and CD8+, respectively, are conserved [51], hence a less dependent on age protection for severe episodes should be expected in those 18 years old or older [14]. Fifth, vaccine effectiveness did not differ when age was considered.",
