EV-D68-positive specimens were further screened for parainfluenza virus 1-4, coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E), and bocavirus by using 2-step real-time PCRs (oligonucleotide sequences can be provided on request).

Sequence reaction was conducted by using primers NRZ 269, NRZ 270, and NRZ 271 (5\uf0a2-CAA GCA ATG TTY GTA CCH ACT GG-3\uf0a2).",

All reactions were conducted by using an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) or LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Deutschland Holding GmbH, Gernzach, Germany), respectively. The protocol for detection of EV-D68 was adapted from that of Poelman et al. (3). This protocol uses 300 nmol/L of primer pairs EV-D68 FW (5\uf0a2-TGT TCC CAC GGT TGA AAA CAA-3\uf0a2) and EV-D68 RV (5\uf0a2-TGT CTA GCG TCT CAT GGT TTT CAC-3\uf0a2), and 150 nmol/L of probe EV-D68 (5\uf0a2-6FAM-WCC GCT ATA GTA CTT CG-MGB-3\uf0a2) in a volume of 25 \uf06dL in a 2 step real-time PCR.",

Amplification was conducted at 94\u00b0C for 5 min; followed by 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 65\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Amplified products (634 bp) were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel.For samples that had negative results, 4 \uf06dL of the external PCR sample was used for a seminested PCR, which was performed in a 50-\uf06dL reaction with 300 nmol/L of rhinovirus/enterovirus-Seq-9895-F (5\uf0a2-GGG ACC AAC TAC TTT GGG TGT CCG TGT-3\uf0a2)(7) and rhinovirus/enterovirus-Seq-9565-R, respectively. The cycling protocol was the same as that for the external PCR except that the annealing temperature was 60\u00b0C. Nested amplicons (549 bp) were visualized by using agarose gel electrophoresis.Sequencing of the VP4/VP2 region was performed for at least 20% of the rhinovirus/enterovirus-positive specimens of all age groups in the seasons 2009/2010 and 2010/2011, respectively. For the 2014 season, sequencing was performed from all specimens, identifying RV A-C and EV-D68. All EV-D68-positive samples were further subjected to amplification of the VP1 gene (online Technical Appendix",
