            "text": "Over a Century has passed since the first Nobel Prize in Medicine (1901) was awarded to Emil von Behring for \u201chis work on serum therapy \u2026 by which he opened a new road in the domain of medical science and thereby placed in the hands of the physician a victorious weapon against illness and death\u201d [1]. Serum is indeed a \u201cvictorious weapon\u201d able to neutralize pathogens through the exquisite specificity of its antibodies that seem endless in their capacity to discriminate and bind the vast structural complexities found in nature. Susumu Tonegawa\u2019s Nobel Prize (1987) recognized the elucidation of the genetic principles for the generation of this antibody diversity [2]. Application of these principles allows the derivation of the total \u201cpotential repertoire\u201d of antibodies in humans; the combinatorial multiplication of all the V, D, and J segments of the Heavy (H) chains times the combined product of the V and J segments of the kappa and lambda Light (L) chains as well as the contributions of the N and P nucleotides associated with the junctional complexity \u2013 leading to an extraordinary vast theoretical number, 1011\u20131012, that far exceeds the total number of B-cells in a person\u2019s body [34], [65]. More realistic is the \u201cavailable repertoire\u201d of variant B-cells that has been calculated to be in the order of 107 per person [9]. How many of these B-cells subtypes are actually utilized for the production of distinct antibodies probably does not exceed more than tens of thousands in a person\u2019s life time. Surprisingly, whereas pathogens come and go as they are cleared from our bodies, the antibodies generated in response to immunological insults are archived in our memory B-cells, the cells that orchestrate the continuous production of antibodies found in serum over the course of our lives. This entire utilized repertoire of antibodies in our serum, the IgOme, is a historical record of our past experiences and a reflection of our immune status at any given moment.",

The answers to these questions bear directly on the development of novel vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics and in order to meet these challenges one must be able to profile the IgOme. We need to be able to describe the IgOme in its entirety at single antibody resolution in a manner that is cost effective and expedient. One could then imagine running IgOme screens routinely in the course of personalized medical diagnosis and treatment. Obviously, the challenge is formidable \u2013 just considering the diversity of antibodies and the dynamics of their expression at any given moment and as a result to any given stimulus. Here we review a variety of technical approaches designed to profile serum antibody diversity in the quest of describing the complexity and composition of the human IgOme.",

The ultimate goal would be to rank the antibodies by relative concentration and categorize them by antigen specificity. The \u201cIndirect\u201d approach uses surrogate measures to extrapolate antibody species based on proteins or peptides they bind.

Two types of antibody phage display libraries can be constructed: \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cimmunized\u201d libraries. Both types of libraries are generated to discover details of the immune response to a given pathogen, autoimmune disease or cancer [5], [20], [21], [26], [46], [56], [86], [102]. Na\u00efve libraries generated from random donors are presumed to represent the \u201chealthy\u201d human repertoire of antibodies in general. In principle, na\u00efve libraries offer the possibility of selection of high affinity antibodies of any desired specificity without the need for selectively stimulating the immune response with a specific antigen. Using na\u00efve libraries, there has been considerable success for isolating mAbs against various pathogens, such as SARS-CoV [69], [86], WNV [37], and HBV [49]. The second class of library, the \u201cimmunized phage-displayed antibody library\u201d is constructed from the mRNA from a donor who was exposed to infection/vaccination with a defined antigen, therefore his immune response has been specifically stimulated. For immunized libraries, it is generally preferable to use a donor with a high serum antibody titer for the antigen/pathogen of interest. A high serum titer is presumed to reflect relatively high levels of Ab production and therefore higher levels of specific mRNA should be obtainable for the generation of the library [17]. This approach has been successful for isolating mAbs specific for diverse pathogens, such as, H5N1 [46], [90], foot and mouth disease [31] and HIV [6], [23], [41], [64], [101], [102].",

            "text": "In the matter of HIV-1, isolation of potent neutralizing mAbs has only been successful using immunized libraries (as compared to na\u00efve libraries). These have been constructed from selected donors that have proven neutralizing activity. A case in point is the study by Burton and Barbas where an antibody library was produced from a 31-year old, HIV-1 positive, homosexual male, who had been asymptomatic for six years [5], [16]. A Fab library was constructed on the surface of filamentous phage which comprised 107 members. This library was then screened against monomeric glycosylated HIV-1 gp120IIIB from which a collection of 20 phage displayed mAbs was isolated. The most potent was mAb b12, which competes for the binding site of HIV-1 gp120 receptor (CD4) and thus prevents virus binding to its target cell. Co-crystallization of this mAb with core gp120 confirmed the epitope overlap with the CD4 binding site [105]. Moreover, these b12 studies were revealing of two major drawbacks of the phage display technology: (i) This methodology is still relatively time consuming, tedious, and somewhat inefficient. Typically in standard experiments only tens of mAbs are isolated which are specific towards the antigen against which they were screened. (ii) The natural pairing of immunoglobulin H and L chains is lost in the construction of the library, thus the vast majority of the antibodies produced are the result of random, arbitrary pairing which does not reflect the natural H:L pair of the B-cell clone that produced them. Indeed, the co-crystallization of mAb b12 shows that the L chain does not contribute to gp120 recognition at all. All the contacts are made exclusively via the H chain [105]. Thus, indicating that the L chain used is most probably not the H chain\u2019s natural partner. Generally, it has been estimated that when constructing an Ab phage display library from total H and L chain cDNAs derived from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and generating a complexity of 108 phage displayed antibodies, only 10 000 mAbs are expected to maintain their native H:L pair [40].",

            "text": "Since 2009, several new and improved techniques for isolation of human mAbs have emerged. Within a very limited period, there has been a burst of innovation that has driven the field from the isolation of a limited few to the production of hundreds of mAbs [38], [77], [79], [94], [99]. These all start from sorting of antigen-specific memory B-cells, the ability to perform single cell PCR transcript amplification, and eventual effective cloning and expression of Ig H and Ig L genes derived from individual B-cells. The success of these novel technologies is based primarily on two major developments and improvements:(i)\nThe source of mRNA \u2013 using single cell memory B-cells as the source of RNA. Of particular significance is the work of Lanzavecchia and co-workers who discovered that memory B-cells proliferate and secrete antibody in response to CpG oligonucleotides, without the need of antigenic stimulation [52], [91]. Furthermore, memory B-cells can be efficiently sorted based on the surface markers they display such as: IgG+ or IgA+, CD19+, CD27+ and lack of ABCB1 [11], [51], [52], [53], [67]. This has paved the way to what has proven to be the most effective method for selecting antigen specific mAbs from a given individual [12], [38], [61], [77], [94], [99]. A case in point is the study of Walker et al. [94] who first screened 1800 HIV infected individuals for potent serum cross neutralizing activity so to identify a particularly effective donor of memory B cells (a clade A-infected African patient, as opposed to Glanville et al. [34] who used 654 donors pooled all together). They then used a high-throughput neutralization screen of antibody-containing culture supernatants from approximately 30 000 activated memory B cells from the donor. This led to the isolation of two novel broadly cross neutralizing mAbs, PG9 and PG16.(ii)\nImproved design of primers \u2013 Broadly cross neutralizing mAbs against HIV have been discovered to contain exceptionally high levels of point mutations acquired during the course of somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation [106]. As a result, this hypervariability can interfere with the isolation of mAb transcripts. In order to overcome this problem, Scheid et al. redesigned the set of primers so that the 5\u2032 primer is set further upstream to avoid the hyper-mutated regions [79].\n",

This exercise first taught us the striking realization that despite our notion of exquisite specificity of mAbs, in reality it turns out that any given mAb most often can bind a rather larger diversity of peptides that often show no obvious homology with the linear amino acid sequence of that mAb\u2019s cognate antigen [15], [89]. This is due to the fact that antibodies bind protein surfaces that are comprised of discontinuous residues brought together through protein folding [73]. Hence the typical epitope is both conformational and discontinuous. Thus, more than often the peptides fished out of a random peptide library through specific binding are peptido-mimetics that in some fashion represent complex surfaces of the antigen recognized by the mAb.",

Moreover, antibodies are often specific for glycomoieties as is the case for the immune response to the ABO blood types [93]. Phage display peptide libraries, expressed in bacteria obviously cannot account for these post translational modifications of protein.

            "text": "In contrast to random peptide display, gene-fragment phage display libraries offer an alternative that can simplify analyses especially when one focuses on a specific antigen(s). The gene-fragment phage display library can represent a gene [29], a cDNA [19], [24], [29], [45], [85], [104] or even a total genome [47], [54] that encodes the ligand of interest. The DNA is reduced to smaller gene fragments (50\u2013400 bp), usually by DNaseI-mediated random digestion or by gene fragment synthesis [47], [66], [92]. These are cloned into the 5\u2032 terminus of the coat protein gene of the phage. The gene-fragment phage display library is then used for biopanning against polyclonal serum or specific mAbs, and has resulted in the isolation of peptides which enable one to determine the corresponding epitopes of the Abs tested. These selected peptides can also be utilized as biomarkers for various applications. Novel biomarkers, such as circulating (auto) antibody signatures, may improve diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer [19], [104], autoimmune [54], [85] and infectious-diseases [48]. For example, Chatterjee et al. utilized a cDNA phage display library to identify diagnostic markers for ovarian cancer [19]. Their 65 selected clones interacted with sera from 32 ovarian cancer patients but not with sera from 25 healthy women or 14 patients suffering from other benign or malignant gynecologic diseases. Thus, the panel of biomarkers was found efficient for detection of ovarian cancer. However, this platform has limitations as well. The abundance of fragments that are cloned are often out of reading frame, consequently the identification of the epitopes is not straightforward. For example, only 12 out of the 65 clones, selected by Chatterjee et al., could clearly be shown to correspond to linear segments of known antigens. The remaining clones were either unidentified or had weak homology with known proteins and thus were assumed to represent mimetics of more complicated conformational epitopes.",

These investigators constructed a complete human proteome in the form of tiled overlapping peptides. For the synthetic representation of the proteome, they generated phage display libraries which were made from 413 611 DNA sequences encoding 36 amino acid peptides that span 24 239 unique open reading frames. The DNA oligonucleotides were robotically synthesized and cloned using the T7 phage display system. The final library obtained, was screened against spinal fluids of patients suffering from neurologic autoimmune disease. These screens resulted in the identification of 16 autoantigen candidates of which four are considered potential diagnostic markers. The authors propose that further improvement of their methodology may be realized by construction of peptides of greater lengths which could extend the analyses to more conformational epitopes.",

Much progress has been made both in antibody isolation and molecular characterization of the antigens/peptides they bind. Further refinement of the methods described should lead, in the not too distant future, to a comprehensive portrayal of the human IgOme.",
