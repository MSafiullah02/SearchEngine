The IPCC (1999) report had been preceded by a number of assessments of the effects of subsonic aviation on the atmosphere, e.g. Wahner et al., 1995, Friedl, 1997 and Brasseur et al. (1998). Over the last 15 years or so, there has been considerable activity investigating aviation's effects on the global atmosphere in national and international research programmes, including dedicated efforts for the IPCC (1999) report. Shortly before the completion of the IPCC (1999) assessment, Boeing announced that it no longer intended to pursue development of a large supersonic aircraft, largely on grounds of economics and noise impacts. In addition, the aeronautics program at NASA was folded into the space shuttle program. The pioneering dedicated research programmes by NASA into effects from both potential future supersonic fleets and subsonic aviation were terminated.",

These programmes include: PartEmis, NEPAIR, TRADEOFF, INCA, AERO2K, METRIC, SCENIC and CRYOPLANE (see Appendix I). The bulk of the efforts of these programmes were directed at subsonic effects/technology, with the exception of SCENIC and minor components of TRADEOFF. CRYOPLANE focussed on the potential for future liquid hydrogen (LH2) powered aircraft. In addition, a number of other related European Fifth Framework Projects were initiated studying the nitrogen budget in the upper troposphere from natural sources, especially lightning (LINOX, EULINOX, TROCCINOX), which have been summarized by Schumann and Huntrieser (2007). European Commission research efforts into aviation effects have continued through the Sixth Framework Integrated Project \u2018QUANTIFY\u2019, which runs until 2009.",

            "text": "By convention, the interest in aviation's impacts on climate change and ozone depletion are thought to date back some 40 years to the late 1960s when the US and UK were developing ideas for supersonic aircraft and concerns were raised over stratospheric O3 depletion (Johnston, 1971). However, there is evidence dating back to the early 1960s of awareness that air traffic might modify climate through contrails (condensation trails) (Osmundsen, 1963). The possibility that aviation might affect tropospheric O3 and climate appears to have been first considered during the early stratospheric assessments undertaken in the US, UK and France in the early to mid 1970s (e.g. the CIAP, COMESA and COVOS programmes) with the increasing recognition that tropospheric O3 was a climate warming gas (Ramanathan and Dickinson, 1979, Wang et al., 1980, Lacis and WuebblesLogan, 1990). The earliest paper that identifies aircraft NOx increasing tropospheric O3 is not clear but early literature includes Hidalgo, 1977, Hidalgo and Crutzen, 1977 and Widhopf et al. (1977) following earlier recognition of a \u2018cross-over\u2019 from O3 production from NOx in the troposphere to O3 destruction in the stratosphere by Johnston and Quitevis (1974).",

Subsequently, much research has been focussed over the last 10 years on contrails and cirrus cloud enhancement. The IPCC (1999) report pointed out that the potential contribution from subsonic aviation for a range of 2050 scenarios could be between 3 and 7% of total radiative forcing, excluding cirrus cloud enhancement (Chapter 6; Prather et al., 1999). The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report considered aviation but only briefly: Working Group 1 (IPCC, 2007a) provided a short overview of literature on contrails and cirrus cloud enhancement (Chapter 2; Forster et al., 2007a) and Working Group 3 (IPCC, 2007b) reviewed technological mitigation potential (Chapter 5; Kahn-Ribeiro et al., 2007).",

Emissions from supersonic aircraft also have potential effects on climate, depending on a number of factors (e.g. cruise altitude) but particularly fleet size; effects on O3 depletion and climate are summarized below:\u25cfemissions of CO2 result in a positive RF (warming);\u25cfemissions of NOx result in destruction or increase of stratospheric O3 via atmospheric chemistry, depending upon altitude: above about 20 km, models always predict O3 destruction (see Section 6.3). Using chemical kinetics data from Sander et al. (2000) or more recent (Sander et al., 2003), CTMs predict a net O3 column decrease, larger than in IPCC (1999), with a global negative RF (cooling);\u25cfemissions of H2O result in a positive RF (warming): this is by far the dominant RF term for supersonic aircraft; an indirect (small) negative correction is obtained via O3 chemistry (through additional formation of HOx and consequent O3 destruction);\u25cfemissions of NOx result in the destruction of ambient methane (CH4), via atmospheric chemistry, with a negative RF (cooling) although this is negligible in the stratosphere;\u25cfemissions of sulphate particles arising from sulphur in the fuel result in negative RF (cooling): an indirect effect occurs via heterogeneous chemistry; in this case more NOx is lost towards nitric acid (HNO3) and the O3 destruction/increase is decreased in magnitude; in addition, the lower stratospheric O3 increase due to NOx emissions may change into destruction due to increasing Clx and Brx (since chlorine and bromine nitrates will decrease): the net effect on O3 is dependent upon altitude and model transport, as well as the sign of this indirect sulphate-related RF;\u25cfemissions of soot result in positive RF (warming);\u25cfthe formation of persistent linear contrails that may form (depending upon atmospheric conditions) results in both positive and negative RF effects but overall, cause a positive RF effect (warming);\u25cfthe formation of contrail-cirrus cloud from spreading contrails is considered to result in a positive RF (warming).\n",

The liquid droplets formed may freeze homogeneously and soot may act as nucleus for heterogeneous ice nucleation, and hence has an important role in the formation of contrails and perhaps even cirrus clouds. The ice nucleation properties of soot are sensitive to sulphuric acid coating (M\u00f6hler et al., 2005). Therefore, condensable gases present in a young exhaust plume are of considerable interest. Whereas contrail formation is insensitive to the particles and trace gases emitted (Schumann, 1996, Gierens, 2007a, Gierens, 2007b), the optical properties of the contrails and the resultant cirrus changes are expected to depend on particle and trace gas emissions (K\u00e4rcher et al., 2007).",

All studies, including older ones (e.g. Spicer et al., 1994) have found that HC emissions are a strong function of engine power, decreasing with increasing thrust. At ground conditions, Yelvington et al. (2007) found that HC emissions decreased with increasing ambient temperature (range approximately 11\u201330 \u00b0C). Measurements in engine exhaust have identified that HC emissions comprise a range of relatively light HCs (C2\u2013C6), including alkanes and alkenes, and formaldehyde, methanol, ethylene, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, benzene, toluene, phenol, styrene, naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes (Slemr et al., 2001, Knighton et al., 2007, Yelvington et al., 2007). The EIs for the HC species measured tend to be quite variable even for the same approximate thrust conditions, depending upon engine and ambient temperature. There seems to be some evidence for a shift of speciation with thrust condition of the engine from a predominance of light HC species at lower thrust to heavier (C4 plus) species at higher thrust (Anderson et al., 2006). Knighton et al. (2007) report a scaling of speciation with thrust but they measured mostly higher (C4 plus) HCs so that this result is not necessarily at odds with those of Anderson et al. (2006).",

Ground measurements sampling directly behind an engine show that primary NO2 (i.e. directly emitted) represents up to 80% of the total NOx emissions for a modern engine at low powers, but this fraction decreases to 7% at the highest thrust setting (Wormhoudt et al., 2007). A study of airport operations indicated values of 28\u201335% (Herndon et al., 2004) but these values are subject to uncertainties of NO to NO2 conversion in the plumes and an undefined range of operations at the airport. At cruise, a best-estimate of 0\u201315% was derived, and this value seems to be engine dependent (Schulte et al., 1997). A combustion modelling study indicated that primary NO2 may be of the order 25\u201350% for idle, and 1\u20139% for higher thrust conditions of take-off and climb out (Garcia-Naranjo and Wilson, 2005).",

Most OH formed in the combustor is consumed by self-reaction or reactions with NO etc. before reaching the engine exit (B\u00f6ckle et al., 1999). The emission index of OH has been deduced from measured HONO, HNO3, NO, and NO2 concentrations in exhaust plumes using a chemical model including plume dilution for a limited number of aircraft during the POLINAT campaigns (Schumann et al., 2000), see Table 2. The data include two cases of encounters with plumes of B747s at cruise, which were studied in detail by Tremmel et al. (1998) for which OH emission indices of 0.32\u20130.39 g kg\u22121 (fuel) which corresponds to an OH concentration at the combustor exit of 9.0\u201314.4 ppmv or 0.3\u20130.7 ppmv at the engine exit: these are similar to previous results obtained by measurements in the plume of a Concorde and ER-2 (Hanisco et al., 1997). Direct measurements of OH were made behind an engine simulator rig in the European PartEmis project (Wilson et al., 2004) using laser induced fluorescence (LIF) but yielded much lower values \u223c2 \u00d7 1010 molecules cm\u22123 (1.2 ppbv) than implied by the plume encounters. This large discrepancy may be caused by consumption of OH already between the combustor and the engine exit. This difference is important since the OH radical is indirectly involved in aerosol formation by producing gaseous H2SO4 (Gleitsmann and Zellner, 1999, Starik et al., 2004), which is an efficient aerosol precursor; and, the formation of HNO3 and HNO2 are the principle sink terms in the plume for emitted OH. Thus, estimates of the initial conversion of SO2 to H2SO4 and the initial fraction of NOz (HNO3, HNO2, PAN etc.) are dependent upon initial assumed OH emissions. This latter aspect may have implications for studies that attempt to estimate regional/global O3 production, accounting for initial conversion of NOx in the plume (e.g. Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000a, Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000b, Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2002) since ppm levels of OH were assumed.",

            "text": "The most abundant S-containing gas in aircraft exhaust is SO2 (see Table 1, Table 2). Measurements of SO2 in aircraft exhaust plumes have been found to be consistent with average fuel sulphur contents (Arnold et al., 1998, Schumann et al., 1998, Hunton et al., 2000). According to models, fuel sulphur is oxidized mainly to SO2 in the combustor (Brown et al., 1996). In the turbine, a small fraction, \u025b, of SO2 experiences further oxidation by O atoms leading to SO3 (Arnold et al., 1998). Additional SO2 oxidation via OH radicals takes place downstream of the combustor exit but mostly still upstream of the engine exit plane (Tremmel and Schumann, 1999). Via reaction with water vapour, SO3 becomes converted to gaseous H2SO4 mostly at plume ages of less than 10 ms (Reiner and Arnold, 1993). The consequences of more recent findings on the SOx kinetics has still to be evaluated (Blitz et al., 2003, Somnitz et al., 2005, Yilmaz et al., 2006, Hindiyarti et al., 2007, Rasmussen et al., 2007). Gaseous H2SO4 has a very low vapour pressure and likely represents the most important aerosol precursor. Hence, the conversion fraction of fuel sulphur to H2SO4 is an important parameter. Gaseous H2SO4 was detected in fuel combustion experiments in the laboratory and in jet engine exhaust at ground-level (Frenzel and Arnold, 1994) and during combustor testing within PartEmis (Katragkou et al., 2004). Direct measurements of H2SO4 in aircraft exhaust plumes at cruising altitudes were performed using a chemical ionisation mass spectrometry instrument (Curtius et al., 1998, Curtius et al., 2002). The various measurements yielded values of \u025b between 0.3 and 3.3 \u00b1 1.8% (Curtius et al., 2002, Schumann et al., 2002, Katragkou et al., 2004, Petzold et al., 2005a). A model of OH-induced H2SO4 formation yielded \u025b \u2248 0.4\u20130.6% (Tremmel et al., 1998). For O and OH-induced H2SO4 formation starting in the combustor of the engine, models predict \u025b values of 10% and more (Brown et al., 1996, Lukachko et al., 1998). A small fraction of the SO3 is formed in the combustor but most is formed inside the engine between the combustor and engine exit (Starik et al., 2002, Sorokin et al., 2004). The H2SO4 is formed mainly at the end and outside of the engine. A budget analysis of S-containing species in particulate matter emitted from the PartEmis combustor yielded a partitioning of 97% SO2, \u22642.7% gaseous H2SO4, and <0.3% chemisorbed at soot particle surface (Petzold et al., 2005a). Upper bounds of \u025b of about 1.8\u201310% (depending on engine and the fuel sulphur content) can be derived from a combination of these direct measurements with aerosol measurements and models (Schumann et al., 2002). Model studies show that \u025b increases with temperature and pressure at combustor exit in the engine, and is, hence, engine dependent (Starik et al., 2002).",

Details are engine dependent (Brundish et al., 2007, Dakhel et al., 2007). Larger agglomerates may grow up to sizes larger than 100 nm in diameter. Soot emissions from aircraft engines are specified by ICAO in terms of smoke number measurements, which is a filter stain reference method. Correlations between smoke number and soot mass concentration were used to estimate the mean mass emission index of black carbon by the globally aircraft fleet in 1992 to be 0.04 g kg\u22121 (Petzold and D\u00f6pelheuer, 1998, Petzold et al., 1999). More modern engines such as the CFM56-3B1 on a B737 emit much less, 0.01 g soot kg\u22121 fuel. The average black carbon (BC) emission factor decreases with altitude from about 0.08 g kg\u22121 at altitudes near take-off and landing to 0.02 g kg\u22121 at 16 km (Hendricks et al., 2004). The 2002 fleet average computed from such correlations in AERO2K results in 0.025 g kg\u22121 (Eyers et al., 2005). Of the order of 1014\u20131015 kg\u22121 soot particles are emitted depending on engine type and power setting (Petzold et al., 1999). In total, improvement of aircraft engine technology from 1960s technology to today results in a decrease of soot mass emissions by a factor of 40, see Fig. 1\n(Petzold et al., 2003).",

The split of organic and elemental carbon (EC) can be measured by thermal analysis methods (Petzold and Schr\u00f6der, 1998, Petzold et al., 2003, Petzold et al., 2005a). From the analysis of soot particles emitted from the PartEmis combustor, elemental carbon contributes 40\u201380% by mass to total carbon for an engine operating at cruise conditions. For take-off conditions, this fraction may increase up to > 90%, while for idle conditions it may be as low as 10% (Petzold and Schr\u00f6der, 1998). Hence, the OC\u2013EC split strongly depends on combustion temperature (Petzold et al., 2005a). Depending on the fuel sulphur content, these particles are coated by <5% by mass of volatile matter, mainly sulphuric acid (Petzold et al., 2003). Depending on the degree of coating, soot particles may act as ice nuclei (K\u00e4rcher et al., 2007).",

At the exit of several specific combustors, soot concentrations of 106\u2013107 cm\u22123 with modal diameters ranging from 40 to 70 nm have been measured during the CHEMICON project (Zellner, 2000). PartEmis combustor exhaust studies yielded modal diameters of 40\u201350 nm (Petzold et al., 2003). Similar values were obtained from transmission electron microscopy analyses of CFM56 engine exhaust samples (Delhaye et al., 2007). The specific surface area of the microporous soot was 75 m2 g\u22121 for combustor soot, and 64 m2 g\u22121 for a laboratory prepared kerosene soot. Different from graphitic black carbon, combustor soot particles appear to be hydrophilic before reaching water saturation and may therefore serve as nuclei for water condensation without prior activation (Chughtai et al., 1999, Popovicheva and Starik, 2007). A joint analysis of hygroscopic growth measurements (Gysel et al., 2003), chemical analysis and cloud condensation activation measurements (Hitzenberger et al., 2003) obtained during PartEmis quantifies the increase in soot particle activation to cloud condensation nuclei from pure soot acting almost like an insoluble graphitic particle towards easily activated sulphuric acid coated particles (Petzold et al., 2005a, Petzold et al., 2005b). A sulphur coating of 3% by volume of soot particles reduces the diameter required for cloud condensation nuclei activation by a factor of 2 compared with pure graphite particles. The relationship between soot particle emission index and fuel sulphur content from a number of aircraft campaigns in contrail situations is shown in Fig. 2\n.",

Contrail formation and plume age alone can influence the number of detected ultrafine volatile particles within an order of magnitude, as well. The observed particle emissions decrease non-linearly with fuel sulphur content and become independent of fuel sulphur below 100 \u03bcg g\u22121 (K\u00e4rcher et al., 2000), see Fig. 3\n. The key controlling factors for liquid particle nucleation in the exhaust as identified during combustor exhaust studies are fuel sulphur content, availability of soot surface area which acts as an additional sink for condensable gases, and the temperature drop during exhaust gas dilution and mixing (Petzold et al., 2003, Vancassel et al., 2004, Schneider et al., 2006, Vatazhin et al., 2007).",

The model assumes that the number of CIs available determines the number of volatile particles formed. The amount of sulphuric acid (depending on fuel sulphur content and the conversion efficiency, \u025b) and the amount of condensable organic matter together control the size of the particles formed. Coagulation and dilution control the time scales of particle growth. Using this model, the measured apparent emission indices can be normalized to a given plume age (3 s), emission index of low volatility hydrocarbons (20 \u03bcg g\u22121), and cut-off size of the particle counters (5 nm). Consequentially, the data are consistent with volatile particle emissions of 1.5\u20134 \u00d7 1017 kg\u22121, independent of environmental conditions, engine type, and for fuel sulphur contents ranging between 2.6 and 2700 \u03bcg g\u22121 (Schumann et al., 2002).",

Positive CIs are mostly composed of HCs, in agreement with theoretical arguments. Some of these HCs have been further identified as oxygenated HCs (Kiendler et al., 2000b). The positive and negative CIs can be very massive (exceeding 8500 atomic mass unit), even for nearly sulphur-free fuel (2 \u03bcg g\u22121) (Wilhelm et al., 2004). The fractional abundances (in the range 0.2\u20130.7) of CIs with mass numbers >8500 atomic mass unit were found to increase with fuel sulphur content and to be larger for negative CIs than for positive ones. Probably the growth of these CIs involves organic trace gases. If composed mostly of an H2SO4/H2O mixture, a CI with a mass number of 8500 would have a diameter of about 3 nm, which is comparable to the size-detection limit of present condensation nucleus particle counters. Hence, most of the smallest particles detected by such counters may actually have originated from CIs and their electrically neutral recombination products (Arnold et al., 2000).",

The emissions calculated may include NOx, CO2, SO2, particles, H2O, CO and HCs. In addition, gridded distance flown may be calculated as an input to contrail/cirrus models. Emissions of NOx, CO and HCs do not scale directly with fuel usage and specific fuel-flow correlation algorithms are applied. For NOx, the commonly used method is either the DLR-2 fuel flow method (Deidewig et al., 1996) or the Boeing Fuel Flow Method-2 (Baughcum et al., 1996). Whilst some inventories calculate CO and HCs, these have been shown to be unimportant for chemical impacts in the UT/LS, since the magnitude is so small compared with other sources (Hayman and Markiewicz, 1996).",

There are a number of reasons for this: the core data for movements for all inventories is the OAG (\u2018Official Airline Guide\u2019, www.oag.com) database of scheduled movements \u2013 non-scheduled movements need to be either estimated or calculated from \u2018real\u2019 (flight plan, radar) data. However, this is not a straightforward task, neither is the subtraction of the scheduled data from the total data. For regions where neither flight plan nor radar data are available, non-scheduled data are often estimated (Eyers et al., 2005, Kim et al., 2007). For some regions where there is significant aviation activity, e.g. Russia and China, there is anecdotal evidence that schedules are under-reported. Inventories may, or may not, include some estimation or explicit calculation of non-idealized routing, or simply use great-circle distances. The incorporation of the wide range of aircraft is often simplified, so that one aircraft may represent a number of others; for others, data may simply not be available. General aviation is usually excluded (i.e. small aircraft flying under visual flight rules). Comparative exercises are currently underway between the SAGE, FAST, AERO2K and AEM (a EUROCONTROL model) under the auspices of the activities of the International Civil Aviation Organization's Committee for Aviation Environmental Protection (ICAO-CAEP) and it is proving difficult to identify and quantify these sources of uncertainty. CAEP is attempting to provide a unified aircraft movements database (the Common Operational Database), as somewhat surprisingly, ICAO does not appear to quantify/record global aviation movements. However, even compiling the Common Operational Database is proving to be a challenge because of the sheer volume of data that need to be checked and verified.",

The only published estimation of a time-series of aviation emissions dating back to the beginning of significant aviation activities (1940) is that of Sausen and Schumann (2000), whose estimations were also used in the IPCC (1999) assessment. Sausen and Schumann (2000) used International Energy Agency (IEA) statistics of kerosene fuel sales; this was recently updated from 1995 to 2005 by Lee et al. (2009). A comparison of IEA data with \u2018bottom up\u2019 inventory methodologies reveals a discrepancy which indicates a systematic underestimation of emissions by the inventories, which is the result of a number of assumptions and systematic biases, outlined above. This underestimation has been known for some time (Schumann, 1994) but it remains difficult to reconcile all the known differences (Owen and Lee, 2005). Nonetheless, it is critical that total historical CO2 emissions are used in RF calculations, such that usage of the IEA data remains most suited to this purpose.",

The potential market for the HSCT is limited by economic and environmental considerations. The scenarios developed for HSCTs represent a technology that does not yet exist but one that might yet be developed and thus represent a quite different set of assumptions from other long-term scenarios, which only consider continued development of a subsonic fleet. For this reason, the range of emissions, fleet size, and cruise altitude covered by supersonic scenarios was larger than for subsonic aircraft. More recently, research has been initiated by a number of manufacturers to develop a supersonic business jet (SSBJ) although no prototype has yet been produced and concrete plans are scant in detail. Generally, the designs are for small aircraft, carrying between approximately 10 and 20 passengers with a possible fleet size of 250\u2013300 aircraft.",

The interaction of atmospheric transport and chemistry plays a crucial role in determining the impact of aircraft emissions. At mid-latitudes, aircraft fly in the UT/LS region, where the general circulation transports air masses predominantly downwards into the troposphere on a timescale of weeks, with a pronounced seasonal cycle. The enhanced convective activity in summer largely reduces the turnover time of species in the upper troposphere. At lower latitudes, the Hadley circulation impacts the dispersion of emitted compounds, i.e. into the lower troposphere in the subsidence region and to higher altitudes in the convergence zone. In the subsidence region, clear sky-conditions enhance photochemistry, whereas the upwelling areas are characterized by deep convective clouds, where large fractions of soluble species are washed out.",

Rogers et al. (2002a) similarly investigated the transport characteristics of inert tracers localized in various UT/LS regions among models to understand better transport related model differences. Both studies indicated a large variability amongst the models. Schoeberl and Morris (2000) applied an experimental set-up comparable to that of Danilin et al. (1998) but applied a non-diffusive Lagrangian transport scheme. They concluded that a large fraction of the disagreement among models might arise from numerical diffusion by the transport scheme. Especially, a perturbation of the stratosphere above the emission region, i.e. in the \u2018middle world\u20193\nwas not found. This finding was confirmed by Grewe et al., 2002a, Grewe et al., 2002b, who applied a Lagrangian transport scheme in a global chemistry\u2013climate model. In this modelling study, 10,000 particles in the main aircraft emission region were released and showed that the predominant transport pathway is directed downward and an impact on the middle world was only found for trajectories directed towards the tropics followed by uplift. However, transport timescales were found to be greater than those of washout, implying a negligible impact from subsonic aircraft emissions upon the stratosphere.",

In a study of sensitivities to vertical and horizontal resolutions of the ECHAM5 climate model, Roeckner et al.

The atmospheric lifetime of an emitted compound is therefore dependent upon the competing removal processes of chemical transformation and removal by wet and dry deposition. Fig. 8\nshows the lifetime of a local water vapour perturbation, which also serves as a good indicator for wet deposition. (Grewe and Stenke, 2007).",

An increase in concentrations of NOx of 30\u201340% is found in the main flight corridors (for other model results see below). The additional NOx in these regions lead to an enhancement of reaction (4). Hence, HO2 decreases in that area, whilst O3 production increases. Because of the greater insolation, the maximum O3 production is shifted towards lower latitudes. Ozone production is also shifted to lower altitudes with respect to the NOx changes, because HO2 abundance, as one factor for O3 production (eq. (3)) decreases with height between the UT/LS region and \u223c500 hPa. The shift in the HOx partitioning towards OH from reaction (4) also leads to a decrease in the O3 loss via reaction (6), which is not compensated by reaction (5). Both effects, i.e. the increase in O3 production and the decrease in O3 loss, lead to an increase of the net O3 production rate resulting in an O3 increase of approximately 3% in the Northern Hemisphere, which in turn leads to an increased O3 loss rate via reactions (6), (7). This secondary effect is visible especially in the lower atmosphere (Fig. 10).",

In the main emission regions of aircraft NOx, the chemical lifetime of O3 is of the order weeks, so that perturbations are dispersed zonally in the atmosphere. Their signal is too low compared with natural variability to be detected through measurements. However, for some circumstances, e.g. a stagnant high pressure system, the identification of air traffic induced ozone changes might be possible, since dispersion is reduced (Schlager et al., 1999). Note that the lifetime of atmospheric chemical perturbations depend on the times of the chemical modes excited by the perturbing species and not by the lifetime of that species (Prather, 1994, Prather, 1996). In this case, the NOx perturbs the CH4-like mode with a lifetime of 12 yr (Wild et al., 2001) and thus these perturbations are mixed globally.",

Stevenson et al.

Brunner et al., 2003, Brunner et al., 2005 utilized measurements from aircraft campaigns, integrated in the ETHmeg database (http://www.megdb.ethz.ch/), for a direct point-by-point (in time and space) comparison with CTM model output. For the North Atlantic, the model results (Fig. 11\n) showed an underestimation of some species, e.g. NO. The overall correlation is around 0.7. However, models performing well in comparison with a certain campaign often failed with another campaign and vice versa (Brunner et al., 2005). This implies that whilst a single model may legitimately be used to calculate impacts of this nature, an ensemble of models will give more reliable results for an assessment (such as that of IPCC, 1999, Gauss et al., 2006, Stevenson et al., 2006). Similarly, the assessment of stratospheric-resolving CCMs (Eyring et al., 2006, Waugh and Eyring, 2008) shows that there is variability in the ability of CCMs to simulate different key processes, which may have ramifications for any assessments of HSCT scenarios requiring stratospheric models.",

Clearly, the NOx frequency distribution differs, since smaller-scale NOx enhancements are not represented in coarse model distributions. However, the seasonal cycle of NOx and O3 is reproduced well by the E39/C model, with a broader distribution and the most frequent occurrence at larger mixing ratios. The most frequent NOx mixing ratios are more important for O3 production than the mean mixing ratio and those are in better agreement with the observational data.",

Similarly, an assessment of the globally integrated impact of aviation on column O3 yields similar results (Fig. 13\n). Although the simulated response in O3 ranges between 0.3 and 0.8 DU for an air traffic emission of around 0.55 Tg N yr\u22121, the variability in the response is largely reduced, when applying identical background situations, i.e. NOx emissions from biomass burning or industry as done within the projects TRADEOFF and QUANTIFY (but not during AEROCHEM II), with the exception of one model. The other model applied within TRADEOFF showed an increase of around 0.4 DU (0.33\u20130.44 DU) for an annual air traffic emission rate of 0.6 Tg N yr\u22121 and 0.6 DU (0.53\u20130.64 DU) per 0.76 Tg N yr\u22121 within QUANTIFY. The variability among these models is around 10\u201315%. Further model studies (Isaksen et al., 2001, Rodriguez et al., 2003, Grewe et al., 2002a, Grewe et al., 2002b) (including other background emissions) showed different responses ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 DU for an emission of around 0.6 Tg N yr\u22121. Whilst the O3 column change for an aircraft perturbation is reasonably consistent, it should be noted that total tropospheric O3 column change amongst models still shows large variance, Gauss et al. (2006) noting a range of 7.9\u201313.8 DU in a comparison of seven CCMs and three CTMs.",

The IPCC (Isaksen et al., 1999) showed that global O3 increases scaled almost linearly with increasing NOx emission rates (from different emission scenarios). Rogers et al. (2002b) showed this phenomenon, with some evidence of a decline in pO3 with greater emission rates. This behaviour was also in evidence, where pO3 vs. NOx emission was examined by latitude band showing that pO3 increased at a much greater rate in low background NOx environments. Grewe (2007) analysed a transient model simulation from 1960 to 1999 with increasing air traffic emissions along with changing background conditions, i.e. increasing background NOx levels. The increase in O3 relative to the air traffic emissions scaled almost linearly. However, a reduction in O3 production efficiency can be observed (Fig. 13b), when comparing model simulations for different time horizons for consistent emission values. Table 6\ngives a comparison of such model approaches (Isaksen et al., 2001, Grewe et al., 2002a, Grewe et al., 2002b, Grewe, 2007), by taking the 1990s ratio between O3 increase and air traffic NOx emissions on a relative basis (=100%) and comparing relative changes in other time periods. The results in Table 6 indicate that the O3 enhancement efficiency of air traffic emissions peaks at around 1990\u20132010 and decreases thereafter by 30% for larger air traffic emissions.",

It could shorter in other models or future simulations (Table 5), which may lead to 25% larger OPEs. However, the general picture is unchanged. Fig. 13 shows the OPE for the various model experiments. The TRADEOFF simulations show an OPE in the range of 12\u201318 molecules of O3 per emitted NO molecule. In the transient simulation from 1960 to 1999 (Grewe, 2007) a clear increase in the OPE from 11 molecules of O3 per emitted NO molecule in 1960 to around 55 molecules around 1992 was observed. Afterwards, a clear decrease occurred, i.e. each additionally emitted NO molecule produced fewer O3 molecules. The total O3 production is largely determined by the background NOx levels (Lin et al., 1988, Grooss et al., 1998, Jaegl\u00e9 et al., 2000). With respect to global mean values, Fig. 14\nshows a sketch of the relationship between NOx concentration and net O3 production with an inflexion around 1992.

Mid latitude air traffic emissions have a weak maximum in summer/autumn and a minimum in winter (Schmitt and Brunner, 1997, Eyers et al., 2005). However, the accumulation of NOx emitted by air traffic is largely reduced in summer because of intense vertical mixing (convection), which helps to explain the nature of the double peaks. Since the interaction between transport and chemistry varies amongst the models, these peaks are simulated differently. The atmospheric transport study of Rogers et al. (2002a) offers an explanation for these model differences: the model with the weakest vertical mixing for mid latitude emissions (their \u2018case T2\u2019, TOMCAT model) shows larger accumulations of NOx during summer and hence maximum air traffic induced ozone changes in October, compared with the model with the largest vertical mixing (E39/C), which shows the peak in late spring.",

Secondly, the counteracting effect of peroxyacetyl radicals (from photolysed higher oxygenated NMHC compounds) is to react with NO2 to form PAN, which can be transported over long distances in the upper troposphere until it subsides and thermally decomposes.

They investigated the effect of the inclusion of NMHC chemistry on the calculated impact of current aircraft NOx emissions on tropospheric O3 levels. In the upper troposphere they found a decrease of NOx owing to the formation of PAN and consequently an increase in HO2 of 20%, which leads to a lower background O3 formation since less NO2 is produced via reaction (4). Globally, they concluded that when NMHC chemistry was included in their model chemistry, the aircraft-induced O3 perturbations were greater by \u223c12% in summer and the aircraft-induced O3 production efficiency per NOx molecule increased by \u223c20% compared with a simulation without higher hydrocarbon chemistry.

Direct particle emissions are estimated to account for 4\u201315% of the overall aircraft emitted sulphur (Curtius et al., 1998, Fahey et al., 1995). However, in these older studies much larger values of \u025b were estimated than are believed to be correct from more recent measurements and modelling studies (see Section 3.2). These direct particle emissions do not significantly change aerosol mass and extinction but may substantially increase surface area density (SAD) in the Northern Hemisphere UTLS. Release of gas phase SO2, on the other hand, may increase the net production of H2SO4, thus enhancing the sulphate mass in the accumulation mode and consequently, the direct RF. It also may increase the gas phase contribution to SAD, in the range of 25% of the change produced by direct plume particle emission (Pitari et al., 2002b, Weisenstein et al., 1998).",

Both models showed O3 increases from air traffic NOx emissions when gas phase chemistry and background heterogeneous chemistry were considered only. The inclusion of heterogeneous reactions on aircraft-induced aerosols led to O3 losses in the lowermost stratosphere of about \u22124 to \u22126 ppbv, as an annual average at approximately 14 km altitude and poleward of about 50 \u00b0N, and to a reduction of the upper tropospheric O3 increase (by about 2 ppbv). Pitari et al. (2002b) concluded that the lower stratosphere O3 losses were caused by a decrease in NOx via heterogenous reactions on aircraft perturbed SAD, followed by an increase in Br and Cl radicals, increasing O3 destruction. The reduced O3 levels were then transported downwards compensating to some extent the O3 increase from aircraft NOx emissions.",

Reichardt et al. (1996) noted low O3 levels associated with mid-latitude tropospheric ice clouds. Peterson and Honrath (2001) made measurements of destruction of O3 in snowpack interstitial air and suggested that this might be in operation in cirrus clouds. However, the general impact of these reactions on background O3 can serve as an indicator as to how important these reactions may be. This was estimated by Von Kuhlmann and Lawrence (2006), who applied the CTM MATCH. They estimated a maximum O3 reduction of 4% and 7% in the tropical upper troposphere in a case in which Langmuir theory was applied and a maximum HNO3 uptake scenario (extreme case), respectively. However, in the region where maximum air traffic O3 changes occur, those values were reduced to 3\u20135% O3 reduction, implying that the impact of heterogeneous reactions on ice particles is likely to be of minor importance to air traffic O3 changes. However, this depends critically on the distribution and abundance of cirrus clouds and this should be examined more carefully.",

Air traffic emissions are therefore treated as being instantaneously dispersed in a grid cell in global models. However, in reality, emitted species are confined in the plume and the composition may evolve differently. In order to account for this difference two approaches have been taken. Box or Gaussian plume models have been used to calculate either effective emissions indices (e.g. Karol et al., 1997, Petry et al., 1998) or emission conversion factors (Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000a, Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000b, Meijer, 2001, Plumb et al., 2003). In the first approach, factors are applied to the emission inventory to mimic concentration changes that occur resulting from the difference between a simulation with a plume model and one with instantaneous mixing. In the second approach, all relevant species (not only emitted once) experience changes which depend on the emission strength, atmospheric conditions (e.g. stability, shear, temperature, time of day etc.). These changes are pre-calculated as in the first approach with Gaussian plume models.",

Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000a, Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000b estimated a decrease in the O3 perturbation of 15\u201318% locally. Globally integrated (e.g. as in Fig. 13a), this leads to an O3 decrease of around 10%, whereas in a similar approach, Plumb et al. (2003) found a decrease of less than 3%. However, it is not clear whether Plumb et al. (2003) accounted for initial plume chemistry, as their results refer to \u2018background atmosphere\u2019 effects. Meijer et al. (1997) reported similar plume impacts on aircraft induced O3 perturbations to Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000a, Kraab\u00f8l et al., 2000b; however, when they included O3 conversion factors, i.e. similar to Kraab\u00f8l et al. the changes were reduced to 0\u20135% in January and \u22125 to 10% in July such that an increase in O3 was found in summer. Hence, all studies concluded that the inclusion of plume processes reduce the annual and global mean O3 increase from air traffic by maximum of approximately 10%. Where detailed chemical models are used (or data from underlying studies that use such models), the assumed initial emissions concentrations of OH are of the order 10 ppm (e.g. K\u00e4rcher, 1996, Tremmel et al., 1998). The emission of OH will strongly control the initial conversion of NOx to NOy species in the plume, particularly HNO3. However, more recent measurements (see Section 3.2.3 and Wilson et al., 2004) do not support such large OH concentrations and suggest levels of the order 1\u201310 ppb. This will have an influence on the global model studies that attempt to account for this factor, probably reducing the O3 reduction.",

            "text": "As has been outlined above, background emissions (e.g. industry, lightning, etc.) have a large impact on the tropospheric NOx concentrations and hence overall O3 production since the chemistry is non-linear, as shown from measurements (e.g. Jaegl\u00e9 et al., 1998). Grewe et al. (2002a) used surface NOx emissions of 31.1 Tg N for 1992 and updated the surface emissions by using 40.0 Tg N for 1992, which increased the aircraft induced ozone perturbation by 50%. Similar sensitivities have been found previously (Isaksen et al., 1999) with regard to both strength and regional pattern of background emissions. This indicates the importance of accurately simulating the background atmospheric conditions. In the TRADEOFF and QUANTIFY projects, the emission scenarios were constrained for all models, which led to considerably lower model-to-model differences than for other multi-modelling studies (e.g. AEROCHEM2). Lightning emissions of NOx are estimated to have a magnitude of the order 5 Tg N yr\u22121 (e.g. Schumann and Huntrieser, 2007: 5 \u00b1 3 Tg N yr\u22121; Boersma et al., 2005: 1.1\u20136.7 Tg N yr\u22121) with large uncertainties (Labrador et al., 2005). However, they also partly occur, like air traffic emissions, in the UT, where they have a larger impact on O3 than surface emissions of NOx. Modelling studies suggest that an increase in lightning emissions from 5 to 10 Tg N yr\u22121 (the upper end of this range may be unrealistic), decreases the air traffic O3 perturbation by between 15 and 50% (Isaksen et al., 1999, Brasseur et al., 1996) from the lower OPE at greater background levels of NOx. Moreover, in a number of studies, it has been found that the type of parameterization and vertical lightning emission profile also has an impact on the O3 perturbation (e.g. Tie et al., 2002, Grewe et al., 2002a, Grewe et al., 2002b, Labrador et al., 2005), which was found to be of the order 20% by Grewe et al., 2002a, Grewe et al., 2002b but larger by others (Labrador et al., 2005).",

Firstly, aviation-induced changes in the chemical composition lead to changes in radiative forcing and climate parameters, which in turn may change the aircraft-induced chemical perturbations. However, these changes are too small to produce a significant feedback on the perturbations (Grewe et al., 2002a). Note that this may change in the case of supersonic transport (see below). Secondly, future climate change (warming of the atmosphere) will alter atmospheric characteristics and may change the impact of aviation emissions: climate change is likely to result in greater H2O and hence OH concentrations, but also different HNO3 wash-out patterns and strengths (e.g. Johnson et al., 1999, Grewe et al., 2001). However, these results are affected by the climate sensitivity assumed (Gauss et al., 2006). Grewe et al. (1999) found that if the effects of climate change were included in a simulation, a decrease in air traffic (year 2015) induced O3 perturbation of 10\u201315% resulted, mainly because of more efficient HNO3 formation and removal.",

Instead, changes in CH4 loss are estimated by tropospheric OH changes. Methane lifetime changes are therefore subsequently deduced (see e.g. Fuglestvedt et al., 1999, Derwent et al., 1999).

The O3 increases were found to be quite rapid, but declined in the third month (Fig. 15\n), whereas the CH4 decrease was more persistent because of its longer lifetime. Stevenson et al.

Since model studies were based on different emission scenarios with differing total emissions, the specific RF is highlighted, i.e. that relative to the annual aircraft NOx emissions, which focuses on the model's sensitivity between emission and RF rather than differences arising from different emission scenarios. The results show a specific RF of 36.9 \u00b1 10.4 (mW m\u22122)/(Tg N yr\u22121) for O3 and \u221223.2 \u00b1 7.2 (mW m\u22122)/(Tg N yr\u22121) for CH4, i.e. the standard deviation amounts to 30%. For all models, the absolute O3 RF was larger than that for the CH4 RF. The ratio is 1.65 \u00b1 0.36 and shows a much smaller standard variation of around 20%, compared with individual forcings. Note that this number is dependent on the 3-D distribution of air traffic emissions and that regional changes could change this relationship. Specific RFs from the IPCC (1999) may be readily calculated, yielding 39.4 (mW m\u22122)/(Tg N yr\u22121) for O3 and \u221224.0 (mW m\u22122)/(Tg N yr\u22121) for CH4 with an absolute O3/CH4 ratio of 1.64 (all 1992 conditions). The picture is somewhat complicated by the evident non-linearity of response, since future scenarios (2015, 2050) yield different results, with a declining rate of response for O3 with higher NOx emissions, as might be expected. Results from the TRADEOFF project (Sausen et al., 2005) yielded 38.5 (mW m\u22122)/(Tg N yr\u22121) for O3 and 15.8(mW m\u22122)/(Tg N yr\u22121) for CH4. It appears that the specific RF for O3 has decreased slightly over the last 10 years with model improvements; however, there is much variability in the results presented here (Table 7). In terms of specific forcing, O3 RF from all sources (using IPCC, 2001 emissions and RF) is 6.7 (mW m\u22122)/(Tg N yr\u22121) for O3.",

The use of annually varying meteorological analyses led to an inter-annual variability in the modelled transport of aircraft-emitted NOx and H2O from the North Atlantic flight corridor. The resulting O3 perturbations exhibited an inter-annual variability of \u223c50 ppb in the middle stratosphere, which was of a similar magnitude to the differences between the O3 perturbations calculated by models in Isaksen et al.

            "text": "To understand fully the inter-annual variability of the results, it is necessary to consider the global transport of aircraft emissions in the stratosphere. The zonal mean background distribution of N2O, used as a dynamical tracer, at an altitude of 32 km was studied by Rogers et al. (2000) as a function of the meteorological year (Fig. 18\n, panel A). It should be noted that this altitude corresponds to the region of maximum potential O3 loss from supersonic aircraft emissions. Large N2O values indicate regions of ascent (e.g. tropics), while smaller N2O values indicate regions of descent (e.g. high latitudes). Fig. 18 (panel A) shows the inter-annual variability of the N2O distribution revealing the variation in dynamical circulation between different meteorological years such that larger N2O values in the tropics suggest periods of stronger ascent. Stronger descent at the Poles was revealed by smaller N2O values. As expected, periods of strong Polar descent are, in general, accompanied by large Polar O3 values, from the transport of O3-rich air from aloft. The zonal mean background distribution of NOy, a dynamical tracer, at an altitude of 32 km is studied as a function of the meteorological year. The change in NOy, from future supersonic aircraft, shows a pattern somewhat similar to that observed in the background N2O distribution with increases in NOy in the tropics particularly during 1994 meteorological conditions (Fig. 18, panel B). This study therefore suggests that the stronger ascent observed in the tropics for the meteorology in 1994 produced an enhanced upward transport of aircraft emissions from the lower stratosphere (Rogers et al., 2000). The resulting increase in NOy (and hence NOx) in the middle stratosphere leads to reduced O3 concentrations in the region where NOx dominates the O3 destruction.",

            "text": "The NASA High Speed Research Program conducted an extensive evaluation of the effects of emissions from supersonic aircraft on the stratospheric O3 layer. The study of Baughcum et al. (2003) evaluated the effect of fleet size, cruise altitude, NOx emission levels, water vapour emissions and sulphate emissions on O3. In their study, a two-dimensional model was used to evaluate parametrically the O3 impact of supersonic aircraft as a function of fleet fuel use at cruise altitudes, EINOx, and cruise altitude. In Baughcum et al. (2003) the sensitivity of the O3 impact calculated with the CSIRO model (Randeniya et al., 2002) was evaluated as a function of the choice of reaction rate constants. The version of the model using the JPL 1997 chemical kinetics assessment (DeMore et al., 1997) predicted larger O3 perturbations than did calculations presented by IPCC (1999). These differences arose both from changes in the model transport and the use of the updated JPL reaction rate coefficients and photolysis cross-sections. This resulted in a greater sensitivity of O3 depletion to NOx emission levels than in the previous assessment. Updating the reaction rate constants and photolysis cross sections in line with the JPL 2000 assessment of chemical kinetics (Sander et al., 2000), resulted in an increase the calculated O3 dependence on EINOx, because of the greater accumulation of exhaust emissions and the NOx being transported to higher altitudes where NOx chemistry dominates the O3 removal process. The partial update to the JPL 2002 recommendations (Sander et al., 2003) resulted in a further increase in the impact, but not as large as that for the change from JPL 1997 to JPL 2000 chemistry (Fig. 19a).",

The black line with the symbol \u201c+\u201d in Fig. 19 represents the SLIMCAT model calculation with updated reaction rates (Sander et al., 2000). This result contrasts with the IPCC assessment, which suggested that the impact of supersonic aircraft on the atmosphere was primarily through the role of water vapour emissions both on atmospheric O3 and climate change. This significant difference results from the inclusion of new kinetic data in SLIMCAT atmospheric chemical transport model. With the inclusion of the updated rates, an increase in the EINOx has a significant effect on the O3 column, with a reduction in the Northern Hemisphere O3 column of \u22123.2% for an EINOx of 15. The reason for the large dependence of the column O3 on the EINOx can be seen by considering that in the IPCC (1999) assessment, a cross-over point in the O3 chemical production and destruction terms from NOx chemistry, could be seen at an altitude of \u223c20 km. With the new kinetic data, the cross-over point is at a much lower altitude in the SLIMCAT calculations. With the injection of supersonic aircraft emissions at \u223c18 km almost all NOx and H2O emissions now take place in the region of O3 chemical destruction. This has resulted in an O3 decrease throughout the stratosphere and therefore in the O3 column. This conclusion underlines the potential impact of a fleet of supersonic aircraft on the atmosphere and emphasises the necessity to continue to develop low NOx combustion engines for the future, as well as the importance of maintaining state of the art kinetic data and updating assessments of impacts.",

This mid-stratospheric O3 increase was found to be larger than the O3 decrease below 20 km, because of the reduced O3 production from NOx and more O3 depletion by increasing ClO and BrO. However, the net effect of aircraft aerosol emissions on the O3 column can be highly model-dependent, being a function of the NOx removal efficiency from the aircraft emission region by large-scale transport (Rogers et al., 2002a). The faster is the removal rate, the larger is the mid-stratospheric impact on O3.",

Microphysical simulations using domain-filling trajectories were performed in order to investigate the influence on Artic PSC formation and the properties of enhanced concentrations of HNO3 and H2O, caused by aircraft emissions in year 2015 scenarios. The results showed that increased concentrations of HNO3 and H2O, of the order of 5\u201310%, emitted from a combined fleet of subsonic and supersonic fleet, would have a direct influence on the thermodynamic threshold temperatures for the existence of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT), super-cooled ternary solutions (STS), and ice in the Northern Hemisphere Polar stratosphere (Fig. 20\n). This may cause the frequency of occurrence of temperatures below these thresholds to increase by 2\u20135% and may enhance Type 1b PSC equilibrium volumes by about 10%. Increased concentrations of water vapour, caused by stratospheric aircraft emissions, imply higher freezing temperatures for ice in PSC particles, required for the formation of solid type of PSC particles.

They found that atmospheric tracers are significantly affected by H2O and O3 radiative feedbacks on the stratospheric circulation; one consequence is that dynamically driven O3 changes have to be taken into account along with chemically produced ones. The spatial distribution of stratospheric H2O and O3 (as well as other long-lived tracers) was determined by the stratospheric residual circulation, which could be perturbed by upsetting the latitudinal gradients of radiatively active gases. This is the case of lower stratospheric in situ H2O emissions from future supersonic aircraft: an increase of approximately 10% at Northern mid to high latitudes was predicted when treating H2O as a passive tracer (see also IPCC, 1999). The consequently larger H2O latitudinal gradient increases the pole-to-equator gradient of long-wave heating rates. Consequentially, the net effect may be that of a slight reinforcement of the stratospheric Brewer-Dobson circulation with enhanced tropical upwelling and mid-latitude subsidence. This change perturbs the O3 distribution as well, producing more tracer accumulation in the extra tropical lowermost stratosphere. The globally averaged column O3 change, was found to increase from +0.05% in the fixed circulation case to +0.6% in the radiatively interactive case. This net O3 increase is a consequence of the enhanced mid-latitude downwelling branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation, which transports more O3 close to the tropopause, where the chemical loss is slower than at higher altitudes.",

(2003b) suggested that the stratospheric adjusted radiative forcing for perturbations to O3 were within the range of the results presented by the IPCC (1999 \u2013 see Prather et al., 1999). However, their evaluation of the RF for the H2O perturbation suggests that IPCC (1999) may have overestimated the stratospheric adjusted RF for the H2O changes. Pitari et al. (2001) have shown that once H2O and O3 radiative feedbacks on the stratospheric circulation are accounted for, the dynamically interactive H2O accumulation may be substantially different from that resulting from a passive tracer treatment. They found a reduction in H2O accumulation at the tropical lower stratosphere, due to the above discussed stratospheric circulation reinforcement. This produced a significant reduction of the HSCT H2O climate forcing. A different conclusion was reached in the SCENIC project when the E39/C CCM (Hein et al., 2001) was used: in this case the stratospheric accumulation of H2O from supersonic aircraft was found to increase when the radiative feedbacks were included, because of a tropical tropopause layer (TTL) warming produced by the supersonic aircraft emissions net RF (a warming not predicted by Pitari et al., 2001). These findings support the earlier conclusions of Rind and Lonergan (1995) that the magnitude of the direct climate forcing produced by an HSCT aircraft fleet is sufficiently large that it is important to consider the effect of the feedbacks when estimating the climatic/dynamic response to such aircraft emissions.",

The range of resultant forcings from the same emissions scenario can partly be explained by the variability in the differently simulated total water vapour increase: the CTM2, ULAQ and SLIMCAT models show the same response with 0.37 \u00b1 0.02 mW m\u22122 Tg\u22121, whereas the E39/C model shows 0.28 mW m\u22122 Tg\u22121: this smaller response is likely to have resulted from the larger H2O background in the E39/C model, leading to saturation effects (Forster et al., 2001). The ULAQ radiation scheme showed a factor of 2 higher values than the E39/C model, employing the same H2O perturbation and background field (Table 8). These results are consistent with previous findings (IPCC, 1999), which showed an uncertainty of a factor of two in the calculation of the water vapour related RF, with lower values derived with E39/C model, compared with a narrow band model (Forster and Shine, 1997).",

For the aerosols, both the direct forcing (i.e. scattering and absorption of incoming solar radiation) and indirect forcing produced by changes of chemical species (i.e. O3) affected by heterogeneous chemical processes on the surface of aerosol particles were calculated. The direct impact of aircraft SO4 aerosols on RF was negative from scattering of solar radiation; the direct RF in the long-wave spectrum, on the other hand, was found to be negligible because of the small size of these particles. The RF from supersonic aircraft emissions of SO4 aerosols ranged from about \u22124 to \u221223 mW m\u22122. Black carbon aerosols, on the other hand, normally give a positive RF since they effectively absorb incident solar radiation (the single scattering albedo is close to 0.7, whereas it is unity for SO4 particles). As in the case of SO4, the small size of aircraft particles produced a negligible RF in the long-wave spectrum. The calculated RF from aircraft emissions of BC from supersonic aircraft ranged from about 0.4 to 11 mW m\u22122.",

Although the underpinning mechanisms are well understood, quantification of these effects is still difficult because of the effects of other atmospheric processes (chemical or dynamical) which act in parallel. Similarly difficult is the prediction of these effects for future atmospheres. Once the changes in the aforementioned atmospheric factors (clouds, ozone and aerosols) are known, the calculation of changes in UV radiation levels at a given location and time is straightforward, through the use of radiative transfer models (RTMs). Such calculations have been made in the past (IPCC, 1999 \u2013 see Ryan et al., 1999), showing that surface erythemal irradiance around the middle of the 21st century may increase by less than 1% at all latitude bands as a result of introducing supersonic aircraft in the future fleet. Without supersonic aircraft the erythemal irradiance was predicted to decrease, also by less than 1%.

The UV calculations were based on predictions from the ULAQ CCM (Pitari and Mancini, 2001) which was run for the SCENIC project emission scenarios, specific for future supersonic aircraft emissions (Grewe et al., 2007). The ULAQ CCM provided ozone columns and profiles, profiles of aerosol optical properties (optical thickness and single scattering albedo), and temperature profiles for 2050, representing the average of simulations for the period 2046\u20132055. These estimates were used as inputs to the Libradtran RTM (Mayer and Kylling, 2005) to calculate the daily erythemal irradiance changes between different scenarios under cloud-free conditions. The effect from possible changes in cloudiness has not been considered since, presently, the aviation-induced changes in cirrus clouds could not be distinguished from changes arising from natural variability, climate change or other anthropogenic effects (IPCC, 2007a, IPCC, 2007b). The calculated monthly changes in erythemal UV irradiance at local noon for 6 scenarios relative to the base scenario, which includes only subsonic aircraft (SUB), are shown in Fig. 22\n. The changes are averaged over the extra-tropical latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, where the bulk of the aircraft emissions occur. In all cases these changes are positive and smaller than 1%. The largest differences, although still very small, appear in the P3 scenario with a maximum in the spring season. The P5 and MIX scenarios produce the second largest changes, with maxima in the spring-summer periods. Finally P2, P4 and P6, make little difference to surface erythemal irradiance. In the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere the changes (not shown) are even smaller.",

The \u2018best\u2019 option would then be when both bars are minimal. With a constant RPK, the P4 (reduced speed) and the P6 (reduced cruise altitude) options offer the minimal impacts. The P5 scenario (range increase) also has a smaller impact for the combined effect (temperature and O3 layer) than the base case. However, the increase in range leads to more air routes to South East Asia, which results in more emissions in the tropical tropopause layer and therefore a more intense transport of emitted NOx into the stratosphere, so that O3 destruction is enhanced in the scenario P5, compared with the base case. The error bars indicate the minimum and maximum values that can be obtained including all uncertainties discussed in the previous sections, such as model-dependent chemical perturbation, RF calculations and climate sensitivity. Accounting for this uncertainty, the scenarios P4 and P6 both minimize the environmental impact. Both measures can be combined by calculating the product (green bars), which better visualizes the results.",

            "text": "Aircraft produce persistent contrails in the upper troposphere in ice-supersaturated air masses and these are routinely observed to shear and spread, producing additional cloudiness termed contrail-cirrus, often forming \u2018fall streaks\u2019 (Heymsfield et al., 1998, Atlas et al., 2006). Contrails are thin line-shaped cirrus clouds, which reflect solar radiation and trap outgoing terrestrial radiation. The latter effect is expected to dominate for thin cirrus (Stephens and Webster, 1981, Hartmann et al., 1992, Meerk\u00f6tter et al., 1999) which results in a net positive RF value for contrails. Persistent contrail cover has been calculated on a global basis from meteorological reanalysis data (Sausen et al., 1998) or by using a modified cirrus cloud parameterization in a GCM (Ponater et al., 2002, Marquart et al., 2003). Calculations of contrail cover depend upon the extent of supersaturated regions in the atmosphere. This extent is poorly known, but the probability of ice supersaturated regions has been characterized in regions where aircraft typically fly using data from MOZAIC by Gierens et al., 1999a, Gierens et al., 1999b and a global climatology of ice-supersaturated regions has been developed using data from both MLS5\nand AIRS6\n(Spichtinger et al., 2003, Gettleman et al., 2006). Differences between these climatologies and the MOZAIC data are thought to be due to the characteristic sampling volumes for the satellite data as well as the inability of MLS to distinguish adequately between water vapour and thin cirrus. The recent extension of ice supersaturation in the ECMWF integrated forecast system allows the possibility of future assessments based on analysed data or forecast systems (Tompkins et al., 2007).",

The large number of small ice crystals that are present in contrails may be heated by long-wave radiation from the ground, causing an instability that leads to uplift and causes further supersaturation with the consequent formation of additional cloudiness (Jensen et al., 1998a). Alternatively, the regions of depleted supersaturation in the contrail core may mix with supersaturated regions outside the contrail, allowing further growth of the contrail particles and their eventual precipitation out of the region, followed by further mixing of supersaturated areas and areas of the contrail core (Heymsfield et al., 1998). The ratio of the areal coverage of such cloudiness to that from line-shaped contrails, termed the \u2018spread factor\u2019, was estimated to be 1.8 by Minnis et al. (2004). The estimate of Mannstein and Schumann (2005) should no longer be cited since a similar increase in cirrus coverage with air traffic density has been estimated using the ECHAM4 climate model with natural cirrus only (Mannstein and Schumann, 2007). Estimates of the radiative effects of this additional cloudiness have also been attempted based upon trends in cirrus cloudiness (see Section 7.3 \u2013 Boucher, 1999, Fahey et al., 1999, Zerefos et al., 2003, Minnis et al., 2004, Stordal et al., 2005, Stubenrauch and Schumann, 2005, Eleftheratos et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Estimates of contrail RF are available from a number of studies (Minnis et al., 1999, Marquart and Mayer, 2002, Marquart et al., 2003, R\u00e4del and Shine, 2008, Stuber and Forster, 2007) that use coverage calculated either externally (e.g. Sausen et al., 1998) or internally within a GCM. Whilst the earliest studies assumed a specified optical depth of the contrails (e.g. Minnis et al., 1999), the most recent parameterizations within GCMs have allowed contrail optical depth to be predicted (Ponater et al., 2002), although some recent studies still prescribe an optical depth (e.g. Stuber and Forster, 2007, R\u00e4del and Shine, 2008). Marquart et al. (2003) used this predicted optical depth within the ECHAM GCM to determine a radiative forcing in 1992, 2015, and 2050 of 3.5 mW m\u22122, 9.4 mW m\u22122, and 14.8 mW m\u22122, respectively. These estimates did not include diurnal variations in traffic density but an estimate of this effect resulted in a 10% decrease in the net forcing for 1992. Other studies, however, have shown that the daily cycle of air traffic can be quite important (Meerk\u00f6tter et al., 1999, Myhre and Stordal, 2001, Stuber et al., 2006, Stuber and Forster, 2007). For example, Stuber and Forster (2007) found that 60% of the global annual mean forcing is associated with night flights, even though only 40% of the distance travelled by aircraft is during the night. Myhre and Stordal (2001) used the Sausen et al. (1998) contrail coverage distribution and the diurnal variation from Schmitt and Brunner (1997) to estimate a reduced forcing of 9 mWm\u22122 compared with their estimate of 11 mW m\u22122 when diurnal variations were not included. Stuber and Forster (2007) used the ECMWF forecast fields to predict contrail cover (outside of the Bakan et al. (1994) region to which all studies tuned their predicted cover) and found an estimated forcing for 1992 of 2.0 mWm\u22122 (and 2.4 mWm\u22122 without the diurnal cycle) (Stuber and Forster, 2007). Both Myhre and Stordal (2001) and Stuber and Forster (2007) assume the contrail optical depth (0.3 and 0.1, respectively) whereas the optical depth in Marquart et al. (2003) is predicted. Contrail optical thickness has been found to be greater over the United States than over Western Europe (Palikonda et al., 2005, Meyer et al., 2002, Ponater et al., 2002), a feature that is captured in the Marquart et al. (2003) simulations.",

Both quantities are not well known, although model-derived values of contrail cover seem to be similar. This, however, is a consequence of the adjustment of the modelled contrail cover to an observed value in the region 35\u201375\u00b0N and \u221230\u00b0W to 30\u00b0E (Bakan et al., 1994). Unfortunately, this observation (based on visual inspection of satellite scenes) is itself rather uncertain. Most striking is the decrease in contrail coverage between the periods 1979\u20131981 and 1989\u20131992 over Western Europe in that study, despite the increase in air traffic. The observed annual cycle has a maximum in spring/summer which is contrary to expectations based on the annual cycle of upper tropospheric relative humidity (Sausen et al., 1998) and is contrary to results from automatic contrail detection (Mannstein et al., 1999). Bakan et al. also reported a considerable interannual variability with root mean square values of contrail cover of the same magnitude as the average values themselves. The reported averages are often taken to refer to a base year of 1992, but actually, they are some mixture of base years one decade apart, over which period air traffic increased substantially. Later studies (e.g. R\u00e4del and Shine, 2008) considered more recent years and accounted for the air traffic increase when using the Bakan et al. value for adjustment. However, even if the annual growth factor were known, it is not clear from which year onwards one should apply the growth factor. Last, but not least, visual inspection is a highly subjective method. Mannstein et al. (1999) found that contrail cover derived by various trained observers differed by a factor of 2.",

While the GCM has twice as much contrail coverage over Europe than the contrail detection algorithm gives, the situation is the opposite over South East Asia where the contrail detection algorithm sees more than 50% greater contrail coverage than the GCM. Although part of this discrepancy is due to the different base years of the satellite observations and the GCM simulation, this shows that the normalization factor is not constant over the globe or that the GCM algorithm does not capture the correct regional variation. Gierens et al., 1999a, Gierens et al., 1999b showed that the adjustment factor depends on whether fuel consumption or flown distance is used as a measure of air traffic. When flown distances are used instead of fuel use, the computed contrail coverage showed large regional differences from +15% over USA to \u221250% over SE Asia compared with the fuel-based parameterization.",

The latter has values from 10 to 100 \u03bcm in the literature for contrails older than 30 min. From this assumption, Meyer et al. (2002) derived a range of 0.1\u20130.2 for the average optical thickness of contrails over Europe; contrails over USA are on the average optically thicker.

Cirrus clouds come in a variety of forms, ranging from optically thick anvil cirrus, closely associated with deep convection, to optically thin cirrus layers frequently observed near the tropopause. Thick anvil cirrus is created by the detrainment of condensate from cumulus updrafts. After the convection diminishes, the remaining detached anvil can evolve to form optically thin cirrus layers as the ice crystals with large radii precipitate out of the anvil (Prabhakara et al., 1993, Wang et al., 1996). The formation of thin cirrus layers can also occur resulting from the synoptic scale uplift of a humid layer (Jensen et al., 1996, Jensen et al., 2005, Heymsfield and McFarquhar, 1996, Winker and Trepte, 1998).",

However, the impact of aircraft particles on ambient cirrus depends upon the type of ice nuclei present in the ambient atmosphere without aircraft emissions. The particles that initiate ice formation include externally mixed sulphate aerosols, which may homogeneously freeze if temperatures are less than 235 K and supersaturations are greater than 45% with respect to ice (Koop et al., 1998). Heterogeneous nucleation involves aerosol particles that serve as some kind of substrate that matches the crystalline structure of ice. Heterogeneous mechanisms include direct deposition from vapour to ice on a suitable nucleus (deposition nucleation) and freezing of previously condensed supercooled cloud or haze droplets, with the freezing initiated either by contact of a nuclei with the cloud or haze droplet (contact nucleation) or by a nuclei immersed within the cloud or haze droplet (immersion nucleation). Condensation nucleation, where water freezes as it condenses on a particle is also possible. There is still a lack of data on the concentrations and properties of heterogeneous ice nuclei (IN) in the upper troposphere. Measurements during the NASA CRYSTAL-FACE mission confirmed that mineral dust and metallic particles are common heterogeneous IN (Sassen et al., 2003, DeMott et al., 2003a, Cziczo et al., 2004). Analyses of ice nucleating aerosols collected in the upper troposphere during the Subsonic Aircraft: Contrail and Cloud Effects Special Study (SUCCESS) showed that carbonaceous and crustal particles dominated the number fraction of IN (Chen et al., 1998).",

            "text": "In the upper troposphere, the importance of heterogeneous IN in cirrus cloud formation is largely unknown owing to a lack of information on the properties and abundances of IN, competition between different nucleation modes, and the dynamical factors that affect ice nucleation. Heymsfield and Miloshevich (1993) and Jensen and Toon (1994) concluded that homogeneous nucleation of supercooled drops is responsible for the occurrence of ice. However, DeMott et al. (1994) argued that even a small number of heterogeneous IN can initiate ice formation earlier at lower RHI, suppressing homogeneous nucleation, and changing cirrus cloud properties. DeMott et al. (1997) showed that if insoluble particles were at least 10% of the total number concentration and updrafts were less than 20 cm s\u22121, they would determine the ice number concentration. On the other hand, Hoyle et al. (2005) demonstrated that the high ice crystal number concentrations (0.1\u201350 cm\u22123) measured in cirrus clouds during the SUCCESS mission could only be explained by taking small-scale temperature fluctuations into account (which produce larger cooling rates equivalent to larger updrafts) and assuming that the freezing of ice occurs homogeneously. The formation of a tropopause cirrus cloud layer observed during CRYSTAL-FACE was reproduced using a model with ice nucleation via homogeneous freezing of sulphate aerosols that included the observed temperature perturbations (Jensen et al., 2005). It seems likely, based on the analysis of the Interhemispheric Differences in Cirrus Properties From Anthropogenic Emissions (INCA) project measurements of RHI, which show less frequent observation of RHI above about 130% outside of clouds in the Northern Hemisphere compared with the Southern Hemisphere, that a heterogeneous freezing mode occurs at least in some Northern mid-latitude cirrus clouds (Haag et al., 2003, see Fig. 24\n). Heterogeneous IN have a non-linear impact on the cirrus occurrence, optical extinction, and the fraction of clouds that are sub-visible, due to the competition between the homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation mechanisms (Haag and K\u00e4rcher, 2004).",

In regions where homogenous freezing of solution droplets is the dominant formation pathway for cold cirrus without aircraft emissions, the addition of heterogeneous IN would be expected to decrease ice number concentrations or, possibly, to increase cirrus cloud coverage. But, if the ambient atmosphere is dominated by heterogeneous IN from sources other than aircraft, the addition of more heterogeneous IN would be expected to increase ice number concentrations (Hendricks et al., 2005). The former effect could lead to either a positive, or a negative RF. A negative RF would result if the areal coverage of cloud ice water path were undisturbed, but ice number concentrations were decreased, while a positive RF may result if ice coverage increases. An increase in ice number concentrations, with no change in areal coverage of ice water path, would be expected in regions dominated by heterogeneous ice nucleation and would lead to a positive RF.",

(2003). Nucleation-mode aerosol concentrations are important, since these particles may determine the total aerosol number concentration and are able to grow to sizes that would act as homogeneous nuclei for cirrus formation through coagulation and condensation. Over the Pacific Ocean, Clarke and Kapustin (2002) found evidence of nucleation-mode (Dp > 3 nm) particles (\u224810,000 cm\u22123 \u00b1 25,000 at STP) when refractory particle concentrations were small relative to volatile concentrations. Some models that include binary nucleation of sulphate aerosols from gas phase H2SO4 capture the trends in these data, but with somewhat higher concentrations at some locations (Spracklen et al., 2005), while others predict smaller concentrations by about a factor of 10 (Lauer et al., 2005). By contrast, the nucleation-mode (Dp > 5 nm) measurements by Minikin et al. (2003) near Punta Arenas in the Southern Hemisphere and near Scotland in the Northern Hemisphere and in the Southern Hemisphere LACE campaign (Petzold et al., 2002) were significantly smaller (median: 350 cm\u22123 with a 25 and 75 percentile range from 180 to 830 cm\u22123 and median: 1400 cm\u22123 with a 25 and 75 percentile range from 450 to 15,000 cm\u22123, in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere INCA campaign, respectively, and median 800 cm\u22123 with a 25 and 75 percentile range from 400 to 1100 cm\u22123 at STP in the Northern Hemisphere European LACE campaign).

Str\u00f6m and Ohlsson (1998) found that the concentrations of absorbing material in ice could be as high as 0.1 \u03bcg m\u22123 (average 0.03 \u03bcg m\u22123) which is 4000 times larger than observed concentrations of soot in the upper troposphere (Schwarz et al., 2006) and were probably associated with an aircraft plume age of about 1 h. Thus, it is only a small fraction of the ambient soot aerosol that acts as ice nuclei. Kristensson et al. (2000) report a decrease in effective diameter of 10\u201330% in cirrus clouds perturbed by aircraft, a finding which is not observed at temperatures warmer than \u221230 \u00b0C. This finding may imply that aircraft BC act as effective heterogeneous IN (i.e. at lower relative humidities than those required for ice formation on sulphate) in ambient cirrus that also form on IN or that the cirrus found in these corridors are aged contrail cirrus, where conditions are known to be such that aircraft soot does act as an IN.",

(2007) report concentrations of <0.01 cm\u22123 at STP of IN at cirrus temperatures in April and May (2004) and November (2001) in the free troposphere over the western US, indicating that not all refractory particles can act as ice nuclei (if those measured during the INCA campaign are also typical for the western U.S.). This is consistent with the report by Seifert et al. (2003) that scavenging ratios (fraction of ambient particles included in crystals) were <1% in the INCA campaign. Seifert et al. also showed that the ice crystal number density is dominated by residual particles with diameters of less than 0.1 \u03bcm, and, in this size range, high interstitial number concentrations are not necessarily associated with high ice crystal number concentrations. For particles larger than this, there is a correlation between crystal number concentration and interstitial number concentration.",

Number concentrations for particles with maximum dimension above 100 \u03bcm at temperatures below \u221240 \u00b0C ranged 10\u22124\u2013104 L\u22121, but were most often between 0.01 and 0.1 cm\u22123. Unfortunately, the numbers of particles with sizes below 100 \u03bcm could not be reliably counted in these early experiments. Table 10\nprovides a summary of ice crystal concentrations and sizes for experiments since 1990. The microphysical properties of cirrus clouds have been studied by using satellite (Ou et al., 1998), ground-based remote sensing (Intrieri et al., 1993, Mace et al., 1998), and in situ measurements (Str\u00f6m and Heintzenberg, 1994). However, only a few measurements have attempted to quantify total ice crystal number in cirrus clouds, and the number of small particles is still controversial, since particle shattering within the inlet of airborne probes may cause over-counting (Korolev and Isaac, 2005, McFarquhar et al., 2007). Available measurements of ice crystal number concentrations (N\ni) have been made with a variety of instruments that do not always agree (Heymsfield and McFarquhar, 2002) and the temporal and spatial scatter of observed values is large. Measurements of ice crystal number concentration in cirrus clouds published since 1990 are summarized in Table 10. Notably, Gayet et al. (2004) found that the number concentration and size distribution of crystals in the Northern Hemisphere differs from that in the Southern Hemisphere. However, this finding should be confirmed given the wide spatial and temporal variations of these characteristics in cirrus.",

Both parameterization methods are able to represent the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation pathways, and to link the N\ni to aerosol properties, thus allowing a nucleation simulation that accounts for the effects of different aerosol types (sulphate, soot, and mineral dust). This calculation requires assumptions regarding the small-scale velocity perturbations responsible for forming regions with supersaturation, but a probability distribution for these updrafts, with a mean of 0 cm s\u22121 and a standard deviation of 0.33 cm s\u22121 seems a reasonable choice (Haag and K\u00e4rcher, 2004, K\u00e4rcher and Str\u00f6m, 2003). This off-line calculation did not include any feedbacks to the climate system, so does not provide any measure of the change in cloud coverage due to soot aerosols.

In the second version, only aerosol mass was predicted. In the latter model, aerosol number concentrations were diagnosed from the predicted sulphate and soot aerosol mass concentrations using an assumed size distribution whilst in the former, only soot size distributions were assumed. Since pure sulphate aerosol is highly soluble, it was assumed that it forms ice through homogeneous freezing after deliquescence. Soot particles are assumed to be efficient heterogeneous IN, with a freezing threshold RHI of \u223c130% in Liu and Penner (2005) and \u223c140% in K\u00e4rcher et al. (2006). Fig. 25\nshows the annual mean values of in-cloud ice number density N\ni at 140 hPa and 190 hPa. The two parameterization methods produced quite similar N\ni patterns indicating good agreement between the two parameterization methods, but the K\u00e4rcher parameterization (KL) has higher ice number concentrations in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere since ice nucleation is dominated by homogeneous nucleation in this region. The Liu and Penner (LP) parameterization has lower ice concentrations at these levels since lower RHI must be achieved for heterogeneous nucleation to activate in the LP parameterization. In both parameterizations, homogeneous ice nucleation produces higher N\ni and is a dominant mechanism for ice nucleation at high altitudes because of the very low temperature and high RHI there. At lower altitudes, heterogeneous ice nucleation becomes important and produces generally lower N\ni. The higher N\ni towards lower altitudes from the KL parameterization than those from the LP parameterization is caused by the higher freezing RHI threshold value for heterogeneous IN used in the KL parameterization.",

Aerosol concentrations were calculated from the coupled aerosol and climate models with present-day and pre-industrial emissions. An analytical formulation relating the ice effective radius (r\ne) to ice volume mean radius (r\nv) was derived using combined ice crystal size distributions (a gamma distribution for length less than 20 \u03bcm and a power-law distribution for larger particles) (Wyser, 1998). The ice crystal shape was assumed to be hexagonal columns. The global statistics of N\ni and r\ne occurrence probability with different emission scenarios were examined. There are two modes in the probability distributions for N\ni and r\ne, one at larger ice number concentrations, which is associated with homogeneous nucleation, and one at smaller ice number concentrations, which is associated with heterogeneous nucleation. These are shifted by adding anthropogenic soot: for the mode where homogeneous nucleation dominates (with higher N\ni and lower r\ne), an increase in the heterogeneous IN (soot) inhibits the ice formation through homogeneous nucleation, lowers N\ni and increases r\ne. However, for the mode where the heterogeneous nucleation dominates (with lower N\ni and higher r\ne), an increase in soot particles increases N\ni and lowers r\ne. Thus, the combined effects narrow both the N\ni and r\ne probability distributions. The addition of anthropogenic sulphate (through homogeneous ice nucleation) has little effect on N\ni and r\ne except in the Southern Hemisphere.",

            "text": "Changes to the ice crystal effective radius can have important implications for both the short-wave (SW) and long-wave (LW) radiation in cirrus clouds. Penner et al. (2009) estimated the RF at the top of atmosphere (TOA) arising from anthropogenic aerosols (see Fig. 26\n). The net RF (SW plus LW) of anthropogenic aerosols through effects on cirrus cloud ice number and effective radius can be both positive (i.e., LW forcing dominates over SW forcing), or negative (i.e., SW forcing dominates over LW forcing). SW and LW forcing in the tropics is particularly sensitive to aerosol changes because of the low temperatures in the upper troposphere and high cirrus cloud fractions there. In many regions of the tropics and in the South Pole where homogeneous ice nucleation dominates, the net forcing from anthropogenic soot is negative because of a reduction of ice number by adding soot. In other regions where heterogeneous ice nucleation dominates, a net positive forcing is expected because of an increase of ice number, and a reduction of r\ne. The global mean net TOA forcing ranges from \u22120.01 to +0.04 W m\u22122 from total anthropogenic sulphate for the KL and LP parameterizations, respectively and from \u22120.4 to \u22120.3 Wm\u22122 for soot from surface sources, and from \u22120.16 to \u22120.12 Wm\u22122 for aircraft soot (Penner et al., 2009). Calculated values based on the KL parameterization are shown in Fig. 26. These values were estimated using the version of the IMPACT model that predicts sulphate aerosol mass and number, but uses assumed size distributions for the other aerosol particles. When the version of the model that does not predict sulphate aerosol number concentration resulting from binary nucleation of H2SO4 vapour is used or when the relative humidity at which soot particles activate to form heterogeneous IN changes, the forcing may change. For example, the forcing associated with aircraft soot becomes positive (but near zero) when the mass only version of the model with the LP parameterization is used. Clearly, there is a need to refine these values and to understand the effects of changing aerosol concentrations on ice number concentration and size.",

Such studies have inherent uncertainty because they make use of observed correlations between aircraft fuel use/activity and cloudiness that may occur as a result of mechanisms that do not involve aircraft. Nevertheless, IPCC (1999 \u2013 see Fahey et al., 1999) used the difference in trend in cirrus coverage from surface-based observations (which are smaller than those from the then-current ISCCP data) inferred by Minnis et al. (2001) [proceedings referenced in Zerefos et al. (2003)] in regions predicted to have contrail coverage >0.5% (as inferred by Sausen et al., 1998) compared with the trend in regions predicted to have contrail coverage <0.5%, to place constraints on the forcing by the so-called \u2018aircraft-induced\u2019 cloudiness. The trend difference over land (where 84% of contrail coverage was expected) was 1.6%/decade for the period from 1971 to 1991, which implies an increase of 4.8% if extended over 30 years. This amounts to an increase of about 0.2% in total cirrus cloud cover. Assuming optical properties similar to those for contrails (i.e. optical depth 0.3, as assumed in IPCC (1999)), then the RF was estimated to be 40 mW m\u22122.",

For relating cirrus cover C and traffic density D they used an approach that takes overlapping of contrails and saturation effects (e.g. finite size of ice-supersaturated regions) into account: C\ntot(D) = C\n0 + C\npot[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212D/D\n\u2217)], where C\n0 is cover of natural cirrus, C\npot is the potential coverage of contrails and contrail cirrus (Sausen et al., 1998), and the term in square brackets is the fraction of C\npot that is actually covered by contrails. D* denotes the mean air traffic density that would lead in an ice-supersaturated region to a total coverage by cirrus clouds without any overlap. It was shown that the relation between additional cirrus coverage and air traffic density indeed followed roughly the exponential model. The main result of this study was that over Europe aviation was determined to be responsible for additional cirrus coverage of 3% (consistent with the result of Stordal et al.). This implies that the mean coverage of contrail cirrus over Europe exceeds the corresponding mean coverage of linear contrails by one order of magnitude. However, Mannstein and Schumann (2007) point out that the correlation found in Mannstein and Schumann (2005) was also found in some model simulations of natural cirrus, implying that the increase in cirrus with air traffic density is affected by spurious correlations of air traffic and natural cirrus coverage.",

The air traffic induced cirrus cover was smaller than that found in the Mannstein and Schumann (2005) study, namely 0.6 \u00b1 0.2% as regions with essentially no air traffic, of course, leading to smaller mean additional cirrus coverage have been included. Krebs also investigated the effect of the additional cirrus on the radiation budget of the earth based on satellite data. He found a warming of 1.1 W m\u22122 for the region of interest, a value that is more than eight times larger than the value estimated by Boucher (1999). As noted above, it is currently not clear how much of the correlation in this work between air traffic and cirrus cloudiness is actually due to a causal relationship.

It is of course difficult to prove a causal relationship from correlation statistics because of a number of factors, e.g natural variability, other climate change effects and cyclical influences (e.g. NAO). These other influences may be of the same magnitude or larger than the possible aviation effect. Some of the aforementioned studies have attempted to reduce the uncertainties arising from other factors by screening the data for them (e.g. Zerefos et al., 2003, Zerefos et al., 2007). Nonetheless, any correlation-type study will encounter such difficulties and it may be the case that little more can be learned from observational studies in the absence of process-type modelling that can be used to support the analysis. For example, a potentially serious limitation to the above studies that utilize data from the ISSCP project are artificial trends in the data set, e.g. due to changes in the satellite viewing geometry, as discussed by Evan et al.

The underlying Chapter 6 of the 1999 assessment presented a new measure, the radiative forcing index (RFI) for aviation, which was derived from the ratio of total instantaneous RF to that from CO2 alone.

The use of RFI for other sub-sectors would lead to nonsensical results. For example, dirty coal-fired power plants or maritime shipping is likely to have a zero or negative RFI in their first decade of growth because the direct and indirect cooling from the sulphate aerosols will offset the effect of CO2 emissions, although the CO2 will eventually emerge as the dominant RF.

            "text": "By its very nature, RF relates different timescales of atmospheric constituents in its formulation. RF is useful as a first-order metric to quantify climate impacts because of its relationship to global mean surface temperature change through the linear equation (1). Nevertheless, this relationship is often misinterpreted since the studies that relate RF to global mean surface temperature are steady state: i.e., the RF is held fixed for more than a century as the climate system responds. Unfortunately, the RF from aviation is an increasing, evolving mix of components: CO2 emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and its RF builds up while the RF from O3, CH4, aerosols, and contrails are in a quasi steady-state, reflecting only more recent emissions. The timescale for most of these atmospheric perturbations is less than a year, except for the 12-year response time of CH4 (Stevenson et al., 2006; see also Table 5, IPCC, 2001 chapter for CH4 feedback is needed here). For CO2, the range of time scales reflect the equilibration times with the different carbon reservoirs and the history of its emissions needs to be taken into account. For example, 1940 can be considered the beginning of significant aviation activities (Sausen and Schumann, 2000), whereas significant shipping emissions began in the late 19th Century (Eyring et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2007). The climate response to changes in RF has its own time scales. Even short-lived RF perturbations, such as that caused by Mt. Pinatubo, have decadal or longer impacts on climate. Thus, the complete history of RF, which includes shifts in the relative apportionment of different causes (e.g., O3 vs. CO2), is needed to attribute climate change both at present and in the near future.",

Global mean surface temperature change (\u0394T) is a more satisfactory metric than RF since it is closer to the real impacts or possibly the potential damage (Fuglestvedt et al., 2003), and moreover it incorporates the history of RF and the time scales of the climate system's response.",

Thus, whilst a short-term forcing response may be removed quickly by cessation of the activity or emission, e.g. contrails, the climate response in terms of \u0394T will only decay on much longer timescales if the atmosphere has been subjected to that forcing for some time. When the climate response timescale is coupled to the long lifetime of CO2, this means that if the emission source were removed the temperature response from past emissions would actually increase after the cessation of emissions before damping very slowly. This phenomenon was illustrated for aviation CO2 and O3 effects by Sausen and Schumann (2000), and the concept of residual future warming from past emissions is often referred to as unrealized or committed warming (e.g. Hansen et al., 1985, Friedlingstein and Solomon, 2005, Meehl et al., 2005)9\n. This is illustrated in two ways in Fig. 27\nusing a simple model that treats all the aviation forcing components (Lim et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2009). Panel A of Fig. 27 shows the RF responses of CO2, non-CO2 effects and total RF to the historical development of aviation emissions to year 2000, after which, emissions are \u2018switched off\u2019 in the model simulation. The non-CO2 RF goes negative after the cessation of emissions because of the lifetime of CH4, whilst the CO2 RF decays only slowly, in line with carbon sink timescales. The equivalent temperature responses of CO2 and non-CO2 forcing agents from aviation are shown in Fig. 27 panel B: here, because of the inertia of the climate system, the temperature response of the non-CO2 forcings decay slowly, and the CO2 temperature response decays even more slowly because of the timescales of response of carbon sinks, coupled with the response time of the climate system. Fig. 27 panel C shows an idealized pulse response case of RF, where a global aviation emissions are released for a year in proportion to those from the current-day fleet and the temperature decay response is followed (Fig. 27, panel D), showing the longer decay time for CO2 vs. non-CO2 forcings and the negative temperature response for the non-CO2 forcings being driven by CH4, switching to a positive long-term temperature response (many centuries) from the CO2 forcing. The decay time for a metric like \u0394T is extended because of the thermal inertia of the climate system, and even the total non-CO2 short-lived RF shows the decadal-timescale decay time of the climate system.",

This relationship is evaluated by holding RF fixed for centuries, or by following a transient forcing with RF increasing at a regular exponential rate. At first, \u03bb was considered to be constant for a given climate model, independent of the type of forcing (Cess et al., 1990, Cess et al., 1996), but further studies have shown that \u03bb is dependent to an extent on the type of perturbation, in particular for non-homogeneously forcings (Forster and Shine, 1997, Hansen et al., 1997, Joshi et al., 2003, Stuber et al., 2005) and also for some aviation forcings, including O3 and contrails (Ponater et al., 1999, Ponater et al., 2006). In other words, the same RF may produce a different temperature (or other climate diagnostic) response. This is sometimes described as the \u2018efficacy\u2019 (Hansen and Nazarenko, 2004, Hansen et al., 2005) and is defined as:(9)ri=\u03bbi\u03bbCO2,where \u03bbi and \u03bbCO2 are the climate sensitivity parameters associated with perturbations of the climate change agent i and of CO2, respectively. Aviation-specific efficacies have only been extensively studied with the ECHAM climate model (Ponater et al., 2006), see Table 11\n. However, since ri is a ratio, it should be relatively constant across different climate models. However, in the recent summary of results from the 2007 IPCC WG1 assessment (Forster et al., 2007a) this is not obvious and consistent values of ri for aviation forcings are still undemonstrated.",

It is possible to incorporate aviation-specific efficacies into such modelling. However, whilst the usage of SCMs is instructive and can provide analyses not possible with GCMs, they have the serious disadvantage that they operate on global mean forcings and temperature responses. For aviation, as is the case for other sectors, some of these forcings may be positive and some negative (e.g. shipping, see Eyring et al., 2009). This can give the spurious impression of a net zero RF having no temperature impact. The most obvious example for aviation is the positive O3 RF and negative CH4 RF arising from NOx emissions. For this example, IPCC (1999) showed that these forcings, although arising from the same emission, operated across different spatial scales and made the point that \u201c\u2026the latitudinal distribution of the radiative imbalance from these two perturbations does not cancel\u2026\u201d and that \u201cThe response of the climate system to such geographically non-homogeneous forcing is unknown.\u201d (IPCC, 1999 \u2013 Prather et al., 1999 Section 6.5.1).",

(2000) applied a range of idealized forcings with an intermediate GCM (IGCM) and found that forcing of the Northern Hemisphere (>30\u00b0N) gave a 40% greater climate sensitivity than at latitudes <30\u00b0N. In a study of climate sensitivity, Boer and Yu (2003a) found that the spatial structure of the temperature response to long-lived GHG (LLGHG) and sulphate forcings did not resemble the structure of the forcings, but the temperature response structure is rather driven by localized feedbacks. Boer and Yu (2003a) also note that forcings that occur in regions of positive feedbacks will produce comparatively large responses both locally and globally. However, elsewhere, Boer and Yu (2003b) also note that the global mean temperature response is proportional to global mean RF, broadly independent of the nature and pattern of the forcings in their simulations of LLGHG and sulphates. The case for aviation forcings, however may be more complex as there is evidence that the temperature response, particularly to O3, varies both by latitude and altitude in an idealized forcing experiment using three GCMs (Joshi et al., 2003).",

There is some evidence that the efficacy of some of these forcings deviates significantly from 1 but these are based on only limited experiments and principally from the ECHAM-4 GCM, such that other experiments are still needed. The issue of aviation forcings involving both positive and negative forcings and that some of them are heterogeneous in pattern makes the additivity \u2013 specifically the cancellation of climate impacts \u2013 a critical uncertainty in developing climate metrics to discuss control or mitigation strategies. There is added complexity for the impacts from NOx, aerosols, and clouds in that these depend on the location and even conditions (day-night) of the flight path (Shine et al., 2005a, Shine et al., 2007, Bernsten et al., 2006)",

Different time-horizons were chosen in order to illustrate the variability of values of GWP and GTP for the shorter-lived climate forcing agents. The time horizon of 50 years (TH50) for the GTP metric is used as such a time horizon may be consistent with that for stabilizing global temperature increase. Details on the input data and the way in which the metrics are calculated are provided by Fuglestvedt et al. (2009). For BC and sulphate particles, detailed modelling of the radiative effects of emissions from aviation has not been performed and the metric values for surface emissions are used in Table 13.

These are challenging objectives. Although they are principally achievable within the laws of physics, it requires important technological breakthroughs and new concepts of operation. It has been suggested that for the improvements in CO2, 40% will come from the airframe, 40% from the engine and 20% from improved operations. Similarly, technology objectives with regard to environmental performance of aircraft have been published for the United States (Anonymous, 2007). In this, near term (<5 yr), mid-term (5\u201310 yr) and far term (>10 yr) goals and objectives have been set. In terms of fuel performance, the reference airframe/engine combination is a B737-800 with CFM56/7B engines, representative of 1998 entry into service technology: for NOx, these are referenced against the CAEP2 NOx standard. The relevant goals and objectives are presented in Table 14\n. It should be noted that these are extracted from a much wider set of energy and environment R&D objectives and goals; the fuel efficiency and NOx standards are presented for comparison with the relevant ACARE Goals.",

The turnover time of the global aviation fleet is of the order of 25 years and so any technology improvements are only taken up slowly. If airlines purchase new cleaner technology before the useful operable lifetime of the aircraft is over, these aircraft are generally sold on (commonly to developing nations or to be converted into freighters) rather than retired from the fleet. Also, the context of growth needs to be considered: in determining the emissions impact, the essential question is whether technology improvements can keep pace (or outpace) with growth in the fleet \u2013 IPCC (1999) was pessimistic over this issue, stating \u201cAlthough improvements in aircraft and engine technology and in the efficiency of the air traffic system will bring environmental benefits, these will not fully offset the effects of the increased emissions resulting from the projected growth in aviation.\u201d (IPCC, 1999, Summary for Policy Makers).

Calculating these tradeoffs is by no means simple, either technologically or in the atmospheric context. For the atmosphere, these effects occur over very different timescales (see Section 8). Examples of technological tradeoffs include: a higher bypass ratio to reduce fuel consumption and aircraft noise implies greater engine weight and diameter, which at some point will increase fuel consumption once more, moreover this makes NOx control more difficult because of the higher temperatures and pressures at the combustor inlet. New operational procedures, e.g. a deviation to avoid an ice-supersaturated region for contrail avoidance, may increase travel time and fuel consumption. However, tradeoffs are also inherent in atmospheric physics and chemistry (e.g. flying in the stratosphere will reduce contrail and cirrus formation but the residence time of emissions will increase).",

Contrail formation is determined almost exclusively by principles of thermodynamics and the atmospheric conditions in which engine emissions are released. The theory of contrail formation can be cast into a simple equation, known as the Schmidt\u2013Appleman criterion (Schmidt, 1941, Appleman, 1953). The validity of the Schmidt\u2013Appleman theory has been demonstrated and confirmed on various research flights (Busen and Schumann, 1995, K\u00e4rcher et al., 1998a, Jensen et al., 1998b, IPCC, 1999, Schumann, 2000). This validation proves that thermodynamics is the controlling factor for contrail formation, not the physico-chemistry of the emitted particles. An in-depth derivation of the Schmidt\u2013Appleman theory has been given by Schumann (1996).",

The basic idea explored was to consider a hypothetical additive that would potentially coat soot particles such that they would not be able to act as condensation nuclei for water vapour. Gierens, 2007a, Gierens, 2007b showed that it would be necessary to produce a soot coating with a threshold water saturation ratio of about 1.4 for water condensation in order to decrease the maximum temperature allowing for contrail formation by 4 K. Unfortunately, this would be balanced by changes in the overall airframe propulsion efficiency expected by 2050. Thus, Gierens concluded that fuel additives were not a useful approach for contrail suppression.",

One possibility is to cool the exhaust air with an additional heat exchange unit (cooled by bypass air) such that water vapour can condense in the unit. In this way the emission index of water vapour can be substantially reduced which helps to suppress contrails (Noppel et al., 2007). A fraction of the condensed water can be injected into the combustion chamber in order to reduce NOx production. Haglind (2008) has investigated the idea to temporarily reduce the overall propulsion efficiency by using variable guide vanes in the engine fan when the aircraft flies through regions where persistent contrails are likely to form. Such a measure could decrease the threshold temperature for contrail formation by about 1.5 K, corresponding to a vertical distance of about 300 m, or 1000 ft (one flight level). In order to keep the price of such a contrail mitigation strategy low (increase in fuel consumption), such a method would have to be combined with operational measures as discussed below. Other technical possibilities to reduce contrail formation are discussed by Noppel and Singh (2007) but most of these are speculative and tend to ignore the overwhelming influence of the ambient atmosphere in contrail formation.",

Cryoplane contrails are predicted to have 1\u20132 orders of magnitude fewer ice crystals than contrails from equivalent kerosene-fuelled engines (Str\u00f6m and Gierens, 2002). Ice crystals in cryoplane contrails are predicted to be 4\u20136 times larger (linear dimension) than those in kerosene contrails, which renders them optically thinner and of lower duration. Severe technical requirements for the introduction of a cryoplane fleet imply that the benefits of LH2 technology will probably only appear in a timescale of 50 or more years (Ponater et al., 2006).",

The global mean radiative forcing by contrails was reduced almost proportionally to the contrail coverage, with strong seasonal and regional variability.

A 14-month dataset of ice-supersaturated layers and their thickness distribution is shown in Fig. 30\n. New developments in the capability of meteorological models, such as the ECMWF operational model, to predict ice supersaturated regions (Tompkins et al., 2007) are required to realise such a flexible strategy. Equipping a number of commercial airliners with humidity probes that are designed especially for use in the upper troposphere (including AMDAR; Aircraft Meteorological Data Reporting to the weather centres) would help aviation weather forecasts to more accurately predict ice-supersaturated regions. The analysis of Mannstein et al. (2005) was based upon an analysis of upper air in a single region of Germany, for which the majority of ice-supersaturated layers were approximately 510 m in thickness (with a standard deviation of 600 m). Other radiosonde-based studies of ice-supersaturation layers (Treffeisen et al., 2007 for Svalbard, Sweden; R\u00e4del and Shine, 2007, for southern England) found larger average thicknesses of ice-supersaturated regions (about 1 km), despite peak values of 100\u2013200 m in their thickness distributions. Currently, a general conclusion that only minor changes in height are necessary to avoid contrails may be inappropriate and certainly this aspect requires further and more extensive data and investigation.",

Fuel consumption can be reduced by several technical options, in particular drag and weight reductions are the two most promising technology options. However, radical changes in aircraft design are necessary to achieve substantial reductions in CO2, e.g. laminar-flow control and departure from the dominant swept-wing configuration. Propulsion efficiency can be enhanced by a transition to open rotor engines. However, open rotor engines (sometimes called \u2018unducted fans\u2019) have issues over safety (blade breakage) and noise impacts that would also have to be addressed. Thermal efficiency, however, can only be improved at the expense of increased NOx production in the absence of additional efforts in combustor design. Fuel savings are also possible when long-haul flights are done in a series of stages, which would allow a reduction in the amount of fuel required to be loaded. However, there are time, ATM and potential air quality costs that make this option most unlikely.",

It is possible to design them in a way that only slightly more fuel is needed than in fuel optimized engines (Green, 2003). It is notable that the ACARE targets call for reductions in fuel consumption and NOx, such that it should not necessarily be inferred that reduced NOx always results in increased fuel: this is a tendency, rather than an inevitable fact. It will take quite some years for these novel technologies to come into service. Moreover, there is no reason that they would voluntarily be introduced by the sector in the absence of any regulatory pressure or financial incentive. Potential operational options to reduce the effects of NOx (instead of reducing NOx itself) have also been investigated. The EC project TRADEOFF investigated two kinds of options, rerouting of a part of the flights to the far north (where the tropopause is low and flights are mainly in the lower stratosphere; additionally, during polar night there is no photochemistry) and displacing the traffic up or down (+2000 ft, \u22122000 ft, \u22124000 ft, \u22126000 ft). Chemical perturbations, contrail coverage changes and the corresponding radiative forcings were computed with a range of CTMs and GCMs, and with a linear response model.

They first performed a model simulation without aviation, then added aviation corresponding to year 2000. A comparison of these simulations showed that inclusion of aviation leads to a globally averaged increase in the ozone column (expressed in Dobson units, DU) of 0.34 DU (base case), or 0.39 DU when military aircraft operations are considered as well. Most of the increase (about 90%) occurs in the troposphere. These changes provided a base case around which sensitivity studies were conducted, changing routes and lower/higher flight levels. The additional changes in O3 column relative to the base case of most of these scenarios was of the order 0.01\u20130.03 DU (positive and negative), that is, at least ten times smaller than the effect of aviation itself, and even smaller than the effect of military operations. These relations are even more pronounced when the view is on the northern hemisphere only (see Gauss et al., 2006, their Table 3). Flying polar routes does not have an ozone penalty; during winter times when photochemistry is reduced or absent it even brings environmental benefits, cf lower latitude flights. The operational measures discussed would nevertheless cause spatial shifts in aircraft induced O3 production with possible consequences for radiative forcing, since O3 is a greenhouse gas with short lifetime. Preliminary studies (Stordal et al., 2006) indicate weak radiative effects. Hence we may conclude that, according to current knowledge, O3 effects from aircraft NOx emissions do neither favour any particular operational change in flight routings and altitudes, nor do they exclude them when for any reason (e.g. contrail avoidance) flying at different altitudes or Polar regions would turn out to be beneficial. Enhancing polar routes might have adverse climate effects for other reasons. The low tropopause at polar latitudes implies that a substantial fraction of emissions occur in the stratosphere where residence times are much longer than in the troposphere. Gauss et al. (2006) show how reactive nitrogen gases (NOy) accumulate much more in the atmosphere when more polar routes are selected than with every other scenario investigated. As a large fraction of NOy is HNO3, which can be washed out by rain and falling ice crystals, such an effect can only be exploited by flying within the troposphere. Grewe et al. (2002b) found that if overall cruise altitudes were reduced, then NOx emissions increased \u2013 however, less O3 was formed because of increased rates of chemical removal and washout of NOy species.",

(2003) investigated \u201cThe potential for renewable energy sources in aviation\u201d considering biodiesel (e.g. oilseed rape or soybean methyl ester), ethanol, methanol, synthetic kerosene, nuclear power, liquid hydrogen, and liquefied biomethane. Of these fuels, ethanol and methanol were considered unsuitable, particularly because of their low energy density (both by mass and volume). At low power conditions, the combustion of alcohols produces organic acids and aldehydes, with attendant air quality health hazards (Saynor et al., 2003). Nevertheless, ethanol blended Jet-A fuels show marked reductions in CO2, NOx, and soot formation with increasing blend rates (Eiff et al., 1992). Biomethane was judged unsuitable by Saynor et al. (2003) because of its limited availability and uncertain quality. Nuclear power was deemed too dangerous in case of accidents or terrorist attacks. Thus, synthetic kerosene, biodiesel, and LH2 were examined in Saynor et al.\u2019s (2003) study, which discussed the corresponding production possibilities, costs, environmental considerations in production and transport, and advantages and disadvantages in use. The environmental advantages of these alternative fuels were deemed to be:\u25cfBiodiesel as a partial substitute for kerosene would reduce fuel cycle carbon emissions. Since CO2 is well mixed throughout the atmosphere, emission reductions in the fuel production process have the same benefit as emission reductions over the flight cycle.\u25cfSynthetic kerosene, produced from biomass feedstock via the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process, reduces fuel cycle carbon emissions as well. The fuel is virtually sulphur free, which would almost eliminate emissions of SO2 and SO3, which are precursors of sulphuric acid solution droplets at cruise level-a form of particles that are important in cirrus formation.\u25cfBurning LH2 would eliminate emissions of all carbon bearing species including soot, and sulphur oxides. The only primary combustion products would be H2O and NOx.\n",

The reason is the wider flammability range of the LH2/air mixture compared with the kerosene/air mixture which allows combustion at an equivalence ratio, resulting in a lower flame temperature. Svensson and Singh (2005) discussed various engine cycles for LH2 fuel, and showed that in relative terms, the potential to reduce NOx emissions is greater than the potential to reduce fuel consumption and hence H2O emission. In order to reduce mission NOx emissions, engines with lower core power along with lower bypass ratios could be used. Lower core power means lower temperatures and pressures, such that less NOx is formed. The reduced bypass ratio would limit decreases in fuel consumption.",

So the introduction of a significant cryoplane fleet will certainly be decades in the future. For the short- and mid-term future synthetic kerosene is the easiest to use for aviation, however, the production cost is considerably higher than that of mineral kerosene. Alternative fuels such as LH2 might be useful to alter contrail properties that make them less detrimental to climate; however, for contrail suppression they are not applicable, as stated above.

Aviation kerosene has a demanding specification because of safety requirements. The possibility of using biofuels as \u2018blends\u2019 with either conventional kerosene or synthetic fuels has been examined recently by Daggett et al., 2006, Daggett et al., 2008. These authors note some of the difficulties associated with biofuels for kerosene blends, i.e. its lower freezing temperature at normal cruise conditions, its poorer thermal stability characteristics and storage stability over time. However, none of these difficulties were considered insurmountable. Suitable biofuels would require a large fraction of oil content, such as sunflower, soybeans or rapeseed. Daggett et al. (2006) illustrate that large areas of agricultural land would be required in order to supply demand on this basis, e.g. for a 15% biofuel kerosene blend, citing the US fleet consumption (year unspecified) of 13.6 \u00d7 109 US gallons, which at 15% blend would require 34 million acres of soybean production, approximating to the size of Florida State.

Currently, aviation represents 2.5% of global CO2 emissions (2005), and was 2.7% in 2000.\u25cfThe construction of emission inventories and scenarios has become more refined with the incorporation of non-scheduled air traffic and better estimations of military emissions (although these remain a minor component). Nonetheless, challenges remain in these estimations because of the complexity of the data handling and some issues remain to be resolved. None of the bottom-up emissions inventories yet match the recorded sales of kerosene by the IEA. From IEA data, emissions of CO2 from aviation were 733 Tg in 2005.\u25cfA number of future (2050) scenarios have been constructed which are new since the IPCC (1999) report and utilize SRES-compatible assumptions of growth (GDP). According to these scenarios, CO2 emissions will increase by factors of 2.7\u20133.9 over 2000 levels. These new scenarios generally match the older IPCC (1999) ones well, although the (IPCC and other) low-growth scenarios appear to be less plausible than the mid- to higher growth scenarios.\n",

However, this is not a climate impact issue but one of air quality. The estimated amount of primary NO2 emitted at higher power settings relevant to cruise conditions has not changed since the IPCC (1999) report and remains of the order 1\u201310%.\u25cfEmissions of OH, which control the rate of oxidation of NOx to NOy in the plume and the initial rate of conversion of SIV to SVI\n, are very difficult to measure and have previously been either estimated, or assumed to be of the order 10 ppm at the engine exit. Limited measurements during the PartEmis project indicate levels much lower than this at the engine exit, of the order 1 ppb. This may have implications for plume chemistry estimations and explains other estimations of SIV to SVI conversion if correct (see below).\u25cfGood progress has been made on characterizing non-volatile particle emissions, i.e. soot. These typically have aerodynamic diameters of 30\u201360 nm and are largely spherical and may agglomerate, forming particles of 100 nm. Limited measurements show that the number of ice crystals in a young contrail is a direct function of the number of soot particles emitted. Soot may also interact with sulphate and organic species (see below) and be involved in the later formation of cirrus clouds, (\u2018soot cirrus\u2019).\u25cfKerosene contains small amounts of sulphur (0.064%) which may be converted to SO2 and H2SO4 and is the principle component of volatile particles. Gaseous H2SO4 is potentially an important aerosol precursor in the upper troposphere and it has been measured directly in plume encounters. The fraction of SVI emitted from aircraft exhaust was previously thought to be of the order 10% or greater. Limited measurements and model studies have shown that this is rather lower, of the order 1\u201310%, with the higher values derived from model studies for modern engines with high combustion pressure and temperature. Most of the conversion of SIV to SVI occurs within the engine itself.\u25cfMeasurements and modelling indicate that organic volatile compounds are emitted and can act as particle precursors. The precise nature and composition of these organic species is not yet known but particle measurements cannot be explained without this volatile material being present in the exhaust. Such organic species should be identified.\u25cfGaseous charged ions \u2013 chemi-ions \u2013 may also take part in the particle formation process and both positive and negative charged ions have been detected. It is possible that these ions form initial very small particles of a few nm in diameter.\n",

The specific O3 RF (mW m\u22122/Tg N yr\u22121) for O3 from aviation is approximately 5.5 times greater than that from all NOx sources combined.\u25cfAircraft NOx emissions also result in the destruction of a small fraction of ambient CH4. Ozone formation and CH4 destruction from aircraft NOx results in positive and negative RFs, respectively, with the CH4 response being accompanied by a decadal time-scale loss of O3, but the primary O3 and CH4 responses to NOx emissions occur on different temporal and spatial scales.\u25cfThe global modelling of aircraft emissions and their effect on chemistry and climate has improved greatly since the IPCC (1999) assessment. Models show similar enhancement of O3 and destruction of CH4 from NOx emissions although the magnitude varies. Many models now include NMHC emissions which make a significant contribution to the overall O3 budget: however, aviation has been shown to be an insignificant source of these emissions. It has also been shown that the inclusion of acetone and PAN chemistry is important in modelling aviation impacts.\u25cfThe inclusion of particles and heterogeneous chemistry in models results in an enhanced conversion of NOx to HNO3, which reduces the amount of O3 formed.\u25cfIt has been speculated that the presence of cirrus clouds may reduce the O3 by surface chemistry: this has not been directly investigated in terms of its potential impact on aviation-produced O3 but there are indications that this is a minor effect, of the order 5%.\u25cfAircraft emit particles that have direct radiative effects by scattering (SO4) solar radiation or absorbing (soot) terrestrial radiation.\n",

In fact, the interannual variability in calculated HSCT-induced O3 changes in a global CTM may be of a magnitude comparable to the differences observed between calculations performed by various models within IPCC (1999). This result highlights both the importance of the chosen background meteorological conditions in aircraft assessments and the extent to which differences in meteorology can contribute to differences between model calculations.\u25cf\nJPL chemical updates: Updates of the reaction rate constants and photolysis cross-sections in atmospheric chemical models to the recommendations of JPL 2000 and JPL 2002 (Sander et al., 2000, Sander et al., 2003) increased the calculated O3 dependence on EI-NOx\n, with respect to previous assessments, namely IPCC (1999). In fact, the cross-over point in the O3 chemical production and destruction terms from NOx chemistry is at altitudes of approximately 16 km, somewhat lower than deduced for the IPCC (1999) calculations. If NOx and H2O supersonic emissions take place in the region of O3 chemical destruction, this causes an O3 decrease throughout the stratosphere and therefore in the O3 column. For this reason the potential impact on the atmosphere of a future fleet of supersonic aircraft may be highly dependent upon the amount of NOx emitted from the fleet and the cruise altitude.\u25cf\nPolar stratospheric clouds: Perturbations in HNO3 and H2O, arising from stratospheric supersonic aircraft emissions of NOx and H2O, would have a direct influence on the thermodynamic threshold temperatures for the existence of NAT, STS and ice particles in the Northern Hemisphere polar stratosphere. The \u2018supersonic\u2019 aircraft emission-induced perturbation in the formation of solid type PSC particles may significantly increase the denitrification rate in the Arctic lower stratosphere.\u25cf\nRadiative feedback: The magnitude of the direct climate forcing produced by an HSCT aircraft fleet is such that it is important to consider the effect of the radiative feedbacks when estimating the climatic/dynamic response to such aircraft emission. The globally integrated amount of water vapour in the lower stratosphere would increase due to a TTL warming resulting from the net RF produced by the supersonic aircraft emissions, thus increasing the H2O related RF (positive feedback). This effect may be balanced (or even overbalanced) when taking into account H2O and O3 radiative feedbacks on the stratospheric circulation: the latter would tend to reinforce, thus increasing the pole-to-equator gradient of the HSCT-accumulated H2O in the lower stratosphere. In this case, one study found a reduction of the H2O RF resulting from HSCT emissions (negative feedback). Additional numerical studies are needed to assess this effect.\u25cf\nUV: Using EC-SCENIC emission scenarios of supersonic aircraft in 2050 and O3 and aerosol changes calculated in a global CTM, the resulting calculated changes in erythemal UV with respect to the base (pure subsonic) scenario are generally positive at all latitudes and seasons and small, rarely exceeding 1%.\u25cf\nClimate forcing and sensitivity studies: The quantitative assessment of different options for supersonic transport with regard to the potential destruction of the O3 layer and climate impacts is made analyzing options for fleet size, engine technology (EINOx), cruising altitude, range, and cruising height. Based on EC-SCENIC emissions scenarios for 2050, considering both radiative forcing calculations and environmental options, the minimum impact was found for a supersonic scenario where speed and cruise altitude are reduced with respect to the base case, i.e. about Mach 1.6 and 16 km altitude, instead of Mach 2.0 and 20 km. An analysis of the different RF components in 2050 shows that the net forcing from aerosol particles is the largest component after water vapour.\n",

Contrails are initially linear and may result in an increase of cirrus cloud cover if they are persistent, depending upon the traffic density, and cause a local and global change in RF. The warming effect of persistent linear contrails exceeds the solar albedo (cooling) effect. The occurrence of contrails may be predicted with good accuracy. However, contrail coverage is still poorly quantified since the calculations of coverage involve normalization to observations by satellites, which do not \u2018see\u2019 contrails below a certain optical depth. Unfortunately, this normalization factor does not seem to be equal in all areas of the globe. Estimates of contrail RF indicate smaller values than the IPCC presented but this is largely a function of optical depth which has been reduced from 0.3 to 0.2, or less. Although some recent models compute the optical depth from the available IWC in contrails, it is prescribed in others. The values of optical depth in contrails are not well known and represent a significant uncertainty.\u25cfContrails may spread into non-linear structures that closely resemble cirrus clouds (contrail-cirrus). Progress has been made in quantifying the extent of contrail-cirrus but this has been from observations and a correlation between air traffic and increases in cirrus cloud coverage over e.g. timescales of more than 5 yr. Thus, a causal relationship cannot be established but a number of independent studies (that sometimes use the same underlying data) have indicated that there is an increase in cirrus cloud coverage in regions of heavy air traffic. However, recently, the usage of ISSCP data for long-term trend studies has been called into question, and if the data are corrected, studies on long-term trends in cirrus attributable to aviation should be repeated. The radiative properties of contrail cirrus are very poorly quantified but are currently considered to be similar to those of persistent linear contrails: these properties need to be confirmed.\u25cfModelling studies have been initiated that attempt to quantify the occurrence of soot-cirrus, which have utilized recent measurements and parameterizations of ice formation on particles. Cirrus cloud formation is believed to be dominated by homogeneous freezing of supercooled liquid droplets. However, heterogeneous ice nucleation may also occur, e.g. from aviation soot in the UT/LS and there is evidence of this from field campaigns and measurements comparing \u2018clean\u2019 cirrus with \u2018polluted\u2019 cirrus. The results from one modelling study were unequivocal in that both warming effects and cooling effects may theoretically occur but the \u2018real\u2019 occurrence is simply unknown. There is a lack of fundamental understanding over the mechanisms that are in operation in the atmosphere. Two physically-based ice-nucleation parameterizations have been developed and implemented into a global model. The two parameterizations provide good agreement with each other in terms of ice crystal number concentration. However, similarly to a previous study, the results may produce either positive or negative RFs (10\u201380 mW m\u22122 and \u2212140 to \u2212160 mW m\u22122), depending upon the effects of aerosol concentrations on ice number concentration and size. A later study estimated the effect of aircraft soot on cirrus clouds to be in the range of \u2212110 to +260 mW m\u22122. Clearly, this is an aspect which requires much more work on both understanding the fundamental mechanisms and the implications for global mean RF.\n",

This is an acceptable and robust metric that quantifies the radiative effects of aviation to date, or under some particular emissions scenario, but underestimates the full consequences of historical emissions. It has been used in climate science in general because of the linear relationship between global mean RF and global mean surface temperature response.\u25cfThere is some recent evidence that different forcings may result in different temperature responses, when compared with the temperature response from CO2 forcing. The ratio of these two sensitivities has been termed the \u2018efficacy\u2019. Limited work on aviation forcings has indicated that there are significant deviations from unity in efficacy, both positive and negative.\u25cfSince aviation results in both positive and negative RFs, it is important to understand the implications of this. These are usually quantified in terms of global mean RFs but the localized forcings may have different spatial patterns from one another, e.g. positive O3 and negative CH4 forcings. It has been found in some idealized GCM integrations that the global mean temperature response to the same O3 forcing varies by latitude and altitude. More generally, some GCM experiments have shown that the pattern of temperature response to either homogeneous or heterogeneous forcing is dissimilar to the forcing and depends primarily on local feedbacks. However, forcings in these areas where local feedbacks operate may amplify the temperature response. The issue of quantification of the effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous aviation-induced forcings is an important area of work which requires further work. Such complex responses highlight the limitations of simple climate models to represent aviation forcings adequately in terms of global mean temperature response.\u25cfEmission-based metrics such as the GWP and GTP have been reviewed and formulated into CO2-equivalent emissions. The value of these depends on the time-horizon selected. Emissions weighting factors that represent the total effect of aviation as a ratio to that of CO2 have been calculated and presented for GWPs and GTP metrics and different time-horizons. For GWPs, these range from 4.3 to 4.8 (GWP20) and 1.9\u20132.0 (GWP100) for 2005, including AIC; excluding AIC they are 2.1\u20132.6 (GWP20) and 1.3\u20131.4 (GWP100). In the context of these calculations, AIC has a similar uncertainty to aviation NOx GWPs, given that the few different estimates change in sign.\n",

This assessment has not considered policy options (e.g. market based options or regulatory regimes) but rather some technological and operational possibilities.\u25cfAmbitious technology targets for fuel burn and NOx emissions have been formulated in Europe, the US and at the international level through such bodies as ACARE, The US National Science and Technology Council, and ICAO. It is generally accepted that these targets will require technological breakthroughs and innovation: nonetheless, if achieved, market uptake is relatively slow because of the long lifetime of aircraft. Also, such targets need to be considered in terms of rate of growth when quantifying the effects of such improvements on aviation's impacts on climate change. Little work has yet been undertaken on assessing the impacts of such technology targets on global fleet emissions and their climate impacts (there are also potential technological tradeoffs with noise and emissions in the context of local air quality impacts). The climate impact tradeoffs are also complex, and have been considered in the companion assessment on transport-related climate metrics (Fuglestvedt et al., 2009).\u25cfThe formation of contrails is largely a function of environmental conditions, such that technological measures may change the contrail composition and properties but not the formation conditions. The only technological options that would lead to a reduction in contrail formation would require reductions in the emission index of H2O, or an increase in the specific heat content of the fuel (Q), or a decrease in the overall propulsion efficiency. This latter prospect would be highly undesirable for a fuel efficiency point of view and invoke complex comparisons between short-term and long term climate responses from contrails and CO2. Using either CH4 or LH2 as alternative fuels would result in contrails being formed at higher ambient temperatures than kerosene-powered aircraft and therefore increase the depth of the atmosphere over which contrails might be produced. Fuel additives are not a viable option.\u25cfThe main suggestion for reducing contrail formation has been operational avoidance. This has been shown in modelling studies to be quite effective, and would require avoidance of ice-supersaturated air. However, more work needs to be done on the feasibility (and cost) of implementation of this into the air traffic management system and the potential fuel penalties. Again, this invokes the complexity of assessing the impact of reducing a short-term climate impact against increasing a longer-term impact.\u25cfEmissions of NOx can be reduced by technological means by manipulation of the combustor conditions or the cooling air. There may be potential technological tradeoffs that impact upon fuel consumption, and potentially noise. The impact of NOx on O3 formation has been shown to be altitude dependent, along with the RF effect of the O3 produced. Varying cruise altitudes can also change the NOx impacts on O3 formation. However, there is the complexity that O3 production varies according to background conditions which may change in the future.\u25cfAlternative fuels have been considered, mostly in terms of LH2. Such \u2018cryoplanes\u2019 would result in reduced direct CO2 emissions but the fuel production process would also have to be considered. Potentially, NOx emissions from cryoplanes might also be reduced. However, it is only likely that such a fleet would be developed under a more general hydrogen economy. Biofuels have also been considered to a limited extent. Anything that reduces the release of \u2018locked carbon\u2019 from fossil fuels potentially reduces the CO2 impact but there are other issues to be considered beyond the scope of this assessment that include; safety (in terms of kerosene specifications for aviation usage), carbon-budget and other GHG issues, and more general land-use issues (including ethical issues) over potential supply. Usage of biofuels in other sectors may yield more benefits than utilization in the transport sector.\n",
