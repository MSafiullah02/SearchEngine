On the other hand, these very same patients are challenged with the potential risk that ICI therapy may exacerbate the clinical course of their COVID-19 infection and/or that COVID-19 infection may worsen ICI-related side effects. In this composite and potentially cross-interfering scenario, sharing with the oncology community initial observations, even on a limited number of cases, may support treating physicians in their daily practice. On March 6, an asymptomatic, 74-years-old male, ECOG PS0, who was diagnosed with a metastatic cutaneous melanoma on November 2015 (Patient 1), accessed our outpatient clinic with normal clinical and bio-humoral parameters to receive his 83 th cycle of an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), being in partial objective response since June 2016. Worth mentioning, he had undergone right nephrectomy for a pT1N0M0 renal cell carcinoma on February 2016, and on October 2019 he had received a gastric wedge resection for a low risk GIST. On March 16, the patient was admitted to the emergency room at a different Hospital with a 4 days history of fever >38.0\u00baC, mild dyspnea and cough, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Routine nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the patient was therefore hospitalized (Figure 1). Computed Tomography (CT) scans revealed a bilateral pneumonitis, and laboratory tests were compatible with COVID-19 infection (Figure 1). 4,5 The local protocol for COVID-19 infection was activated and the patient was treated with oral azythromicyne, darunavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and oxygen therapy. On March 24, lymphocyte count reached the nadir (i.e., 650 \u00d710 -9 U/L), and on April 2 the patient was discharged being asymptomatic, with normal blood values, and with two subsequent swabs testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1). Being cured from COVID-19 infection ICI therapy will be reactivated. On March 18, an asymptomatic, 51-years-old female, ECOG PS0, receiving adjuvant therapy for a locally advanced cutaneous melanoma surgically removed on July 2019 (Patient 2), was admitted to our outpatient clinic with normal clinical and bio-humoral parameters to receive her 11 th cycle of an anti-PD-1 mAb. Noteworthy, being the patient an MD, she had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 11 following a professional exposure to COVID-19. On March 19, the patient called our clinic referring asthenia, nausea, fever >38.0\u00baC, headache, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Due to the persistence of the clinical symptoms, on March 25 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were performed, confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1). Due to the mildness of referred symptoms, and according to the local protocol, the patient did not receive treatment for COVID-19 infection, and was quarantined at home. On March 30, she referred improvement of clinical symptoms, while bio-humoral parameters normalized on April 3 (",
