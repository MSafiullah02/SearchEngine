The terminal phosphate is removed and GMP (guanosine monophosphate) is added to create the guanosine cap intermediate (G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)N). This structure has a 5\u2032 to 5\u2032 triphosphate linkage thought to be unique to RNA pol II transcripts. Subsequently the guanosine cap is methylated on the 7\u2032\u2010N position and the first and second transcribed nucleotides can be methylated on the ribose 2\u2032\u2010O positions. More rare modifications are found in the cap structure including 6\u2032\u2010N methylation if the first transcribed nucleotide is adenosine.3, 4 6\u2032\u2010N methylation of the first nucleotide adenosine is reversible and increases transcript stability by conferring resistance to decapping enzymes. Furthermore, any other RNA modification, including 1\u2032\u2010N adenosine methylation, may be found on the first transcribed nucleotides, thus becoming part of a cap structure.5 Recently novel nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) caps have also been isolated on mRNA, which target the transcripts for degradation.6\n",

The catalytic cores of the different capping enzymes are largely conserved in eukaryotes whereas the holo\u2010enzymes have different configurations. In this review, we focus discussion on the mammalian capping enzymes. In mammals, a single enzyme, RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5\u2032 triphosphatase) possess both triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities.7, 8 Guanosine cap 7\u2032\u2010N methylation, creating m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)N, is catalyzed by RNMT (RNA guanine\u20107 methyltransferase), which is found in a complex with its activating subunit RAM (RNMT\u2010activating miniprotein).9, 10, 11 Methylation of the first and second transcribed nucleotides at the ribose 2\u2032\u2010O position is catalyzed by CMTR1 and CMTR2, respectively.12, 13 While analyses are in agreement that m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)Nm is the most abundant mRNA cap structure, the relative proportion of the different cap methyl groups is an area of active research.6, 14, 15 Previously, mass spectrometric analyses of cap structures were restricted to cell lines and large organs.

However, 2\u2032\u2010O methylation is present on the first nucleotide of U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs and is important for their function in the mechanism of splicing.25 snRNAs are RNA pol II transcripts and therefore receive a 7\u2010methylguanosine cap. Following export into the cytoplasm, further methylation yields a (2,2,7) trimethylguanosine cap and the snRNA\u2013protein complex (snRNP) is re\u2010imported into the nucleus to function in splicing. In the nucleus, the snRNAs are further modified with pseudouridination, and first and internal nucleotide ribose 2\u2032\u2010O methylation. In vitro\u2010transcribed U2 snRNA cannot reconstitute splicing in U2\u2010depleted Xenopus oocytes or HeLa nuclear extract indicating that modifications of U2 snRNA are important for snRNP biogenesis and/or pre\u2010mRNA splicing.26, 27 Only when both the (2,2,7) trimethylguanosine cap and internal modifications are acquired does synthetic U2 snRNA become fully functional.28 Moreover, 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 12, and 19, but not at position 11, are individually required for the function of U2 snRNA.

In vitro, CMTR1 catalyses methylation of ribose 2\u2032\u2010OH group on the first transcribed nucleotide of guanosine\u2010capped RNA. Although CMTR1 requires a cap guanosine structure (GpppN) in its substrates, it acts independently of N\u20107 methylation.12, 37 CMTR1 is also unable to methylate internal residues. Extracts of HeLa cells depleted of CMTR1 are defective for first nucleotide 2\u2032\u2010O methylation, indicating that there is not a completely redundant methyltransferase present in these cells.12 Belanger et al. also reported that knock\u2010down of CMTR1 does not impact on global translation as measured by 35S methionine incorporation, although it is a possibility that the remaining CMTR1 may be sufficient to maintain translation. As discussed above, first nucleotide 2\u2032\u2010O methylation has been linked to mRNA translation in several eukaryotic systems and deletion of the first and second transcribed nucleotide 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase in Trypanosomes results in a significant reduction in global translation.39\n",

RIG\u2010I (Retinoic Acid Inducible Gene\u2010I), an innate immune receptor, is a cytoplasmic protein which detects triphosphate RNA (pppRNA) and induces cellular signaling responses that ultimately drive to an interferon response. The impact of individual cap modifications, including cap guanosine 7\u2032\u2010N methylation and first nucleotide 2\u2032\u2010O methylation, on RIG\u2010I activation was analyzed using synthetic RNA.24, 46 First nucleotide 2\u2032\u2010O methylation was found to prevent RIG\u2010I activation, in a mechanism utilizing a highly conserved histidine residue (H830). In cells, experimental interference with this \u2018key\u2010lock\u2019 mechanism elicits an interferon response similar to that triggered by viral infection. The RIG\u2010I H830A mutation results in stimulation of RIG\u2010I by endogenous mRNA.
