However, the data collected in this research shows no substantial difference in sexual activity between before and during the lockdown; most of the participants engage in sexual activity with their partner once to five times a week before and during lockdown (76% and 72% respectively), while the data show that after the lockdown, more participants engaged in sexual activity with their partner more than 5 times a week, in comparison to before the lockdown (10% and 6.7% respectively), meaning that around 3.3% of the participants' sexual activity increased from 1 to 5 times a week to more than five times, the increase of sexual habits can be due to seeking intimacy and reassurance, or simply having more time to spend with their partner. This to say that more participants' sexual habits might have been affected by the lockdown but the effect is not major as their sexual habits still fall under 1 to 5 times a week. One study revealed that among couples in a relationship who have a sexual activity frequency of once a week and couples who have a higher frequency, there is no association between the frequency of sexual activity and well-being and satisfaction with life (Muise et al., 2016) . This could explain the finding that 46.7% of the sample reported no change in their emotional bonding.",

There is a paucity of literature regarding changes in sexual behavior during lockdown states as seen during the current pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly and the lockdown state is getting prolonged, understanding the changing pattern of sexual behavior may give some insight to the pathological behavior, so that possible remediation measures can be taken. Therefore, the current study was aimed to see how sexual behaviors have been changed among the married couples during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted among the individuals of three south-east Asian countries (Bangladesh, India & Nepal) from 3 rd April 2020 to15 th April 2020. The research was carried out using an online survey, for which a questionnaire was created in English using the Google form. A convenient sampling technique was applied, and the individuals who understood English were approached. The questionnaire link was forwarded to all investigators' associates and the respondents were asked to forward or post the links among their contact groups. Clicking on the questionnaire link, circulated during the survey flashed a brief summary of the survey on the screen, followed by the consent form. Participants aged 18 years and above, married and living with their spouses during the lockdown, consenting to participate in the study and able to understand English were included in the study. The questionnaire became accessible after accepting the terms and conditions of the study. Data cleaning was done by one of the investigators and it was cross-checked by a second investigator. Data analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS version 26. A total of 120 responses were analyzed from the respondents of the three South-East Asian countries (Bangladesh, India & Nepal). The background characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. The mean (\u00b1SD) age of the respondents was 35.42 Respondent's sexual activity-related statistics are presented in Table 2. Almost 76.7% of respondents shared that they had sexual intercourse with their spouse 1 to 5 times a week before the start of lockdown. 45% of the respondents reported that the lockdown had some impact in their sexual life. After the start of lockdown 72.5% of the respondents reported of having sexual intercourse 1 to 5 times a week. 50% of respondents reported having positive changes in their emotional bonding due to the lockdown. Table 1. Distribution of respondents by their background characteristics (n=120) Sexual intercourse per week in usual time (i.e. before lockdown) The current study was aimed to see the effects lockdown of COVID-19 on the sexual life of the individuals from three south-east Asian countries. The participants of this study have either graduate or postgraduate education and employed, which is expected as most of online or web survey respondents are younger with high education and most likely employed than those who refuse to participate in the survey",
