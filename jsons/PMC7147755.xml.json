Evidence for the presence of multiple viruses in these settings, including influenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, norovirus and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been reviewed [3]. Infections acquired in hospital settings are a major concern for patients, workers and visitors. They are responsible for longer hospital stays [4], increased costs [4\u20138], absenteeism among healthcare workers [4], and even patient deaths [9]. Norovirus, influenza, rotavirus and RSV are among the most common viruses acquired in hospital settings [10, 11]. On various occasions, cruise ships have been struck by norovirus outbreaks, infecting hundreds of people at once [12\u201318]. As mentioned by Lopman et al. (2012) [1], norovirus has also been problematic in other indoor environments, including restaurants, schools and kindergartens, concert halls, airplanes and buses.",

Large aerosol droplets usually travel shorter distances, generally a few dozen centimetres [19, 20]. Aerosols of smaller size can habitually remain in the air for longer time periods and consequently can travel over long distances (more than 1 m) [3, 19\u201321]. Bioaerosols can also settle after a prolonged time period, leading to fomite contamination [22]. A second aerosolization from these contaminated fomites is also possible and may cause further propagation of pathogens [3, 23].",

Surface disinfection protocols are already in place in hospitals, airplanes, schools and daycare facilities. It is well documented that a sodium hypochlorite solution (bleach) is an effective way to inactivate norovirus [29\u201331], while alcohol-, detergent- and quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectants have more limited effects [27, 29, 32\u201334]. Since sodium hypochlorite is corrosive and an irritant to mucous membranes, skin and airways [35], it is usually employed only for specific tasks or during outbreaks [36]. As for disinfection time, Tuladhar et al. (2012) [37] suggest that sodium hypochlorite should be in contact with surfaces for 5 min for reducing norovirus, while the World Health Organization recommends a contact time of at least 10 min for this disinfectant, regardless of the pathogen [35]. Even if the recommendations differ, these contact times are often difficult to achieve because of the workload and availability of environmental hygiene personnel. The personal protective equipment (PPE) that is recommended during viral outbreaks includes disposable gowns, gloves, respirators and even eye protection [31] when working in hospitals, though they are rarely worn in other indoor public spaces. Unfortunately, the efficacy of interventions for reducing the transmission and inhibiting the development of infections has not yet been established [10, 30, 33, 38].",

Such treatments could be used in the heating and ventilation plenums to inactivate viruses. However, since some hospital rooms are not mechanically ventilated, another strategy could be the implementation of an air treatment during times of no occupancy, when hospital rooms are vacant.",

As mentioned by Hudson et al. (2007) [48], the gas state allows ozone to get to areas that are difficult to reach and to disinfect much more than just surfaces. The Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentration (IDLH) of ozone is 5 ppm for humans. In order to protect the health of occupants, and keeping in mind that leakage from the closed hospital rooms can occur, it is crucial that the concentration used for air treatment be below this value. In the literature, ozone concentrations between 6.25 ppm and 60,000 ppm have been used [47\u201351] for inactivating norovirus surrogates on surfaces or food, which are all above the IDLH. Three studies used concentrations below the IDHL, with exposure times of 2 min or less [52\u201354]. Our study was designed to use lower ozone concentrations but for longer exposure periods in order to treat the air in unoccupied and unsealed rooms [55, 56].",

It is important to use multiple phages with different features (e.g. with and without an envelope, RNA and DNA, single and double-stranded) to represent a broader range of eukaryotic viruses and their resistance when airborne and when exposed to disinfecting agents. For this reason, four model phages were selected: MS2, \u03c66, PR772 and \u03c6X174. MS2 is a widely recognized model for norovirus [59, 60]. Because of its envelope, \u03c66 is considered to be a good surrogate for Influenza. PR772 is a good model for the human adenovirus [61]. Lastly, \u03c6X174 was selected for its genetic material (single-stranded DNA phage) and ease of use. In addition to the phages, a eukaryotic virus, MNV-1, was selected. MNV-1 is a murine surrogate for human norovirus, the latter cannot be cultivated in vitro [34]. Its characteristics and behaviour are similar to the human norovirus and it can be replicated in cell culture, making MNV-1 the most widely accepted surrogate [34, 62, 63].",

When ozone reacts with water, it forms free radicals that can increase disinfection power: the superoxide anion (\u00b7O2-), the hydroxyperoxyl radical (HO2\u00b7) and the hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) [46]. Our hypothesis, supported by Hudson et al. (2007) [48] and Li and Wang\u2019s (2003) [64] work, is that more free radicals will be formed when air humidity is higher, which could lead to higher virus inactivation. Three exposure times (10, 40 and 70 minutes) were also selected to verify whether virus infectivity decreases over time.",

For better protection, ozone destructors can be used and operated in the hallway near the closed door of the hospital rooms and inside them when the treatment is completed. Treating the air directly in the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) plenum with the help of ozone destructors is also of interest. The recycled air would be clean and ozone-free, allowing people to stay inside the treated rooms during continuous air treatment. Higher ozone concentrations could also be used in HVAC plenum, resulting in faster inactivation of airborne viruses. The main drawback of this installation is that, contrary to the in situ air disinfection protocol, surfaces would not benefit from additional decontamination. Based on the constraints associated with the type of ventilation, a decision must be made about whether one or a combination of both methods best fits the available infrastructure.

An exposure of 40 minutes at 85% RH yields the inactivation of at least two orders of magnitude for \u03c6X174, MS2 and MNV-1. An exposure to the reference conditions at 20% RH for 10 minutes for PR772 and \u03c66 was enough to yield the same results. The inactivation of other problematic viruses should be tested to obtain supplementary evidence regarding this air treatment and with the eventual possibility of implementing it in hospital settings. Since Influenza is an enveloped virus, it would be interesting to evaluate if the treatment efficacy is the same as its surrogate phage, \u03c66. In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, future work is needed to assess the efficacy of an ozone treatment in order to reduce the transmission of this virus in hospital settings and other indoor public spaces. This treatment could also be tested with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, including Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, which are serious threats to hospitalized patients. Lastly, low ozone concentrations could be used for air treatment inside hospital rooms ventilated naturally, providing an additional tool for hospitals that do not possess HVAC plenums.",
