            "text": "There are many reasons why an arsenal of therapies for severe viral infections, including those caused by highly pathogenic RNA viruses, does not exist. The primary reason applies to the development of safe and effective treatments for any infections caused by viruses. Since viruses can be described as obligate intracellular parasites that subvert cellular metabolic and reproductive processes for their own persistence and replication, the difficulty in identifying a drug target that would derail viral replication without causing concurrent host toxicity is easily appreciated. In fact the idea that the identification of a safe and effective antiviral drug was by definition impossible, was scientific dogma for many years. This mistaken ideology was first brought into question by the discovery and development of amantadine for influenza and acyclovir as a treatment for herpes simplex. It was finally laid to rest with the emergence of HIV and the AIDS epidemic, and the astonishingly rapid accomplishment of the development of 25 drugs against five separate HIV viral targets. However the question remains as to why similar successes have not been enjoyed for the other RNA viruses that cause highly pathogenic infections.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, many of the reasons are as clear as they are difficult to solve. First, many of these viruses are endemic or emerge sporadically in parts of the world with inadequate public health resources. These circumstances usually correlate with a lack of economic incentive for the pharmaceutical industry. Secondly, many of the diseases they cause are rare which complicates the clinical evaluation of potential therapies. Most importantly, many of these infections cause high morbidity and/or mortality and therefore research on them requires access to high-level biological containment. Finally, the host response to infection may make a significant contribution to the pathology such that an antiviral monotherapy may not be sufficient for disease control.",

Although exceptions are occasionally made, the chemical identity or characterization of compounds to be screened must be released to the NIAID staff manager who will keep this information confidential. This is necessary so that the same compounds are not screened repeatedly. All of the assays are replication based. The assays for influenza and SARS are also available in a high throughput format.

The models currently include mouse and/or hamster models of biodefense-related viruses such as Punta Toro, Pichinde, yellow fever, West Nile, influenza A (including avian H5N1), and Venezuelan and Western equine encephalitis viruses. Some of the biodefense-related viral models serve as surrogates for their more hazardous counterparts such as Punta Toro as a surrogate for Rift Valley fever and Pichinde as a surrogate for Lassa fever. The program also includes less exotic pathogens such as mouse models of herpesviruses, mouse or rabbit models of papillomavirus, cotton rat models of paramyxoviruses, and mouse models of orthopoxviruses. In addition, the program offers a transgenic mouse model of hamster-scrapie (see detailed descriptions of the models on the website referenced below). The NIAID contract laboratories are staffed by established investigators who possess a strong antiviral research background and publication record in their respective animal models. Often there are several different models available for an individual pathogen and these may vary in method of virus inoculation or animal mortality. It is also often possible to evaluate different methods of drug delivery when appropriate such as intraperitoneal, topical, oral or intravenous as well as a range of doses and regimens. The first experiment in a series is usually designed to give the drug every advantage to show efficacy so the candidate therapy may be administered at the same time as the virus is inoculated or even before. Endpoints can include clinical parameters such as mortality, weight and oxygen saturation, and laboratory values such as virus titers in various organs. Therapeutic combinations can also be evaluated in these models. Table 1\nlists a selection of currently available models. Antiviral evaluations for filoviruses are not currently offered but may be done in collaboration with the Department of Defense or some academic investigators.",

Criteria for prioritization include addressing an unmet medical need, having novel chemical or desirable pharmacokinetic characteristics, utilizing a novel therapeutic strategy and having pharmaceutical backing for further development. Often, the materials submitted to the in vivo testing program are those that were \u201chits\u201d in the in vitro screening process. Exceptions to this include products that are anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory in nature. Such products would not be expected to manifest antiviral activity in vitro, so these products are considered by the NIAID for direct submission to the animal model program. After a product has been selected for testing, the compound sponsor, the NIAID contractor, and NIAID program staff work together to develop specific protocols to evaluate the product. The experiments are conducted in a stepwise fashion with continual involvement of the three parties. Rarely, a sponsor does not want to be involved in planning for each specific study. In those cases, NIAID staff and the animal model contractor will develop the plan and then discuss the results with the sponsor.",

There are, however, more sophisticated toxicology studies also available, such as genotoxicity, reproductive toxicology and other studies that may entail specialized capabilities. Investigators may benefit from the synthesis of their candidate drugs and drug analogs in quantities sufficient for subsequent biological and biochemical analyses, and this can include radiolabeled compounds. Additionally, investigators that have a structural lead series of compounds that have exhibited efficacy may use these contracts to pursue lead optimization and development services.

However, there is a time-window that limits the therapeutic efficacy of hE16 in this model (Morrey et al., 2007). Further work under this collaboration established that WNV can undergo retrograde axonal transport, and that hE16 can prevent paralysis when administered 1 day after intra-sciatic nerve injection (Samuel et al., 2007).",

In the contract laboratory at Utah State University, the principle investigator at that time, Dr. Robert Sidwell and colleagues discovered for the first time that T-705 was highly active in mice lethally infected with influenza A/Duck/MN/1525/81 (H5N1) (Sidwell et al., 2007). When administered per os 1-h post-virus exposure, once, twice, or four times daily, dosages from 30 to 300 mg/kg/day were well tolerated; each prevented death, lessened decline of arterial oxygen saturation and inhibited lung consolidation and lung virus titers. The four times per day treatments at 300 mg/kg/day were also found to be efficacious when treatment was delayed 96 h after virus exposure. Remarkably, single T-705 treatments administered up to 60 h after virus exposure prevented deaths and arterial oxygen saturation decline. Altogether, over 10 experiments were conducted for the Toyama Chemical Company on T-705 versus influenza in the mouse model. The preclinical efficacy data from these experiments were used to support Toyama's IND submissions in both Japan and the United States. Safety evaluations in humans began in Japan in January 2007, and in the U.S. shortly thereafter. The NIAID is continuing to support the investigation of T-705 in combination with other antivirals and in combination with substances which may have an effect on immune modulation or inflammation. In addition, recent work under the NIAID contract with Utah State University has shown that T-705 has activity in rodent models against viruses other than influenza, suggesting it may have broad-spectrum activity against a range of pathogenic RNA viruses (Gowen et al., 2007).",

The most relevant of the current programs are described here. However, some of the programs are new and all are constantly re-evaluated with additions and deletions made as deemed appropriate. Therefore the best course of action to address a developmental need for a therapy for severe viral infections, as well as for any infectious pathogen, is to contact an NIAID program person and discuss how the resources that are available might best be applied to the specific developmental challenge.",
