Increased lethality in men was evident in the first large reports from ChinaCDC and WHO-China, and the gender gap appeared even wider in the early Italian outbreak. Newspapers and scientific journals alike have commented on this finding and the preexisting conditions, biological processes, and gender role behavior differences that may underlie it. However, as for other diseases, and in spite of years of advocating for the collection of raw epidemiological data and the analysis of clinical trial data sets by sex, very little appeared to be released about sex differences in characteristics of the epidemics beyond infection and death rates, such as severity of disease, comorbidities, rate of recovery, length of hospital stay, or number of tests for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These data are critical not only for scientists to understand the pathophysiology of disease, but also to inform decision-making by countries and healthcare systems on how to prioritize testing and best allocate scarce resources and relief funds.",

Only a handful of the countries reported cases by sex separately. None of the other characteristics, including fatality rates, were stratified by sex at the time. Beyond suboptimal sex disaggregation, our analysis found a paucity of usable raw data sets and a generalized lack of standardization of captured data, making comparisons difficult. A second round of data capture in April found more complete, but even more disparate, information.",

The first, published by the China Center for Disease Control (CCDC) on February 17, 2020 1 included 72,314 individuals suspected of being infected, of which 44,672 (61.8%) were confirmed by laboratory testing. Among those, it reported a (male-to-female) sex ratio among cases of 1.06:1 (with slight geographical variation, 0.99:1 in Wuhan and 1.04:1 in Hubei). The second report, published less than 2 weeks later by the World Health Organization (WHO)-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 2 , confirmed that roughly an equal number of men and women were infected in this population (51.1% of 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases were men). Both studies also calculated a case fatality (or lethality) rate, and found a large sexual dimorphism. The earlier study found that 2.8% of infected men vs. 1.7% of women had died. The later report had higher lethality rates but a similar ratio (crude fatality rate was 4.7% in men vs. 2.8% in women). For a roughly similar infection rate, the distribution of lethal cases was almost 2/3 of males and 1/3 females, meaning twice as many men died of the disease than women.",

Possible explanations for the sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection have been extensively discussed elsewhere [6] [7] [8] and include sexual dimorphism in immune response to infection, incidence of comorbidities and risk factors, such as chronic lung disease, and the gender-role behaviors that may underlie those, such as smoking.",

Inclusion of women in NIH-sponsored clinical trials has been required since 1993 and, since 2015, NIH policies requires consideration of the concept of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in the design, analysis, and reporting of studies 15 . Guidelines to design such studies have been published (e.g. 16 ). However, while researchers are now routinely reporting sex ratios in their cohorts, the full potential of analyzing sex-disaggregated data to uncover potential sexual dimorphisms has yet to be realized. For instance, the first COVID-19 randomized clinical trial, reported that lopinavir-rotonavir, an antiviral combination used in the treatment of HIV infection, was not effective against SARS-CoV-2 17 . A similar number of men and women were included in the trial, but drug efficacy was not analyzed by sex. Similarly, a report demonstrating that heart damage is in independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 infection did not analyze data with sex as a biological variable 18 . A similar number of men and women (50.7%) were included in the final report of 416 consecutive cases, but a larger proportion of women had been excluded (57% of 229) because critical laboratory results were not available for them. This seems a missed opportunity given the well-known sex differences in the burden of cardiovascular disease (e.g. 19 ).",

To account for the extreme fluidity of the situation, we accessed official websites at the transnational, governmental, and US State levels in on two occasions within the span of approximately 3 weeks, between March 21-24 and April 5-10, 2020. Available sex data for cases and deaths were scarce in the first data capture, and more generalized in the later one. We found extreme diversity in the type of data captured, graphs chosen to illustrate them, and ease of accessibility of released information. This diversity made it very difficult to compare data from country to country and to derive conclusive lessons from the data currently available. The abundance of nonstandardized information illustrates both the nimbleness of digital systems to support responsiveness to a new pandemic and the lack of preparedness of governmental health authorities worldwide for such an event.",

A similar trend, with a lower sex ratio divergence, was seen among hospital admissions, where women represented 41-45%. Two countries provided numbers of cases and deaths on the same cohorts: Canada among severe hospitalized cases, and France among ICU cases. For these we calculated lethality for each sex (Table 4, in red). In striking contrast to lethality in the infected population at large, we found similar (19.5% in Canada) or even slightly higher lethality in women than men (France, 9.3% vs. 8.1%) among those severe cases.

It is possible that more accurate statistics were obtained with increasing cohort size or that higher lethality in men started reducing the sex ratio of cases as the epidemic progressed. It is also possible that expansion of testing availability resulted in milder cases, or cases with different presentation, becoming counted in women. It could also be a true increase in female rate of infection over time, possibly due to evolution of exposure type and different societal gender roles. For example, in societies where a smaller fraction of women work outside of the home, infection of women may become more widespread in a second wave after infected men have brought the disease back to their communities and their caretakers. Granular sex-disaggregated data about likely method of transmission or disease symptoms will be necessary to test these hypotheses.",

Additionally, if women are offered testing at a lower rate, they may be dying as well, but not be included in the counts because they have not been formally diagnosed. If the presentation of the disease is different in men and women, the criteria for testing, established on the earlier, male-biased statistics, may be inadequate to identify the infected female population. There may also be regional, cultural, and infrastructural specificities resulting in differential reporting of outcomes for men and women.

Both the US CDC and Spanish data suggest that the severe lung disease and pneumonia is a feature more frequently associated with COVID-19 in men. The Spanish data also indicate that other symptoms may have a sexually dimorphic prevalence, with diarrhea, vomiting or sore throat being part of the clinical symptoms more frequently observed in women. This suggests that the extent of infection in women may not have been fully recognized because presentation may be different.

We found one preprint in which the authors designed in silico experiments in search of a possible mechanistic explanation for the sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection 36 . Using publicly available human tissue gene expression and ChIP-Seq data sets, they proposed an intriguing hypothesis where the androgen receptor, AR could directly control the expression of ACE2, one of the two main proteins for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells (the other, TMPRSS2 is a known androgen-responsive gene 37 ). Their analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing found that more pulmonary alveolar type II cells express ACE2 in men than women and that ACE2 is expressed in the prostate and in Sertoli and Leydig cells of the testis, possibly providing another entry path for the virus in men. Expression of AR and ACE2 correlated positively in all tissue types and ChIP-Seq datasets identified a putative ARbinding site upstream of the ACE gene. If these in silico explorations withstand the rigors of peer-review and of in vitro or in vivo experiments, it may mean that aspects of COVID-19 pathology will be susceptible to anti-androgen therapy (as is used routinely in prostate cancer).",

Longitudinal comparison in Portugal shows an increase in the percentage of women among cases. In the same time period proportions have been roughly unchanged in South Korea (with ~60% women), although the change of color convention of this statista.com graph is misleading. Sex ratios are inverse in Italy (52.9% men) and Switzerland (53% women), while equal numbers of affected men and women were reported in Austria. (Text in English in appropriate color was overlaid over the screen shot when needed for increased legibility). Date of data is indicated. Fig. 2 : Wide disparity of data display and age binning for COVID-19 cases disaggregated by sex and age. Screen captures of data disaggregated by both sex and age were found for 9 of the 20 countries (Denmark is shown in Fig. 2 ) and Europe. 'Men' and 'women' labels have been added to the screenshots, in the appropriate colors, when not in English. Blue arrows on the Spain graph were added to indicate features (see description in text). Age-binning, reported metric, and type of graphic representation was different for all. Proportion of men by age, binned in 10-year increments, is shown. Data for Denmark are graphed at 2 stages of the epidemics: Mar. 22, when it was the only such data available (dark blue line), and Apr. 9 (medium blue bars), when the sex ratio at all ages mirrored trends in the other countries captured at a similar time. The average percentage of men across all age groups for each country is shown in the inset table. All data, data source, and calculations are shown in Supplemental Table S1 .
