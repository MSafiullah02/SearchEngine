The global pig industry produced approximately 963 million pigs and 109 million metric tons of pork in 2011 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). Infectious diseases such as foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease (FMD), classical swine fever (CSF) and African swine fever (ASF) are highly contagious viral diseases reportable to the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) that can have a severe economic impact on affected areas due to production losses and the impact on the international trade of animals and animal products with disease\u2010free countries. For example, the 2001 FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom had an estimated cost of $13 billion US (Thompson et al., 2002). The direct costs of the 1997\u20131998 CSF epizootic in the Netherlands, excluding loss of exports, amounted to $2 billion US and the slaughter of approximately 10 million pigs (Terpstra & de Smit, 2000).",

The disease is endemic in many parts of South America, Asia and Africa. The aetiological agent is the FMD virus (FMDV, Picornaviridae, Aphthovirus). Non\u2010FMD viruses that can cause clinically indistinguishable vesicular lesions in swine include swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV, Picornaviridae, Enterovirus) and vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV, Caliciviridae), a virus derived from feeding pigs seal meat contaminated with San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV; Zimmerman, Karriker, Ramirez, Schwartz, & Stevenson, 2012). CSF virus (CSFV, Flaviviridae) causes haemorrhagic disease in pigs (Giammarioli, Pellegrini, Casciari, & Mia, 2008) and lesions in less severe cases (Zimmerman et al., 2012). African swine fever virus (ASFV, Asfarviridae) also causes haemorrhagic fever (Costard et al., 2009; Giammarioli et al., 2008) that is clinically indistinguishable from infection with CSFV.",

Virus isolation is often considered the gold standard, but ELISA and real\u2010time reverse transcriptase (RT)\u2010PCR are faster and thus more suitable for use as screening tests. Conventional and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assays have been developed for CSFV (Wernike, Hoffmann, & Beer, 2013), ASFV (Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Pinero et al., 2013) and FMDV (Hole, Clavijo, & Pineda, 2006; King et al., 2006; Reid et al., 2009) and its differentials that include vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; Hole et al., 2006; Rasmussen, Uttenthal, & Ag\u00fcero, 2006), SVDV (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008; N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 1998), and VESV (Reid et al., 2007). User\u2010friendly reverse transcription insulated isothermal PCR (RT\u2010iiPCR) assays performed on compact, field\u2010deployable instruments with automatic display of \u201c+\u201d or \u201c\u2212\u201d results have also been described for CSFV (Lung et al., 2015) and FMDV (Ambagala et al., 2016). Real\u2010time multiplex PCR assays have been reported for the detection of FMDV and CSFV (Shi et al., 2016; Wernike et al., 2013) and other targets (Haines, Hofmann, King, Drew, & Crooke, 2013; Li et al., 2013; Rasmussen et al., 2006; Wernike et al., 2012). Although RT\u2010iiPCR and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR are rapid and highly sensitive, separate single\u2010target reactions are normally performed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease when testing for the presence of foreign animal disease pathogens. Thus, a user\u2010friendly, multiplex diagnostic test for differential diagnosis of high\u2010consequence foreign animal diseases could be a useful tool.",

            "text": "In addition to the major vesicular diseases of swine, CSFV and ASFV, two viruses indigenous to North America; porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2, Circoviridae) and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV, Arteriviridae), which are responsible for most of the production losses to the North American pig industry (Nicholson et al., 2011; Zimmerman et al., 2012), were also tested with available resources to evaluate the potential of this technology for testing of indigenous diseases. Depending on the strain of the virus and the immune status of the host, there is considerable variation in clinical signs of PRRS. Typically, PRRSV infection causes mild to severe respiratory disease in newborn and growing pigs and reproductive failure in pregnant sows (Lunney et al., 2016) and can also cause apoptosis in organs such as the lungs, testes, lymph nodes and thymus (Karniychuk et al., 2011). PCV2 infection can lead to lymphoid depletion and immunosuppression in pigs and is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus\u2010associated disease (PCVAD). Infections can also cause wasting and increased mortality, as well as lesions in the lymphatic area (Meng, 2013).",

The development and evaluation of traditional microarrays for subtyping and multiplex detection of viruses that affect livestock have been previously described (Ban\u00e9r et al., 2007; Hindson et al., 2008; Jack et al., 2009; Lenhoff et al., 2008; Lung et al., 2011, 2016). The assay described by Ban\u00e9r et al. (2007) detected FMDV, SVDV, VSV, and differentiated between the two serotypes of VSV. Lung et al. (2011) described an assay that detected four vesicular disease viruses (FMDV, VSV, SVDV and VESV) and differentiated between the seven serotypes of FMDV (A, O, C, Asia 1, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3) and the two serotypes of VSV (New Jersey & Indiana). These methods are laborious to perform, utilize conventional slide microarrays that rely on slower passive hybridization and require multiple pieces of equipment for capture probe printing, hybridization, washing, and slide scanning. In this study, the development and initial validation of an electronic microarray platform that integrates and automates capture probe printing with microarray hybridization, washing, and reporting on a single instrument and allows for onsite updating of probe sequences and custom printing of capture probes by the user for the detection of multiple viruses is described.",

Primer and probe design were performed as described previously (Lung et al., 2011, 2012) using AlleleID\u00ae v. 7.7 (Premier BioSoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA), Clone Manager v 9.0 software (Scientific and Educational Software, Cary, NC, USA) and BioEdit (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) using all publicly available sequences from NCBI. Primers were tested in silico using IDT's OligoAnalyzer 3.1 (http://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer), and any primers with self\u2010 and hetero\u2010dimers with a \u0394G \u2265 \u221211 kcal/mole were modified or screened out. The reverse primers were synthesized with the reverse complementary sequence of the NGEN\u2122 Red Universal Reporter Probe (Nexogen, San Diego, CA) at the 5\u2032 end (Lung et al., 2011). The primers were also evaluated in silico as previously described (Lung et al., 2017) against non\u2010target viruses using NCBI's electronic PCR (e\u2010PCR, Rotmistrovsky, Jang, & Schuler, 2004; Schuler, 1997) to evaluate potential cross\u2010reactivities. Furthermore, all unique primer pairs used in the multiplex PCR were tested against all non\u2010redundant nucleotide sequences of non\u2010FMDV picornaviruses (n = 61,995 unique sequences). This was achieved using a Python script developed in\u2010house to generate a multi\u2010FASTA file with all the unique primer pairs in the multiplex PCR (e.g., the forward primer of FMDV and the reverse primer of ASFV) that target viruses other than the viruses for which the primers were originally designed. The table was used as the input for the e\u2010PCR program to test the primers in silico. Hits that were returned with less than four mismatches were evaluated with ThermoBLAST's in silico simulations under reaction conditions to predict possible hybridizations based on thermodynamic parameters as well as sequence complementarity (SantaLucia, 2007). Candidate probes were screened for predicted specificity using NCBI BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Virus\u2010specific candidate probes that did not show significant matches to the other target viruses (probes exhibiting <25% overall identity and cross\u2010homologous regions of less than eight nucleotides) were then screened on the NanoChip400 microarray (Nexogen) against a reference panel of viruses. All capture probes were modified with 5\u2032\u2010biotinylation to allow attachment to the streptavidin\u2010containing hydrogel of the microarray. All primers and probes were synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA).",

Due to the ability of the electronic microarray assay to print capture probes on site, RT\u2010PCR primers and probes for PRRSV and PCV2 were tested with available samples to evaluate the potential use of electronic microarray assays for detection of indigenous diseases. The seven\u2010plex RT\u2010PCR and electronic microarray assay successfully amplified and accurately detected laboratory amplified (n = 58), experimentally inoculated (spiked, n = 8), and PRRSV\u2010positive field samples (n = 10). All capture probes were highly specific and showed no cross\u2010reactivity with heterologous viruses, non\u2010target bacteria and viruses, or samples from healthy animals. PRRSV was originally detected in North America and Europe almost simultaneously (Christianson & Joo, 1994; Lunney et al., 2016). The two genotypes were genetically diverse with about 55%\u201370% nucleotide identity (Lunney et al., 2016). Due to the high genetic diversity of RNA viruses and the lack of more PRRSV (especially genotype 2) isolates available for testing, regular evaluation of the primers and probe sequences against newly available sequences and additional validation will be needed. The large number of capture probes (up to 400 for the electronic microarray used here) should allow better coverage of genetically diverse strains compared with real\u2010time RT\u2010PCRs, which can typically accommodate only a few probes. The ability to print custom capture probes on site without additional instrumentation allows the assay to be updated conveniently.",

            "text": "Conventional testing methods, such as virus isolation, ELISA and PCR, have been advocated by the OIE as gold standard tests for the detection of many viral infections. Although these methods can be highly sensitive to specific viral serotypes, methods like virus isolation are time\u2010consuming, requiring multiple blind passages of a sample to generate usable amounts of infectious material. Additionally, multiple tests are required to detect coinfections or to differentiate between species with clinically indistinguishable signs. Although multiplex real\u2010time RT\u2010PCRs have been described for many swine pathogens (Haines et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Rasmussen et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2016; Wernike et al., 2012, 2013), the diagnosis of FMDV, SVDV, CSFV and ASFV still requires the performance of multiple single tests. Automated multiplex assays can potentially reduce labour cost and handling time. The highest analytical sensitivities observed for the 7\u2010plex RT\u2010PCR were as follows: PRRSV, PCV2 and ASFV which have the smallest amplicons (379\u2013537 bp). Although the microarray assay successfully detected FMDV in dpi 1 samples from experimentally infected animals, the multiplex RT\u2010PCR was less efficient for amplification of FMDV, which had the largest amplicon size in the assay (971 bp). This is most likely due to reduced PCR efficiencies for large amplicons (Cheng, Fockler, Barnes, & Higuchi, 1994; Huang, Arnheim, & Goodman, 1992). The FMDV primers used in this study were specifically designed to amplify the highly variable VP1 capsid protein coding region to allow subtyping into the seven known FMDV serotypes either in the same assay or in a separate assay (unpublished results) or by sequencing. The choice of RT\u2010PCR primers that generates a smaller FMDV amplicon could (e.g., Moniwa et al., 2007) potentially further increase the detection limit of the assay for FMDV. With 22 primers in the described multiplex RT\u2010PCR, there may also be interactions between the different primers that reduce the efficiency of the amplification. When the PCR primers for PRRSV and PCV2 were removed and placed in a separate RT\u2010PCR, an increase in sensitivity was observed for FMDV, SVDV, VESV and CSFV. The electronic microarray component of the assay showed a reduction in sensitivity for some target pathogens both in this and other studies (Lung et al., 2016, 2017 and unpublished results) when compared with the RT\u2010PCR component of the assay. Possible explanations for this reduction in sensitivity at the microarray stage could be the formation of secondary structure of certain capture probes, the amplicon or the annealing of the two strands of the amplicons which could prevent efficient hybridization between the capture probes and the amplicon under the experimental conditions. The use of asymmetric PCR to generate single\u2010stranded products, increased amount of capture probe and/or amplicon may also further increase the sensitivity of the assay. Although not tested in this study due to resource constraints, previously published electronic microarray assays for detection of avian, swine and bovine viruses (Lung et al., 2012, 2016, 2017), were able to detect the presence of more than one target. Due to potentially high loads of viruses such as PCV2 in many countries, the splitting of the seven\u2010plex RT\u2010PCR into a duplex RT\u2010PCR for PRRSV and PCV2 and a five\u2010plex RT\u2010PCR for the other viruses, as described in this study, will improve the sensitivity of the assay for the detection of reportable diseases.",

Further improvements in assay sensitivity and integration of the PCR with the electronic microarray in the new NanoChip400 XL electronic microarray platform could make this novel automated microarray technology a useful tool for multipathogen detection and subtyping.",
