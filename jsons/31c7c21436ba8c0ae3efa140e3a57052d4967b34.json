In December, 2019, a new coronavirus, now recognized as COVID-19, began to cause respiratory illness in Wuhan, China. The epidemic began in a fish market and is most similar to snake, pangolin, horseshoe crab, and bat corona viruses. In humans it is spread by respiratory droplets. It can remain alive on plastic surfaces for over 72 hours. It is spread by respiratory droplets. At the Shattuck lecture in Boston in 2018. Bill Gates called for a \"clear road map for a comprehensive pandemic preparedness and response system (1).\" COVID-19 presents with nasal secretions, cough, dyspnea, fever, myalgia and occasionally diarrhea. Around 15% may go on to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome for 5 days, but may last up to 14 days. Viral shedding may last up to 37 days. Over 95% of hospitalized patients have abnormal chest computed tomography (2). On CT, ground glass opacities with a reticular pattern, a subplural line, fibrotic streaks and an air bronchogram were the most common signs (3). These findings allowed COVID-19 pneumonia to be separated from classical viral pneumonia. From the laboratory point of view lymphocytopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated interleukin-6, elevated lactic dehydrogenase, hypoalbuminemia, a decreased CD8 count increased ferritin and decreased procalcitonin (4). In addition, very high angiotensin II levels were present. Highly elevated d-dimer levels are associated with mortality for people on ventilators.",

For older persons the problem with social isolation is loneliness (9) . Loneliness leads to depression, cognitive dysfunction, disability, cardiovascular disease and increased mortality. Obviously, prevention also requires regular hand washing and cleaning of surfaces. Wearing a mask does not provide protection for the individual. Finally, the first vaccine has just started testing. If it or other vaccines under development mount an adequate antibody response there will be a need to try to rapidly bring it to the general public. It is important to recognize that some persons, like \"Typhoid Mary\" who spread typhoid fever in the 1910s, may be asymptomatic. Thus, distance must be kept from everybody.",

Chloroquine phosphate, an anti-malarial, has been shown to be useful in treating COVID-19 pneumonia (10) . Remdesivir, an antiviral drug developed to treat Ebola, has been suggested to have positive effects in COVID-19 infected patients with severe respiratory disease (11) . These patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated liver function tests. Some patients with severe COVID-19 disease develop cytokine storm and this may be prevented with toclizumab. Passive infusion of polyclonal plasma antibodies from persons who have had COVID-19 infection has been suggested and monoclonal antibodies to COVID-19 are under development (12) . Finally, COVID-19 binds to the soluble portion of the ACE-2 receptor and this seems essential for the virus to enter cells. The possibility of a monoclonal antibody to the soluble portion of the ACE-2 receptor is under consideration. It is uncertain whether stopping the use of ACE 1 inhibitors which increase ACE-2 receptors should be undertaken. However, this EDITORIAL COVID-19 AND OLDER ADULTS J.E. MORLEY 1 , B. VELLAS 2 may explain the increased virulence of COVID-19 in persons with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. COVID-19 infected patients may do worse if taking ibuprofen, so it is recommended that patients take acetaminophen or paracetamol for fever and pain.",

Other factors that appear to play a role in the increased severity in older persons are the decline in immune function and alterations in the ACE 2 receptor. There is need for rapid development of a COVID-19 vaccine and its deployment among the population. In the meantime, social distancing, careful hand washing and using antiseptic wipes to clean surfaces and door handles before touching them represent the appropriate preventive measures. During the pandemic it is especially important to isolate older persons in nursing homes and to provide support when nursing home staff need to be quarantined. With good population health approaches, it is expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will be controlled in a relatively short time period.",
