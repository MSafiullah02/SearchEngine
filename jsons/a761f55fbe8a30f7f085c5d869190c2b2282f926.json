            "text": "Berk et al., \"A Deubiquitylase with an Unusually High-affinity Ubiquitin-binding Domain from the Scrub Typhus Pathogen Orientia tsutsugamushi\" Effector proteins of pathogenic bacteria can disturb and/or hijack immune signaling pathways of host cells. Such signaling pathways are controlled by ubiquitylation, and therefore, some effector proteins possess E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase activity or deubiquitylating (DUB) activity. The CE clan/Ulp1like proteases are a major DUB family of bacterial effectors. Functional and structural mechanisms underlying their DUB activities have been extensively studied. In this study, Berk et al. present the apo-and Ub-bound structures of the CE clan/Ulp1-like protease domain in a likely effector protein of the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi (OtDUB). OtDUB binds to three Ub molecules, which occupy the S1 and S2 sites in the catalytic domain and the high-affinity binding site in the additional Ub-binding domain (UBD). The S2 site or the additional UBD is not included in the CE clan/Ulp1-like protease domains of known structures. However, unfortunately, physiological significance of these two structural properties is unclear. The structure suggests the preference to K63 linkage, but OtDUB seems to cleave K48-linked chains as well as K63-linked chains. The functional role of the additional UBD is also unclear. I would like to suggest the following points to be improved if this study would be published.",

These mutations appear to affect cleavage of K48 chains but not K63 chains, presumably because the effect on K63-linked chains is masked by the additional S2 interaction. Can the authors support this with a Ub-AMC assay? And possibly with S1-site mutations in the VR-2 region as well? 5) Given the disorder-order transition observed in VR-1 upon Ub binding (Fig. 5f ), I am surprised that blocking this interaction with the V203D mutation does not maintain the disordered state enough to affect Ub binding to the S1 site and thus DUB activity (Fig. S4a ). By eye this mutant might be slightly slower than the WT enzyme. Quantitation of this assay and/or kinetic analysis with the Ub-AMC substrate could be more telling and possibly indicate a role for the OtDUB VR-1 UBD in activating DUB function (akin to the interesting regulation of OTUB1 in humans).",

The crystal structures of the DUB domain of OtDUB alone and bound to three molecules of ubiquitin were presented. The structure of OtDUB reveals a similar core fold of CE clan proteases with distinct variable regions that are involved in ubiquitin binding. Surprisingly when co-crystallizing OtDUB with free ubiquitin, there were three ubiquitin bound in the structure. One bound at the S1 site, one at the S2 site and the other bound to a unique backside surface of the C-terminal region of OtDUB which the authors referred to as the ubiquitinbinding domain (UBD). Interestingly the C-terminus of ubiquitin at S2 is in proximity of K63 of ubiquitin at S1 leading to the hypothesis of K63-ubiquitin chain (n>3) recognition. The authors showed that OtDUB has preference for cleaving longer K63 ubiquitin chain (n>2) and does not cleave di-ubiquitin. Likewise it also cleaves K48-ubiquitin chain. The structure explains a model for how OtDUB could bind a tri-K63-ubiquitin. Mutation in the S2 binding site reduced cleavage of K63-tetraubiquitin but had little effect on K48-tetra-ubiquitin. While it is unclear how OtDUB recognizes K48ubiquitin chain, the structure showed that K48 of S1 ubiquitin is accessible for conjugation with ubiquitin. Lastly the authors showed that the backside of UBD has a strong binding affinity for ubiquitin (Kd of 5 nM), which is two-orders of magnitude tighter than previously reported UBDubiquitin interaction.",

First, these reactions were performed on separate western blots and it should be performed on the same gel to make such comparison.

The S2 site or the additional UBD is not included in the CE clan/Ulp1-like protease domains of known structures. However, unfortunately, physiological significance of these two structural properties is unclear. The structure suggests the preference to K63 linkage, but OtDUB seems to cleave K48-linked chains as well as K63-linked chains. The functional role of the additional UBD is also unclear.

Furthermore, when F59T is preincubated with ubiquitin (Fig   6e and f) the cleavage of K63-linked dimers is still accelerated, suggesting ubiquitin binding to another site is required for maximal turnover; this binding is likely to be to the UBD, which would allow full folding of the domain, including the VR-1 surface that contributes to S1. 5) Given the disorder-order transition observed in VR-1 upon Ub binding (Fig. 5f) , I am surprised that blocking this interaction with the V203D mutation does not maintain the disordered state enough to affect Ub binding to the S1 site and thus DUB activity (Fig.   S4a ). By eye this mutant might be slightly slower than the WT enzyme. Quantitation of this assay and/or kinetic analysis with the Ub-AMC substrate could be more telling and possibly indicate a role for the OtDUB VR-1 UBD in activating DUB function (akin to the interesting regulation of OTUB1 in humans). where both can cleave more effeciently than OtDUB 1-259 due to a loss of the negative regulating UBD (Figure 6h, Supplementary Figure 5f ).",

First, these reactions were performed on separate western blots and it should be performed on the same gel to make such comparison. Second, Fig S4A showed that V203D abrogated UBD-ubiquitin interaction and exhibited similar activity as WT. If UBD has an inhibitory role one would expect V203D to be more active. Lastly, Fig.4A right panel showed that VR-1 makes extensive contact with S1 ubiquitin and 1-177 construct lacks this whole surface. One would predict to have a more severe defect than the point mutations in Fig. 4B The consequences of lacking the VR-1 S1 site contacts in 1-177 has variable effects dependent on chain length and OtDUB concentration. For both K48 and K63 diUb and Ub-AMC, kinetics are slower with 1-177 than the longer fragments, at both low and high OtDUB concentration (Supplementary Figures 2b, c) . The impact here on diUb is the most telling for the requirement of a fully intact VR-1 for proper cleavage. For extended chains (K48 and K63) the cleavage by 1-177 is more efficient than 1-259 and 1-311 when the OtDUB is at 500 nM due to the self-inhibitory defects of the UBD (Supplementary chains (based on the complex structure) and this positions extended K63 chains more efficiently into the active site even when half of the S1 site is absent.",

This is most likely due to the presence of the S2 site having a preference for K63 chains -as inferred from the Ub-OtDUB structure-and this sequesters the K63 diUb from the active site. If the time points were extended in this figure, one would likely see a reduction in K63 diUb levels for F59T, which has an inactivated S2, as is seen in Figure 3f 5. Figure 1D legend missing.

Such signaling pathways are controlled by ubiquitylation, and therefore, some effector proteins possess E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase activity or deubiquitylating (DUB) activity. The CE clan/Ulp1-like proteases are a major DUB family of bacterial effectors. Functional and structural mechanisms underlying their DUB activities have been extensively studied. In this study, Berk et al. present the apo-and Ub-bound structures of the CE clan/Ulp1-like protease domain in a likely effector protein of the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi (OtDUB).

The original Figure 6b has been replaced with Figure 7d, which directly OtDUB is replaced by Thr in O. chuto DUB (Fig. 6a). In Fig. 3c, the F59T mutation of OtDUB decreases the cleavage activity for K63-linked chains. However, in Fig. 6b, O. chuto DUB shows substantial activity for K63-linked chains. Does O. chuto DUB really have the S2 site? Please explain this. Originally, we were also wondering if the OtDUB F59T would make K63 cleavage comparable to OcDUB, but to our surprise, the mutation slowed cleavage down, suggesting the S2 site normally assists in K63 chain cleavage and is no longer functional in OtDUB F59T. It was an excellent idea to test if OcDUB has an S2 site at all, which would clarify the F59T OtDUB result. To this end we performed titration experiments with increasing molar equivalents of ubiquitin incubated with either OtDUB 1-177 -C135A or OcDUB 1-177 -C134A. To simplify interpretation, we removed the UBD and mutated the active site for stable interaction with ubiquitin. In these titration experiments, shown in new Figure 7f and Supplementary Figure 6a, the OtDUB DUB domain clearly has the capacity to bind 2 ubiquitins (via the S1 and S2 sites), while the OcDUB appears to only bind ubiquitin in a 1:1 ratio, arguing against an S2 site in OcDUB. Furthermore, OtDUB 1-177 -F59T,C135A mirrored the OcDUB 1-177 -C134A data suggesting the F59T mutation is sufficient for disrupting the S2-site. 12. Is pre-incubation performed in Fig. S1b also effective for UBD mutants (V203D, F207D and L221D)?The short answer is no. For extended chain cleavage where the OtDUB is at 500 nM (a concentration where self-inhibition is strongest), the V203D mutant actually alleviates the self-inhibition and results in complete K48/K63 substrate cleavage irrespective of ubiquitin preincubation(Figure 6h, Supplementary Figure 5f). For extended chain cleavage with 50 nM OtDUB (where self-inhibition is insignificant), preincubation with ubiquitin has no added benefit (data not shown). For di-ubiquitin cleavage, preincubation of V203D with ubiquitin had no added effect on cleavage for K48 or K63(Figure 6a, quantified in 6b and Supplementary 5a). We think the major reason we see higher activity",

In particular, the preference for longer polyubiquitin chains and surprising high-affinity interaction with monomeric ubiquitin are very striking and new to this family of deubiquitinases. The work is of high quality and will be of broad interest to researchers studying the ubiquitin system or host-pathogen interactions.
