The neurotoxic sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), one of the most toxic non-proteinaceous poisons along with aconitine, veratridine, saxitoxin (STX), batrachotoxin (BTX) and palytoxin (PTX), is widely spread in nature, especially in marine ecosystems. TTX, traditionally esteemed famous for its occurrence in the inner organs (especially liver and ovaries) of the Japanese culinaric delicacy tora fugu, the globe (tiger puffer) fish Spheroides rubripes (Tetraodontidae), is to be depicted as substituted 2,8-dioxa-adamantane1 (Fig. 1\n).1, 2, 3 Daigremontianin was isolated from the tropical flower Kalanchoe daigremontiana Hamet et Perr. (Crassulaceae) and was shown to be a steroid (bufadienolide) 2,8,9-trioxa-adamantane (Fig. 1).4, 5 Synthetic adamantanes, or tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decanes, are used as antiviral chemotherapeutics [amantadine (1-amino-adamantane) and rimantadine systemically against influenza A virus, tromantadine topically against herpes simplex virus type 1 infections] and antiparkinsonian (muscle relaxant) drugs [amantadine as central dopaminergic, memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane) as neuroprotective N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-subtype glutamate receptor antagonist] (Fig. 1).",

No \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated, quinoid carbonyl absorption at wavenumbers between 1700 and 1600 cm\u22121 could be seen. Instead a very broad OH band between 3650 and 1800 cm\u22121 dominates the IR spectrum. It represents a valence bond vibration of hydrogen-bonded O\u2013H, and, respectively, intra/intermolecular polymeric associated chelate O\u2013H. At 2900 cm\u22121 a methyl group C\u2013H and at 2825 cm\u22121 a methylene group C\u2013H valence bond vibration can be identified. At 1590 and 1520 cm\u22121 C\u2013C aromatic valence bond vibrations of a pyridine heterocycle can be detected. At wavenumbers of 1430 cm\u22121 a methylene C\u2013H deformation vibration and 1395 cm\u22121 a methyl group C\u2013H deformation vibration can be analyzed. Very characteristic is the aromatic C\u2013O phenolic valence bond vibration at 1210 cm\u22121. The two bands at 1065 cm\u22121 (Ar\u2013CH2\u2013OH) and 1110 cm\u22121 are aliphatic C\u2013O valence bond vibrations. The absorption band at 820 cm\u22121 is fitting to a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted aromate with one isolated CH. Taken together, already the IR data unequivocally proof the unusual 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol structure because the 6-hydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)-1-methyl-8H-[1]benzopyrano[2,3-c]pyridin-8-one alternative would have a strong \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated, quinoid carbonyl absorption between wavenumbers of 1775 and 1650 cm\u22121 (preferably 1650\u20131700 cm\u22121, p-benzoquinone 1669 cm\u22121). The predominant, very broad OH band from 3650 to 1800 cm\u22121 peaking at 3350 cm\u22121 pointed to strongly associated intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the solid state of the brown substance KBr pellet. A similar effect was observed in the IR spectrum (in KBr) of the polyhydroxyl, solvent-retaining compound tetrodotoxin.3\n",

The product is soluble in sodium hydroxide solution and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to give yellow to brown solutions. The UV spectrum showed two maxima at 220.0 nm (\u03b5=22,443 L mol\u22121 cm\u22121) and 285.8 nm (\u03b5=11,591 L mol\u22121 cm\u22121), the molar mass for the calculation of the molar extinction coefficient \u03b5 was choosed as M=327.29 g/mol, the theoretic molar mass of 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol (Fig. 3).

The hypothesis that bananin is an highly intermolecular-associated material, leading to a nearly black colour through interaromatic charge-transfer complexation between the pyridine heterocycles and hydrogen-bonding between the trioxa-adamantane-triol heterotricycles is supported by combination of the IR, UV, and 1H NMR data (Fig. 6\n). An instruction protocol for the isolation of amorphous bananin picrate was developed. Amorphous bananin picrate is soluble in water with intense yellow colour and liberates brown-black amorphous bananin by treatment with strong bases (NaOH solution). The intermolecular network leading to the black colour of bananin is interrupted in the yellow bananin picrate (Fig. 6) by complexing the pyridine heterocycle with picric acid. Furthermore, a sodium hydroxide-containing solution of bananin monosodium salt in water both forms a blue copper complex with Cu(OH)2 and a white zinc complex with Zn(OH)2. It is proposed that bananin behaves as bidentate chelate donor to build the tetragonal-planar coordination complex (SP-4-1)-bis[1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triolato(1-)-O\n2,O\n3\u2018]copper (Fig. 7\n) and the tetrahedral coordination complex (T-4)-bis[1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triolato(1-)-O\n2,O\n3\u2018]zinc (Fig. 7). In addition, it should be mentioned that bananin has lost most of its vitamin B6 character. The pyridine nitrogen is less basic than in pyridoxal and the UV parameters of pyridoxine/pyridoxal are left. Instead a typical phenolic behaviour is found and the tendency of vitamin B6 to exist mostly in a well-defined zwitterionic state at physiologic pH 7.4 is abandoned in bananin.",

Pyridoxal kinase can phosphorylate an array of vitamin B6-derivatives with modulated substituents in position 4 of the pyridine heterocycle, additionally to its natural substrates pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine.14, 15 This was theoretically proofed by the crystal structure determination of sheep brain pyridoxal kinase16 which shows a tight binding of the 3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpyridine vitamin B6 core structure of pyridoxal in the substrate-binding pocket, but structural fill space at the 4-position of the vitamin B6 core element.16 Conclusively, it is reasonable to speculate that BN is converted into BNP by the human tissue-ubiquitous pyridoxal kinase,13 and such is \u2018metabolically trapped\u2019 inside the cell after cellular uptake by vitamin B6 carrier systems. Through usage of vitamin B6 metabolic systems high intracellular concentrations of BNP could be achieved since the phosphate group-induced zwitterionic, hydrophilic appearance of BNP prevents reverse cell membrane passage.",

            "text": "In analogy to the postulated antiviral mechanism of the retinoid vitamin A-vitamin B6 conjugate analogue B6RA at RGD and RLE viral protein target sequences,12 a covalent 1,4-dihydro-4-pyridinyl active ester formation of BNP with RGD aspartic acid residues in RNA-viral protein target sequences is proposed (Fig. 10\n). BNP should have a similar salt-bridge amphoteric affinity to RX(D/E) protein sequence motifs like B6RA. Therefore, it could covalently bind to viral RX(D/E) sequences and, analogously to B6RA, chemically modify important viral proteins, thus making them functionally obsolete. Together with the putative antilentiviral retinoid vitamin A\u2013vitamin B6 conjugate analogue B6RA, BNP is proposed to serve as effector in a system of protein target sequences RX(D/E) of RNA virus components. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) trans-activating transcriptional regulatory protein Tat sequences PRGDP and PRLEP were suggested as possible targets of B6RA.12 I propose a binding of B6RA/BNP to Tat PRGDP tat exon 2-encoded C-terminal sequence which serves also for cross-talk with cellular tumor suppressor protein p53.12 BNP could form an active ester at the tat exon 2-encoded C-terminal PRGDP sequence (Fig. 10) by addition of the aspartate (d) residue to the trioxa-adamantane-triol 4-substituent-activated pyridine heterocycle in BNP (Fig. 10). This 1,4-dihydro-4-pyridinyl active ester species would be principally able to cross-link Tat d-amide-like to amino groups of DNA nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine) in HIV-1 proviral integrated U3/R sequences of HIV-1 5\u2032-long terminal repeat or, more generally, in host cellular DNA. In this way, non-repairable Tat protein\u2013DNA complexes would serve as trigger for DNA damage-induced apoptosis selectively in cells in which Tat is present. As a result the host organism would be specifically extricated from integrated HIV-1 proviruses.12 A database search36 and most recent status Medline/PubMed search37 for RGD-similar sequences was performed for human RNA viruses (Table 1\n). The most important human RNA virus pathogens were considered. Surprisingly, many indispensable virus proteins contain often conserved B6RA- and BNP-binding triplets RX(D/E) which are frequently surrounded by hydrophobic protein sequence strips enhancing affinity for the B6RA hydrophobic vitamin A chain (Table 1). Candidate targets of B6RA and BNP were found within proteins of RNA viruses like Picornaviridae (poliovirus, human coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Kunjin virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus), Togaviridae (rubella virus), Coronaviridae (human coronavirus, human SARS-associated coronavirus), Rhabdoviridae (rabies virus), Paramyxoviridae (human parainfluenza virus, measles virus, human respiratory syncytial virus), Filoviridae (Marburg virus, Ebola virus), Bornaviridae (Borna disease virus), Bunyaviridae (Hantaan virus), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), Reoviridae (human rotavirus), and Retroviridae (HIV-1). The antiviral scope of B6RA/BNP may be related to the broad-spectrum anti-RNA-viral virustatic ribavirin38 because ribavirin is mostly active against RNA viruses by inhibiting inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase as ribavirin 5\u2032-monophosphate, and mRNA precursor 5\u2032-capping as ribavirin 5\u2032-triphosphate.38 The actual therapeutic value of the B6RA/BNP system for chemotherapeutic treatment of RNA-viral human disease conditions remains elusive until comprehensive experimental verification is gained.",

The Knoevenagel condensation of phloroglucinol and pyridoxal hydrochloride yields pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol. Its heat treatment with 5 M hydrochloric acid firstly produces light yellow (4\u2032RS)-1\u2032,4\u2032-dihydrobananin. Subsequently air oxidation in the heat precipitates the orange-yellow (4\u2032RS)-4\u2032-chloro-1\u2032,4\u2032-dihydrobananin which results from addition of hydrogen chloride to bananin. (4\u2032RS)-4\u2032-chloro-1\u2032,4\u2032-dihydrobananin eliminates hydrogen chloride by treatment with strong bases (NaOH). Finally, the brown-black bananin is isolated by help of its relative insolubility in water.",
