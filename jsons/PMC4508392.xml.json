            "text": "Human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was first isolated from samples obtained in California in 1962 from four children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis (1). The type strain isolated from one of these children was designated the Fermon strain. Subsequently, only small numbers of EV-D68 cases were reported until the early 2000s (2). However, from 2008 to 2012, outbreaks in Japan, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United States (Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona) have revealed EV-D68 as an emerging pathogen capable of causing severe respiratory illness (2\u20137). During the 2014 enterovirus/rhinovirus season in the United States, EV-D68 circulated at an unprecedented level (5). From August 2014 to January 2015, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health laboratories confirmed a total of 1,153 cases of respiratory illness caused by EV-D68, with \u226514 deaths. The spectrum of disease was diverse. Cases of flaccid paralysis have been reported in association with EV-D68 infection, but as of the time of this report, a causal relationship has not been proven (8). The infected individuals were primarily children and resided in 49 states and the District of Columbia (5). The CDC also reported that there were likely millions of EV-D68 infections in which the etiology was not determined (5).",

We also observed this pattern at St. Louis Children's Hospital in St. Louis, MO. Because efforts to define the outbreak were hampered by the lack of a test for EV-D68 that did not require nucleotide sequencing, we undertook the development of a rapid and specific reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay. We began by sequencing the genome of a representative EV-D68 isolate from St. Louis to obtain the sequence information required to define an assay with optimal sensitivity and specificity (9). EV-D68 causes respiratory illness, and the virus can be found in respiratory secretions, such as saliva, nasal mucus, or sputum (7), of an infected person. Therefore, an appropriate assay would primarily focus on evaluating respiratory disease due to EV-D68 by targeting nasopharyngeal and other respiratory specimens.",

            "text": "To create an assay with specificity for EV-D68, we performed comprehensive in silico analysis of all viruses in the NIH GenBank genetic sequence database using a k-mer approach described below to identify unique and contiguous sequences for candidate RT-PCR primers and probes. The k-mer frequency-based methods were originally used in whole-genome shotgun assembly algorithms to remove reads containing frequently occurring subsequences of length k during genome assembly (12, 13). We started by creating a consolidated viral sequence database by collecting all Fasta nucleotide sequences from viruses that infect vertebrate or invertebrate hosts, as found in the following areas of GenBank: RefSeq, Genome Neighbors, and Influenza Virus Resource. The database contained sequences from 34 viral families, which consisted of 190 annotated viral genera and 337 species. By design, this database contained only a single complete EV-D68 reference genome (St. Louis [STL] 2014 strain, GenBank accession no. KM881710.2). Comprehensive k-mer analysis was performed on the database by indexing and reporting all 20-mer subsequences using the Tallymer software (14). We eliminated 20-mers that were not unique in the k-mer pool, thus leaving 20-mers that were unique to EV-D68 and those unique to other viral species. EV-D68-unique 20-mers were collected using BLAST (15) to align all unique 20-mers to the EV-D68 reference genome, requiring 100% identity. The EV-D68-specific 20-mers were consolidated into contiguous sequences by merging overlapping sequences with the BEDTools suite of utilities (16). Contiguous sequences of \u226560 bp were identified as promising regions for RT-PCR primer and probe design. Of these, a 141-bp region was selected based on its uniqueness, length, and relative conservation among available EV-D68 nucleotide sequences. Notably, this region was within the VP1 gene that is considered the gold standard for enterovirus typing (17, 18).",

These nucleotide sequences were mapped and visualized online using MUSCLE (19) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) (http://www.viprbrc.org) website to produce a multiple-sequence alignment (MSA). Focusing on the candidate 141-bp region within the MSA, we evaluated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies and identified conserved segments appropriate for primer and probe placement. The GenScript real-time PCR primer design application was used to evaluate primer/probe options. The criteria for ideal amplicon selection included primer sequences of \u226520 bp, PCR amplicons of <100 bp in length, and melting temperature (Tm) within a range of 55 to 70\u00b0C.",

Our RT-PCR primer and probe sequences were derived computationally by k-mer-mediated filtering of potentially cross-reactive non-EV-D68 viral sequences. Broad detection of EV-D68 was achieved through multiple-sequence alignment review using all published EV-D68 VP1 regions available through GenBank. Reduced sensitivity for the older and more distant Fermon EV-D68 type strain, which has only 87.9% identity to the genome sequence of the St. Louis virus, led us to modify the assay, which then proved capable of efficiently amplifying more divergent EV-D68 viruses as well.",

In addition, the WashU assays were \u226510-fold more sensitive for detecting EV-D68 than the FDA-approved commercial assays (i.e., Luminex xTAG RVP, GenMark Dx eSensor RVP, Biofire FilmArray RP, and Cepheid GeneXpert) for enterovirus/rhinovirus detection (Table 4), with the further advantage of specific identification of EV-D68. The WashU assays showed no evidence of amplification of other enteroviruses, including the relatively closely related EV-D70 virus, or rhinoviruses.",

It is also possible that the assay cross-reacts with a subtype that has yet to be discovered. Second, although we have tried to show that our assay evaluated a broad range of EV-D68 strains, EV-D68 strains may exist or emerge with mutations in the PCR target region that cause the assay to miss that strain of the virus.",

This underscores the international interest in EV-D68 detection stimulated by the global reemergence of the virus in 2014. The assay targets a 60-bp region of the 5\u2032-nontranslated region of EV-D68. A comparison of the assay to the CDC RT-PCR and commercially available enterovirus/rhinovirus clinical assays was not reported in their paper. In our dilution tests, the assay was 10-fold less sensitive in detecting the 2014 outbreak strain of EV-D68 than the WashU assays. Furthermore, the WashU assays detected the undiluted outbreak specimen 7 cycles before the 5\u2032-nontranslated region-targeting assay reached detection. Because these assays detect completely different segments of the viral genome, they may have complementary value in future applications.",

The EV-D68-specific RT-PCR assay we have developed can be used for epidemiological studies of the EV-D68 outbreak and for virus monitoring in subsequent seasons. It is unclear at this time whether typing EV-D68 will be useful for patient management. However, some FDA-approved multiplex respiratory panels may not detect EV-D68 optimally or at all. In laboratories using those assays, an additional assay that detects EV-D68 will be useful for laboratory documentation of EV-D68 infection, which may help with prognosis, antibiotic use, and appropriate isolation. The ongoing importance of improved diagnostic capability for EV-D68 is underscored by the recent decision by the Department of Health and Human Services to encourage the development of EV-D68 testing capability by authorizing the emergency use of new in vitro diagnostics for EV-D68 detection (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-02-27/html/2015-04121.htm).",
