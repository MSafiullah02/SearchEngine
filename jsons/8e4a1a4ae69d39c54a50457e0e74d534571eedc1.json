Various forms of social distancing measures/testing practices were implemented in different countries/regions in order to stem the spread of the epidemic. Under those social distancing measures, rates of contact between individuals in different age groups are expected to significantly depart from the regular mixing patterns [2] . Under such circumstances, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the role of different age groups in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in different countries. While disease is most severe in older age groups, a sizeable share of COVID-19 related hospitalizations in Western countries belongs to individuals aged 20-55y [3] . A study of close contacts of COVID-19 cases in China [4] found comparable rates of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in different age groups. A better understanding is needed of the effect that different age groups play in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during its current stage.",

The idea of that method is that age groups that have an elevated role in propagating an epidemic due to higher contact rates and/or susceptibility to infection will have their share among all incident cases increase with time during the early states of the epidemic, particularly under containment efforts for which adherence varies between the different age groups. For example, if contact rates in one age group increase with time relative to another due to lesser adherence, incidence of infection in the former age group will increase relative to the latter. Additionally, if a given country comprises several regions with different growth rates for their epidemics, the age group that drives the incidence of infection in regions with faster growing/larger epidemics will have its share among all incident cases in the country increase with time. Temporal increase in the share of a given age group among all cases of infection can be evaluated using the relative risk (RR) statistic that estimates the ratio of the proportion of a given age group among all detected (reported) cases of COVID-19 for a later time period vs. an earlier time period. We note that for a given age group, the ratio between the number of detected COVID-19 cases and incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (case-detection rate) in that age group may vary with time due to changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and other factors. To minimize the effect of relative changes, for the different age groups, in the case-detection rates with time, we restrict our analysis to individuals aged 10-49y only as symptomatic older adults and younger children may be more likely to seek medical care/get tested compared to other age groups as the awareness of the dangers of the epidemic increased with time.",

One limitation is that the ratio between the number of detected COVID-19 cases and incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 cases (case-detection rate) may vary with time in each age group. We believe that it is unlikely that this phenomenon is more pronounced for individuals aged 15-34y compared to persons aged 35-49, namely that increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for individuals aged 15-34y are substantially larger compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y. Therefor, the observed temporal increases in the relative share of individuals aged 15-34y among detected COVID-19 cases in persons aged 10-49y should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. Another limitation is the uncertainty regarding the relation between the temporal rise in the share of a given age group among SARS-CoV-2 cases and the role that this age group plays in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Some of the factors supporting that relation are described in the 2 nd paragraph of the Introduction. Additionally, data on mixing patterns in different age groups during regular times [2] , as well as some evidence about the current social interactions of younger adults/older adolescents suggests that those age groups are expected to have the largest role in driving the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, which is indeed supported by our results.",
