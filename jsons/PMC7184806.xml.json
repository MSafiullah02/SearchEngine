The present literature review of the published evidence for PPE during orthopaedic surgery in a COVID-19 environment has highlighted the need for raised awareness of the types of PPE available for the surgical team, when they should be used and the definition of surgical AGPs. Interestingly, the WHO guidance on PPE for COVID-19 omitted the operating room, whereas UK NHS guidance evolved during the first few weeks of the UK lockdown [28, 33]. UK authorities eventually recognized surgery with high-speed devices as an AGP. Respiratory AGPs require FFP3 masks or powered air-purifying respirators, whereas surgical AGPs only require FFP2 masks [28]. Another option would be powered air-purifying respirators. Veterinary surgeons protect their surgical team from aerosilised Herpes virus particles using powered air-purifying respirators such as the 3 M Versaflo system with HEPA filter and an S533 cape [17].",
