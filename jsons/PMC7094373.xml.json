C2C12, 293 and Cos7 (ATCC) cell lines were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 1 g L\u22121 glucose, 0.1 mg ml\u22121 streptomycin, 100 U ml\u22121 penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone), in addition to 1 mg ml\u22121 G418 (Gibco/BRL) for the stable cell lines. The constructions of CHO-SG and CHO-ACE2 were described previously [5], [8]. The HCV E2 gene (the ectodomain of E2 protein from HCV polyprotein amino acid sequence 364\u2013673) was amplified from the template HCV-S1 [9] (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] accession no. AF356827) with primers E2F (5\u2032-GCAGATCTGCCACCatggtggggaactgggctaag-3\u2032) and E2R (5\u2032-GCatttaaatTCTGCCACTCTGTCGTAGAC-3\u2032). The PCR fragment was double digested with BglII/SwaI and inserted into the plasmid pEGFP-N1-S-EGFP [8] with the same treatment. The ectodomain of S-EGFP was replaced with the ectodomain of E2 to produce E2-EGFP, and the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains plus 20 amino acid residues in the outward juxtamembrane region of S protein were fused with the E2 protein. Stable cell lines of CHO-E2G, C2C12-E2G, and C2C12-SG were established by using lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as the transfection reagent and G418 for the selection. High-yield clones were selected by using a fluorescence microscope fitted with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter.",

Here two separate CHO stable cell lines established previously were used to reconstitute the cell\u2013cell fusion process: CHO-ACE2 (which expresses the human ACE2) and CHO-SG (which expresses the SARS\u2013CoV S protein). The surface expression of S on CHO-SG cells had been shown by nonpermeable immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using serum from a SARS convalescent patient, and the binding between CHO-SG and Vero E6 cells (ACE2 presenting cell line) was specifically blocked by either the serum from the SARS patient or a goat anti-ACE2 antibody [8]. The cellular surface expression of ACE2 on CHO-ACE2 cells was shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis [5]. We also established three more cell lines, with C2C12-SG being used for confirming the cell\u2013cell membrane fusion process that is mediated by S and ACE2 and being used as negative control cell lines CHO-E2G and C2C12-E2G. C2C12-SG was established in the same way as CHO-SG [8], using C2C12 cells as the transfection host. CHO-E2G and C2C12-E2G were established for expressing HCV E2 protein. The ACE2 was red fluorescence protein (RFP) tagged at the C terminus (see Supplementary Fig. 1), and the S and E2 were C-terminally tagged with EGFP (see Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2).",

The tagged SEAP could be unblocked and released extracellularly by the protease NS3/4A from the fusion encountered cells. Plasmids for the expression of NS3/4A or EGFP-4A/4B-SEAP (GS) were constructed (Fig. 2\n). To increase the accessibility of the 4A/4B linker to the NS3/4A proteases, mutations and modifications around the protease cleavage site were generated (Fig. 2). The fourth amino acid residue of the SEAP signal peptide was mutated to lysine (GSK) or arginine (GSR), and an octapeptide (DEDEDEDE) was intercalated in between EGFP and 4A/4B sequence for the construct GDS.

GS and its leucine mutants, GSK and GSR, all expressed near the basal level of extracellular SEAP activity, indicating that the 4A/4B linker might not be readily accessible to the protease, probably because it is too close to the hydrophobic core of the SEAP signal peptide or the hydrophobic region at the EGFP C terminus (Fig. 4\n). Indeed, when NS3/4A was cotransfected with GDS, a significant amount of SEAP activity that was detected in the culture supernatant was contributed by the extra octapeptide. Cotransfection of NS3/4A with the leucine mutation GDS derivatives, GDSG, GDSE, and GDSR, also yielded significant levels of extracellular SEAP activities, but the levels were lower than those with GDS. The cleavage activity of NS3/4A to GS or GDS was determined using Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B); the protease presented partial activity to GS, whereas the digestion to GDS was nearly completed. The expression levels of GS and GDS were also different, with the loading of GS samples in Fig. 3B being five times less than that of GDS samples.",

The sequence of GS was analyzed using the TMpred service (www.ch.embnet.org) for predicting possible transmembrane regions. The signal peptide (MLLLLLLLGLRLQLSLGI) of SEAP was strongly indicated as a transmembrane domain that may affect accessibility to the linker sequence for protease digestion. On the other hand, a range of 19 amino acid residues (219\u2013237) at the EGFP C terminus was also suggested as a possible transmembrane domain; although EGFP is known as a cytoplasmic protein, its behavior may be different as in a fusion protein. To increase the accessibility of the linker to protease activity, we first tried to make a minimum modification by mutating one amino acid residue in the SEAP signal peptide to abolish the putative transmembrane domain while maintaining the signal peptide. An analysis of the 18 amino acid residues comprising the signal sequence using the program SignalP 3.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP) suggested changing the fourth residue, leucine, to either lysine (GSK) or arginine (GSR). However, these modifications did not increase the extracellular SEAP activity; in fact, they could only hinder the process by decreasing the secretion efficiency of GDSG, GDSE, and GDSR (Fig. 3A).",

Because there are four negatively charged amino acid residues in 4A/4B, a negatively charged octapeptide was designed by composing Asp and Glu amino acid residues for limiting the interaction with 4A/4B and for making extra distance between 4A/4B and the hydrophobic region of EGFP. The Protean program in DNASTAR was used to compare the predicted hydrophilicity and surface probability of GS, GSK, and GDS (Fig. 4); the inserted octapeptide in GDS indeed increased the computed profiles for the region and possibly increased the protease accessibility. The result of cotransfected (GDS and NS3/4A) CHO cells supports our view of the accessibility; however, the octapeptide might not be the optimum. Some CHO-GDS stable clones still expressed a basal level of extracellular SEAP while they were transfected with NS3/4A (see Supplementary Fig. 3), and the secretion of SEAP from GDS and NS3/4A cotransfected 293 and Cos7 cells was insignificant. The parameters of the octapeptide could possibly be changed in length or modified with other hydrophilic amino acid residues. The cellular fusion between CHO-ACE2 and C2C12-SG cells is more drastic than that between CHO-ACE2 and CHO-SG cells, but the quantitation was limited by the low transfection efficiency of C2C12 cells. In addition, a promoter strong enough to drive the transient expression for either NS3/4A or GDS in C2C12 cells for the quantitative measurement is not available in our laboratory. We also established CHO-NS3/4A and CHO-GDS stable cell lines for the cell\u2013cell membrane fusion quantitative studies, but the transient expressions of either S or ACE2 were not sufficient to perform the process significantly.",

However, the development of a subgenomic HCV replicon system [12] has been critical in enabling preclinical evaluation of potential anti-HCV agents in support of drug discovery. The macrocyclic inhibitor BILN 2061 was identified using a substrate-based approach to designing inhibitors of the HCV NS3 active site [13], and subsequently identified inhibitors and NS3 mutants [13], [14], [15], [16] all were based on the studies using the replicon system. The quantitative method using NS3/4A and GDS could be used as the alternative way to screen for HCV NS3 inhibitors in vivo [10], [11] or to facilitate the studies of NS3 drug-resistant mutants by quantitative measurement. In this article, we have presented cell\u2013cell membrane fusion mediated by two stable CHO cell lines expressing recombinant SARS\u2013CoV S protein and human ACE2 individually. Moreover, the fusion process was used as a model for developing a quantitative measurement of extracellular SEAP via the transient expressions of HCV NS3/4A protease and GDS (secretion blocked SEAP) from these cell lines separately.",
