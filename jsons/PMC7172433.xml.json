If a known virus is suspected to be present in a biological sample, it is usually not difficult to use the known viral sequence to design specific PCR primers, and to implement a specific detection assay. However, in an era of emerging pathogens and bioterrorism (including the potential for bioterrorism agents genetically engineered to avoid detection using standard methods), improved methods for virus discovery and detection that are less dependent upon the availability of sequence information are needed. Moreover, if such methods were standardized, they could be used potentially to demonstrate (to a defined degree of sensitivity) the absence of a contaminating virus in a biological specimen with potential application to clinical or regulatory problems.",

These primers are designed to anneal to sequence regions highly conserved among members of a virus family, such as polymerase genes. Because these regions are almost never completely conserved, these consensus primers generally include some degeneracy that permits binding to all or the most common known variants on the conserved sequence. This general approach has been automated in an innovative high throughput system (Sampath et al., 2005). However, to be successful, these methods require sufficient sequence information on a group of related viruses to permit the design of consensus primers.",

Differential display also involves the comparison of amplified representational libraries of two or more different samples. RDA was used to discover HHV-8 (Chang et al., 1994) and TTV (Linnen et al., 1996), while differential display was used to first identify human metapneumovirus growing in infected cell cultures (van den Hoogen et al., 2001).

In order to identify viral genomes in any given biological sample, it is necessary to use methods that exclude cellular nucleic acids, which are the most abundant nucleic acids in most samples. The approach described here is based on physical separation of viral and cellular nucleic acids, followed by non-specific amplification of the purified viral nucleic acids. Encapsidation of viral nucleic acids is used as a basis for separation of viral nucleic acids from cellular nucleic acids. Viral capsids protect viral nucleic acids from digestion by nucleases, and also provide viral nucleic acids with a density that permits capsids to be separated from other cellular debris, including nucleic acids (Denniston et al., 1981). After purification of viral capsids, viral DNA and RNA are extracted (separately, in order to preserve an indication of whether a viral genome is DNA or RNA) and RNA is copied into cDNA by reverse transcription. Samples are then amplified using a non-specific DOP-PCR assay that is designed to amplify at least a portion of any viral genome. This report discusses this method and an evaluation of its sensitivity to detect viruses spiked into cell culture, present during acute infection of cell culture, or expressed constitutively in cell culture.",

Thus, to adapt this method for amplification of viral genomes, primers with shorter 3\u2032-anchor sequences were designed and tested (Table 1). Primer qualifying experiments were carried out using a 10-fold dilution series of the 5.2 kb SV40 genome, in order to compare the sensitivity of different primer populations. These experiments focused on variations of 3\u2032-anchor sequences TGTGG (primer #s 2\u201312) and TTCTG (primer #s 14\u201317), to increase the number of locations at which an anchor sequence is likely to bind to viral nucleic acid. Inosines were added at different locations of the degenerate portion of the primers in an effort to further improve binding at the 3\u2032 end of the primer (primer #s 2\u201317). In experiments using a 3\u2032-anchor sequence of four nucleotides (primer #s 3\u20136, 8, 9, 11, 14\u201317), sensitivity to detect DNA templates was reduced, probably because the primer length that matched the DNA template at its 3\u2032 end was too short (even when combined with the 6-nucleotide degenerate sequence or with additional inosines). Sequencing of DOP-PCR products and comparison with original template sequences revealed that this method typically amplifies genome fragments that match the 3\u2032-anchor sequence on opposite strands at both ends (with occasional mismatches), and that nucleotide matches upstream of the degenerate sequence are not required for efficient amplification (with only random [a median of 2 matches in the original viral sequence out of ten nucleotides] typically observed in this region, regardless of template). Use of different 10-nucleotide sequences did not influence sensitivity (primer #s 13 and 14), further supporting the conclusion that the 5\u2032-sequence does not play a role in DOP-PCR primer sensitivity. The best sensitivity was obtained with a 5-nucleotide 3\u2032-anchor sequence, in combination with one additional inosine inserted upstream of the degenerate sequence (primer #2). Consequently, an optimized primer population with these features was used in the virus detection experiments described in this manuscript.",

Adapter ligation PCR (Fig. 1, lower panels) detected 109 copies (but not lower quantities) of both viral DNAs, implying a substantial advantage to amplification of viral genomes by DOP-PCR.

Because non-encapsidated viral nucleic acid is removed in the process of purification and thus not amplified, some potential sensitivity is lost. The ratio between infectious virions and total virus nucleic acid may vary for different viruses and is determined not only by viral but also by host factors. In samples with low PFU to nucleic acid ratios, capsid purification could substantially reduce the ability to detect viral nucleic acids. However, in the SV40 experiment (Fig. 2), capsid purification yielded a 3-log improvement in DOP-PCR assay sensitivity, while reducing total viral DNA by approximately one log. Although it seems likely that the purification techniques described above would be applicable to other types of samples, caution should be used in extrapolating these results to samples that may have higher PFU to nucleic acid ratios, or that may be more complex and thus interfere either with the capsid purification or the DOP-PCR. Additional validation of the capsid purification may thus be necessary to extend this method to other sample types.",

Another advantage is the lack of need for a matched negative control (to perform molecular subtractions). A third advantage is the ability to handle very large samples; the elimination of cellular nucleic acids permits the concentration of viral nucleic acids to levels that would not be possible if cellular nucleic acids were retained. This advantage mitigates the somewhat reduced sensitivity of DOP-PCR relative to traditional PCRs, and also can compensate for the potential loss of non-encapsidated viral nucleic acid during the capsid preparation.",

PCR-assays using such primers were found to be sensitive (able to detect as few as 100 copies of viral nucleic acid for large virus genomes, and 100\u20131000 copies of viral nucleic acid for small genomes). The specific 3\u2032-anchor sequence of the primer population led to a reproducible amplification pattern for each virus. Thus, the pattern of bands observed in DOP-PCR may provide some preliminary clues to the virus sequences present in a sample. When contaminating cellular nucleic acids are incompletely degraded (while the virus nucleic acids are still protected by the capsid), we hypothesize that the use of a 3\u2032-anchor sequence may minimize the random amplification of very small cellular sequences (which are seldom long enough to contain two copies of the 3\u2032-anchor sequence on opposite strands), helping to explain the absence of cellular nucleic acid amplification in the assay.",

While specific PCRs result in false positives only if contaminating sequences that share significant homology with the used primers are present, false positive DOP-PCR products could stem from every conceivable form of nucleic acid contamination. Such contamination could not only cause delays in detection and more sequencing but could also camouflage virus sequences. In some early experiments, spurious sequences were detected due to reagent contamination with small amounts of bacterial, fungal, or algal nucleic acids, sometimes caused by residual contaminants in polymerases. However, the use of low-DNA Taq polymerase, and careful attention to the quality of other reagents minimized these problems.",

In its current form, the method seems most likely to be applicable to samples like serum or body fluids. Although implementation of the DOP-PCR for tissue or environmental samples will require additional work and validation, this assay is able to detect viruses of very different natures, including enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, viruses with DNA or RNA genomes, with small or large genomes, and even a segmented genome, without any specific prior knowledge regarding the sequence of the genome. The non-specific amplification method described here could also be paired with other virus nucleic acid purification techniques. There is potential utility of this method for virus detection and discovery, particularly in cases where other methods are unsuccessful in identifying viruses.",
