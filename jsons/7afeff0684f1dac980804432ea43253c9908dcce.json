There are various reasons for the containment of the disease in China, yet the evidence of role played by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) cannot be overlooked [9, 10] . This is now known that during the peak days of the epidemic, over 3100 TCM related workforce had been deployed to Hubei province [9] . TCM was officially included in the Chinese Guideline on diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 [11] . This is exceptionally important to note that specific TCM wards were set up, and designated hospital were established which had used a variety of Chinese medicines utilising their own principle of syndrome differentiation in conjunction with treatment employing western medicine. Total numbers of confirmed cases treated by TCM are reported to be at least 60,107 [12] . In coherence with the success of TCM in managing a communicable pandemic, it is logical and essential to explore how Ayurveda can help in addressing the COVID-19 challenge [13, 14] . Indeed, this is the time to mainstreaming the AYUSH systems to transform Indian healthcare [15] and demonstrate the potential of AYUSH systems in addressing the challenge and restoring health [16] . An understanding of COVID-19 epidemiology and pathogenesis as learned through on-going pandemic may help us drawing a feasible plan of action. About 80% of COVID-19 cases present with mild symptoms requiring only primary medical care. Of the rest 20% cases 15% require urgent medical attention at secondary health care services.",

These apparently healthy people may be the most suitable for building of immunity so that infection-related pathogenesis can be countered to keep them healthy [24] . Preventive interventions here can include both pharmacological as well as non-pharmacological strategies. Among the non-pharmacological interventions healthy lifestyles, adequate physical activity, sufficient sleep, care of retainable and non-retainable urges, sadvritta, and avoidance and isolation from infected persons are vital [25] . Fumigation of homes, shelters and living-place by Ayurvedic herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) peel, turmeric (Curcuma longa) powder, Carom or Ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi) seeds and Loban (resin of Styrax benzoin and Boswellia species) may also be a useful strategy for disinfection [26] . In addition, community based Swarna Prashana [27] and mass prophylaxis through rasayana having the predominant effects upon respiratory tract can be useful [28] . Rasayana may include Brahma Rasayana, Chyavanprasha or Amrit Bhallataka [29, 30] . The rationale for choice of rasayana drugs can be traced back to Samhita classics of Ayurveda as well as in contemporary research [14] . Rasayana act as antioxidant, anti-stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, vaccine adjuvant, and confer immunity against diseases [31, 32] . Further, according to Ayurveda classics, rasayana therapy [33] , along with physical and social distancing from infected persons [34] , constitute a core strategy to overcome epidemic and infectious diseases. Building immunity requires time. There may be some asymptomatic carriers who could transmit the virus to other apparently healthy people. Hence, physical and social distancing for all would be essential to avoid any transmission [34] .",

Indeed, with adequate monitoring and data keeping during the implementation, important lessons and research directions are likely to emerge on the management of increasingly frequent and virulent communicable diseases. Implementation of proposed action is likely to provide evidencebased insights strengthening the scope of Ayurveda beyond preventive health care and care for non-communicable diseases. AYUSH system across the country has been put on alert for being called anytime to serve the nation. AYUSH healthcare facilities are also being readied to be converted into quarantine facilities in times of need. From this perspective, implementing the suggested intervention plan within AYUSH healthcare facilities by Ayurveda workforce may benefit the nation greatly.
