However, these compounds easily undergo elimination reaction in the presence of Lewis acid. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the reaction indicated that four products are formed. The two more mobile compounds were separated by column chromatography, and shown by 1H NMR to be the desired products, 7a and 7b. The anomeric configuration of the compounds 7a and 7b was deduced from the 1H NMR coupling constants and confirmed where appropriate by Noediff experiments. In this way, compound 7b was shown to be the \u03b1-anomer mainly on the basis of the small long-range coupling of 1.3 Hz between H-1\u2032 and H-3\u2032, pointing to a W-coupling path between these two protons. This can happen only when both protons are equatorial and thus cis-oriented, and therefore only possible in the \u03b1-anomer. The rather high coupling constant J\n2\u2032,3\u2032=7.9 Hz in the other isomer 7a, which has thus the \u03b2-configuration, can be rationalized by the adoption of a more boat-like conformation of this six-membered lactam ring. This also explains the absence of a large J\n1\u2032,2\u2032 coupling between these two trans-oriented protons.",

            "text": "The structure of compounds 1a, 1b was unambiguously assigned using a combination of NMR techniques (H,H-COSY, H,C-HSQC, and H,C-HMBC). Compound 1b shows a large 1H NMR coupling constant (J=8.0 Hz), which is typical for a trans di-axial relationship between H-1\u2032 and H-2\u2032. This implies a \u03b2-configuration. Compound 1a is then the \u03b1-anomer having a slightly distorted half-chair conformation and resulting in an increased coupling constant between H-2\u2032 and H-3\u2032 (J\n2\u2032,3\u2032=5.5 Hz), and the disappearance of the long-range H-1\u2032/H-3\u2032 W-coupling. Noediff at H-1\u2032 gave a significant signal increase only for H-2\u2032, and thus confirms the C-1\u2032 conformation and at the same time the \u03b1-configuration of 1a. In the same way, we characterized compounds 2a and 2b and also the protected derivatives 10a, 10b, and 11a, 11b, since they all showed very similar 1H-couplings as in 1a and 1b. Compound 1a is the more mobile one on TLC of the two diastereoisomers. Normally we had expected that the presence of the 2\u2032-O-acetyl group would direct sugar\u2013base condensation reaction in the direction of the \u03b2-anomer via intermediate 12 (Fig. 2\n). Apparently, this is not the sole mechanism as a considerable amount of the \u03b1-anomer is formed. The N-Me group may participate in the reaction mechanism analogous to the condensation reaction of N-methyloxycarbonyl protected pyrrolidine and nucleobase via the formation of an iminium ion (13).26 The infrared absorption of compound 7a (1694 cm\u22121) is situated at somewhat higher wavelength than that of N-methyl-\u03b1-piperidone (1669 cm\u22121), which may indicate lesser amide resonance.27, 28, 29 This suggests that the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom of the cyclic amide (7a and 7b) can be involved in the mechanism of sugar\u2013base condensation reaction.",
