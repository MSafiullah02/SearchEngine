Very large epidemics associated with the widespread circulation of genetically novel influenza viruses, so-called pandemics, are caused only by influenza viruses of a single type (type A). Influenza (flu) virus, a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae is a segmented single-stranded RNA virus which exists in three types, A, B and C. Only types A and B cause disease of any consequence in humans. The genomes of both A and B viruses are comprised of eight gene segments which code for eleven viral proteins. Ten of these are functionally similar. The NB protein is unique to B viruses and the recently discovered PB1-F2 protein is found only in A viruses (Chen et al., 2001; McCullers et al., 2004; Steinhauer and Skehel, 2002).",

            "text": "Two of these proteins, hemaglutinnin (HA) coded for by the gene segment conventionally labeled #4, and neuraminidase (NA), coded for by the segment labeled #6, appear on the surface of the influenza virion, and are responsible for the greater portion of the immune response in humans. All B-type influenza viruses share variants of the same HA and NA proteins. The 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_5322 for A and B type viruses are similar in children (McCullers et al., 2004); but the overall clinical attack rate is much lower in epidemics of B-type than A-type viruses. In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that mortality associated with influenza B epidemics has declined about linearly over the most recent 40 years (Reichert et al., 2007). This difference in epidemiology suggests that the circulation of influenza B viruses in human populations is determined by population-based immunity. Reassortment(10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_5714) among human influenza B viruses is believed to be the genetic basis for sporadic increases in observed attack rates for B-viruses (McCullers et al., 2004). A-type viruses, however, exhibit another dimension of genetic complexity. A-type viruses circulate not only in humans but in many non-human reservoirs, most notably aquatic birds. The sudden appearance in A-type viruses responsible for human influenza infections of one or more gene segments from influenza viruses that previously circulated only in non-human reservoirs produces chimeric influenza viruses that are sufficiently immunologically novel that very widespread illness and injury occurs among humans. It is also possible that a virus that previously circulated only in a non-human reservoir could mutate sufficiently that it becomes de novo capable both of producing disease in humans and being widely transmissible among humans. Such a virus is maximally different from previous human immunological experience (all gene segments are novel) and potentially could produce the most severe pandemics. Those newly emergent viruses whose genomes are comprised of a substitution of only some of the gene segments of viruses that previously circulated in humans are thought to have arisen via reassortment during dual infections involving both a non-human and human influenza virus. The appearance of an influenza virus with a substituted gene segment is called 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_5107 (Hall et al., 1973; Monto and Kioumehr, 1975; Reichert et al., 2007).",

Because these two proteins are found on the surface of the virion, influenza has long been typed by reference to these two antigens. Only three HA subtypes and two versions of NA have been found in viruses that have circulated widely in humans. Pandemics of the twentieth century and their dates of emergence in the northern/southern hemispheres were caused by viruses of type H1N1 (1918/1918), H2N2 (1957/1958), and H3N2 (1968/1969). The 1918\u20131919 pandemic virus emerged en bloc as an avian virus the mutation and adaptation of which permitted replication in and transmission among humans (Taubenberger et al., 2005; Tumpey et al., 2005; Webster et al., 1992). The 1957 pandemic H2N2 virus emerged with substitutions of the HA, NA and PB1 gene segments into the evolved H1N1 viruses from an avian virus. The 1968 pandemic (H3N2) resulted from reassortments of the same avian sequences into multiple lineages of the evolved H2N2 viruses resulting in substitutions of HA and PB1 genes (Lindstrom et al., 2004). In each of the twentieth century pandemics, therefore, both the HA and the PB1 genes were substituted. The nomenclature for distinguishing immunologically and epidemiologically important influenza A-type viruses is, therefore, incomplete.",

Therefore, the only A-type influenza viruses not circulating at present are those with hemagglutinin of type 2, H2. In this context, we are all spectators to the brush with emergence of influenza A viruses of type H5N1 including a unique-to-human-experience PB1 gene, which is widely extant in the avian reservoir, causing massive disease in domestic poultry with a sporadic history of infecting small numbers of heavily exposed humans.

This approach of excess mortality was later applied by Serfling in 1963 and various modifications of this approach are now widely used (Serfling, 1963). Based on the excess criteria, an epidemic occurs when the number of disease cases (mortality) exceeds the number expected. However, defining the term epidemic may differ mildly. For instance, the US denotes an epidemic threshold for mortality based on estimated of the expected number of deaths given in a particular week accompanied by 95% confidence intervals around the projected estimate. With this approach, an epidemic is reported when the upper 95% confidence interval is exceeded.",

However, over the following decade total excess mortality has dropped to 1/3 that level and the fraction of the remainder attributable P&I dropped by 30%. Currently, this fraction has dropped to below 10% making the evaluation of flu-related burden a more challenging task. The burden associated with flu has been typically evaluated by a criterion that uses deaths recorded by physicians as caused by pneumonia and influenza (P&I) along with other measures such as influenza-like-illness (ILI). Excess mortality due to flu is calculated by estimating a baseline of deaths that would be expected in the absence of flu virus activity, and the number of deaths actually observed. This criterion, however, is not very sensitive as it fails to evaluate flu-related deaths that could have occurred outside the specified flu season or that could have been missed since several other diseases exhibit flu-like symptoms. Although P&I data has been widely used to evaluate excess mortality, it seems to account for about 25% of all flu related deaths; this suggests that estimates based on P&I may not be appropriate to measure the total impact of influenza on mortality (Simonsen et al., 1997). Further efforts aimed to improve excess mortality estimates due to flu have used 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_5070 data instead.",

Individuals of age less than 65 had a 57% of all-flu-related hospitalizations, however the average seasonal risk of flu-related P&I hospitalization was significantly higher for this risk group. Further modifications of the Serfling model have been implemented. Thomson et al. proposed a Poisson regression model to predict excess cases of P&I during influenza epidemics (1979\u20132001). This study reported significant influenza-related hospitalizations among elderly (50\u201364 years) and children younger than 5 years old (Thompson et al., 2003). Their findings showed that a yearly average of 133,900 cases listed as P&I hospitalizations were actually associated with the flu virus. A more recent study implemented a Poisson extension of the seasonal type model to predict excess cases of P&I during 16 seasons of flu epidemics in France (Denoeud et al., 2007). This study showed that morbidity data (flu-like-illness and virological data) may be used to predict excess P&I. The implications of this study provide a real possibility of flu-related burden for countries in which specific pneumonia and flu mortality surveillance data is simply not available.",

Singapore\u2019s yearly clinical infection from seasonal include are estimated at 20% (Ng et al., 2002). In a recent study, Lee et al. (Lee et al., 2007) implemented a linear regression model to evaluate the excess mortality due to flu pandemics of the last century. The authors estimated an excess 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_6136 of 7.76 per 1,000 people during May\u2013June and October\u2013November of 1918. Using a similar approach (Murray et al., 2006) these estimates reached a rate of 18 per 1,000 people. Estimates of monthly excess mortality for the 1957 pandemic yield 0.47 per 1,000 people (mid May). Although excess mortality during the1968 pandemic seems mild when compared the 1918 and 1957 outbreaks, this pandemic exhibited two waves. The first wave occurred in mid August with estimated monthly excess mortality of 0.27 per 1,000 people (543 deaths in a population of 2,012,000). Excess deaths peaked again in May\u2013June of 1970 and with an estimated excess mortally in the order of 0.15 per 1,000 people (309 deaths in a population of 2,074,500). Most significantly, this study showed that excess mortality estimates in Singapore are comparable, if not, higher than those observed in temperate regions. Their 1918 pandemic estimate of 1.80% (18 deaths in 1,000 people) exceeds global estimates of 1.06% and Taiwan\u2019s rate of 1.44% (Murray et al., 2006). Based on the findings in Lee et al. and studies referenced therein, Table\n81\u20101 summarizes the burden of flu in the 1918\u20131919 pandemic and it illustrates that tropical (sub-tropical) countries were affected more significantly than regions with temperate climates. These findings show that Kenya was the most affected country with an upper bound mortality rate estimate of 57.8%. Furthermore, four of the five highest affected countries corresponded to countries with tropical-subtropical climates.\n",

In addition to their risk to others, the inexperience immune system of children enhances their risk of developing complications from an infection.

A prospective surveillance study (1974\u20131999) of 1665 healthy children younger than 5 years showed annual infection ranging between 15 and 42% (Neutzil et al., 2002). It was further shown that children younger than 2-year of age were more likely than older children to have serious complications such as pneumonia, croup, chonchiolitis and sepsis (Neutzil et al., 2002). A study assessing age-associated burden of flu in epidemic and pandemic periods showed that half of flu-related deaths during the 1968\u20131969, with larger proportions of those 1957\u20131958 and 1918\u20131919 were attributed to people younger than 65 years of age. This study further showed that the high number of cases observed in these pandemics decrease significantly in prospective outbreaks. More particularly, they found that after each pandemic, the absolute risk of flu-related mortality among people younger than 65 decreased from 7- to 28-fold over the following decade during severe epidemics. In contrast, the corresponding risk reductions among those people older than 65 years of age range from 2- to 3-fold or less (Simonsen et al., 1998). A multiple source data study of the UK during 1995\u20131999 showed that on average 10% of children contract clinical influenza while a further 20% may be asymptomatic for children younger than 5 years old (Watkins, 2004). While vaccination is the optimal choice for protecting young age children, and thereby, reducing the burden of flu in this group, it has also been shown that the risk to other members of the population can be reduced through children vaccination. Ahmed et al. showed that vaccinating young age children improved community level protection (Ahmed et al., 2001).",

Under this program, vaccination levels reached 80%. Figure\n81\u20102 illustrates decreasing mortality trends from all-cause and pneumonia related mortalities. However, this figure also shows that as soon as vaccination measures were relaxed in 1987, flu-related mortality increased.

However, the highest risk of hospitalization occurs among infants (younger than 1 year) and the elderly (older than 65 years). Estimates of 90% of cases attributed to flu occur among the elderly. Although flu is not typically reported as the cause for hospitalization, it is most certainly a disease that sets the stage for the complication of other diseases such as pneumonia and chronic illness.

This quantity measures the average number of secondary cases of infection generated by one primary case in a fully susceptible population. R0 is composed of three contributions: the susceptible population available to have contact with a primary case (S0), the length of time (D) the primary case is infectious to others (window of opportunity for infection), and the transmission coefficient \u03b2 (rate of effective mixing). Together this yields the following formula: R0= \u03b2 D S0. A value of R0 equal to one or below defines a transmission threshold under which the generation of new cases is insufficient to support spread of disease within a community. However, R0 greater than one indicates that the infection will be able to spread in a population. A larger value of R0 suggests the possibility of a more severe pandemic outbreak.

A recent study reported the findings from three groups (UW/LANL, Imperial/Pitt and VBI group) that implemented individual-based stochastic simulation models to evaluate the effectiveness of a set of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing the burden of a potential pandemic influenza (Halloran et al., 2008). Comparisons were based on the simulation of a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago (approximately 3.6 million people). These simulations considered the following interventions: antiviral treatment and household 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_5962 of identified cases, prophylaxis and 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_6505 of household contacts, closure of school, social distancing measures implemented in the workplace and the overall community. This study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of these measures as projected by each of the individual-based stochastic simulation models and to assess the robustness of these results to the model assumptions. The results from these three simulation models produced similar effectiveness of the interventions evaluated. More particularly, this study showed that the timely intervention of these measures reduces the final number of flu illness, for pandemics of moderate severity; all models show that NPIs are highly effective. Moreover, school closure is predicted to be highly important in all three model simulations. This study showed that under the levels of compliance (30\u201390%) and ascertainment (60\u201380%) assumed in these simulations, that it is quite possible to mitigate a pandemic, at least until a vaccine becomes available. The implications of these studies suggest possible routes that may be used to ameliorate the burden of a potential pandemic. However, the uncertainty involved ascertainment and compliance of cases is likely to play a significant role in the effectiveness of the proposed social distancing and targeted measures.",

Although vaccine is the optimal approach at curtailing a flu pandemic, antivirals (therapeutic and prophylaxis) are likely to play an important role in reducing the burden. The use of multiple pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the burden of disease associated with a pandemic was evaluated in several studies (Ferguson et al., 2005; Germann et al., 2006, Longini et al., 2004, Longini et al., 2005). Choosing a plan that includes massive stockpiling of antivirals, targeted antiviral prophylaxis, massive pre-vaccination of high-risk individuals or a combination of any of these involves various levels of uncertainty and complexity. The foremost important factor in determining the approach to be implemented is to determine the level of resources available at the time that a pandemic virus emerges. Next, one must consider the potential complications that involve the use of antivirals. For example, should they be implemented as treatment or prophylaxis? Which of these two approaches is more economically efficient and likely to provide higher levels of community protection? Are there any implications of viral resistance with the use of antiviral treatment versus prophylaxis?",

These efforts include pharmaceutical interventions such as antiviral treatment and vaccine and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, closing of public gatherings. To this end, several studies have been proposed to evaluate the role of these various interventions in minimizing the risk of a potential pandemic. A recent study assessed the current preparedness plans in the US, UK and the Netherlands and simulated single as well as combined intervention strategies during a pandemic (Nu\u00f1o et al., 2007). The interventions proposed in this study included vaccine, antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, and basic hospital and community level transmission control measures. This study showed that while vaccine was optimal in reducing the burden during a pandemic, antiviral and basic control measures can be highly effective. The main findings in this study showed that the \u201coptimal\u201d plan for a particular country is contingent upon the resources available. That is, in countries with limited pharmaceutical interventions, the use of antivirals as treatment was preferred over prophylaxis. Moreover, in countries with little or no access to a vaccine or antivirals, the benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as basic transmission control measures can be highly effective in reducing the burden due to influenza. This study proposed that the implementation of social behavioral measures that could effectively reduce a person\u2019s risk of infection were significant in reducing the burden of disease.",

As discussed, there are several challenges involved in evaluating the accurate burden of flu; the non-specific nature of the illness typically lends itself for an incomplete confirmation of cases that is likely to be attributed to the flu virus. For instance, it is possible that a person may experience an infection without the presence of symptoms and therefore escape surveillance systems. It is also possible that those infected individuals develop symptoms but choose to be cared for at home and therefore do not report to a clinic or hospital. Aside from the challenges involved in the surveillance and timely collection of data, this study emphasized that current methods for evaluating the burden of influenza are applicable in some cases to countries with temperate climates. A summary of the burden in tropical and subtropical regions of the world showed that in fact, the burden of flu has been highly underestimated. These findings suggest that an effective preparedness plan should be based on a global and accurate assessment of the burden. That is, building a capacity (pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions) that is aimed at reducing the burden of developed and developing countries is essential for the well-being of communities worldwide.",

A recent study showed that the benefits of antivirals during a flu pandemic are likely to be reduced by the presence of drug resistance (Lipsitch et al., 2007). As suggested in the evaluation of single and combined intervention plans for the US, UK and the Netherlands, Nu\u00f1o et al. showed that the strategy of implementing antivirals in treatment or as prophylaxis will strongly depend on the level of resources available (Nu\u00f1o et al., 2007). Countries with limited resources should opt for treatment rather than prophylaxis. An overwhelming conclusion from the studies that have evaluated various forms of interventions to curtail pandemic flu is that vaccine is clearly the optimal choice. However, there are practical limitations with the use of a vaccine. Foremost importantly, vaccine is unlikely to be available at the time a pandemic virus emerges in humans, as current methods for developing a flu vaccine require several months. Once a vaccine becomes available, it is uncertain how many doses each person would require for protection. With current manufacturing capabilities only about one third of the US population is likely to have access to a vaccine. Unfortunately, the level of resources that may be available for developing countries is likely to be much lower than the US and other developed parts of the world.",

The main challenge includes the uncertainty involved with the use of antivirals, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Among the interventions that are likely to be readily available at the time of pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) will play an essential role in slowing the progression of an outbreak. However, the success of a NPI-based approach will likely be conditional on its timely and continuous implementation throughout the entire pandemic period (Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007; Hatchett et al., 2007; Markel et al., 2006; Markel et al., 2007). Early relaxation of these measures could further magnify the spread of a pandemic and yield devastating levels of morbidity and mortality. An optimal plan for preparing against a prospective flu pandemic is contingent upon the availability of pharmaceutical resources, its potential complications and the social demands that non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, closing of public gathering will have in a society.",
