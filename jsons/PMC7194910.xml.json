At the time of writing, 78 630 cases had been reported in China and 3664 cases had been confirmed in 46 other countries (World Health Organization, 2020). Iran has recently become an epicenter in the Middle East region and has seen the largest cumulative number of deaths outside China (Wikipedia, 2020). As of March 1, 2020, Iran had confirmed 987 COVID-19 cases, including 54 associated deaths (Wikipedia, 2020). At least six neighboring countries (Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) had reported imported COVID-19 cases from Iran. Given the serious concerns over the under-ascertainment of COVID-19 cases in Iran (ABC News, 2020), the United Arab Emirates (UAE) along with other Gulf Cooperation Council countries suspended inbound and outbound flights from Iran on February 25, 2020 (Khaleej Times, 2020).",

(Imai et al., 2020), it was assumed that the number of cases (n) exported from Iran followed a binomial distribution with size N and probability p. Here, N represents the total number of cases infected in Iran, and p is the probability that one case is detected outside the country. We approximated p as the ratio of daily outbound passengers from Iran (D) over the total size of the population (M) that those airports serve and multiplying it by the mean duration (t) from exposure to detection; thus, p = D\u2219t/M. We set t at 10 days, based on the study by Imai et al. (Imai et al., 2020). It was assumed that the catchment population was the total population of Iran. The maximum likelihood estimate of the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran (\u03bb) was calculated by fitting the model to the number of confirmed cases with a binomial-distributed likelihood framework. As shown in Equation (1), the l(\u2219) represents the total log-likelihood and k is the total number of countries we selected. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the profile likelihood estimation approach determined by a Chi-square quantile.(1)l(\u03bb)= logL\u03bb=\u2211i=1klogfni,pi;\u03bb\n",
