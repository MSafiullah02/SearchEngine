Yet, social distancing at variable stringency level is likely to stay around for months or even years [4] . Thus, a more realistic goal should be minimizing the number of clinic visits and injections rather than withholding therapy. Cases where prolongation of treatment interval may be practiced more liberally may include eyes with diabetic macular oedema (DMO) or branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with minimal macular oedema in the last exam according to optical coherence tomography (OCT). In DMO, treat-and-extend regimen (TER) using increase intervals of 1 month was non inferior to pro-re-nata (PRN) protocol, but with 46% less visit [5] . Delaying IVI in retinal vein occlusion patients to PRN every 12 weeks resulted in visual loss in CRVO patients but not in BRVO patient [6] .",

If a patient answer yes to any of the questions, they should be encouraged to speak to their primary care provider and the injection visit should be delayed. If symptoms are severe, they should be sent to the Emergency Department of a hospital capable of handling COVID-19 [11] . Treatment of quarantined or SARS-CoV-2+ cases should be delayed at this time until the individual will become SARS-CoV-2 negative per to sequential PCR tests. Based on the shedding period of SARS-CoV-2 the delay in providing injection will likely last about 3 weeks or less [12] . Such delay is unlikely to result in substantial visual loss in most cases.
