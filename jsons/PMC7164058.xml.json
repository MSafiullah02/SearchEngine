The two peptides encompassing the N\u2010terminal and C\u2010terminal HRs of the NiV/HeV F protein assemble into a stable trimer of heterodimers [21]. The two\u2010helix molecules were prepared as a single chain by linking HR1 and HR2 with a linker (Fig. 1A). The NiV two\u2010helix forms crystals with unit cell parameters a = 31.7 \u00c5, b = 31.7 \u00c5, c = 51.3 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 80.7\u00b0, \u03b2 = 86.3\u00b0 and \u03b3 = 65.8, and belongs to the space group P1. The crystals contain three two\u2010helix molecules (one stable trimer) per asymmetric unit and diffract to 2.2 \u00c5.

Unless otherwise stated, we will concentrate on the structure of the NiV two\u2010helix in the following discussion. The fusion core of NiV has a rod\u2010shaped structure approximately 50 \u00c5 in length and with a maximum diameter of 28 \u00c5. The NiV two\u2010helix complex structure is a six\u2010helix bundle comprising a trimer of NiV two\u2010helix molecules. The center of this bundle consists of a parallel trimeric coiled coil formed by three HR1 helices, against which three HR2 helices pack in an antiparallel manner (Fig. 2A,B). The N\u2010terminus of HR1 and the C\u2010terminus of HR2 are located at the same end of the six\u2010helix bundle, placing the fusion peptide and transmembrane domains close together. A region of about 270 amino acids would be located at the other end of the six\u2010helix bundle between HR1 and HR2 in the postfusion state of NiV F protein.",

The HR2 helices interact with HR1 mainly through hydrophobic interactions between hydrophobic residues in HR2 and the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil (Fig. 3A). The interaction region of HR1 can be divided into three parts: the upper deep groove (I144\u2013V158), the central shallow groove (V159\u2013T164) and the lower deep groove (A165\u2013L172) (Fig. 3B). Residues M463, I474, L481 and V484 of HR2 are anchored in the deep groove of HR1 and make a significant contribution to the hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and HR2 (Fig. 3B). Sequence comparison between NiV/HeV and other paramyxovirus fusion proteins shows that residues contributing to the HR1\u2013HR2 interaction (e and g positions in HR1, a and d positions in HR2) are highly conserved (1, 3). This pattern of sequence conservation can also be shown by a helical wheel representation of one HR1 helix and one HR2 helix [21]. Sequence comparison between NiV and SV5 fusion proteins shows that five out of nine changes (including one A to V) occur in the e and g positions of HR1, and six out of nine changes (including two L to I and one I to V) occur in HR2 at the a and d positions. In contrast, only 13 out of 15 nonconservative changes occur at the outside f, b and c positions in HR1, and three out of 21 nonconservative changes occur at positions other than a and d in HR2 (Fig. 1B).",

Second, the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil have some significant differences, especially in the lower deep groove (Fig. 4C,D). In the structure of the NiV F fusion core, the lower deep groove formed by T164, A165, T168, V169 and L172 is much deeper than the equivalent region of the SV5 fusion core structure, formed by A157, T158, L161, G162 and V165 (Fig. 3E). This groove is so deep that we even observe that the bottom of the grooves are connected to each other and form a connective hole in the HR1 surface. Residue M463, which occupies the d position in the HR2 region and faces the center of the trimer, anchors into this groove and greatly contributes to the stability of the fusion core complex. Residue L161 in the SV5 structure makes this groove more shallow than its counterpart, T168, in NiV due to the longer hydrophobic side chain. Sequence alignment with other Paramyxoviridae viruses also shows that NiV has the shortest hydrophobic residue in the T168 position and the longest residue in the M463 position.",

Among the Paramyxoviridae, the NiV and HeV fusion cores have the shortest structures and sequences. However, all paramyxovirus fusion cores share the same core parts and are highly conserved, both in sequence (Fig. 1B) and in three\u2010dimensional structure (Fig. 3B). These facts suggest that the structure of the NiV F fusion core may share common features with all Paramyxoviridae virus fusion cores, leading us to propose the NiV F fusion core structure as a model for Paramyxoviridae fusion cores. Furthermore, the conserved deep grooves at both ends of the NiV fusion core may provide a structural basis for the design of wide\u2010spectrum therapeutics targeting the Paramyxoviridae family.",

            "text": "\n1Structural studies of the influenza virus HA and HIV gp41 have established a paradigm for understanding the mechanisms of viral and cellular membrane fusion [18]. The similarity between the NiV F protein and other widely studied viral fusion proteins, as well as previous biochemical analysis [38], indicates a similar mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by the NiV and HeV fusion proteins. The structures of the NiV and HeV fusion cores reported here add to the repertoire of paramyxovirus six\u2010helix bundle fusion core structures, providing greater structural information in order to understand the formation of the fusion\u2010active state of genus Henipavirus. Similar to SV5F and HIV gp41, the NiV and HeV fusion proteins probably undergo a series of conformational changes to become fusion\u2010active. The fusion loop, which inserts into the cellular membrane, is accepted to have the distinct conformational states proposed for the NiV F protein fusion core, including the native state, the prehairpin intermediate, and the fusion\u2010active hairpin state. Several biological and inhibition studies have also provided good evidence that the fusion core in the crystal structure presented here is the final, stable form of the protein, which is the fusion\u2010active state following one or more conformational changes. First, gel filtration and chemical crosslinking results demonstrated that the oligomeric state of the two\u2010helix protein was a trimer. Even at high concentrations of the crosslinker, the monomer/dimer bands could be observed [31]. Second, NiV and HeV infection in vitro can be potently blocked by peptides corresponding to the C\u2010terminal HR (HR2) of the HeV fusion envelope glycoprotein 39. These features suggest that the NiV F protein also undergoes a conformational change mechanism, similar to influenza HA and HIV gp41.\n",

            "text": "As membrane fusion is a very important process during virus infection, inhibition studies have been carried out to find effective drugs to block virus infection by targeting the membrane fusion step. In the case of HIV\u20101, several strategies to block hairpin formation have been successfully developed to identify viral entry inhibitors that bind to the hydrophobic pocket and grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil consisting of HIV\u20101 gp41 N peptides. These useful viral entry inhibitors include D peptides, five\u2010helix, and synthetic peptides derived from N or C peptides [40, 41, 42]. Successful viral entry inhibitors have also been identified for other viruses, such as T20 for HIV\u20101 and GP610 for Ebola virus. Analogous strategies could also be used for the design of NiV/HeV fusion inhibitors.",

The applied chemical modifications are also predicted to increase the serum half\u2010life in vivo and should increase the chances of success in the development of an effective antiviral therapy [50]. The well\u2010defined hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil of the NiV F protein fusion core identified from our structure can offer a reasonable explanation for the inhibition of NiV and HeV infection.
