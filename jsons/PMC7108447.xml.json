            "text": "Meetings have been held on taeniasis/cysticercosis or echinococcosis in many international conferences or congresses, but they are usually organized separately. Therefore, we have few chances to discuss both taeniasis/cysticercosis and echinococcosis together at the same meetings. The first combined meeting was organized in 1982 in Czechoslovakia [1]. The meeting was simultaneously the venue for preparation of the first WHO Guidelines for Surveillance, Prevention and Control of Taeniasis/Cysticercosis [2] when Drs. Z. Matyas and Z. Pawlowski from WHO invited contributors and advisors for preparation of the guidelines, including Prof. Lord E.J.L. Soulsby, the late Prof. J.D. Smyth, and Dr. M.A. Gemmell and many other active researchers. These guidelines were updated in 2005 [3]. A second international symposium was held in Czechoslovakia in 1985. Here a Russian group reported on Taenia saginata from brains of reindeer but not cattle [4]. Was this real T. saginata? This has still not been confirmed by molecular typing. It is now known that in Southeast Asia, there are two sister-species, T. saginata and Taenia asiatica which can be differentiated by molecular analysis but not by macroscopic morphology [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. It is essential to analyze the mitochondrial DNA of such specimens from taeniasis patients. In 1986, the 3rd International Cestode Symposium organized by Dr. Mike Rickard was held at the University of Melbourne, Australia. At that meeting, many of the senior scientists, who attended the Asahikawa symposium, met for the first time.",

Craig, University of Salford (UK) started an international collaboration project in 1987 on the epidemiology of echinococcosis in Gansu and Xinjiang with the support from the Wellcome Trust and the European Commission [12]. Prof. F Andersen [13] and Dr. P.M. Schantz carried out pilot control projects in Xinjiang funded by the Thrasher Foundation [14]. In 1997 Dr. D.D. Heath started a New Zealand\u2013China bilateral project for control of cystic echinococcosis in domestic animals in Tibetan area of Sichuan province [15]. Because the author (Prof. A. Ito) was involved in these projects primarily for serological analyses, he organized a small but functional international workshop entitled \u201cTowards multilateral collaboration and cooperation for the control of echinococcosis, cysticercosis and other parasitic zoonoses in western China\u201d in Chengdu, China in July 2000 [16]. The late Dr. C. Urbani from WHO-Hanoi, who discovered the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Vietnam and died of SARS on 29 March 2003, attended this Chengdu meeting as his first official job at WHO-Hanoi. In September 2000, P.S. Craig and Z.S. Pawlowski organized an international symposium on echinococcosis and cysticercosis in Poznan (Poland) as a NATO Scientific meeting [17]. Ito and Urbani also organized an international symposium on cysticercosis at the Third International Seminar on Food-Borne Parasitic Zoonoses in December 2000 [18]. Urbani was keen to investigate the prevention and control of cysticercosis and echinococcosis in Vietnam and other neighboring countries and invited Ito and Craig to be consultants to WHO-Hanoi for cestode zoonoses in Vietnam, however, he unfortunately passed away before this could be initiated [16].",
