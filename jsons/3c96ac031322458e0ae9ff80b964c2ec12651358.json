But what should have been excitement in the air was displaced ongoing anxiety over COVID-19. Less than a week after breaking stories of overrun hospitals in Italy, the virus had reached the east coast of the United States and our patients were showing signs of fever and respiratory compromise. As a surgeon, I didn't realize, how this might affect my practice, but as the hours ticked by it became clear that surgical practice as we knew it was changing. [1] [2] [3] In surgical training, we are taught many things. Among these, the abdominal surgical exam, sets us apart from our non-surgical colleagues. On rounds, \"every wound, every day\" is what we practice and what we preach. The act of placing handsfeelingand connecting, with patient wounds has special meaning for us. Surgeons heal through touch.",

Nervous humor was used to build team trust. We all knew we were susceptible to contracting the virus and passing it along to our patients. We knew that patients all around the world were dying, and that nearly 200,000 people had already contracted it. Perhaps more anxiety provoking was what we didn't know. Because of the lack of diagnostic testing, we had limited ability to determine who was positive and who was negative. In 2020, when blood tests are simply ordered in the computer, seamlessly collected, magically resulted, and acted upon, our inability to determine who was sick and who was not added perceived distance between patient and diagnosis. We were all proud to be on the unit, but reasonably fearful for the patients, for our healthcare colleagues, and for ourselves.",

The mesh had become infected after about 3 weeks and he had been taken to the OR for a washout, after which he had begun to recover quite nicely. A week later, and otherwise nearing discharge, he had a fever. Then he was placed on oxygen, tachypneic. This all developed in the 24 hours before we rounded on him. He was transferred to the BCTsomething I had not yet heard of. This was the biocontainment triage unit. The BCT -it was where the \"COVID rule outs\" went.",

There was new, unfamiliar signage everywhere and clipboards hung from makeshift barriers, presumably to document the comings and goings of care providers on the unit. In the first room, I could see two astronaut-like ICU team members sewing in a newly placed subclavian line. The BCT was sterile, with no smell. It was quiet. Eerily quiet for an ICU. There was no sound because behind the closed glass doors of the patient rooms were additional all-white, plastic barriers separating the patient from the world. Cut into these white plastic barriers were clear plastic windows. One had to awkwardly adjust their neck to see through two sets of windows in order to get a glimpse of the patient.",

He was ours. Each day before his COVID rule out, we would see him, talk to him, and learn how he was improving. Every day, we would evaluate the well-appearing wound, as trained. Ceremonially, we examined the incision, commenting on the ever-improving quality of his tissues. Now in BCT, there were barriers between the surgeons and the patients. There were physical barriers, there were diagnostic barriers, and there were infectious barriers. Preparing to go see our hernia repair patient, I was forced to ask, \"do I need to see him?\" I shuttered as the thought zapped my brain, and answering my own question I internally responded, \"of course you do! After all, who else will look at his abdomen?\" That was that. Decision made.",

I could hear the patient clearly and articulately. I could see him and his wound. In a manner unfamiliar, the patient unceremoniously showed me his belly on the video monitor. In my mind, I gently pressed on it, pronouncing him well and validating his stay. But, this didn't happen. In reality, he was fine. His wound looked okay on the monitor. I asked him some questions about his abdomen, pain, and his comfort. We discussed that his oxygen level was improving at that he would soon be well enough to leave the ICU. We laughed a little. We smiled, and I reassured him he was in good hands.",
