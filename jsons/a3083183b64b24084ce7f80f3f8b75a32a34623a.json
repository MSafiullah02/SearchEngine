However, the differences in a viral infection pattern and clinical impacts of respiratory viruses between the two groups have not been well investigated. The clinical and microbiological data from COPD patients admitted with AE-COPD (n \u00bc 281) or CP-COPD (n \u00bc 284) between January 2010 and December 2012 were reviewed. After excluding 88 patients (40 with AE-COPD and 48 with CP-COPD) who did not undergo a multiplex RT-PCR test for respiratory viruses, the demographic characteristics, identified viruses, and clinical outcomes of the AE-COPD and CP-COPD groups were compared. Respiratory viruses were identified in 41.9% of AE-COPD group and 33.5% of the CP-COPD groups. The most common virus was influenza virus in the AE-COPD group (33.7%) versus human coronavirus (24.1%) in the CP-COPD group. Influenza virus was significantly more common in the AE-ACOPD group than in the CP-COPD group (P < 0.01). In-hospital mortality of AE-COPD and CP-COPD were 1.2% and 12.3%, respectively (P < 0.01). Among CP-COPD patients, in-hospital mortality of patients with only viral infection group, only bacterial infection group, and viral-bacterial co-infection were 2.6%, 25.8%, and 17.5%, respectively (P \u00bc 0.01). Respiratory viruses were commonly identified in both AE-COPD and CP-COPD, influenza virus and human coronavirus were the most common viruses identified in AE-COPD and CP-COPD patients, respectively. The mortality rates of only viral infection group was significantly lower than only bacterial infection or viralbacterial co-infection group in CP-COPD patients. J. Med.

Acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD) and concomitant pneumonia in COPD (CP-COPD) are two serious conditions that often complicate COPD [Wedzicha and Seemungal, 2007; Mullerova et al., 2012] . Respiratory viruses are a well-known cause of AE-COPD, which are responsible for 39-56% of AE-COPD [Seemungal et al., 2001; Rohde et al., 2003] . Recently, newly discovered respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus NL63 and HKU1, and bocavirus have been added as important causes of AE-COPD [Ringshausen et al., 2009; Kherad et al., 2010] . Also, with the development and application of technology to detect viral nucleic acid, the detection of respiratory viruses in AE-COPD has markedly improved [Mohan et al., 2010] .",

Excluding outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)coronavirus [Peiris et al., 2003] human coronavirus have never been regarded as a common cause of pneumonia. The presence of viruses in pneumonia patients does not necessarily mean that these viruses are the true pathogen of pneumonia. In our current study, of the 19 CP-COPD patients with human coronavirus infection, 12 (63.2%) had bacterial co-infection, including six with S. aureus and two with S. pneumoniae. A prior report showed that there was an increase in S. aureus acquisition during the SARS period [Yap et al., 2004] . Recently, a Polish group reported that human coronavirus NL63 increases the streptococcal adherence to respiratory epithelial cells [Golda et al., 2011] , and that human coronavirus NL63 infection is associated with an increase in platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-R) expression, which promotes adherence of S. pneumoniae. Our study supports the work by Golda et al. who saw the same events but in an in vitro assay. These finding suggests that human coronavirus infection might be associated with a risk of pneumonia development through bacterial coinfection in COPD patients. Further studies will be needed to confirm this result.",

Exposure to recent antibiotics during hospital stay might have influenced the type of pathogen, and more than 20% of CP-COPD events were hospital-acquired infections or health care associated pneumonia. The patients in the CP-COPD with S. aureus group received antibiotics more frequently than those in the other pathogen group (62.5% [15/24] vs. 11.0% [9/82], P < 0.01). In addition, previous studies performed in Korea showed that S. aureus and A. baumannii are important pathogens, particularly in HCAP and HAP patients (with ranges of 6.1-19.8% and 2.0-16.0%, respectively) [Choi et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2014] .",

We found that few investigators to date have compared the outcomes between AE-COPD and CP-COPD. Recently, a Spanish group compared the clinical outcomes between 133 AE-COPD patients and 116 CP-COPD patients [Huerta et al., 2013] . Similar to the results of our study, AE-COPD patients had a greater severity of disease than CP-COPD patients. However, in their results, in-hospital mortalities of AE-COPD group and CP-COPD group were 3.0% and 3.4%, respectively, which are quite different from those of our patients especially in the CP-COPD group (1.2% in the AE-COPD group and 12.3% in the CP-COPD group). We thought that these differences might reflect a different severities of illness in the two patient populations. The ICU admission rate of patients between two groups were different (in the Spanish study 3.8% in the AE-COPD group, 2.6% in the CP-COPD group versus 10.8% and 15.7% of the our studied patients in each). This difference might explain the outcome difference between the two groups.",

Notably, among our CP-COPD patients, only viral infection group had significantly better outcomes than the only bacterial infection group or the viral bacterial co-infection group. This finding suggests that when bacterial coinfection complicates viral infection, it can lead to poorer outcomes. However, according to a separate x 2 test, the mortality rates of patients with bacterial infection alone and virus-bacteria co-infection were not significantly different. Thus, it seems that the impact of viral infection on the mortality of CP-COPD patients with bacterial infection may not Because nearly all patients were tertiary referrals from other hospitals, the study population might not be representative of the general population. Third, the viruses identified by a sensitive RT-PCR could be bystanders, rather than causative pathogens. If other admitted patients who had neither AE-COPD nor CP-COPD were included as controls, we might indirectly be able to estimate the proportion of nonsignificant colonizers. However, this is not possible due to the retrospective design of the study. It was also difficult to establish a cause-effect relationship and it is not clear whether people developed AE-COPD or CP-COPD following infection. Fourth, our study did not include control patients with viral infection alone (without AE-COPD or CP-COPD) and it was, thus, difficult to determine the precise role of the virus in mortality due to AE-COPD or CP-COPD. Also, due to the retrospective nature of the study, some data were missing. For example, it was very difficult to obtain an accurate time of transfer from other hospitals and data of prior antibiotics use. Since we often did not know how long a patient was resident in the transferring hospital, we could not take this into account. Finally, since the number of each virus was relatively small, the characteristics of each viral infection could not be compared between the groups. In conclusion, respiratory viral infection is common to both AE-COPD and CP-COPD. However, the distribution of respiratory viruses involved was different between these two groups of patients. The clinical outcomes of CP-COPD patients with only viral infection were better than those with only bacterial infection or viral-bacterial co-infection. The factors associated with the clinical outcomes of CP-COPD patients included age and presence of bacterial infection. These findings warrant future studies of larger scale with appropriate control patients.",
