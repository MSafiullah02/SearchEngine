For quantitative determination of Bcl\u20102 protein expression, a western blot analysis was performed. OLN cells were incubated for 2 h with different concentrations of flupirtine (1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 \u03bcM), with TNF\u2010\u03b1 (500 U/ml) alone or a combination of both as described above. Cells without any treatment were used as controls. The Bcl\u20102 control protein migrated with a molecular mass of 26 kDa; each probe revealed a band of the correct size (\u223c26 kDa). Flupirtine alone caused a concentration\u2010dependent induction of Bcl\u20102 protein in OLN cells (Fig. 2a). Also, Bcl\u20102 protein was induced by TNF\u2010\u03b1 alone and even stronger after the combined treatment with TNF\u2010\u03b1 and flupirtine (Fig. 2b). Quantitative evaluation showed that 100 \u03bcM flupirtine caused an \u223c1.6\u2010fold increase in Bcl\u20102 expression. An almost 2.5\u2010fold Bcl\u20102 induction was observed after treatment with 500 U/ml TNF\u2010\u03b1. The strongest induction was seen after combined treatment with flupirtine (10 and 100 \u03bcM) and 500 U/ml TNF\u2010\u03b1, corresponding to an approximately threefold increase compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3). These data indicate that Bcl\u20102 expression in OLN cells was moderately induced by flupirtine. TNF\u2010\u03b1 alone led to strong Bcl\u20102 expression, which further increased during combined treatment with these substances.",

            "text": "Cell death is a key event in various different cell processes. Apoptosis as a physiological event has been shown to be one of the two important cell death mechanisms and is regulated by a wide range of different stimuli as well as proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes. The Fas/APO\u20101 (CD 95) system and the tumor suppressor gene p53 are typical members of the family of apoptosis\u2010inducing genes, whereas Bcl\u20102 is the prototype of an antiapoptotic protein. Bcl\u20102 inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell survival (Hockenbery et al., 1990; Vaux, 1998). The antiapoptotic activity is achieved by suppressing the apoptosis\u2010inducing function of Bax by forming heterodimers with the Bax protein (Oltvai et al., 1993). It has been shown that Bcl\u20102 up\u2010regulation in neurons reduces apoptosis during physiological cell death (Zanjani et al., 1996).",

            "text": "There is still considerable controversy on the role of apoptosis in the elimination of oligodendrocytes from demyelinating CNS lesions. Local TNF/p55TNF receptor signaling is capable of inducing oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination in transgenic mice (Akassoglou et al., 1998). After intracerebral infection of Lewis rats with JHM coronavirus, a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease is induced, which in many aspects mimics the pathology of MS. At later stages after infection, the virus antigen was nearly completely cleared from the lesions, and oligodendrocytes were mainly destroyed by apoptosis (Barac\u2010Latas et al., 1997). Similar observations were made in canine distemper virus demyelinating encephalitis (Schobesberger et al., 1999) as well as in an experimental model of myelin\u2010associated glycoprotein deficiency (Lassmann et al., 1997). In and around MS lesions, molecules belonging to the apoptotic cascade have been shown to be expressed by oligodendrocytes (Bonetti and Raine, 1997). Whether the expression of these molecules is associated with the presence of oligodendrocyte apoptosis, however, is still controversial (Lucchinetti et al., 1996; Bonetti and Raine, 1997; Dowling et al., 1997, 1999).",

            "text": "The fact that oligodendrocytes can be driven into apoptosis in vitro, in contrast, is undoubted, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 seems to play a critical role in this process (Selmaj and Raine, 1988; Selmaj et al., 1991). The protooncogene p53 induces oligodendrocyte death after induction by TNF\u2010\u03b1 (Eizenberg et al., 1996; Ladiwala et al., 1999), and TNF\u2010\u03b1 potentiates interferon\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced cell death in oligodendrocyte progenitors (Andrews et al., 1998). The final execution phase of TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced oligodendrocyte death seems to be mediated by the ICE/CED\u20103 family of caspases (Hisahara et al., 1997; Gu et al., 1999). In our study, flupirtine up\u2010regulated Bcl\u20102 when given in high concentrations (100 \u03bcM). The greatest increase in Bcl\u20102 protein was observed when TNF\u2010\u03b1 was applied in combination with 10 or 100 \u03bcM flupirtine. Flupirtine treatment protected oligodendrocytes from TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010mediated apoptosis. However, only the 100 \u03bcM concentration of flupirtine produced a highly significant reduction of oligodendrocyte apoptosis. This may be due to the fact that flupirtine does not selectively affect Bcl\u20102 protein expression, but also modifies other proteins of the apoptosis cascade. Besides up\u2010regulation of Bcl\u20102, flupirtine is known to decrease levels of ICH\u20101, which is caspase 2 (Osborne et al., 1997). It is interesting that caspase 2 and 3 expression was demonstrated in oligodendrocytes undergoing apoptosis (Gu et al., 1999). A recent study identified the inhibition of caspase 3 and up\u2010regulation of Bcl\u20102 as mechanisms to rescue oligodendrocytes from TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010mediated apoptosis (Soane et al., 1999). Thus, flupirtine may act at different levels of the apoptotic cascade and interfere with the balance of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signals.",

            "text": "The present study provides evidence that Bcl\u20102 is expressed constitutively by OLN cells and that the level of Bcl\u20102 expression depends on the stimulation with different concentrations of flupirtine and/or TNF\u2010\u03b1. Flupirtine increases the expression of Bcl\u20102 and protects neurons from \u03b2\u2010amyloid\u2010induced apoptosis or prion fragment\u2010mediated neurotoxicity (M\u00fcller et al., 1997; Perovic et al., 1997). In the present study, flupirtine alone or in addition to TNF\u2010\u03b1 up\u2010regulated Bcl\u20102 protein and rescued oligodendrocytes from TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced cell death. The induction of Bcl\u20102 expression may therefore be an interesting therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases to support oligodendrocyte survival. The question whether Bcl\u20102 plays a role in the survival of oligodendrocytes in MS lesions was recently studied (Kuhlmann et al., 1999). As already shown by others (Bonetti and Raine, 1997), Bcl\u20102 is present in MS plaques; our study, however, found a clear association among Bcl\u20102 expression, oligodendrocyte survival, and remyelination in MS plaques (Kuhlmann et al., 1999). Bcl\u20102\u2010associated mechanisms may belong to a group of different effectors that support survival of oligodendrocytes and include the activation of tyrosine kinase or cytokine receptors (Casaccia\u2010Bonnefil, 2000). New therapeutic strategies may develop from these experiments, preventing loss of oligodendrocytes from demyelinating lesions and supporting myelin regeneration.",
