Our model can make use and benefit from data gathered by a variety of contact tracing technologies and it can quantify the effects that different testing and tracing strategies, social distancing measures, and business restrictions may have on the course of the disease. Building on our model, we use Bayesian optimization to estimate the risk of exposure of each individual at the sites they visit, the percentage of symptomatic individuals, and the difference in transmission rate between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals from historical longitudinal testing data. Experiments using real COVID-19 data and mobility patterns from T\u00fcbingen, a town in the southwest of Germany, demonstrate that our model can be used to quantify the effects of tracing, testing, and containment strategies at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. To facilitate research and informed policy-making, particularly in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, we are releasing an open-source implementation of our framework. 1",

            "text": "To fulfill this promise, we need to utilize data-driven models and inference algorithms that can operate at a high spatiotemporal resolution and make use of contact tracing data of individuals. Unfortunately, most of the classical epidemiological literature [4, 13, 23, 37, 38] has primarily focused on developing models for general population dynamics rather than the infectious state of any given individual in the population. More recently, there has been research on modeling individual dynamics of epidemics [2, 7, 8, 43, 44] . However, this work typically resorts to mean-field theory and thus does not characterize the dynamic infectious state of each individual over time. The work closest in spirit to ours is by Ferguson et al. [14, 15] , who use a stochastic model of individuals situated at random locations in space to analyze strategies for preventing and containing influenza. However, they use ad-hoc assumptions about individual mobility patterns and cannot characterize the functioning of modern contact tracing systems. Finally, in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a flurry of work contemporary to ours [3, 11, 12, 16, 17, 27, 28, 31, 45, 47] , including research in which Ferguson et al. [16] re-use the above mentioned influenza models [14, 15] . However, none of these papers can characterize the fine-grained effects of testing, contact tracing, and containment interventions over time at a local level. The present work attempts to fill this gap.",

Our model is agnostic to the particular choice of conditional intensity function for mobility patterns. We further introduce a new intensity function that is able to characterize the influence that mobility patterns, as well as social distancing measures and business restrictions, have on the risk that each individual with the virus poses on their community. Moreover, we follow the recent literature on COVID-19 [17, 27] to define the specific functional form of the intensity functions that characterize the times when individuals become asymptomatic, presymptomatic, symptomatic, hospitalized, recovered, or deceased, and specify their parameter values accordingly. For testing, social distancing, and business restrictions, our model expresses a variety of real-world interventions. In addition, our model is also able to characterize the functioning of both location-based and proximity-based contact tracing systems under different contact tracing algorithms. Given a fixed set of individual mobility patterns, we design an efficient sampling algorithm for our model, summarized in Algorithm 1, that is able to predict the spread of COVID-19 under different testing & tracing strategies, social distancing measures, and business restrictions using Monte Carlo roll-outs. One of the key components of our sampling algorithm is the use of the superposition principle and thinning to generate faithful simulations. Ultimately, this allows us to accurately estimate the effect of a variety of interventions and what-if scenarios given a fixed set of location traces.

In our model, the effect of social distancing can be faithfully characterized at an individual level by modifying the individual mobility model introduced in Section 2.1. More specifically, if the authority decides to isolate a group W for example based on age for a period of time [t 0 , t 1 ], then it corresponds to setting the intensity \u03bb i,k (t) = 0 for all i \u2208 W and t \u2208 [t 0 , t 1 ] in Eq. 2.

Furthermore, our model can faithfully characterize the effect of business restrictions that the governmental authority may also decide to impose. For instance, if the authority asks supermarkets to implement hygienic measures to reduce the probability of customers infecting each other, it is straightforward to reduce the value of the corresponding transmission rates \u03b2 k in the conditional intensity function \u03bb * (t) of the counting process Y i (t), given by Eq. 4.

Bayesian optimization is a search method that models the objective function as being sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) prior, using function evaluations as observations to update the posterior of the objective given the evaluations [6] . At each iteration of the procedure, an acquisition function defined over the current GP posterior is cheaply optimized to determine the next point of function evaluation. L random realizations of our model for the proposed settings are generated in a distributed fashion, and the observed loss from Equation 9 or 10 is used to update the GP posterior by an additional observation.

We select the period from March 10, 2020 until March 25, 2020 under the assumption that, except for the isolation of positive cases, neither social distancing measures nor business closures took measurable effect on case counts yet after two days. Officially, restrictions on free movement and business closures within the country came into effect starting March 23, 2020 [24] . Following the inference procedure outlined in Section 4.2, we ran 100 simulations of twenty random realizations (L = 20) until observed convergence, proposing new parameters in BO after each batch of simulations. Every realization was also randomized across realizations of the synthetic mobility traces and infection seeds. We faithfully set the seed counts to approximately match the observed COVID-19 cases in T\u00fcbingen on March 10, 2020. Table 3 summarizes the inferred epidemic parameters. The estimate \u00b5 = 0.2072 indicates that the observed COVID-19 cases in T\u00fcbingen are likely to have followed an epidemic where asymptomatic individuals where significantly less infectious than symptomatic individuals. This approximately aligns with other recent estimates on the range of 0.1 to 0.55 [27, 17] . In addition, optimization revealed that the number of asymptomatic infections account for over a third of all infections. This is slightly below recent estimates in the range of 0.4 -0.5 [33, 16, 17] . Without further mentioning, all experiments in the remainder of this work are conducted using the optimized parameters listed in Table 3 . Worst-case projections for observed period of March 23 -April 12, 2020. The above conclusions were drawn as a result of inferring the parameters \u03b2, \u00b5, \u03b1 that likely underlie the current COVID-19 epidemic. When simulating 40 random realizations of the model using the inferred parameters, yet continue the simulation until April 12, i.e., the present day, the reproduction number R t is greater than one for most of the 20-day period and, as a consequence, the mean number of infections observed at the end of simulation is 1,465. With only averaging 76 infected individuals on March 23, this is an approximate increase by a factor of 20 in only a 20-day period. However, the variance in these estimates is significant with standard deviations of both values of 579 and 57 people, respectively. These deviations can be expected to be reduced by eliminating the source of randomness from the random mobility traces in simulations, for instance by using real data from contact tracing technologies.",

These include the closure , the effective reproduction number is estimated using the Bayesian approach in Bettencourt et al. [5, 40] , the line represents the most likely estimate and shading represents high density areas. In panels (c) and (d), lines represent means and error bars represent the standard deviation of total infections as given by the top line. In each panel, we run 40 independent realizations of the model. of schools, universities, and social sites, as well as several sanitary measures in public locations such as supermarkets. In addition, individuals were asked to follow a series of social distancing measures, e.g., that only groups of two people or when living in the same household were allowed to meet in public. As a result, the accelerating number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases slowed down until the present day, as shown in red in Figure 2a . The informally often so-called \"lockdown\" was at least effective in flattening the curve of infections. In our model, the above measures can be implemented in a straightforward manner. In particular, when (i) setting \u03b2 = 0 for any social place or educational institution, (ii) reducing the inferred parameter \u03b2 by 50% for all remaining sites, and (iii) reducing the check-in intensities \u03bb i,k (t) by an (unknown) percentage p \u00d7 100% for all individuals i in the population, the effects of the implemented state measures after March 23 can be estimated from Monte Carlo simulations. If we simulate the epidemic with the estimated parameters in Section 5.2 under the implemented restrictions (i)-(iii), one would intuitively expect that there is a value of p such that the number of simulated positive cases match the real positive cases also after March 23, 2020, until today. Figure 3 confirms this intuition, showing that the closest match occurs for p = 0.2, in agreement with the latest Google COVID-19 community mobility report for Baden-W\u00fcrtemberg [18] . Moreover, our results also revealed that, shortly after March 23, the reproduction number R t decrease to values below one. However, it is clear that maintaining business closures and social distancing measures for an extended period of time may have undesirable economic and social consequences. Using our model simulations, we will now attempt to answer several questions. How long should the current measures continue to be in place to halt the spread of COVID-19? Can less restrictive, time-varying measures that only apply to parts of the population succeed at halting the spread? Projections of current restrictions for various periods starting April 12, 2020. Figure 4 illustrates four scenarios, where the above-mentioned restrictions, which match the course of the epidemic in T\u00fcbingen until April 12, are extended for one, two, four, or eight weeks into the future. We observe that the measures in place up until April 12 were effective in slowing down the case counts to a point where the immediately subsequent weeks little new true infections occurred in the population. Noticeably, when extending the measures currently in place for only one or two weeks, a significant re-surge in infections starts to occur approximately one month after lifting the measures. In this scenario, infection counts would start growing again starting at the beginning of May, reaching peak infection counts in June 2020. Most importantly, we also note that when extending the current restrictions for at least one or two additional months, it is unlikely to observe another surge in infections at all across simulations. That being said, one should carefully consider the possibility that new imported cases from other locations, which are not accounted for by the specific instance of the model we used, would initiate a re-surge in infections. In the following sections, we will investigate to what extent two different social distancing strategies that only apply to parts of the population can achieve the same or similar effects as those that apply to everyone. Social distancing of the elderly population. Since people older than 60 years of age are expected to suffer more complications from COVID-19 [36] , it has been suggested that only the people who are most endangered should be isolated, allowing the rest of the population to slowly develop herd immunity [20] . Motivated by this suggestion, we only implement social distancing measures for people in the age groups older than 60 years, and lift all restrictions previously found to have matched the observed case development between March 23 and April 12, 2020, as for example used in the above experiments and Figures 3 and 4 More specifically, we enforce that the check-in activity at sites of the elderly population is reduced by 90% for a period of either one or two months. The results are depicted in Figure 5 and shown compared to a set of baseline simulation results without restrictions.",

In this simulated setting, peak number of hospitalizations were approximately halved and fatalities at least reduced by two-thirds across the entire population, showing the promise of the strategy (Figure 5(a) ). In addition, we find that the number of overall infections does not change significantly under these strategies ( Figure 5(b) ). This implies that herd immunity could be developed at a pace that is qualitatively comparable to an uncontrolled pandemic. In doing so, the peak and overall burden on the health care system are significantly lower, making social distancing for the elderly an effective mitigation strategy. Alternating curfews for random subgroups. Rather than implementing measures for specific demographic groups, we analyze an alternative approach of dividing the population into equal subgroups with the goal of reducing both intra-and inter-group exposure events, as suggested by recent work [22, 30] . Specifically, we consider a setting where the population is randomly split into K disjoint subsets. For instance, for K = 2, the population could be divided into groups of even and odd birth dates. Every day, the containment strategy prescribes curfews to K \u2212 1 of the random groups and only one is allowed to follow their usual daily activities. After K days, every group will have been allowed to follow a regular schedule exactly once. Our findings are summarized in Figure 6 . The scale is chosen to highlight a re-surge in observed daily infected individuals that is observed when the population is split in only two random groups. Conversely, we note that for the settings of three and four disjoint groups, the goals of significantly reducing both the intra-group contact exposures between individuals at sites as well as the inter-group exposures were achieved. We do not observe a re-surge in infection counts over a twelve week window of simulations in these settings.",

We start the simulation on April 12, 2020 and isolate both individuals who have tested positive, as done in all experiments of this work, and individuals who have been in contact with positively tested individuals and are identified using contact tracing. Here, we use the average population states observed at the end of the simulations summarized in Figure 3 as starting conditions and experiment with two different contact tracing policies as described in Section 3. Moreover, to avoid any obfuscation in estimating the true effect of social distancing via contact tracing, we do not implement any of the additional social distancing measures described in Section 5.3 and we lift all business restrictions. The above findings demonstrate the feasibility of individual tracing technologies for highly granular social distancing. In the following, we investigate to what extent these findings are robust to the individuals' compliance with the use of the prescribed contact tracing technologies. Effect of compliance on the effectiveness of contact tracing. We simulate various scenarios assuming that a given percentage of the population can neither be isolated using contact tracing nor their contacts be traced if tested positively because they elect not to comply with the implemented contact tracing system. These scenarios isolate the addition of contact tracing as a public health intervention, simulating the adoption of contact tracing at various rates of compliance with no other interventions active during the time of measurement. Figure 7b summarizes the results, which show that the effectiveness of social distancing via contact tracing gradually degrades as the compliance lowers due to the \"x 2 problem\" of adoption [17, 25] , i.e., two parties having to adopt contact tracing technology for the infection chain to be tracked. Below, we explore a potential strategy to circumvent the x 2 problem by means of using narrowcasting, i.e., making public service announcement which are highly tailored to a location or to a subset of individuals who may have been in a certain location during a specific period of time. Refer to Section 3 for model details. Narrowcasting by contact tracing. While some individuals may be reluctant to adopt or comply with contact tracing technology due to privacy violations concerning their personal data, they may still be willing to follow public service announcements. For example, an individual may be willing to self-isolate or seek testing if they are notified via narrowcasting that they recently visited a location with empirically high probability of exposure by other infected individuals. As discussed in Section 3, narrowcasting does not suffer from requiring pairs of compliant individuals in order to be effective for mitigation of COVID-19. Figure 8 presents an example of narrowcasting the empirical exposure probability of individuals at sites during a specific time window on an exposure map. Here, we have used contact data from one realization of the same baseline simulations as used in Figures 7a and 7b. As long as the level of compliance is uniformly distributed across the individuals who visit each site, the ranking of sites in terms of empirical probability of exposure will be invariant and not differ in expectation. In this case, the absolute value of empirical probability of exposure can be corrected for the level of compliance. In practice, it would be important to correct for compliance disparities across sites and site types, which are likely to occur due to differences in demographics and visiting patterns at certain sites.",

Once contact tracing contact technology becomes more popular, we believe our predictions will have lower variance and it will be possible to use our framework to identify areas with higher risk of infection in real time. In this context, we would like to highlight that, in the absence of Bluetooth beacons, proximity-based contact data will compare unfavorably with spatial-based contact data since it will only record contacts where two individuals have been near at the same point in time and, as a result, we will not capture environmental transmissions through aerosol or surfaces nor distinguish among different transmission rates across sites.",

The identity of the infected person is not required. As a result, there are reasons to believe that such computations can be made in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner [32, 41] .",

Colors represent site types as defined in Figure 1. individuals get selected for isolation and are subsequently kept in isolation for seven days. The window considered for contacts between individuals and the positively tested was three days and the contact tracing policies were implemented over the entire twelve weeks of simulation. The results reveal several interesting empirical findings: (i.) Both basic and advanced contact tracing show a significant reduction in total infected individuals compared to the baseline (i.e., no contact tracing). (ii.) Contact tracing is effective even when the number of isolated contacts are low. Refer to the left panel of Figure 7a, depicting the scenario when only 10 individuals with exposure contact are isolated.(iii.)
