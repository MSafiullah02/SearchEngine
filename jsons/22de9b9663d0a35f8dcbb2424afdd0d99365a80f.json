In this study, we carried out the first detection, sequencing and characterization of this virus in Mexico. We analysed 885 rectal samples by multiplex RT-PCR to determine coinfections. In addition, the Spike gene was amplified, sequenced and analysed phylogenetically. We found 85 positive samples for porcine deltacoronavirus, representing 9.6% of the total samples, and we determined that the most frequent coinfection was with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (54.1%). Four sequences of Mexican isolates were most closely related to those of the United States.",

This viral disease together with Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) have caused a significant economic impact due to the high mortality rate in piglets (Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2016; Zhang, 2016) . PDCoV belongs to the recently classified subgenus Buldecovirus of the Deltacoronavirus genus (ICTV, 2018) . The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae is divided into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. The first two genera originate in bats, while the third and fourth genera originate in birds (Woo et al., 2012) . These viruses can affect several species of mammals and birds and cause various clinical conditions (neurological, digestive and respiratory) (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014) .",

Coronaviruses received their name due to one of their surface proteins, which is spicule-shaped, giving the appearance of a crown. This so-called S or \"Spike\" protein is glycosylated and plays a fundamental role in the binding and entry of the virus into the cell (Masters, 2006) . The genome organization of PDCoV is in the following order: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), replicase (ORF 1ab), spike gene (S), envelope gene (E), membrane gene (M), nonstructural gene 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid gene (N), NS7 gene and 3\u00b4UTR.

In addition, it is interesting that a considerable number of samples (16/85) were positive for the three viral agents studied (PDCoV/PEDV/TGEV).",

Likewise, 17 glycosylations were located throughout the S1 region, similar those predicted by Xiaoli, X in 2018 to with the Illinois 2014 strain ( Figure 3a ). Knowing the glycosylation sites is important in the study of the antigenicity of the virus because the sites are part of a viral strategy to evade the host immune system (Shang et al., 2018) . We know that the immune response of B cells is against the spike protein (Mai et al., 2018) ; however, deeper studies would be necessary to evaluate whether these predictions coincide with the real antigenicity and pathogenicity of the protein.",
