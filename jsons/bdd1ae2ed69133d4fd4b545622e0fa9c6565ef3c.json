Ribavirin (1-( \u03b2 -d-ribofuranosyl-10-1,2,4-triazol-3-carboxamide)), which is commonly used for treating infections induced by RNA-containing viruses (including heavy forms of measles) [8] , was used as a reference drug.

Out of 14 compounds studied, compound 1a exhibited the greatest activity: its therapeutic index was much greater than that of ribavirin (245.5 and 14.4, respectively).

The antiviral activity slightly changed depending on the time of its addition to culture medium, when the compound was added simultaneously with the virus or within one day after infecting.
