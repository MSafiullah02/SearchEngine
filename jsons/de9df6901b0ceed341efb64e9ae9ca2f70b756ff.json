Third, the seasonal distribution of influenza in children appeared to be concordant with previous findings in adults, in which the majority of cases occurred between June and September [4] . However, our ability to assess flu seasonality was limited because the total number of influenza cases observed during our study period was surprisingly small and all were associated with viral types B and C. None of these cases was accompanied by a pneumococcal superinfection, which differs from other descriptions [4, 20] , but the absence of this infection may be due to our small numbers. This finding is important, as it emphasizes the value of long-term continuous surveillance to monitor trends in influenza and other respiratory viruses over time.

Even for RSV, the difference in viral prevalence between cases and controls was not statistically significant (P 5 .30), although the number of RSV detected was small. Seven viruses were found only in induced sputum, suggesting that induced sputum analysis could be of relevance for viral detection in some cases. Cultures of good-quality induced sputum yielded only 13 bacteria of 3 different species (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis); of note, all of these bacteria are also known to be involved in nasopharyngeal colonization in healthy children and in children with upper respiratory tract infection [22, 23] , as confirmed in our study by bacterial colonization among 31.8% of the controls. The fact that 4 of the bacteria isolated from induced sputum were also cultured from the matched NPS indicates that we cannot exclude the possibility of contamination by upper respiratory secretions. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine if a pathogen isolated from a good-quality induced sputum sample is more likely to be responsible for the respiratory infection if absent from the NPS collected simultaneously. In order to progress in the interpretation of findings from paired samples of induced sputum and NPS, a comparison with a gold standard method (eg, transthoracic needle aspiration) is needed.

In other settings with good primary care, high H. influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal vaccine coverage and high access to antibiotics, most pediatric respiratory illness of bacterial origin will be prevented or treated in the outpatient setting and never require hospitalization. In a trial of Hib vaccine in Lombok, Indonesia, which used active surveillance to identify sick children at home and treat them in village clinics early in the course of illness, the vaccine showed no protective effect against hospitalized LRI, suggesting that the early treatment of Hib cases prevented the progression to severe disease [24] . Similar results were observed for protection against hospitalized LRI by pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a trial among Native Americans (K. O'Brien, personal communication). Together, these results indicate that viruses cause the majority of severe, hospitalized cases of LRI in locations with good access to outpatient antibiotic treatment and support the etiological findings from our study. Related to this point, our study also likely differs from the PERCH study because the majority of enrolled patients had a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, rather than severe pneumonia. The PERCH study will enroll hospitalized cases of severe and very severe pneumonia as defined by WHO. Because this definition is nonspecific, it will likely capture some cases of bronchiolitis as well as pneumonia.
