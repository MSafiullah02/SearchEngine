That subject is the welfare of aged persons when catastrophic events pose a direct (or indirect) threat to nutrition and health (1, 2) . While there is a large body of literature on the health impact of natural and man-made disasters (e.g., droughts, floods, military conflicts) and associated long-term food shortages in the third world, surprisingly little information is available about the short and intermediate-term consequences of emergency situations in developed countries. In these situations, high population densities and heavy reliance on power-driven devices for day-to-day survival (e.g., electrical power for mass transit, elevators to reach living quarters, medical devices, and refrigeration of foods and medicines) can accelerate the speed with which a catastrophic, health-threatening situation develops. In 2005, the plight of the elderly evacuees from New Orleans (pre-storm population approaching 485,000) following Hurricane Katrina provided a dramatic demonstration of how essential services can rapidly deteriorate in a well-developed, highly populated urban environment following a major disaster and place older individuals in eminent mortal danger.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 473, "end": 476, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 477, "end": 479, "text": "2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS"}, {"text": "In order to lay the foundation for this discussion, we begin with some definitions (See Table 29 .1).

Some of the many factors that contribute to increased nutritional vulnerability of older adults are listed in Table 29 .3. In 2001, food insecurity and hunger affected at least 1.4 million households in the United States that contained older members (3) . People in 20% of those households also experienced hunger, in addition to food insecurity. Most of these older persons are suffering from food insecurity due to lack of income or due to their place of residence. Residents of the South are more apt to experience food insecurity, as are residents of cities and all elders who live alone (3). Recognizing the day-to-day nutritional vulnerability of its poor and elderly citizens, the U.S. government has a number of programs in place to provide assistance to elders at risk for food insecurity and hunger. Mandated by the Older American's Act, the Elderly Nutrition Program (ENP) provides a minimum of onethird of the daily calories required by recipients through daily meals and nutrition services to people aged 60 or older in group settings, such as senior centers and churches, or in the home, through home-delivered meals. The ENP provides an average of 1 million meals per day to older Americans. These meals are targeted toward highly vulnerable elderly populations, including the very old, people living alone, people below or near the poverty line, minority populations, and individuals with significant health conditions or physical or mental impairments. On an average the meals generously meet the RDA requirements, supplying more than 33% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for key nutrients, thus significantly increasing the dietary intakes of ENP participants. The meals are also ''nutrient dense'', that is, they provide high ratios of key nutrients per calories. The most recent evaluation of the ENP program occurred in 1996 and was conducted by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (www.mathematica-mpr.com/nutrition/ enp.asp). The resulting report clearly confirms that the ENP program recipients are at nutritional risk. It was found that between 80 and 90% of participants had incomes below 200% of the poverty level (twice the rate for the overall elderly population in the United States). More than twice as many Title III participants lived alone, compared with the overall elderly population. Approximately, twothirds of the participants were either overweight or underweight, placing them at increased risk for nutrition and health problems. Title III home-delivered participants had more than twice as many physical impairments, compared with the overall elderly population. Although (and perhaps because) the success of the ENP program is well recognized, 41% of Title III ENP service providers have waiting lists for home-delivered meals, suggesting a significant unmet need for these meals. It would appear that even in times of relative calm and prosperity for most Americans, there are elderly citizens who are persistently in a state of nutritional crisis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 414, "end": 417, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 282, "text": "Table 29", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Food Insecurity and Federal Food Assistance Programs"}, {"text": "When nutritionally and medically vulnerable older persons encounter a complex emergency, there is an increase in morbidity and mortality rates.

However, attention to the development of specialized Parish, Louisiana, due to a failure to comply with evacuation orders during Hurricane Katrina, and the bus accident in which 24 Houston, Texas, nursing home residents being evacuated from Hurricane Rita died in a fire that was sparked by mechanical problems and fed by the explosions of the passengers' oxygen tanks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emergency Preparedness in Structured Living Communities"}, {"text": "Beyond the obvious need for institutions and organizations like long-term care and hospice agencies to have detailed plans for evacuations and emergency conditions, there is also a need to identify ''at risk'' older adults living in the community. This would involve developing registries of ''vulnerable populations'' of elders based on degree of factors like contact need, predominant special impairment, and predominant life-support supply need, if any. By doing so, vulnerable elders could be easily identified in the event of a disaster and better supplied with assistance. Such registries are currently implemented in some instances (examples are available in California, www.aging.ca.gov, and Florida, www.broward.org/atrisk), but a more systematic approach has yet to be employed. These registries will most likely need to be local in origin and maintenance in order that control of sensitive health data would remain confidential. However, it would be preferable for the structure of the databases to be developed in a uniform format in order to facilitate the sharing of important data across local and regional entities.

This kit consisted of a small satchel, a flashlight, a photo album (to store copies of prescriptions, insurance cards, evacuation plans, contact phone numbers, and family pictures), a pill box and a pamphlet introducing the FEMA Web site. The trainees were then taught what other materials should be added to the kit to make it appropriate for a particular individual (Table 29 .6). Upon completion of this training each of the 150 trainees received two complete kits, one to use as an example during their subsequent training sessions of other health-care providers and the other to be given to a disadvantaged older person whom they deemed at risk during an emergency.

However, few respondents (15%) had provided any training to other health-care providers on how to create these kits. Barriers cited included lack of money to purchase kit contents, lack of commitment or permission from supervisors, lack of time to provide the training, and lack of time for their colleagues to receive training. The percentage of older adults that were reported to have used their emergency kits by the time of the end point survey was higher than expected (46%), especially given that only 18% of the (younger) trainees reported using their kits. However, a review of the disruptive weather patterns in the 11 counties in eastern Missouri and southwestern Illinois where the trainees (and therefore, presumably of the older adults receiving the extra kits) lived, indicated that three area-wide power outages had occurred between August 2006 and January 2007. All of these three power failures lasted 1-3 weeks, with the rural areas in southwestern Illinois being the last to get power restored each time. Each of these power failures affected at least a half million citizens each time. Numerous cooling or heating stations were set up for older adults, thereby allowing them to evacuate from their homes during the days in August and to receive warm meals during the November and January power failures. Multiple public service announcements encouraged people to evacuate their homes completely until power was restored, so many older adults either moved in with relatives who did have power or went to hotels. Under those conditions, it is reasonable to expect older persons to take their emergency kits with them. Many of the health-care provider trainees reported that they had gone to work daily. A brief second query to 10 trainees who had used their kits and 10 trainees who had not used their kits indicated that both sets had gone to work daily and returned home at night, even if they had no power at home.
