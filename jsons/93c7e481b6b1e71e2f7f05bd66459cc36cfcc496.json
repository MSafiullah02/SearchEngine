It was notable that blood flow from the trachea was observed during intubation. Repeated oral and tracheal suction was performed. Because the resuscitation took place in the general pediatric ward, health care workers participating in the resuscitation did not wear any protection, such as a facial mask and gloves. A necropsy was performed, and the findings revealed right lobar pneumonia with a necrotizing hemorrhage of the entire right lung and one-half of the left lung.

Previous studies have reported transmission of different pathogens during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation: Salmonella [5] , Herpes simplex [6] , Helicobacter pylori [7] , and more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [8] . In the present case, it is likely that transmission was related to the events leading up to intubation, and contact, droplet, or airborne transmission might have occurred. The transmission might have been promoted by the particular pathogenicity of PVL-producing strain. The transmission of the S. aureus strain to the physician was revealed by furunculosis. As previously reported, most cases of furunculosis (93%) are due to PVL-producing S. aureus [1] . Unfortunately, no nasal sample was obtained from this physician. This study highlights the necessity for health care workers to protect themselves against transmission of pathogens from patient to care giver, even in situations where benign infection is suspected.",
