This correlated with a dramatic reduction in the quantity and severity of demyelination seen 28 days p.i. However, mice that received adoptive transfers of gp33-specific CD8+ T cells on days 3 or 5 p.i. were not protected from acute disease, which was assessed by virus replication, viral antigen spread and encephalitis. Importantly, only the mice receiving the early transfer that were protected from acute disease had significantly reduced chronic demyelination as observed on day 28 p.i. (Table 1) . We observed that the early transfer, performed one day prior to infection, resulted in protection from acute and chronic disease. In addition, we observed that the transferred (CD45.2 positive) cells were activated and secreted IFN-\u03b3 in response to gp33 peptide and accumulated to high percentages within the brains by day 7 p.i. However, the transferred cells did not accumulate in the brain on day 7 p.i. when the transfers were performed on days 3 or 5 p.i. Thus, we examined the brain-derived mononuclear cells from transfer recipients at later time points, days 10 and 12 p.i. As is evident from the data shown in Table 2 when transfers were performed on days 3 or 5 p.i. significantly fewer transferred cells accumulated at the site of infection as compared to the transfer recipients that received the transfer prior to infection. Whereas nearly half of the CD8+ T cells were the transferred cells in the early transfer recipients on day 10 p.i., only about 10.0% and less than 1.0% of the CD8+ T cells were the transferred cells in the day 3 and day 5 transfer recipients, respectively. Furthermore, on day 12 p.i. the total numbers of both CD8+ T cells as well as the transferred CD45.2-positive cells decreased as compared to day 10 p.i. We concluded that the cells transferred on days 3 or 5 p.i. were defective in their activation and/or ability to traffic into the CNS. However, when transfers were performed in RAG-/-, we observed the accumulation of gp33-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells in the brain and the later the transfer was performed the higher the percentage of gp33-specific cells observed in the brain. RAG-/-do not contain endogenous T cells capable of lytic activity, thus, it is assumed that antigen presentation is prolonged. Thus, we predicted that when we transferred P14 splenocytes into B6 mice on days 3 or 5 the cells were not activated or recruited into the brain due to a lack of antigen presentation at that time point.

Intranasal infection results in a slower course of disease with most animals dying after the first week of infection allowed the analysis of recruitment of T cells into the brain. Mice were sacrificed at 7 days p.i. in order to analyze the epitope specific CD8+ T-cell response at the site of infection. Whereas 21.9% of the cells isolated from the brains of SJHM/RA59 infected animals were CD8+, only 0.8% of the cells isolated from the brains of RJHM infected animals were CD8+. Furthermore, the specific IFN-\u03b3 response to the two epitopes within the spike protein was much higher in the SJHM/RA59 infected animals (Fig. 2) .

When splenocytes were transferred on day 3 p.i., they were not activated to proliferate and, thus, did not accumulate within the brain. This provides more evidence that in order for CD8+ T cells to traffic to the site of infection they must undergo several rounds of division in the lymphoid organs. Furthermore, consistent with the idea that antigen presenting cells are destroyed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes as limiting determinant of immune activation we observed that transfers performed on days 3 and 5 p.i. in RA59-gfp/gp33 infected RAG-/did result in the accumulation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells within the brain 7 days post transfer ( Table 2) .
