Nonetheless, this dream is merely a toddling brainchild of education leaders and policymakers which wobbles around the cliffs of regional wars and conflicts, famines, natural disasters, pandemic diseases, and other threats. International education is growing in size, but not necessarily in strength; in the increasingly connected world, our interdependency puts us at a higher risk of disruption and unease. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about enormous hindrance to the internationalization of higher education (IHE) in our increasingly globalized, yet divided, world.",

However, this definition of IHE has been repeatedly broadened. In the early 1990s, definitions of IHE challenged previous interpretations for their instrumentalism, and emphasized internationalization as a set of integrated measures which incorporate the international dimension in an institution\u2019s primary functions, such as teaching, research, and social services (Knight 1993; Zha 2003). Later definitions highlighted that internationalization should be an intentional tool to serve global development goals and foster international partnership and cooperation rather than competition (Van Der Wende 2001). More recent reflections on IHE focus on post-hegemonic academic development, the use of English as the lingua franca, inclusiveness, and tensions between commercial competition under marketization versus intellectual collaboration for quality improvement (Knight 2012; DeWit 2019). In the context of modern nationalism of North America and countries in continental Europe, many are concerned about neoliberal commodification (Marinoni and DeWit 2019), and some scholars identify new critical players in IHE such as China (Altbach and DeWit 2017).",

China\u2019s IHE is rapidly changing in its fast-growing economy and in a unique socio-political context (Zheng and Kapoor 2020). Under China\u2019s adaptive governance approach in policymaking (Heilmann and Perry 2011), the nation continually adjusts its governance strategy (Lim 2017) as a means to experiment with innovative policies to build state and university consensus (Han 2020). Grown from a long tradition of totalitarian instrumentalism, China\u2019s state government remains an essential authority in educational systems. At the same time, it relinquishes from direct supervision of IHE, providing universities and the private sector with high levels of autonomy within set boundaries (Han and Xu 2019; Yang et al. 2007; Zha 2012). These various stakeholders are still far from striking a balance, yet due to its size and influence, China\u2019s IHE is a global player worthy of attention. According to the Ministry of Education of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2019a, b), in 2018 China had over 492,000 international students from 196 countries studying in 31 provinces, and over 662,100 Chinese students abroad\u2014almost all of which have not received government or institutional funding (Ministry of Education of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2019a, b).",

Ironically, for many, this visit, which usually lasts no more than one to 2 weeks, has now been prolonged indefinitely. As millions of families anxiously wait, confined to their homes, praying for news of a cure, or for that matter, any signs of abatement, the virus continues to spread across the globe.

However, on around January 21st, news started circulating about just how dangerous this virus was, with daily updates on the incredibly infectious nature of Covid-19 quickly turning a regional concern into a full-scale national emergency not witnessed since the SARS outbreak of 2004. Around this time, the government began to lock down not just Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, but every city, prohibiting inter-province travel and confining netizens to their homes, with bands of local volunteers, reminiscent of the red guard militias of the past, ensuring that stringent new curfews are adhered to by all. It was almost surreal as images of Americans being evacuated from Wuhan swept across social media on January 29th. Many foreign nationals followed suit, catching last-minute flights out of the country, sometimes having to transfer multiple times to avoid travel bans enacted for passengers flying out of China. Some stayed, however, choosing, for one reason or another, to wait it out, placing outsized trust in our adopted homeland, hoping against hope that China\u2019s exceptional measures of containment could stem the rising tide of infection. For those of us not hailing from centralized nation-states, we cannot help but marvel at how efficiently China has managed the quarantine of its almost 1.4 billion citizens, hoping that our own countries can find their paths towards containing the spread to our families and loved ones overseas. So, we continued to wait, sometimes patiently, sometimes in desperation, frequently with a malaise that comes only hard-earned, from having not left your apartment for weeks on end, from the feeling of never knowing when this interminably cruel holiday might end.",

The one caveat, all classes would now be held online. I wondered aloud, and not so politely, at how this would be possible. How could an entire nation take classes online? This was a government decision which touched every single level of education. From compulsory education at grade one, all the way up to Ph.D. level graduate courses, everything would now be held in one form of virtual classroom or another. My skepticism would need to be held in check, as of now, during the time of this writing, China\u2019s millions of students are studying online, to varying degrees of success no doubt, but studying online nonetheless. And I, an avowedly anti-online education professional, someone who more than once decried the need for a physical classroom as a medium for scholarly debate and socialization, find myself not just taking an online course, but teaching two as well. So I am now confronted with the task of undoing all of my prejudices and biases against the digital pedagogical revolution, hoping, praying that I can evolve quickly enough, and with enough acumen, to provide my students with an educational experience that overcomes the obstacles present within an education system grappling against a semi-apocalyptic viral pandemic.",

I shared the story with him at once, and he said: \u2018it is bad\u2019. Later on, as the news reached more people around the world, different interpretations and voices came up.

Covid-19 was labeled a dangerous disease without a cure; at the time, scientists were not even sure about its mode of transmission.

Others who came before me studied successfully and returned home with no stigma, but I was caught in the middle of the outbreak.

While initial experiences with Covid-19 took place in China, people around the world have been now impacted as the pandemic has reached global proportions. Based in Hong Kong and originally from the USA, I have often compared my experiences of being impacted by Covid-19 with those of family and colleagues in western countries. While many people face the same basic predicaments no matter where they are, at the same time differing conditions and personal particularities, of identity and perspective, make a difference. This article thus effectively highlights both unique experiences and shared ones with Covid-19 in China, at the same time revealing fascinating paradoxes of the struggle to cope with Covid-19 in the context of international higher education.",

Some express pride, about fast thinking in China, in relation to the pandemic and moving education en masse online. Others reveal early disdain for online education, followed by surprise at its possibility, for learning and connecting with others. Yet others share about having prior confidence with online learning, but shifting into uncertainty, in novel conditions.

Yet at the same time, there is space for new pride in Chinese identity as well, as the response to Covid-19 there has been swift and effective, although this also raises questions about the value of personal liberty, from an international view. Being in Hong Kong, I resonated with such reflections, as Hong Kong faces a similar challenge, as it is accused by western people of coping with Covid-19 in an \u2018obedient\u2019 way, which is increasingly being recognized as an \u2018effective\u2019 way.",
