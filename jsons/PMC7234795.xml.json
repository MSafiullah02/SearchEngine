Lesions in dsDNA are prevented from becoming mutations by templated excision repair [1]. However, lesions in ssDNA are not reparable through any excision repair pathway because of the lack of the requisite template strand. While certain kinds of base alkylation in ssDNA can be repaired via direct reversal repair (DRR) [2,3], this repair mechanism cannot reverse all ssDNA lesions, which would result in mutations once copied by error-prone trans-lesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases. Yeast studies have shown that the density of mutations stemming from lesions in ssDNA can exceed 100-1,000-fold over the rest of the genome [[4], [5], [6]] (also reviewed in [5,7] and summarized on Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n).",

In both cases, subsequent replication often involving error-prone TLS would fix these lesions as mutations. Hypermutation in a ssDNA stretch can often result in the generation of a tightly spaced group of mutations called a mutation cluster. Mutation density in clusters is far greater than the density of mutations seen in the rest of the genome, where lesions either do not occur or are repaired by excision repair pathways before copying the damaged strand. If a cluster is formed by a single source of DNA damage, lesions as well as the resulting mutations would be similar in the progeny of the damaged strand, and are commonly referred to as strand-coordinated clusters [6]. Notably, strand-coordinated clustering only implies the simultaneous occurrences of similar mutations. In case of acute mutagenesis, the density of lesions in dsDNA across the genome can be very high. If high-density lesions are not repaired in small section(s) of a genome, they will again result in a mutation cluster. Subsequent DNA replication will separate clustered mutations of the top (Watson) strand and bottom (Crick) strand into different cells, so a cluster found in a single-cell clone will be strand-coordinated (Fig. 3\n).",

In a series of studies by Rosenberg and colleagues, it was established that this phenomenon is initiated by DSB repair and possibly involves ssDNA formed as a result of break-induced conjugational transfer of bacterial F\u2019-episome or chromosome as well as with repair of an episome-independent DSB [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. Adaptive mutagenesis relies on error-prone DNA synthesis that is activated by stress caused by DNA break(s) and is often referred to as stress-induced mutagenesis (reviewed in [20]). Stress-induced mutagenesis in E. coli relies upon a large gene-network and may be responsible for up to 50 % of spontaneous mutagenesis in starving E. coli [21] as well as for mutagenesis in strains treated with clastogens [22].",

            "text": "Various studies on yeast model systems have also demonstrated mutagenesis in long and persistent ssDNA which requires restoration to dsDNA for viability. One way to generate long and persistent ssDNA is to use yeast strains with a temperature sensitive allele of the CDC13 gene. Upon the shift of the cdc13-1 mutant to high non-permissive temperature yeast telomeres are uncapped and 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 resection ensues from the telomere ends. Cells with multi-kilobase resection at multiple telomeres get arrested in G2 until the switch to the permissive temperature where re-synthesis of the second strand is allowed (Fig. 1). A 100-fold increase in mutation frequencies in a reporter placed in this ssDNA region was seen compared with the same reporter in the area of continuously double-stranded DNA [4,31]. DSB-associated spontaneous hypermutation in ssDNA was also observed when only one end of a DSB participated in recombinational repair. In this case, invasion of a free DNA end into a homologous template triggers DNA synthesis via break-induced replication (BIR), which can go as far as the chromosome end [32]. Strand invasion creates a displacement loop which proceeds along the chromosome by DNA polymerase extending the 3\u2032-end of the invading strand. Importantly, second strand synthesis can be triggered much later. This results in persistent long ssDNA regions upstream of the migrating bubble [33,34]. This DSB-associated synthesis was also found to be error-prone with increased rates of base substitutions and small insertions and deletions (indels) (Fig. 1C) [35,36]. BIR initiated by a single-strand nick also causes spontaneous hypermutation around the nick site. Long stretches of nick-associated hypermutation has been shown to be prevented by the activity of Mus81, a Holliday junction resolution protein [37].",

Insertion of an adenine residue opposite this uracil by DNA polymerases, followed by a second round of replication will fix the change as a C\u2192T mutation. Indeed, subtelomeric clusters of strand-coordinated C\u2192T mutations were found in the yeast strain that were prone to the loss of telomere caps and expressing the APOBEC3G cytosine deaminase [31]. In this strain, the gene coding for the Ung1 DNA glycosylase was deleted preventing the creation of an abasic site (AP-site) from excision of uracil in DNA. Copying of uracils resulting in C\u2192T mutations did not require functional TLS. When the same strain was treated with bisulfite, leading to chemically induced cytosine deamination, most of the mutations were also C\u2192T, however up to 90 % of mutagenesis required TLS. Yeast studies on ssDNA mutagenesis by the APOBEC cytidine deaminases revealed that uracils generated in ssDNA are efficiently converted into abasic sites by Ung1 before they are copied by the replicative DNA polymerases. This conclusion was made based on the complete dependence of APOBEC-induced hypermutation in ssDNA of UNG1 strains on functional TLS, unlike the \u0394ung1 isolates. In these strains, all base substitutions in cytosines (major substitutions \u2013 C\u2192T and C\u2192G and the minor substitution \u2013 C\u2192A) were dependent on the activity of TLS (See example in Fig. 1). C\u2192G substitutions completely relied on the catalytic activity of Rev1, a dCTP terminal transferase [31,39,43,44].",

Mutations in guanines made up a very small fraction of the mutations identified in yeast. This observation corroborated previous findings that N7-methylguanines are mostly benign lesions and are copied accurately by DNA polymerases.

While 8-oxo guanine is considered to be the major mutagenic product in DNA caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), the major component of the mutation spectrum in yeast subtelomeric ssDNA was C\u2192T mutations. The potential impact of cytosine deamination on the mutation spectrum was excluded, because these mutations did not depend on the activity of the uracil DNA glycosylase Ung1. Surprisingly, oxidative damage-induced C\u2192T mutations were also TLS independent. The authors proposed that a currently unknown modification of cytosine in ssDNA by ROS was the source of the mutations observed [50,51]. Interestingly, a similar mutation spectrum was found in human mitochondrial DNA in the regions that are expected to be single stranded in the displacement loop formed during mitochondrial DNA replication [[51], [52], [53]].

MMS was highly mutagenic to the lagging strand template of a mutation reporter in budding yeast strains wherein the replication fork integrity was compromised by deletions of either TOF1 or CSM3 (homologs of the human Timeless and Tipin genes) [6]. The lagging strand template was also preferably mutagenized by the ssDNA-specific cytidine deaminases \u2013 APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B even in replication-proficient yeast strains [54].

Downregulation of lagging strand polymerases Pol\u03b4 or Pol\u03b1 in yeast strains expressing APOBEC3B resulted in hypermutation strongly biased to the lagging strand template, with much smaller effect and no strand-specificity when the leading strand polymerase Pol\u03b5 was downregulated [56]",

Mutation clusters can often arise in such regions where the ssDNA accumulated DNA damage. In the case of mutagens which have a defined mutation spectrum in ssDNA, these mutation clusters may be strand coordinated. If the hypermutable ssDNA was a product of bidirectional 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 resection, mutation clusters would form on both sides of the break, and the bias in base substitutions would reflect mutagenesis in the top (Watson) strand to the left of the break followed by a switch to mutagenesis in the bottom (Crick) ssDNA strand to the right of the break (Fig. 1B). In the case of asymmetrical resection, a cluster would span only one side of the site-specific DSB with mutation strand bias reflecting 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 resection. Formation of large strand-biased mutation clusters in the vicinity of a site-specific DSB repaired by homologous recombination (HR) was first detected in a reporter gene placed in the DSB vicinity on either the left or right side of the DSB. Mutation specificity in each case agreed with long 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 resection [4,39]. Whole genome sequencing of yeast strains exposed to chronic alkylation damage (MMS) or yeast strains repairing multiple simultaneous radiation-induced DSBs in the presence of the APOBEC3A cytosine deaminase allowed the detection of single-switch clusters presumably near DSBs [6,57]. In both studies, single-switch clusters displayed mutation bias agreeing with bidirectional resection from a DSB.",

Importantly, ssDNA region on both sides of the position of the break would be in the same strand. ssDNA-specific damage during BIR would result in the formation of a strand-coordinated mutation cluster with the same base substitutions seen on both sides of the break (Fig. 1C). Based on the length and location of strand-coordinated clusters of mutations induced by either alkylation agent (MMS) or by ssDNA-specific cytosine deaminase APOBEC3A in yeast strains undergoing BIR, it was ascertained that hypermutable ssDNA stretches in yeast can exceed 100 kb [38,44].",

            "text": "Soon after discovery of the APOBEC3-induced mutation signature in clustered hypermutation within cancer genomes [6,74] the activity of the APOBEC3B enzyme was postulated to be the major source of this hypermutation in cancers [75,76]. This assumption was made based on the high expression level of APOBEC3B mRNA in solid tumors carrying APOBEC hypermutated genomes and supported by positive, albeit weak, correlation between mRNA levels and mutation load. Detailed statistical analysis in yeast subtelomeric ssDNA revealed the specific motifs preferred by either APOBEC3A or by APOBEC3B. APOBEC3A preferred pyrimidine (ytCa motif), while APOBEC3B preferred purine (rtCa) in the -2 position. This allowed a distinction between the APOBEC3A-like and APOBEC3B-like hypermutation in cancers [60] and to classify mutation catalogues of whole-genome sequenced human tumors as APOBEC3A-like or APOBEC3B-like. Analysis of hundreds of cancer samples revealed that APOBEC3A-like tumors contained about 10-fold more APOBEC-signature mutations as compared to the APOBEC3B-like tumors [60]. On the other hand, the APOBEC3B-like signature was clearly present in tumors with lower levels of APOBEC mutagenesis [60,77]. Interestingly, APOBEC3B-like signature was present in mutation clusters of prostate tumors even if genome-wide APOBEC mutagenesis was barely detectable. The levels of clustered APOBEC3B-like mutagenesis was found to increase with the age of diagnosis, thus leading to the identification of APOBEC3B-induced mutagenesis as a \u201cclock-like\u201d mutation process in human cancers [78]. A recent study demonstrated that in the presence of cellular RNA, the APOBEC3A enzyme has about a 100-fold greater activity than APOBEC3B, which may in part explain higher level of APOBEC3A-like mutagenesis in tumors with abundant APOBEC3B mRNA [79].",

            "text": "APOBEC3A-like tumors from the PCAWG dataset [80] revealed a large number of scattered APOBEC-signature mutations as well as many mutation clusters with only C- or(and) G-mutations highly enriched with the APOBEC3A-like mutation signature [57]. Only a small fraction of these clusters was categorized as single-switch (only C- mutations, followed by only G-mutations) and in half of these clusters the order of C- and G-stretches did not conform with canonical bi-directional 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 resection. Completely C- or G-coordinated clusters represented the largest category. By comparing distribution of cluster types in APOBEC3A mutated cancers with clusters occurring in yeast repairing radiation-induced DSBs in the presence of heterologous expression of APOBEC3A, Gordenin and co-authors proposed that the major mechanism generating large stretches of hypermutable ssDNA in human tumors is BIR (Fig. 1C) or another unusual form of DNA replication resulting in long range uncoupling of synthesis between two DNA strands [57]. They also estimated the total length of hypermutable ssDNA formed in a single yeast cell repairing a burst of DSBs by summing up the lengths of clusters in a genome as approximately a 100 kb. Surprisingly, cluster size-based estimate of hypermutable ssDNA in tumor genomes demonstrated the same (\u223c100 kb) ssDNA lengths as yeast, despite the fact that the human genome is \u223c300-fold larger than the yeast genome. They proposed that hypermutable ssDNA in tumors is formed as rare bursts of events, rather than in small amounts spread across many cell generations. Additionally, the upper limits on the total length of ssDNA tolerable by a cell is set by the probability of forming an unrepairable DSB. It has been suggested that a single unrepaired DSB would be lethal regardless of the genome size [81]. As such, if a single catastrophic event in a tumor genome yields a large amount of ssDNA in the form of DNA repair intermediates, the proportion of the ssDNA formed would directly correlate with the probability of creation of an unrepairable DSB.",

SN2-type alkylating agents were found to preferentially mutagenize cytosines and adenines in ssDNA. Mutations in adenines led to an equal amount of A\u2192T and A\u2192G changes, likely due to the formation and mutagenic bypass of N1-methyladenines in ssDNA. Such A\u2192T and A\u2192G changes were also found to be biased towards the non-transcribed strand in lung and head and neck tumors. The authors hypothesized that these changes were likely induced by the activities of SN2-type alkylating agents present in tobacco smoke. The authors also identified a separate mutation signature in thymines (nTg \u2192nGg and hTg\u2192hGg, h is a, c or t) that was highly specific for SN2-type alkylation-induced DNA damage. This signature along with the strand-biased A\u2192T and A\u2192G changes was indeed found to be enriched in the genomes from smokers, indicating that tobacco smoke-specific alkylating agents induce A\u2192T and A\u2013G changes in ssDNA in lung and head and neck tumors [47].",

This tendency is usually explained by lower access of DNA repair enzymes to late replicating regions enriched with heterochromatin. Surprisingly, Sunyaev and colleagues noticed that in several whole-genome sequenced human cancers clustered as well as scattered APOBEC mutagenesis was stronger in early replicating regions [91]. A similar tendency for clustered APOBEC mutagenesis was reported in a recent pan-cancer study [80], while, another study reported a flat profile of APOBEC3-induced mutagenesis across late and early replicating regions of breast cancer genomes [86]. One possible explanation for the preference of APOBEC mutagenesis in early replicating regions could be a higher propensity of ssDNA formation in these genomic areas due to higher frequency of breakage as indicated by increase in rearrangements seen in early replicating sections [92,93]. This suggestion is supported by the frequent colocalization of APOBEC mutation clusters with breakpoints of gross chromosomal rearrangements as was noticed in the initial studies [6,73,74] and later confirmed by analyses of large cohorts [78,93,94]. On the other hand, breast cancer genomes are predisposed to DSBs and the high incidence of DSBs may cause the formation of large amounts of ssDNA even in late replicating regions, causing a flatter mutation landscape of APOBEC3-induced mutations across the genome.",

Increased frequency of de novo mutations in the vicinity of meiotic breaks was also demonstrated by pulldown and accurate single-molecule sequencing of DNA next to sites of meiotic DSBs in human males [97].",

Accounting for parent of origin led to the identification of the source of the majority of germline mutations as an age-dependent mutational process occurring in oocytes [99]. One study reported clustering next to germline rearrangement breakpoints [102]. C\u2192T (or G\u2192C) mutations were prevalent in clusters across the different studies. It is worth noting that hypermutation in ssDNA or DNA damage in dsDNA followed by replication prior to resolution of the damage can lead to clustered mutations along with strand coordination (Fig. 3). As such, lesions accumulated in oocytes and then fixed as mutation in the first cell division of a zygote would manifest as strand-coordinated clustered mutations seen in the human germline. More studies are needed to assess the sources and mechanisms of clustered hypermutation during meiotic recombination.",

Mutant protein molecules resulting from such mutagenesis in transcripts may even have pathological consequences [103]. In addition to RNA lesions there are two types of RNA editing enzymes, ADAR adenine deaminases (changing adenines to inosines) and AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases. The latter can work on DNA as well as on RNA. RNA editing of a small number of specific sites is a well-known phenomenon with physiological function, however widespread editing of random sites in mRNAs is occurring at a low frequency in each transcript (reviewed in [104,105]. RNA editing by ADARs [106,107] and APOBECs [108] was suggested to play a role in viral evolution and restriction in cells. Recently, it was also found that RNA viruses may be hypermutated as well [109]. A heavily mutated propagated Rubella virus was isolated from cutaneous granulomas of children with primary immunodeficiency. The virus isolated was a mutated isoform of the propagation-incapable rubella vaccine administered to all children after birth. Hundreds of mutations in the 10 kb viral genome mostly conformed to tCn APOBEC signature and were strongly biased to the viral plus strand. ADAR signature was also detectable but was less strand biased and represented a minor fraction of the mutations. Since replication cycle of Rubella virus is the same as in many other + strand ssRNA viruses, including Coronaviridae, hypermutation by APOBECs may be detected in other viral RNA genomes. Interestingly, the presence of APOBEC mutation signature was recently reported in Coronavirus from two COVID-19 patients [110]. This finding leads to more questions regarding the abundance of RNA hypermutation in model systems and human cells, and if in addition to viral RNA, mRNA may also be hypermutated.",

In E. coli, stress-associated mutagenesis, presumably associated with ssDNA formed during DSB-repair, was estimated to be responsible for up to 50 % of the spontaneous mutagenesis detected upon starvation of the cultures [21]. We speculate that the phenomenon of the constant rate of spontaneous mutation per genome in DNA-based microbes with either small or large genomes [[119], [120], [121]] can be also explained by major contribution of ssDNA hypermutation in spontaneous mutagenesis. Based on the study by Sakofsky et al. it was suggested that the tolerated amount of hypermutable ssDNA in genomes of yeast and cancer cells is comparable irrespective of the genome size [57]. Generalizing this observation, we speculate that the amount of ssDNA that can be tolerated by a cell could dictate cell survival. Thus, in biological contexts where hypermutable ssDNA would be the major source of spontaneous mutations, mutation rate would be proportional to the absolute size of hypermutable ssDNA which would be limited to a similar extent in small and in large genomes",

The figures are adapted from [7]. A. 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 DNA resection at uncapped telomeres. (i) In the temperature sensitive cdc13-1 yeast strains, yeast telomeres are uncapped upon shift of the strains to 37 \u00b0C. 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 resection ensues and approximately 30 kb of the telomeric ends are rendered single stranded. The undamaged nucleotides are depicted as red (cytosines) or blue (guanine) circles with white background with the nucleotide shown as a black letter inside a circle. (ii) Exposure to a ssDNA-specific mutagen will lead to DNA damage in the un-resected single strand (yellow stars). In this figure, we depict DNA damage in cytosines in ssDNA as an example. (iii) Upon switch to permissive temperatures the resected strand is resynthesized. In the absence of excision of the damaged base by a glycosylase, DNA replication over the lesions will yield mutations. Mutated nucleotides are shown as filled circles. Red solid circles correspond to mutant nucleotides originated from damaged cytosines and blue solid circles to nucleotides that replaced damaged guanines. (The same color code and symbols are used in throughout all panels of Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). As an example, replication of unrepaired base damage in cytosines such as deamination will be expected to yield strand coordinated clusters (stretches of C\u2192T changes). (iv) On the other hand, certain DNA glycosylases have been shown to function in ssDNA. As such, the removal of the damaged base (depicted as red circles with a yellow star) in ssDNA may lead to abasic sites in ssDNA (dotted red circles). (v, vi) Bypass of such abasic sites by translesion polymerases during resynthesis of the resected strand will lead to insertions of A or C opposite the abasic sites. In the example shown in the figure, bypass of abasic sites generated upon excision of damaged cytosines in ssDNA will yield C\u2192T and C\u2192G changes. B. Bidirectional resection at double strand breaks. (i) A two ended break is symmetrically resected on both sides of the break to generate 3\u2032 overhangs. ssDNA-specific base damage in the overhangs and (ii, iii) bypass of the damaged base leads to single-switch clustered mutations. An example of ssDNA-specific damage leading to mutations in cytosines is shown here. DNA damage accumulated in the single stranded overhangs created during repair lead to clustered mutations in cytosines to the left of the break-point followed by clustered mutations in guanines to the right of the break-point. C. Break-induced replication. (i) A one-sided DNA double strand break is repaired via 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 resection of the broken end and (ii) a one-ended invasion into a homologous donor template. Uncoupling of the leading and lagging strands during break-induced replication yields long ssDNA intermediates that accumulate DNA damage. (iii) Synthesis of the second strand using the damaged template strand followed by excision repair of the lesions fixes the mutations in the newly synthesized DNA molecule. As an example, damage and mutations in cytosines is depicted here. Note that unlike for bi-directional resection, cytosines of the top strand are mutated on both sides of a DSB.",

(i) In the presence of an ssDNA-specific DNA damaging agent, ssDNA gaps in the lagging strand accumulate DNA damage. As an example, DNA damage accumulated in cytosines is portrayed here. (ii, iii) Bypass of the lesions without excision repair fixes the mutations in the daughter DNA and leads to the formation of replication-strand biased mutation clusters.
