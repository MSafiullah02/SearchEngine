More than 2/3rd of individuals were drinking un-boiled water. Hence lack of sanitation and unsafe water seems to be responsible for endemicity of hepatitis A and E infection. As the sentinel sites were public hospitals in large cities, catchment population consist of urban poor, hence distant cases, other socioeconomic class and individuals with high risk behaviors catered by NGOs were missed. To improve generalizability and robust data there is need to increase number of sentinel sites and includging private, NGO driven facilities as well. ",
