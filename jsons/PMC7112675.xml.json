G. duodenalis, G. lamblia) are protozoal intestinal parasites which cause mild to severe diarrhoea in humans and infect a wide range of animals including, livestock, pets and wild animals [1,2]. The resilient environmental stages of the parasites (oocysts and cysts, respectively) are transmitted by faecal-oral route via contaminated food or water [3,4]. Mammalian infections with G. intestinalis are caused by different genotype assemblages (A to H) [5]. Humans can become infected by a wide range of Cryptosporidium and Giardia species and genotypes, and cattle are considered to be a major contributor to zoonotic transmission [6,7].",

Cattle are primarily infected with G. intestinalis assemblage E [[9], [10], [11]] but assemblages A and B can also be detected [9,12,13]. The latter cause the majority of human infections worldwide [5,14,15] but assemblage E can also occasionally be found in humans [[16], [17], [18]]. G. intestinalis can be found both in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic calves so its role as a pathogen in cattle is unclear [13,19].",

On the farm two commercial immunochromatographic point-of-care tests for the detection of G. intestinalis (FASTest\u00ae Giardia Strip, Megacor, Austria) and C. parvum (FASTest\u00ae Crypto Strip, Megacor, Austria) were carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions by the local veterinarian or one of the authors (KL).

Faecal samples were transferred to the University Clinic for Ruminants Vienna and processed immediately. The SAF (sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin solution) method was used for purifying faecal samples [38]. Briefly, 1 g of homogenized sample material was diluted with 10 ml SAF solution, filtered, centrifuged (2 min, 500 x g) and the supernatant was discarded. After mixing of 8 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution and 3 ml diethyl ether, the sample was centrifuged again.

Since Austrian farms are run as small-scale enterprises (with an average of 33 heads per farm in 2018; www.statistik-austria.at) the number of sampled calves per farm (2.5 on average) was limited. In addition, the protocol was restricted to single convenience samples from a wide age range of animals. Consequently, the occurrence of these protozoa on the farm level is most likely underestimated. A representative sample including diseased and healthy animals will be necessary to describe the true prevalence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium on Austrian farms and to draw conclusions on their epidemiology and their role as enteropathogens in Austrian calves.",

However, the specificity of the FASTest\u00ae was high (98.4%), which is in accordance with a previous investigation which determined a low sensitivity (28% and 26%) but a high specificity (92% and 93%) of two point-of-care tests in comparison with the IFA for the detection of Giardia in presumably infected calves [51]. Geurden and coworkers [51] put down the lower sensitivity to the smaller amounts of faeces used in the point-of-care tests since the IFA method utilises a concentration of faeces. More than three-quarters (77.1%) of the calves showed low or moderate cyst excretion. It is hypothesized that the amount of cysts was beyond the detection limit of the FAStest\u00ae Giardia since it was developed for calves shedding higher numbers of cysts. Comparing PCM with the FASTest\u00ae Crypto, 84.7% of the PCM positive samples revealed positive results in the point-of-care test.

In Southern Germany 101/110 Giardia intestinalis-positive faecal samples from calves were positive for genotype assemblage E, eight for A and one had a mixed infection with A and E [13]. Similar assemblage distributions are described for the UK and the USA, where the predominant genotype was assemblage E (which is suggested to be host-specific), followed by assemblage A which is considered as zoonotic [10,53]. Recent investigations showed that G. intestinalis genotype assemblage E is frequently found in diarrhoeic but also in non-diarrhoeic calves [11,13,54]. Assemblage co-infections are reported worldwide [10,14], but were not detected in this study. The single sample positive for genotype A was 100% identical with sequences published in GenBank\u00ae isolated from cervids (fallow deer, moose, red deer). The assumed host-specific sub-assemblage AIII is primarily detected in wild ungulates [20,55,56], but occasional appearances of sub-assemblage AIII in cattle [57] have been reported. The 75 days-old calf harbouring this genotype was housed indoors with another calf of the same age. The farmer used bedding material from fields located in a forest, and it can be speculated that wild deer droppings containing cysts of G. intestinalis assemblage A were introduced to the calves\u2019 housing. Infection was confirmed by IFA visualization of parasite stages, so mere DNA detection without infection, possibly confounding results of genotyping [5], can be ruled out in this case. In samples from human patients Giardia genotype assemblage B was found in 65% of the positive samples, while the rest belonged to assemblage A (25% AII, 10% AI) [15]. The diversity of Giardia genotypes between humans and calves in Austria indicates that zoonotic transmission is limited.",

Subtype family IId, common in Italian calves [31], was not detected in the present study. Specifically, 82.9% of the sequenced samples revealed C. parvum subtype IIaA15G2R1, the most prevalent subtype in calves worldwide [32,58]. Calves with symptoms of diarrhoea excrete C. parvum genotype IIaA15G2R1 more frequently than asymptomatic animals [25]. This subtype is also considered the most common in humans, indicating its high zoonotic potential and the risk of human infections originating from infected calves [7,27]. Subtypes IIaA19G2R1, IIaA21G2R1 and IIaA14G1R1, detected in samples from five different farms, also occur occasionally in humans and cattle [28,59,60].",
