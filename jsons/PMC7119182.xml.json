Many are aware that a Penicillium spore landed by chance on an agar plate seeded with Staphylococcus aureus by Alexander Fleming and that this led to his discovery of penicillin and the dawn of the antibiotic era. Many like to emphasize the serendipity of this finding, but Fleming had been working for years searching for anything that would inhibit S aureus like that, illustrating Pasteur's statement that \u201cchance favors the prepared mind.\u201d",

It does not necessarily negate all the data previously collected but may change the interpretation of the whole pattern. For example, Howard Margolis,1 a professor of the history of science at the University of Chicago, believes that the explorations of Columbus and others resulting in the publication of a New World map in 1507, which showed the New World on the back side of the earth, may have resulted in Copernicus, an astronomer who studied both medicine and law as a young man, being able to take data commonly available for centuries and draw radically new conclusions. In 1543, Copernicus published his book about the solar system, De Revolutionibus, in which he said that earth was not the center of the universe but merely a planet among planets, rotating around the sun. He began the book with an apology for presenting an idea that he knew would seem absurd. He ended the book by warning philosophers and theologians not to meddle in this lest they make fools of themselves.",

He notes that there were major scientific accomplishments at the dawn of what some have called the scientific revolution at the beginning of the 17th century, the likes of which had not been seen in the previous 14 centuries. He also claims that all the very important discoveries were made by a small number of Copernicans, men like Galileo who embraced and were apparently inspired by what Copernicus had done. Margolis says that although Copernicans were still vastly outnumbered at this time, \u201cthey could see that the opposition was in retreat and making a last stand in a bastion that looked ridiculous to Copernicans.\u201d",

In an article on \u201cthe social imperatives of medical research,\u201d however, Eisenberg2 observed that \u201cnot to act is to act.\u201d Table 1\nshows that the history of science has, in fact, been filled with scientists advocating scientific findings that they found to be true before the scientific community was comfortable with their conclusions. Moreover, history shows that other scientists vigorously opposed these new hypotheses. For example, when Paul Lauterbur, the 2003 Nobel laureate in medicine, first published an article on magnetic resonance imaging, he said he was advised by previous Nobel laureates that magnetic resonance imaging would never work. Most of the names listed in Table 1 are probably as well-known as the hypotheses the scientists advocated. A possible exception is Barry Marshall, a recently active scientist who joined the faculty at the University of Virginia a couple of decades ago. He was derided for years for believing something that most specialists in the area considered to be absurd, that a bacterial infection could cause peptic ulcers. I added him to the list because virtually all now recognize that he was right.",

Using this method, Louis found that the time-honored practice of bloodletting, which was known to have been used for at least 24 centuries (since the time of Hippocrates), didn't work. His publication was met with controversy and dismay. It took decades for his work to be accepted as correct and the practice of bloodletting to be abandoned. Louis had many students from both Europe and America, including Oliver Wendell Holmes. Josef Skoda studied under Louis and then taught Semmelweis at the University of Vienna. Louis's numerical method is displayed in Semmelweis's3 most famous study (Table 2\n), which also required decades for acceptance by the medical community. Full acceptance and implementation of la m\u00e9thode num\u00e9rique took quite a few decades.",

The first small open trial using streptomycin showed a case fatality rate of only 50%. This was viewed as miraculous, and it became an accepted therapy with no discussion about or calculation of statistical significance. This was related to me by Dr Thomas Hunter,4 the physician who discovered the synergy between streptomycin and penicillin for treating streptococcal endocarditis in the 1940s.",

There has been political support for investigator-initiated grants dealing with infections, such as malaria or leishmaniasis, that occur predominantly or entirely in third world countries, but not for grants related to nosocomial infection (NI) in American hospitals. A counterexample has been the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support of a Mycosis Study Group for conducting a series of studies of therapy of various fungal infections, some of which were nosocomial. For this reason I wrote to the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases a decade ago, proposing the creation of a Nosocomial Infections Study Group that would have a budget and could distribute public funds for undertaking studies hard to manage without such funding. The reply was that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gets all monies related to that problem area, even though at the time there was no mechanism for individual investigators to submit a grant for extramural funding. This means that funded RCTs for NIs have usually been smaller than might be optimal for statistical power considerations. It also means they have often involved funding by a corporation with a vested interest in the results and thereby may have been subject to the selection of investigators with a track record favorable to the company.",

Three recent meta-analyses compared the results of many RCTs and observational studies examining the same questions and found that the results were generally in agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively.7., 8., 9. For example, Fig 1\noffers a graph from one of these studies showing the point estimates of RCTs and observational studies for several different questions. The authors, a well-known and respected epidemiology group from Yale University, concluded that the results of observational studies did not systematically overestimate or underestimate the effects of an intervention. They also noted that there was sometimes greater variation among the results of RCTs. Some RCTs showed obviously wrong results, if the mean results of all RCTs of the question are taken as mostly likely reflecting truth. This makes it clear that a single study of either type cannot be considered definitive and that consistent results from different studies by different investigators in different populations are needed, as emphasized by Hill. Each of the 3 meta-analyses concluded that randomized trials are the design of choice but found that the data from observational studies of the same question usually yielded comparable results.",

The response was that the topic was not of great interest and that the study probably wouldn't be decisive.

In 1996, CDC issued a new guideline regarding prevention of catheter infections and strongly recommended against scheduled replacement of CVCs, citing the University of Virginia study reporting that it did not work as category IA evidence.11 None of the studies showing that this worldwide practice didn't work were conducted by the CDC or with extramural support from CDC, illustrating the difficulty in getting answers to important questions regarding NIs.",

The third article described 1 of the 2 vancomycin-resistant S aureus cases reported in the United States during 2002.22 Pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed the patient's vancomycin-resistant S aureus to be identical to the methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) of the patient and her friend. Polymerase chain reaction revealed vanA, which on sequencing was identical to the vanA in the patient's Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolate and in transposon TN 1546. The minimal inhibitory concentration to vancomycin was 1,024 \u03bcg/mL, and the authors concluded that \u201cthis finding underscores the importance of extending efforts to prevent and reduce spread of MRSA.\u201d The fourth article reported the results of an RCT of prophylactic intranasal mupirocin to prevent postoperative S aureus infections.23 It found no significant surgical-site infection (SSI) prevention, but power was only 75.6%; among S aureus carriers there was a strong trend toward SSI prevention, and overall postoperative S aureus infections were reduced significantly.

A second study showed that an intraoperative time alert from a computer resulted in a significantly higher rate of redosing when indicated, as recommended by national guidelines.43 The third study reported 28 hepatitis B infections of patients from a hepatitis B\u2013infected surgeon over a 4-year period.44 The surgeon was found to have been carrying hepatitis B at a high level for at least a decade before transmissions began to be recognized. Of note, transmission occurred during both low- and high-risk surgical procedures. A fourth study summarized the documented cases of occupational HIV infection during the first 20 years of the HIV epidemic in the United States, including some despite postexposure prophylaxis.45 A graph in the article showed that transmission to health care workers has been greatly reduced with current control measures. A fifth study suggested that mupirocin doesn't work to eradicate mupirocin-resistant MRSA.46 The authors strongly suggested susceptibility testing. The sixth was another study finding that VRE rates were significantly reduced when both gowns and gloves were worn for care of VRE patients, as compared with when gloves only were worn.47 This study also showed a significant decrease in clonal VRE spread. The seventh study showed a 38-fold higher frequency of nosocomial clonal spread of MRSA when patients were not detected by screening cultures and placed into contact precautions.48 This suggests that standard precautions cannot be relied upon to control nosocomial MRSA spread even in a country like the Netherlands, with optimum antibiotic control and perhaps better overall compliance with hand hygiene.",

It cites more than 40 open trials showing control with this approach. It is posted on the position paper section of the SHEA Web site (www.shea-online.org), which non-SHEA members are welcome to access and print out free of charge. Related information on methods for culture, algorithms for deciding when to culture, and slides for educating health care workers are available at www.pppsite.org. As mentioned earlier, the SHEA guidelines cited more than 40 studies showing control of MRSA and VRE using active surveillance cultures and contact precautions, but 8 more studies showing control of MRSA or VRE with this approach were presented at the national SHEA meeting in Arlington in April 2003.50., 51., 52., 53., 54., 55., 56., 57.\n",

The number has increased in recent years with the arrival of new issues such as smallpox vaccination of health care workers for bioterror preparedness and SARS and monkeypox outbreaks. Nevertheless, there remain significant challenges to the state of the science. Relatively few governmental sources exist for funding of independent, investigator-initiated grants for research regarding the epidemiology, prevention, or management of health care\u2013related infections. As a result, most of aforementioned studies have been conducted on a shoestring budget, using the existing resources of individual hospitals. Many hospitals have recently reduced their support for infection control, and some weren't investing that much to start with. The APIC Research Foundation has traditionally funded very small grants (ie, of a size unlikely to definitively address any question). The CDC has recently advertised the creation of a new office that may someday soon begin accepting grants for conducting research on NIs. The NIH has recently expanded the Mycosis Study Group to include studies of bacterial infections, but has funded very few grants on this topic. The most important resource has been the people in this field who have done a great deal of work over the past 3 decades with very little financial support.",
