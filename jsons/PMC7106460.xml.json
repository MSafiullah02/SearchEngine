Treatment options are limited by increasing antimicrobial-drug resistance. However, new viral infections causing severe respiratory tract disease with pandemic potential have focused global attention.1 A substantial rise in the number of patients with multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis2 and pan-drug-resistant bacteria3 has been noted. Increasing use of immunosuppressive agents, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anticancer agents, coupled with resistance to azoles, has led to an increase in the number of invasive pulmonary fungal infections4 with resultant high morbidity and mortality. Successful treatment outcomes for patients with respiratory tract infections across all health-care settings require appropriate, effective, and pathogen-specific drug or alternative treatments. We describe a range of conventional and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal causes of respiratory tract infections for which new antimicrobial drugs and immune-based and host-directed therapies are being developed and studied.",

Starting of treatment should not be delayed for diagnostic testing. M2 inhibitors\u2014also known as adamantanes\u2014are ineffective against influenza B viruses and recently circulating influenza A H3N2 and 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 viruses, which are resistant because of an S31N mutation in the M2 ion channel.12 However, a proportion of avian influenza A H5N1 strains will be susceptible,14 and the combined use of an adamantane and a neuraminidase inhibitor improves antiviral activity for susceptible isolates.15\n",

By contrast, intravenous zanamivir has been used widely on a compassionate basis since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, particularly for late treatment of critically ill adults with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus infection and those with suspected or proven oseltamivir resistance.31 One trial32 has shown no drug-related trends in safety measures, and a subset of 93 patients positive at baseline for influenza showed a median decrease in nasopharyngeal viral RNA load of 1\u00b742 log10 copies per mL after 2 days of treatment. A phase 3 trial in patients who have been admitted to hospital is underway (NCT01014988).

By contrast with combinations of drugs with differing mechanisms of action, combination of optimum doses of drugs with similar mechanisms of action (eg, dual neuraminidase inhibitors) does not enhance51 antiviral activity and can sometimes result in antagonism.52, 53 A triple combination of antiviral drugs consisting of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir showed synergistic in-vitro activity against influenza A viruses that were susceptible to all three drugs and also those resistant to the amantadine or oseltamivir at baseline, including 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus.51 In a retrospective study53 of critically ill adults, mortality rates did not differ between those who received a triple combination of antiviral drugs and those receiving oseltamivir only, and a randomised controlled trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in higher-risk outpatients is underway (NCT01227969).",

However, survival benefit is unclear,59, 64, 65 and a randomised controlled trial74 done in Hong Kong showed that systemic corticosteroids could delay viral clearance in SARS. A retrospective analysis75 showed worse outcomes when systemic corticosteroids were given in SARS. Consequently, their use should be avoided unless a carefully controlled prospective study is done to test their effectiveness when combined with an antiviral. Several observational studies have shown that systemic corticosteroids given for 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1-asssociated viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome increased the risk of mortality and morbidity (eg, secondary bacterial or fungal infections), especially if there is delay or lack of effective antiviral therapy.45 Use of systemic corticosteroids has probably contributed to delayed viral clearance and emergence of antiviral resistance in patients with severe influenza A H7N9 infection requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.20 Influenza increases the risk of invasive aspergillosis, especially among immunocompromised patients, and this is often a silent infection in the early stages,76 so direct surveillance with aspergillus antigen and PCR testing on respiratory secretions is advisable.

Pathogen-specific T cells can be isolated through use of soluble MHC\u2013peptide complexes, and can immediately be transferred into patients for salvage treatments for viral infections.82 T-cell expansion can also be achieved with several stimuli targeting several infectious pathogens.83 Expansion of T cells targeting several antigens of cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus provides broad antiviral specificity after stem-cell transplantation.84 An alternative approach to become independent of ex-vivo expansion of T cells is the identification of T-cell receptors that would recognise viral infected cells that could be transferred into recipient effector cells.85 T cells can also be engineered to produce an antiviral RNA that would block viral infection.86\n",

Antifungal immune responses could be improved by adaptive transfer of pathogen-specific T cells directed against invasive and pulmonary fungal infections, particularly infections with candida, aspergillus, and mucormycetes, especially after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. T-cell responses are MHC class I restricted (for CD8-positive T cells) or MHC class II restricted (for CD4-positive T cells), and thus an effective T-cell response needs to match the genetic background of the patient. T-cell transfer was developed on the basis of the promising finding that transfer of pathogen-specific T-cell clones induces clinically significant responses.160, 161 Several approaches have been used to obtain these pathogen-specific T cells. Anti-pathogen-specific T cells can be expanded ex vivo under appropriate conditions (usually with the help of recombinant cytokines, synthetic peptides, or cellular components representing the pathogen). Responder T cells are identified by interferon-\u03b3 production, removed via an interferon-capture assay, and transferred into the patient. This approach requires time for expansion of T cells (either the patient's own or those of an MHC-matched donor). This protocol enabled the expansion of Aspergillus spp, Candida spp, and Mucor spp-reactive T cells defined by interferon-\u03b3 production. Upon re-encounter with the nominal target antigen, the T cells proliferated and increased the antifungal reactivity of phagocytes.162\n",

The increasing frequency of antibiotic resistance and limited therapeutic options emphasise the urgent need for more international cooperation to tackle new emerging microbial threats and multidrug-resistant microbes. Development of new therapeutic options needs to be coupled to international regulations on the use and prescription of antimicrobial drugs.",
