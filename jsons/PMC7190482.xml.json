Among repurposed medications evaluated as potential therapies to treat COVID-19 is a combination of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, with mixed results from non-controlled case series of COVID-19 patients.3\n,\n4 Moreover, preclinical studies have suggested that chloroquine may also have a potential prophylactic effect on COVID-19 infections.5 While clinical trials evaluating the efficacy are underway (n = 19; clinicaltrials.gov accessed on 4/22/2020), the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization of chloroquine phosphate from the Strategic National Stockpile to treat adults hospitalized for COVID-19 (04/03/2020).6 However, given emerging evidence which questions whether treatment has favorable risk-benefit, the FDA recommends against use of chloroquine outside hospital settings or clinical trials for COVID-19 patients because of the known QTc prolongation risk (04/24/2020).7\n",

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can be used for malaria prophylaxis, resulting in exposure time during travel with limited ability to capture events that occur outside of the country. Thus, we only included patients with at least one diagnosis of autoimmune diseases (including multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and connective tissue disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and related disorders, psoriasis, myasthenia gravis, nephritis, polyarteritis, autoimmune hepatitis, iridocyclitis, neuropathy, tissue disorders, and skin disorders) to mitigate outcome misclassification. Index date was the antibiotics' initiation date during active chloroquine use. Patients had continuous insurance coverage \u22656 months before index date until 5 days thereafter or inpatient death. We excluded patients with history of HIV, cancer, organ transplant, valvular disorders, cardiomyopathy, pregnancy, malaria, study outcomes, or with any azithromycin or amoxicillin prescription filled during the six months before the index date. We allowed patients to contribute to multiple combination use episodes as long as all in-/exclusion criteria were satisfied. The primary endpoint was sudden cardiac arrest or ventricular arrhythmias (SCA/VA) measured by \u2265 1 International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes (ICD-9-CM 427.5, 427.1, 427.4, 427.41, 427.42, 798, 798.1, 798.2; ICD-10-CM I46, I46.9, I47.2, I49.0, I49.01, I49.02, R99) as principal diagnosis on emergency department (ED) or hospital encounters.11 Our secondary endpoint considered ED or inpatient encounters for cardiac symptoms (syncope, tachycardia, or palpitations: ICD-9-CM 780.2, 785.0, 785.1; ICD-10-CM R55, R00.0, R00.2).10 We followed patients for up to 5 days or until fill of another known QT-prolonging drug8 and estimated outcome incidence rates per 10,000 person-years and hazard ratios (HR). Covariates (including cardiac and metabolic conditions, type of autoimmune disorder, psychiatric conditions, respiratory conditions, infections, a variety of other chronic conditions, history of hospital admissions, smoking, duration of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine use, and history of exposure to other QTc prolongation drugs (known, possible, or conditional risk)) were measured during 6 months before the index date. We adjusted for these covariates via exposure propensity scores using stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting. We conducted two sensitivity analyses that restricted to 1) patients with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus and 2) only the first concomitant use episode.",

A study in Tennessee Medicaid beneficiaries found that azithromycin users had a 2.5 times higher risk of cardiovascular death (95%CI, 1.4\u20134.5) and a 2.0 times higher risk of death from any cause compared to amoxicillin users (95%CI, 1.2\u20133.3).15 In another case-control study using electrocardiogram results and electronic health records, azithromycin users had 43% increased odds of severe QTc prolongation compared to amoxicillin users (95%CI, 1.13\u20131.82).16 In contrast, evidence for adverse cardiac adverse events of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine consists mostly of case series, and the evidence based on more rigorous observational studies is lacking.17\n",

Moreover, doses used in routine care (e.g. for lupus erythematosus, adult dosage is only 125\u2013250 mg chloroquine daily), appear to be lower compared to COVID-19 treatment (1000 mg chloroquine phosphate for day 1 and then 500 mg daily for four to seven days of total treatment),6 which may suggest an attenuated risk for cardiac adverse outcomes.18 Additionally, our study was under the guidance of a prescribing clinician and cannot replicate scenarios where patients self-medicate.

            "text": "There are a several limitations to mention. First, while we addressed confounding via restriction and statistical adjustment, baseline characteristics suggest that chloroquine users with cardiac history were channeled away from azithromycin, and residual confounding may have masked subtle effects. For example, patients with higher risk for cardiac adverse events may be intentionally prescribed other antibiotics when azithromycin would be on option, thus mitigating the effect. Second, we may have underestimated the actual risk of cardiac adverse events among new users of the chloroquine and azithromycin combination, because our population included patients with long-term chloroquine use who may have been tolerating the drug well. Ideally, patients who initiate both drugs simultaneously, as proposed for COVID-19 treatment, would be studied, but restriction our analysis to such a population was prohibitive in terms of sample size. Third, restriction to patients with autoimmune disorders aimed to exclude chloroquine use for malaria prophylaxis with unknown exposure period and incomplete capture of outcomes during travel, but indications can only be inferred from claims data. Fourth, in an attempt to maximize sample size, we expanded a validated ICD-9-CM code set for SVD/VA11 to ICD-10-CM codes, which may have missed or mis-specified events after 2015. We tested our crosswalk in our source dataset and found consistent incidence rates of all endpoints across the ICD transition period. While we have found our code set for cardiac symptoms to be sensitive to capture effects of QTc prolongation in previous studies,10 we are not aware of validation studies.",
