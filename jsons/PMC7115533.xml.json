            "text": "With the 1978 ban on exportation of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) from India, the cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) became an increasingly useful animal model for various diseases, including diabetes, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), tuberculosis, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), renal transplantation, and pharmacodynamic evaluation [1], [2], [3], [4]. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules play key roles in immune regulatory processes by presenting peptides of intracellular or extracellular origin to CD8+ or CD4+ T cells, respectively. It has been suggested that certain co-occurring alleles might be markers of disease risk that have clinical value as biomarkers for targeted screening or the development of new therapies [5]. A number of research groups have suggested that HLA-DRB1/DQB1 and/or HLA class\u03bcalleles and haplotypes are associated with many diseases, including type 1 diabetes [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], pemphigus [11], pure red cell aplasia [12], allergies [13], low hepatitis activity [14], multiple sclerosis [15], primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome [16], Graves' disease in Koreans [17], familial generalized vitiligo and early disease onset [18], lichen sclerosus [19], and rheumatoid arthritis [20], [21]. It has been reported that the combination B*4402-DRB1*1101-DQB1*0301 was associated with an 11-fold increased risk of cervical cell cancer [5].",

            "text": "For a few diseases, in particular SIV infection, macaques have become the dominant preclinical model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine evaluation [22], [23]. There are many reports that show polymorphism of MHC genes in the cynomolgus macaque affects the results obtained with drugs [24], [25], [26] and is associated with the control of viral diseases [27]. The cynomolgus macaque from Mauritius appears to be particularly valuable, because 88% of these animals have the MHC class I allele combination Mafa-A*25-A*29\n[28] and more than half of these have the combination Mafa-B*43010-B*44010-B*460101\n[29]. The increased sharing of the MHC I allele in the Mauritian cynomolgus macaque might dramatically reduce the overall number of animals needed to study cellular immune responses in nonhuman primates and simultaneously reduce the confounding effects of genetic heterogeneity in HIV/AIDS research [28], [29], [30], [31]. The high-frequency alleles might be high-priority targets for additional characterization of the immune function [32]. In addition, co-occurring MHC alleles across loci appear to be more important than individual alleles. So, to examine the combination of MHC class I and class II alleles in a cohort of the Vietnamese cynomolgus macaque, the transcribed Mafa class I and II genes were characterized and analyzed by sequencing the polymorphic exon 2 of Mafa-DRB and Mafa-DQB1 genes and exons 2 and 3 of the Mafa-B gene.",

To identify and investigate the presence and expression of Mafa-B, -DQB1 and -DRB, the first strand cDNA (1 \u03bcl) was amplified in a 25-\u03bcl reaction volume using coding region-specific forward and reverse primers to amplify Mafa-DQB1 and -DRB alleles for exon 2 and Mafa-B for exons 2 and 3 (Table 1). In general, amplification was carried out for 3 minutes at 94\u00b0C, 32 cycles of 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C, 30 seconds at 60\u00b0C, and 1 minute at 72\u00b0C, ending with 3 minutes at 72\u00b0C. The annealing temperature was adjusted based on the T\nm of the primers. The PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining for visualization and were cloned using the PCR cloning kit (Qiagen). After transformation, for each animal, 40 to 50 colonies per locus were picked for plasmid isolation and were bidirectionally sequenced by service provider (Invitrogen, China).",

Surprisingly, we noted that one animal (macaque no. 65) expressed both Mafa-B*008:01 and Mafa-B*017:02 alleles, which were not expressed in the other macaques.

Mauritius cynomolgus macaques might be particularly valuable because more than half of these animals have the MHC class I allele combination Mafa-B*430101, Mafa-B*440101, and Mafa-B*460101. Recognizing that MHC molecules are codominantly expressed, we focused on co-occurring alleles. We investigated the combination of MHC alleles across loci in Vietnamese cynomolgus macaques. Our result showed that both DRB3*0403 and DRB*w304 alleles were detected in the five monkeys (nos. 73, 75, and 78\u201380), both DRB1*1013 and DRB*w304 were detected in the four monkeys (nos. 71, 75, 77, and 80), both DRB*w304 and B*007:01:01 were detected in the four monkeys (nos. 77-80), suggesting the combination of DRB3*0403-DRB*w304, DRB1*1013-DRB*w304 and DRB*w304-B*007:01:01 was in 17%, 13%, and 13% of the animals, respectively (Fig. 2). In addition, some combinations were in 10% of the animals, including DRB1*1503-DRB*w304, DRB1*0616-DRB*w304, DRB1*0616-B*085:01, and DRB1*0616-B*007:01:01 (Fig. 4). Therefore, we conclude that extraordinary MHC class I and II allele sharing is a characteristic feature of Vietnam cynomolgus macaques.",

Both Mafa-DRB*W2101 and Mafa-DRB*W501 alleles were found at low frequency (3%) in the Vietnam cynomolgus macaques bred at Guangdong Province in China; however, the DRB6*0101 allele was not found in this study. It has been documented that MHC alleles/haplotypes were associated with sustained control of SIV-infected cynomolgus/rhesus macaques [22], [23], [30], [31], [46]. It has been shown that Mamu-B*17-positive SIV-infected rhesus macaques that also expressed these two MHC-II alleles had significantly lower viral loads than Mamu-B*17-positive animals that did not express Mamu-DRB1*1003 or -DRB1*0306 (p < 0.0001) [23]. The combination of Mamu-DQB1*0601-DQB1*1801 and Mamu-DQB1*0601-DRB1*0309-DRB*W201 alleles was found to be associated with rapid disease progression in SIV-infected rhesus macaques [22], [46].",

The above high-frequency alleles among Vietnamese population may represent high-priority targets for additional characterization of immune function. Moreover, the combination of DRB3*0403-DRB*w304, DRB1*1013-DRB*w304, and DRB*w304-B*007:01:01 was in 17%, 13%, and 13% of the animals, respectively. In addition, more than two Mafa-DQB1 alleles were found in one particular animal in the present study, suggesting that Mafa-DQB1, as well as Mafa-DRB, might be a duplication in the chromosome. This study is the first to reveal the high frequency of commonly co-occurring class I and class II MHC alleles across loci in a cohort of Vietnamese cynomolgus macaques, greatly enhancing the value of this species as a model for biomedical research.",
