Do you think that emergency physicians have higher or lower risk thresholds than other physicians (eg, internists, pediatricians, neurosurgeons)? Why might this be so? Should our health care system try to align patient and physician acceptable risk thresholds? If so, how might this be achieved?B.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This question was incorrectly worded in the original July 2013 publication. The question has been corrected in these Answers and on the Annals Website. The editors apologize for the error. Assume that 2% of all patients presenting to the ED have a chief complaint of headache, that the percentage of these ED headache patients who have subarachnoid bleeding matches the percentage suggested in the Marks et al paper. Also assume that the 97% sensitivity reported for Mark et al\u2019s decision rule has been externally validated, and that a typical emergency physician treats 3500 patients per year. On average, how many years would an emergency physician have to apply this clinical rule to miss 1 subarachnoid hemorrhage? Do these sound like reasonable numbers to you? Why or why not?C.\nNoncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the brain and lumbar punctures have associated complications. Summarize the reported frequency of complications associated with CT and lumbar puncture. Using the same data listed in question 1B, calculate how often these complications might occur. Does it matter that lumbar puncture-associated complications typically occur acutely, whereas noncontrast CT radiation exposure is associated with late-occurring morbidity and mortality? How might patient age factor into the likelihood of complications associated with CT and lumbar puncture?D.\nIf this clinical rule were widely adopted, in 5 years would you expect that more or fewer patients would be investigated for subarachnoid hemorrhage (the use of similar decision aids in pulmonary embolism may serve as a useful example)?\n2.The authors performed a matched control study.A.\nUnder what circumstances are case-control studies ideal? Consider the time course of exposure and disease, the nature of the exposure and outcomes, and the frequency of the disease.B.\nDiscuss the importance of matching in case-control studies. Why does one match? What should one match on? What should one not match on?C.\nWhy did the authors choose 3 controls for each case? Why not 1? Why not 6?D.\nWhat are the biases of case-control studies in general? In this study specifically?\n3.The authors state, \u201cApproximately 80% of subarachnoid hemorrhage cases are due to ruptured cerebral aneurysms.1\u201dA.\nWhat are other common causes of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage?B.\nIn general terms, describe the sensitivity of a noncontrast head CT in detecting these other etiologies. When choosing a screening test, is it preferable to be highly sensitive or highly specific? What test characteristic (ie, sensitivity, specificity) is desired for a confirmatory study?C.\nAfter a patient complaint about a post-lumbar puncture headache, a hospital administrator proposes that the ED replace lumbar puncture with CT angiography when attempting to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with a negative initial head CT. What do you think about this, assuming the combination of CT and CT angiography is 99% sensitive for diagnosing a subarachnoid hemorrhage, as recently reported2?\n4.The authors performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the rule\u2019s stability using a 1,000-iteration bootstrap analysis.A.\nWhat is a sensitivity analysis? Why are sensitivity analyses often performed in observational studies?B.\nWhat is a bootstrap analysis? Why are bootstrap analyses especially important when evaluating clinical decision rule performance? What assumptions are invoked by bootstrap analyses?\n\n",

Given that emergency physicians often make decisions for strangers with little time to engage in shared decisionmaking, they tend to be overly cautious in risk assessment. Physician risk aversion may be further consolidated and informed by their personal risk tolerance, fear of malpractice, patients\u2019 demands (perceived and real), and their own, as well as society\u2019s, increasing disquiet with uncertainty.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Increased risk tolerance may correlate with the chance of a missed diagnosis or bad outcome. Because these events are often incorrectly attributed to physician error (rather than systems errors) and subject physicians to personal, professional, and legal liabilities, it is not surprising that physicians often practice medicine in a manner that minimizes their personal risk.14\n",

What about for grade 1 splenic lacerations in trauma patients? Clearly these questions are complex and involve multiple competing financial, philosophical, and practical interests. Concurrent with this discussion, physicians themselves would have to define guidelines on how to characterize the risk of a particular clinical scenario, a difficult task, given the amount of both disagreement and lack of accurate risk information that currently exists.3, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Additionally, if they adhered to such guidelines, physicians would have to feel legally protected so they could begin to manage population rather than patient or personal risk.20, 21\n",

This yields 1.75 (3,500\u00d70.02\u00d70.025) patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage seen per year. This figure is then multiplied by the proportion of subarachnoid hemorrhage missed by CT (1\u20130.92=0.08) and then multiplied by the miss rate of the decision rule (1\u20130.97=0.03) to yield 0.0042 (1.75\u00d70.08\u00d70.03) subarachnoid hemorrhage missed per year.25 The inverse of this yields 238 (1/0.0042) years to miss 1 patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage using the clinical decision rule.",

The pediatric risk figure has been reproduced in a recent retrospective cohort study.28 The most common complication associate with lumbar puncture is a postdural headache, which can occur in up to 40% of patients and lasts less than 5 days in 80% of people.29 The risk is highest in the 18- to 30-year-old age group and is much less in children and patients older than 60 years. Low back pain has also been described in up to 35% of patients. Other described complications are much rarer, including transient cranial neuropathies, local infection, meningitis, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid bleeding, and spinal hematoma. The recent deaths associated with contaminated medications remind us that any invasive procedure and routine medication administrations are not without potential severe morbidity and mortality.30, 31, 32\n",

First, it will take many, many years for the lung cancer to develop; the investigator will likely have retired before outcomes data are collected. Second, only a small fraction of smokers (15% at most) ever get lung cancer, meaning that one would need to follow a large cohort to ensure adequate power. Third, keeping contact with persons in the cohort will be difficult and expensive during the 50-year study period; accurately tracking their smoking status during this time may be even more challenging.

Consider the example of cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Let us imagine we were concerned that radon exposure was a confounder because radon causes lung cancer (the confounder is associated with the outcome) and radon exposure may be associated with smoking status (the confounder is associated with the exposure). In a cohort study, we would attempt to match so that that the percentage of persons with radon exposure would be the same in smokers and nonsmokers, thereby reducing the possibility that radon could confound the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. In a case-control study on this topic, we would ensure that there was an equal percentage of persons with radon exposure in the lung cancer and no lung cancer groups. This does not mean that the percentage of persons who were exposed to radon will be the same in smokers and nonsmokers. In fact, we can be assured that the percentage will differ from whatever values those relationships would have had in an unmatched study. Because radon does cause lung cancer, we would expect that the percentage of subjects exposed to radon would be higher in the lung cancer group. By forcing more radon-exposed persons into the non\u2013lung cancer group than normally would have been there, we alter the composition of that group. If there is a positive association between radon exposure and smoking status, then matching will ensure that more people in the control group will smoke, thereby decreasing the crude association of smoking and lung cancer. By stratifying the analysis on radon status, however, we can obtain estimates of the smoking\u2013lung cancer association that are not confounded by radon status. Matching helps because it ensures that there is sufficient balance in the tables to ensure statistical efficiency. Without matching, certain cells may have too few individuals and confidence intervals of the estimates of the odds ratio may be needlessly wide.",

However, at some point making further improvements in the precision of the control estimate adds little to overall precision because the imprecision of the case estimate becomes the limiting factor. As shown in the Figure\n, although adding a second and third control for each case narrows the confidence interval considerably, additional controls provide marginal improvements in precision that are typically not worth the effort. Hence, it is unusual to see a case-control study with more than 3 controls per case.",

In case-control studies, the outcomes are often the easier thing to measure because they are the organizing principle of the study and are the basis for study entry. Exposures, however, have often occurred many years ago and are subject to recall bias. For example, in a study questioning parents of children who had (did not have) a disease about a variety of exposures, the parents of the diseased children have a huge motivation for remembering every detail of the child\u2019s past, whereas control parents have no such motivation. This can lead to differential recall, and this bias can confound study results.",

There is always the risk that the imputation algorithm is making incorrect assumptions about the nature of these patterns. As an illustration, consider variables A, B, and C, all coded as yes or no. In patients with no missing data, those with A and B=no always have C=no. An algorithm might see this and decide that in patients for whom A and B are no and C is missing C is likely no. Although that might be true, it is also possible that whatever made C be missing also makes those patients different in a way that makes it possible that C is yes.

For example, if, for a certain condition, an FP test result can easily be identified as such by a second, inexpensive, harmless test, then an FP is not so bad, and if missing the disease is a bad thing, we would want to avoid FNs much more than FPs. In that case, we would be willing to gain a higher sensitivity at the expense of lower specificity because that combination meets our goal of minimizing FN even if we incur additional FPs. In a different circumstance, however, we might be willing to accept FNs but cannot tolerate FPs and we would choose a cut off point for the test that had a high specificity even if the sensitivity were lower. To recapitulate, there is no way to optimize a test without specifying how one values an FN versus an FP. Articles that claim optimization of sensitivity and specificity without explicitly stating the tradeoff are making an incomplete statement, and those that maximize the sum of sensitivity and specificity are essentially stating that FPs and FNs are equally distasteful, a condition that is seldom true.",

In each bootstrap repetition, the computer selects the same number of patients as were in the original sample, but the computer might select an individual patient 0, 1, or n times. The prediction model is then derived in each bootstrap sample and applied to the bootstrap and original samples. The model\u2019s performance in the bootstrap sample and the original sample reflects the apparent validation and the internal validation, respectively. The difference in these 2 values indicates the estimated optimism of the model\u2019s discrimination.46, 47 This sampling procedure is typically repeated at least 500 to 1,000 times to obtain stable results.48, 49 This optimism value is then subtracted from the apparent performance of the original model derived from the original sample to obtain an optimism-corrected, stable estimate of model performance.46, 47 The bootstrap method is more efficient than the split sample analysis because it permits use of the entire sample for development of the decision rule rather than splitting the sample into 2 smaller derivation and validation groups.44 Furthermore, the bootstrap validation method has been shown to appropriately reflect all sources of model uncertainty, including variable selection.47\n",
