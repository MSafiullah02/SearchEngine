Infected individuals can be contagious prior to exhibiting symptoms, which has led to an exponential rise in disease prevalence. The Centers for Disease Control recommends that people in the general population maintain a distance of 2 m from others to avoid infection via respiratory droplets, and wash hands frequently to avoid infection via fomites (2).",

Clinical review at the trainee's workstation presents concerns regarding person-to-person distancing; touching the trainee's keyboard and mouse presents an opportunity for the inadvertent spread of pathogens. Collocation of the trainees and staff in a confined reading room is no longer desirable, as we endeavor to provide physical distance between individuals. Social distancing has further eroded the personal connection in didactic lectures, as teachers must now find ways to connect with dispersed learners both within and outside of a medical center.",

            "text": "To address these concerns, we adapted our existing enterprise-wide communication software (Skype for Business, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) as a one-stop solution. Because this software is already installed and supported on all enterprise computers, there is minimal technical overhead and no expense. All means of communication (messaging, audio calls, and video calls) are accessed from the workstation and all department members can be quickly reached through a single interface, independent of their location. The dictation handset (Nuance PowerMic, Nuance Communications, Burlington, MA) doubles as a microphone and speaker for telephony. Conferences are presented through the same interface and can be archived using the software, so that trainees can review lectures. As a novel solution to improving didactic review of cases with the trainees, we have made use of the \u201cpresent desktop\u201d and \u201crequest control\u201d capabilities of this communication tool. While viewing a case, either the attending or the resident can share their screen and both physicians can control the mouse, scroll through the images and point out salient findings, while conversing in real time with each other (Fig 1\n). As most radiology and nuclear medicine review stations have multiple video monitors, the user can either move images to the shared screen or toggle the \u201cpresent desktop\u201d to a different monitor. This method is far superior to our previous experience where the trainee and attending physician reviewed the images separately on their workstations while trying to describe findings over the telephone.",
