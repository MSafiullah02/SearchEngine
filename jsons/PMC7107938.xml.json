Two major differences exist between hMPV and hRSV genomes: the gene order is different, and hMPV does not contain nonstructural genes (figure 2) [10]. The possible relevance of the absence of these viral proteins, which have been associated with IFN antagonism by hRSV [11], deserves additional study. For hRSV, the G and F surface proteins are known as the major protective antigens [11], and this also needs to be verified for hMPV.",

For instance, the amino acid sequence identity between hMPV strains and APV-C and hRSV representatives varies from 66% to 89% and from 23% to 43%, respectively, when comparing the N, P, M, and F genes [4, 12]. The SH and G amino acid sequences of hMPV show important variability and share only 28% and 21% identity with their respective APV-C counterparts [8, 13, 14]. It is possible that this important divergence may account for the specific host range of these 2 related metapneumoviruses. Genetic analysis on a large number of hMPV isolates has identified 2 major groups and 2 minor genetic clusters within each group [6, 7]. However, additional investigations are still required to determine whether these genotypes represent different antigenic groups. Recently, the complete nucleotide sequences of hMPV isolates belonging to these 2 major groups were determined [9]. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities between the 2 hMPV groups were found to be 80% and 90%, respectively, which is similar to what has been reported with hRSV A and B genotypes.",

            "text": "Since its initial report by the Dutch researchers in 2001, hMPV has been found in most parts of the world, with reports from North America (United States and Canada), Europe (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Finland), Asia (Hong Kong and Japan), and Australia (table 1). The virus has also been identified in HIV-infected and nonimmunocompromised children from South Africa [15]. The few seroprevalence surveys from The Netherlands [4], Japan [16], and Israel [17] have indicated that virtually all children are infected by 5\u201310 years of age. In addition, studies have shown that hMPV is not a new pathogen, with serological evidence of human infection dating from 1958 in The Netherlands [4] and viral isolation for the past 10\u201320 years in Europe and Canada [4, 7]. Cases of severe hMPV infection in adults [7] and of reinfection in immunocompromised subjects [18] suggest that, despite universal infection in childhood, new infections can occur throughout life due to incompletely protective immune responses and/or acquisition of new genotypes. Surveys have indicated that hMPV has a seasonal distribution overlapping hRSV circulation, with most cases reported during the winter/early spring months (table 1). Although most studies have limited their surveillance to the typical respiratory virus period, our group has shown that 87% of hMPV isolates recovered in cell culture in Quebec, Canada, were recovered during the period of December through May [7]. In addition, we found that outbreaks of hMPV infection tend to peak in early spring over a 4\u20136 week period, slightly later than outbreaks of hRSV infection, which also are more spread out in time [19]. However, additional studies over multiple years are needed to better define the seasonality of hMPV infection.",

The relative role of hMPV in respiratory syndromes of adults has been less studied. In one study from Rochester, New York, hMPV was detected by serological tests and/or RT-PCR in 4.5% of young and elderly adults with ARTI [21]. Interestingly, evidence of hMPV infection was also found by serological testing in almost the same percentage (4.1%) in asymptomatic adults, raising the question of the causative role of hMPV in ARTI in adults. Recent studies by our group indicate that hMPV is rarely identified by RT-PCR in NPAs obtained from asymptomatic young children, with a rate significantly lower than that of subjects with ARTI (<1% vs. 6%) [19, 22]. It is interesting to note that the rates of detection of hMPV have been generally higher in retrospective than prospective studies (table 1), an observation consistent with some selection bias. Thus, to better define the role of hMPV in various respiratory conditions, large prospective studies using appropriate controls need to be conducted. In addition, testing of all clinical samples (i.e., not only those samples that are found to be negative for other viruses) must be performed. Nevertheless, most studies have so far indicated that hMPV is a frequent cause of severe ARTI, especially in young children.",

Symptoms of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections have been associated with hMPV in young children, although most reports are biased towards description of the most severe symptomatology in hospitalized subjects. In young hospitalized children, the clinical features associated with hMPV infections are very similar to those of hRSV [19, 23\u201325]. Diagnoses of bronchiolitis, with or without pneumonitis, have been most commonly reported. A substantial proportion (up to 50%) of infected children also has concomitant otitis media [19]. Acute wheezing and asthma exacerbation have been associated with hMPV in some [23, 26] but not all [27] studies. Compared with hRSV infections, hMPV cases tend to occur at an older age [19, 26, 28]. The clinical outcome after hRSV infection has been more severe than that after hMPV infection when looking at the proportion of patients with hypoxemia, those with pneumonia, and those admitted to the intensive care unit in studies from Canada [19] and Europe [25, 28]. In contrast, researchers from Hong Kong found that hMPV infection was associated with a longer hospital stay and more cases of pneumonia than was hRSV infection [26]. The latter group reported an estimate of 442 hMPV-associated hospitalizations per 100,000 children aged \u2a7d6 years. Children with underlying medical conditions may have more-severe hMPV disease, leading to hospitalization. In studies from North America, 25%\u201333% of hMPV cases occurred in children with underlying conditions, such as prematurity, cardiopulmonary problems, and immunosuppression [7, 29].",

Among 10 retrospectively identified, infected patients aged >65 years who were hospitalized at our institution, 4 developed pneumonitis and 2 died (table 2) [7].

Although no autopsy was performed, an NPA obtained before death revealed the presence of hMPV only. Of interest, this child had presented with a first episode of bronchiolitis caused by hMPV 1 year earlier, and the 2 viral isolates were of different lineages (groups), highlighting the possibility of rapid reinfections in immunocompromised hosts.

Most studies have reported reliable cytopathic effects only in tertiary monkey kidney or LLC-MK2 cells [4, 6, 7]. The cytopathic effect is variable, with some strains inducing hRSV-like syncytia formation and others inducing focal rounding and cell destruction (figure 3). Typically, the cytopathic effect is displayed more than 10\u201314 days after inoculation (mean time was 17 days in our laboratory). Confirmation of hMPV cytopathic effect is achieved by RT-PCR testing of infected supernatants in the absence of commercially available antibodies. A recent report by Chan et al. [34] indicated that hMPV could replicate more efficiently in human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cells, despite the absence of cytopathic effect. In that instance, presence of hMPV was confirmed by direct testing of HEp-2 cell culture supernatants by RT-PCR or subsequent passage on LLC-MK2 cells to observe cytopathic effect.",

Most PCR protocols reported to date have relied on amplification of the L, N, or F gene (reviewed in [37]), with primer sequences mainly derived from the prototype strain 001 from The Netherlands (GenBank accession number AF371337). Because of the existence of 2 hMPV lineages with significant genetic variability within each group, hMPV detection may be underestimated when inadequate primers are selected for PCR amplification. We have recently reported that RT-PCR assays targeting the N and L genes, which code for 2 internal viral proteins, are best suitable for hMPV diagnosis [37]. Rapid and sensitive hMPV assays based on the real-time PCR methodology have recently been described, allowing amplification and detection of this pathogen in \u2a7d2 h [37, 38].",

A home-brew ELISA method has also been developed using cell lysates of hMPV [21].

In contrast, no activity against hMPV was conferred by palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F protein of hRSV. Despite the unavailability of animal studies and the toxicity related to ribavirin administration, the combined use of IVIG and ribavirin could be envisaged for treating severe hMPV infection in immunocompromised patients, as has been reported for hRSV infection [40, 41]. Furthermore, until an effective vaccine is developed, another interesting strategy could consist in the development of high-titered IVIG preparations with activity against hMPV.",

Overall, the epidemiological and clinical features of hMPV infection appear to be similar to those of hRSV, although differences have been noted. It is important to mention that many fundamental questions related to viral pathogenesis and the host's specific immune response still remain to be answered.",
