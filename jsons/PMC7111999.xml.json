SG RNAs as considered in this review, have the following properties: (i) they are made in infected cells but do not interfere with the normal course of viral replication; (ii) the SG RNA sequences are shorter than their cognate genomic RNAs; (iii) their sequences are usually co-terminal with the 3\u2032 genomic sequence but sometimes are co-terminal with the 5\u2032 sequences. Yet other viruses make SG RNAs which contain a 5\u2032 co-terminal leader joined to a 3\u2032 co-terminal sequence; (iv) typically, whether a messenger SG RNA contains only one ORF, or multiple ORFs, with some rare exceptions (Dorokhov et al., 2006), only the 5\u2032 ORF is translated (Pasternak et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2009). Although most SG RNAs function as messengers and are translated, other SG RNAs, generally those with 5\u2032 co-terminal sequences, have other functions.",

            "text": "Following the synthesis of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), the (+) strand RNA is copied into a genome-length (\u2212) strand which then serves as a template for the genomic (G) and the SG (+) strand RNAs (Fig. 1A). Thus, the (\u2212) strand RNA contains at least two different promoters, one for the synthesis of G RNA at or near the 3\u2032 end, and one or more internal or subgenomic promoters (SGPs). To synthesize a SG RNA, the viral RDRP recognizes and binds to the SGP and initiates transcription (Koev and Miller, 2000). This mechanism was first found with BMV, a tripartite plant virus. The (\u2212) strand of dicistronic BMV RNA 3 serves as template for transcription of the 3\u2032 co-terminal SG RNA4 due to de novo internal initiation from the SGP. The BMV SGP has been mapped to the sequence from nt \u2212 95 to + 16 (Fig. 2A). Its modular composition includes an AU-rich enhancing region, a poly (U) tract, a core region, the + 1 C transcription initiation site, and a downstream sequence (Wierzchoslawski et al., 2004). The enhancing region (nts \u2212 95 to \u2212 20) greatly increases the amount of SG RNA 4. The core region (nts \u2212 19 to \u2212 1) contains a stem-loop (SL) structure which is responsible for RDRP binding. Adkins and Kao (1998) have suggested an induced fit mechanism whereby the RDRP recognizes key nucleotides, after which nucleotide base-pairing occurs and the SL structure forms. Another model proposes that the SL structure binds to the RDRP complex, after which the key nucleotides stabilize the hairpin (Haasnoot et al., 2000, Haasnoot et al., 2002). Regardless of the mechanism, internal initiation appears to be a multi-step process, which involves both host and viral proteins (Hertz and Huang, 1995a, Hertz and Huang, 1995b, Adkins and Kao, 1998, Haasnoot et al., 2002, Sivakumaran et al., 2004). Other (+)-strand RNA viruses use SGPs with a similar organization (Miller and Koev, 2000, Haasnoot et al., 2000, Morales et al., 2004, Olsthoorn et al., 2004).",

Three of these SG RNAs are co-terminal with the 3\u2032 terminus of the genomic RNA; the smallest SG RNA has only one ORF, and encodes CP. The middle-sized SG RNA has two ORFs (for MP and CP), but only the 5\u2032 ORF, that for MP, is expressed. The third and largest SG RNA, referred as the I1, has been detected in TMV-infected tobacco tissue. It contains in addition to ORFs for MP and CP, a 5\u2032 ORF for a 54-kDa protein with a sequence identical to that of the read-through region of the 183-kDa replicase. Interestingly, RNA structures that are able to regulate the activity of TMV promoters can be far removed from the initiation site. Culver et al. (1993) found that the location of the TMV SGP in relation to the 3\u2032 UTR is a crucial factor in enhancing expression. Later, Szecsi et al., 1999, Shivprasad et al., 1999 associated the positive effect of the 3\u2032 UTR with the three pseudoknots contained therein; these were found to redistribute RDRP activity localizing most of it to the nearest SGP promoter.",

In the case of the TMV promoter for the middle-sized SG RNA (Fig. 2B), computer analysis predicted two stem-loop structures (SL1 and SL2) upstream of the transcription start site. The SL1 secondary structure, rather than its sequence, was critical for promoter activity. On the other hand, removal of most of the SL2 region increased accumulation of the SG RNA four-fold (Grdzelishvili et al., 2000). Also, the three SGP promoters of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) fold into different size stem-loops downstream of their respective initiation sites (Koev and Miller, 2000). In the case of promoters of Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) SG RNAs \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b3, the conservation of both the sequences and the secondary structures appear to be important for their activity (Johnson et al., 2003).

Initiation from the 3\u2032 end of the (\u2212) sense genomic BMV RNA obeys different rules than does the initiation of SG RNA (Stawicki and Kao, 1999), likely due to additional factors (Diez et al., 2000) that can adjust the properties of the RDRP (Adkins and Kao, 1998, Ranjith-Kumar et al., 2003, Haasnoot et al., 2002, Sivakumaran et al., 2004).",

            "text": "In studies of FHV RNA replication in yeast (Lindenbach et al., 2002), two cis-acting elements were found in RNA 1 (Fig. 3C): (i) a proximal subgenomic control element (PSCE) extends from nt 2282 to nt 2777 (the start site for the synthesis of SG RNA 3 is at nt 2721), and (ii) a distal subgenomic control element (DSCE) from nt1229 to nt 1239. Base pairing between the nt sequence 1229 to 1239 in the DSCE and both a 6 nt sequence and a 4 nt sequence (almost 200 nt apart) in the PSCE is required for the synthesis of RNA 3. For the most efficient synthesis of RNA 3, the PSCE sequence between nt 2302 and 2777 was needed; however some synthesis was seen with the 5\u2032 limit of the PSCE at nt 2518. Thus, the region from nt 2302 to 2518 serves as an enhancer. Disruption of PSCE/DSCE base pairing increased the amount of RNA 1 made, but then neither (+) nor (\u2212) strand RNA 3 was made. Apparently, the long distance interaction between DSCE and PSCE gives rise to a secondary or tertiary structure that results in premature termination when (\u2212) strand RNA 1 is made. In addition, work by Eckerle et al. (2003), strongly suggests that the (+) and (\u2212) strands of RNA 3 participate in a full-fledged RNA 3 replication even in the absence of RNA 1. Furthermore, as with the synthesis of RNA 1 and RNA 2, the synthesis of (+) strand FHV RNA 3 great exceeds that of (\u2212) strand RNA. Finally, in this system, RNA 3 is required for the synthesis of RNA 2, and once RNA 2 is made, it suppresses the synthesis of RNA 3.",

            "text": "\nTomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) uses a similar strategy to make SG RNAs (Fig. 3B) (White and Nagy, 2004, Zhang et al., 2004). While making (\u2212) strand RNA, the RDRP complex terminates at the promoter regions for (+) sense SG RNAs, generating the subviral-length (\u2212) sense 3\u2032 SG RNAs (White, 2002), which then act as templates to amplify the (+) sense 3\u2032 SG RNA. Substitution of the transcription-initiating nucleotides for SG RNA 1 or 2 inhibits the accumulation of these RNAs, but not of the corresponding (\u2212) sense SG RNA templates (White, 2002). Additionally, TBSV RDRP can be considered as the essential catalytic complex regulating viral replication and SG RNA transcription. Wu and White (2007) have shown that both processes can be effectively uncoupled in vivo by deletion of up to five C-terminal RDRP residues. Subsequently, the replicase C-terminus was proposed to function at an early step of the PT transcriptional pathway mediating (i) efficient production of minus-strand templates for SG RNA production; (ii) accurate termination of minus strands, and (iii) efficient utilization of the SGP promoter (Wu and White, 2007). The RDRP termination depends on a multicomponent RNA attenuation signal that includes: (i) long distance RNA\u2013RNA interactions (Fig. 3C), (ii) the spacer segments between the 5\u2032 receptor sequences (RS) and transcriptional initiation sites and (iii) the corresponding downstream sequences predicted to contain transcriptional promoter elements (Lin and White, 2004, Lin et al., 2007). The long-distance base pairings between 5\u2032 receptor sequences (RS1 and RS2) in SGP promoters of RNA1 and 2, and the activator sequences (AS1 and AS2) in the coding region of p92, as well as between the 5\u2032 distal element (DE) of SGP promoter of RNA2 and the complementary downstream core element A (CE), form a physical barrier during (\u2212) strand synthesis (Fig. 3B) (Wang et al., 2008). The first two of these interactions span over 1 and 2 kb, respectively, and the distance between these various structures affects the termination efficiency (Lin et al., 2007).",

The PVX SG RNA production is regulated in cis by conserved octanucleotide sequences located upstream of the two PVX SGP promoters, as well as by complementary elements in the genomic 5\u2032 UTR (Kim and Hemenway, 1999). On the other hand, Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) exploits an in trans bimolecular interaction to stall and dislodge the replicase complex during (\u2013)-strand synthesis (Fig. 3D) (Guenther et al., 2004, Tatsuta et al., 2005). RCNMV possesses a bipartite genome with SG RNA being synthesized from RNA1. The synthesis of the SG RNA requires a trans-activation by an RNA hairpin structure located in RNA2 (see below) (Guenther et al., 2004). Specifically, this activation involves the loop portion of an SL structure in RNA2 (trans-activator or TA) which base-pairs with a complementary sequence in RNA1 (TA binding site or TABS) that is located upstream from the SG RNA transcription initiation site (Fig. 3D) (Guenther et al., 2004). It has been suggested that protein factors may bind to and stabilize the bimolecular RNA\u2013RNA contact. Interestingly, the disruption of the RNA\u2013RNA interaction does not affect replication of RCNMV genomic components (Tatsuta et al., 2005). Thus, intermolecular communication secures the switching between replication and transcription, resolving the problem of their mutual interference.",

An extended SL RNA structure positioned 5\u2032 to the initiation site for SG RNA2 was found to mediate PT mechanism by functioning in the (+) strand of the viral genome.

The 3\u2032-ends of both SG RNAs terminate at two SL structures: SL1 and SL2, with the transcription initiation site for the 3\u2032 SG RNAs located in the loop region of SL2 (Tatineni et al., 2009). Likewise, CTV terminates one of its 5\u2032 SG RNAs (referred as low-molecular-weight tristeza LMT1) at the two SL structures located upstream of the internal initiation site for the 3\u2032 SG RNA (Gowda et al., 2003).",

A special feature of these (+)- strand RNA viruses is that they encode a nested set of SG RNAs which vary in size, but all of which have a 3\u2032 sequence co-terminal with the 3\u2032 end of the G RNA. These SG RNAs encode the structural proteins and in the case of the Coronaviruses, also several proteins accessory to the replicase proteins. Except for the smallest SG RNAs, all contain multiple open ORFs, but in each case only the 5\u2032 ORF is translated. Thus, although most of these SG RNAs are structurally polycistronic, functionally they are monocistronic.",

The explanation for how in a SG RNA a 5\u2032 leader is joined to a 3\u2032 terminal sequence remained controversial for some years. Models were proposed that suggested discontinuous synthesis of RNA transcripts, but this then raised the question as to whether the discontinuous synthesis occurred during (+) or (\u2212) strand syntheses (Pasternak et al., 2006). The first model, known as the leader-primed transcription model (Fig. 1C), proposed that transcription would start by copying the 3\u2032 end of the G RNA (\u2212) strand RNA thereby giving rise to a 5\u2032 leader sequence; it followed that the discontinuous step would occur during the synthesis of (+) strand RNA. However, the finding of multiple species of (\u2212) strand RNAs, the sizes of which corresponded to the sizes of the SG RNAs, provided strong support for the proposal by Sawicki and Sawicki (1995) that discontinuous synthesis of SG RNA occurred at the level of (\u2212) strand RNA synthesis (Fig. 1D). These (\u2212) strand RNAs would then serve as the templates for the SG RNAs. This is now the generally accepted model.",

The TRSs containthree sequence blocks: the core sequence (CS) and the 5\u2032-TRS and 3\u2032-TRS flanking sequences (Fig. 4\n) (Alonso et al., 2002). The CS includes six nucleotides that are highly conserved in each TRS of any given Coronavirus. The most frequently used core sequences of Coronaviruses, i.e. those belonging to Group 1 (hexamer 5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032) and Group 2 (heptamer 5\u2032-UCUAAAC-3\u2032) share homology, while the CS of Coronavirus belonging to Group 3 (e.g. infectious Bronchitis virus coronavirus [IBV]) has the most divergent sequence (5\u2032-CUUAACAA-3\u2032). The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking regions, which are partially conserved in the different genes of related viruses, influence the activity of the CS (Alonso et al., 2002). The TRS at the 3\u2032 end of the 5\u2032 leader sequence is referred to as the leader TRS (L-TRS), whereas TRSs located at the 5\u2032 end of each gene downstream of the genes coding for the replicase proteins are referred to as body TRSs (B-TRSs). These findings suggested that the TRS elements are involved in discontinuous transcription.",

In some cases, e.g. for purposes of replication, the RDRP complex makes a complete (\u2212) strand copy of the genome which serves as template for the synthesis of full-length (+) strand G RNA. In other cases, i.e. for making SG RNAs, (\u2212) strand RNA synthesis begins, but stalls after copying one of the body TRSs in the viral genome. This (\u2212) strand TRS at the 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA then base pairs with the (+) strand TRS at the 3\u2032 end of the leader sequence, facilitating translocation of the nascent (\u2212) strand RNA to the 5\u2032 end of the genome where the RDRP complex copies the leader sequence to the end of the genome (Sawicki et al., 2001, Pasternak et al., 2001, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2004). The various (\u2212) strand SG RNAs made in this fashion serve as templates for the synthesis of the same-length (+) strand SG mRNAs and/or the production of shorter internally nested SG RNAs (Wu and Brian, 2010). The latter mechanism would likely contribute to the greater abundance of the 3\u2032 co-terminal SG RNAs.",

The level of SG RNA production by both Arteriviruses and Coronaviruses was shown to depend upon the efficiency of interactions between L-TRS and B-TRS (Pasternak et al., 2001, Pasternak et al., 2003, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2004, Sola et al., 2005). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the L\u2013B TRS junctions occur at multiple sites, with a preference for 3\u2032 proximal nucleotides within the B-TRS (van der Most et al., 1994). With Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), it has been shown that sequences flanking the core TRS influence transcription of the SG RNAs (Curtis et al., 2004, Sola et al., 2005). Among Nidovirales, the 3\u2032 end of the G RNA is critical for SG RNA transcription. In MHV, the 300 nt 3\u2032 UTR promotes transcription (Lin et al., 1996), but only the 3\u2032 55 nts are required for (\u2212) strand RNA synthesis. It was also shown that mutations disrupting the U-turn motif of the 5\u2032 UTR stem-loop 2 (SL2) affected SG RNA synthesis, suggesting that SL2 mediates specific interactions with viral and/or cellular proteins involved in the synthesis of SG RNAs (Liu et al., 2007). In general, the 5\u2032 UTRs of Coronavirus RNAs fold into similar secondary structures containing three to four SL structures that include a highly conserved 5 nt hairpin loop SL2 with a U-turn motif; SL1 and SL2 are close to each other (shown in Liu et al., 2007). The polypyrimidine-tract binding (PTB) protein hnRNPI may play a role in the regulation of SG RNA transcription due to its ability to interact with short pyrimidine-rich tracts, e.g. UCU, or CUCU. Since the 5\u2032 UTR SL2 contains UCUAA repeats, PTB binding might assist circularization of the viral genome and aid template switching during discontinuous SG RNA synthesis (Choi et al., 2002, Oberstrass et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Related to the discontinuous mechanism is the question of how the synthesis of SG RNAs is regulated, and how the ratios of the different SG RNAs to each other are maintained. To address this problem, studies were carried out on the nsp1 protein of both EAV and MHV (Tijms et al., 2001, Donaldson et al., 2007). This protein contains a zinc-binding domain that assists in RNA-protein interactions and regulates the replication/transcription balance (Tijms et al., 2001). The EAV nsp1 proteininteracts with p100-binding polypeptide (p100BP) which co-functions with the RNA polymerase II transcription factor c-Myb. It has been speculated that the nsp1-p100BP interaction is important for SG RNA synthesis, either directly or by recruiting another protein to the viral RDRP complex. Alternatively, nsp1 might modulate transcription in the infected cell, explaining its targeting to the nucleus (Tijms and Snijder, 2003). Similarly, a deficiency in nucleocapsid protein (N) of Human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) impaired RNA replication, but not transcription, demonstrating that N protein regulates the equilibrium between these two processes (Schelle et al., 2005).",

BTEs as cap-independent translation elements can be characterized by two structural features: (i) a conserved 17 nt sequence, that includes a stem loop (SL-I) with a GN RNA loop motif, and (ii) a loop (not in SL-I) that can base pair to a loop in the 5\u2032UTR of the RNA (Kneller et al., 2006). It has been proposed that the premature addition of SG RNA2, which contains the 5\u2032 UTR BTE, regulates BYDV replication by inhibiting translation of the viral polymerase from genomic RNA (G RNA). Thus, the G RNA ceases to function as a messenger and instead functions as a template for replication (Shen and Miller, 2004).",

The 5\u2032 SG RNA can serve as a template for expression of viral protein, e.g. movement protein in BMV, which sets the genomic RNA free for more efficient replication, recombination and packaging (Gowda et al., 2003). As with BYDV SG RNA 2, the early addition of the 5\u2032 co-terminal SG RNA3a reduced BMV RNA replication in barley protoplasts (J. Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska and J.J. Bujarski, unpublished). In contrast, the in planta experiments showed a dose\u2013dependent bell-shaped response in which high concentrations of SG RNA3a reduced virus yield. We speculate that the translation of minute amounts of initial SG RNA3a leads to an excess of MP which facilitates the viral spread. At higher doses the SG RNA3a may, however, act as a molecular decoy that sequesters translational factors, reducing translation of replicase proteins (J. Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska and J.J. Bujarski, unpublished).",

For instance, the transcription mechanism in Nidovirales, involving leader\u2013body TRS duplex formation together with distinct cis-acting signals that affect the nascent strand transfer during SG RNAs production, resembles the copy-choice RNA recombination (Figs. 1C and D) (van Marle et al., 1999, Pasternak et al., 2006). The high recombination frequencies in Coronaviruses and Arteriviruses have been associated with the highly structured 3\u2032 UTRs in the genomes of these viruses (Molenkamp et al., 2000, Pasternak et al., 2000, Pasternak et al., 2001).

Much also remains to be learned about the particular mechanisms of SG RNAs synthesis and why certain SG RNAs are more robust messengers than other SG RNAs or than the G RNA.

These compounds appear to act by preferential inhibition of synthesis of SG RNAs. Although the exact mechanism is not known, one possibility is that they bind to sites on the RDRP that recognize the SGPs.",

This approach has already found use in regulating the function of the higher-order component of the attenuation signal allowing the control ofTBSV SG RNA transcription (Wang and White, 2007, Wang et al., 2008) and it offers further promising ways for the analysis and modulation of viral processes at either the level of SG RNA transcription or translation.",

The continual emergence of new recombinant strains, e.g. HCoV-NL63 and HCoVHKU1 isolated in the wake of SARS (van der Hoek et al., 2004), and SARS-like Coronaviruses isolated from animal reservoirs (Li, et al., 2005b), raises the question of the role of SG RNAs in the reshuffling of genome sequences of Corona- and other viruses. Clearly, by incorporating foreign sequences into their genomes, certain viruses acquire new surprising properties (Pasternak et al., 2006, Moreno et al., 2008a). For example, the Closterovirus SG RNA-expressed HSP70h, that facilitates viral assembly and cellular movement, has likely been captured from the host (Prokhnevsky et al., 2005). The Coronavirus SG RNA-expressed hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), acting as a receptor-binding fusion protein, likely originated from Orthomyxoviruses (Zeng et al., 2008).",
