The first IVIG was produced by pepsin digestion and contained a principal fragment with two antigen binding sites linked by disulfide bonds.7\n",

Virus inactivation of albumin by heat treatment was possible because of the discovery that addition of stabilizers increased the heat resistance of albumin. Human albumin has many binding sites for hydrophobic molecules and plays a major role in the transport of fatty acids. Filling these sites with the stabilizers acetyltryptophan and caprylic acid allows albumin to withstand heating for 10 hours at 60\u00b0C. Since albumin has no measurable biological activity, the full impact of heating albumin is not known.",

A sensitive test for HBV was developed in 197250 and was used to eliminate infected donors. Unfortunately, the HBV test did not eliminate transfusion-related hepatitis and the search for one or more non-A, non-B hepatitis viruses was initiated. The AIDS epidemic led to rapid development of a screening test for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1984.51 In 1989 the genome of a non-A, non-B hepatitis virus was isolated and used to develop a donor screening test for HCV.52 Today, plasma is screened for antibodies to syphilis, HIV-1, HIV-2, and HCV, and for HBV and HIV antigens. Extremely sensitive tests for HCV, HIV-1, HBV, and parvovirus B19 nucleic acids have recently been introduced and are now being used to further eliminate window period donations.",
