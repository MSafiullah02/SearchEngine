An external trigger is needed to promote the drastic conformational changes necessary for the fusion subunit to fold into the low-energy, 6-helix bundle. These triggers typically facilitate pH-independent entry at the plasma membrane or pH-dependent entry in a low-pH endosomal compartment. The \u2423-retrovirus avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV) has a rare, 2-step entry mechanism with both pH-dependent and pH-independent features. Here, we present the 2.0-\u00c5-resolution crystal structure of the ASLV transmembrane (TM) fusion protein. Our structural and biophysical studies indicated that unlike other pH-dependent or pH-independent viral TMs, the ASLV fusion subunit is stable irrespective of pH. Two histidine residues (His490 and His492) in the chain reversal region confer stability at low pH. A structural comparison of class I viral fusion proteins suggests that the presence of a positive charge, either a histidine or arginine amino acid, stabilizes a helical dipole moment and is a signature of fusion proteins active at low pH. The structure now reveals key residues and features that explain its 2-step mechanism, and we discuss the implications of the ASLV TM structure in the context of general mechanisms required for membrane fusion.-Aydin, H., Smrke, B.M., Lee, J.

This process is mediated by one or more virionattached envelope glycoproteins (Envs; refs. 1, 2), classified into 3 groups (class I, II, and III) based on structural characteristics (3, 4) . Many of the world's greatest viral threats, such as paramyxo-, orthomyxo-, filo-, corona-, arena-and retroviruses, display glycoproteins belonging to the class I family. Class I Envs are initially translated as a single polypeptide chain with a type I transmembrane anchor (5, 6) .

In the pH-independent mechanism, such as those employed by retro-, corona-, or paramyxoviruses, receptor binding by the attachment subunit triggers conformational changes in the Env to mediate the fusion event (9) . In contrast, for pH-dependent viral entry, such as those employed by flavi-, arena-, or influenza A viruses (IAVs), the acidic environment of the endosome triggers the Env conformational changes (10, 11) . Following triggering, structural constraints on the hydrophobic fusion peptide or loop is released to allow its insertion into the target host membrane to form an extended prehairpin intermediate. Class I viral fusion proteins are thought to adopt a central trimeric \u2423-helical structure at the prehairpin intermediate state where its N-terminal end is anchored to the target host lipid bilayer and the C-terminal end embedded in the viral membrane. Multiple fusion proteins may be necessary to anchor and complete the membrane merger process. Subsequently, conformational changes to the fusion subunit allow the prehairpin intermediate to collapse. The C-terminal hydrophobic helical region folds back and packs against the central trimeric \u2423-helical structure. As the extended prehairpin intermediate folds up, this brings both the viral and host membranes together to promote mixing of the two outer leaflets and the formation of the hemifusion intermediate. The formation of the final low-energy, postfusion 6-helix bundle then completes the formation of the fusion pore. The fusion of two lipid bilayers is a thermodynamically feasible process but comes with a high energetic price. The free energy released from the conformational changes of the prefusion glycoprotein to the low-energy 6-helix bundle drives the fusion reaction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 181, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 395, "end": 398, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 596, "end": 600, "text": "(10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 601, "end": 604, "text": "11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Interestingly, the \u2423-retrovirus avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV) enters cells through a rare, 2-step mechanism that has characteristics of the entry mechanisms of disparate viruses, such as HIV-1 and IAV (12, 13) . The unique mechanism of ASLV entry makes it an excellent model system to study the general viral entry processes (12) . ASLV Env contains an N-terminal SU subunit that is involved in receptor binding and a C-terminal TM subunit that contains the fusion machinery (14 -16) . The receptor for the ASLV subgroup A is Tva, a protein that belongs to the low-density lipoprotein receptor family (17) . The ASLV Env hydrophobic internal fusion loop is sequestered in the prefusion, metastable state, but on receptor binding at neutral pH and at a temperature \u03fe22\u00b0C, conformational changes are triggered to expose and insert the fusion loop into the cell plasma membrane (18 -20) . This triggering of the fusion subunit by receptor binding is pH-independent and is analogous to the effects of conformational changes on HIV-1 gp160 on CD4 and chemokine receptor binding. However, previous studies show that in the presence of bafilomycin, an agent that raises the pH of endosomes, viral reverse transcripts were not detected in infected cells. This finding thus suggests a key role for low pH in entry (12) . Additional studies on ASLV support the role of low pH being required to induce hemifusion and stabilization of the 6-helix bundle (21, 22) .

Considering the nature of the ASLV 2-step entry mechanism, our results are in alignment with the biology of the virus. Initially, receptor binding of ASLV SU triggers conformational changes at the cell surface, where the ASLV TM structure is rearranged to form the extended prehairpin intermediate at neutral pH. Then, low pH conditions trigger additional conformational changes to form the hemifusion intermediate and postfusion 6-helix bundle conformation.

In contrast, fusion proteins of viruses that traffic to the endosome, such as influenza A, EBOV, and MARV, are most stable only at low pH (48 -50) . Previous studies of EBOV GP 2 revealed a dramatic decrease in melting temperature (\u232cT m \u03ed37\u00b0C) on a pH change from 5.3 to 6.1 (48) . For viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane, such as the \u2424-, \u2426-, and \u2425-retroviruses, we have shown that the fusion subunits are most stable at neutral pH (Fig. 2B) . Thermal denaturation analysis of HTLV-1 TM revealed that at values of pH \u03fd 7.0, the T m decreased by \u03fe40\u00b0C relative to that at neutral pH, suggesting a dramatic destabilization of the fusion protein (Fig. 2B) . At values of pH \u03fe 7.0, HTLV-1 gp21 was very stable and did not fully denature even at 99\u00b0C. In addition, the thermal melts above pH 7.0 had a biphasic nature, which was not seen in ASLV TM. The first transition (T m1 ) likely corresponds to the denaturation of the HR2 helix and the second and larger transition (T m2 ) to denaturation of the HR1 trimeric core. At values of pH \u03fd 7.0, a cooperative single transition was observed, suggesting that the HR2 region is not as tightly associated to the HR1 core. One explanation for the neutral-pH-dependent stability of HTLV-1 gp21 is electrostatic interactions. Previous structural analysis of retroviral fusion subunits revealed that HTLV-1 gp21 contains an extensive series of inter-and intrachain salt bridges between HR1 and HR2 regions (25, 51) . The relative contribu-tion of electrostatic interactions to protein stability predominates at neutral pH as both side chains are fully ionized (reviewed in ref. 52 ). However, as the virus is taken up into the low-pH endosomes, the strength of the ion pair is thus reduced. Moreover, HTLV-1 gp21 has 3 histidine residues (His348, His365, and His409) positioned in a hydrophobic cavity at the HR1-HR2 interface. At endosomal pH, these histidine residues are protonated and the placement of an unpaired positive charge in a hydrophobic pocket may explain why HTLV-1 gp21 is unstable at low pH. Taken together, our results are in excellent agreement with a neutral pH environment being required to mediate the host cell fusion, as low pH entry pathways are not a viable route for HTLV-1 entry.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 242, "text": "(48 -50)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 371, "end": 375, "text": "(48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1548, "text": "(25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1552, "text": "51)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1718, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 533, "end": 542, "text": "(Fig. 2B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 744, "end": 753, "text": "(Fig. 2B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "ASLV TM is stable over a wide pH spectrum, unlike other retroviral TMs"}, {"text": "The ASLV fusion protein contains 3 sets of salt bridges (Fig. 3A) : between the HR1 and HR2 helices, between neighboring HR1-HR1 interfaces at the trimeric core, and in the CR region.

An alanine mutation to Arg473 resulted in a 10\u00b0C decrease in the apparent T m compared to wild-type protein, suggesting Arg473 plays a strong role in ASLV TM stability. However, an alanine mutation to Asp468, the ion-pair partner to Arg473, stabilized the fusion protein with a 5\u00b0C increase in melting temperature (Fig. 3B) . We believe that the increase in the melting temperature is due to the formation of a new salt bridge to Asp507 located on the outer HR2 helix. This new ion pair will stabilize the inner core (HR1) to the outer layer (HR2) of the 6-helix bundle, thus leading to the observed increased T m . An alanine mutation to Asp507, as expected, did not affect the T m , indicating that this residue is not involved in stabilizing the fusion protein. We decided to make a double mutation encompassing both Asp468Ala and Asp507Ala. The removal of all the negatively charged partners to Arg473 should decrease the stability of the fusion subunit.

Currently, representative models exist in the PDB of viral fusion proteins from viruses that undergo either a pH-dependent or pH-independent entry mechanism. ASLV, LCMV, and IAV are well-characterized viruses that require low pH for activation, whereas retroviruses are prototypical viruses for pH-independent entry (12, 50, (62) (63) (64) (65) (66) . Assessment of these structures revealed that the helix dipole moments of the viral fusion subunits from three different viral families (ASLV, LCMV, and IAV) appear to have a three-to four-fold larger dipole moment compared to other retroviral (HTLV-1, BLV, MoMLV, and HERV-FRD) and filoviral (EBOV and MARV) fusion proteins ( Table 2) . From our analysis, a trend exists where viruses undergoing a pH-dependent activation (ASLV, LCMV, and IAV) have a stronger helix dipole moment than those that enter through a pHindependent mechanism (MoMLV, HERV-FRD, HTLV-1, and BLV). The filovirus (EBOV and MARV) GP 2 structures are an exception to this helix dipole trend. However, Ebola virus is a rather unique pH-dependent virus. Whereas other pH-dependent viruses utilize the low-pH environment of the endosome to activate its viral glycoprotein for fusion, the low-pH requirement for EBOV entry is linked to the activation of a cellular protease to cleave EBOV GP for fusion (67) (68) (69) . Moreover, the EBOV and MARV GP 2 structures are highly similar to the retroviral fusion subunits (Fig. 1D) . Therefore, while EBOV GP 2 is classified as a pH-dependent virus, its viral fusion protein may have characteristics, including its helix dipole properties, more similar to the pH-independent viruses.

Cartoon shows the viral fusion subunit in the postfusion conformation. Viruses that require low pH for entry, such as ASLV, IAV, and LCMV, fuse at the endosomal membrane and have strong positive and negative charges at their ends due to its helix dipole moment. Negatively charged helix dipole is stabilized by two layers of positively charged histidine or arginine capping residues (only histidine is shown). In addition, the outer layer of histidine residues may be involved in triggering conformational changes in the prefusion viral glycoprotein on entering a low-pH environment. HR1-HR2 interface is in general mediated by largely hydrophobic interactions. Viruses that undergo a pH-independent entry process, such as retroviruses, fuse at the plasma membrane. The helix dipole moment is decreased, and no histidine or arginine residues are located in the CR region to stabilize the negative helix dipole. Moreover, the HR1-HR2 interface is stabilized with a larger number of electrostatic interactions rather than hydrophobic forces. as the electrostatic interactions will provide the utmost stability at neutral pH. Biophysical and mutagenic studies revealed that the HR1-HR2 interface and CR regions of these retroviral TMs are strongly stabilized by its electrostatic interactions (unpublished results). Moreover, previous reports showed that the alanine mutations to these residues resulted in melting temperature changes of \u03fe30\u00b0C and rendered the virus incapable of entry (34) . For instance, Maerz et al.

Despite ASLV being a retrovirus, its fusion protein has evolved to downplay the requirement of these electrostatic interactions on the stability of the postfusion 6-helix bundle. The ASLV HR1-HR2 interface is instead stabilized through hydrophobic interactions, in line with viruses that undergo a low pH-dependent entry.

Given that the pH-independent viral fusion subunits have a smaller negative helix dipole moment, end capping of the helix dipole moment may not be necessary for this class of fusion proteins. In summary, a basic residue is likely required on an inner layer of the HR1 core to counterbalance the negative helix dipole moment and stabilize the postfusion 6-helix bundle for viral fusion proteins that encounter a low pH environment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 477, "end": 481, "text": "(57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 482, "end": 485, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 486, "end": 489, "text": "60)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 744, "end": 752, "text": "(Fig. 5B", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Inner layer of positive charge is important in stabilizing the negative dipole moment"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Viral membrane fusion", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Harrison", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Nat.
