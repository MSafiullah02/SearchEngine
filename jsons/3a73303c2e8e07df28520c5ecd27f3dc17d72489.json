Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions;",

The epidemiology highlights the challenges for containment, mitigation, and control in low-resourced settings and suggests that the most vulnerable groups, particularly those living in informal habitats and depending on informal livelihoods in the Global South, demand attention. As detailed elsewhere [1] , transmission of the virus is by direct contact and droplet spread with cough and sneeze. The most infectious period appears to be when a person is symptomatic, but data point to transmission that can occur before onset of symptoms [2] . A study has shown that the virus is detectable for some time on surfaces, aerosols, and stool [3] , but the focus on reducing transmission has been promoting physical distancing between people, vigorous hand washing with clean water and soap, not touching one's face after touching potentially contaminated surfaces and before hand washing, self-isolation for those with symptoms, and self-quarantine for 14 days after an exposure. On the economic front, recommendations such as working from home have become the default function for workers all over the world. Following these guidelines has been a challenge in the Global North. As the pandemic expands to the Global South, the challenges are greater. The purpose here is to provide a focus on a highly vulnerable population-residents of urban and peri-urban informal settlements. There are conditions to recognize and roles to play among the various actors working in this space, namely, country and local governments, bilateral and multi-lateral agencies, foundations, community-based organizations (CBOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).",

Second, we begin with an emphasis on information transparency and including communities of slum dwellers directly in decision-making, especially those that may already be vulnerable to infection, such as older people, persons with disabilities, and other regularly excluded subgroups. Third, preventing the spread of coronavirus should not come at the expense of slum dwellers' existing needs, from housing to water and sanitation to primary health care to employment and political recognition. Fourth, all slums we know about and work with have assets, even among the widespread deprivation, that can be utilized to share information, prevent exposure, and support over-all well-being. Fifth, investing in the health and well-being of the urban poor and residents of slums first will ultimately prevent disease reservoirs that would eventually spillover into the general population. So, we call on governments to prioritize the humanity, dignity, and assets of residents of urban slums and their communities; to engage with residents, migrants, and the urban poor more generally to find ways to improve their well-being; and to co-create solutions between residents of urban informal settlements and medical, public health, and other experts.",

Schools, service providers, and faith-based organizations in urban informal settlements, as well as traditional leaders, CBOs, and NGOs are also crucial institutions that must be engaged and supported during a coordinated COVID-19 response.

These committees must be networked across a settlement (since large slums have hundreds of thousands of residents and smaller villages or districts within them), across entire metropolitan regions and across all cities in a country. Governments should avoid top-down directives forced upon residents of informal settlements. A key lesson from the Ebola outbreak in the slums of Monrovia, Liberia, was that mistrust between the poor and medical and public health professionals contributed to misinformation and treatment delays; less appreciated was that slum residents had innovative ideas about how to improve hygiene and well-being [22] . Those already living on the streets and in slums likely have a legitimate mistrust and fear of government and outsiders claiming to help, since these institutions can be perceived as oppressive and interested in stymying political opposition [23, 24] . There are existing models of intra-slum settlement, inter-city, and global networks of mobilized slum dwellers that can coordinate COVID-19 response teams, such as those developed by Shack Dwellers International (SDI) [25] . Of course, there can be many NGOs working in urban slums, the homeless urban poor may not be easily reached or organized, and not all NGOs may prioritize the interests of or directly support the local people. There are likely some pre-existing organized community groups, as well as NGOs skilled in disaster prevention and response [26] , public health, preventing genderbased and ethnic violence, and with mobilizing hard-to-reach populations such as youth gang members [27] , and all these should be identified early in this process [28] [29] [30] . The experts from SDI and similar organizers of the urban poor can help ensure the diverse cultures, religions, and ethnicities that often exist side by side in urban slums, as well as any conflicts that may be present, are acknowledged as place-specific plans for disease prevention, potential isolation, and physical distancing. Community-led committees must also be empowered to lead on the public health and disease messaging, including avoiding xenophobic and racist falsities [31] , and help decide the appropriate use of technologies in communication to those who may be illiterate or have minimal health or science education [32, 33] .

These payments must compensate for the impacts of any proposed COVID-19 prevention measures, such as social distancing, that will eliminate day labor, employment as domestic servants in higher-income neighborhoods, and the street economies of urban slums. The payment amounts should be negotiated at the local scale, but we suggest a minimum of 3-month living wage salary to the poor, which can cover food, rent, utilities, and other basic needs [45] . Countries can find the resources for these payments when the IMF, World Bank, and bilateral lending institutions immediately end debt interest (and even principal) payments for all low-income countries and those with sizeable slum populations, as was recently called for at the G-20 summit by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and endorsed by the UN Economic Commission for Africa [46, 47] . Private charities and philanthropy, as well as individual donors, should pool resources into a COVID-19 Emergency Financing Programme for these same countries [45] . The slum dweller payments should be given to all the urban poor, whether or not they can \"prove\" they are homeless or live in an informal settlement [45] . The payments should, where possible, use established electronic cash transfer means and programs, like Jan Dhan, Aadhaar card, and MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) in India, m-Pesa in Kenya, Prospera in Mexico, and Colombia's Familias en Acci\u00f3n and Bolsa Familia in Brazil [48] .

            "text": "Many urban informal settlement residents rely on informal health providers as their first entry into the health care system, either due to cost, trust, or access issues [50] . This may be especially true for such common ailments as fevers and coughs, two early indicators of potential infection with novel coronavirus. Informal providers and community health workers may have the trust with local residents to also be able to identify those slum dwellers at higher risk for COVID-19, such as those with HIV, TB, and COPD [51] . We suggest incorporating, not ignoring, the informal providers into all pandemic response plans in the urban slums [52] . Such providers could be key to early detection of cases, and they along with community health workers (CHWs) from each urban slum should be trained to both protect themselves and others, such as by helping detect symptoms and reporting to relevant authorities [53, 54] . CHWs could ensure that all adults age 55 or older and/or with chronic medical conditions received verbal daily screening for symptoms of fever, cough, and respiratory distress, while ensuring continuity of care for their pre-existing conditions. Testing, screening, and contact tracing for COVID-19 infections should be prioritized and done by employing an \"army\" [58, 59] . We prefer reaching standards for non-emergency situations, but know that in the short term, very few slums will be able to meet the WHO recommendations of 50 l per person per day of potable water. Sharing of water access points forces residents to spend hours seeking and queuing for water, both of which adversely impact health and economic status [ 60, 61] . Lack of these basic services can contribute to increased violence and further spread of disease [62] . We recognize there is no one-size-fits-all for delivering these essential services [ 63] , but governments should explore immediately delivering water trucks, sanitizing stations, and portable toilets. Communities should be consulted, along with local officials, and municipal and national policies should be prepared to develop plans that provide clean water and safe, hygienic, and dignified toilets on a large scale, such as that of India's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) or Clean India Mission [64] . (6) Immediate food assistance. Malnutrition and food insecurity is endemic in many urban slums throughout the world [65] [66] [67] [68] . Urban slum dwellers rely on day wages to purchase food, and street food vending is often a significant source of calories and nutrition [69, 70] . Schools often provide essential nutrition and meals for children living in slums, and closing those institutions may deny children access to their only consistent meals [71] . Providing produce and proteins for home cooking may also not be adequate, especially if residents of informal settlements are forced to cook inside their structures. Indoor air pollution from cooking [72, 73] can contribute to respiratory infections, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in urban slums [74] . WHO estimates 7 million people die every year from ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution, with nearly 90% of deaths occurring in lowand middle-income countries [75] . During any shelter-in-place strategies during the pandemic, safe alternatives to air-polluting indoor cooking must be made available [76] . Governments should support existing CBOs, faith-based groups, and others that may already be providing food support to the poor and ensure they can deliver cooked meals to all those in the informal settlements and living on the streets. Efforts should be made to ensure adequate nutritional content, including protein, of all delivered food. (7) Solid waste collection strategy. Governments must develop a coordinated solid waste collection strategy for all urban slums. Urban slums largely lack municipal waste collection [77] so residents, youth groups, and/or organized cartels often fill the void [78] . [79] When households are forced to remain in place, additional solid waste will be generated. When refuse is removed, it is often landfilled near other informal settlements, shifting the waste and related disease burdens to another group of urban informal settlements [80] . Solid waste recycling can also be an income-generating activity for some slum dwellers [ 81] . However, intermittent waste collection in urban slums contributes to the regular burning of waste and related unhealthy particulate air pollution and dump sites that act as breeding grounds for other disease vectors (i.e., mosquitos, rats, etc.) that are known to make urban slum dwellers susceptible to dengue, leptospirosis, and other communicable diseases [82, 83] . A key lesson from the Ebola outbreak [84] in 2014 was that quarantines, which were used as a response measure in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, resulted in large waste disposal burdens that put an even greater strain on the health of residents of informal settlements. (8) Immediate plan for mobility and health care. An emergency risk plan that ensures access into and out of the urban slum settlement for emergency vehicles (ambulance, firefighting, etc.) for elderly and disabled persons must be immediately developed [85] . Narrow lanes, steep slopes, river crossings, and other natural and human-made barriers can deny emergency vehicle access to urban slums.",

Most urban slums lack formal health clinics that can provide needed care to a large number of people, and when clinics do exist, cost, distance, and mistreatment by medics are barriers the poor face when seeking care. As noted above, informal and unregulated health care providers proliferate in slums. Mobile clinics can more easily be outfitted with oxygen tanks, nasal cannulae, and oxygen facemasks, as well as other diagnostic tools necessary for the treatment of COVID-19. The mobile units should also be prepared to treat the most common ailments in urban slums, which tend to be diarrhea, upper respiratory infections, and injuries. Large mobile teams of health professionals, doctors, and nurses, with testing kits and, ideally, ventilators and other equipment, could visit multiple slums in the same day. These units could then be quickly deployed wherever the number of reports seems to be growing the fastest. The units will need clinicians skilled in intubation and ventilator support and other advanced life support services. Governments will also need to engage companies that supply advanced life support equipment to make sure such resources are deployed to hospitals that serve the urban poor, and hospitals, be they government, private, or charity, must open up their intensive care units (ICU) to patients from informal settlements.",

There will be a need to provide necessary training, outreach, and services to the residents of settlements where longstanding trust has been developed. All proposed interventions must uphold human rights laws, since the urban poor frequently experience violations of their rights [86] .
