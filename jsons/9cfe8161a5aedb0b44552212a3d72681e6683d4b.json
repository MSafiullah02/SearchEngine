            "text": "The emergence of a novel strain of betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to a pandemic that has been associated with hundreds of thousands of deaths. Research is ongoing around the world to create vaccines and therapies to minimise rates of disease spread and mortality. Crucial to these efforts are molecular characterisations of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Such antibodies would be valuable for measuring vaccine efficacy, diagnosing exposure, and developing effective biotherapeutics. Here, we describe our new database, CoV-AbDab, which already contains data on over 380 published/patented antibodies and nanobodies known to bind to at least one betacoronavirus. This database is the first consolidation of antibodies known to bind SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We supply relevant metadata such as evidence of cross-neutralisation, antibody/nanobody origin, full variable domain sequence (where available) and germline assignments, epitope region, links to relevant PDB entries, homology models, and source literature. Our preliminary analysis exemplifies a spectrum of potential applications for the database, including identifying characteristic germline usage biases in receptor-binding domain antibodies and contextualising the diagnostic value of the SARS-CoV binding CDRH3s through comparison to over 500 million antibody sequences from SARS-CoV serologically naive individuals. Community submissions are invited to ensure CoV-AbDab is efficiently updated with the growing body of data analysing SARS-CoV-2. CoV-AbDab is freely available and downloadable on our website at http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/coronavirus.",

            "text": "To respond effectively to the recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it is essential to understand the molecular basis for a successful immune response to coronavirus infection (1) . In particular, characterising the B-cell response is important as the identification of potent neutralising antibodies could pave the way for effective treatments, aid in prior exposure diagnosis, or assist in predicting vaccine efficacy (2) (3) (4) (5) . Molecular characterisations of binding/neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens are only just beginning to emerge. However, the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 (the virus responsible for the 2003 epidemic) spike protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) target the same human receptor and share high sequence and structural homology (2) . As a result, collating data on SARS-CoV-1 binders may lead to the identification of potent cross-neutralising antibod-ies, as suggested in some early SARS-CoV-2 studies (6, 7). Solved crystal and cryo-EM structures indicate a relatively discrete set of neutralising RBD epitopes (possibly resulting from substantial glycan coverage (8)), with paratopes tending to span both the heavy and light chain complementaritydetermining regions (6, (9) (10) (11) (12) . Other SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins also display homology to more distantly related betacoronaviruses such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Therefore, knowledge of antibodies that bind to MERS-CoV antigens could be relevant in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and indeed the anti-MERS-CoV combination therapy REGN3048/REGN3051 is already being trialled on SARS-CoV-2 patients in the USA (13) . Given this, a central database facilitating molecularlevel comparisons between published and patented anticoronavirus antibodies would be a valuable tool in the fight against COVID19. This resource would also act as a central hub to consolidate knowledge and coordinate efforts to identify novel antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2. As the number of known binders builds up over time, researchers could harness this repository for many purposes, including deriving crucial sequence/structural patterns that distinguish neutralising from non-neutralising SARS-CoV-2 binders (1), or deducing independent neutralising epitopes exploitable by combination therapies. We have built CoV-AbDab, a new database that aims to document molecular information and metadata on all published or patented anti-coronavirus antibodies.",

The vast majority of the SARS-CoV antibody binders have human genetic origin (88.5% with se-b S1, RBD S1, RBD/non-RBD S1, non-RBD quence information aligned to human germlines), and derive from a mixture of isolated B-cells from infected or convalescent patients, transgenic mice, or recombinant human immune or non-immune phage display libraries. We soon expect the proportion from infected human B cells to increase, as papers characterising and panning the adaptive immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 patients continue to emerge (24) (25) (26) . A relatively small portion of antibodies were detected by challenging mice with SARS antigens, and a few of these were subsequently humanised. All but one SARS-CoV binding nanobody was obtained using phage display. MERS-CoV antibodies followed a similar distribution of origins, but nanobodies were sourced from the B-cells of infected/convalescent camels or immunised llamas (Supplementary Figure 1b) . We also evaluated the distribution of protein targets (and epitope regions, for spike protein binders) for all anti-SARS-CoV1/2 ( Figure 1b) At the time of writing, sequence information has been released for three antibodies (CR3022, S309, and S315) and one nanobody (VHH-72) that have been proven to neutralise SARS-CoV-2. These all target the RBD, and can crossneutralise SARS-CoV-1.",

Here, we analyse IGHV gene usage, as this transcript encodes two of the three heavy chain complementarity determining regions (CDRH1 and CDRH2). Analysis of the CDRH3 region, which lies at the junction of IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ genes, is performed in the next section. Figure 2a shows the distribution of IGHV genes in SARS-CoV binding antibodies against all targets (left-hand-side), and after filtering only for antibodies known to bind the RBD (right-hand-side). In both cases, over half of the antibod- To see whether RBD binding CDRH3s displayed any sequence biases, we used WebLogo plots (73) to visualise residue/position distributions (Figure 3 ). The MERS-CoV RBD binders displayed slightly higher homology at central loop positions, but neither showed a strong signal that implicates a particular interaction type. The SARS-CoV RBD binders have a slight tendency to exploit a poly-tyrosine tail towards the end of the CDRH3, hinting at a role for the IGHJ6 germline that bears this motif. IGHJ6 was independently implicated in a clone convergent in four of six SARS-CoV-2 patients in the study by Nielsen et al. (26) .",

The OAS database is a regularly updated project to catalogue all publicly available immune repertoire sequencing experiments (currently over 60 studies), providing cleaned amino acid sequence datasets binned by individual and other useful metadata. We assume that the vast majority of this sampled population is serologically naive to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, given both the high infection rate and that there is currently no evidence to suggest that exposure to common cold coronaviruses yields SARS-CoV cross-reactive antibodies (79) . It follows that the presence of CDRH3s shown to bind SARS-CoV but that have high sequence identity matches to OAS may be less useful for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 exposure. to be proximal to sequences isolated in the recent Stanford SARS-CoV-2 patient serum investigation (26) . Exact clonal matches (V gene + high CDRH3 identity) were considerably rarer, implying full clonotyping may need to be performed on SARS-CoV-2 repertoires in order to identify genuine responding antibodies. Conversely, some CDRH3s from SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies found in SARS-CoV-1 (mAb S309 (6)) and SARS-CoV-2 (mAb 32D4 (25)) responding repertoires have considerably lower than average closest sequence identity matches to OAS (70% and 67% respectively).",

IGHV3-30 has been found to be unusually abundant in several recent B-cell sequencing investigations (26, 74-76). IGHV1-2 (75, 76) and IGHV1-18 (76) have also been implicated. In marked contrast to the SARS data, anti-MERS-CoV RBD antibodies (Figure 2b) are disproportionately (37.2%) sourced from the IGHV1-69 locus. These antibodies derive from eight independent investigations -Wang et al. (47), Niu et al. (48), Chen et al. (51), Ying et al. (60), Jiang et al. (61), Tang et al.

We then analysed the CDRH3 regions of anti-SARS-CoV and anti-MERS-CoV antibodies. Overall, we traced 54 distinct SARS-CoV RBD binding antibody CDRH3 sequences and 75 distinct MERS-CoV RBD binding antibody CDRH3 sequences. The non-redundant CDRH3 length distributions are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. SARS-CoV RBD binders are spread between CDRH3 lengths 8 and 20 (median: 16, mean: 14.87 \u00b1 3.56), while the CDRH3s of MERS-CoV RBD binders lie between lengths 5 and 26 (median: 18, mean: 16.17 \u00b1 4.14). The longer average lengths for MERS-CoV binders are consistent with the observed IGHV gene distribution, as broadly neutralising IGHV1-69 antibodies tend to have longer CDRH3s (21).",
