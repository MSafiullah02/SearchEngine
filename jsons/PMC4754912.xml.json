Se supplementation in farmed animal feed may counteract problems caused by deficiency of this mineral but also ameliorate the physiological response to infection, inflammatory disorders and stress [5]. However, Se supplementation is still controversial, because 1) Se has a narrow range between nutritive requirements and toxicity, 2) nutritional requirements may vary considerably across species and 3) physiological conditions within an organism, as well as environmental factors, can influence the dietary needs for this mineral.",

In accordance with these studies, the European Union has legislated that if additional Se is added to feed, the total level must not exceed 0.5 mg Kg\u22121 (dry mass) (Commission Regulation EU No 432/2012). However these studies need to be updated as they are primarly based on feeding trials using inorganic Se (mainly sodium selenite, Na2SeO3) as supplement. Recent evidence suggests that organic Se is more bioavailable and tolerated at higher concentrations than inorganic Se [9], where selenomethionine (SeMet) is currently the most preferred alternative for supplementation.",

It is important that the diet formulations meet the mineral nutritional requirements of fish as this is crucial to ensure optimal growth and production efficiency in fish farming. In line with this reasoning, a recent study carried out in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) showed that fish may benefit from organic Se supplementation up to 5 mg Kg\u22121 (dry mass) in the diet during larval development, due to enhanced antioxidant protection during muscle development [10]. Other investigations in trout have shown that farmed fish may require a higher content of Se in their diet, especially when subjected to stress caused by crowded conditions. In trout, it has been reported that the Se requirement can increase up to 4 mg Kg\u22121 (dry mass) when the fish is subjected to stress and a high tolerance can be ensured if it is delivered in an organic form [11, 12].",

            "text": "Se plays an important role within the immune system [5, 13]. Selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) and thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs) are responsible for the regulation of cellular redox status during an immune response [14]. Tight control of radical oxygen species (ROS) produced during an immune challenge is crucial to guarantee effective responses to pathogens. ROS are generated in the early stage of immune activation and they function as mediators of intracellular signalling, as well as paracrine messengers for immune cell recruitment [15]. ROS also have a microbial killing function in phagocytic leukocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils, i.e. via the oxidative burst [16]. However, oxygen radicals at high levels are cytotoxic bioproducts capable of damaging lipids, proteins and nucleic acids [17]. Se incorporated within selenoproteins exerts its antioxidant activity by maintaining the balance between the positive and negative effects of ROS [14]. Other selenoproteins, strictly related to inflammation and immunity, include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane proteins selenoprotein K (SelK) and S (SelS), which are both involved in protection of cells towards ER stress. SelS appears to be involved in retrograde translocation of misfolded proteins from the ER [18], whereas SelK is required for Ca2+ flux during the activation of different immune cell types (such as T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) [19].",

In this context, Se-enriched feed additives have become an attractive resource for formulation of functional feeds for animal farming, including aquaculture. However, the use of Se supplementation to improve farmed fish defences towards infections is still controversial, since it is difficult to determine in different species which level can be beneficial before detrimental effects due to Se toxicity occur. From our previous study in rainbow trout [20] it was clear that Se supplemented as Se-yeast (Sel-Plex) is well absorbed up to 8 mg Se Kg\u22121 (dry mass) without causing any evident sign of toxicity. In addition the metabolic response of trout to Sel-Plex shows a clear change in the profile of selenocompound accumulation with increasing concentration of Sel-Plex inclusion: at concentrations \u2265 4 mg Se Kg\u22121 there was evident accumulation of selenocysteine (SeCys) over SeMet, which may account for the higher selenoprotein synthesis (Lawan, pers observation). However, when the transcriptomic response of several selenoproteins was analysed, a higher induction of their mRNA expression was seen primarly when 0.5 and 4 mg Kg\u22121 of Se was added to the diet. For continuity of these investigations, in this study we tested the effects of Sel-Plex supplementation during an immune challenge induced by poly(I:C), a double stranded RNA that mimics a viral infection. The whole trout transcriptomic response was investigated by microarray analysis and gene ontology (GO) analysis, the latter carried out to highlight the biological processes that were most influenced by Sel-Plex supplementation in the head kidney (HK) and liver, the principal immune and metabolic organs in fish, respectively.",

For the feeding trial, 216 fish were distributed in nine tanks; three tanks were assigned to each diet, giving 72 fish per diet group. After an acclimatization period of four weeks, a ten week feeding trial was carried out. Three diets were used: the acclimatization diet as control and two diets enriched with Sel-Plex to give an additional 1 or 4 mg Se Kg\u22121. All the diets were prepared by the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research, Greece (HCMR, www.hcmr.gr) and the composition is given in Table 1 and Additional file 3: Table S1 . All the components were kept constant with the exception of the wheat meal and wheat gluten that were reduced in proportion to the Sel-Plex addition (ie to ensure the oil and protein content were the same between diets). Briefly, the vitamins and Sel-Plex were stirred in a small mixer (Kenwood KM260), whilst the remaining raw materials (excluding the fish oil) were placed in a large mixer (Hobart A200 DT). After mixing for 15 min, the two components were combined together in the large mixer for an additional 15 min before adding the fish oil, and mixing for a further 15 min.

A trout transcript for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) decoy receptor (corresponding to human tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 6b, decoy, TNFRSF6B) was also up-regulated upon Sel-Plex supplementation; this protein belongs to the TNF receptor superfamily and acts as a decoy receptor that neutralizes FAS ligand action, protecting cells from apoptosis. A lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF factor mRNA (LITAF) and a transcript for microsialin (CD68) were also highly induced in the supplemented group. LITAF is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by monocytes and tissue macrophages that plays a role in phagocytic activities of tissue macrophages (both in intracellular lysosomal metabolism and extracellular cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions), whereas CD68 is a potent stimulator of macrophages that induces secretion of TNF-alpha and other inflammatory mediators, possibly leading to p53-induced apoptosis. Also the induction of transcripts for signal transduction mediators, such as caspase 3 (CASP3) and IFN regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) were enhanced to some degree in the group fed Sel-Plex enriched diet. IRF2 is known to compete with IRF1 to inhibit the expression of type I IFNs. However transcripts for trout type I IFN were equally induced by poly(I:C) in the two diet groups fed the control and the Sel-Plex enriched diet, as shown by both qPCR and microarray platforms. A transcript matching to the human receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2) was also more highly induced upon Sel-Plex supplementation; this protein is a positive regulator of NF-\u03baB and its expression might be correlated with the reduced expression of NF-\u03baB inhibitor alpha (matching to human nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha, NFKBIA) in the same experimental group.",

Also transcripts for fish orthologues of human Paf1/RNA polymerase II complex component (CTR9), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) and zinc finger FYVE domain containing 9 (ZFYVE9) were more highly induced in the group fed the Sel-Plex enriched diet. CTR9 is a component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C) which has multiple functions during transcription by RNA polymerase II and it is implicated in the regulation of development and maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency. PTPRF possesses an intrinsic protein tyrosine phosphatase activity that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitosis, and oncogenic transformation. ZFYVE9 is a double zinc finger motif-containing protein that participates in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) signalling pathway. A sequence corresponding to the mRNA for human Runt-Related Transcription Factor 1 (RUNX1) was also up-regulated. This protein is a heterodimeric transcription factor that binds to the core element of many enhancers and promoters and is thought to be involved mainly in the development of normal hematopoiesis. Another transcript differentially expressed was the trout aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) which plays an important role in xenobiotic responses, and after binding to a ligand it translocates into the nucleolus where it induces the expression of factors involved in xenobiotic metabolism. It can also form a heterodimer with HIF1A and contributes to the response to hypoxia. Finally, chemokine (C-X-C Motif) ligand 11 (CXCL11) expression was doubled in the group fed the Sel-Plex enriched diet. This chemokine is induced by IFN-\u03b3, is the dominant ligand of the CXCR3 receptor (see above) and has an important function to trigger the chemotactic response of T-cells.",

SelP is another important component of this protein family; it is well known as the main selenoprotein responsible for organism Se homeostasis and transport, however a role in the immune response, especially in inflammation, has also been proposed for this protein [35, 36]. The role of Se within the immune system has been investigated extensively [13] . It is well established that a low Se status can compromise responses to stress and immune challenges within an organism [37\u201339] . Se supplementation might either counteract compromised physiological status due to Se deficiency, or ameliorate the basal immune function and represent a way to help recovery from certain pathological conditions [40\u201342] .

The mode of action of many fish viruses during infection is still under investigation, and there is a continuous effort to find possible solutions to enhance fish natural defences. Functional feeds might represent an alternative to improve fish natural defences. They are particular diet compositions, containing substitutes or supplements with the aim to improve fish fitness and immune defences. Elements such as Se, provided at supranutitional levels and below toxic concentrations, might represent a natural and sustainable solution to improve fish health. In our previous study [20] we proposed that fish, salmonids in particular, may require higher levels of Se compared to mammals and more than current legislation allows (0.5 mg Kg\u22121 dry mass). We showed that Se delivered as Sel-Plex to reach supplementation levels between ~5\u20139 mg Se Kg\u22121, is well absorbed and might improve selenoprotein synthesis. These findings are in line with other studies that found that salmonids might benefit from Se at this range of concentrations, especially if delivered in organic form and when fish are under stressful conditions.",

To this end, we carried out a transcriptomic analysis by microarray on both liver and HK from rainbow trout challenged with this viral mimic after being fed a diet enriched with Sel-Plex. After a first qPCR screening a slight but significant induction of selenoprotein transcripts was seen in the liver of the group supplemented with 4 mg Se Kg\u22121. Interestingly in the same experimental group a significant increase of type-II IFN (especially IFN-\u03b32) was also detected, with downstream molecules such as CXCL11 and viperin following the same trend. However, with increasing concentration of Sel-Plex, there was also a small decrease in type-I IFN (mainly IFN-b) and selected cellular receptors involved in viral sensing, such as TLR9, LGP2 and MDA5 (the latter significantly). The preliminary qPCR results led to the selection of the group fed 4 mg Kg\u22121 Sel-Plex for the microarray analysis together with the control group. The entire trout array was re-annotated to the human genome, therefore for each fish gene the human orthologue was found by BLAST analysis in the Ensemble database. Human and fish have quite different genome structures, mainly due to the whole genome duplications that have occurred in the teleost lineage. Several genes present as a single copy in humans can be present in fish as two or more (especially in the case of salmonids) isoforms. Some of these multiple copies are pseudogenes but in other cases these multiple isoforms can exert different biological functions, increasing the complexity of various pathways. Hence, in taking this approach there was a risk that only partial information would be retrieved from the transcriptomic analysis, but as the human genome remains the most annotated, it gave the possibility to carry out a more extensive analysis. It also allowed use of more bioinformatic tools, giving the possibility of a more flexible analytical approach. For example, for the GO analysis, ClueGO allowed the up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts to be analysed together and to determine the contribution of the two clusters in the biological pathways found altered in each of the contrasts considered for this study.",

Overall the response of this organ to the diet was relatively mild. Only a small set of transcripts (20 targets) was processed by the GO analysis, and the main terms were involved in lipid and steroid metabolism. The possible effects of Se supplementation on fish metabolism of lipids, especially steroid and fatty acids, might be an intriguing aspect to investigate further. Should Se be able to increase the fillet nutritional value, for example by improving the content of omega-3 fatty acids, it could have an important impact on human nutrition and fish food marketing. Lipid metabolism can also influence the fish immune response. Recent findings have shown that cholesterol, specifically oxidized derivates such as 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), are important mediators during the innate response to pathogens. During virus infection, TLR-mediated signalling in macrophages triggers the induction of an IFN response, which promotes the production of 25HC mediated by STAT1; in turn this oxysterol can act on multiple levels as a potent paracrine inhibitor of viral infection for a broad range of viruses [43]. The present results suggest that Sel-Plex supplementation is able to modulate liver lipid metabolism and increase cholesterol production, possibly enhancing the innate immune response against viral infections. The results also revealed a considerable induction of LDLR in the HK, which might be associated with the pathway just described.",

Also a metabolic crosstalk between heart and liver has been described, that plays a pivotal role in the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy when a dysregulation of liver lipid metabolism occurs [48]. However, it is difficult to make inferences from such a small set of genes, as to whether there is a real and strong correlation between Se supplementation, lipid metabolism and muscle tissue homeostasis, especially when the process under examination has not been completely explored in a more established animal model and is still totally unknown in fish.

Downstream of the IFN-\u03b3 pathway, the mRNAs for CXCL11 and its receptor CXCR3 were positively modulated by the experimental diet. All the transcripts found positively regulated by the poly(I:C) challenge in the group fed Sel-Plex clustered into three main GO processes: NF-\u03baB regulation, IL-12 production and the IFN-\u03b3 response. These three processes are tightly connected. IFN-\u03b3 production is controlled by cytokines secreted from antigen presenting cells (APCs), most notably IL-12 and IL-18; these cytokines serve as a bridge to link infection with IFN-\u03b3 production in the innate immune response. Macrophage recognition of many pathogens induces secretion of IL-12 and chemokines, which in turn attract natural killer (NK) cells to the site of inflammation, and IL-12 promotes IFN-\u03b3 synthesis in these cells. In macrophages, NK and T-cells, the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 stimulation further increases IFN-\u03b3 production, and favours Th1 cell differentiation [50]. NF-\u03baB, as a key transcription factor for a wide variety of genes that control immune responses, is likely playing a central role in cytokine expression and in the propagation of the response during viral challenge [51\u201353].",

Consequently the T helper Th1/Th2 balance skews towards a Th1 response, leading to enhanced differentiation/activation of CD4+ T-cells and production of IFN-\u03b3 [54]. In the same study, it was shown that free thiols, mainly thioredoxin (Trx), are the intracellular mediators responsible for the increased production of IL-2; TrxR, being responsible for the regeneration of the oxidised Trx, becomes a central component in controlling the process. Interestingly, from our preliminary qPCR screening an induction of IFN-\u03b3 and downstream mediators was seen, but at much higher concentrations (4 mg Kg\u22121) than those considered for supplementation in mammalian models (0.5\u20131 mg Kg\u22121).",

Whilst the expression of some of the components of the cell pathogen recognition machinery was reduced, a positive regulation of many immune effectors in the Sel-Plex supplemented group was found when the antiviral defences were stimulated. This suggests other cell recognition components are involved in the mediation of the cellular response to poly(I:C).",

            "text": "Sel-Plex supplementation had a major impact on the trout HK. Even at the relatively high enrichment level of 4 mg Se Kg\u22121 (dry mass), the additive improved the expression of several genes involved in pathways connected with hematopoiesis and immune system development. In contrast, less of a transcriptomic response was seen in the liver, and the main process modulated by Sel-Plex was related to lipid metabolism. Lipids, especially sterol lipids (e.g. cholesterol and glucocorticoids) and fatty acids (e.g. omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids), have a major involvement in the immune response and the final quality of the fish fillet, and therefore it is worth investigating further the possible impact of Se supplementation on these processes in fish. During viral PAMP stimulation, Sel-Plex supplementation substantially increased the expression of mediators of antiviral defence. IFN-\u03b3 was one of the principal markers for this pathway and interestingly a similar response to Se supplementation has been seen in mammals, albeit at lower inclusion levels of Se than the levels used in this study. These findings, together with past reports in the literature, further support the conclusion that fish might require a higher level of Se than mammals, and an increase over the limit of 0.5 mg Kg\u22121 imposed by current EC legislation should be considered for supplementation in aquaculture. Sel-Plex, being a highly bioavailable supplement of organic Se, might represent the most suitable option for supplementation of fish feeds, to achieve the final aim of improving fish fitness and resistance against immune challenges.",
