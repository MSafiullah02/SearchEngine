A very large number of metabolic disorders have been described in man, which can be congenital (inborn errors of metabolism) or acquired. In contrast, very few metabolic disorders have been described in the horse and particularly the foal. In this issue of Equine Veterinary Education, Unt et al. (2012) describe in detail a case of the metabolic disorder intestinal hyperammonaemia in a 7-week-old foal. This case was previously described (as Case 28) in a series of 36 cases of hyperammonaemia, which included 7 foals that were aged <2 months and three 4-9-month-old foals (Dunkel et al. 2011) .",

These foals may have had an analogous condition to the inherited condition described in man, hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome. In man, HHH syndrome is associated with a defect in the transport of ornithine across the inner mitochondrial membrane, preventing the production of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine by the action of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase in the urea cycle. Carbamoyl phosphate is produced from ammonium, bicarbonate and ATP, and the failure of ornithine to cross the mitochondrial membrane results in the build-up of ammonium (Testai and Gorelick 2010) .",

Treatment during acute episodes is symptomatic including analgesics, sedatives or anxiolytics and fluid therapy (Valentine 2003) .

A transient diabetes mellitus was reported in a 3-day-old Thoroughbred foal with diarrhoea associated with a presumed coronavirus infection (Navas de Solis and Foreman 2010). Although derangements in glucose metabolism and insulin production and sensitivity have been reported as a feature of sepsis in neonatal foals (Hollis et al. 2008; Barsnick et al. 2011) , the requirement for insulin was particularly prolonged in this foal (for 31 days) (Navas de Solis and Foreman 2010) compared to the typical period of 2-4 days in a foal with sepsis (K.T.T. Corley, unpublished observations 2011) . It is therefore possible that this foal had a condition analogous to the transient neonatal diabetes mellitus reported in man (Flanagan et al. 2007 ).",

Clostridial species have been implicated in 2 cases in mature horses (Desrochers et al. 2003; Stickle et al. 2006 ), but in most cases the causative bacteria are not identified. The faecal and therefore presumably intestinal bacterial flora of young foals is different from that of mature horses for the first 4 weeks of life (Kuhl et al. 2011) . Staphylococci and Enterococci, 2 of the bacteria that have been implicated in human ammonium production (Burne and Chen 2000) , are not present in large numbers in the first few days of life (Kuhl et al. 2011) . Therefore the second proposed mechanism of intestinal ammonium production, deamination of glutamine by phosphate-activated glutaminase located in villus enterocytes of the small intestine (Romero-Gomez et al. 2009; Dunkel 2010) , could be responsible for intestinal ammonia production in foals. That said, the case reported by Unt et al. (2012) and 3 additional foals aged <1 month reported by Dunkel et al. (2011) had a primary diagnosis of colitis or enterocolitis, suggesting that the large intestinal flora may have changed considerably. The further 3 young foals reported by Dunkel et al. (2011) had a primary diagnosis of meconium impaction.",
