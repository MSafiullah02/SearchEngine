Together with the 2010 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's call to End the Neglect of laboratories, this has provided a major milestone on a pathway to place diagnostics and laboratory services as important pillars of a healthcare system.3,4 Recent outbreaks of influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Ebola virus disease illustrate the importance of diagnostics in outbreak investigations.5\u20137 With rapid technological innovations in the last 10 years and donor investments in the development of improved diagnostics for infectious diseases of public health importance, it is time to re-examine the Achilles heel and explore the promises and challenges of diagnostics in a digital age.",

Diagnostic testing is traditionally considered as a tool to rule in or rule out a condition or infection when clinical presentation in a patient is non-specific. For diseases such as HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, most infections are asymptomatic but can cause serious long-term consequences. Diagnostics are used to screen for infection so that treatment can be given to prevent the development of long-term complications and to interrupt the chain of transmission to sexual partners or to the fetus in the case of pregnant women. A test for the human papillomavirus helps to determine risk of disease progression to cervical cancer. For pathogens that have developed antibiotic resistance, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, diagnostic testing is used to determine antibiotic susceptibility to ensure treatment efficacy. For HIV patients, a CD4 test result is used to determine if the patient is eligible for antiretroviral treatment and, for those on treatment, a viral load assay is used to determine treatment compliance and drug efficacy. A test of cure is used to determine when treatment can be stopped (Figure 1).\n",

Mass drug administration (MDA) is the main control strategy for many of these diseases, resulting in the need for highly sensitive tests to detect the few remaining cases in areas of low transmission intensity after multiple rounds of MDA. Highly specific tests are then needed to certify elimination and maintain post-elimination surveillance. There is often little commercial interest in the development of diagnostics that are used mainly for surveillance because of the low return on investment.",

The beads are in solution, offering more sites for ligand binding compared to a solid phase support. Fluorescent intensities can yield quantitative results. Protein arrays offer the potential of quantification of the antigen target as a surrogate measure of bacterial, parasite or viral load to inform treatment strategies. Detection of multiple targets from the same pathogen can lead to increased efficiency over single-target assays. Detection of targets from multiple pathogens using a single specimen can offer substantial cost and sample savings over traditional ELISA measurements. The detection platforms are often equipped with data transmission capacities and allows near real-time surveillance of disease trends and monitoring the effect of special interventions.",

These platforms allow multiplexing, but have only been validated for antibody detection in blood samples. Antigen detection from urine or stool samples will require multistep specimen processing and/or purification or concentration before being put into the antigen-antibody reaction within the microfluidic channels. A recent publication showed that it is possible to use the power of smart phones to power a microfluidic immunoassay reaction by plugging the reaction chamber into a smart phone using a dongle.22 Over 80 assays can be run before recharging is necessary. The results are interpreted and displayed on the phone and the data transmitted to a central database if required. A dual test to detect antibodies to HIV and syphilis has been designed on this platform and will have utility not only to improve access to prenatal screening but also to allow surveillance data for the dual elimination of MTCT of HIV and syphilis to be available in real time.23",

These are read with the naked eye, which is subjective and prone to human error and may be further exacerbated by poor lighting in health posts. In addition, RDTs lack on-board quality control and are often used in remote areas where health workers receive minimal training. As a result, accuracy of RDTs performed in the field can be quite variable. This may adversely affect patient care and the accuracy of the data gathered for surveillance.",

Hewlett Packard built a basic data centre at the National AIDS/STD Control Programme (NASCOP) and at testing laboratories for early infant diagnosis. Safaricom, the largest provider of mobile services in Kenya, set up a short code service for SMS. Strathmore University students built the application. PEPFAR, CDC and CHAI rolled out the EID programme countrywide. The result is a National EID portal running on a government data centre\u2014hosting all the testing and program data entered from computers in laboratories equipped with Laboratory Information Systems (web-based applications). Over 2000 health facilities that provide EID services have access to all the data and test results over SMS, mobile web, web and email in near real time. Data analytics include sample transport tracking, volume of testing at each facility, test results, including the number of rejected samples and indeterminate results. Results are delivered via electronic and paper means (SMS printer, email, courier, web) and real time EID/prevention of MTCT programme analytics are available online by facility, and at regional and national levels.",
