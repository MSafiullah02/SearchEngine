These have included, among others; severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Influenza A subtypes, and more recently, Zika virus.3, 4 All of these outbreaks have resulted in significant public health responses internationally, with large resource requirements and implications for frontline healthcare professionals.",

The final sample of 21 health professionals included eight consultants and 13 nurses (four doctors and two nurses with managerial roles) of whom 12 were female and 9 were male. The sample included participants from Emergency Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Management. To ensure confidentiality, further demographic details, including specific participant positions, have been withheld. The data were thematically analysed and systematically coded. Two members of the research team independently coded and cross-checked the data, which were then refined to further develop themes and an overarching interpretation of the data.

The themes emergent from the interviews, and explored in the results above, are interrelated. For example, the vast amount of information, which was constantly changing and sometimes contradictory, developed a dynamic of mistrust among hospital staff which then influenced their engagement with training exercises. This was further reinforced when the logics of training (i.e. PPE procedures) were viewed as incommensurable with the environment within which care was to be provided. In this study, we can see the dynamics of communication influencing the forms of staff engagement with training which then combines with structural/environmental impediments to create the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of variables (thus limiting Ebola preparedness). Understanding the interplay of risk perception, the idiosyncrasies of localised environments, and the influence of these factors on the implementation of \u2018best practice\u2019 at the clinical coalface is critical for successful preparedness planning in the future.",

Similar findings have also been found in Canada, which concluded that a single point of reference within an organisation to facilitate knowledge transfer would assist in overcoming the mistrust of frontline staff related to training and preparedness.18\n",

This study suggests that rigorous control and consistency of information flow from a government, to health service, to local clinician level, with increased resources for staff likely to be involved in direct patient care, and feedback from clinicians as to training effectiveness, would have been effective in increasing the confidence of frontline clinical staff to manage a patient with an infectious threat such as Ebola. The overwhelming nature of preparedness training and the fear and frustration it produces suggests that infection control training including the context of different infections such as Ebola, and including the evidence (and lack of evidence) surrounding policies, would be useful on an ongoing routine basis, rather than in reaction to a current outbreak. It is essential to learn from Ebola rather than moving on without full and careful consideration of how service providers can be better prepared in the future. In addition to the need for accurate scientific knowledge of an infectious threat,15 it is critical to consider the communicative, environmental, cultural \u2018platform\u2019 for outbreak responsiveness, to allow the best possible care for patients and protection of healthcare professionals.",
