Shortly thereafter, PDCoV was identified in South Korea, mainland China, Thailand, Canada, and Laos [6\u20139]. Since PDCoV was detected in mainland China in 2015, the prevalence of PDCoV has continued to increase and has resulted in serious economic losses to the swine industry [10, 11].

Like other coronaviruses, PDCoV also contains four main structural proteins: the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein is postulated to contain epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies, and it has receptor-binding, cell membrane fusion, and virus entry functions [14, 15]. In most coronaviruses, the S protein is cleaved into two separate polypeptides, S1 and S2, by a host cell furin-like protease. S1 is the large receptor-binding domain, while S2 mediates membrane fusion and virus entry [16\u201318]. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) based on the purified S1 portion of the S protein have been successfully developed [19\u201321].",

            "text": "Several reports have described ELISAs for detection of neutralizing antibodies or immunoglobulin (IgG) in serum samples [22\u201324]. However, PDCoV is an enteric pathogen, and the presence of IgA antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity. IgA is an important immunoglobulin for mucosal immunity that can be detected in serum and milk of pigs after virus challenge or inoculation, and therefore serum and milk IgA antibodies to enteric pathogens can act as indicators [25, 26]. Therefore, measuring IgA levels in serum and milk samples is critical for evaluating the level of protection of the mucosal response against PDCoV infection. Here, we have developed an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA antibody ELISA that uses the purified S1 portion of PDCoV S protein as a coating antigen. This assay will serve as a convenient tool for measuring of serum and milk IgA antibody levels in pig herds. Many studies have shown that serum antibodies are passed mainly to piglets through sow\u2019s milk, which results in passive immunoprotection. IgA antibodies have a variety of biological functions, such as inhibiting adhesion and immunological exclusion and neutralization of viruses [27]. Thus, an indirect ELISA for detection of IgA antibodies against PDCoV can be used as a sensitive and specific quantitative method to evaluate immunity to PDCoV.",

Then, the cell monolayers were washed with PBS and inoculated with 100 median tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of PDCoV strain NH for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After removing the inoculum, the cell monolayers were washed three times with PBS and covered with DMEM containing trypsin at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml. At 48 h post-inoculation (hpi), the cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min and then blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were incubated with the serum samples (1:100) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-pig IgA (1:200) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) or anti-pig IgG (1:500) (Sigma) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and counterstained with DAPI (1:1,000) (Sigma) at room temperature for 20 min to visualize nuclear DNA. After washing with PBS, the specific fluorescence was visualized using an EVOS cell imaging system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).",

In our study, IgA-positive milk samples tested negative for IgG, indicating that the concentration of IgG antibodies in milk was relatively low or that the method was not sensitive enough to detect IgG antibodies. Based on what is known about IgA and IgG dynamics during PDCoV infection, we chose to detect IgA rather than IgG, which allows PDCoV infection to be monitored by detecting IgA antibodies in milk samples. PDCoV is an enteric pathogen that replicates primarily on mucosal surfaces. As with other coronaviruses, the presence of serum antibodies against PDCoV is not always correlated with protection. On the contrary, detection of antibodies only shows that individuals have had previous contact with pathogens or have been vaccinated [25\u201327].",

This assay will aid in the future assessment of protection against PDCoV infection. Mucosal immunity plays an important role in immune protection, not only because it has a general pathogen-clearing effect but also because it involves both humoral and cellular immunity [29]. IgA is an important immunoglobulin for mucosal immunity that is secreted by the intestinal mucosa, and it provides resistance against invasive pathogens. High-affinity IgA can directly neutralize toxins and pathogens, while low-affinity IgA can prevent pathogen adhesion. IgA is also an important serum immunoglobulin that mediates a variety of protective functions through interactions with specific receptors and immune mediators [30].",
