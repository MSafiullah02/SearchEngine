As a copious amount of data was collected from the same location, it is possible patients may have been used in more than one study. Findings of these studies has discovered changes in biomarker levels and may potentially be useful in creating a therapeutic intervention. For instance, one study has reviewed the use of anticoagulation therapy in patients with coagulopathy or marked rise in D-dimers in the setting of COVID-19 (38) . Low molecular weight heparin was found to be associated with better prognosis in severe cases. To further asses the role of anti-coagulants as a treatment, we encourage large interventional trails to study this.",
