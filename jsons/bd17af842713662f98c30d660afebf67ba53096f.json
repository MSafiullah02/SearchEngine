A Cochrane review and meta-analysis explored general telemedicine interventions for asthma, finding a potential reduction in hospital admissions, but no impact on quality of life in adults and children, 7 though a separate systematic review for adult patients found significant improvements in asthma control and quality of life compared to usual care. 8 Although initially deployed and studied as a means of delivering health care to remote and rural areas, the wider implementation of high-speed internet connections in schools and decreasing costs of telemedicine equipment have led to deployment in both urban and rural school districts, and commercial telemedicine suites are marketed for use in school settings. 9 Though the literature has provided evidence of some benefit from schoolbased asthma interventions and general telemedicine asthma interventions independently, there has not been a single systematic review that explores school-based telemedicine program to address pediatric asthma.",

Article publication dates ranged from 2001-2018. All studies were longitudinal in design, with follow-up measurement periods ranging from 12 -56 weeks from the start of the study. All studies were conducted in the United States, with 4 urban and 3 rural school settings. Participant age range varied among studies, but all participants were between 3 -18 years old. Two studies included participants with persistent asthma only, while the others did not limit by severity. It should be noted that some studies predated the commonly referenced 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report-3 asthma severity classification guidelines. 21 Outcomes reported included symptom-free days, symptom(s) frequency, quality of life measures, health care utilization, school absences, and spirometry.",

Although four studies reported significant positive results with respect to increased symptom-free days and/or decreased asthma symptom frequency, study quality and methodologic issues limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the available evidence. Over 70% of the studies identified used quasi-experimental designs with high potential for bias and questionable validity of results. With interventions that followed a single group over the course of a school year, the magnitude of temporal and seasonal effects were not quantified, and asthma symptoms and exacerbations are typically most frequent in the fall-season start of the school year. 23 Of the two RCTs, only Halterman 2018 showed a significant increase in symptom-free days and neither showed significant differences in quality of life measures. 17, 18 Generalizability of results from the identified body of literature is also limited. Although the studies were split between rural and urban settings, these schools have vastly different implementation challenges for health programs, with disparate access to asthma training and school nursing resources. 24 Future appraisals of the evidence may need to examine rural and urban districts separately, as was done in a recent clinical management review by Perry et al. 25 Well-funded vs. impoverished school systems, regardless of locale, also have a large effect on the applicability of study results in a wider context. Six of the seven studies utilized school nursing in their interventions, including a nurse practitioner in Arnold 2012, and a school-based health center in Romano 2001. 14, 19 Districts and schools with low school nursing availability may find these interventions infeasible.",

Halterman 2018 submitted telemedicine visits for reimbursement, but policies governing telemedicine reimbursements vary by state.

            "text": "As telemedicine is a method of service delivery rather than an intervention in and of itself, the outcomes observed in these studies are primarily influenced by the design of the intervention being delivered. Quantifying the contribution of telemedicine on the outcome would necessitate a direct comparison to the intervention without the telemedicine component, as was the case with the Halterman 2018 study. This study was a telemedicine-enhanced version of a prior intervention called the School-Based Asthma Therapy trial evaluating the direct provision of asthma control medicines at the school, which showed similar effect sizes for symptom-free days, though it has not yet been reported whether the addition of the telemedicine component decreased the overall staffing needs and costs of this intervention. 17, 28 Prior reviews of school-based asthma educational interventions have shown positive results for intermediate outcomes, such as quality of life and self-efficacy, but inconsistent results regarding health outcomes and school absences. [3] [4] [5] It is plausible that telemedicine could be incorporated to address some of the limitations of prior school-based asthma education programs in effecting health outcomes, such as short intervention duration and limited access to health care to accompany educational programs. 3 In addition, many previously reviewed studies were cluster designs. Future studies aimed at generalizability and feasibility in multiple settings may prefer a larger cluster-based design, while studies aimed at estimating the effect differences between telemedicine interventions may benefit from randomizing at the individual school. 29 Our efforts to review a broad evidence base within the narrow field of school-based telemedicine interventions for asthma necessitated both a liberal definition of telemedicine and a permissive scope of study designs and outcome measures. The variability in interventions delivered and inconsistency in reported outcome measures, as well as the paucity of high-quality studies, limited our ability to perform quantitative analyses and robust assessments of publication bias. The broad definition of telemedicine we employed necessitated the use of several keywords and synonyms for telemedicine (e.g. telehealth, e-health, e-consult, virtual visit, remote visit, remote consult), but we may not have captured all types of technologies that would fall into our definition of telemedicine. In addition, limiting to school-based interventions proved challenging as -school\u2016 often appears in author affiliations. We addressed these challenges with the use of wildcards, MeSH terms, and limiting -school\u2016 keywords to specific fields of each search in order to ensure our searches were relevant but comprehensive (see Supplementary Material) .",

Perhaps most importantly, these studies should include school absences and cost-effectiveness analyses to help schools determine whether to invest limited resources in telemedicine technologies. Initial in-person evaluation and spirometry with specialist to confirm asthma diagnosis, establish severity level, provide asthma action plan, and inhaler technique assessment, followed by re-evaluation through synchronous video, consisting of asthma history and physical, spirometry, and review of symptom diary and healthcare utilization. Patient and school nurse (on-site at school) to remote specialty physician. Not blinded, and allocation concealment methods not described. Patients in intervention group received daily observed therapy in addition to telemedicine visits, vs. control group receiving usual care. Contribution of telemedicine component to outcomes difficult to assess.",

Supplemental Figure 2 compares CHSA QOL measures. Health care utilization Seven studies reported outcomes related to the utilization of health care services: visits to urgent care, visits to the emergency department (ED), hospitalization (inpatient care), preventive medication prescriptions, and appointments with a primary care physician. Studies reported these results with different categorizations of care (e.g., Halterman 2018 combined ED and hospitalization visits together), 17 different recall times (any asthmarelated hospitalization during study versus hospitalization during past two-weeks), and different follow-up times (8 weeks to 56 weeks). Both Bynum 2011 and Arnold 2012 reported no change in average emergency department visits and non-statistically significant decreases in average hospitalizations from baseline to followup (56 weeks and 52 weeks respectively). 14,16 Arnold 2012 reported a decrease in average doctor or clinic visits from 1.23 to 0.38 (n=14, P=0.04). 14 These studies lacked control groups for comparison. In Halterman 2018, the telemedicine group and control group had similar rates of ED visits/hospitalizations at baseline (48.8% vs.",
