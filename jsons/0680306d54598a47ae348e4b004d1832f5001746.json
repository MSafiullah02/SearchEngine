First we use theories of disease spreading on networks to look at the COVID-19 epidemic on the basis of individual contacts -these give rise to predictions which are often rather different from the homogeneous mixing approaches usually used. Our second aim is to look at the role of social deprivation, again using networks as our basis, in the spread of this epidemic. We choose the city of Kolkata as a case study, but assert that the insights so obtained are applicable to a wide variety of urban environments which are densely populated and where social inequalities are rampant. Our predictions of hotspots are found to be in good agreement with those currently being identified empirically as containment zones and provide a useful guide for identifying potential areas of concern. arXiv:2005.00491v1 [physics.soc-ph] 1 May 2020",

Most ongoing statistical physics research has been geared towards getting concrete answers in terms of infected populations, deaths, and preventive measures as quickly and simply as possible. This is, of course, an extremely useful approach to take, given that policy-makers need simple models to craft broad and easily understandable solutions. In our opinion, however, a balance needs to be struck between simplicity and accuracy in the interests of efficiency of outcome. It is for this reason that we focus on an approach that is both more rigorous and more intuitive, which asserts that it is not sufficient to treat this problem within the homogeneous mixing approaches so far used by physicists; we need in fact to focus on the contact networks of individuals, so that we can account for the stark difference in impact of those who have a larger number of contacts and are much more likely to contract the infection and subsequently propagate the disease, than those who live relatively isolated existences.",

The simple idea behind this is that for values of this parameter greater than 1, the disease spreads and will eventually become an epidemic (at a rate proportional to R 0 ), while if the number of people infected by an infected person is * Corresponding author: anita.mehta@ling-phil.ox.ac.uk kept well below 1, the epidemic will die out.",

This is based on an assumption that the population is homogeneous and well mixed, and that everyone is capable of transmitting the infection to everyone else. Such an \"on average\" assumption, however, fails dangerously in the case of epidemics. Newman [3] was the first to take into account that individuals needed to be resolved in terms of their 'degree distribution', i.e. the number of people that they were in contact with, and his pioneering solutions to the disease propagation network have since been widely used [4] [5] [6] [7] for epidemics ranging from HIV to SARS-1.

            "text": "One of the important fallouts of the networks approach is the natural occurrence of hotspots, i.e. of regions of high connectivity, which are particularly vulnerable to the spread of disease. Given the lack of widely available contact network data for such situations, we focus on the conditions of strict lockdown and postulate that the size of an individual's contact network is primarily determined by the size of their household. Regions where household sizes are large are often those which are socially deprived, e.g. when low-income groups live in cramped conditions. These poorer areas provide flashpoints for the propagation of disease even in cities where most of the population live in more privileged conditions. We use available data on the city of Kolkata in India as an example of a city with a high population density which contains many areas of social deprivation, and show how both factors contribute strongly to epidemic propagation. We begin with an analysis of the city as a whole, specialising next to the wards (local areas) that comprise it, so that the heterogeneities of contact networks are probed on smaller scales; we find that this more microscopic analysis has the effect of enhancing outbreaks, and speeding up transitions to epidemics locally. This tendency is even further amplified when we extend our analysis to the population of slum dwellers, where social deprivation adds to cramped living conditions to create even larger contact networks among people who are forced to access basic facilities together. One of the consequences of the above analysis is that we can outline a geographical map of hotspots where quarantining and testing should, in fact, be focused; our predictions are in good agreement with empirical estimates by the government and will, we hope, provide guidelines for future planning in the case of areas not yet identified empirically.",

However, power-law distributions are an idealisation to infinite systems and are, in reality, cut off by exponential tails [3] .

Since the locations of infectious clusters have not yet been published, we look at the number and locations of those regions which have been designated as containment zones. Containment zones are set up by the government to contain the disease within a defined geographical area (usually a city block) following multiple confirmed infections in the area, with a view to breaking the chain of transmission and preventing the spread of the infection to new areas. Each zone is geographically quarantined with enhanced active surveillance [19] . As on April 28, 2020, out of 287 such containment zones in the city of Kolkata, 227 have been identified by ward [19] . Figure 9B shows the number of such zones within each ward. Although most containment zones in Fig. 9B are geographically aligned with the areas we have identified as being at risk (Fig. 9A) , there are a few areas of local outbreaks which our model did not predict in the south-east of the city. This area was urbanized relatively recently and became densely populated in the period after 2011, the date of the last census [9] , which is the source of our data for this part of our research.",

The granularity of the ward-based picture results in strong heterogeneities of contacts, which allow for a faster spreading of the epidemic than if one assumes the more macroscopic picture of contact networks following the same degree distributions across the city. While the city-based picture corresponds to a single Tc = 0.1005 (Fig. 3) , the ward-based picture allows a distribution of Tc from 0.055 to 0.138. a city like Kolkata. When we take a look at individual wards and use available data to construct more realistic contact networks of individuals, we note that areas of high population density are strongly correlated with large household sizes, and so, within our present approximation, with extended contact networks. These are in turn of crucial importance in the spread of disease, as our predictions demonstrate, predictions which in fact are well correlated ( Fig. 9 ) with existing governmental preventive approaches [19] .",

From the point of view of our research, this, even under strict lockdown, forcibly extends their contact networks. In Fig. 12A we show that the household size distribution for slums [11] is only slightly larger overall than that for the overall population computed based on census data [9] . However, the fact that 83% of the slum population in Kolkata share toilet facilities as opposed to 17% who have private toilets, causes a dramatic change in the degree distribution of contacts as shown in Fig. 12B . The orange curve corresponds to the degree distribution for slum dwellers with private toilet facilities, while the blue one corresponds to that where facilities are shared with at least one other family, so that with the percentages mentioned above, the resulting degree distribution is given by the green curve.",

We have looked at slums as a source of high-degree connectivity, which, combined with low economic development (e.g. the anti-correlation with literacy) provide explosive ingredients for a transition to an epidemic. Both of these ingredients have the effect of considerably advancing this transition in the areas where they are prevalent, and hence to the entire population of the city of which they are part. While our data analysis is specific to Kolkata, it is very much more general in its applicability to cities with areas of high connectivity and social deprivation, of which the recent example of Singapore [16, 17] is only one example [20] .",

In [11] , 800 slums in Kolkata were studied via sampling methods, without any information on their exact location. We have therefore had to study the slums collectively, without any information on where exactly, and how extensive, they are in any particular area. The best that we have been able to do is, via census statistics on the percentage of slums per ward [9] , compute the ward-based slum statistics to give a qualitative estimate of the ward-based T c . Obviously, the approximation involved in doing this, i.e. treating the slums per ward as a contiguous unit when they are in fact distributed, is considerable, but in the absence of data, this is an approximation that we are forced to make. Another approximation involves the way in which we compute the revised degree distribution for slums due to shared toilet facilities. In the absence of spatial information on how many families share these facilities, we have taken a conservative approach, assuming that a family of size n shares facilities with only one other family of size n 1 , and using this idea to construct the relevant distributions.",

Another point in this context concerns what we mean by the \"general\" population. The census data [9] that we have based this on includes people of all classes, including slum dwellers, in the city of Kolkata; the specific data on slums [11] is both more recent and focuses only on the 800 slums considered in Kolkata. We reiterate therefore that, as mentioned above, our estimates should be taken as a conservative qualitative indicator of the effects of social deprivation, rather than an accurate quantitative estimate. On a more positive note, our methods can be applied, if the requisite data become available in a rigorous and detailed format, to areas of social deprivation worldwide with a view to estimating their vulnerability to epidemics. Last but not least, while our predictions on hotspots in Fig. 9A are quite well correlated with the empirical data on containment clusters in Fig. 9B , we mention here that our predictions are based on 2011 census data, when some of the areas in the south-east of the city were far less developed and populated than they now are. Had we had access to recent data, this new demography would have been reflected in revised contact network data, and consequent vulnerability to hotspots.",

On the other hand, our network-based theoretical approach is predictive; i.e. we can, on the basis of degree-based data, predict where hotspots could occur, and take a preventive rather than curative approach. Also, and importantly, our approach provides a non-controversial way of suggesting hotspots, without touching on sensitive ethnic or religious characterisations.",

If, for example, people in hotspot areas and their contacts within the same neighbourhood are identified, this would be a way of extending the contact network from beyond the household to a larger range; this would reflect conditions where lockdowns are gradually relaxed so that people can move around within a given radius of where they live.",

Our formalism, with its detailed predictions of levels of risk in the component areas of a large city, would be invaluable in assisting this process by identifying regions that could be, or should not be, opened up.
