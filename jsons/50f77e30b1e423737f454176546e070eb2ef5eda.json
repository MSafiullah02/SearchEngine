            "text": "Enteric caliciviruses are emerging pathogens responsible for diarrhea or gastroenteritis in their respective hosts. In this report, mink enteric caliciviruses (MEC) were detected in feces from diarrheic mink by both immune electron microscopy (IEM) and RT-PCR using a broadly reactive primer pair (p289/290) targeting the highly conserved RNA polymerase regions of the enteric caliciviruses, Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) and Sapporo-like viruses (SLVs). The MEC possess classical caliciviral morphology with typical cup-shaped depressions on the viral surface. Sequence analyses based on nucleotide and predicted amino acid (aa) sequences of the RT-PCR products indicated that MEC is most closely related genetically to SLVs of humans and animals. The MEC shared the highest aa identities (64-71%) in the RNA polymerase region with both human SLVs and the porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC) Cowden strain SLV, indicating that MEC may belong to an individual genogroup or subgroup in the SLV genus. The MEC shared only limited aa identities in the RNA polymerase region with vesiviruses (40-51%) and NLVs (29-33%). The RNA polymerase regions of the cultivable, non-enteric mink caliciviruses (MCV) were also amplified by RT-PCR using the primer pair Pol1/Pol3 based on sequences of vesiviruses, and the primer pair p289/290. Sequence analysis indicated that these MCV shared higher aa identities in the RNA polymerase region with vesiviruses (58-81%) than with SLVs (43-51%) including the MEC, lagoviruses (35-37%) and NLVs (27-35%), suggesting that they are most closely related genetically to vesiviruses. The MEC associated with diarrhea in mink are morphologically similar to but are genetically distinct from the cultivable MCV and likely represent a new member of the SLV genus.",

            "text": "Caliciviruses are small, nonenveloped viruses of 27-38 nm in diameter and possess a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA genome of 7.3-8.3 kb in length and a single structural protein of 56-70 kD. Caliciviruses in the family Caliciviridae are currently divided into 4 genera: 1) Vesivirus; 2) Lagovirus; 3) \"Norwalklike viruses\" (NLVs); and \"Sapporo-like viruses\" (SLVs) [13] . Vesiviruses cause vesicular lesions and reproductive failure in swine and marine animals or respiratory infections in cats, dogs and calves, but were also isolated from normal animals or reptiles [3, 4, 29, 33, 36] . Lagoviruses cause a fatal liver necrosis and systemic hemorrhage in rabbits [25, 28] . The NLVs include a large group of viruses associated with food-and waterborne viral gastroenteritis in humans, which are subdivided into 2 distinct genogroups represented by the prototype strains, Norwalk virus (NV) and Snow Mountain virus (SMV) [6, 21] . Bovine enteric caliciviruses (BEC), Jena virus and Newbury agent-2 cause diarrhea in calves [2] and were recently characterized as NLVs [5, 24] . The SLVs including Sapporo, Manchester and Parkville viruses are mainly associated with acute, nonbacterial gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide [6, 17, 21, 23, 30, 31] . Porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC), Cowden strain, which causes diarrhea in pigs [10] and is the only cultivable enteric calicivirus [11, 32] , has been identified as a new member in the SLV genus [14] . The caliciviruses associated with gastroenteritis in cats and chickens remain uncharacterized at the molecular level [2] . Detection of the NLVs and SLVs in feces from normal and diarrheic pigs or calves [5, 24, 34, 37, 38, 40] raises public health concern for potential cross-species transmission of enteric caliciviruses and possible cattle or swine reservoirs for enteric caliciviruses related to human caliciviruses.",

With applications and improvements of molecular diagnostic techniques, many newly characterized enteric caliciviruses were more recently found to be responsible for numerous outbreaks of food-and waterborne viral gastroenteritis worldwide [8, 27, 42] . By using RT-PCR with multiple primers based on highly conserved RNA polymerase sequences of many representative or prototype enteric caliciviruses, a large number of new strains of NLV or SLV were detected in stools of people involved in outbreaks of gastroenteritis [8, 19, 40] and also in feces from normal and diarrheic swine and cattle [5, 14, 24, 37, 40] . Moreover, enteric caliciviruses were also detected by RT-PCR in foods, water, sewage, fomites, etc. [12, 21, 35] . Consequently, human caliciviruses (HuCV) have emerged as the leading cause of foodand waterborne viral gastroenteritis in humans [27] . Recently, a newly-designed primer pair, p289/290 has been shown to amplify the partial RNA polymerase regions of both NLVs and SLVs [19] .",

The primers PEC45 ( 4883 TCTGTGGTGCGGTTAGCCTT 4864 ) and PEC46 ( 4312 GTGCTCTATTGCCTGGACTA 4331 ) were designed based on the genomic sequence of PEC/Cowden [15] . We tried the primer pair, p289/290 initially in RT-PCR for amplification of the target regions of the respective caliciviruses because of its broad reactivity with NLVs and SLVs [19] . The RT-PCR was performed by using the Titan one tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Only one primer pair was used in each RT-PCR reaction. Briefly, 5 l of RNA was mixed with 1 l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 25 pmol of a reverse primer. The mixture was incubated at 70 \u2022 C for 10 min and then chilled on ice for 2 min. To each reaction tube was added 1 l of 10 mM dNTPs, 25 pmol of forward primer, 2.5 l of 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 l of 5\u00d7reaction buffer, 1.5 l of 25 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 l of enzyme mix (AMV reverse transcriptase and Taq DNA polymerase).

The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The PCR products of an expected size were purified by using Qiagen quick PCR purification columns (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA), and were either directly sequenced by using an automated DNA sequencer ABI377 or cloned into a TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) first and then sequenced.",

However, if the annealing temperature was set at 50 \u2022 C or higher, no visible bands of expected products were amplified by using RT-PCR. It was noted that RT-PCR using p289/290 correlated with IEM for detecting the MEC from the mink fecal specimens (Table 1) . No products with expected size were amplified from mink fecal samples by RT-PCR using primers GLPSG1/YGDD1, NV35/NV36, NV36/NVp110, NI/NVp110, SR33/SR46, SR33/NV-3, Pol1/Pol2 and Pol1/Pol3.

These products were smaller than those amplified for SMSV 6 and 7, VESV C52 and I55, and primate calicivirus (PCV) (419 bp) by 80 bp [29] . Sequence analysis indicated that the MCV amplicons had a deletion of 80 bp at the 3 end, which might result from the binding of Pol3 to the upper regions of the templates. With primers Pol1/Pol2, a weak product of 350 bp was amplified from MCV 9, but not from MCV 13 and 20. The amplicons with an expected size of 407 bp were also amplified in RT-PCR from the 3 MCV isolates by using primers Hel1/Hel2 based on sequences of the vesivirus helicase regions [29] . These products were not sequenced because of the low yield. No products of expected sizes were amplified by using primers GLPSG1/YGDD1, NV35/NV36, NV36/NVp110, NI/NVp110, SR33/SR46, and PEC45/PEC46. Interestingly, amplicons of 331 bp were obtained in RT-PCR from the 3 MCV isolates by using the primer pair p289/290 at lower annealing temperature (40 to 42 \u2022 C), indicating that this primer pair was very broadly reactive with caliciviruses, including some vesiviruses.",

The recognition of HuCV as an important foodborne pathogen relies largely on the development and improvement of molecular assays for detection of HuCV in stools and other specimens. Because of the great genetic diversity among caliciviruses, multiple primer pairs usually need to be used in RT-PCR for sample examination. A broadly reactive primer pair, p289/290 based on the RNA polymerase sequences of 25 prototype and currently circulating HuCV strains in the NLV and SLV genera was able to detect more viruses in either the NLV or SLV genera than previously designed primers [19] .",

The cultivable MCV were antigenically distinct from FCV and the multiple serotypes of VESV and SMSV by virus neutralization tests [26] . Thus it was of interest to determine the genetic relationships between MEC and MCV. We used primer pair Pol1/Pol3 based on the RNA polymerase sequences of VESV and SMSV [29] and successfully amplified products of 339 bp from all 3 MCV isolates by using RT-PCR. These products were smaller than the expected ones for some VESV and SMSV [29] , because of the 3 deletion (80 bp) that may result from unexpected binding of Pol3 to the upper regions of the templates. By using the primers p289/290, we also obtained the expected products from all 3 MCV isolates. This is further evidence of the extremely broad reactivity of p289/290 to detect not only the NLVs and SLVs, but also some vesiviruses such as the MCV. The enteric caliciviruses associated with diarrhea in pigs, cattle, chicken and dogs were initially detected by EM or IEM [2, 34, 38] , but this method is cumbersome, insensitive and time-consuming to use for large numbers of fecal samples and hence not practical for large scale epidemiologic surveys. Because only a few enteric caliciviruses of animal origin are characterized and limited sequence data are available, the calicivirus broadly reactive primers p289/290 can be used for the clinical diagnosis of enteric caliciviral infections in humans and animals and for environmental monitoring.",

The 3 MCV isolates shared very high nucleotide and aa sequence identities (96-100%) with each other, which correlates with their close antigenic relatedness determined by virus neutralization tests [26] . Similarly, the genetic divergence between MCV and VESV, SMSV and FCV correlated with their antigenic distinctiveness. Usually, the caliciviral RNA polymerase region is more conserved than the capsid region which determines the viral antigenic identity and serotype. It was proposed that viruses with less than 80% aa identity in the complete capsid gene may represent distinct antigenic types or serotypes [16] . Our findings provide a further genetic basis supporting the antigenic distinction between MCV and other vesiviruses. The MCV were the most closely related genetically to CaCV, a recently identified vesivirus genetically different from SMSV/VESV and FCV in the Vesivirus genus [33] . However, the MCV and CaCV may comprise two independent genogroups distinct from VESV/SMSV and FCV in this genus because the MCV shared only 81% aa identity with CaCV even in the highly conserved RNA polymerase region [16, 17] .",

Thus MEC may comprise an independent genogroup distinct from Sapporo/Manchester virus, Houston/90/Parkville virus, London/92 and PEC/Cowden in the SLV genus [17] .",

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the molecular characterization of a MEC associated with diarrhea in mink. Interestingly, NLV genes were detected in cecal contents of slaughtered pigs in Japan [37] and in pooled fecal specimens of farm animals (veal calves and pigs) in the Netherlands [40] , raising public health concerns for potential zoonotic transmission of enteric caliciviruses of animal origin. The MEC is closely related genetically to SLVs, but its source is unknown. In this mink ranch, the mink affected by the diarrhea outbreak were fed raw kidneys and livers from pigs and cattle. It is unknown if such unprocessed animal by-products were contaminated by enteric caliciviruses from swine or cattle and thus were the source of infection for mink. Further studies are needed to clarify if such MEC infect pigs or calves and if these animals and mink are possible reservoirs for enteric caliciviruses potentially transmissible to humans. The origin and the lack of pathogenicity of MCV for mink is of additional interest. It was suggested that MCV from normal mink might originate from marine animals because the affected mink were commonly fed marine by-products and the MCV infection was widespread in mink based on serology [26, 36] . However, the MCV were genetically (this report) and antigenically distinct from the SMSV/VESV [26] .",

The primer pair, p289/290 proved to be very broadly reactive, not only with NLVs and SLVs including the MEC associated with mink diarrhea, but also with the MCV of the Vesivirus genus, indicating that this primer pair can be used for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations.",
