This microorganism accounts for 7 to 40% of all community-acquired pneumonias in children 3 to 15 years of age, with a lower incidence in children under the age of 3 years. Other respiratory illnesses, including tracheobronchitis, bronchopneumonia, pharyngitis, sinusitis, croup, and bronchiolitis have also been associated with M. pneumoniae. In contrast to the acute, short-lived epidemics of some respiratory viral agents, M. pneumoniae is endemic to large communities, with outbreaks occurring every 4 to 7 years.1,2,3 According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most recent outbreak of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MP) in Korea lasted from late summer 2010 to the fall of 2011, with peak positivity rates in community-acquired pneumonia ranging from 23.6% in October 2010 to 62.5% in September 2011.4",

Although clinical manifestations of pneumonia disappear within a few months following recovery from an M. pneumoniae infection, mediators of airway hyperreactivity may continue to be released into the circulation long after the infection has been cleared.",

Each phase was defined as follows; patients at admission phase had acute typical symptoms and signs of pneumonia and laboratory findings, patients at recovery phase had clinically improving symptoms, and patients on follow-up visits 2 months later had no obvious symptoms of pneumonia after recovery. Positive titers were defined as \u22651:160 at admission or a titer \u2265fourfold the admission titer during the symptomatic recovery phase. The time between admission and symptomatic recovery ranged from 7 to 10 days. Clinical recovery was defined as absence of asthmatic symptoms and normal physical examination. We performed viral-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal secretions, and excluded patients with positive results. Nasopharyngeal specimens were independently screened for the presence of common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human coronaviruses, human rhinoviruses, human metapneumoviruses, human adenoviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses, by reverse transcription-PCR using a commercial kit (Seeplex RV 12 ACE Detection, Seegene, Seoul, Korea).",
