KD likely represents an immune reaction to an infectious agent in a genetically susceptible individual. Multiple infectious etiologies have been implicated,including Epstein-Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and varicella zoster virus. The incidence of KD is higher in some ethnic groups, such as Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans, supporting a genetic susceptibility. KD peaks in incidence between 13 and 24 months of age.Diagnosis requires fever for at least 5 days accompanied by four of the following signs: bilateral conjunctivitis, oral mucous membrane changes, peripheral extremity changes, polymorphous rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Acral findings may include erythema, edema, and desquamation (typically delayed), and oral involvement is characterized by mucosal erythema, swollen or fissured lips, and a prominent red tongue. Features of the generalized rash are highly variable, including urticarial, scarlatiniform, morbilliform, and dermatitic morphologies (Figure 3).10 Atypical KD and incomplete KD, forms that are more common in infants, may deviate from the classic presentation, thus requiring a high index of suspicion in this population.11 Laboratory abnormalities, including leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytosis, and elevated acute phase reactants, may herald systemic involvement. The most feared complication of KD is coronary artery aneurysm; this may occur in up to 20% of patients in the absence of therapy, and significant risk remains even with treatment.12 Aspirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are the mainstays of therapy and should be promptly initiated.13 Compared to older patients, infants are more likely to develop coronary artery abnormalities andF I G U R E 1 Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy.

Four-year-old girl with erythematous urticarial papules and purpuric plaques on posterior thighs less likely to respond to IVIG, warranting a low threshold for aggressive treatment. 11 6 | SWEE T SYNDROME Sweet syndrome, a neutrophilic dermatosis more commonly described in the adult population, rarely can present in infants with the acute onset of tender, erythematous papules, and plaques often associated with fever. The earliest reported cases are in the first month of life. Sweet syndrome is thought to be a delayed-type (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction to infection, medications, or malignancy; in the infant population, bacterial or viral upper respiratory infection has most commonly been associated. Rarely, Sweet syndrome may be a sign of immunodeficiency or manifestation of autoinflammatory disease. 14,15 Histopathology in Sweet syndrome demonstrates dermal edema, a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate, and leukocytoclasis without true vasculitis. 14 Diagnosis is based upon satisfying the major criteria of clinical presentation and histopathology, with at least two supporting minor criteria, which include the presence of respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, history of preceding vaccination, or concomitant inflammatory disease, malignancy or pregnancy; malaise and fever; elevated acute phase reactants such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, peripheral blood neutrophilia and leukocytosis; and response to systemic corticosteroid or potassium iodide treatment. The rapid improvement of symptoms upon initiation of systemic corticosteroids is strongly supportive of the diagnosis. 16 Cardiac manifestations are a significant cause of morbidity, including pericarditis, dilation of the great vessels, valvular disease, and myocardial infarction. The mortality rate is 9% in the general pediatric population, though even greater in infants and those with cardiac involvement. 14 7 | ERY THEMA MULTIFORME Erythema multiforme (EM) is characterized by acute onset of symmetrically distributed targetoid skin lesions with variable mucosal involvement. EM is rare in infants, but has been reported as early as the first few months of life. 17 The pathogenesis involves a virally induced cell-mediated immune reaction in genetically susceptible individuals; herpes simplex virus (HSV) being the most frequent precipitant. Skin lesions initially appear as erythematous to violaceous macules and evolve to the classic targetoid plaque composed of a peripheral ring of erythema, a zone of edema, and central duskiness heralding epidermal necrosis, which may progress to vesiculation or blistering (Figure 4). Mucosal involvement when present predominantly affects the lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa, with fragile bullae quickly unroofing to reveal tender erosions and crusting of the lips. 18Constitutional symptoms are typically limited to generalized malaise, low-grade fever, and discomfort associated with the eruption. Histopathologic features include an interface dermatitis with degeneration of basal epidermal cells, keratinocyte necrosis, and a superficial dermal perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate.18 Most episodes of EM heal over 2-3 weeks, but recurrences can become cyclical in a small subset of patients; rare instances of this phenomenon have been described in infants.19 Management includes a careful assessment for systemic infection and supportive measures for pain, poor oral intake, and wound care. Prophylactic therapy with systemic antiviral medication should be considered for patients with HSV-associated recurrent EM.18", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "subset of the cutaneous hypersensitivity syndromes can be grouped by their shared presentation with urticarial or urticaria-like lesions.

As with typical urticaria, individual skin lesions tend to resolve within 24 hours, while there may be ongoing eruption of new lesions for 1-2 weeks. Histology is similar to that of acute urticaria, demonstrating dermal edema and sparse perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of neutrophils and eosinophils. AAU can be differentiated from EM by the presence of pruritus rather than pain, the absence of skin necrosis and blistering, and transient nature of individual lesions. 20 Management of the eruption is achieved with systemic antihistamines; evaluation for a precipitating infectious source is warranted and any implicated medications should be discontinued.
