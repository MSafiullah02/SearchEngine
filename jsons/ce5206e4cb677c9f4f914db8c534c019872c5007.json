Significant gaps persist in our knowledge of COVID-19 epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management, despite (or possibly because of) the fact that the outbreak is an unprecedented global threat. On the positive side, enough is currently known about the epidemic process to permit the construction of mathematical predictive models. We construct and analyze here one first step: that of adapting a traditional SEIR epidemic model to the specific dynamic compartments and epidemic parameters of COVID-19, as it spreads in an age-heterogeneous community. We analyze the current management strategy of the epidemic course (travel bans, service closures and interruptions, social distancing). We generate predictions, and assess the efficiency of these control measures, in the context in which their sustainability is currently being questioned.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak originated in December 2019, from a single focus in the Wuhan region (China) and over the course of less than three months has spread to every continent except Antarctica, affecting at this point 193 countries and territories, with more than 400,000 worldwide infections to date (more than 50,000 in the US alone) and over 18,000 fatalities (over 600 in the US, and growing). Depending on the age and immune system of each individual, clinical manifestations vary from mild to severe, to life threatening. Most critical complications (like severe pneumonia, acute cardiac injury, septic shock) have been reported to have highest prevalence in the > 80 age bracket (with the mortality rate increasing from children, to young adults and adults, to the elderly). In the incipient stages of the epidemic, the public concern was curbed by the relatively low overall COVID-19 mortality rate (3.3%)-comparable with the rates of less threatening viral epidemics, such as the seasonal flu, rather than with those of notorious outbreaks like Ebola ( 50%), or SARS ( 10%). What first started to raise a strong reason for concern was the faster spread (R 0 \u223c 2.2) via only mildly symptomatic cases. It became increasingly apparent over the following weeks of the outbreak that its control required international coordination. Three months down the line-after unprecedented global and local travel bans, functional shutdown of many branches of economic, educational and social life; after city and even country-wide mandated quarantines and self isolations-the epidemic is far from subsiding, raising huge survival, economic and sustainability concerns.",

Children and young adults exposed to the virus can be contaminated as much as the more advanced age groups. However, their milder symptoms can pass undetected, and they can more easily act as carriers of the virus, effectively unrestrictedly spreading it to others. On the other hand, the elderly population is more likely to exhibit serious to critical symptoms post exposure. The mortality rates differ correspondingly between their age groups.

The general population was asked to either quarantine or observe social distancing, depending upon suspicion of active symptoms, and upon the gravity of the local situation.

Understandably, there are necessities (e.g., for food or medical care) that may send people out of their homes. One can use a model to understand what are the best strategies when it comes to planning and timing a trip and protection throughout it, taking into consideration the known lifetime of the virus in various media. Along a similar line, one can study the effects of potential psychological aspect of social distancing. The general expectation is that a sufficiently long and efficient isolation will successfully curb the exponential increase. One of the consequences will be people's reaction to the seemingly diminished risk of infection, especially perceived after a psychologically straining period of disruption in social life. There is a risk that an isolation protocol relaxed too soon may facilitate a fresh surge of the outbreak. A model can incorporate this aspect, and predict the potential magnitude of such as effect.",

The proportionality constant \u03b2 is the product of the per capita contact rate and the probability of infection after contact with an infected individual. The infection rate is normalized by the factor N (t), representing the total population at time t: N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t). The rate of transfer from the latent to the infectious stage is a fraction \u03b4 of the number of latent individuals -where 1/\u03b4 is the average time for a latent individual to become infectious. The rate of recovery is a fraction \u03b3 of the infectious population, where 1/\u03b3 is the average time it takes a person to die or recover once in the infectious stage.

In the next modeling steps, when people are allowed traffic to different locations, the rate \u03b2 will also be location dependent, since different places observe different hygiene protocols, and different social patterns. The second proportionality factor in the infection term changes to \u03a3 I +q\u03a3 E , where \u03a3 I = age I age and \u03a3 E = age E age . This is because individuals in a specific age group are equally exposed to infected and exposed people from all four age groups that interact in one location. Among the number of individuals [\u03b4(age) + d(age)]E age that leave the exposed compartment, we distinguish between the number \u03b4(age)E age , which develop symptoms, and d(age)E age , which never become symptomatic, and return to the susceptible compartment. After an infectious period, individuals leave their respective I age compartment, and move into either the recovered compartment R age or the fatalities compartment D age , in proportions respectively established by the coefficients \u03b3 R (age) and \u03b3 D (age). A proportion g of the recovered individuals loses immunity, and moves back to the Susceptible compartment. The age-specific infection and recovery rates are shown in Table 1 , together with the references on which they were based.

Since little is known about immunity, for the purpose of this study it was assumed to last 60 days and be ageindependent (leading to a value of g = 0.0167 common to all age groups).

We will investigate the effects of this aspect by adjusting the mobility matrix to allow more exposed and infected individuals to have access to diagnosis, and subsequently choose not to travel.

In each panel, the number of Susceptible individuals is shown in blue, the Exposed in pink, the Infected in red, the Recovered in green and the Fatalities in black. Figures 1 and 2 show the long term dynamics of the system in absence of any isolation, quarantine or closure measures. Figure 1 illustrates the interplay between SEIR compartments (shown in different colors) for each of the four age groups (captured as a different panel). Figure 2 illustrates a comparison between age groups (shown in different line styles) in each of the four SEIR compartments (shown in separate panels). There is a period of seemingly exponential growth in infections, followed by a peak at around 100 days, and a decline, with the number of fatalities monotonically increasing towards a different asymptotic value for each group (largest in the elderly, smaller in adults, etc). We will observe how these dynamics are affected by shutting down different locations at a specific time in the system's evolution. In further illustrations, we will focus in particular on the number of infected cases, on recovered individuals and on fatalities. The most common strategies applied in response to the COVID-19 epidemic have focused more on mandated closures than requiring social distancing. Around the US, university campuses were among the first to dramatically limit their traffic (to the point where it can be considered negligible), followed by completely closing school districts, and within a couple of weeks by additionally shutting down activity in restaurant, bars and entertainment venues. In Figures 3, 4 and 5, we illustrate the effect of independently closing these three locations to all traffic. The closures are introduced in the model at the approximate time in the course of the infection as they were implemented to the field. Even when implemented early in the process, the effect of each of the three measures taken separately was predicted to be rather limited, both in size and in terms of the age groups it affected. Closing the campus produced a small, but noticeable effect in Young adults, lowering (but not visibly shifting) the infection curve, and slightly diminishing fatalities in this specific age compartment. The effect on other age groups appears negligible, hence this cannot be viewed as an efficient control measure to apply in and of itself. This effect is restricted to the social dynamics within the community, limiting the campus interaction of Young adults with the other age compartments, which were only indirectly affected by its closure. The simulation did not include Young adult exodus from the community upon campus closure, or increasing traffic to other locations to compensate, which will both be addressed in our future work on coupled communities.",

However, this effect may be substantially underestimated by the nature of our model, limiting the interaction of children with other age compartments to that occurring at home. While Young adults in a community of primarily college students are likely to observe more separation once in their own homes (single living), children will interact with their families, even when not with others. These dynamics cannot be intrinsically captured by a simple, single community SEIR model, and would require further compartmentalization. Closing the bars has a qualitatively different effect, due to both the specific social dynamics and also to the nature of the interactions being restricted (a place with high exposure \u03b2 is being eliminated). Figure 5 suggests that even a slightly delayed closure (25 days) visibly lowers the infection curve in all compartments (including Children, who do not directly attend bars in our model), slightly shifts the infection curves to the right and diminishes the asymptotic number of fatalities. Link tracing the infection networks in various geographic regions suggests that the most significant community contamination has been occurring at religious / spiritual gatherings (church and synagogue services, weddings, etc.) A notorious patient #31 in Korea reportedly infected in February over 1,160 individuals in her Shincheonji Church of Jesus congregation by attending service twice after onset of symptoms [5]. One of the initial large spikes in infections was observed in New York City the week of March 17, due to a quick spreading in tightly knit Jewish communities in Westchester [7] and Brooklyn [6]. Many churches have been heavily criticized for continuing to observe specific rites which contravened the hygiene and distancing directives given in conjunction with the pandemic (people in close proximity, using the same spoon and cup for communion [8, 9] ). Starting with March 23rd, many churches have announced suspension of services, or no-attendance services [10].",

We then completely shut down attendance (updating the mobility matrix) at day 25 from the original infection. Figure 6 shows that completely closing down these events produces an effect comparable to that of the bar and restaurant shutdown, with a lowering and slight shift in infection curves; it was also accompanied by decreasing fatalities across the board for all ages. While each of these closures considered independently creates only a small effect on lowering fatalities and infection spread (hence the number of people in potential need of treatment), as well as on shifting the epidemic timeline -they appear very efficient when applied in combination. Figure 7 illustrates this crucial combined effect of \"flattening the curve,\" and subsequently leading to a significant reduction of both infection and fatalities in all age groups. In the context of this outbreak potentially challenging our health care capacity, the decrease in the infection maximum value is crucial, but the delay can also be of great practical importance, allowing time for a more prepared medical response to the occurrence of this maximum. However, even in combination, these mandated closures do not offer much hope, with a prediction of close to 200 Young adult, 600 Adult and 800 Elderly fatalities. In real life, we must be able to improve this prediction.",
