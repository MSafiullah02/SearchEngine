            "text": "For the most part, little is known about emerging pathogens before they emerge so, frequently, viruses from zoonotic sources that are unrecognized present a unique challenge to science and medicine. A zoonosis is an infection caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi transferred from a non-human animal to humans. 1 Zoonotic transmission may be due to a spillover event from an animal to a human, which is caused by a sustained or new close human contact or by climate changes that affect the distribution of disease vectors, e.g.; insects that have been previously restricted geographically through the effects of climate changes. Evolution of a pathogen that has been previously animal-restricted can cause a virus to emerge-one that is capable of utilizing a human receptor or the cellular machinery needed to cause infection. 2 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large enveloped, positive strand RNA viruses. These viruses fall into four genera: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. The two CoV subtypes known to affect humans (HCoVs) are alpha and beta. Four HCoVs including HCoV229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 account for 10%-30% of adult respiratory infections and are endemic globally. The ecologically diverse coronavirus occurs most prevalently in bats which serve as a host reservoir. 3 The mild types of CoVs in humans, which cause the common cold, gained little attention until 2002 when the virus emerged from Guangdong Province, China causing cases of severe atypical pneumonia. This disease, which became known as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, caused world-wide concern when it spread to 37 countries. 4 The causative agent was SARS-CoV and bats were determined to be the zoonotic reservoir. Subsequent transmission to humans transpired from civets (an Asian animal related to the mongoose and weasel) which had become infected by a bat. 4, 5 Globally, this virus affected more than 8,000 people and had a 10% fatality rate. 6 Following SARS, MERS-CoV emerged in 2012 from the Middle Eastern Arabian Peninsula.",

            "text": "Like SARS, the origin host for MERS-CoV is the bat but the transmitting animal is typically the dromedary camel. The virus has infected 1728 people, since its emergence, and has had a 35.6% mortality rate since August of 2016. 7 Recently, in December of last year, coronavirus re-emerged, once again from China, with the initial outbreak in Wuhan, a city located in the country's Hubei Province. It has since been designated as SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting disease is called COVID-2019 8 . Close to 300,000 cases, globally, have been reported, since its outbreak. The point of origin is considered to be a seafood/animal market in Wuhan which houses and sells, not only fish, but exotic animals including hedgehogs, badgers, snakes, and birds (turtledoves). 8, 9 This new virus, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, is also a beta subtype and its exact animal host/reservoir has yet to be determined. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that environmental samples taken from the marketplace came back positive for COVID-2019. Its similarity to SARS is found in the predominant human receptor for the SARS S glycoprotein, human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found primarily in the lower respiratory tract, rather than in the upper airway. 3 This may be a partial explanation for the severe respiratory symptoms and consequences of both diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). When cases were being confirmed in people who had not visited the Wuhan seafood market or been in its proximity, suspicions arose that the virus was being transmitted from person to person. 10 A study published by the New England Journal of Medicine of the first 435 patients that were infected with the new virus, in Wuhan, found that the median age was 59 years old (range of 15-89 yrs.), 56% were male, and that no children < 15yrs had contracted the disease. 11 Since this study, however, a retrospective study at Wuhan University that was published in JAMA has reported that 9 infants had contracted COVID-2019 ranging in age from 1-11mos. of which seven were female. 12 The first confirmed U.S. case of COVID-2019 was diagnosed in the state of Washington, on January 30, 2020, resulting from person to person contact, and was it determined to be caused through international travel to Wuhan, China. 13 This, also, is the date the rapidly spreading virus was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the International Health Regulations (IHR) emergency committee of the WHO. PHEIC is defined by the WHO as \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease; and to potentially require a coordinated international response.\" This definition implies a situation that: \"is serious, unusual, or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected State's national border;",

Often considered the 'front door' of the healthcare system primary care should be involved in planning and action for health emergency risk management 27 . It is important that there is close coordination between clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal level. From a clinical perspective, when a patient presents with fever and respiratory symptoms (in particular a dry cough), clinicians should obtain a detailed travel history. CDC guidelines for health care professionals for evaluating patients' epidemiological risks, in conjunction with the characteristic symptoms of COVID-2019 can be found on its website. When symptoms, travel history, and relevant illness exposure raises suspicion for COVID-2019, the state or local health department should be immediately notified.",

Slowing U.S. transmission of COVID-2019 is critical and the fact that primary care providers play an important role has already become evident, since the December emergence of this virus. This has been demonstrated by the detection of eight of the first eleven U.S. cases by clinicians who then collaborated with public health officials to test persons at risk. 28 Both early recognition and an increased understanding of the virus by health care providers can reduce transmission. 27 ",

The rapid identification and containment of this virus by China's public health authorities reflects the increasing global capacity to detect, identify, and define new outbreaks. 29 The disease has met all three criteria for a pandemic: 1). Caused by an illness and fatalities are related to this illness; 2). has had sustained person to person spread, and recently; 3) worldwide spread. . 8 A concerted and collaborative global effort, based on sharing experiences from all geographical regions and all disciplines, should continue to be led and coordinated by the WHO with an emphasis placed on containment, surveillance, and prevention in addition to rapid dissemination of clinical information related to the care of patients with this infection. This effort can start with early detection of the virus by primary health care providers through an awareness of COVID 2019 characteristics and recognition of possible cases, which is then followed by, if needed, coordination with public health systems. The key to sustaining and further development of the progress being made toward the management and containment of COVID-2019 is the sharing of experiences and knowledge garnered from all geographical regions and across all disciplines. 27 The perpetual challenge of emerging infections and the importance of sustained preparedness has been underscored by a novel coronavirus from which pathogens have caused a global human disease.",

Among this number, there have been 400 deaths. 8 The hardest hit state thus far has been New York. A global pandemic stemming from the virus was officially declared by the WHO on March 11.

            "text": "-this could characterize this population as high risk for COVID-2019. A retrospective study of nine Chinese pregnant women from Wuhan who were in late pregnancy and who had contracted the virus (all of whom delivered during the course of their illness) demonstrated that there was non-vertical transmission of the disease.19 Typical symptoms of the virus were exhibited in these women and none developed pneumonia or died. Zhu et al confirmed non-vertical transmission in a study of 8 neonates born to Chinese women who had COVID-2019.20 A larger cohort of 38 pregnant women studied by Schwartz included the nine women from Wuhan and others from areas surrounding the epicenter of the viral outbreak.Again, it was demonstrated that there were no cases of viral related maternal pneumonia or death and no vertical transmission to the neonates.21 In children, so far, mostly the very young appear to become infected. For example, in nine infants studied by Wei et al, who tested positive for COVID-2019, some had fever, others exhibited mild respiratory symptoms, and others had no symptoms at all. The latter group had been exposed to family members so they had been tested. No infants developed complications.12 A second study of children with COVID-2019 published at a later date and conducted by Dong et al had a much larger cohort of 2143 children from China, demonstrating spread of the disease.Most of the cases in this study were mild and, in comparison to infected adults who had severe or critical disease in the same time frame (18.5 %),22 only 5.9% of children had a similar progression of the disease. Only one child in this study died. The reduced clinical severity of COVID-2019 in children is not understood but is thought to be related to both exposure and host factors. There is also speculation that children are less sensitive because the binding ability, in other words, the maturity and function of ACE2 (discussed earlier) may be lower in children in comparison to adults. Children under the age of one year were the most affected, in this study-10.6 %, followed by those 1-5 years old, 7.3%, suggesting that young children particularly infants are the most vulnerable to COVID-2019.23 Diagnosis/EvaluationInfection control measures should be implemented, when COVID-2019 is suspected, with immediate isolation. A focus should be made on early recognition. Persons presenting with fever and/or lower respiratory tract symptoms who have had recent travel to a heavily affected region within14 days or those who have had close contact with a person either suspected of having the infection or having been confirmed as infected, should be considered as potentially infected and be tested. According to the CDC, if an individual is severely ill and no etiology has been determined, even if there has been no known exposure COVID-2019, testing should be done. 8Collection of specimens to test for COVID-2019 virus from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab) should be obtained. Sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchioalveolar lavage specimens are recommended as well, if possible, from the lower tract.Additional specimens (e.g., stool, urine) may also be collected. 8,10 COVID-2019 virus is detected by polymerase chain reaction; in the United States, testing is performed by the CDC or a CDCqualified lab. 8,15 Specimen collection should be done by personnel wearing appropriate PPE including gown, gloves, eye protection, and a mask that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator mask. 8, Critical shortages of PPE are being acknowledged by hospitals worldwide at this time.Treatment/PreventionTreatment is primarily supportive to help relieve symptoms such as analgesics for fever and oxygen for hypoxia as well as infection control measures. If the disease is severe, measures should be taken to support vital organ function. The WHO recommends that corticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) due to the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients10,24 The following two retrospective studies of patients hospitalized in Wuhan,China with the COVID-2019 virus outline implemented treatment regimens. In a study by Chen et al, in addition to supportive measures, at the Jinyintan Hospital some patients were given antibiotics, thirteen patients received non-invasive mechanical ventilator treatment, and four required invasive ventilation treatment. 5 At Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, patients, according to the study by Huang et al, in addition to supportive care, patients received antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]) and many received antibiotics. ICU patients received highflow oxygen, or noninvasive ventilation. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 17 patients. 17 For patients with mild infection, who can be adequately isolated in an outpatient setting, home management may be appropriate, if they have no underlying chronic conditions e.g.; heart or lung disease, renal failure or immunocompromising conditions. Management of such patients should focus on prevention of transmission to others, and monitoring for clinical deterioration, which should be reported immediately to public health officials and would prompt hospitalization 8,10 Remdesivir and Chloroquine, both broad spectrum antivirals, were tested recently in vitro by Wang et al for efficacy against COVID-2019. Both drugs showed an ability to control the virus. 25 Remdesivir was compassionately used in the first U.S. patient confirmed with COVID-2019 in the state of Washington due to this person's worsening clinical condition. 13 Compassionate use of an unapproved drug is when a patient's condition is serious and no other treatment options are available. Wang et al have recommended use of both Chloroquine and Remdesivir in persons who have this virus. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these drugs in patients with this infection, in keeping with the WHO's recommendation for of avoidance of their use.",
