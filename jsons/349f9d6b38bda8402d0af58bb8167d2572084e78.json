            "text": "Pangolins, or scaly anteaters, have recently been flagshiped as one of the most illegally traded mammals, and as a corollary, as potential intermediate hosts at the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to improve the traceability of their trade, we developed 20 polymorphic microsatellite loci for the white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis), the species most frequently found on African bushmeat markets. We genotyped 24 white-bellied pangolins from the Douala market, Cameroon, originating from the Ebo forest c. 75 km north-east of Douala. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 12 (mean = 6.95), and mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.592 (0.208-0.875) and 0.671 (0.469-0.836), respectively. Genetic diversity was higher than that cross-estimated from microsatellite loci developed for other species of pangolins. Two loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and two loci showed linkage disequilibrium. Genetic variance (PCoA) was increased with the addition of 13 pangolins of unknown origin, possibly suggesting that the Douala market is fed from differentiated source populations of white-bellied pangolins. Each of the 37 individuals had a unique multilocus genotype. The unbiased probability of identity (uPI) and the probability of identity among siblings (PIsibs) were both very low (uPI = 8.443 e\u221221; PIsibs = 1.011 e\u221207). Only five microsatellite loci were needed to reach the conservative value of PIsibs < 0.01, overall indicating a powerful discriminating power of our combined loci. These 20 newly developed microsatellite loci might prove useful in tracing the local-to-global trade of the white-bellied pangolin, and will hopefully contribute to the DNA-assisted implementation of future conservation strategies at reasonable costs.",

Pangolins, or scaly anteaters, have recently been flagshiped as one of the most illegally traded mammals, being literally eaten to extinction [2] . Based on reports from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a minimum number of c. 895,000 African and Asian pangolins were trafficked during the last decade (2010-2019). They were mainly destined to Asian markets including China and Vietnam [3] , where they feed the growing demand from the Traditional Chinese Medicine market [4] . As a corollary, the pangolin trade has very recently been pinpointed as posing a serious threat to human health, pangolins being potentially involved in the COVID-19 pandemic [5, 6] . Pangolins are also part of the traditional Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https ://doi.org/10.1007/s1103 3-020-05511 -6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

The traceability of the pangolin trade is rendered difficult by the elusive, international criminal networks that fuel the market, but also by the various forms under which pangolins are traded. Indeed, a large spectrum of pangolinrelated 'items' are involved in the trade, from scales alone to smoked skins, boiled and 'pealed' carcasses, chopped meat, scale powder and embryo soups [10] [11] [12] .

To date, a certain number of mitochondrial, nuclear and Y-borne genes have been sequenced in pangolins [14] [15] [16] [17] , providing useful resources for the accurate 'tagging' of the species involved in the trade [18] . On the other hand, our ability to trace the geographic origins of seized pangolins has remained limited because of a lack of exhaustive DNA registers and the reduced geographic resolution of traditional gene sequencing [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Although microsatellite loci were developed in an Asian (Manis javanica) and an African species (Smutsia temminckii) [24, 25] , their application to the issue of the traceability of the trade remains limited or pending [26, 27] . Recently, single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs) have successfully been used to assign seizures of M. javanica to potential geographic sources in South-East Asia [28] . So far, no genotyping approach has been applied to assess the number of individuals involved in large (scale) seizures, despite the potential advantage this would have for seizure processing [29] .",

It is one of the most frequent mammalian species observed on the stalls of the range countries' bushmeat markets [35] [36] [37] [38] . The species is also likely undergoing heavy international trade pressure as it has been the constituent of large seizures both in Africa and Asia since 2010 [39] .",

The library was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform using a nano 2 (500 cycles) sequencing chip. The resulting paired-end reads which passed Illumina's chastity filter were subject to de-multiplexing and trimming of Illumina adaptor residuals. Subsequently, the quality of the surviving reads was checked with the software FastQC 0.117 (https ://www. bioin forma tics.babra ham.ac.uk/proje cts/fastq c). In a next step, the paired-end reads were merged with the software USEARCH 10.0.240 [40] to reform in silico the sequenced molecule. The resulting reads were screened with the software Tandem Repeats Finder 4.09 [41] . After this process, 8,488 merged reads contained a microsatellite insert with a tetra-or a trinucleotide of at least six repeat units or a dinucleotide of at least 10 repeat units. Primer design was performed with Primer 3 4.1.0 [42] . Suitable primer design was possible in 6,025 microsatellite candidates. Individual tests for amplification and polymorphism of the 48 best primerdesigned loci were performed on 14 individuals (from the western central African and Gabon lineages; see [17] ), after which 20 polymorphic markers were retained (Table 1) . Overall, eight loci were di-nucleotide, three tri-nucleotide and nine tetra-nucleotide repeats.",

Only five microsatellite loci were needed to reach the conservative value of PIsibs < 0.01 [53] , overall indicating a powerful discriminating power of our combined loci. This could have important conservation implications, as notably regarding the individual-based management of in situ and ex situ populations [54, 55] and the accurate assessment of the number of individuals contained in large seizures of scales [29] . Although China has temporarily banned the wildlife trade, the durable effect and efficiency of law enforcement on this illegal market remains questionable [56] and accurate tools will be needed to trace the consumption of pangolins. Genetic variance was increased through the addition of pangolins with unknown origin (altEbo), involving the potential presence of 'outliers' along the axes 1 and 2 of the PCoA (14.88% cumulated variation; Fig. 1 ), in agreement with the interviewees' answers regarding the origin of pangolins. Although our results are preliminary, this may suggest that the Douala market network is fed from differentiated source populations of white-bellied pangolins, but this working hypothesis will have to be tested further with an accurate geographic representation of pangolin populations. The set of microsatellite loci that we have developed significantly adds to the molecular toolbox available for the species, and will hopefully contribute to the fine-scale implementation of future conservation strategies at reasonable costs. Because the previously published, cross-amplified loci were not validated on a sufficient number of geographically traceable samples, we recommend the use of our 20 newly developed microsatellite loci for population genetic studies on the white-bellied pangolin and related conservation and forensic applications.
