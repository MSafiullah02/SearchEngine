Pregnancy is a special physiological condition with unique characteristics, including altered immunity and hormone levels which is required to tolerate and support the development and survival of the placenta and fetus in the hostile maternal immune system environment (Robinson and Klein 2012). Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women are more severely affected by pathogenic infections, particularly those caused by respiratory pathogens, including the influenza and SARS viruses (Kourtis et al. 2014; Sappenfield et al. 2013; Wong et al. 2004). A study had previously reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in nine pregnant women (Chen H et al. 2020). However, the study primarily focused on the clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women. The changes in clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of the pregnant women both before and after the delivery were not explored.",

The plasma D-dimer levels during the prepartum period were normal and comparable between pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection and those without (Fig. 3B). However, D-dimer levels of four patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection increased significantly postpartum, but did not change in the five patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S1).

            "text": "During pregnancy, several mechanical and pathophysiological adaptive changes occur in the respiratory system, including a decrease in respiratory volumes, increased oxygen consumption, and edema of the respiratory tract mucosa, which can render them intolerant to hypoxia. Moreover, immune adaptations are required to accommodate the fetus (Kourtis et al. 2014). Therefore, pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia. Previous studies have reported relatively more severe cases with higher mortality rates among pregnant women upon contracting respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and SARS virus (Gottfredsson 2008; Jamieson et al. 2009; Wong et al. 2004). Pregnant SARS-CoV-2 patients reportedly presented with a similar pattern of clinical characteristics to that of non-pregnant adult patients (Chen H et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020). An investigation in 138 hospitalized patients with COVID showed that 98.6% patients had clinical manifestations of fever, 69.6% patients had fatigue, and 59.4% patients had dry cough. In addition, 70.3% patients had lymphopenia and 39.9% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans showed that all patients presented bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients (Wang et al. 2020). Another descriptive study in 99 cases with COVID reported that 83% patients had fever, 82% patients had cough, and 31% patients had shortness of breath. Other clinical manifestations include muscle ache, confusion, headache, sore throat and so on. The imaging examination showed that 75% patients presented bilateral pneumonia, 14% patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity (Chen N et al. 2020). Here, four patients had no symptoms during the observation period; additionally, the only symptom observed in the remaining patients was fever. The liver enzyme levels in all eight patients were also normal. As far as the imaging features were concerned, the typical signs of viral infection-ground-glass opacity in the lungs were also mild. Therefore, according to our study, SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant patients appeared to present with relatively milder clinical symptoms than non-pregnant adult patients.",

Correspondingly, WBC counts increased while LYMPH counts decreased in most pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, CRP levels increased considerably higher than those observed during general pregnancy. During pregnancy, the concentrations of steroid hormones such as estrogens and progesterone progressively increase over the course of pregnancy (Vojtek et al. 2018). In addition, to ensure that the mother\u2019s body can actively tolerate the semi-allogeneic fetus, the immune system is modulated (Vojtek et al. 2018). However, there is a sudden and substantial decrease in steroid hormone concentrations during the immediate postpartum period (Dennis et al. 2008). In comparison to the third trimester of pregnancy, there is a significant change in immune cells including the blood phagocytes, pDCs, NK cells, and T cells during the post-partum period (Kraus et al. 2012). It is possible that these alterations in both the hormones and immune system trigger the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection following partum. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the immunological differences between pre- and post-partum in the context of combating a SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
