Although the virus infects individuals of all ages, epidemiological reports demonstrate that older age is a significant contributing factor for symptomatic presentation, severe disease course, and death [1]. This is illustrated by the significant increase in case fatality rates (CFR) with age. In China, the CFR of the general populace is 2.3% with rates skyrocketing to 8.0% and 14.8% in patients 70\u201379 and over 80, respectively [2]. In Italy, reports of case fatality are even higher, with 8.6% in individuals 60\u201369 years, 12.8% in individuals 70\u201379 years, and 20.2% in individuals over 80 years [2].",

As COVID-19 demonstrates the potential for both respiratory and aerosol transmission, otolaryngologists (ENTs) are at an elevated risk working in close proximity to the upper respiratory tract within the head and neck region [6,7]. Due to the vast diversity in diagnostic and operative procedures performed on the upper airway within ENT, there is a high risk of aerosolization, leading to the potential for transmission of high viral loads to the provider [8]. The director of an intensive care unit in Wuhan, China commented that otolaryngologists and ophthalmologists were infected at higher rates when compared to other doctors in the same hospitals, and the same trends are reported in Europe [9]. In response, an international collaboration among thirteen institutions has put forth recommendations to ensure the safety of the otolaryngology community throughout the course of this pandemic [10].",

For essential urgent and emergent procedures, which must proceed despite the risks, determination of whether to use powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) versus N95s should be assessed by each institution as both forms of masks offer distinct advantages and disadvantages [16]. However, at a minimum, otolaryngologists should don a respirator, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves [17]. Moreover, studies from the Ebola outbreak reported that in some circumstances, up to 79.2% of providers self-contaminated while removing PPE [18]; therefore, careful consideration must be applied to doffing PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

First, in addition to age, clinical comorbidities, male sex, and smoking history also play significant roles in the risk of developing severe complications secondary to COVID-19 infection [20]. Furthermore, risk of exposure is also highly dependent on local institutional practices, availability of resources such as personal protective equipment, and the scope of the hospital staff available to assist in the care for COVID-19 patients [21], which are not factored into our model. Although the provider data from 2018 was the most recent data available from the AAMC, it may not exactly reflect the current workforce in each state, since there may have been movement or retirements since the data was released in 2018.",
