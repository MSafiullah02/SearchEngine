Bayesian statistical approaches have been employed as a solution to the lack of a \"gold standard\" (Geurden et al . 2008 , Papini et al . 2013 , but these demand a high number of samples, which are frequently difficult to obtain in clinical settings. In the present study, both the ZnSO 4 and SNAP were selected as reference methods because they are commonly used tests by many veterinary diagnostic laboratories, have been included in numerous studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of novel assays and have been employed in various large-scale Giardia spp prevalence studies (Gundlach et al . 2005 , Carlin et al . 2006 , Dryden et al . 2006 , Geurden et al . 2008 , Epe et al . 2010 , Rishniw et al . 2010 , Becker et al . 2012 ).

Therefore, we propose that the Single and Triple Rapid kits may be helpful in the in-house diagnosis of Giardia species infection in the U.K. However, in high prevalence settings or where clinical suspicion is high, and a negative Single or Triple rapid result is obtained, a Giardia species infection cannot be ruled out as these tests, particularly the Single Rapid, exhibited lower sensitivity when compared to the combined results of the ZnSO 4 and SNAP tests.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 446, "end": 465, "text": "(Guest et al . 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 466, "end": 484, "text": ", Epe et al . 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "None of the authors of this article has a financial or personal relationship with other people or organisations that could inappropriately influence or bias the content of the paper.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflict of interest"}, {"text": "both methods (Se: 0\u00b765 to 0\u00b785) (Mekaru et al . 2007 , Geurden et al . 2008 , Rishniw et al . 2010 ). However, it has been shown that when the SNAP is used in parallel with ZnSO 4 , and the generated results are compared to those obtained by employing direct immunofluorescence as the \"gold standard,\" the combined sensitivity improves to such a degree (from 0\u00b785 to 0\u00b798) that the SNAP becomes particularly useful in an in-hospital setting (Mekaru et al . 2007 ) .

In addition, a recent European study on the presence of Giardia spp in samples collected from symptomatic dogs reported a prevalence in the UK of 14\u00b76% (Epe et al . 2010 ). In the present study, approximately 50% of the samples were selected to be positive for Giardia spp. Although this intentional bias allowed an adequate evaluation of the diagnostic performance of the new Rapid point-of-care kits, it resulted in an artificially higher prevalence to those reported previously. Due to this bias, PPV and NPV were also estimated for different prevalence rates as recently suggested for the evaluation of new diagnostic tests (Erb 2011 ) . The values of 7, 15 and 20% were selected in order to reflect an approximate range of the published prevalence rates for the Giardia spp in the U.K. , Epe et al . 2010 , Upjohn et al . 2010 ). In the current study, the PPV for both Rapid tests were high at all prevalence rates, indicating that a positive result generated by the Single or Triple test is almost certainly a true positive. Conversely, the NPV were lower at the high prevalence rate but improved markedly almost to 100% as the prevalence decreased, especially when the samples were analysed with the Triple Rapid test. This means that the likelihood of a false negative is higher in the high prevalence setting. However, if the prior probability of infection is low, then a negative result is almost certainly a true negative, and therefore, either Rapid test will have a reasonable chance of ruling out Giardia species as the cause of the clinical signs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 181, "text": "(Upjohn et al . 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 337, "end": 354, "text": "(Epe et al . 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 813, "end": 824, "text": "(Erb 2011 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 976, "end": 994, "text": ", Epe et al . 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 995, "end": 1016, "text": ", Upjohn et al . 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflict of interest"}, {"text": "There are some limitations to our study.
