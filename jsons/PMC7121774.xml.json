            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of posttranscriptional gene silencing induced by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that mediate sequence-specific cleavage of the cognate RNA transcripts and in turn trigger complete degradation of the disruptive RNA fragments, resulting in reduction or loss of gene activities [1, 2]. During the processes of RNAi-mediated gene silencing, the dsRNAs are first recognized and cleaved into 21- to 23-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes with symmetrical 2-nt 3\u2032 overhangs by dsRNA-specific RNase III-related endonuclease, Dicer [3, 4]. The produced siRNAs are efficiently incorporated into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to form a ribonucleoprotein complex that first unwinds the siRNA duplexes and selectively degrades the sense strand of siRNA. The single antisense siRNA-coupled RISC is afterwards guided to catalyze the endonucleolytic cleavage of homologous RNA transcripts at the site where the antisense siRNAs is complementarily bound [5, 6]. Subsequently, the resulting cleaved RNA fragments are immediately subjected to exonucleolytic destruction by the action of exoribonuclease.",

Recently, it has become an extremely powerful study tool for reverse functional genomics [12\u201315] and a remarkably potent strategy for gene silencing-based therapeutics [16, 17]. Compared to other gene silencing reagents, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs), ribozymes, and DNAzymes, dsRNAs including siRNAs and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) have apparently become the most powerful and widely used gene silencing reagents for manipulating gene activity in mammalians [18]. There are mainly two approaches in generating active dsRNAs in mammalian cells by exogenous delivery of synthetic siRNAs [19, 20] or shRNAs [21] and endogenous vector-expressed shRNAs [22\u201325] or siRNAs formed by annealing two complementary sense and antisense RNAs [26\u201328].",

Practically, only a small number of siRNAs are capable of inducing highly effective gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner [29]. Moreover, the silencing efficiency of siRNAs is dependent on the specificity of the target sequences within a gene and can only be measured experimentally based on the inhibition of the target gene expression. In order to select functional and effective siRNAs, it is necessary to design, synthesize, and screen many distinct siRNAs, which is expensive due to the cost of chemical synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides. Several previous studies have suggested that the secondary structures of mRNA and mRNA-binding proteins might interfere with the target site accessibility for RISC; therefore, the rational design strategy for selecting effective siRNAs is not fully programmable [30\u201333]. In addition, extensive large-scale and systematic analyses of the siRNA-specific features revealed that siRNA might have sequence-specific characteristics associated with its functionality [29, 34\u201337]. Thus, these studies indicate that the efficacy of siRNA is not totally secondary structure dependent and strongly suggest that the sequence properties of siRNA may play the major and most important role in determining inhibition efficiency.",

Previously, the effective siRNAs are identified on the basis of their abilities to inhibit the expression of cognate sequences in an ectopically expressed target gene-reporter fusion chimeric mRNA [38]. The described target gene-reporter-based siRNA validation system totally depends on the availability of cDNA clones, and this may limit the high-throughput application of the method. Besides, the chimeric mRNA of target gene-reporter fusion construct may encode an impaired fusion protein that exhibits a low reporter activity, which interferes with the screening and identification of effective siRNAs. Recently, a reporter-based siRNA validation system has been published in which the validating system is constructed by fusing a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi-targeted sequence, instead of cDNA, with a reporter gene [39, 40]. However, to generate the corresponding triggering siRNA, it is necessary to have either a synthetic siRNA (or shRNA) or another synthetic DNA fragment for constructing siRNA (or shRNA) expression vector. Thus, this system is inefficient and cost intensive, especially for large-scale studies.",

Because only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed to construct both the targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression vectors, the protocols described in this chapter provide a novel system that not only greatly facilitates large-scale loss-of-function genetic screens in mammalian cells but also provides the basis for an improved approach to screen and identify the most potent siRNA for therapeutic purposes.",

A number of extremely virulent viruses including Ebola, Lassa, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1), West Nile, and smallpox viruses are highly infectious and cause extraordinarily deadly diseases [43, 44]. Furthermore, there are currently no vaccines or effective therapies available, and in particular these viruses require special containment for safe research. To develop an extremely potent RNAi-based therapeutics for these virulent viruses with safety, this reporter-based siRNA validation system could provide a simple and powerful approach for screening and identification of highly effective siRNAs directly against viral gene expression without the need of direct virus culture.",

This will largely increase the cloning efficiency to more than 75%.The siRNA validation systems described in this method are cost effective and convenient in that any annealed oligonucleotide duplexes can be simultaneously cloned into both targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression vectors.The length of duplex region for a siRNA (shRNA) is relatively flexible from 19 to 29 nt. Although increasing the length of duplex region for a relatively ineffective 19-nt siRNA (shRNA) can increase its effectiveness, increasing the length of an effective 19-nt siRNA (shRNA) may not further improve the inhibition effect.The oligonucleotides used for constructing the systems can be purchased from any local commercial suppliers without any further modification or treatment.The annealing of two complementary oligonucleotides can be efficiently carried out in 1\u00d7 T4 DNA ligase buffer, which can be obtained from any T4 DNA ligase commercial suppliers.The annealed oligonucleotide duplexes should not be phosphorylated before the ligation step, because it might result in multiple copies of insertion.Using this protocol for cloning the targeting reporter and triggering siRNA or shRNA expression cassettes is efficient and cost effective in that only four colonies are selected and screened for the positive clones containing the RNAi-targeted sequence, siRNA or shRNA expression sequence.\n",
