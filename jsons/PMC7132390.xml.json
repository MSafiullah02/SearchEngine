Patients with severe communication problems (e.g., deafness, dementia, mental retardation) were excluded from the study. Patients who also received treatment for SARS infection in other hospitals and were transferred back to UCH for follow-up were also excluded due to possible differences in hospital management and the likelihood that these patients represented a biased group with fewer complications. A total of 119 adult patients were admitted to UCH for treatment of suspected or confirmed SARS infection. All of them were offered subsequent follow-ups at UCH according to the government policy. Of these patients, 17 failed to fulfill WHO criteria for SARS infection, 4 had also received SARS infection treatment in other hospitals, 4 were of Filipino ethnicity, and 1 had a history of a cerebrovascular accident with severe dysphasia and communication problems. Of the remaining 93 eligible subjects, 2 refused to participate and 1 returned to his home country. The cohort consisted of 90 subjects, representing a response rate of 96.8%. The subjects were relatively young (mean age=41.1 years, S.D.=12.1), predominantly female (62.2%) and relatively well educated (80% had received education to the level of secondary school or above). More than two thirds (68.9%) were either cohabiting or married at the time of the SARS outbreak. However, five subjects' spouses died of SARS, and one subject divorced after the SARS outbreak. Twenty-seven (30%) subjects were HCW. Among them, nursing staff constituted 55.6% (n=15), followed by health care assistants (22.2%, n=6) and doctors (14.8%, n=4).",

The experience of SARS infection may have threatened the subject's view of the self, the world and the future. There is evidence that diminished perceived control is associated with more severe pain and functional disability [31]. However, appraisal is a dynamic process, and it may change when new dramatic health or illness-related experiences like SARS occur. Whether certain appraisal styles exacerbate the effects of stressor and whether the predominant use of each style is related to the stress process are complex issues [23]. A prospective study may help to explain the relationship between the appraisal style and the subsequent psychological response. Early intervention to enhance self efficacy in coping with these stressful events may be a potential secondary prevention strategy, a hypothesis that requires further exploration.",

Because AVN is a delayed complication of SARS treatment, it cannot be taken into account in acute-stage studies. By further comparing subjects who have recovered from PTSD with those experiencing chronic PTSD, it was shown that AVN was an important factor in slowing recovery from PTSD. A hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that residual functional disability might also be a possible mechanism hindering recovery from PTSD. This result is consistent with the findings from studies on other traumas where long-term health problems and loss of function might play an important role in maintaining PTSD [32], [33].",

The femoral head is the most commonly affected area, but other bone areas may be involved as well. AVN might affect recovery from PTSD through the following mechanisms. First, AVN has the potential to cause pain and functional impairment, which are associated with chronic PTSD as previously discussed. Second, the discovery of AVN occurred between six and nine months post-SARS, when patients started to expect improvement of physical function. The delayed and unexpected onset causes a heavy blow to the subject's locus of control system. The unclear likelihood of AVN later progressing to bone collapse may further defeat the subject's belief system of self-efficacy. Thus, AVN demonstrates that the interaction of biopsychosocial consequences might hinder recovery from PTSD. This study also illustrates that unexpected, long-lasting physical complications of SARS might affect recovery from PTSD. The careful detection of psychiatric symptoms is needed when any further physical complication is newly identified.",

While there is evidence that steroid administration may decrease the rate of PTSD [36], the cumulative steroid dosage was not found to be protective in reducing chronic PTSD in the current study. The beneficial effect of steroids, if any, may have been negated by the subsequent complications of AVN. In contrast to the association between initial viral load and poor acute physical outcome [37], there is no obvious relationship between the initial viral load and long-term PTSD. However, further immunological correlations should be addressed in future studies. This study illustrates how the predisposing experience affects the course of the traumatic event of a medical illness. The relative contributions of the acute stressors seem to diminish progressively [38].",
