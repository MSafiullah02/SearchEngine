            "text": "Detecting of MERS-coronavirus by using one-pot reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) Since 2007, green tides with the largest scale in the world have bloomed in the Yellow Sea for 10 years. We almost monitored the green tides blooming Yellow Sea ever year, and try to reveal the mechanism of green tides blooming in Yellow Sea. In every year, the green tide started in Rudong coast area, Jiangsu province in April or May, and ended along Shandong coastline in August or September. The largest covering area was about 400-600 km 2 and the largest involved area was 20000-40000 km 2 . The average growth rate of covering area for green tides was about 15% per day, and the maximum growth rate was up to about 40% per day. In 2013, the largest biomass was estimated to be 4100 kt fresh weight. With molecular identification (ITS and 5S), we found that there were four species (U. prolifera, U. compressa, U. linza and U. flexuosa) for free-floating in Jiangsu coasts, but there was only U. prolifera freefloating in Shandong coastline. It indicated that U. prolifera is powerful and resistant species. And the Type I of U. prolifera was replaced by Type II of U. prolifera totally in 2016. In lab, the special daily growth rates of green tide algae U. prolifera were 127%, 70-80% and 20-30% for baby sporelings (100-500 \u03bcm), small sporelings (3-4 cm) and adult thallus, respectively. While in field, the average and maximum special daily growth rates of green tide algae Ulva prolifera were about 15% and 45%, respectively. It indicated that U. prolifera grew very fast. For air sacs forming along thallus and branch forming underwater for U. prolifera, the free-floating patches could float from Jiangsu coast to Shandong coast for long distance transporting with seasonal winds. It indicated that U. prolifera can avoid high lights. An understanding of the impacts of ocean acidification is particularly important in coastal regions, which are critical habitats for many marine organisms highly vulnerable to reduced pH and CaCO 3 saturation. In particular, the mixing of seawater and freshwater usually worsens ocean acidification because freshwater generally has low pH and CO 3 2\u2212 concentrations. In this study, however, an opposite case is presented. We investigated ocean acidification parameters during all four seasons in Busan coastal area and found that enhancement of CaCO 3 saturation with decreasing salinity during spring and summer. It appeared that increased phytoplankton uptake of CO 2 under enhanced water column stratification (induced by freshwater input and solar radiation) decreased dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations in seawater and increased pH, resulting in an increase in CaCO 3 saturation. Aerosol, rainwater, and sea fog water samples were collected during the cruise conducted over the subarctic western North Pacific Ocean in the summer of 2008, in order to estimate dry, wet, and sea fog deposition fluxes of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen (N). During sea fog events, mean number densities of particles with diameters larger than 0.5 \u03bcm decreased by 12-78%, suggesting that particles with diameters larger than 0.5 \u03bcm could act preferentially as condensation nuclei (CN) for sea fog droplets. Mean concentrations of nitrate (NO 3 \u2212 ), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), and non sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO 4 2\u2212 ) in sea fog water were higher than those in rainwater, whereas those of ammonium (NH 4 + ) in both sea fog water and rainwater were similar. These results reveal that sea fog scavenged NO 3 \u2212 and biogenic sulfur species more efficiently than rain. Mean dry, wet, and sea fog deposition fluxes for atmospheric total inorganic N (TIN; i.e. NH 4 + + NO 3 \u2212 ) over the subarctic western North Pacific Ocean were estimated to be 4.9 \u03bcmol m \u22122 d , respectively. While NO 3 \u2212 was the dominant inorganic N species in dry and sea fog deposition, inorganic N supplied to surface waters by wet deposition was predominantly by NH 4 + . The contribution of dry, wet, and sea fog deposition to total deposition flux for TIN (46 \u03bcmol m \u22122 d \u22121 ) were 11%, 72%, and 17%, respectively, suggesting that ignoring sea fog deposition would lead to underestimate of the total influx of atmospheric inorganic N into the subarctic western North Pacific Ocean, especially in summer periods. Laver is the economically important marine crop and model organism of the intertidal zone for studying mechanisms of stress tolerance. During the process of laver genome studies, four major technical challenges have to be faced, including bacteria contamination, high GC content of nuclear DNA, high proportion of organelle DNA, and DNA contamination by polysaccharide. To solve these problems, we explored and established an integrated technical protocol for constructing the unbiased and/or long-insert sequencing libraries.",

            "text": "Then the genome of a laver species, Pyropia haitanensis, was sequenced and assembled. With the hybrid assemble method, 4,379 contigs with total of 77.8 Mb were generated. The N50 of assembled contigs was 28.8 Kb and the average GC content of the contigs was as high as 68.6%. 9,475 protein-coding genes were predicated, of which 5,516 genes were functionally annotated, with percentage of 58.2%. On average, there existed 1.5 exons in each gene. Repeats elements analysis revealed ~8.0 Mb interspersed repeats and ~3.8 Mb SSRs (51628) accounting for 10.3% and 4.9% of the assembled genome, respectively. This genome dataset may serve as a valuable resource to study the mechanisms involved in abiotic stress tolerance in intertidal seaweeds and for laver breeding as well. Although most of land plants accumulate carotenoid with both \u03b2and \u03b5-ionone rings, such as \u03b2-carotene (\u03b2,\u03b2-carotene) and lutein (\u03b2,\u03b5-carotene), red algae do not share a common carotenoid profile. For example, the simplest unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae synthesize only \u03b2-carotene and its derivative zeaxanthin, suggesting an absence of the activity for the \u03b5-ring. Among those genes for carotenoid metabolism, only a few members, such as lycopene \u03b2-cyclase (LCYB) gene from C. merolae was previously reported in the entire red algae phylum (Rhodophyta). It is almost unknown how carotenoid metabolism is operated in multicellular red algae that also have lutein as their major carotenoid components. Benefited from the Porphyra umbilicalis genome sequence project sponsored by JGI (US DOE), we cloned the genes for geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (PuGGPPS), PuLCYB and carotene \u03b2hydroxylase (PuCHYB), and functionally characterized their catalytic activities. Although these enzymes are all encoded by multiple copies of genes in higher plants, we only found a single gene for each of them in P. umbilicalis. Our phylogenetic analysis suggested that the occurrences of both PuGGPPS and PuLCYB were before the divergence of the heterokonts and the green lineage organisms, whereas that of PuCHYB1 was probably after that. Centre for Aquaculture and Environmental Research, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Canada Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the salmon genetically engineered as food in 2015, the issue of genetically modified organism (GMO) has been highlighting globally concerning food safety and environmental consequences. Recently, the Canadian government followed suit and, after carrying out a review, determined in May 20116 that the salmon does not raise concerns related to food safety. Since the early of 90s, Fisheries and Oceans Canada have accumulated successfully many scientific knowledge regarding the growth-enhanced transgenic salmon by performing various experiments. It has been confirmed that the growth-enhanced transgenic salmon has a significantly enhanced metabolism and altered life history and thus provide an excellent model for understanding biological rhythms at the molecular level. Significant opportunities exist to alter the phenotype of fish for aquaculture, industry, medicine, environmental sciences, and the pet trade. Although food safety is still main concerns to public, the issue is largely manageable. However, major challenges remain for assessment of ecological effects of transgenic fish, particularly when information is restricted to laboratory studies for species originating from large complex ecosystems. So far, reproductive containment methods (sterility) are currently highly but not completely effective. New transgenic methods on the horizon may provide effectively complete containment. Nanobodies are small recombinant antibody fragments that are produced using the coding sequence of the minimal binding domain of a camelid single-chain antibody. The size of a nanobody is about 10 times smaller than a conventional antibody, which allows it to be used in various novel antibody-based technologies. One problem often encountered in the design of immunodiagnostic tools for infectious agents is the fact that the infecting organism itself is inducing host antibodies. Hence, detection of pathogen released or secreted molecules can subsequently only be done if diagnostic antibodies can somehow be raised that are 'better' than the host antibodies, and that can outcompete the latter when immune complexes are formed. This result is very hard to obtain with conventional antibodies as they are targeting their epitopes in a similar manner as would infection-induced host antibodies do. Using nanobodies allows circumventing this issue. Indeed, as single-chain antibodies are forced to interact with their epitopes in a different way as compared to conventional VH-VL antibodies, this characteristic can be used to circumvent competition. Besides infectious diseases, a number of other malignant conditions are being targeted at our laboratory by the use of nanobodies, including tumor targeting and anti-toxin treatment.",

            "text": "Center for Biomedical Research, Ghent University Global Campus, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, Republic of Korea Trypanosoma species infect broad range of animals as well as human. These protozoan parasites are transmitted by insect vectors and in case of aquatic hosts by leeches. Wild and domestic animals serve as a diseases reservoir. Beside drug development various attempts are focusing on the development of a vaccine. Using a mouse model we have investigated the impact of trypanosome infection by Trypanosoma brucei brucei on various B cell populations and memory responses. The results show that trypanosomes (i) cause the loss of various B cell populations, (ii) disable the hosts' capacity to raise a long-lasting specific protective anti-parasite antibody response, and (iii) abrogate vaccine-induced protective response to a non-related human pathogen such as Bordetella pertussis. Various B cells stained positive for Annexin V and had increased caspase-3 enzyme activity. Elevated caspase-3 mRNA levels coincided with decreased mRNA levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and BAFF receptor (BAFF-R), indicating the onset of apoptosis. Moreover, affected B cells became unresponsive to stimulation by BCR cross-linking with anti-IgM Fab fragments. B cell maturation was abrogated by infection-induced apoptosis of transitional B cells of both the T1 and T2 populations which was not uniquely dependent on TNF-, Fas-, or prostaglandin-dependent death pathways. Results obtained from ex vivo co-cultures of living bloodstream form trypanosomes and splenocytes demonstrate that trypanosome surface coat-dependent contact with T1/2 B cells triggers their deletion. We conclude that infection-induced and possibly parasite-contact dependent deletion of transitional B cells prevents replenishment of mature B cell compartments during infection thus contributing to a loss of the host's capacity to sustain antibody responses against recurring parasites. These results call for detailed studies of the effect of trypanosomes on B cell memory recall responses in humans and animals, prior to the planning of any mass vaccination campaign in endemic areas.",

In this study, we have developed an efficient strategy to isolate CTCs from the blood of breast cancer patients using a microfluidic immune-affinity approach. Additionally, to gain further access to these rare cells for downstream characterization, our strategy allows for easy detachment of the captured CTCs from the substrate without compromising cell viability, enabling further molecular analysis and ex vivo cell culture. To achieve this, a chemical ligandexchange reaction was engineered to release cells attached to a gold nanoparticle coating bound to the surface of a herringbone microfluidic chip (NP-HB CTC-Chip). As compared to the use of the unmodified HB CTC-Chip, our approach provides several advantages, including enhanced capture efficiency and recovery of isolated CTCs.",

            "text": "Department of Chemistry, Gangneung, Republic of Korea Thin films comprised of proteins have been used for a variety of applications such as lithographic resists, food packaging, drug delivery, and tissue engineering. Proteins are attractive precursors to manufacture augmented surfaces due to their aqueous process ability and minimal environmental impact. Protein films provide an inherently biocompatible and sustainable platform for the generation of functional materials. Maintaining film stability under aqueous conditions is crucial for successful implementation in biological applications. However, current protein based films are limited to using specific structural proteins or require the addition of harmful additives such as crosslinking agents. We describe a generalized nanoimprint lithography (NIL) based method for the fabrication of stable, patterned protein films. The NIL process involves the physical deformation of a thin film deposited on a substrate using a rigid mold precisely controlling the temperature and pressure applied. Parametric variation of processing conditions revealed that films have tunable biodegradability, are stable to cell culture conditions, and promote selective cellular adhesion. Furthermore, by imprinting with patterned molds, the films directed cell growth along nanoscale features. This generalized method is amenable to a wide variety of proteins and expands the toolkit to create patterned, functional materials from the previously underused library of available proteins. For disease diagnosis and monitoring, circulating molecules in body fluids are promising biomarkers to evaluate personal status. They can reflect the expression level of the genes and proteins in tissues, which are changed in various pathological conditions. The molecules adopted as circulating biomarker are including proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, and exosomal contents released from tissues. In this presentation, the deregulation of circulating miRNAs in aged animals and their application to reverse-aging are reported. Delivery of specific miRNAs to target tissues was performed using the circulatory system, to modulate cellular pathways related to aging process in tissues. Tissue-specific in vivo transfection of miRNAs enabled the modulation of aging biomarkers in liver. The results indicated that the genes such as Mre11a, p16INK4a, and Mtor exhibited a reversed expression in the liver. In addition, isolated exosomes from whole blood was also transfected to the tissues in aged mice, to induce reverse-expression of aging-related molecules. As for another type of circulating biomarkers, exosomes are important to convey signals to other cells and serve as a reservoir of enriched biomarkers. In this presentation, the biocompatibility of nanomaterials in human cells is evaluated by the analysis of exosomal contents. In order to comprehensively evaluate the toxicity of nanomaterials, we analyzed the exosomes secreted from human cells, which were released during cellular stress. The results showed that there was obvious intensification of miRNA expression signals in the exosomes compared with that of the parent cells, which suggested that exosomal biomarkers could be detected more sensitively than those of whole cellular extracts. S12 Occupational and environmental Issues in the Future; focus on rare earths Kyung-Taek Rim Chemicals Toxicity Research Bureau, Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHRI, KOSHA) Daejeon 34122, Republic of Korea For correspondence: rim3249@gmail.com REEs are a group of metals comprised of yttrium, scandium and fourteen lanthanide elements, which have been called 'industrial vitamins' and a 'treasury' of novel materials due to their dominant role in technical progress and in the development of traditional industries. Rare earth elements (REEs) are gaining ubiquitous importance in modern technology and have been touted as the \"sauce of high-tech industries.\" They help technologies perform better and have their own unique characteristics. Many hightechnology industries depend heavily on these unique elements for the manufacture of permanent magnets and batteries, which are vital to efficient military and green technologies, such as wind turbines and hybrid engines, as well as in smartphones and laptops. Despite the growing interest, information that has become available over the last two decades regarding RREs is relatively premature and scarce, and there are many environmental and health issues associated the production, processing, and utilization of REEs. This report offers the impacts of REE exposure to cells, animals, and plants, in order to explain disease and occupational poisoning of local residents, water pollution, and farmland destruction as well as evaluation of the occupational health hazards of REEs, recent trends in occupational toxicology and efforts to promote occupational health, along with prospects of industrial toxicology in REE-exposed workers. Conversely, a body of evidence has shown REE-associated antioxidant effects in the treatment of many diseases. It is important to review the toxicological studies to improve the current understanding of REE compounds in the field of occupational health. It will also help to establish a sustainable, safe, and healthy working environment for REE industries. 9 th ICoEHS (International Conference on Environmental Health Sciences) -2016 Abstracts S27 10.1007/s13530-016-0286-9 Y1 Transcriptomic analysis in an antidepressant exposed Hydra",

Y2 Comparing the acute sensitivity of growth and photosynthetic endpoints in three Lemna species exposed to four herbicides A study on the potential of nineteen marine algal seaweed species as biostimulant was conducted using radish seeds. Different concentrations (0%, 0.01%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%) of seaweed extracts were added and plant growth was observed over a period of 12 days. Effect of algal extracts on radish was found to depend on both the species of seaweed and their concentration. Among nineteen species of algal extracts, only three species with lower concentration showed biostimulatory effects on growth and development of radish. Concentrations of algal extracts with a biostimulatory effect ranged from 0.01% to 0.1%. This article provides a comprehendsive data of the effect of algal extracts on radish growth and development with an emphasis on the use of these environmentally friendly biosources in sustainable agricultural systems. We previously found that Cd induces inflammatory response, ER stress, and apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cell line by modulating a set of genes. Thus, in this study, we asked if Cd induces similar set of genes and inflammatory responses in alveolar epithelial progenitor type II (AETII) cells derived from human PSCs using optimized stepwise protocols. We generated AETII cells derived from hiPSCs based on sequential induction protocol and characterized their phenotypes and functional markers. AETII cells were treated with varying concentrations of Cd (1, 5, and 10 \u03bcM) for 24 hrs and we evaluated the morphological changes and inflammatory responses by Cd exposure in AETII cells compared with BEAS-2B cells. This study showed that AETII cells exposed to Cd exhibits lower release of inflammatory cytokines compared to BEAS-2B cells, suggesting that AETII cells may have some effective protective mechanisms (anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptotic) against toxic materials such as heavy metals. This work provides a good example of how hiPSC-derived AETII cells can be used for toxicity screening. Further study will be needed to optimize and standardize the toxicity screening platform using hiPSC-derived AETII cells. This platform will provide more efficient and precise tool to evaluate biologically harmful effects of various toxic materials included in microdust and smoke. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play significant roles in recognizing the pathogen-associated molecular patterns that induce innate immunity, and subsequently, acquired immunity. In general, TLRs have two downstream signaling pathways, the myeloid differential factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent and toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\uf062 (TRIF)-dependent pathways, which lead to the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\uf06bB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). 1-[5-methoxy-2-(2-nitrovinyl)phenyl]pyrrolidine (MNP) has been previously synthesized in our laboratory. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of MNP, its effect on signal transduction via the TLR signaling pathways was examined. MNP was shown to inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 induced by TLR agonists, as well as to inhibit the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and interferon inducible protein-10. MNP also inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 induced by the overexpression of downstream signaling components of the MyD88or TRIF-dependent signaling pathways. These results suggest that MNP can modulate MyD88-and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways of TLRs, leading to decreased inflammatory gene expression. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial molecules that are widely presented by pathogens and initiate innate immune system. TLR signaling is divided into two different signaling pathways, the myeloid differential factor 88 (MyD88)-and Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-\uf062 (TRIF)-dependent pathways. Eupatorium makinoi, a plant species in Asteraceae, is used for medicinal purposes in China, Korea, and Japan. Through our previous research, we found that an ethanol extract of E. makinoi (EEM) suppresses inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. In this study, we investigated the effect of EEM on TLRs signaling pathways. EEM suppresses NF-\uf06bB activation and iNOS and COX-2 expressions induced by TLR2 or TLR4 agonists. Also, EEM suppresses the activation of IRF3 induced by TLR3 or TLR4 agonists. All results indicate that EEM suppresses MyD88-and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways of TLRs and the expressions of target genes derived from the activation of TLRs. Inflammation is a pathological process that is known to be involved in numerous diseases. Microbial infection or tissue injury activates inflamematory responses, resulting in the induction of proinflammatory proteins including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Aster yomena is used in traditional Korean remedies to treat cough, asthma, and insect bites. Here, we investigated the effects of A. yomena extract (EAY) on the expression of COX-2 and iNOS induced by LPS. EAY inhibited LPS-induced NF-\uf06bB activetion and COX-2 and iNOS expression. These results suggest that EAY has the potential to be developed as a potent anti-inflammatory drug.",

In this measurement system, sensors are attached to existing mattresses and floor surfaces beneath the subjects. The level of pain was evaluated using pain score tools (VAS, FPRS, IPT). We measured five time points (before body placement and 1, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after body placement) and five body points (head, both shoulders [BoS], both arms [BoA], abdomen, both legs [BoL]) while placed in the static, prone position. There were no significant differences found in body pressure between floor and mattress placement. However, the pain score values for the arm and abdomen were significantly higher in the floor group compared to the mattress group. In addition, pain score values increased with time for the mattress and floor groups. These results suggest that the properties of time, posture, and environment need to be carefully considered when applying physical rehabilitation.",

The metabolic and physiological changes will be predicted and discussed after considering the functional aspects of these DEGs. In this study, we analyzed a series of biochemically responsive systems of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas to predict potential mode of action of antifouling agents (i.e. tributyltin (TBT), diuron, and irgarol) after exposure to different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, and 1 \u03bcg/L) for 96 h. As a result, the three antifouling biocides strongly induced antioxidant defense system. TBT reduced both enzymatic activity and mRNA expression of Na + /K + -ATPase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Diuron inhibited Na + /K + -ATPase activity and AChE mRNA expression, while irgarol treatment reduced only the transcriptional expression of AChE gene. We also analyzed transcript profile of heat shock protein (Hsp) superfamily in same experimental conditions. All antifouling biocides tested in this study significantly modulated mRNA expression of Hsp superfamily with strong induction of Hsp70 family and reduction of total hemocytes. Taken together, overall results indicate that representative organotin TBT and alternatives have potential hazardous effects on the gill of C. gigas within relatively short time period. To understand the potential effect of temperature change on the whole transcriptome of tolerant and susceptible Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, we compared whole mRNA profiles of the tolerant and susceptible oysters after exposure to 32\u00b0C for 72 h. RNA-seq and subsequent bioinformatics application revealed differentially expressed stress responsive Gene Ontology (GO) term and related transcripts following heat shock. As a result, clearest patterns were observed between tolerant and susceptible oysters with dramatic differences in transcriptional profiles of the whole heat shock protein (Hsp) gene family. GO term and transcripts typically involved in the oxygen binding activity were also repressed in the susceptible oysters compared to that of tolerant oysters. Thus, our results suggest insights into the significant differences in molecular response of tolerant and susceptible oyster to heat stress and the results will be helpful to understand a basis of molecular adaptation in C. gigas.",

In this study, toxic effect of NP was investigated in the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma embryos and novel insights into their toxicities are provided. NP treatment (200-1000 \u00b5g/L) during post fertilization led to inhibition of the hatching rate in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure to waterborne NP induced oxidative stress and dysfunction of antioxidant defense system, which ultimately led to induction of apoptotic cellular death. Of hatched larvae, the survival rate was decreased as the exposure concentrations increasing via persistent effects of NP on larval survival. Our study provides evidences of cellular stress induction and toxicity by NP treatment in the marine medaka embryos. It is estimated that plastics of 300 million tons were produced in 2013 globally and 10% of produced ones enter the ocean. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the largest produced plastics. By natural weathering, inert plastic can be broken down to smaller particles and further release some single molecules that makes up the backbone chain of inert plastic. The representative backbone-molecules of PS are styrene oligomers (SOs) including styrene-monomers, -dimers, and -trimers. Thus, these SOs might be a quantitative indicator to trace PS pollution. Furthermore, these SOs are known to be endocrine disruptting chemicals. Recent studies have showed ubiquitous distribution of SOs in coastal and open-ocean, and suggested the possibility of reaching from PS debris deposited on beach sediment. Considering the small portion of plastic debris entering the marine environment, however we infer that significant amounts of SOs originate from the terrestrial products/wastes rather than marine plastic debris. This study aimed to confirm the terrestrial source of SOs and to estimate riverine burden of SOs. For that, influents and effluents of four municipal wastewater treatment plants (m-WWTPs) and neighboring surface river waters were investigated. Total SOs concentrations were the highest in influents (266\u00b164.2 ng/L), followed by effluents (10.7\u00b14.74 ng/L) and river water (5.63\u00b13.80 ng/L). Furthermore, change of composition pattern was remarkable from influent (e.g., contribution of SD-2 was 97% of total SOs) to effluent and river water (44%). This indicates the m-WWTPs as a potential source. Further study will be performed to calculate the mass balance in m-WWTP including sorption/deposition to sludge as a removal process.",

            "text": "It is known that about 10% of plastic waste produced enter the ocean and 60-80% of plastic debris found in marine environment originate from the land. As a consequence of study results, a big gap was found between the amounts entering the ocean and found in the global oceanic water. Sinking of plastic debris to bedsediment can be suggested as one of plausible explanation. Not only plastics having higher density than that of water can normally deposit to the sediment but also even lower-density plastics may move below the water column due to the change in its physical property caused by weathering. Recent studies have shown the presence of micro-sized plastic particles (microplastics < 5 mm) in freshwater and marine bed-sediment. Identifying and quantifying the transfer of plastic from water column to bed-sediment is of importance in the sustainability of benthic ecosystem as well as in solving the uncertainty in mass balance of plastic debris. However, data of sedimentary microplastics is still scarce in the relevant field as methodology to separate microplastics from natural particles in the sediment has not been well established. In this study, we tried to develop the analytical method to separate and measure microplastics in sediment in terms of identification and quantification. As a pilot study, we tested the recovery efficiency of fragmented plastic particles which were spiked to pretreated clean sediment. In a procedure developed, we applied ZnCl2 solution to float plastic particles with a wide range of densities (0.9 to 1.3 g/cm 3 ) and gained good recoveries as for various plastics. Various microplastics were found with abundance of 0.22 particles/g ww in brackish sediment by newly developed method. This was compared with the result of that polyethylene alone was found when NaCl solution was used for density separation. This method is still in improvement for detection of microplastics with various shapes. Plastic pollution in the marine/ocean is a global concern because their micro-sized plastics (MPs) can be transferred into marine foodweb through ingestion by organisms in various trophic levels and hazardous additives can be released into surrounding environment. So far, most of MP studies has focused on marine system and freshwater system has been rarely studies. Considering that most of plastic debris found in marine environment originate from the land and MP amount found in marine environment was too small than estimate for discharge from land to ocean, significant amounts of plastic debris is inferred to stay in the freshwater system. Particularly, wastewater treatment plant (WWTPs) in urban area can be a significant source and sinker because wastes produced from human activities are treated through drainage system. This study aimed to develop the analytical method for MPs in wastewaters and to screen the distribution characteristics of MPs in WWTP system. In this pilot study, two WWTPs with different treatment process (A2O/MBR vs. MLE) were investigated. Various shapes and polymers were observed with average total abundance of ~0.2 particles/L in effluents. Major polymer was different for two WWTPs: polyurethane vs. polyethylene.",

As results, Cd and Cu induce alteration of gene expression and SOD activity. These findings suggest that Cd and Cu can induce oxidative stress in E. crassus. This study would be helpful to understand molecular mechanisms of Cd and Cu-induced oxidative stress in E. crassus. ACN9 plays an essential role in the assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and glyconeogenesis that is located in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space. Our previous results showed that ACN9 (chromosome 7q21) is a potential candidate gene for COPD and identified significant interaction with smoking based on genetic studies. However, it has not studied yet the role of ACN9 on the inflammatory response that is a key pathogenic factor for the above COPD. Here, we demonstrate that the cadmium (Cd) induced glycolytic switch and inflammatory response is significantly attenuated in ACN9 silencing bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). We firstly checked the anatomical distribution of ACN9 mRNA by in situ hybridization. Interestingly ACN9 mRNA localizes in lymphoid and bronchial epithelial cells of human lung tissues. In response to Cd, ACN9 silencing BEAS-2B cells do not produce excess succinate, or PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase), a key regulator of mitochondrial activity. We further attested the effect of ACN9 on intracellular mechanism to Cd induce pro-inflammatory cytokines in BEAS-2B cells. Consequently, ACN9 silencing significantly increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mRNA and translational level when BEAS-2B cells were co-treated with Cd via NF-\u03baB pathway. Thus, we suggested that ACN9 is a key molecule of inflammatory response, as a candidate to increase the development of pulmonary diseases.",

Melanin, a complex pigment derived from L-tyrosine, is produced by melanocytes, which are located primarily in the skin, hair bulbs, and eyes. Melanin not only determines skin and hair colors, but also plays important functions to protect skin cells from harmful effects of UV radiation. Therefore, stimulation of melanin synthesis can contribute to natural defenses of skin against the harmful effects of UV and also to improvement of disorders associated with hypopigmentation in skin and hair. Umbelliferone (7hydroxycoumarin) is a bioactive molecule present in edible fruits such as a bitter orange and regarded as the parent compound of the more complex coumarins. Umbelliferone stimulated differentiation of B16F10 cells and also increased melanin content and tyrosinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Umbelliferone increased the expression of tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related proteins, the enzymes in melanogenesis pathway, and also the expression of microphthalmiaassociated transcription factor (MITF), the transcription factor known to stimulate malanogenic genes. Our results suggest that umbelliferone can be used for the treatment of hypopigmentation-related disorders by inducing the expression of melanogenic genes via MITF stimulation. 9 th ICoEHS (International Conference on Environmental Health Sciences) -2016 Abstracts S41 P31 Gene expression profiling of human placenta cell line (JEG3) exposed to particulate matter (PM)2.5 Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5) is a common cause of several respiratory diseases. Recent studies have shown that PM2.5 can affect not only the respiratory system but also the immune system, CNS, and cardiovascular system. In particular, several epidemiological studies have reported that PM2.5 is connected with female reproductive disorders such as miscarriages, preterm births and unhealthy birth outcomes. In the present study, in order to evaluate adverse health effects of PM2.5 on the female reproductive system, we used gene expression profiling and gene ontology (GO) analysis of human placenta cell line (JEG3) to identify gene expression changes after exposed to two different PM2.5 collected from ambient air and underground parking lot. Once completed, we identified 1,021 commonly expressed genes involved in immune responses, cell-cell signaling, the regulation of apoptosis and the regulation of programmed cell death-which are known to induce adverse health effects. In addition, we identified genes related with progesterone synthesis and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. We suggest that these genes might play roles in PM2.5-induced female reproductive disorders and can help elucidate the adverse health effects mechanism of PM2.5 exposure. A number of studies have shown associations between exposure to fine-particulate air pollution and increased mortality, particularly from respiratory disease, but fewer studies have examined the association between exposure to fine-particulate air pollution and other diseases such as metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, mental illness and non-respiratory organ cancers. Also, hardly any have mentioned the regional, varied effects of particulate matter (PM). We collected particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) samples from two different sites (ambient air and an underground parking lot) and conducted an MTT assay to find the regional, varied effects of PM2.5. After the MTT assay, we chose two cell lines. One showed high cytotoxicity to PM2.5 collected from the ambient air (MCF7), the other showed high cytotoxicity to PM2.5 collected from the underground parking lot. Then, we conducted RNA-seq for gene expression profiling and gene ontology (GO) analysis. MCF7 exposed to ambient PM2.5 shows differently expressed genes involved in regulation of proliferation, immune response, cell-cell signaling etc. Meanwhile, EA.hy926 exposed to underground parking lot PM2.5 shows differently expressed genes involved in cell adhesion, biological adhesion and intracellular signaling cascade. These results may help elucidate the regional, varied effects of PM2.5 and associations among several diseases. Low-molecular-weight saturated aliphatic aldehydes (LSAAs) are categorized as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are common air pollutants and could induce the diverse adverse human health effects. In particular, an increased risk of pulmonary adverse effect has been linked to exposure to environmental chemicals including VOCs associated with environmental lung diseases such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we investigated the critical biomarkers of seven aldehydes (propanal, butanal, pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, octanal and nonanal) associated NSCLC based on transcriptome analysis. First, we investigated the mRNA expression of seven aldehydes-exposed to A549 cell and NSCLC tissues. Following mRNA expression profiling, we performed the integrated analysis of transcriptome profiling data using in vitro system and NSCLC tissues. These core biomarkers of aldehydes associated with NSCLC, environmental lung disease, provide a valuable correlation parameter of exposure to aldehydes and environmental disease associated with pulmonary toxicity. Further validation studies are necessary to develop the implication of such biomarkers for risk assessments. Epigenetics is essential for a wide range of biological processes including regulation of gene expression, normal development and cellular differentiation. All of epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of environmental diseases and cancers. As a result, there has been a steady increase the DNA methylome studies investigating the effect of human health risk factors including environmental chemicals and in relation to disease. Therefore, DNA methylation based biomarkers are also rapidly developing. Here, we present the integrative epigenetic biomarkers of aldehydes, common air pollutants, and primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues using DNA methylome analysis. We investigated the epigenomewide DNA methylome analyses in aldehydes-exposed A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells and primary NSCLC tissues to identify the relationship of exposure to aldehydes and risk of environmental pulmonary disease such as NSCLC. These core biomarkers underlying the linkages between aldehydes and environmental lung disease provide the important insights into the toxicological mechanisms and potential diagnosis of related lung diseases exposure to aldehydes.",

Here, we aimed to investigate whether exposure to low-molecular-weight saturated aliphatic aldehydes had potential adverse impacts on human respiratory system in regard to environmental lung disease including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on microRNA microarray analysis. Using microarray analysis, we identified seven aldehydes (propanal, butanal, pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, octanal and nonanal)-characterized miRNA and primary human NSCLC tissues (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma)-specific miRNAs. By integrating the analysis of the in vitro and NSCLC tissues' miRNA expression profiles, we identified the critical biomarkers reflecting the associations between environmental chemical/aldehydes exposure and pulmonary diseases such as NSCLC. Our findings provide insight into the adverse effects of aldehydes on pulmonary toxicity and possibility of pathogenesis of lung diseases.

Manila clams are mostly produced in Chungnam province (West Sea of Korea), and its annual production during the same period was approximately 14,000 tons. In this study, we evaluated the nutrient bioextraction capacity of these shellfish species in different seasons and different locations in Korea. Crassostrea gigas was collected from Tae An and Seo San, Chungnam in January and March, 2016, and from Tong Young, Gyeongnam, monthly from February to July, 2016. Venerupis philippinarum was collected from Tae An and Seo San in January and March, 2016. After the residue on the oyster and clam shells were removed, the samples were dried and then ground into powder for tissue nitrogen analysis. Both species did not show any seasonal variations in terms of the tissue nitrogen content. The oysters from Tong Young had on average 0.9% of tissue nitrogen content, while the tissue nitrogen content of the oysters from Tae An and Seo San was 0.42% and 0.47%, on average, respectively. This result suggests that V. philippinarum had a higher nitrogen removal capacity per unit weight than C. gigas. However, considering the production of shellfish in Korea, Pacific oysters removed over 1,300 tons of nitrogen during August, 2015 through July, 2016, while Manila clams removed 270 tons of nitrogen.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a key transcription factor involved in broad spectrum of toxicities in vertebrates by regulation of multiple target genes including cytochrome P450. Recent studies of AHR revealed this protein plays important role in carcinogenesis, regulation of cell cycle, T-cell differentiation and immune system via endogenous ligands such as tryptophan derivate. The apex predator in the Arctic, polar bear (Ursus maritimus), is a vulnerable species from exposure to HAHs due to biomagnification of high levels of HAHs through the food web. Several studies have indicated large species differences in AHR-mediated responses in mammals. Hence, the functional characterization of polar bear AHR signaling is of interest, as this would help to unveil the susceptibility of AHR to HAHs, and further to assess the risks. In the present study, we initially isolated AHR from polar bear cDNA. The clone encodes 793 amino acids including basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains. Seven key amino acid residues (293T, 295H, 259F, 326Y, 329I, 355F and 385A) of the ligand binding domain (LBD) in polar bear AHR (pbAHR) were conserved, which are critical sites for determining the sensitivity to TCDD were conserved as C57BL/6 mouse AHR. And we conducted pbAHR dependent reporter-gene assay using mouse CYP1A1 promoter for the risk assessment of polar bear. EC50 value of pbAHR to TCDD was 1.330 nM which was more insensitive than C3H mouse AHR (0.1230 nM). Moreover, basal level of pbAHR was so high that insufficient fold induction was shown at high concentration of TCDD. Thus we conducted same experiment with two types of chimeric pbAHR (1. cpAHR which combined N-terminus of c3hAHR and Cterminus 2. pcAHR which combined N-terminus of pbAHR and Cterminus of c3hAHR) whether the structure of pbAHR would be responsible to high basal level. The result showed that N-terminus of pbAHR indued the high basal level of pbAHR. However, further study should be followed to prove accurate character of pbAHR.",

The maximum growth rate was 6.21% d -1 in both IMTA and control sites in July. However, the sea cucumbers showed negative growth during the month of August when the water temperature reached 30\u00b0C (-1.73 (IMTA) and -2.17% d -1 (control), respectively). The tissue nitrogen content of sea cucumbers was on average 6.45% at IMTA and 6.53% at the control site.

The sea cucumbers appeared to release nitrogen into the ecosystem in August but started to remove POMs again from September. The estimate of nitrogen removal in September was 1.04 kg N at the IMTA site and 2.02 kg N at the control site This result indicates that an introduction of the deposit feeder, A.

However, the CTAB bilayer non-covalently coated onto GNRs is toxic to biological cells and dynamically unstable. In this research, the robust formation of GNRs in aqueous media is achieved initially by exchanging CTAB with (11-Mercaptoundecyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium (TMA) ligands which are more biocompatible than CTAB. To further expand their functionality and potential use, an additional step for phase transfer from water to hexane was performed through electrostatic assembly of positively charged TMA ions with negative oleate ions, enabling to be organic-soluble. Interestingly, the electrostatic assembly between the TMA and oleate ions can be easily disrupted by HCl treatment that removes the oleate ions onto GNRs to return the positively charged TMA-GNRs or by ligand-exchanging with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) to achieve the negatively charged MUA-GNRs in which both GNRs are soluble in aqueous media again.

Seaweed aquaculture performs as a promising nutrient management tool in the coastal environment by removing nutrients from the aquatic environment. In this study, we evaluated the bioextraction capacity of seaweed aquaculture in Korea. Seaweed species including Undaria pinnatifida, Saccharina japonica and Pyropia yezoensis were collected from five seaweed farms in Korea (Kijang, Busan; Dangmok and Jangyong-ri, Wando, and Yeosu, Jeonnam; Seosan, Chungnam) during the harvest season (March-April, 2016). These three species occupies more than 97% of total seaweed production in Korea (Undaria, 283,707 ton; Saccharina, 372,311 ton; and Pyropia, 397,841 ton). The tissue carbon contents of these seaweeds were 24.28-30.52% (Undaria), 20.04-25.43% (Saccharina), and 34.84% (Pyropia), respectively. The average tissue nitrogen contents were 2.18-2.82% (Undaria), 1.97-2.33% (Saccharina) and 5.87% (Pyropia), respectively. Based on the tissue carbon and nitrogen contents along with the production information, it was estimated that approximately 40,000 tons of carbon and 5,000 tons of nitrogen were removed by seaweed aquaculture in Korea during 2013-2014 growing season. This result suggests that seaweed aquaculture can efficiently remove nutrients and help improve the water quality in the marine environments. Lead is a representative heavy metal used in the manufacture of various products. Humans are exposed to lead through their daily and occupational environment. Diverse occupational usage of lead causes long-term and low dose exposure to humans. Although several studies have investigated lead toxicity in the kidneys, leadinduced genotoxicity is poorly studied in the in vivo system of kidney. In this study, we identified the molecular mechanism for biological changes and suggest the possibility of biomarkers through a molecular mechanism under lead exposure. We detected a significant lead-induced genotoxic effect in the kidneys using the comet assay following long term and low dose exposure in vivo. Furthermore, we investigated the signaling networks between lead-induced genotoxicity and the differential expression of the identified genes using a toxicogenomic approach. We identified 4 representative genes which were key in the lead-induced signaling networks. Through the result of our study, we suggest a biomarker of long-term and low level lead exposure, as well as potential biological pathways induced by lead exposure in the kidneys. Our toxicogenomic study reveals biomarkers for the understanding of lead toxicity evaluation in the kidneys, and will be utilized in further studies on the mechanism of lead toxicity in the kidneys.

Pb absorbed through the gastrointestinal and respiratory system flows through the bloodstream and accumulates in the brain, bone and liver. Especially, the liver is well known as an important organ for detoxification, and a number of prior studies have confirmed the alteration of diverse biological mechanisms caused by long-term Pb exposure in the liver. In this study, we investigated the genotoxic potential of Pb on nuclear DNA and repair capacity using comet and AP endonuclease activity assay, respectively in rat liver tissue at long-term and low-level exposure. Significant extent of DNA break damages and the impairments of enzymatic repair activities were observed in the Pb exposed group, in comparison to the control group. In addition, using integrative toxicogenomic approach we comprehensively analyzed the Pb-induced gene alteration in genome-wide scale and DNA excision repair-focused biological networks using microarray and pathway analysis, respectively. Based on integrative approach, we suggest that genotoxic effects of low-level Pb exposure are, in part, involved in the enhancement of DNA strand break and impairment of repair activity, with complex molecular signaling pathways. Our study provides perspective on novel biomarker responsible for Pb-induced hepatotoxicity at longterm and low-dose exposure, which would be useful for further development of gene-targeted therapeutic strategies and/or natural chemo-preventive agents for effective reduction of the Pb toxicity in both occupational and environmental perspectives. The exact mechanism of genotoxicity in liver exposed to low-level Pb will be further warranted.

Airborne fungi are known as representative bioaerosol in indoor environment. It causes asthma, rhinitis, sinusitis, atopy, pneumonia, sick building syndrome etc. Especially, the relationship between indoor airborne fungi and respiratory disease was reported by several research workers. When children in the level of immunity are exposed by indoor airborne fungi, they easily get asthma. Thus, monitoring the risk of exposure to allergenic fungi and the development of preventive measures to safeguard public health, requires methods that can accurately identify airborne fungi and the method could be easily followed. Therefore, importance about indoor biological harmful factor is increasing, and characterization of these species is absolutely necessary. In this study, we have investigated the distribution of indoor airborne fungi in kindergarten and postpartum care centers using PCR analysis with primers designed from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions.",

Limited evidence has been available for the relations between diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and oxidative stress markers in prenatal and postnatal environment. Urines were collected from a total of 287 mother-baby pairs repeatedly at specific time points. We measured urinary levels of two DEHP metabolites, mono-(2-ethyl-5hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and two oxidative stress markers, free cortisol and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and then estimated the relations between DEHP metabolites and oxidative stress markers using mixed effect model after adjustment for sex of infant, urine collection time, and smoking status of mother. We also calculated the risk for increase of oxidative stress markers by DEHP metabolites using GLIMMIX model after adjustment for smoking status of mother with sex of infant and urine collection time as random effects. DEHP exposure was associated with increase of oxidative stress markers (free cortisol, \u03b2 = 0.22, p < 0.0001, and 8-OHdG, \u03b2 = 0.23, p < 0.0001). Risk for increase of oxidative stress markers by DEHP exposure was found to be 1.99 for free cortisol (OR = 1.99, p = 0.0019) and 1.60 for 8-OHdG (OR = 1.60, p = 0.0327). Our findings suggest that DEHP exposure may induce oxidative stress in prenatal and postnatal environments.",

Here, we evaluated the bioremediation ability of Pacific oysters and blue mussels in the IMTA system in Tongyeong, Gyeongnam, Korea. The growth rate of oysters was approximately 5.70% d -1 during the months of May and June. The growth rate was then decreased to 2.97% d -1 in July. The average tissue nitrogen contents of oysters and mussels were 0.84 and 2.14%, respectively. The nitrogen removal of oysters increased mgN\u00b7gDW -1 \u00b7d -1 during the months of June and July. From May to July, 2016, oysters and mussels removed over 730 and 970 kg\u00b7ha -1 of nitrogen, respectively from the IMTA system. Our results indicate that mussels have a high nutrient bioextraction capacity than oysters. Coastal macroalgal habitat have important roles in the shallow water systems with anthropogenic CO 2 regulations. There are many concern about dynamics of inorganic carbon species in the seawater along the ocean acidity increased consistently, thus many research is more focused on algal ecophysiology in response to ocean acidification. Among ecophysiological studies, evaluation of carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) has been considered as important to forecast the responses of marine macroalgae to ocean acidification, but data are still insufficient. This study was conducted with estimation of CO 2 and HCO 3 use strategies of 9 macroalgal species using photosynthesis measurement. Photosynthesis of various macroalgal species showed wide range of apparent half-saturation constant for CO 2 and HCO 3 -. Notably, photosynthesis of Ulva pertusa and Prionitis cornea are undersaturated under ambient HCO 3 concentration, thus these species will be positively affected by ocean acidification due to elevated HCO 3 -. Also, most species have higher values of apparent half-saturation constant for CO 2 , and this indicate that they could derive benefit for CO 2 utilization under elevated CO 2 . Understanding these species-specific carbon use strategies might allow us to forecast ecophysiological changes in macroalgal communities in a high CO 2 world.",

Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis were cultured at 5, 10, 15 and 30 psu of VSE medium for 7 days and various photosynthetic parameters were measured directly. The photosynthetic efficiency of G. lemaneiformis was measured as the ratio of variable to maximum quantum yield (F v /F m ) as well as maximum electron transport rate (ETR max ). Values of ETR max were minimal (14.96) and maximal (30.13) in the samples grown under 5 psu and 30 psu, respectively. In the case of Fv/Fm values, no significant difference was noted between the different salinity treatments except for 5 psu. These results indicate that G. lemaneiformis had similar capacity for light capture and use the light energy at salinities higher than 5 psu, but maximal photosynthetic production at 30 psu. Comparative sensitivity of different life stages of Spirodela polyrhiza exposed to paraquatTo determine the toxic effects of paraquat on the aquatic plant Spirodela polyrhiza, EC 50 and CV in each life stage of S. polyrhiza (3 days old, 4 weeks old and mature plants; 8 weeks old) were measured. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurement techniques were used to investigate the effects of herbicides on the photosynthetic efficiency of S. polyrhiza. The effective quantum yield of PSII was measured by F v /F m after 3 days of exposure to the toxicant. The toxicity rank based on EC 50 was as follows: 3 days old (0.757 \u00b5g L ) > 8 weeks old (2.291 \u00b5g L -1 ). On the other hand, EC 50 values of root length exposed to paraquat were 0.722 (0.645-0.788), 2.140 (1.368-3.061) and 5.533 (3.654-10.293) \u00b5g L -1 , respectively. 3 days-old S. polyrhiza plants were found to be most sensitive to paraquat. Chl a fluorescence may be one of the most sensitive parameter and may provide useful information for the toxicity risk assessment of residual herbicides in the aquatic ecosystem.

However, the commercial applications of the nanoparticles have been developed rapidly by a lack of toxicology data. In particular, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have gained antimicrobial properties. Due to the properties, AgNPs are have been used in numerous commercial products. Therefore, they may pose a risk for humans and the environment. In this study, the toxicity of AgNPs and silver ions on fungi, Fusarium oxysporum, Beauveria bassiana and Lecanicillium psalliota, were evaluated. We have synthesized silver nanoparticles using sodium citrate as reducing agent, and three fungi were isolated from indoor air of public facilities. Physicochemical properties of AgNPs are shown by dynamic light scattering (DLS), Zeta-potential, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Atopic dermatitis (AD) is pruritic inflammatory skin disease that is observed frequently in children and even in adults. Its pathogenesis has been reported by genetic background, environmental factor, immunologic abnormalities, or skin barrier dysfunction. However, it is not clear. In immunologically, chronic AD patients have increased IL-5, IL-12, and interferon-gamma mRNA-expression levels. These show that AD is Th-2 type immune response. Furthermore, AD causes the skin barrier dysfunction. Pyropia yezoensis is a marine red algae, which has various bioactive materials, such as MAA (mycosporin-like amino acid). This extract is known to possess antiaging activity against UV-induced skin cell damages and antioxidant. In this study, the analysis of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) gene expression level was performed to examine effects of the Pyropia yezoensis extract on the Th2-type chemokines.",

Responses of Th2-type chemokine genes were depends on the concentration of extract. In conclusion, this research indicated that the anti-atopic activity of Pyropia yezoensis extract was appeared on the cellular and molecular levels. Through further study, the precise mechanism will be elucidated by analyzing of the inflammation induction in this cell model. The ways for screening the ultraviolet light has been used with chemical and mineral methods. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ), zinc oxide (ZnO), or both nanoparticles are used as a mineral sunscreen. Emulsifying agents commonly used in sunscreen are compounds including isopropyl alcohol, acidic buffer, alkali or alkali metal carbonate. These additives can be affected the penetration of nanoparticles into the skin cells or the cellular responses by physico-chemical interaction with both compounds. In this study, to evaluate the effects of some additives on the toxicity of nanoparticles (TiO 2 or ZnO) composing of the sunscreen, we conducted MTT assay to human keratinocytes, HaCaT cell line. Three additives for comparison study were selected to cyclopentasiloxane and jojoba ester commonly used in sunscreen and lecithin known to have less toxicity. First, from the results of the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles on HaCaT cell, TiO 2 was almost no toxicity, while ZnO treated group and both nanoparticles treated group were increased the cytotoxicity dependent to concentration. As a result by additives, lecithin is less cytotoxic than cyclopentasiloxane and jojoba ester, and when using lecithin as the emulsifier showed a tendency to decrease the toxicity. Therefore, our result suggests that the lecithin is safer emulsifier than cyclopentasiloxane and jojoba ester in sunscreen including nanoparticles. Long term exposure to trace amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is associated with various diseases, such as respiratory system and central nervous system disorders. Current biomonitoring methods using urinary biomarkers have been known to timeconsuming and technically challenging. So, the identification of more precise and specific biomarkers is necessary, for this purpose, we investigated plasma proteins from workers exposed to toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene using antibody array. The expression profiles of protein were different between each VOCs exposed and unexposed groups. Commonly expressed proteins by three VOCs were 16 proteins and these proteins are associated with cell proliferation, regulation of body fluidic levels, lymphocyte activation, peptidyl tyrosine phosphorylation, and etc. Among these proteins, PF4 protein was up-regulated and CD40 and IL-23p19 protein were down-regulated. And functional study on differentially expressed proteins by each VOCs was represented that biological processes including regulation of apoptosis, phosphorylation and cell migration were similar in three VOCs exposed groups. So, proteins related to these function are expected to function as biomarkers for monitoring of exposure to VOCs. Further research is required to confirm the specificity and reliability of these protein biomarkers on many of VOCs exposed workers. Cigarette smoke has been implicated as risk factors for vascular diseases. Crotonaldehyde, one of the major compound of cigarette smoke, is a highly reactive alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde and a product of endogenous lipid peroxidation. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is predominant in modulating the intracellular redox homeostasis. In this study, we showed that TrxR1 induction in response to low concentration of crotonaldehyde and evaluated the signaling pathways involved in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Also, inhibition of TrxR1 activity significantly increased the death rate of crotonaldehyde-exposed cells. In brief, these results demonstrate that the activation of TrxR1-p38 MAPK-Nrf2 axis defines a new mechanism for the adaptive response to crotonaldehyde in human endothelial cells. \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde is toxic compounds that is found in combustion of tobacco, wood and produced endogenously by lipid peroxidation. Crotonaldehyde (CRA) is one of the reactive aldehydes. It makes DNA adducts inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and increase apoptotic cell death via regulating intracellular calcium and p53 signaling pathway, which causes endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs and controls gene expression through repressing of target mRNAs. miRNA regulates many cellular function including apoptosis, development, and proliferation. Toxicant such as CRA exposure changes miRNA expression causing cellular stress, and can affect many vascular disease. In this study, we demonstrate that analysis of miRNAs in CRA stimulated human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found 162 miRNAs were differentially expressed in CRA-treated endothelial cells and performed anticorrelations between miRNAs and mRNAs. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on specifically expressed miRNAs indicated significant enrichment in biological functions. Our findings support the view that CRA-treated changes in gene expression make for the improvement of cardiovascular diseases. Accumulating evidence indicates that insulin resistance (IR) is closely related to white adipose tissue, but the underling mechanisms of IR pathogenesis are not fully understood. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of IR expression microarray datasets by integrating 7 datasets in human subcutaneous adipose tissue, and identified 1413 (842 up-and 571 down-regulated) genes (i.e., meta-signatures). Cross-species analysis using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that the meta-signatures were significantly enriched in not only in vivo and in vitro IR model studies, but pharmacogenomics and gain-and loss-of-function studies for attenuating IR in overall white adipose tissue. Among meta-signatures, 211 drug-signatures (133 up-and 78 down-regulated genes) were identified using microarray datasets of human IR patients treated with thiazolidinedione and IR mouse model treated with metformin, and expression levels of 195 drug-signatures (92%) were significantly correlated with homeostatic model assessment 2 of insulin resistance and body mass index. Finally, network analysis showed that 19 genes (degree > 9) were identified and confirmed by real-time qPCR. These findings suggest that our results provide a robust genetic markers and potential therapeutic targets of IR.",

PCBs can be categorized into two structural group, coplanar and non-coplanar PCBs, depending on the number and position of chlorine. In particular, the coplanar PCBs are known as dioxin-like as well as potent toxicity compounds. In this study, the two types of coplanar PCBs, PCB77 and PCB126, were chosen for data analysis to evaluate their effects on human health. We performed meta-analysis through R GeneMeta/DOSE package, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The datasets including 45 samples of microarrays contained 359 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 117 genes of these DEGs were associated with muscular diseases. The important feature of coplanar PCBs referred to as dioxin-like is caused by binding to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Although studies involved in PCBs and heart diseases as well as AhR have been ongoing for many years, this is the first metaanalysis showing the correlation between coplanar PCBs and muscular disease thereby heart diseases. We show that metaanalysis data which support the hypothesis that coplanar PCBs can generate human heart diseases related to AhR.

Identifying the genetic contributions to ovarian cancer will lead to advances in diagnosis and therapy. Here we analyzed SNPs through genotyping in Korean serous ovarian cancer patients at stage IIIc for the purpose of applying a pathway analysisbased approach using candidate loci. The results of statistical analysis based on the Korean HapMap showed that a total of 759 SNPs had significant differences in ovarian cancer. Our biological pathway analysis included the comparison of all SNPs with SNPs of serous ovarian cancer patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify the molecular pathway in Korean serous ovarian cancer. The results suggest that genetic alterations associated with these signaling pathways might contribute to the discovery of unique biomarkers for diagnostic predictor of Korean serous ovarian cancer at stage IIIc.

Daphnia magna (D. magna), a type of water flea, inhabits in water and is recommended by OECD guideline as aquatic model to test toxicity of chemicals. Through acute immobilization test, we observed a mobility change of D. magna caused by cadmium chloride exposure. The EC 50 value of cadmium chloride was 14.5 ppb. Using D. magna exposed to cadmium chloride at EC 50 Concentration, we conducted microarray analysis to investigate differential gene expression and found 247 up-and 146 down-regulated genes. We performed BLAST analysis to identify and understand the meaning of the microarray data in comparative genomics. Comparing common proteins in some species, potential biomarkers and functions are discovered through pathway analysis. Based on differential gene expression of cadmium-treated D. magna, potential biomarkers are identified. Additionally, they are investigated by functional network of mammals including human through comparative genomic analysis. By discovering these potential biomarkers, it is possible to improve prediction of cadmium exposure in aquatic environment. As public interest in safety has increased the toxicity evaluation of chemicals become more important. In this study, the DNA-damaging effect of genotoxicants was examined in HepG2 cell line originated from human hepatocellular carcinoma by widely used genotoxicity assays: the comet assay and gamma-H2AX immunostaining. Four different direct/indirect genotoxicants were tested in dose-/timedependent manner. The comet assay and the gamma-H2AX immunestaining enables detection of DNA damages in the form of DNA strand breaks with different sensitivity. Therefore, the combination of comet assay and gamma-H2AX immunostaining will be complementary tool for evaluation of various forms and degree of DNA damage. Our result also suggested that HepG2 cells could be a suitable model for assessing the genotoxicity of various mutagens and for determining the lowest genotoxic concentration. Further analysis using a larger number of chemicals is warranted to determine the sensitivity and the specificity of HepG2 with in vitro genotoxicity test. With the increasing advancement of industries, environmental pollution has become conspicuous on a global scale. At this point, the requirements of the variety of systems for an early risk assessment and studies of the environmental problems for the making of such systems have been proceeding around the world. In recent decades, a number of studies have sought to evaluate the environmental risk of toxicants such as VOCs, and a variety of techniques like the microarray have been correspondingly employed; however, a dearth of the studies that evaluate the effects of such toxins with the use of an in vivo analysis still exists. For this study, the three toxicants TOL, EBZ, and XYL were selected from among the VOCs, and the mRNA-expression levels with methylation-expression levels were compared with those of the control samples to ensure reliability and to check the effects of the epigenetics. First, the mRNA-expression levels for each chemical were analyzed, so the 275 mRNAs in the TOL exposure, the 485 mRNAs in the EBZ exposure, and the 141 mRNAs in the XYL exposure were obtained as results. With these genes, the attainment of the candidate biomarkers of the 66 genes in the TOL exposure, 148 genes in the EBZ exposure, and 43 genes in the XYL exposure was achieved with a methylation analysis. These biomarkers confirmed that the sample group was divided well into the exposed group and the control group in classification analysis. This integrated data-analysis approach and the selected biomarkers could represent a promising way to study the environmental risk assessment of VOCs.",

A. in Mendelian Inheritance in Man 12th Edn (John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1998).Acknowledgements: Acknowledgements are brief and follow the reference list. Authors are encouraged to include a statement to specify the contributions of each coauthor. Acknowledgements contain grant or contribution numbers, but do not contain thanks to anonymous referees and editors, or effusive comments.Tables: Table should each be presented on a separate page, portrait (not landscape) orientation, and upright on the page, not sideways. Tables have a short, one-line title in bold text. Upright roman (not bold or italic) type of the same size as the rest of the text is used. The body of the table should not contain horizontal or vertical rules; these will be added by ToxEHS when necessary after the paper has been accepted for publication. Tables should be as small as possible. Bear in mind the size of a ToxEHS page as a limiting factor when compiling a table and ensure it will reduce appropriately. Symbols and abbreviations are defined immediately below the table, followed by essential descriptive material as briefly as possible, all in double-spaced text. The preferred format for regular tables is Microsoft Word; however, WordPerfect and Acrobat PDF are also acceptable. Note that a straight Excel file is not currently an acceptable format. Excel files must be either embedded in a Word or WordPerfect document or converted to PDF before being uploaded. For contributions with methods section, legends should not contain any details of methods, or exceed 100 words (fewer than 500 words in total for the whole paper). In contributions without methods sections, legends should be fewer than 300 words (800 words or fewer in total for the whole paper).",
