We previously demonstrated that three fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and 30 difloxacin, suppress replication of six flaviviruses. To investigate the barrier to resistance and 31 mechanism(s) of action of these drugs, DENV-4 was passaged in triplicate in HEK-293 cells in 32 the presence or absence of each drug. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected by the seventh 33 passage and to difloxacin by the tenth, whereas resistance to enoxacin did not occur within ten 34 passages. Two putative resistance-conferring mutations were detected in the envelope gene of 35 ciprofloxacin and difloxacin-resistant DENV-4. In the absence of ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin-36 resistant viruses sustained a significantly higher viral titer than control viruses in HEK-293 and 37 HuH-7 cells and resistant viruses were more stable than control viruses at 37\u02daC. These results 38 suggest that the mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin and difloxacin involves interference with 39 virus binding or entry. 40",

Moreover, cross-resistance to structurally 64 related drugs can occur and must be investigated as cross-resistance can render an entire class of 65 antivirals ineffective (10,11). The utility of an antiviral also depends on the barriers to resistance 66 (11)(12)(13)(14). A drug that imposes a high genetic barrier for the evolution of resistance is more useful 67 than a drug that allows for evolution of resistance to occur within a few passages or within a 68 single host infection (13,15). RNA viruses have been shown to evolve drug resistance via one of 69 4 two mechanisms: (i) specific antagonism of drug action, which often results in a decrease in 70 fitness in the absence of the drug (9,16-21) or (ii) a general increase in fitness, which can 71 sometimes be sustained following withdrawal of the drug (21,22). A decrease in fitness of 72 resistant viruses could negatively impact viral transmission and alleviate disease burden, while a 73 gain in fitness could exacerbate disease and could increase transmission, although these two 74 phenotypes may also be uncoupled by evolution of drug resistance. 75",

(6) recently 78 reported that enoxacin suppresses ZIKV in human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) and suggested 79 the efficacy was due to enhancement of RNAi. Second, multiple fluoroquinolones have been 80 shown to suppress hepatitis C virus (HCV), possibly by interfering with the viral helicase 81 (26,27). Third, ciprofloxacin inhibits cellular helicases (28), which are targeted and bound by 82 the flavivirus capsid protein (29) and the untranslated regions (30,31) to regulate viral replication 83 and aid in virion assembly. Fourth, ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin prevent cellular apoptosis 84 (32,33), a process that flaviviruses suppress early in infection by activating the 85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (34), but activate later in infection with the capsid, NS2A, 86 and NS3 protease proteins (35-37). Fifth, ciprofloxacin suppresses autophagy (32). The loss of 87 autophagy results in non-infectious virions and a decrease in viral RNA production during 88 DENV infection (38). Lastly, the fluoroquinolone levofloxacin inhibits rhinovirus replication by 89 reducing expression of the cellular receptor required for viral entry (39). Any one of these 90 mechanisms, or combinations thereof, may be responsible for the efficacy of fluoroquinolones to 91 suppress flaviviruses. There may also be functions of fluoroquinolones that have not been 92 5 described in the literature that contribute to their anti-flaviviral efficacy. The location of 93 mutations specific to fluoroquinolone-resistant viruses can suggest possible mechanisms-of-94 actions. 95",

We hypothesized that: (i) the barrier to resistance 97 against fluoroquinolones would be low and that, therefore, resistance would evolve within ten 98 passages in cultured cells, (ii) resistance to one fluoroquinolone would confer cross-resistance to 99 other fluoroquinolones due to the high structural similarity of these drugs, and (iii) resistance 100 would evolve via specific evasion of the drug, resulting in a decrease in fitness in the absence of 101 the drug. To test these hypotheses, we serially passaged DENV-4 in triplicate in the presence or 102 absence of fluoroquinolones, in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293).

We predicted that ciprofloxacin-resistant and control 105 lineages of DENV-4 would share common mutations relative to the parent DENV-4 that confer 106 adaptation to HEK-293 cells (40), but that ciprofloxacin-resistant lineages would also possess a 107 unique constellation of mutations, some conferring fluoroquinolone-resistance, and that these 108 latter mutations would provide insight into the fluoroquinolone mechanism-of-action (41-50). 109",

In sum, these studies seek to move 119 the evaluation of FDA-approved drugs for antiviral repurposing beyond the demonstration of 120 efficacy to consider the consequences of resistance. 121 122",

Treatment of both media-passaged virus and ciprofloxacin-passaged 321 virus with 39.4\u00b5M ciprofloxacin (2x the EC50) resulted in a significant decrease in titer for both 322 virus lineages relative to treatment with media (Tukey pairwise comparisons, P < 0.05), but the 323 decrease in viral titer of the media-control viruses after ciprofloxacin treatment was greater than 324 that of the ciprofloxacin-passaged viruses (4.2 log decrease vs 1.9 log decrease). There was no 325 significant difference in mean viral titers between the media-passaged viruses treated with media 326 and the ciprofloxacin-passaged viruses treated with ciprofloxacin (Tukey pairwise comparison, P 327 < 0.05).

However, after difloxacin treatment, the ciprofloxacin-resistant DENV-4 replicated to 407 the same level as the media control viruses treated with media. Viral replication after treatment 408 with enoxacin remained 14x lower than the media control viruses treated with media, a highly 409 significant difference (t = -4.3, df = 4. P = 0.01). viral lineage and treatment in the resistance test was not significant (two-way ANOVA F (2,12) 412 = 0.8, P = 0.48; Figure 6b ). The mean viral titer for the viruses passaged with media and tested 413 against media were almost 100-fold higher than the mean viral titer for the difloxacin-resistant 414 viruses tested with enoxacin, indicating that enoxacin still suppresses replication of DENV-4 that 415 is resistant to difloxacin (Tukey pairwise comparison, P < 0.05). Yet, the mean viral titer of the 416 difloxacin-resistant viruses tested with ciprofloxacin was not different from the media-passaged 417 viruses treated with media demonstrating that DENV-4 resistance to difloxacin can result in 418 cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin Tukey pairwise comparison, P > 0.05).

Of the infected mosquitoes that fed on 468 bloodmeals spiked with parent virus, 45% of the heads were also infected with an average titer of 469 2.69 log10PFU/head (Table 3) We recently demonstrated the efficacy of three fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin, 475 difloxacin and enoxacin, against a panel of flaviviruses in cultured cells and A129 mice (5). In 476 the current study, we investigated the barrier to evolution of resistance and cross-resistance to 477 these drugs, their mechanisms-of-action, and the fitness consequences of resistance.

E417A was also detected in one replicate of the difloxacin-resistant 504 viruses, but neither mutation was detected in the enoxacin-passaged viruses. Ciprofloxacin-505 resistant viruses were sequenced by Illumina while difloxacin-resistant and enoxacin-passaged 506 viruses were analyzed via Sanger sequencing, thus it is possible that the mutations detected in the 507 ciprofloxacin-resistant lineages occurred in these two groups at frequencies below the level of 508 detection. Also, resistance to difloxacin was not as complete as resistance to ciprofloxacin, as 509 resistance was confirmed at the EC50 (10.1\u00b5M), but not at 2x EC50 (20. conditions, viral titers of ciprofloxacin-resistant viruses were greater than those of the media 566 control viruses in HEK-293 and HuH-7 cells.

Intriguingly, 568 replication of the three virus lineages were indistinguishable in Vero cells, a cell line that lacks 569 an interferon response (92,93).

Upon acidification of the endosome, 511 genome release is initiated when domain II folds out at the hinge point located between domain I 512 and II, forming contact points with the cellular vesicle (69). V15L occurred in the envelope 513 protein in domain I, a b-barrel that organizes two envelope proteins into a dimer (69), while 514 E417A occurred in domain III. The conservative change of valine to leucine at amino acid 515 position 15 is unlikely to cause a major change in protein structure, and indeed DENV serotypes 516 1 and 3 possess a leucine at this position. However, replacement of a negatively charged 517 glutamic acid at amino acid with a hydrophobic alanine could potentially shift protein structure 518 and function; all vector-borne flaviviruses analyzed possessed a negatively charged amino acid at 519 this position and none of the 13 flaviviruses analyzed possessed an alanine. Additionally, a 520 panel of 9 mutations were shared by resistant and control viruses, many of which have been 521 previously shown to enhance replication in mammalian cells (40,70-73). been suggested for the inhibition of HCV by fluoroquinolones (26). Ciprofloxacin-resistant 526 viruses also did not show increased variant frequency or genetic diversity; such an increased 527 would be expected if ciprofloxacin suppressed viral replication by enhancing RNAi (74,75). 528 Our findings do suggest that that ciprofloxacin and difloxacin antagonize virus binding or 529 entry. Fluoroquinolones are produced as a byproduct during chloroquine synthesis and share 530 similarities in structure (Figure 1) (76), and the action of chloroquine may offer a clue about how 531 ciprofloxacin and difloxacin could affect DENV entry. Chloroquine has been shown to suppress 532 multiple viruses including DENV, ZIKV, chikungunya virus, and poliovirus (77-84) likely by 533 blocking endosome acidification and thereby inhibiting virus entry (79,82,85,86). Interest in 534 chloroquine as an antiviral recently spiked due to its potential utility against the novel 535 coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that in 2020 has caused a massive and ongoing pandemic. 536 Unpublished data suggests that like chloroquine, ciprofloxacin neutralizes the pH level within 537 the lumen of the trans-Golgi network of bronchial epithelial cells (87). As antiviral assays are 538 conducted to determine the efficacy of chloroquine to suppress coronaviruses, it would be 539 prudent to evaluate the ability of fluoroquinolones to suppress coronaviruses as well. 540 Alternatively, mutations in envelope could increase the stability of the protein and 541 thereby slow virion degradation. The envelope protein of ZIKV and the ZIKV virion as a whole 542 are more stable and infectious at high temperatures than DENV (88); this thermostability of 543 ZIKV depends on hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions in the ab helix of domain II of E (89). 544In this study, both ciprofloxacin-resistant and media control virions were dramatically more 545 stable than the parent virion, and ciprofloxacin-resistant virions were slightly more stable than 546 the media controls. Moreover, both ciprofloxacin-resistant and media control DENV-4 had higher stability than that reported for wild type ZIKV (90). Both ciprofloxacin-resistant and 548 media control share a E327G mutation in domain III of E, which is the most likely cause of their 549 enhanced stability.A\u00f1ez  et al. found that passage of DENV-4 in fetal rhesus lung (FRhL) cells 550 resulted in the same E E327G mutation, and that DENV-4 carrying this mutation exhibited an 551 increase in replication and infectivity in FRhL cells compared to its parent (73). To bind to a 552 target cell the DENV E protein interacts with heparan sulfate (91) and the E327G mutation 553 increases DENV-4 binding affinity for heparan sulfate (73). Molecular modeling further 554 predicted that the E327G mutation increased the net positive charge on the surface of the virion 555 and suggested that the mutation created a new heparan sulfate binding site (73). The increase in 556 virion stability of the ciprofloxacin-resistant and media control DENV-4 is likely due to the 557 increased positive charge on the surface of the virion. Importantly, when two rhesus macaques 558 were infected with the DENV-4 passaged in FRhL cells, neither monkey had detectable levels of 559 viremia or antibodies indicating that a glutamic acid at position 327 is favorable for monkey 560 infection even if a glycine does increase infection, replication, and heparan sulfate binding in cell 561 culture (73). 562A third possibility is that V15L and/or E417A could increase overall fitness to overcome 563 suppressive effects of ciprofloxacin. The fitness of ciprofloxacin-resistant, media-control and 564 parent viruses in the absence of the drug was assessed in four different cell lines. Under these 565",
