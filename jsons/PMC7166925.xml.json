The disease is due to infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), previously known as novel coronavirus 2012 or HCoV\u2010EMC.1, 2 Human infection is thought to follow exposure to infected camels or human\u2010to\u2010human transmission primarily in healthcare settings.

Suitable specimens for testing include lower respiratory tract samples (LRT), nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, nasal washes, and nasal aspirates. The LRT samples have been shown to contain the highest viral loads, possibly due to virus tropism for LRT cells.4, 5 Confirmation using real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT\u2010PCR) assays require a positive result for at least two different specific targets on the MERS\u2010CoV genome using a validated assay, or a positive rRT\u2010PCR result for one specific target on the MERS\u2010CoV genome plus MERS\u2010CoV sequence confirmation from a separate viral genomic target.6 Nucleic acid sequencing of an amplicon has also been recommended when there are discordant results on different assays,6, 7 confirming the specificity of the target.",

This was made up of nine specimens (A to I) of inactivated (gamma irradiation; 50 kGy) MERS\u2010CoV, human coronavirus OC43, human coronavirus 229E, and a negative control (specimen I), as well as two synthetic specimens (J and K) containing in vitro RNA transcripts. RCPAQAP have used similar transcripts in previous PT panels, and have shown that they are safe, stable, and reliable.8 The design of these transcripts was based on the complete genome sequence of human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (GenBank accession number: JX869059.2). The following five regions of the MERS\u2010CoV genome were included in the two synthetic specimens: a 385\u2010nucleotide region upstream of the E protein gene (upE) covering nucleotides 27 312 to 27 696; 500 nucleotides of the open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) starting at nucleotide 10 923; a 502\u2010nucleotide region of the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) starting at nucleotide 18 054, as well as two regions; one from the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) starting at nucleotide 14 994 and another from the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene starting at nucleotide 29 523, with a length of 392 and 491 nucleotides, respectively. The five RNA transcripts were designed to yield positive results in RT\u2010PCR assays that were originally published by Corman et al,6, 7 which formed the basis of the \u201cWHO interim guidance\u2014laboratory testing for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.\u201d8 Specimen J contained all five RNA transcripts, whilst specimen K contained a single transcript covering upE.

Following gamma irradiation of the viruses, inactivation was confirmed and viral RNA was quantified using real\u2010time PCR.8 The relative measure of the concentration of virus\u2010specific target was determined by generating standard curves using a set of MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific and HCoV\u2010specific primers to quantify the genome equivalents (GE) copies per millilitre of each specimen.6, 7 Three external referee laboratories confirmed sample characteristics.",

The high level of concordance between the 96 participating laboratories suggests a high global capacity to detect MERS\u2010CoV. Despite this, a small number of laboratories performed poorly and the results of this PTP identify opportunities for future improvement. Incorrect results could be attributed to three main causes: (i) cross contamination, (ii) low sensitivity of the NAT (predominantly PCR), or (iii) transcription error. A number of laboratories reported a MERS\u2010CoV false positive result for the human coronavirus samples (specimens B and C) and the negative sample (specimen I). These results were all reported with high C\nt values, suggesting cross contamination of samples. There were four participants reporting false negative results for specimen G, which contained the lowest concentration of MERS\u2010CoV. These participants consistently reported unusually high C\nt values for specimens across the panel, indicating that these laboratories had relatively low sensitivity in their PCR assay and may not have been able to detect MERS\u2010CoV at lower concentrations. This finding is similar to that of two previous external quality assessments, which reported some laboratories to have reduced assay sensitivity when assessed on a 10\u2010fold MERS\u2010CoV dilution panel.11, 12 These studies also demonstrated a high overall capacity for laboratories to detect MERS\u2010CoV in China,11 and worldwide.12 Similarly, a study performed during the 2015 Korean outbreak reported a 100% MERS\u2010CoV detection score amongst 47 participants.13 However, the panel in this study only consisted of three specimens, limiting their assessment of assay sensitivity. Both the Korean and Chinese external quality assessments differed from this PTP in that they did not include other human coronaviruses for the assessment of assay specificity. Access to and participation in future quality assurance (QA) programs will provide the opportunity for improvement at a technical level. Offering an ongoing PTP for the detection of MERS\u2010CoV and other human coronaviruses by PCR will ensure that this capacity will remain appropriate and provide continuing opportunities for improvement.",

However these results were unsurprising, as a large proportion of participants reported they had no or limited capability to test for human coronaviruses other than MERS\u2010CoV before the beginning of the PTP. The capacity to test for related organisms is important in distinguishing pathogens such as MERS\u2010CoV from genetically related, but less virulent organisms such as other human coronaviruses.",

            "text": "The two synthetic specimens containing MERS\u2010CoV complementary DNA were included in the PTP as they provided noninfectious, easily accessed, and scalable quantities of target analyte. Although these specimens were not scored, they were informative as for how participating laboratories handled equivocal test results. Specimen J contained five in vitro transcribed RNA transcripts, a design intended to give positive results for all NAT markers included in PCR protocols recommended by the WHO. Specimen K contained a single transcript covering upE, a design that challenged participants with a sample that would yield an equivocal result. Participants would only get a positive result in an initial screening assay against upE, while confirmatory tests of this initial screen would be negative. The protocol recommended by the WHO advises further specimens to be collected in the absence of a confirmatory result. The US CDC protocol recommends reporting of an equivocal result and contacting the CDC for consultation. In the context of this PTP, the expected result for specimen K would have been \u201cnot specified\u201d and a comment as for equivocal results and/or the necessity to collect and test a second sample. Interestingly, more than half of the participating laboratories reported the presence of MERS\u2010CoV in specimen K despite the fact that confirmatory NAT assays against targets other than upE were negative. Additionally, a small number of laboratories were found to be only performing an average of one PCR assay per sample. These results highlight the need for laboratories to follow a NAT regimen with at least two independent assays. Laboratories need to have detailed guidelines for MERS\u2010CoV PCR test interpretation as well as reporting instructions. By addressing these issues, it is anticipated that the global laboratory capacity for MERS\u2010CoV detection will be enhanced.",

            "text": "Engaging international laboratories, especially those in countries with limited exposure to routine QA proved to be one of the major challenges in organizing and executing this PTP. Language barriers, limited resources, skepticism toward an unknown organization, as well as the need for laboratories to continue their routine testing alongside PTP sample testing most likely contributed to difficulties with engagement. Jurisdictional difficulties with specimen handling were also an administrative challenge. Despite the material not being infectious, several laboratories required a range of documentation such as import permits. Obtaining these documents was often time\u2010consuming, and in more than one instance required 8 weeks or longer before specimens could be received. The responses to these challenges need to include early engagement with laboratories, as much local interaction as possible with regional WHO support, and effective communication with customs and courier officials to avoid delays at the dispatch stage of the PTP. The strong support from the WHO regional offices was key to successfully running the PTP in 96 laboratories from 79 countries. Contracting three different courier services ensured efficient distribution of the PTP globally, with 85% of laboratories receiving the panel within 5 days of dispatch.",

The PTP identified improvement opportunities at a technical level, including (i) the need for performance of confirmatory NAT assays, (ii) avoidance of cross contamination of samples, and (iii) care with clear identification of the particular coronavirus target and result. Laboratories need access to QA programs, and continued encouragement for engaging in these QA activities, which are in addition to, but important for their diagnostic functions. Facilitating involvement of laboratories in appropriate QA programs is essential to continuing accurate detection of pathogens. Accurate diagnosis is critical where a pathogen is infrequently seen, and detection may have significant community, public health, and social implications. Continuing involvement in well\u2010regulated QA programs, attention to technical details, and staff development can avoid significant laboratory error and unnecessary public health concern.",
