This results in a petiole\u2010like structure of mixed stem\u2013 petiole nature supporting both the leaf and the flower (or inflorescence), located on the lamina (Weberling, 1989: 217\u2013218).",

The \u2018fertile\u2019 branch was the plant's terminal internode before a sympodial shoot developed.2In P. kjellii, P. palmiriensis, P. phyllanthopsis, and P. reptilis, a serial axillary bud develops abaxially of the axillary bud, from which develops the sympodial shoot that ensures a growth in length of the plant. In a later stage, a bract, being the outer part of the serial axillary bud, may be seen in the axil between the sympodial shoot and the petiole. Because the bract is positioned at the side of the petiole and opposite to the side of the \u2018fertile\u2019 branch, it clearly indicates which of the opposed structures is the petiole and which is the \u2018fertile\u2019 branch (Fig. 1A). In P. pachystachya and P. paradoxa, the bract's position is more lateral to the axillary bud and can hardly be used to make this distinction.3The petiolar and internodal ribs of P. reptilis clearly show the difference between the petiole and the \u2018fertile\u2019 branch. In this species, the petioles are characterized by three ribs: one at the abaxial side running down from the mid\u2010nerve of the leaf blade and two lateral ones running down from the two lateral nerves of the leaf blade. The internodes of P. reptilis, by contrast, are characterized by two ribs running down from the lateral ribs of the petiole and crossing the node. The occurrence of two ribs on the \u2018fertile\u2019 branch clearly proves that it is of stem nature.4Sometimes, a sessile leaf does not only \u2018subtend\u2019 an inflorescence, but also a complete leafy branch, indicating that the \u2018fertile\u2019 branch is just the basal internode of that branch. This has been observed in P. palmiriensis (holotype) (Fig. 2) and P. foliiflora (Allard 21574, NY; Mathias 5356, MO).\n5In some species (for example, P. foliiflora and P. pinoi), petioles are usually distinctly shorter than \u2018fertile\u2019 branches and may be distinguished in this way.\n",

Each new fertile branch, consisting of one internode, one \u2018fertile\u2019 leaf, and an inflorescence, originates from the axil of the previous one. This branching pattern gives this group its typical appearance: a simple stem, with a terminal cluster of \u2018fertile\u2019 branches (Fig. 1B). \u2018Vegetative\u2019 leaves are reduced and are present as a single bract opposed to their corresponding \u2018fertile\u2019 branch. Their opposite position may become less obvious when new \u2018fertile branches\u2019 develop from their axil. In the schematic presentation of Figure 1B, the 1\u2032\u22127\u2032 distance is elongated to elucidate the architecture. In reality, that area has a more condensed aspect. One or more normal \u2018vegetative\u2019 leaves may develop before the development of the first \u2018fertile\u2019 branch. They are usually smaller than \u2018fertile\u2019 leaves and are less cordate. They may persist at the base of the cluster of \u2018fertile\u2019 branches. However, this is rarely observed, and most specimens seem to have only \u2018fertile\u2019 leaves. In some species, the main stem may bear one or a few \u2018vegetative\u2019 branches with a similar architecture, i.e. with a terminal cluster of \u2018fertile\u2019 branches.

We follow Trelease in distinguishing the species, but for different reasons. Thorough examination of the types clearly shows that both taxa have the same kind of indumentum. Both species show condensed lateral \u2018fertile\u2019 branches. However, P. phyllantha shows one or more \u2018vegetative\u2019 lateral branches, by contrast with the simple main stem in P. foliiflora. The \u2018fertile\u2019 branches of P. phyllantha have the same length as the leaves, whereas, in P. foliiflora, the branches are considerably longer than the leaves. In addition, the leaves of P. phyllantha are distinctly elliptical, whereas those of P. foliiflora are ovate. The basal leaf lobes in P. phyllantha usually overlap, whereas these of P. foliiflora do not. Peperomia foliiflora exhibits ellipsoid 1 mm long drupes, whereas those of P. phyllantha are (sub)globose and shorter. The differences are sufficiently distinct to keep both taxa separated.",

This opposite leaf position is a misinterpretation of some branches as petioles. Indeed, \u2018fertile\u2019 branches are of the same size as the petiole of the opposite \u2018vegetative\u2019 leaf, resulting in apparently opposite (thus pseudo\u2010opposite) leaves. Where two leaves seem to be opposite, only one of them is a \u2018vegetative\u2019 leaf, whereas the other is a sessile leaf on top of a short branch. There is a distinct difference between the petiole and the \u2018fertile\u2019 branch where they originate from the main stem. The petiole \u2018clasps\u2019 the node to some extent, the lateral margins of the petiole crossing the node and continuing downwards into two internodal ribs. This is not the case with the \u2018fertile\u2019 branch. The location of a small bract, part of a serial axillary bud, also indicates which of the two opposed structures is the branch and which is the petiole. The bract is located at the side of the petiole and opposed to the side of the branch. The pseudo\u2010opposite position of two \u2018fertile\u2019 leaves, as depicted on the splendid colour plate of this plant made by Pedro Alvincula de Almanza during the Mutis expedition (Iconografia Mutisiana plate nr. 695 \u2013 MA), does not occur in P. phyllanthopsis and is an idealization of the artist not familiar with the particular branch\u2013petiole issue in this taxon (Fig. 8).
