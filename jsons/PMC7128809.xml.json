Particularly in recent years, yet to be fully understood changes in the environment, increased movement of goods and persons, and the local influence of global warming and other phenomena concerning vectors and hosts, seem to have promoted and accelerated changes in the presentation of old infectious diseases and the development of new ones [1, 2, 3]. The relevance of the \u2018emerging and re-emerging\u2019 infectious diseases, usually defined as \u2018infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range\u2019, is further noted by the WHO in its recent World Health Report 2007 [4]. The WHO stressed that infectious diseases are spreading faster and emerging more quickly than ever before.",

Experts in microbiology (especially virology), public health, epidemiology, infectious diseases, and communication need to work together to respond to such incidents. For HIDs in particular, because of the rarity of their occurrence, strong collaboration and exchange of data, and attention to lessons learned from previous episodes, are advisable. For these reasons, creating new networks and enhancing those functioning well should be strongly promoted, in order to:\n1ensure a rapid and effective response to health threats deriving from natural infection by or deliberate release of HID agents;2stimulate complementarity and prevent duplication;3promote international cooperation, exchange of experience, good practice and protocols;4support the less prepared countries in the European Community.\n",

The development and refinement of new diagnostic tests, new therapeutics and innovative vaccines is mandatory as never before. The use of networking and international partnership could represent the successful strategy in this context. The traditional boundaries between basic science and clinical medicine should be dropped, and through effective networks the few HID events that occur worldwide should be studied thoroughly. A network of top-quality scientists and clinicians will provide the complementarity required for the development of these new approaches. Moreover, improved funding for research on HIDs could come from the involvement of networks in the private sector, which could be encouraged to invest in this area because of the epidemic potential and the possible large-scale economic consequences.",

Several differences exist among European countries, due to government policies, as well as to pre-existing conditions, and these may result in delayed and dissimilar public health interventions and non-standardized training programmes. A better coordination of public health approaches to HIDs may lead to standardization of interventions and protocols, such as the prompt isolation within structures with adequate technical and logistic features, to the development of a common core-curriculum, and substantial improvement in the application of international health regulations. Moreover, from a practical perspective, a network involving the main public health institutes may play a key role in the management of:\n1a returning HID patient travelling through more than one country (e.g. in the case of one or more connecting flights), in order to coordinate public health interventions;2an HID patient admitted in a country without adequate healthcare settings for isolation (in this case, a cross-border transport by ground or air may be the most appropriate solution);3multi-country outbreaks.\n",

Moreover, among the critical points identified in the context of the laboratory diagnosis of HID agents are the scarcity of biological samples to validate the diagnostic methods and the fact that few commercial diagnostic tests are available for these pathogens. Thus, a well-functioning network is essential for:\n1the sharing of diagnostic and research experience of the currently operating BSL-4 European laboratories, as well as diagnostic protocols, samples, reagents, and personnel for training;2the review of current laboratory diagnostic capability for HID agents;3the development of new hazard-free diagnostic tests suitable to be transferred to other non-BSL-4 laboratories;4the standardization of procedures for biosafety and biosecurity.\n",
