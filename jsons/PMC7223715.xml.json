            "text": "Hepatitis B is a major global health issue caused by the infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic diseases1. It is estimated that 257 million people worldwide are HBV chronic carriers and have a high risk of developing liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Approximately 1 million chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients die from these late complications each year. Conventional hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) vaccination induces a protective antibody in most healthy vaccinated populations and has efficiently decreased the incidence rate of new HBV infections2. However, HBsAg fails to induce an effective antibody response in either preclinical animal models or patients with CHB infection, probably due to antigen-specific immune tolerance induced by the high load of viral antigens3. Therefore, an effective treatment strategy to eliminate and eradicate hepatitis B is highly desired.",

            "text": "Compared with HBsAg, the preS1 domain of the HBV large surface antigen has been suggested to be an ideal immunogen candidate for therapeutic vaccine development. PreS1 plays a pivotal role in HBV entry by interacting with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), identified as the cellular receptor for HBV4,5. Monoclonal antibodies against preS1 (MA18/7 and KR127) have been demonstrated to potently inhibit HBV infection in vivo and in vitro6,7. In addition, anti-preS1 can also eliminate HBV+ cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and phagocytosis8. Clinically, anti-preS1 is an early serum marker for HBV clearance9,10. All these data suggest that anti-preS1 response might be beneficial for CHB treatment. Moreover, in CHB patients, immune tolerance to preS1, if any, appears to be much lower than that to HBsAg3,11, as it only occurs in a trace amount compared with the latter in CHB patients12,13, which favours antibody response induction. In fact, we recently showed that preS1 antigen vaccination, but not HBsAg, induced a neutralizing therapeutic antibody response in HBV carrier mice11. Nonetheless, preS1 appears not to be an efficient antibody inducer compared with HBsAg. This is reflected under both natural infections and active vaccinations11,14,15. Therefore, how to improve the immunogenicity of preS1 for enhanced therapeutic antibody response is currently a key issue for preS1-based therapeutic vaccine development.",

The anti-preS1 level continued to increase in the ferritin NP\u2013preS1 immunization group and reached a peak around day 60, when an approximately 150 times higher antibody level was measured compared with the SC\u2013preS1 control vaccine group, in which the antibody level still remained low. The antibody response gradually decreased but remained detectable at day 235. Furthermore, a boost immunization elicited a much stronger antibody response in the ferritin NP\u2013preS1 group compared with the SC\u2013preS1 control group (approximately 600-fold) (Fig. 1g). The enhanced immunogenicity was also seen in the absence of CpG-1826 adjuvant (Supplementary Fig. 1a), suggesting an intrinsic feature of ferritin NPs, probably due to repeated antigen display and an NP carrier effect16. However, in the presence of CpG, the enhancement becomes more marked, suggesting a coordination between a ferritin NP intrinsic feature and an adjuvant-induced innate response.",

The SC portion itself that was fused to preS1 has no effect on the immunogenicity of SC\u2013preS1 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). The foreignness of the bacterial ferritin is also not responsible for the enhanced antibody response, as preS1 displayed by a mouse ferritin H chain generated a comparable antibody level to bacterial ferritin (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The efficient antibody response is also not restricted to mouse strains (Supplementary Fig. 1e). In addition, physically mixing preS1 antigens with ferritin NPs instead of covalent binding could not elicit a strong anti-preS1 response, suggesting the necessity of antigen display on the ferritin NPs (Fig. 1h). Thus, preS1 conjugated to ferritin NPs generally enhanced the immunogenicity of preS1 antigen and elicited an efficient antibody response.",

There is no detectable anti-preS1 response in the established HBV carrier mice, consistent with the clinical observation29,30. However, after the second boost on day 63, the ferritin NP\u2013preS1 vaccine induced a significant amount of anti-preS1, which was barely detectable in the SC\u2013preS1 group (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, preS1 antigen and HBsAg in the sera declined significantly with the induction of anti-preS1 (Fig. 3c,d). On day 147, about 10 weeks after the last immunization, serum HBV DNA was also significantly reduced in the ferritin NP\u2013preS1 group but not in the control groups (Fig. 3e). Moreover, in four out of seven mice in the ferritin NP\u2013preS1 group, serum HBV DNA dropped to undetectable levels, also showing barely detectable HBsAg and significant amounts of anti-HBs (Fig. 3e), suggesting potential for a functional cure. In addition, the HBV core antigen as detected by immunological histological chemistry staining (Fig. 3f) and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) as detected by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 3g) were also significantly diminished in the liver of the ferritin NP\u2013preS1 group. The clearance of HBV core antigen in the liver was not accompanied by liver injury (Fig. 3h).

On subcutaneous injection, ferritin NP\u2013eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) was abundantly located in the medullary regions and also but to a lesser extent in the interfollicular region (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, ferritin NP\u2013eGFP was highly colocalized with cells with SIGNR1 expression. SIGNR1 mediates the recognition of several virus particles32,33. This finding prompted us to hypothesize that ferritin NP\u2013eGFP was actively captured by SIGNR1+ cells during their passive transportation and retained in LNs. To further confirm this and examine the ferritin NP cell-targeting property in more detail, ferritin NP capture by phagocytic cells was determined by flow cytometry. Supportively, SIGNR1+ resident dendritic cells (rDCs) and migratory DCs (miDCs) (Supplementary Fig. 3a) showed significantly higher GFP immunofluorescence intensity than their SIGNR1\u2212 counterparts, indicating the preferential capture of ferritin NPs by SIGNR1+ DCs (Fig. 4b). Similarly, in non-DC cells, the SIGNR1+ population, which was mostly CD169+ macrophages, also showed preferential capture of ferritin NPs (Fig. 4c). As control, the soluble eGFP was almost undetectable in either SIGNR1+ or SIGNR1\u2212 subsets. Similar results were found when fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used to label ferritin NP\u2013preS1 or SC\u2013preS1 (Supplementary Fig. 3b\u2013d). The CpG-1826 adjuvant had no influence on these captures (Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, ferritin NPs appear to be predominantly captured by both SIGNR1+ DCs and SIGNR1+ macrophages in the draining LNs (dLNs).",

Both SIGNR1+ DCs and SIGNR1+ macrophages were efficiently depleted (Supplementary Fig. 3e). The capture of ferritin NP\u2013eGFP was almost completely lost after CLL treatment (Fig. 4d,e), suggesting an essential role of SIGNR1+ cells in ferritin NP retention. This preferential capture by SIGNR1+ APCs is not only because of their location-determined accessibility to injected ferritin NPs. In fact, in vitro coculture of digested single-cell suspensions from LNs with ferritin NPs demonstrated similar preferential capture by SIGNR1+ APCs (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting an intrinsic feature of ferritin NPs or SIGNR1+ APCs.",

On CpG immunization, a cluster of SIGNR1+ cells emerged in the follicular regions of dLNs (Fig. 6e, top panel), which express CD169 rather than CD11c, indicating their macrophage identity (Supplementary Fig. 10a). This suggested that SIGNR1+ macrophages might directly carry antigens to follicles for B cell activation. To understand how this migration is regulated, we examined the CXCL13\u2013CXCR5 axis, given the abundant expression of CXCL13 in B cell follicles and its important role for follicular migration40. In Cxcr5\u2212/\u2212 mice, no SIGNR1+ cells could be found in B cell follicles on immunization, in stark contrast to WT mice (Fig. 6e, bottom panel). In supporting these data, flow cytometric analysis showed that SIGNR1+ macrophages, but not SIGNR1\u2212 macrophages or SIGNR1+ DCs, significantly upregulated CXCR5 on immunization (Supplementary Fig. 10b). The upregulation of CXCR5 appears to be a direct effect of CpG and unique to macrophages, as CpG alone induces CXCR5 expression on isolated primary SIGNR1+ macrophages but not DCs under in vitro culture (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Given the aberrant LN organization in Cxcr5\u2212/\u2212 mice, WT:Cxcr5\u2212/\u2212 mixed bone marrow chimaeric mice were generated and confirmed the macrophage cell intrinsic role of CXCR5 on their migration to B cell follicles (Fig. 6f).",

Furthermore, some mice in the ferritin NP\u2013preS1 group showed undetectable HBsAg and HBV DNA in the sera, and more impressively these mice also showed significant amounts of anti-HBs. These data indicate that ferritin NP\u2013preS1 vaccine may be a good candidate to achieve a functional cure. Moreover, encouragingly, ferritin NP\u2013preS1 vaccine also significantly reduced HBV cccDNA in the liver. Thus, our study might provide a new strategy toward eliminating cccDNA that could be worthy of future evaluation when used either alone or in combination43.",

However, the underlying immunological mechanism is still poorly understood, which might limit its further improvement. In the current study, we have revealed that ferritin NPs are primarily captured by SIGNR1+ cells at the lymphatic zone of the dLNs, where both resident DCs and macrophages are enriched19,44,45. The ferritin-capturing DCs and macrophages play different roles in antibody response. Resident DCs appear to be the most important APCs for Tfh induction, which is also supported by the recent finding that lymphatic-sinus-associated resident DCs are strategically localized to induce rapid T cell response on particulate antigen immunization45.",

In the previous studies34,46,47, subcapsular sinus macrophages were considered immotile and the particulate antigen was speculated to be transferred to B cells via transcytosis or cytoplasmic membrane movement from the subcapsular sinus side to the other side facing the B cell follicles19,46,48. In our study, we found that SIGNR1+ macrophages, but not other macrophages or DCs, can upregulate CXCR5 on immunization and migrate to the follicular regions. When CXCR5 is lacking, antigen-loaded macrophages fail to activate B cells, which might suggest a previously unrecognized means of particulate antigen transfer by migrating SIGNR1+ macrophages. Whether CXCR5 deficiency could impair other functions of macrophages, resulting in impaired B cell activation, remains to be studied in future. It should be noted that the upregulation of CXCR5 on macrophages is dependent on CpG instead of ferritin NPs themelves. How CpG stimulation upregulates macrophage CXCR5 expression is still unknown. Whether other adjuvants have similar effects also remains to be systemically investigated. Nonetheless, ferritin NPs seem to be able to employ this machinery for enhanced antibody response.",

Data are representative results of four independent experiments. b\u2013d, WT mice (n = 5) were treated with PBS or anti-CSF1R before ferritin NP\u2013preS1 vaccine immunization. b, On day 10, preS1-specific IgM and IgG were detected; c,d, on day 21, preS1-specific IgG (c) and ASCs (d) were detected. b\u2013d show representative results of two independent experiments. e, Distribution of SIGNR1+ cells in iLNs of WT and Cxcr5\u2212/\u2212 mice on day 3 at immunization. A representative B cell follicular region is shown in magnification (top right). Data show representative results of four independent experiments. f, Microscopy of WT SIGNR1+ cell (CD45.1) or Cxcr5\u2212/\u2212 SIGNR1+ cell (CD45.2) distribution in iLNs 5 d after CpG-1826 immunization in WT:Cxcr5\u2212/\u2212 mixed bone marrow chimaeric mice. The area of total SIGNR1+ cells (red), WT SIGNR1+ cells (yellow) or Cxcr5\u2212/\u2212 SIGNR1+cells (white) within follicles (yellow dashed line) was analysed using ImageJ software. Data were pooled from n = 18 follicles from six mice in three independent experiments. Each symbol represents an individual follicle. g, SIGNR1+ macrophages were sorted from the spleen of vaccinated WT or Cxcr5\u2212/\u2212 mice, injected f.p. in naive CD45.1 mice, who had received MD4 B cells (CD45.2) the day before. 1 d later, the percentage and activation of CD45.2 MD4 B cells were analysed. Data show representative results of three independent experiments. PerCP, peridinin-chlorophyll-protein; PE, phycoerythrin. In a\u2013d and f, data are shown as mean \u00b1 s.e.m.; statistical significance was determined with an unpaired two-tailed t-test. In g, the data were analysed using a paired two-tailed t-test.
