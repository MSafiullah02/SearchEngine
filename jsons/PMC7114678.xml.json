However, efforts in pharmaceutical production have been limited mainly to those model plant species that are easily transformed such as tobacco and Arabidopsis [3], [9] Among the crop species used for production of recombinant vaccines are tomato [15], [16], [17], [18], potato [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24] and alfalfa [25], [26], [27]. Stand-alone examples also include lettuce [28] and carrot [29]. Monocot plants have also been used for production of recombinant antigens, in most cases presented in maize seeds [30] and recently reported for rice [31]. Most of these studies were done as proof-of-concept [9], [10] and it has since become clear that some plants are not suitable for this purpose. In tomato, for example, antigen expression levels in the fruits can be very low and/or vary dramatically in the pool of fruits originating from the same transgenic line [15], [16]. Our own recent experiments revealed severe degradation of recombinant protein in the ripened tomato fruits as compared to immature green fruits [18]. Potato tubers, which were once considered promising for vaccine production purposes, have shown very low levels of antigen expression and, for oral delivery, would have required heat treatment that destroys the recombinant protein [32]. In most cases reported for crops, the overall yields of recombinant proteins expression were relatively low and/or plant material was not suitable for oral administration or storage [8], [9], [10].",

Collard is a large green leafy crop that is easy to grow, survives ambient temperatures, and produces kilogram amounts of rough leaf material from a single plant. It is convenient for production of recombinant proteins in large leaf tissues using strong tissue-specific promoters and specific intracellular targeting signals. Cauliflower has an edible overgrown inflorescence (curd or head) that is also convenient for long-term storage, transportation and delivery. Like other Cruciferous vegetables, cauliflower also has proven anti-cancer bioactive sulfur-containing compounds known as glucosinolates (isothiocyanates and terpenes) [33], [34]. Both collard and cauliflower are close relatives of Arabidopsis, a well-studied plant model system [35]. Thus, advances in Arabidopsis research, especially regarding identification of suitable mutants/knockouts and specific genetic elements, will help greatly in developing the Cruciferae-based system.",

Efficient transformation procedures were developed for these species based on the nptII and bar genes as selectable markers. Use of our original procedure led to the generation of transgenic collard that express B5 recombinant vaccine candidate against smallpox at high levels with no adverse effect on its phenotype.

Most of the recombinant subunit vaccine components are of viral origin. However over-expression of large full-size viral antigens, such as rabies G-protein or SARS spike protein, appears to perturb the normal growth and development of the plants (our unpublished data). That is probably due to the induction of natural plant defense mechanism against some viral pathogens [46], [47], [48]. Our goal is to overcome this problem and develop plant expression system that is capable to produce large amounts of viral antigens.",

            "text": "Toward this goal, we consider the following steps. First, the expression cassettes used must allow the appropriate intracellular localization, folding and posttranslational modifications of the recombinant antigens, making them suitable for abundant accumulation in targeted plant cells/tissues as well as being immunologically functional. Second, the suppression of plant defense mechanisms can be examined using readily available Arabidopsis knockout/mutant plant lines with the capability for sustained high-level expression and accumulation of viral glycoproteins. Finally, for production purposes we are developing crop plants of the same Cruciferae family as the model Arabidopsis plant into an efficient transformation-production system (Fig. 5\n). Our criteria for choosing these crops include: easy scalability for production, overall consumption safety, large production biomass, long-term storage capacity, and ease of processing and delivery. It is expected that results obtained for Arabidopsis are also likely in the related plants. These steps, serve to identify a strategy for the generation of a unique plant-based system for production of large recombinant viral proteins, i.e. components of subunit vaccines, in amounts sufficient for immunization of humans and/or animals preferably via the oral and possibly via other mucosal routes [6], [15], [18], [28].",

Both species are highly sensitive to Agrobacterium, so the concentration of the agrobacterial culture used for inoculation was very important. Dilution of Agrobacterium led to a significantly reduced necrosis in explant tissues. A pre-cultivation period proved useful only for cauliflower, consistent with previous studies indicating positive results with pre-cultivation for other Cruciferous species [41], [49]. For both collard and cauliflower we were not able to regenerate transgenic shoots when selection was carried out immediately after co-cultivation. Therefore, we applied the combination of a delay period followed by low selection pressure in regeneration medium and increased selection pressure in root induction medium. This schema has proven to be very efficient and allow for fast generation of transgenic plants with total elimination of large number of escapes. This approach was efficient for both selection agents used (Km and PPT). Altogether, optimized selection and regeneration procedures for collard and cauliflower yield transgenic plants in a relatively short time of 8\u201310 weeks from the beginning of the experiment until transfer of transgenic plants to soil. Overall transformation efficiency of collard cv Morris Heading was very high (11%). For cauliflower cv Early Snowball transformation efficiency was 2.4% that is comparable with the one obtained for this recalcitrant species by other authors [reviewed in 41].",
