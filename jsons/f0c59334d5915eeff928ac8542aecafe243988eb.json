Globally, the interaction between human health and the health of the environment is increasingly recognized, along with acknowledgement that healthy ecosystems and healthy people go together [1] . 'One Health' discourse and practice integrates animal health into the equation. In this context, zoonotic diseases, emerging or re-emerging as public health problems at the people-wildlife-livestock interface, have become a major focus of scientific and policy attention. While much concern is driven by their capacity to result in global disease outbreaks, from pandemic influenzas to Ebola and Zika virus epidemics, there is growing attention to (once) neglected tropical diseases. In many parts of Africa, for instance, evidence is accumulating of the major impacts of zoonotic diseases, especially on people who are already poor [2] .",

There has been relatively less attention to the detailed local interactions between people, disease, animals and ecosystems, untangling the complex dynamics of local systems. Yet it is these local disease -ecosystem -livelihood dynamics that underlie and add up to wider patterns of change, as they interact with larger-scale drivers whether in environment, economy or demography [4] . Evidence and understanding of local system interactions is also a critical basis for informing scenarios and decision-making processes around policy, practice or institutional change geared to improving policy and practice, designing and implementing 'One Health' interventions that work in real-world settings.",

A series of case studies focused on local system contexts and interactions in relation to particular zoonotic diseases in African settings. Each asked: how do ecological changes (e.g. in biodiversity, vegetation and habitat, water) and humanecosystem interactions affect pathogen dynamics and hence the likelihood of zoonotic spillover and transmission? How do different peoples' interactions with ecosystems and animals, in the context of their daily lives, livelihoods and socio-economic activities, affect their exposure to disease? How do social differences-by gender, age, wealth, occupation-affect these interactions? What are the synergies, but also tensions and trade-offs, between ecosystem interactions that are important for livelihoods, and those that put people at risk of disease?",

These cases were chosen because, in common, the diseases all require persistent animal reservoir host(s) and zoonotic spillover to cause human disease (unlike viruses of longer zoonotic origin such as HIV/AIDS); yet they involve contrasting transmission routes, ecosystem types and environmental-livelihood dynamics, facilitating a fuller and more comparative understanding. The modes of animal-human transmission considered cover those that are direct (from bats in the case of henipavirus, rodents in the case of Lassa fever and domestic livestock in the case of RVF) and indirect, via insect vectors (mosquitoes in the case of RVF and tsetse flies in the case of trypanosomiasis). The cases also involve a range of non-human vertebrate hosts (both wild and domestic) and degrees of reliance on them. Case study sites are located across ecological zones associated with rainfall gradients and dominant vegetation types, from semi-arid savannah in Kenya, through wooded miombo savannah in Zambia and Zimbabwe and forest-savannah transition in Sierra Leone, to humid forest in Ghana (figure 1). The cases therefore enable a comparative exploration of a range of disease-ecosystem dynamics. The case studies also represent different local contexts of people-livelihood-ecosystem interaction, from a rural and urban contrast in Ghana for the henipavirus case; a village-garden-farm landscape in Sierra Leone for the Lassa case; a contrast between a dry pastoral rangeland and irrigated agriculture in Kenya for the RVF case; and an ecotone between plateau and valley, correlated with changing agricultural and wildlife dynamics in Zambia and Zimbabwe for the trypanosomiasis case.",

It then looks across them to draw out cross-cutting insights around several themes: the relationship between disease and ecosystem dynamics across space and time; interactions between differentiated livelihoods, ecosystems and disease risk; and synergies and trade-offs in using and managing ecosystems for livelihoods and disease. The analysis in turn suggests a number of implications for policy and practice. RVFv, is thus likely to provide conditions for RVFv occurrence and endemicity. In livestock, RVF causes abortions, stillbirths and the death of young animals, and so severely affects livestock productivity and herd viability, and hence pastoral livelihoods. In people, it causes a flu-like illness which can on occasion be severe or fatal. Much attention has focused on large epidemic occurrences of RVF. In contrast, low-level endemic transmission of RVF is known to be common in rural areas of semi-arid Kenya. The case study investigated how ecosystem changes linked especially to the expansion of irrigation were affecting RVF transmission, and the impacts on people and animals in the context of their interactions with these ecosystems.",

Mosquito sampling was carried out in four repeated cross-sectional surveys in irrigated and non-irrigated areas that took a period of 1 year to cover all the seasons. Mosquito larvae were also collected from all the open water bodies within the irrigation scheme and transported to the laboratory where they were reared to adults, identified and screened for viruses. Both primary and secondary vectors of RVFv, including Aedes mcintoshi, Ae. ochraceus, Ae. tricholabis and Culex pipiens, were sampled in the irrigated farms. Multivariate models fitted to the data showed that controlling for season and humidity, the irrigated farms had significantly higher densities of mosquitoes than the pastoral areas (table 1) . The study also demonstrated that drainage canals in the irrigated area supported the breeding of many mosquito species. When these mosquitoes were screened for arboviruses using standard molecular characterization techniques, eight Ndumu viruses were identified. These viruses also cause febrile illnesses in humans.",

Overall, the median percentages and the 10th and 90th percentile of households that were classified under Complementing the focus group discussions, participatory mapping was used to determine ways in which people in pastoral and irrigated areas interacted with their ecosystems as they pursued their livelihood activities. Households in the pastoral sites engaged in livestock husbandry and sale of fodder, trees, firewood and water. In the agro-pastoral sites, crop farming, livestock husbandry and charcoal burning, in that order, were identified as the key livelihood activities while in irrigated areas, livelihood activities entailed crop farming, paid employment (formal/casual), charcoal burning and the sale of firewood and water. These activities varied by wealth; in all three sites, wealthier households either had formal employment or ran profitable businesses, while those in the middle-and low-wealth categories worked as labourers in irrigated farms, herded animals for pay or fetched water, firewood, grass and building materials including poles for sale. Ecosystem interactions and livelihood activities also varied by gender. In irrigated agriculture, women were more engaged in planting and weeding, while men were mainly involved in watering and spraying of the crops against pests. In agro-pastoral and pastoral sites, there was a clear separation of the various livestock activities implemented by women, men, young boys and girls.",

Cotton production has become widespread along with other forms of cultivation with resultant changes in land cover.

However, this reduction in prevalence was due to a reduction in the species causing AAT rather than T. brucei s.l. Due to difficulties inherent in the diagnosis of the human-infective T. b. rhodesiense subspecies in animals, T. brucei s.l. is often used to investigate potential HAT infection. Therefore, the ecosystem changes appear to have been beneficial in terms of AAT, but have not reduced the risk of HAT transmission. Given that the number of livestock (and therefore the size of the potential livestock reservoir for HAT) has also increased, the risk to human health could potentially increase in the future despite the reduction in the overall trypanosomiasis prevalence. Migration patterns are complex with people often moving over short distances. Those who in-migrate and settle at the edge of intact vegetation are more likely to be exposed to the risk of infection through contact with tsetse. In particular, tsetse were primarily detected in the northwest of the study area towards the South Luangwa National Park and Lower Lupande GMA, which still largely contains woodland savannah vegetation; the growing numbers of people living in this interface area, or entering to gather fuelwood and other resources, may be at a heightened risk of contracting HAT, when compared with people living in the centre of settled areas.

Those who inhabit and visit the interface areas with woodland and wildlife-interfaces whose location is shifting as land-cover change proceeds-are particularly vulnerable. For in-migrants and others dependent on these zones, positive benefits for livelihoods and well-being from making use of woodland resources also bring the corresponding risk of disease. If tsetse persist in sufficient numbers within the interface zone, people and livestock will continue to be at risk of infection.",

Until the 1990s, the Zambezi Valley-the area between Zambia and Zimbabwe-hosted high tsetse fly populations and experienced frequent trypanosomiasis outbreaks. These were the focus of major, widespread quasi-military control campaigns, initially focused on eradicating wildlife hosts [14] , later on eradicating the fly using chemical sprays, baits and traps, and the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), and more recently drugs and vaccines [15] . The same time period has also seen major changes in vegetation and land cover linked to human population growth, in-migration and settlement, and the expansion of agriculture, especially cash-cropping. It seems likely that these ecosystem-livelihood changes have-perhaps more than official tsetse control efforts-brought about a reduction in tsetse populations and trypanosomiasis cases, in a similar dynamic to that experienced in the Luangwa Valley in Zambia. Nevertheless, the problem persists. Eleven cases of HAT were reported in 2010, three in 2013 and 2014, and one in 2015. It is likely that numbers in reality are much higher since villagers rarely report sleeping sickness, cases reported to local clinics are often missed [16] and some choose to manage the disease traditionally instead [17] . The Zimbabwe case study sought to understand the ecosystem-livelihood dynamics accounting for this persistence of trypanosomiasis risk, and who is vulnerable to it.",

Previous studies have shown that the rodent is most abundant in villages and surrounding backyard gardens, rather than in more distant farmland or forest [31, 32] . Few studies have identified an age-or gender-associated risk for LF [33] [34] [35] [36] , yet research has not been fine grained and suffers from poor incidence and prevalence data. Exposure to the virus is believed to occur through contact with rodent urine/faecal contamination of food, water and surfaces. Most speculation about Lassa exposure has centred on rodent-human interactions in and around homes, while the only recognized rodent-associated risk factor for LF is hunting of rodents for food consumption [37] . However, in Sierra Leone, reported LF incidence fluctuates seasonally, with peaks in the dry season (February-March) and a smaller peak in the rainy season (June/July) [36] , suggesting that climatological factors and agricultural labour patterns may impact rodent-human contact. Anthropological literature from the region suggests that exposure in homes and agricultural activity could be differentiated by gendered and age-specific labour and livelihood activities [38] , and that villagers prefer to consume 'bush' rather than 'town' rodents [39] . This raises the likelihood of differentiated but widespread exposure to LF shaped by livelihood-related ecosystem interactions beyond the village.",

We originally planned to collect ecological and social science data in all communities at eight time points over 2 years, but activities were disrupted from June 2014 to July 2015 due to the Ebola epidemic.

However, bats are known to be reservoirs of several zoonotic pathogens and have been implicated in the transmission of deadly filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg, and paramyxoviruses such as Hendra and Nipah viruses [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Henipaviruses have been isolated from bats in Australia and Asia, and evidence of infection has been reported in bats from Africa [48, [52] [53] [54] [55] . Henipaviruses cause encephalitic disease in humans and domestic animals with extremely high case fatality rates [56, 57] . Evidence of henipaviruses in human populations has not been established as yet in Ghana; however, there is evidence of henipavirus circulation in bats within the country [48] , suggesting the potential for a disease spillover from bats to humans, although no formal risk assessments have yet been carried out. The case study sought a better understanding of possible points of disease risk by exploring the prevalence and location of bats in Ghana, how people interact with bats in the context of their livelihoods and use of ecosystems, how this differed by social group and between rural and urban areas, and people's perceptions of bats and disease.",

The 37 Military Hospital is situated in the centre of Accra near a transport terminal, and people living and working there are from a mixture of ethnic groups. Large numbers of fruit bats roost on mahogany trees along the main road in front of the hospital and within the hospital compound, thus exposing patients, hospital visitors and the general public using the transport terminal to bat urine and faeces. Bat roosts could also be found on trees in residential areas and on the grounds of the Parks and Gardens department located near the hospital. The Tano sacred grove is located in Tanoboase, a small farming community along the Techiman-Kintampo road in the Brong-Ahafo Region, dominated by people speaking the Bono version of Akan, but also with migrants from the north of the country speaking other languages. Sacred groves are patches of forest set aside by local communities and protected by traditional norms for a variety of religious and sociocultural purposes [58] . The site is estimated to support over 2 million bats during the peak season. The inhabitants are mainly small-holder farmers cultivating food and cash crops such as yam, maize, plantain and cashew.

Focus group discussions, participatory landscape mapping, transect walks and semi-structured interviews (a total of 340; 164 women and 176 men) were used to document livelihood practices, humanbat interactions, and people's perceptions of bats and disease (see [59] for details).

Direct exposure to the possibility of disease spillover involved bat hunting, which was common, Indirect exposure to disease risks resulted from regular exposure to bats, bat faecal droppings, bat urine and bat saliva through livelihood activities such as farming and fruit collection (e.g. handling of fruits half-eaten by bats), domestic animal husbandry, where domestic animals such as pigs are housed under bat roosts and often feed on fruits half-eaten by bats, and trading and selling of wares under bat roosts-a common occurrence at the 37 Military Hospital and the Golokuati township where the town market was held under a huge bat roost. Indirect exposure to bats also occurred through social activities including recreation and community meetings under trees on which bats roost. In the Golokuati township, people actually lived with bats in their homes. Bats roosted on trees in people's courtyards and people went about their daily household chores, such as food preparation, washing and social activities (e.g. women gathering to plait their hair), under bat roosts.

Several of the case study diseases show both endemic patterns of continuous spillover, combined with outbreaks, which in turn can be related to sudden or episodic ecosystem changes. Thus RVF outbreaks are associated with episodes of above-normal rainfall linked to El Ni\u00f1o cycles. Outbreaks of haemorrhagic fevers (such as Lassa fever, as well as Ebola) have elsewhere been associated with exceptionally sudden-onset dry season conditions, although our study timescales were insufficient to identify such outbreak dynamics in the case studies themselves. Conducted over a 2-3 year timescale, however, the case studies have been able to reveal seasonal changes in the prevalence of animal disease reservoirs and vectors. Both the Zimbabwe and Zambia study sites have one rainy season with quite pronounced seasonal effects on both tsetse and wildlife populations. In Kenya, populations of RVF-carrying mosquito populations vary annually across the seasonal cycle, while in the case of Sierra Leone, rodent habitats shift with seasonal cycles of upland farm-fallow and swamp rice-vegetable garden dynamics. Notably, in these latter cases the key seasonal dynamics with respect to disease depend on seasonally varying agricultural and agro-pastoral land use as well as climate.",

All the case studies involved a spatially identified local system, although bounded in different ways in keeping with the problem to be addressed: contrasting urban/rural settlements and their surrounding landscapes in Sierra Leone and Ghana; a pair of districts with contrasting levels of irrigation in Kenya; and contiguous wildlife/pastoral/agricultural areas in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Within each, though, spatial dynamics are a key part of the unfolding story of ecosystemanimal-disease interactions. In Zambia, these relate mainly to land use differentials along a gradient in altitude; in Zimbabwe, to the patch dynamics of woodland amidst agropastoral land use; in semi-arid Kenya, to contrasts between irrigated commercially farmed areas, and those dominated by rangelands; and in Ghana and Sierra Leone, to the location and size of settlements, and patches of different types of land use within shifting mosaics, in ecological settings where rodents and bats occupy peri-domestic spaces. Whatever the details, all the cases highlight the importance of micro-differences within local systems, and of mosaic and patch dynamics, as ecological, human and animal population factors interact. Third, the critical question with respect to human vulnerability to zoonotic spillover concerns how people interact with these dynamic ecosystems, and the extent to which these interactions expose them to pathogen-carrying wildlife, livestock or vectors. The case studies reveal a wide array of ecosystem interactions that are central to people's livelihoods and well-being. Shaped by varied political economies and social relations, and with local variation in the resources available, valued and used, these include pastoralism and agropastoralism (Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia); commercial and subsistence farming (all cases); hunting (all cases); and the collection of food, firewood and medicines (all cases). As the examples of sacred forests in Ghana and pilgrimage sites in Zimbabwe illustrate, particular sites within ecosystems are also visited as part of cultural and ritual practices. Everyday living and movement in a settlement or landscape, for social and non-directly ecosystem-dependent livelihood purposes such as trade, can also bring people into contact with pathogen-carrying animals-as in the cases of bat roosts in Ghana and Lassa-carrying rodents in Sierra Leonean villages. While revealing the multiplicity and diversity of livelihoodrelated ecosystem interactions, however, the cases also point to significant social differences in livelihood profiles and ecosystem use, which in turn can suggest particular, socially differentiated vulnerabilities to disease. The examples of women gardeners' vulnerability to Lassa fever, or the vulnerability of squatters and hunters drawn to tsetse-inhabited woodland patches to trypanosomiasis in Zimbabwe, exemplify the broader point that 'who gets sick and why' depends on social and livelihood difference as these intersect with ecologies [63] .",

For instance in Zambia and Zimbabwe, landscape transformation for commercial farming has been synergistic with a reduction of trypanosomiasis risk. The retention and use of woodland patches is vital for some people's livelihoods-but brings the trade-off of tsetse exposure. In Kenya, irrigation has brought commercial agricultural profits and employment, at least to some people; but it has also enhanced RVF transmission. In Sierra Leone, dry season vegetable gardening is a vital addition to women's livelihoods and economic independence, but also exposes them to Lassa fever. In Ghana, the use of bats for bushmeat is a valuable source of livelihood and well-being for many people-but also brings disease risk. Such synergies and trade-offs can be helpfully clarified in the concepts and language of ecosystem services [64, 65] . People interact with and make use of a variety of ecosystem services in the course of their lives and livelihoods, which may be provisioning, regulating, supporting or cultural services. Yet in so doing, they may also experience the 'ecosystem disservice' of disease. Interventions that enhance some ecosystem services may also increase the ecosystem disservice of disease risk (as in irrigation which enhances the service of hydrological regulation, but increases the disservice of RVF transmission). Disease regulation can also be conceptualized as an ecosystem service; framed thus, the land-use changes in the RVF case, for instance, can be seen to have reduced the wildlife and dryland vegetation conditions that kept RVF transmission to people and livestock at a relatively low level, and irrigation has disrupted such disease regulation.",

Equally, interventions and monitoring can be time-targeted, focused on the seasons or weather events that pose most risk. Second, an understanding of local ecosystem-animallivelihood-disease interactions provides both a justification and basis to look beyond single-sector approaches, to locally attuned 'One Health' approaches. Thus addressing Lassa fever in Sierra Leone, our analysis suggests, could benefit from joined-up thinking and action between health and agricultural practitioners, in identifying potential solutions that link disease control with the management of rodents as agricultural pests.
