            "text": "There is a rich history of models for the interaction of a biological contagion like influenza with the spread of related information such as an influenza vaccination campaign. Recent work on the spread of interacting contagions on networks has highlighted that these interacting contagions can have counter-intuitive interplay with network structure. Here we generalize one of these frameworks to tackle three important features of the spread of awareness and disease: one, we model the dynamics on highly clustered, cliquish, networks to mimic the role of workplaces and households; two, the awareness contagion affects the spread of the biological contagion by reducing its transmission rate where an aware or vaccinated individual is less likely to be infected; and three, the biological contagion also affects the spread of the awareness contagion but by increasing its transmission rate where an infected individual is more receptive and more likely to share information related to the disease. Under these conditions, we find that increasing network clustering, which is known to hinder disease spread, can actually allow them to sustain larger epidemics of the disease in models with awareness. This counter-intuitive result goes against the conventional wisdom suggesting that random networks are justifiable as they provide worst-case scenario forecasts. To further investigate this result, we provide a closed-form criterion based on a two-step branching process (i.e., the numbers of expected tertiary infections) to identify different regions in parameter space where the net effect of clustering and co-infection varies. Altogether, our results highlight once again the need to go beyond random networks in disease modeling and illustrate the type of analysis that is possible even in complex models of interacting contagions.",

            "text": "Epidemics of infectious diseases obviously interact with human behaviour, and mathematical models provide a principled way of studying these interactions. Unfortunately, the same scenario becomes less tractable when behaviour is affected by a social contagion, such as the #FlattenTheCurve message currently spreading on social media in the hope of slowing the spread of COVID-19. Interactions across contagions are multi-dimensional: The messaging raises awareness and slows the spread of the disease around aware individuals by promoting hand washing and social distancing, and individuals who are experiencing the illness are also more likely to spread preventive messages. We model these interactions as a system of parasitic contagions where the awareness both benefit from and hinders the spread of the disease. We Models of contagion are used to study the transmission dynamics of a pathogen or information being transmitted through a structured population. Most of these are defined as compartmental models [1], which mathematically distinguishes individuals based on their state; i.e., whether they are susceptible to a contagion or infectious with that contagion. Using this approach, coupling different contagions to model their interactions is straightforward as we can then simply distinguish individuals based on all possible combinations of states for the different contagions. Of particular interest is the coupling of an infectious disease with the spread of preventative information related to the disease [2]. We typically expect this \"disease awareness\" to at least hinder, if not completely stop, the spread of the pathogen. Since both the pathogen and the information spread through standard contagion mechanisms, their coupled dynamics is often referred to as either antagonistic or dueling contagions. Here, we assume that the coupling between awareness and disease is twofold: Awareness reduces the transmission rate of a disease, but sees its own transmission rate increased by the presence of the disease. Studies in health psychology suggest that individuals are more likely to adopt preventative behaviors related to a disease -hand wawashing, self isolation, vaccination, treatment-seeking -if people around them adopt that behavior and/or if they perceive themselves to be at high risk of infection [3, 4] . Indeed, data collected during and after the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak and the 2009 A (H1N1) influenza pandemic indicate the adoption of preventative behaviors such as increased hand washing, the use of face masks, and avoiding crowded public spaces in response to these outbreaks and the increased perception of infection risk [5] [6] [7] . We therefore refer to this coupled awareness-disease system as one of parasitic contagions, since one contagion (awareness) both hurts and benefits from the other (the disease).",

However, there are a number of generalized frameworks that account for the fact that information and disease both spread over a network structure [9] [10] [11] , and these frameworks have become more common in recent years with the rise in popularity of multiplex or multilayer network models [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In the current work, we relax the well-mixed assumption to consider the community structure of most networks where connections are often grouped in dense environments such as households and workplaces. To do so, we rely on two recent mathematical approaches: (i) a compartmental model coupled to a clique-based master equation formalism [17, 18] that explicitly tracks the state of different groups; and (ii) a more straightforward two-step branching process analysis [18] that approximates network clustering.",

The two approaches are leveraged together in a case study presented in Section 3 where we show that there can be finite regions in parameter space where the disease can actually benefit from network clustering.

Awareness of the disease may cause individuals to respond by reducing their own transmissibility or adopting preventative behaviors. Here, we explored the effects of awareness in a model that looks at both disease and awareness as co-contagions in a parasitic relationship: spread of the disease leads to transmission of awareness which in turn leads to decreased disease prevalence as a result of reduced disease transmission around aware individuals. Our results show that interacting co-contagion models lead to different dynamics depending on the network structure on which they unfold. Characteristic measures such as the final outbreak size and the peak incidence exhibit regimes where they can be higher in networks exhibiting clustering than on equivalent but random network structures. Altogether, our study highlights once again the need for disease models to go beyond random networks as social clustering can lead to either smaller or larger forecasts depending on the dynamics at play. We showed how interactions between contagions can combine with network structure in non-trivial ways and are therefore especially important to include in disease models. To this end, we have generalized the tools of Ref. [18] to account for more complicated interaction mechanisms. In doing so, we end up with useful analytical tools, but their development becomes so involved and complicated as to be almost intractable. This raises the important problem of developing effective models for interacting contagions whose complexity does not grow exponentially with the number of contagions or with the number of interaction mechanisms. Indeed, not only do infectious diseases interact with social contagions such as vaccination and other preventative behaviors, but they also interact, often synergistically, with other biological infections [24] [25] [26] . New tools are therefore needed to account for all of these interactions in a tractable and insightful analytical framework [27] .",

With most of it now shared on online social media, information and messages regarding public health crises are increasingly important in shaping human behavior during epidemics. Unfortunately, data surrounding that messaging are not readily available to researchers and public health officials, even if we know it interacts in critical ways with our models and forecasts. The parallel development of theoretical frameworks and of data sharing protocols for social messaging related to public health crises will be invaluable going forward. Public awareness is an integral part of public health and advances to address its social media dimension should be integrated into existing public health surveillance systems.",

An open circle represents a susceptible individual; a shaded one, a contagious individual (infected with the disease, awareness, or both); and a black circle represents a group (or clique). The topology is constructed by allowing individuals to belong to a given number of cliques where they can be linked to other participants (solid lines). Note that in the formalism, the cliques are distinguished by their exact population and state, while the precise connections between them remain unspecified. Modified from Ref. [17].",

The dotted vertical line marks the analytical epidemic threshold (if any) as approximated by R All parameters are fixed to the following values unless we explicitly vary them:\u03b2 D = 0.02, \u03b2 A = 0.25, \u03b1 i = \u03c4 i = 1, \u03c1 IS U V = 1, \u03c1 II U V = \u03c1 =100 and \u03b3 XY U V = \u03b3 = 0.005 except \u03c1 IS SS = \u03b3 SI SS = 1.0. Differences in peak prevalence values between network structure. We again use the same network structure and parametrization as in Fig. 2, with a fixed \u03b2 D = 0.02, \u03b1 i = \u03c4 i = 1, and with other interaction factors parametrized as \u03c1 IS U V = 1, \u03c1 II U V = \u03c1 and \u03b3 XY U V = 1/(2\u03c1) except, \u03c1 IS SS = \u03b3 SI SS = 1.0. Panels a-c) show the time series of disease prevalence for three sets of parameter values while panel d) study a large range of variations in \u03b2 2 and \u03c1. The inset of panel a) provides a closer look at the epidemic peak of both time series. The color axis in panel d)shows the ratio of peak values obtained by integrating the mean-field system. The dotted line shows the crossover regime predicted by our analytical branching factor analysis; it defines the set of parameters for which R same on both clustered and random networks. Finally, parameter values used in panels a-c) are shown with markers on panel d).",
