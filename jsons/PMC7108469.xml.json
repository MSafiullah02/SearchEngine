This example, not typical, illustrates that clinical chemistry increasingly is filing the popular image of Big Business, complete with mergers, acquisitions, diversifications and all its other accoutrements. The major commercial laboratories are growing at what one official called an \u201cabsurd\u201d rate, with pretax earnings approaching 12% and steadily rising: not surprisingly, this gives the proprietors reason to expect even closer scrutiny by the federal government ( Clin Chem1977;23:1956-1957. ).The world\u2019s last known case of smallpox appears in Somalia.The number of hosts on ARPANET exceeds 100.British Airways inaugurates regular supersonic service on the Concorde.",
