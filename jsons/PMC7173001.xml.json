Originally, 135 of these specimens were tested by PFlu/PFAST and 140 were tested by RP. PFlu had demonstrated suboptimal performance with the circulating strain of A/H3N2 (sensitivity of 76%) and was excluded from further testing, as the initial intent of the study was to evaluate the performance of cIAB. All specimens were analyzed by cIAB and Xpt, while RP and PFAST were performed as needed depending on original clinical testing. No specimens were reproducibly problematic by any method, however, three (1%) specimens were initially invalid with cIAB and six (2%) specimens produced instrument errors on the Xpert. As per Cepheid, the instrument errors on the Xpert may be related to the VTM.",
