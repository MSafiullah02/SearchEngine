Case fatality associated with some snake bites reach 50% or more but can be reduced to less than 5% through antivenom therapy, the only available current treatment [5], [7], [8], [9]. Global mortality from snake bites may range from 50,000 to 100,000 per year, but these figures are likely underestimated [5], [10]. Viperid snake bite envenoming induces local effects, such as swelling, pain, necrosis, hemorrhage and blistering, often accompanied by secondary infection [9]. Systemic viperid envenoming is characterized by a complex pathophysiological profile including coagulopathy, hemorrhage, hypovolaemia, shock and acute renal failure [9], [11]. Progressive paralysis may be caused by elapid snake venom neurotoxins, and by some viperid venoms displaying neurotoxic effects. Some elapid venoms also induce local necrosis and rhabdomyolysis [9]. Snake bite survivors may have major chronic physical and neurological disability.",

            "text": "Antivenoms are most often made by fractionation of plasma of horses (less frequently sheep) that have been immunized with crude venoms [1]. Pooled hyperimmune plasma is processed to purify the horse immunoglobulin G (IgG) fraction that may be subjected to enzymatic treatment to obtain F(ab\u2032)2 and Fab antibody fragments, and caprylate or ammonium sulphate precipitation to improve their purity [1]. To some extent, some manufacturing steps have features similar to those used to prepare human plasma-derived IgG. Although there is no known transmission of any infectious agent through antivenoms (albeit under circumstances where rigorous clinical patient follow-up is difficult), theoretical concerns about the possibility of transmission of horse/sheep infectious agents to humans do exist. Recent natural transmissions of zoonotic diseases highlight the possible exchanges between humans and the natural reservoirs of biologic agents found in animals [15], and the inherent risk of emerging diseases [16]. Examples of such infections originating from animal (or avian) pathogens include human immunodeficiency virus, Ebola, Hantaan, Lassa, Nipah viruses and other paramyxoviruses, equine morbilli virus, West Nile virus, and probably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [17], [18]. The parenteral transmission of animal viruses to humans is also possible. Infectious SV40 virus of rhesus monkeys was a contaminant of early polio vaccines which were administered to a large number of people. Whether this was the way in which this virus was introduced into the human population is unclear and a controversial issue.",

Recently, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Product (CPMP) of the European Medicine Evaluation Agency has published a Note for Guidance on the manufacture and quality control of animal immunoglobulins and immunsera [19]. However, most manufacturers of antivenoms are located in the developing world and some of them may not be directly exposed to the state-of-the-art process validation concepts, nor have the financial and logistics capability to perform extensive viral validation studies to assess the viral reduction potential of the process they use. Therefore, we found it helpful to examine the viral safety of antivenoms by first reviewing the characteristics of equine viruses. We then evaluated the theoretical ability of manufacturing methods of antivenoms to inactivate or remove those viruses, through a comparison with the well validated technologies used to manufacture human plasma-derived IgG preparations. Finally, we want to emphasize that applying good manufacturing practices in the production of antivenoms, from the control of the animals to that of all production steps, and ensuring traceability in the whole chain of manufacture, represent the current best investment in the quality and safety of these products.",

After a few weeks to several months incubation, BDV can cause locomotor and sensory dysfunction followed by paralysis and death. BDV exists world-wide in horses, sheep, cattle, cats, dogs and ostriches and can affect a large number of warm-blooded animal species, including humans [24], [25]. The infection can be fatal, but the majority of carriers are asymptomatic [26]. Cross-species transmission of this commensal virus has not been proven, but zoonotic aspects of BDV should be considered [26]. BDV-specific antibodies and viral RNA have been found in humans with various psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis can be made serologically, but also by antigen markers in peripheral white blood cells, combined with nucleic acid amplification [26].",

Organ coagulative necrosis and CNS lesions are observed [27]. WEEV is not as neuroinvasive as EEEV and the encephalitis caused is not as severe as that caused by EEEV. A test to detect EEE and WEE viral RNA has recently been developed [28]. VEEV is present in both humans and horses but no evidence of transmission from horses to humans by normal routes of contamination has been found. VEEV has been identified in pharyngeal secretions and is stable when aerosolized; it has been shown to be stable in dried blood and exudates.

It is the reference virus for a proposed new genus within the Paramyxoviridae family, which also includes another newly identified zoonotic bat virus (Nipah), and the Salem virus. HeV has been recognized in Australia as a new zoonotic disease of horses since 1994/1995. This lethal zoonotic viral agent is endemic in certain species of fruit bats (flying-foxes) and over 20% of them in eastern Australia are seropositive [40]. Six species of flying-foxes in Papua New Guinea have tested positive for antibodies to HeV [40]. HeV does not appear to transmit readily between horses under natural and experimental conditions, or from horses to humans [41]. Horses can be infected by oronasal routes and can excrete HeV in urine and saliva [41]. The virus appears to be spread by close contact with body fluids, such as froth from infected lungs [42], via nasal discharge, saliva and/or urine [43]. The most important clinical and pathological manifestation of HeV infection in horses and humans is severe interstitial pneumonia caused by viral infection of small blood vessels. From 1994 to 1999, epizootic and epidemiological episodes of meningoencephalitis and severe acute respiratory syndromes were reported in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore [15], [44]. It may also cause nervous disease. Three incidents of HeV disease in horses have been recorded in Australia\u2014two in 1994, which caused the death of two humans and 15 horses and one in 1999, which involved the death of a single horse [45]. Infected horses can develop a severe and often fatal respiratory disease characterized by dyspnoea, vascular endothelial damage and pulmonary oedema. Nervous signs may also occur. A number of diagnostic methods have been developed [46], based on the examination of blood, lung, kidney, spleen, and, if nervous signs are present, also of the brain. PCR assays have been developed. A rapid and sensitive RT-PCR assay using a fluorogenic (TaqMan) probe was developed to improve the diagnosis of HeV infection [47].",

WNV is found over a broad geographical range and in a wide diversity of vertebrate host and vector species [54]. Until 1999, the disease was found in African, European, and Eurasian countries. More recently, there was an increase in outbreaks of illness due to WNV in animals as well as humans and numerous cases are currently reported in Canada and the USA. Infected humans may be asymptomatic and the transfusion of donated blood from such individuals has resulted in the infection and death of recipients. This has led to the introduction in 2003 of strict regulatory measures in Canada and the USA which include the testing by a PCR assay of all blood donations. WNV primarily circulates between birds and mosquitoes, while mammalian infections are incidental. Mammal biting mosquitoes become infected when they feed on the blood of an infected bird. Once this happens, people, horses and other mammals may get WNV. Infected horses are, however, unlikely to serve as important amplifying hosts for WNV in nature [55]. Many WNV-infected horses probably never show symptoms, but a study reported mortality rates close to 30% [56]. Early symptoms are often indistinguishable from other equine encephalitides including rabies, equine herpesvirus-1, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, and eastern, western, or Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis. A vaccine for horses has been developed, but one horse that received two doses died from the disease [56].",

Plasma from several animals is typically pooled into 20\u2013300 l batches and subjected to a fractionation process to isolate the IgG fraction. Following the initial use of crude equine immune serum, still reported to be manufactured by one producer [5], various methods of IgG purification and refinement have been introduced (\nTable 2). Most manufacturers use protocols derived from the basic method described by Pope [61], [62], modified by Harms [63], based on pepsin digestion at low pH, to obtain F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, followed by ammonium sulphate precipitation of antibody fragments [5], [64], [65]. This basic approach is combined with a number of additional steps, aimed at obtaining a purer [66] preparation, such as heat coagulation [64] and ion-exchange chromatography [66], [67]. The pH at which pepsin digestion is performed by various laboratories ranges between 3.1 and 3.8, at temperatures between 30 and 37 \u00b0C. Pepsin digestion is usually performed in undiluted serum or plasma (protein concentration: 60\u201390 g/l). Incubation times range from 40 min to 24 h and with varying pepsin concentrations [64], [65], [67], [68]. Thermocoagulation is used by many laboratories and consists of heating at 55\u201356 \u00b0C for 1 h [64], [65], [68] although not all methods involving pepsin digestion include heat coagulation [67]. Some fractionation protocols include an additional acidification step to remove some non-IgG globulins (\u2018euglobulins\u2019) which are unstable at acid pHs [66], [69]. One producer includes a bulk pasteurisation step in its antivenom production protocol [66].",

The conditions used for caprylic acid fractionation of equine plasma are as follows: plasma pH is adjusted to 5.8 and caprylic acid is added directly to this plasma to attain a final concentration of 5% (v/v). The mixture is stirred during caprylic acid addition and then for one additional hour, after which the precipitate is separated by filtration. Caprylic acid is then removed by either dialysis or ultrafiltration and the product is formulated before sterile filtration [72]. Some antivenoms are made of Fab antibody fragments, obtained by papain digestion of sheep IgG, at neutral pH, after sodium sulphate precipitation of IgG [73]. Affinity-chromatography or ion-exchange chromatography steps have been described in the production of some Fab antivenoms [74], [75]. Treatment with \u03b2-propiolactone has been evaluated to reduce complement activation by horse plasma-derived products [76]; however, it does not appear to be used routinely in laboratories producing antivenoms.",

The former need to be stored at 4\u20138 \u00b0C, since higher temperatures reduce their shelf-life and induce protein denaturation and aggregate formation [78].

            "text": "Monitoring the health of animals used for antivenom production is important [5]. Colonies of animals should be kept free of contamination through good husbandry or vaccination, where appropriate. Surveillance of the source animals should include screening for pathogens, health monitoring, including routine blood chemistry and haematology tests, and post-mortem examination. Ideally, animals should be kept under strictly contained conditions, but this is not readily applicable to horses. However, for instance, animals could be kept free of a particular arthropod-borne virus if they are maintained in an area free of the particular arthropod vector. If a particular pathogen is identified, it should be established whether it is present in plasma. Some virological screening methods may be performed, if available and epidemiologically relevant to a particular geographic region, to limit risk of virus presence in the animal herd and/or the plasma pool. To some extent the Guidelines from the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Association (FELASA), although not referring to horses, may serve as a reference [81], [82], [83]. Nevertheless, not all of these measures are available in many developing countries nor readily applicable to horses used for antivenom production, and pathogens can escape this surveillance program. This illustrates the need for manufacturing techniques to ensure a sufficient margin of safety with regards to potential infectious agents present in the manufacturing plasma pool. This also strongly emphasizes the crucial importance of ensuring an appropriate traceability system from horse donors to human recipients of antivenoms so that any potential infectious events or risks may be identified in a proper and timely manner and relevant counter-measures taken promptly.",

However, specific attention has been given to caprylic acid (also called octanoic acid), as it has been used as precipitating agent for human IgG. It has been suggested that the non-ionized form of the caprylic acid disrupts the integrity of the lipid bilayer and membrane associated proteins of enveloped viruses. Utilizing the dissociation reaction and varying the concentration of the ionized form of caprylate, a specific amount of the nonionized form of caprylate can be maintained over a wide pH range. Treatment of plasma protein solution with caprylate at acidic pH also readily inactivates lipid-enveloped viruses like herpes simplex virus type I, vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus, and Sindbis virus [86].",

The robustness of a treatment applied to three intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (IgG, IgM-enriched, and IgM preparations) has been investigated using HIV, BVDV, Sindbis virus and pseudorabies as model viruses [87]. The routine treatment conditions for these two IgG and this IgM preparation are indicated in\nTable 3. Kinetics of inactivation was determined over a period of 1 h of treatment. Complete inactivation (corresponding to more than 4.68\u20136.25 log) is achieved within the first minutes. Within a certain range, viral inactivation in the IgG product was not affected by pH (5.5\u20136.0), temperature (0\u201326 \u00b0C), and protein content (30\u201340 g/l). Above pH 6, and most specifically at pH 8, no BVDV inactivation was found. At a content of caprylic acid of 3.7 g/kg or less, inactivation of HIV is significantly reduced. Under the conditions applied during manufacture, caprylic acid leads to robust inactivation of lipid-enveloped viruses; pH is a particularly critical parameter and should be less than 6. These conditions have also been found to inactivate >4.7 log10 EAV, an equine virus used as a model (Dichtelm\u00fcller, personal communication). Another study reported the viral inactivation achieved during caprylic acid precipitation of non-IgG proteins from human IgG product [88]. At pH 5.1, 23 \u00b0C, and in the presence of 9 mM caprylate, \u22654.7 and \u22654.2 log of HIV and PRV, respectively, were inactivated during the 1 h treatment, but only 1.5 log for BVDV was inactivated. At 12 mM caprylate, \u22654.4 log of BVDV was inactivated within this time period. At pH 5.1, 24 \u00b0C, 19 mM caprylate, and pH 5.1, 24 \u00b0C, 12 mM caprylate, complete inactivation of BVDV and of HIV and PRV was achieved in less than 3 min. The authors also showed that 40 mM caprylate at pH 5.4 and 40 \u00b0C in supernatant IV-1, an intermediate in albumin production, inactivated \u22654.2 log BVDV almost instantaneously [88].",

            "text": "Several human IgG preparations are subjected to an acid pH incubation that was historically introduced to reduce immediate adverse reactions subsequent to intravenous injections. In the late 1980s, acid pH treatment was also shown to contribute greatly to the viral safety of human IgG preparations [90], [91]. The treatment of human IgG generally consists of incubation at pH 4, with or without traces of pepsin, at temperatures from 30 to 37 \u00b0C, using a protein content close to 50 g/l, and for more than 20 h. The treatment is intended to eliminate aggregates. Pepsin, when present, is maintained at low concentration to avoid cleavage of the IgG molecule. Several model enveloped viruses were shown to be inactivated under those conditions [92], [93], [94]. More than 5\u20138 log inactivation of HIV and other enveloped viruses used as surrogate models, such as Semliki forest virus (SFV), HSV, VSV, and CMV is achieved. By contrast, poliovirus, as other non-enveloped virus, seems more resistant. The presence of trace concentrations of pepsin added to reduce anticomplementary activity during this procedure has been shown to contribute little to virus kill of most processes [95]. Virus inactivation by acid pH and pepsin is influenced by several parameters. HIV, BVDV, SFV, and PRV are completely inactivated within 5 min\u20131 h at 37 \u00b0C but inactivation rate and extent is less at lower temperatures. Increasing the sucrose content from 0 to 15% reduced the rate of inactivation of PRV but not that of SFV. Increasing the NaCl content from 0 to 150 mM reduced the rate of inactivation of SFV but that of PRV was unchanged. An increase in the IgG concentration from 0 to 10% speeds up the inactivation of PRV but decreases that of SFV. Therefore, temperature is a major parameter in the virucidal efficacy of pH-pepsin treatment and the impact of solute composition is virus-dependent [93]. Some fractionation protocols used in antivenom production include a low pH treatment to induce the precipitation of \u2018euglobulins\u2019, which are plasma globulins unstable under these conditions. This step was shown to remove between 2.8 and 3.5 log of EIAV, Sindbis virus, poliovirus and porcine parvovirus [66]. Virus reduction may occur by co-precipitation with the discarded \u2018euglobulins\u2019 rather than by an inactivation process [66].",

Heat treatment of whole human plasma at 50 \u00b0C for 3 h, in the presence of a specific combination of stabilizers, inactivates more than 6 log of HIV, and more than 4 log of enveloped and non-enveloped model viruses [102].

In addition, vessels should have temperature controls and be designed to avoid \u201cdead points\u201d where important parameters such as temperature and pH could not be ensured. Similarly, liquid heat treatment or heat shock should be conducted in jacketed tanks with the solution stirred throughout the heat cycle to ensure homogeneity and all points in the tank should be within the specified temperature range.

            "text": "To date there is no documented example of viral transmission to humans from the use of antivenoms, whichever type of product (whole IgG, F(ab\u2032)2 or Fab) is manufactured [5]. Considering the difficulty in the containment of large animals like horses, and in an exhaustive viral testing of the starting plasma, the viral safety of antivenoms appears therefore largely dependent upon the capacity of manufacturing processes to reduce infectious agents and on the use of good manufacturing practices, in particular in ensuring production traceability. By contrast to human plasma products, most antivenoms are currently not subjected to purposely introduced viral reduction steps like solvent-detergent, pasteurisation, or nanofiltration [80], [109], [110]. However, a comparison with validated manufacturing processes used for human IgG clearly indicates that at least two widely used antivenom production steps, caprylic acid treatment and low-pH incubation, are likely to contribute in a robust manner to viral safety, at least against enveloped viruses. The concentration of caprylic acid (5%) used for antivenoms is higher than that used for human IgG (Table 3), and the pH of treatment is within the effective range (less than pH 6) required for optimal inactivation of enveloped viruses. As the treatment is performed on equine plasma itself, or on crude fractions, the viral kill could be reduced by the presence of lipids. The acid incubation of antivenoms which is performed at a pH (3.1\u20133.8), less than that used for human IgG, and at a similarly warm temperature (30\u201337 \u00b0C) (\nTable 5) should provide a fast rate of inactivation of lipid-enveloped viruses, and possibly also non-enveloped viruses. However, the incubation time (40 min\u201324 h) is for some processes significantly less than for human IgG (typically 22\u201325 h), probably reducing the extent of viral kill achieved. Preliminary viral kill data obtained with antivenoms confirm that conditions used for peptic cleavage at low pH of F(ab\u2032)2 achieve robust inactivation of WNV [111]. We recommend that further representative viral validation studies using a range of well-established virus models are performed to know the rate and extent of viral kill actually achieved during those production steps. The viruses to use for those validations should be discussed with specialized virologists, and, by analogy with most studies done with human plasma derivatives, might include three lipid-enveloped viruses (such as BVDV, VSV, PSR, and WNV) and one non-enveloped virus (such as EMC, poliovirus, or Reovirus 3). Inactivation data could then be compared to viral kills achieved using similar process steps of human IgG products, therefore providing some reference on their robustness and allowing manufacturers and national regulatory authorities to assess scientifically the margin of safety of antivenom products. Other manufacturing steps, such as heat coagulation, could be validated as well. Formulation of the product at low pH, as done for some human IgG preparations, is another potential approach to consider for improved viral safety, but evaluating product stability and efficacy under such conditions would be a pre-requisite. In view of their expected beneficial impact on viral safety, appropriate process implementation of caprylic acid treatments and low-pH incubations should be ensured, as well as measures taken to avoid risks of downstream contamination and, more widely, to respect good manufacturing practices and traceability concepts. Such conclusions should also be valid for other animal plasma-derived IgG products used in human medicine such as anti-lymphocyte/T-cell, anti-toxins, and anti-bacterial or viral agents sera [19].",
