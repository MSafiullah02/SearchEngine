In humans, more than 3,400 different human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules have been registered (as of January 2011), and this number is currently growing rapidly as more efficient HLA typing techniques are employed worldwide. The polymorphism of the MHC-I molecule is concentrated in and around the peptide-binding groove, where it determines the peptide-binding specificity. Due to this polymorphism, it is highly unlikely that any two individuals will share the same set of HLA-I molecules thereby presenting the same peptides and generating T cell responses of the same specificities\u2014something, that otherwise would give microorganisms a strong evolutionary chance of escape. Rather, this polymorphism can be seen as diversifying peptide presentation thereby individualizing T cell responses and reducing the risk that escape variants of microorganisms might evolve.",

Since then, we have developed large-scale tools that are generally applicable towards this goal: production, analysis, prediction and validation of peptide\u2013MHC interactions (Ferre et al. 2003; Harndahl et al. 2009; Hoof et al. 2009; Larsen et al. 2005; Lundegaard et al. 2008; Nielsen et al. 2003, 2007; Ostergaard et al. 2001; Pedersen et al. 1995; Stranzl et al. 2010; Stryhn et al. 1996), and a \u201cone-pot, read-and-mix\u201d HLA-I tetramer technology for specific T cell analysis (Leisner et al. 2008). Here, we demonstrate that many of these tools can be transferred to other vertebrate animals as exemplified by an important livestock animal, the pig. We have successfully generated a recombinant swine leukocyte antigen I (SLA-I) protein, SLA-1*0401, one of the most common SLA molecules of swine (Smith et al. 2005). Using this protein, we have developed the accompanying biochemical peptide-binding assays and demonstrated that the immunoinformatics tools originally developed to cover all HLA-I molecules, despite the evolutionary distance, can be applied to SLA-I molecules. We suggest that the \u201chuman MHC project\u201d can be extended to cover other species of interest.",

Briefly, the genes encoding human or pig \u03b22m were N-terminally fused to a histidine affinity encoding tag (HAT) followed by a restriction enzyme encoding tag (FXa), inserted into the pET28 vector and expressed in inclusion bodies in E. coli. The fusion proteins were extracted into 8 M urea, purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and refolded by dilution. The fusion tags were then removed by FXa restriction protease digestion. The liberated intact and native human or pig \u03b22m were purified by IMAC and gel filtration chromatography, analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis, concentrated, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use (Fig. 1).\n\n",

We have previously demonstrated that denatured MHC molecules can de novo fold efficiently, however, only in the presence of appropriate peptide. The concentration of peptide\u2013MHC complexes generated was measured in a quantitative sandwich ELISA (using streptavidin as capture layer and the monoclonal anti-\u03b22m antibody, BBM1, as detection layer) and plotted against the concentration of peptide offered (Sylvester-Hvid et al. 2002). A prefolded, biotinylated FLPSDYFPSV/HLA-A*02:01 (Kast et al. 1994) complex was used as standard. Because the effective concentration of MHC (3\u20135 nM) used in these assays is below the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD) of most high-affinity peptide\u2013MHC interactions, the peptide concentration, ED50, leading to half-saturation of the MHC is a reasonable approximation of the affinity of the interaction.",

Since this construct contains the entire peptide-binding platform of HLA-A*11:01, we reasoned that the binding of the HLA-A*11:01 restricted peptide, KVFPYALINK, could be used as a functional readout of the refolding, activity, and assembly of the entire chimeric molecule including the porcine SLA stalk. For comparison, we tested the supportive capacity of human \u03b22m and folding ability of the entirely human HLA-A*11:01. A total of four combinations could therefore be tested: porcine or human \u03b22m in combination with either HHP or HHH (where the first letter indicates the origin of the \u03b11 domain (Human HLA-A*11:01 or Porcine SLA-1*0401), the second letter the origin of the \u03b12 domain, and the third letter the origin of the \u03b13 domain). A concentration\u2013titration of heavy chain was added to a fixed excess concentration (3 \u03bcM) of \u03b22m and a fixed trace concentration (23 nM) of radiolabeled peptide. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the four combinations gave almost the same heavy chain dose titration with a half-saturation occurring around 1\u20132 nM heavy chain. Porcine \u03b22m supported folding of the chimeric (HHP) \u03b1 chain slightly better than it supported folding of the human (HHH) \u03b1 chain. Human \u03b22m supported folding of HHP and HHH equally well. Thus, a recombinant SLA stalk can fold and support peptide binding of the peptide-binding platform. These results also suggest that human \u03b22m can support folding and peptide binding of porcine MHC-I heavy chain molecules.\n\n\n",

We have previously described how PSCPL can be used to perform an unbiased analysis of MHC-I molecules (Stryhn et al. 1996). A PSCPL consists of 20 sublibraries for each position where one of each of the 20 natural amino acids have been locked and all other positions contain random amino acids. Analyzing how much of each PSCPL sublibrary is needed to support MHC-I folding (see examples in Fig. 6) and comparing each sublibrary with a completely random library, the effect of any amino acid in any position can be examined and expressed as a RB value. Further, an AP value calculated as the sum of squared deviations of RB values for each position can be used to identify the most prominent anchor position (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d for calculations). Thus, the specificity of a nonamer binding MHC-I molecule can be analyzed comprehensively with 9 \u00d7 20 + 1 completely random library = 181 sublibraries (Stryhn et al. 1996).\n\n",

We applied NetMHCpan to our peptide repository of about 10,000 peptides, which over the past decade have been selected to scan infectious agents (e.g., SARS and influenza, Sylvester-Hvid et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2010), improve coverage of MHC-I specificities (e.g., Buus et al. 2003; Christensen et al. 2003), etc. We extracted 29 peptides as predicted binders to either the SLA-1*0401, the HPP, or the PHP human/porcine chimeric class I molecules (some of the peptides were predicted to bind to two or even all three of these molecules). All these peptide\u2013MHC-I combinations were tested for binding (Table 3); 13 of 14 peptides bound to the SLA-1*0401 molecule with an affinity (IC50 value) better than 500 nM (6 with an affinity less than 50 nM); all 13 peptides tested on the PHP molecule were strong binders with IC50 values below 50 nM; and 3 of 12 peptides tested on the HPP molecule bound with an affinity better than 500 nM. Of the 39 peptide\u2013MHC-I combinations tested, 20 (51%) were found to be good binders, 9 (23%) were average binders, and 10 (26%) did not bind well (Table 3). This is in stark contrast to the 0.5% frequency of binders among randomly selected peptides (Yewdell and Bennink 1999).\n\n",

Since the NetMHCpan predictor successfully captured these chimeric specificities (see above), we reasoned that the predictor might also be used to perform in silico dissection of these specificities and used the P9 specificity as an example of such an in silico analysis. The NetMHCpan predictor considers a pseudo-sequence consisting of 34 polymorphic positions, which contain residues that are within 4.0 \u00c5 of the atoms of bound nonamer peptides (Nielsen et al. 2007). Of the 34 positions of the pseudo-sequence, 10 delineates the P9 binding pocket; however, only 3 of these, positions 74, 77, and 97, differ between SLA-1*0401 and HLA-A*11:01. To explore the effect of these three residues, we performed in silico experiments where we examined single substitutions Y74D, G77D, and S97I (the letter before the position number indicates the SLA-A*0401 single letter residue, whereas the letter after indicates the HLA-A*11:01 residue) as well as the corresponding triple substitution (YGS-DDI). As described above, PSSMs were generated for each of the in silico molecules followed by a specificity tree clustering (including SLA-A*0401, HLA-A*01:01, and HLA-A*11:01). Figure 8 shows this tree along with the sequence logo plots showing the predicted binding specificity of each in silico MHC-I molecule. Albeit the Y74D and G77D single substitutions showing some of the positively charged P9 peptide residue preference of HLA-A*11:01, they still clustered with HLA-A*01:01. In contrast, the in silico (YGS-DDI) triple substitution clustered with the HLA-A*11:01. This suggests that the NetMHCpan method is capable of defining the residues of the F pocket that determine the specificity of position 9.\n\n",

However, due to the extreme polymorphism of the MHCs, any attempt to address the specificity of the entire MHC system is a significant experimental undertaking. During the past decade, we have established a series of technologies to support a general solution of human MHC class I and II specificities. For MHC-I, this includes (1) a highly efficient E. coli expression system for production of recombinant human and mouse MHC-I molecules (both heavy chain and light chain (\u03b22m) molecules) (Pedersen et al. 1995; Ostergaard et al. 2001), (2) a purification system for obtaining the highly active pre-oxidized MHC-I heavy chain species (Ferre et al. 2003), (3) a high-throughput homogenous peptide\u2013MHC-I binding assay for obtaining large data sets on peptide\u2013MHC-I interactions (Harndahl et al. 2009), (4) a positional scanning combinatorial peptide library approach for a robust and unbiased analysis of the specificity of any MHC-I molecule (Stryhn et al. 1996), (5) an immunobioinformatics approach to generate predictors of the peptide\u2013MHC-I interaction, NetMHCpan, that allows predictions to be made for any human MHC-I molecules, HLA-I, even those that have not yet been covered by existing data set (Hoof et al. 2009; Nielsen et al. 2007), and finally (6) we have demonstrated that pre-oxidized MHC-I molecules can be used to generate MHC-I tetramers in a simple \u201cone-pot, mix-and-read\u201d manner (Leisner et al. 2008). Here, we propose that the next goal should be to extend the overall approach to MHC-I molecules of other species of interest. Mouse and rats have been extensively studied in the past, but much less reagents and information have accrued for the MHC-I molecules of other species. Here, we have used an important livestock animal, the pig, as a model system and demonstrated that it indeed is possible to transfer the original human approach to other species.",

This chimeric molecule retained the peptide-binding specificity of the HLA-A*11:01 molecule, and it clearly demonstrated that the recombinant porcine stalk was functional and, by inference, also properly folded. It also suggests that the peptide-binding specificity of the distal domains do not crucially depend upon the identity of the proximal stalk. Further, comparing the ability of human and porcine \u03b22m to support MHC-I complex formation using either a human or a porcine MHC-I stalk, we demonstrated that every combination (porcine \u03b22m/human-\u03b13, porcine \u03b22m/porcine-\u03b13, human \u03b22m/human-\u03b13, and human \u03b22m/porcine-\u03b13) showed almost the same heavy chain dose titration with identical half-saturations. These results illustrate the ability for porcine and human \u03b22m to support complex formation of SLA molecules and vice versa and suggest evolutionary that the stalk is quite conserved.",

The latter solved the a priori problem of not knowing which peptides would be needed to support proper folding of SLA-1*0401, and it did so in an unbiased manner. Furthermore, this approach is highly efficient since it readily establishes a complete matrix representing the amino acid preference for each amino acid and each position of a nonamer peptide. The specificity of SLA-1*0401 shows two primary anchors: one in positions 9 with a preference for aromatic amino acids and another in position 3 with a preference for negatively charged amino acids. In addition, the SLA-1*0401 features a secondary anchor in position 2 with hydrophobic or polar amino acid preferences.",

            "text": "An alternative approach to solve the problem of identifying peptides that support folding of MHC-I molecules of so far unknown specificity is to use our recently developed pan-specific predictor, NetMHCpan. The successful use of this predictor to initiate peptide-binding studies was recently demonstrated for HLA-A*3001 (Lamberth et al. 2008). Although originally developed to cover all HLA-A and HLA-B molecules, it has also been shown to extend to MHC-I molecules of other species (Hoof et al. 2009). Here, we demonstrate that the NetMHCpan predictor is capable of extracting MHC-I sequence information across species and correctly relate this to peptide binding even in the absence of any available data for the specific query MHC-I molecule, i.e., the SLA-1*0401 as well as the chimeric HPP (h\u03b11p\u03b12p\u03b13) and PHP (p\u03b11h\u03b12p\u03b13) molecules. It is not clear why binding of the PHP chimera was more efficiently predicted than binding of the HPP chimera. One could speculate that NetMHCpan has not captured the effect of the different positions of the pseudo-sequence equally well and not all positions and pockets (and by inference\u2014not all chimeric molecules) are therefore predicted equally well.",

This result was also obvious from an inspection of the PSCPL analysis of the SLA-1*0401. The PSCPL analysis of the P9 specificity of the SLA-1*0401 and the two chimeric molecules suggested that the P9 specificity primarily was determined by the \u03b11 domain. This contention was further strengthened by a NetMHCpan-driven in silico analysis of the residues delineating the F pocket, which interacts with P9. This suggests that NetMHCpan can be used to design and interpret detailed experiments addressing the structure\u2013function relationship of peptide\u2013MHC-I interaction. In the case of SLA-1*0401, NetMHCpan suggests that Y74, G77, and S97 play a prominent role in defining the P9 F pocket. Whereas the NetMHCpan readily captured the P9 anchor residue of SLA-1*0401, it did not capture the P3 anchor (at least not in the 2.4 version). We surmise that this shortcoming is due to insufficient examples of the use of P3 anchors within the currently available peptide\u2013MHC-I binding data. Inspecting the pseudo-sequence of SLA-1*0401 and HLA-A*01:01 vs. HLA-A*11:01 suggests that the presence of an arginine in position 156 might explain the preference for negatively charged amino acid residues in P3. Future NetMHCpan-guided experiments could pointedly address this question, and the resulting data could complement existing data and be used to update and improve the NetMHCpan predictor.",

This specificity has successfully been used to search for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)-specific CTL epitopes in FMDV-vaccinated, SLA-1*0401-positive pigs, and the recombinant SLA-1*0401 molecules have been used to generate corresponding tetramers and stain pig CTLs (Patch et al. 2011). In conclusion, we here present a set of methods that can be used to generate functional recombinant MHC-I molecules, map their specificities and identify MHC-I-restricted epitopes, and eventually generate peptide\u2013MHC-I tetramers for validation of CTL responses. This suite of methods is not only applicable to humans, but potentially to any species of interest.",
