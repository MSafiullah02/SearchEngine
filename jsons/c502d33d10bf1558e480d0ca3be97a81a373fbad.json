This is certainly a challenging situation particularly for countries in a perilous socio-economic situation. With the rapid evolution of the disease, once introduced, making decisions becomes challenging particularly when past experience or data are not so relevant. This is when mathematical models could come handy to predict the evaluations of the epidemic. We designed a modified SEIR-type mathematical model which we assessed with up-to-date data of COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world, and in which the rate of transmission is derived from the observed delayed fatality rate. We used Brazil as an example for middle income countries and applied our model to the Brazilian context. We implement age stratification and a horizontal confinement followed by a \"vertical confinement\" exit strategy.",

Since the fatality rate of COVID-19 is disproportionate among the elderly, the 266 federal government has suggested confining only the at-risk age groups. Such a strategy 267 would limit the economic impact of the pandemic while at the same time minimizing An exit strategy of vertical confinement of individuals older than 60 year old by May 279 1st would see a second wave disproportionally affect the 50-60 age bin. The ICU cases 280 in this age range alone would bring the health care system to collapse and result in over 281 100 000 deaths. If vertical confinement is contemplated, it should be of the population 282 over 50 years old. However, this age range, 50-60, is also a part of the workforce, and 283 thus defeats the purpose of a vertical confinement. Moreover, we emphasize that our 284 model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from 285 contamination, while in reality there would be several practical barriers to it as the 286 confined elderly would depend on the young for most essential activities, and a perfect 287 lockdown would not be achieved in a multi-generational household, especially in close 288 quarters such as found in the low and even middle income neighborhoods common in 289 Brazil.

At first, only international travelers admitted to 236 hospitals had access to SARS-CoV-2 testing. Now there are diagnostic clinics and 237 universities involved in COVID-19 testing, but there is no national massive testing 238 strategy in place. Besides, each Brazilian state has the authority to put in place their 239 own strategy to address the epidemic. The states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, 240 containing the largest metropoles in the country, adopted larger strategies of isolation 241 with schools and stores closed early on while similar strategies had not yet been adopted 242 in other states. Bottom line, the resulting morbidity and mortality rates can change 243 significantly, resulting in dramatically different output numbers as the number of 244 infected people or the number of hospital beds needed.
