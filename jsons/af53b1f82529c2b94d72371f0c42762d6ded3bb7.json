Since there is no evidence for choosing one frequency over another, intervals vary extensively among protocols, both for intubated and non-intubated patients. Protocols generally include an intervention (toothbrushing and/or swabbing and/or oral moistening) minimally twice a day. Particularly for intubated patients, the suggested regimens range widely, i.e. from two times daily up to six times daily. To change such generic, costly and demanding care routines into individualized care that is tailored to the patients' specific needs it might be suggested to use an oral assessment score to determine mouth care regimes. Most assessment tools have, however, been developed for use in the care-dependent elderly. Recently, Ames and colleagues [14] developed an assessment scale specifically for critically ill intubated and non-intubated patients that, moreover, includes an interpretation of the timing of oral care based on the score. Although the authors report no measures of reliability or validity of the instrument, their tool might be a first step towards better matching timing and frequency of oral care to the specific needs of individual ICU patients and to turn 'more' into a 'less' of at least equal quality.",
