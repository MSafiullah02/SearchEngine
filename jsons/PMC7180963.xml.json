Amongst the noncommunicable diseases, respiratory issues are the third leading cause of death worldwide with 6.7% [1]. It is now a well-known fact, however, that respiration-related illnesses can also significantly increase the risk for CVD and other diseases. Especially in the case of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), close relations to increased CVD such as hypertension [2] and atrial fibrillation [3] have been reported. At the same time, OSA is one of the most common sleep disorders with an estimated 936 million people affected worldwide [4]. Respiratory parameters also play an important role in the clinical, postanesthetic routine. It has been shown that respiratory complications are major causes of prolonged hospital stay, poor overall outcomes, and increased mortality [5,6,7]. Outbreaks of respiratory syndromes such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [8] further emphasize the importance of tools for an early diagnosis [9]. From the described situation, it becomes evident that cardiorespiratory monitoring is one of the major fields to be addressed in the future.",

Current generations of wearable, noninvasive biosignal acquisition systems can be roughly categorized by their runtime and the physiological parameters of interest [10], as well as their implementation, biosignal selection, and whether or not they are organized into networks [11]. The physiological parameters addressed are oriented on the identified large health issues of the present and future. It is therefore consequent that a large number of systems focus on the cardiovascular system, activity measures, the respiratory system, and the metabolism. The selection of biosignals varies with the use-case and implementation. Commonly found modalities are the ECG, accelerometry, gyrometry, photoplethysmography, galvanic skin response, body temperature, bioimpedance methods, blood glucose, and ambient parameters. Systems can be designed to operate on their own or in networks such as body area networks, body sensor networks, or wireless sensor networks. Due to a variety of materials available ranging from standard printed circuit boards (PCB) and flexible PCBs to textile integrated electronics [12], implementations of wearable biosignal acquisition systems usually range from sensor shirts over chest straps, wrist-bands, and necklaces, to small adhesive patches implemented using flexible materials [13].",

The resting ECG is an effective screening method for athletes [14] and a tool for cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic adults [15]. In a chest pain emergency situation, obtaining an ECG within 10 min is recommended [16]. Transient symptoms such as arrhythmias are monitored using 24 h Holter ECG systems or over days or weeks using long-term systems, especially preceding and following ablation therapy [17]. Most of these systems still follow a traditional lead configuration with large inter-electrode spacing. It has been shown, however, that it is possible to synthesize multiple ECG leads from only a few standard measurements [18]. Only a few studies have investigated the possibility to obtain standard leads from short inter-electrode ECG lead systems [19], but some findings suggest that even a 12-channel ECG reconstruction could be possible using a single 5 cm patch device, which incorporates multiple small-distance ECG lead recordings [20]. Even though the lead field theory seems to support the concept of short-distance ECG recordings, no recommendations on application-specific placements have been established yet, and the evaluation of methods beyond ECG lead estimation from short-distance ECG leads is yet sparse [21].",

STIs are known to relate closely to ventricular failure, the rate of ventricular pressure rise, preload, and other indices [27]. Especially the pre-ejection period (PEP) and the left ventricular ejection time (LVET) have been found to be closely related to these measures. STIs provide insights into the temporal structure of the mechanical heart activity and can therefore contribute additional vital information about the cardiovascular system. Several approaches to assessing STIs are available, including echocardiography, impedance cardiography (ICG), photoplethysmography, seismocardiography (SCG), and PCG. Considering echocardiography as the reference, the PCG approach outperforms other methods when PEP and LVET are to be estimated [28], and PCG and SCG deliver comparable results estimating total systolic time and the electromechanical delay [29]. Therefore, several approaches of estimating STI from ECG and PCG have been reported [30,31]. Despite the work available on PEP estimation using the PCG, there seem to be diverging opinions about whether or not PCG can be used for PEP estimation in principle [29,32].",

            "text": "Assessing the function of the respiratory system is usually bound to obtrusive sensors. Especially in the context of sleep testing, flow sensors such as face masks or nasal cannula pressure sensors and effort sensors such as respiratory inductance plethysmography chest and abdominal belts are still recommended [33]. While the development of an unobtrusive home sleep test system took important steps forward, the expert opinion remains that further research regarding the minimum number of parameters and methods of signal acquisitions is required [34]. A promising technique for unobtrusive respiratory signal estimation is ECG-derived respiration (EDR), which is commonly used in conjunction with other signal modalities such as photoplethysmography (PPG) [35]. An obvious advantage of EDR in the case of an available ECG is that no additional sensor is needed to estimate respiratory parameters. It is widely accepted that the ECG is modulated in three main aspects by the respiration: baseline wandering, heart rate, and QRS morphology. EDR methods aim to use one or more of these measures to estimate respiratory parameters. The extraction of the heart rate is less sensitive to ECG position and electrode distances due to the electrically strong QRS complex. The usability of morphological features, however, more strongly depends on the lead location. Especially in the context of small sensor systems placed at non-standard positions, this becomes important [36].",

Other approaches used to estimate respiratory signals include respiratory sounds, breathing air temperature, humidity and components [37], the oscillometric cuff pressure, Korotkoff sounds, as well as the seismocardiogram (SCG) [38]. For the latter, it has been shown that the morphology of the vibrational cardiac waveforms varies with the respiratory volume [39,40], and methods of extracting respiratory phases [41,42], effort [43] and breathing states such as normal, breathless, long, and labored [44] have been proposed. However, the interindividual morphological variations, as well as dependencies on numerous parameters including subject position, are still challenging [45]. SCG and PCG are closely related [46], with differences mostly defined by their frequency ranges [47]. However, the application of PCG signals for respiratory signal estimation seems not to have been proposed yet. The authors assume that one reason is the unavailability of appropriate long-term monitoring stethoscope systems.",

Using the derived standard ECG leads, we classify the ECG fiducial points and the PCG S1 and S2 peaks in the stethoscope signal. This information is used to estimate PEP and LVET. Finally, respiratory signals and rates are estimated using ECG-derived respiration techniques combined with a novel phonocardiogram-derived respiration (PDR) approach. Figure 2 gives a simplified overview of the processing steps. We evaluate our approaches using two commercially available reference systems (SOMNOmedics SOMNO HDTM and Osypka ICON-CoreTM) acquiring reference ECG signals, PEP, LVET, and respiratory flow in a study including 10 healthy subjects with 33 min measurements each in different body positions.

Two commercially available biosignal acquisition systems were used alongside the patch to acquire reference data. The Osypka Medical GmbH ICON-CoreTM monitor was employed to record a bioimpedance signal (200 Hz), an ECG corresponding to the Einthoven II lead (200 Hz), as well as beat-to-beat reference values for PEP and LVET (resolution of 5 ms). The ICON-Core calculates the PEP as the time between the Q-peak in the ECG and the B-point in the ICG signal. The LVET is calculated as the time between the B-point and the X-point in the ICG. Figure 3a visualizes the PEP and LVET definitions used throughout this work. The SOMNOmedics GmbH SOMNO HDTM polygraphy system was used to record reference respiratory flow (512 Hz) using a pneumotachometer and facial mask, as well as a second ECG corresponding to Einthoven I (1024 Hz). The patch system was attached at an angle of 45\u00b0 between the first and second intercostal space (ICS) at the right midclavicular line. The four electrodes of the ICON-Core were attached at the first and second ICS on the sternum, as well as at the fifth and sixth ICS on the left midaxillary line.

In order to robustify the PCG peak detection in the presence of noise, several additional processing steps followed the raw detection phase detailed by Varghees et al., replacing the original S1 and S2 classification approach. First, identified peak candidates were analyzed for completeness. For each peak candidate, a start, local maximum, and end had to be available. If one or more were missing, the candidate was discarded. Using the ECG and the current heart rate, a window from each R-peak to 75% of the current heart cycle length was defined where S1 and S2 candidates were identified. If exactly two peak candidates were found in that window, the peak closer to the R-peak was defined as S1 and the second one as S2. If less than two peaks were found, the peak was discarded. When more than two candidates were found in the window, the peak closest to the R-peak was defined as S1, and the peak closest to the T-wave was defined as S2. After peak detection and classification, the PEP was calculated from the ECG and stethoscope as:(7)PEP(n)=tS1peak(n)\u2212tQ(n),\nand the LVET as:(8)LVET(n)=tS2peak(n)\u2212tS1peak(n),\nwhere tS1peak(n), tQ(n), and tS2peak(n) are vectors containing the temporal location in seconds of the respective elements for each heartbeat n.

This finding confirmed the assumption for Einthoven I and II made by Lee et al. that an ECG patch system of that size could be used to estimate standard ECG leads [20]. By using only a single lead instead of multiple neighboring leads, an important additional restriction was introduced in our work, which further reduced the system complexity. However, in our investigations, linear and MLP models did perform similar to each other and did not reach the performance reported by Lee et al. By introducing TDNNs, similar performance values were achieved. We assume that by using multiple leads oriented differently on the body surface in their regression models, Lee et al. effectively added additional information that was not available in our single-lead approach. However, we can report that for Einthoven I and II, this missing information could be extracted from a single lead, thus removing the need for additional leads. Reviewing patient-specific data, a large morphological inter-subject variability of the minimal ECG lead was found, even though great care was taken applying the patch system in the same position for every subject. We must therefore assume that it is best practice to learn subject-specific regression models and therefore recommend an individualized approach. Future research could analyze the possibility of finding models able to generalize over subjects or cohorts.",

In the lateral positions, errors were 7% and 16%, respectively, highlighting the high position dependency of the estimation. The positive PEP and negative LVET outliers reported could be explained by a suboptimal S1 peak detection. The position of the S1 heart sound had a strict lower bound in its temporal position within the heart cycle. It could not be observed before the Q-point of the ECG. In the presence of noise, the distribution of the S1 peak position detection error had therefore a positive bias. Thus, the S1 peak position tended to be over-estimated. Given Equations (7) and (8), it then became plausible that PEP would exhibit more positive and LVET more negative outliers. Compared to the same position and for healthy subjects, the performances reported by Paiva et al. were in the same range, whilst slightly higher [30]. Differences in the performance were most likely due to the automated S1 and S2 annotation process, which suffered from the suboptimal placement of the stethoscope system for the task of STI estimation due to lung sounds. While Paiva et al. placed the stethoscope at the left sternal border, the placement of our patch was chosen according to a wider use-case spectrum and an emphasis on adherence in an ambulatory setting, which resulted in a much larger lung sound content and thus lower overall signal quality. It is worth noting though that similar placement issues are foreseen in a wearable, multimodal sensor application, and therefore, the procedure simulated typical use-cases and performances more accurately. Future research could further analyze the highly subject position-dependent estimation performances and compare SCG and PCG based STI estimation in a wearable context.",

The results were well within the range of other wearable respiration estimation systems using the ECG and an additional sensor, such as accelerometry [56]. The flow signal was estimated with a linear correlation of 0.66 relative to the flow reference. Using the first Eigenvector of the QRS complex, Langley et al. reported correlations to a flow signal of 0.58 [54]. Both the respiration rate and the flow estimation performances were dependent on the subject position, while still giving acceptable results in all three examined postures. It is worth noting that the number of outliers differed significantly between the three subject positions and mainly contributed to the, otherwise small, deviations of the error distributions. Introducing the additional ECG and PCG features compared to the single best ECG feature decreased the relative respiration estimation error from 13% to 8% and increased the flow correlation from 0.55 to 0.66. With an absolute respiration rate error below 1.2 bpm, the estimation of the respiratory signal itself, i.e., flow and tidal volume, should be emphasized in future research to remove the burden of masks, belts, and nasal sensors in respiration measurements.",

Due to the different subject positions, a more detailed analysis of the ambulatory use-case was possible. In addition, a range of respiratory frequencies and depths, as well as simulated apneas were part of the protocol. For the STI estimation, the reference system used an ECG-ICG approach, which is known to be less accurate than echocardiography [29], and in the presented case had a resolution of only 5 ms. Despite these limitations, the reference data stemmed from a clinically validated and approved medical device and should therefore be adequately reliable.",

It was shown that all three applications could be covered using a 55 mm single lead ECG integrated into a patch stethoscope system in the supine, lateral, and prone positions. In the case of Einthoven I and II, as well as the respiratory rate, the estimations showed very good agreement with the reference systems. PEP and LVET estimation performances were lower, but within the range of published results of other research groups. The slightly lower performances most likely resulted from the suboptimal placement of the stethoscope for cardiac auscultation. From a signal processing point of view, the presented results leave room for further improvements. Clinically, however, the correlations for LVET, PEP, and respiratory flow could be considered as very promising as the good results are substantially beneficial to future patients due to the positive trade-off of being non-invasive and not interfering with the respiration of the patients. Except for the ECG estimation, all parameters exhibited strong subject position-dependent performances. We found strong morphologic intersubject variability in all signals.",

In order to assess the long-term applicability of the presented system and methods, an evaluation by means of a full polysomnography in parallel with our patch device will be needed. Finally, respiratory signal, flow, and tidal volume estimation appear to be the next logical step after respiratory rate estimation to be able to assess the respiratory apparatus without masks, belts, or nasal sensors. We hope to further motivate and accelerate the development of truly multimodal acquisition systems that would enable the holistic long-term monitoring approach needed to tackle the cardiovascular and respiratory challenges of the future.",
