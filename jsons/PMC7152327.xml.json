Under normal circumstances, when the immune system of the host is fully functional, disease symptoms may not develop. If the host immune system is compromised, or the infectious agent overwhelms the immune system, an infectious disease ensues. Most infections are caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminthes, rickettsia, and fungi. Prions are responsible for slow-progressing neurological disorders such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.",

However, with the development of drug-resistant bacteria, fatal viral diseases such as AIDS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by variants of Corona viruses, this early optimism appears unwarranted. Although quarantine is effective in controlling the spread of diseases such as SARS and hemorrhagic fevers caused by Ebola virus, there is no effective treatment yet for many infectious diseases.",
