Several are currently on the market (tamoxifen for treatment of breast cancer12 and raloxifene for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis(a), (b)) or are in advanced clinical trials (lasofoxifene and bazedoxifene). SERMs are characterized by at least two common structural features, a phenolic hydroxyl group and a phenoxyethylamino group (phenyl-OCH2CH2N\u2013).(a), (b) The phenoxyethylamino group has been postulated to be important for binding to the central core of the estrogen receptor.14c It has also been suggested to influence the endometrial properties of SERMs in women by the antiestrogenic side chain.(a), (b), (d) We recently reported that the compound 4\n15 prepared in our current studies displayed very potent anti-bone resorption activity in vitro and exhibits a potent anti-osteopenic effect in vivo. This compound showed equivalent activity in vitro and in vivo assays for estrogen 2 and raloxifene. It is currently being examined for SERM activity and possible development as a new medicine to treat osteoporosis.16 Both the compound 4\n15 and (E)-(8-bromo-(E)-2-aralkenylbenzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazin-4-ylidene)acetaldehydes (5) possess the phenoxyethenylamino moiety through the furan oxygen atom and the nitrogen atom. This suggests the value of preparing derivatives from 5 and evaluating their inhibition activity for osteoclasts. We therefore planed preparation of derivatives of 5 to evaluate their biological activities.",

Some kinds of 2-acetyl-3-acylaminobenzo[b]furans (9d,15\n9e\u2013g, 9h,15\n9i\u2013o) were prepared by reactions of 8a and 8b with various acid chlorides such as (E)-5-phenylpenta-2-enonyl chloride,19 cinnamoyl chlorides,20 (E,E)-5-phenylpenta-2,4-dienoyl chlorides,21 crotonyl chloride, 2-hexenoyl chloride and (E)-2-methylbut-2-enoyl chloride. The physical and spectral data of 2-acetyl-3-acylaminobenzo[b]furans (9) were listed in Table S1, see Supplementary data. To a VM reagent prepared from POCl3 with dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 6 \u00b0C was added 2-acetyl-5-bromo-(E)-3-cinnamoylaminobenzo[b]furan (9d). The reaction mixture was stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 30 h, and an orange precipitate was deposited. Purification of the orange precipitate (presumed to be the immonium salt)1 was difficult because of its chemical instability. An orange suspension of this precipitation in water was treated with 10% NaOH aqueous solution with vigorous stirring, and an orange powder was obtained (Method A). The orange powder could also be obtained by treating the orange suspension with triethylamine (Method B). Recrystallization of each orange powder from CHCl3\u2013ethyl acetate (5:1) gave orange needles (representative 5a, mp 213\u2013216 \u00b0C, 46% (Method B)) (Scheme 3\n). 1H NMR (HMBC, HMQC), MS and elemental analysis data of 5a supported cyclization of oxazine ring fused at the 2- and 3-position of the benzo[b]furan ring. Compound 5a was presumed to be a novel (E or Z)-(8-bromo-(E)-2-styrylbenzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazin-4-ylidene)acetaldehyde with a characteristic exo-formylmethylene group on the oxazine ring. These data were, however, insufficient to confirm the structure of 5a. Attempts to prepare single crystals of 5a for X-ray analysis were unsuccessful. Thus, 5a was treated with diethyl 2-(diethylamino)-2-oxoethylphosphonate (11a) under Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons (HWE) reaction conditions to afford a butadiene derivative (12a) of which single crystals were successfully prepared. X-ray analysis of 12a demonstrated it to be (Z)-4-(8-bromo-(E)-2-styrylbenzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazin-4-ylidene)-N,N-diethylbut-(E)-2-enamide (Fig. 1\n).1 Consequently, a novel oxazine compound 5a was determined to be (Z)-(8-bromo-(E)-2-styrylbenzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazin-4-ylidene)acetaldehyde ((Z)-5a) on the basis of physical data of 5a and X-ray analysis of 12a.",

The terminal carbon\u2013carbon double bond of 12j has the E-form because of the observation of only NOE between Ha and the hydrogen of the phenyl ring (Scheme 4).

(E and Z-(8-bromo-(E)-2-aralkenylbenzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazin-4-ylidene)acetaldehydes (5) bearing the characteristic exo-formylmethylene group at the 4-position were prepared by this reaction.30 Unsaturated aldehydes (Z)-5 were reacted with several phosphonate reagents under two reaction conditions to afford the butadiene derivatives (12) having an ester or phosphonate or amide group on the terminal carbon in the butadiene moiety. The butadiene ester and phosphonate compound (12f, 12j) showed potent anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity comparable to E2 (17\u03b2-estradiol), and the evaluation of these activities of most of all prepared compounds is under way. These results including detail mechanism of biological activities will be reported elsewhere in due course. The exo-formylmethylene compound (Z)-5f and the butadiene amide 12p inhibited cell growth of MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7, respectively. In vivo studies for two kinds of biological activities are in progress, aimed at developing new drugs for osteoporosis and pancreatic cancer.",

Cells were then resuspended by collagenase digestion and plated over dentin slices (10 mm in diameter and 0.64 mm in height) in \u03b1-MEM containing 10 nM E2 or the oxazine derivatives on a 24-well plate (Greiner) for 2 days pit formation. Slices were dipped in 0.01 N NaOH, treated with ultrasonic waves to remove the cells and then dried and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1.0% sodium borate for pit counting. The decrease of the number of pits on slice indicates anti-bone resorption activity of test compound.",
