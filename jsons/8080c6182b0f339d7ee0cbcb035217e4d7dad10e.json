For example, the increasing trade in exotic animals for pets and as food sources has contributed to the rise in opportunity for pathogens to jump from animal reservoirs to humans. For example, close contact with exotic rodents imported to the United States as pets was found to be the origin of the recent outbreak of monkeypox in the United States, and use of exotic civet cats for meat in China was found to be the route by which the SARS coronavirus made the transition from animal to human hosts (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging).",

Furthermore, human behavior plays an important role in the re-emergence of diseases. Increased and sometimes imprudent use of antimicrobial drugs and pesticides has led to the development of resistant pathogens, allowing many diseases that were formerly treatable with drugs to make a comeback (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria, nosocomial infections, and food-borne infections). Recently, decreased compliance with vaccination policy has also led the to re-emergence of diseases, such as measles and pertussis, that were previously under control. The use of deadly pathogens, such as smallpox or anthrax, as agents of bioterrorism is an increasingly acknowledged threat to the civilian population. Moreover, many important infectious diseases have never been adequately controlled on either the national or international level. Infectious diseases that have posed ongoing health problems in developing countries are re-emerging in the United States (e.g., food-and water-borne infections, dengue, West Nile virus) (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging).",

            "text": "r Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV). HMPV was first identified in The Netherlands in 2001 in samples from children with respiratory tract disease (1). It is a new member of the Paramyxoviridae family (subfamily Pneumovirus). Although newly discovered, hMPV is not thought to be a newly evolved virus because it was also found in Dutch blood samples dating back to the 1950s. Instead, it is believed that this pathogen has long been a common but undetected cause of many human respiratory illnesses. Moreover, it has been suggested that hMPV may be the second most common source of childhood respiratory infections after the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and its association with respiratory disease in adults and children has been reported in Canada, Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, Japan, and Finland. In addition, data from Hong Kong have indicated that half of the SARS patients tested during the recent outbreak were also co-infected with hMPV. (5) . Studies in which NVs were molecularly characterized have shown that numerous variants co-circulate in the community, but occasionally shifts did occur in which a single variant dominated over a wide geographic area (6) . During the period 1995-1996, a worldwide epidemic was observed (7) . The mechanism of emergence of these variants is unclear, but one hypothesis is that they represent widespread common-source events (5). r Toxoplasma gondii. Recently, several water-borne outbreaks of toxoplasmosis have been described (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Data from Brazil and North America have indicated that unfiltered drinking water contaminated with the parasite's oocysts is the main source of infection. However, transmission of toxoplasmosis has also resulted from consumption of food or water contaminated with oocysts from cat feces or soil or by eating undercooked meat that contained oocysts (16, 17) . In Latin America, seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to T. gondii was found to be generally high, ranging from 51% to 72% (17).",

B. hermsii is a pathogen closely related to the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, and its vector is Ornithodoros hermsii(2). Though the tick-borne relapsing fever is endemic in the higher elevations and coniferous forests of the western United States and southern British Columbia, Canada, this is the first outbreak reported beyond the geographic range known previously in the United States. Patients usually become ill after sleeping in cabins infested with spirochete-infected ticks that feed quickly during the night.r Vibrio cholerae. During spring 2002, a resurgence of cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae O139 was reported in Dhaka and adjoining areas in Bangladesh with an estimated 30,000 cases of cholera.
