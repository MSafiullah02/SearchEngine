Halsted, MD, FACS [1]. Halsted made major contributions after his two years in Europe and fathered the Halstedian training model giving his landmark lecture at Yale in 1904 (Table 1\n) [2,3]. The subsequent transformation of orthopaedic resident and fellow education in the United States in the 20th century was profound. In January 1933, the AOA recommended the specific composition of a board for orthopaedic certification consisting of representatives of the AOA, the AAOS and the Section of Orthopaedic Surgery of the American Medical Association (AMA) [4]. This became the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) and soon thereafter the ABOS formed an Examinations Committee, an Eligibility Committee, and a Residency Training Committee. The ABOS was responsible for the evaluation of hospitals and medical schools that were educating young surgeons to become orthopaedic surgeons [5].",

Since its establishment, the ACGME introduced several landmark changes in orthopaedic surgical education. In 1999, the ACGME defined six core competencies in which residents must achieve competency during their training (Table 2\n) [8]. The accreditation model used by the ACGME shifted from process measures to evaluation of outcomes [8,9].",

This was the traditional education model that we accepted as the gold standard in the past before COVID. Learning new surgical techniques required participation in surgical cases, direct observation, travel to academic meetings, and cadaveric training. Any live surgical training post-fellowship was done by visiting surgeon programs and traveling fellowships. Maintaining up to date orthopaedic knowledge via peer-reviewed literature was done via subscription to journals arriving via postal mail (Table 3\n). Digital and web-based learning platforms were not available through this time period and ABOS/MOC exams required travel to take hard copy tests. However, with the advent of the internet and the ability to share content electronically, resident education in all medical specialties has been going through a gradual transition over the past decade.",

In the inaugural year of the WLA, 55% of eligible diplomats decided to use this format and over 95% said they were either moderately or very likely to continue with the WLA the following year [12]. Finally, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity of gathering for discussion in the way of a formal journal club meeting was being challenged with evidence supporting the use of smartphone messaging applications to lead electronic journal clubs and teach critical appraisal skills to residents [13]. The era of web-based learning, testing, and even group discussion was emerging prior to COVID-19 and will likely be solidified as we modify how we continue to educate ourselves as practicing orthopaedic surgeons and our surgeon trainees in the midst of this challenging pandemic.",

With most residency programs completely suspending normal clinical rotation schedules and overhauling residents into alternating coverage teams [14], concerns exist regarding trainees obtaining adequate time for proper orthopaedic education. Fortunately, the ABOS has swiftly and appropriately responded in these unprecedented times by increasing the \u201ctime away\u201d from residency training activities from 4 to 6 weeks per academic year to provide flexibility, which can further be averaged over the five years of orthopaedic instruction [15]. In orthopaedics, many issues need to be addressed such as the milestones system, and of paramount importance will be how training institutions will adapt to provide their trainees\u2019 adequate exposure to meaningful surgical opportunities or surrogate to meet ACGME minimum case requirements necessary to graduate and sit for board examinations [16].",

The effects on education will be acknowledged during this stage 2, by suspending accreditation and clinical learning environment review (CLER) site visits. Supervision of residents via telemedicine is allowed but self-study activities are suspended. Virtual lectures and journal clubs are permitted. ACGME fellows will be allowed to function as attendings for up to 20% of the time, and although work hours are not affected in stage II, requirements for graduation are left to the discretion of the program director. Stage 3 is deemed Pandemic Emergency Status. Declaration of emergency status begins a 30-day period during which all educational activities are suspended.

These new dynamics allow for both increased networking among the fellows and residents at the various shared sites and the attendings responsible for providing the education.

Most of these efforts have effectively served noble purposes for refining understanding.

Although primarily an entertainment tool at present, it is slowly making its way into training and education as well as surgical skills. VR can either provide augmented or mixed reality [32] and has the potential to increase participant enthusiasm in the educational activity. These platforms provide the opportunity for basic skill development and demonstrate substantial promise for the education of medical students and surgical residents. However, at present, most surgical simulators lack the definition and tactile feedback that are necessary for advanced skill development. While these technologies may help learners to acquire the basic motions for surgical performance, they lack the tactile feedback necessary to reproduce safe and effective surgery and have not been confirmed in the application of advanced techniques used in revision arthroplasty surgery. The post-COVID-19 environment will likely stimulate an emphasis for virtual technology development that, over time, will eventually provide both the visual and tactile feedback necessary to recreate joint replacement surgical reality. Initial applications will likely occur in the areas of primary joint replacement surgery. Effective partnerships between skilled surgeons, educators, and software developers will be necessary to ensure that future platforms address surgeon needs for both basic primary joint replacement and advanced reconstruction techniques.",
