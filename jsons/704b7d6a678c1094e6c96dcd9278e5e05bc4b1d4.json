We excluded individuals with unknown sex. Ontario is Canada's most populous province and is home to nearly 15 million residents who receive universal access to medically necessary services including laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 under a publicly funded provincial health insurance program. We obtained data for this study from the Ontario Ministry of Health as part of the province's emergency \"modeling table\", including deidentified line level data on all SARS-CoV-2 testing via the Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS) and from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) for all reported COVID-19 cases and related clinical outcomes.",

We used census data from Statistics Canada to compare sex-based testing by age with the sex and age distribution of the Ontario population. Among laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases, we used logistic regression to estimate sex-based odds ratios for hospitalization, ICU admission and death, adjusting for 10-year age intervals, with the level of statistical significance set at \u03b1 = .05. All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. received testing for SARS-CoV-2 between January 23, 2020 and April 28, 2020 (Table 1 ). There were 141 individuals excluded because of unknown sex.

These findings were consistent even with age adjustment, suggesting that the observed differences in outcomes between women and men were not explained by age or systematic differences in testing by sex. Instead, they may be due to sex-based immunological or other gendered differences, such as higher rates of smoking leading to cardiovascular disease. 5 The study is limited to a single region and could not control for underlying differences in sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities between women and men. We also could not identify healthcare workers-the majority of whom are women-which could explain some of the sex-based differences in SARS-CoV-2 testing. With the majority of regional health systems failing to report fully sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19, our study highlights how sexspecific reporting can guide a more gender-responsive approach to the global pandemic. 2, 5 In particular, our findings can inform pathways for COVID-19 care, including targeting older men as a particularly at risk group who may benefit from intensified prevention and earlier intervention. 2 .
