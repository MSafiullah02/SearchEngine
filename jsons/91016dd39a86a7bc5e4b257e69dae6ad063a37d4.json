The SEIR model is parameterized by the rates \u03b2 (infectivity), \u03c3, specifying E \u2192 I transitions and \u03b3 specifying I \u2192 R transitions. In terms of the data that is typically measured and reported, R corresponds to the total number of cases till the present date, while \u03b3I would be the number of new cases/per day. The number of deaths would be some fraction (\u2248 5%) of R while the number of hospital beds required at any time would be \u2248 (new cases \u00d7 typical days to recovery). An important parameter characterizing the disease growth is the reproductive number R 0 -when this has a value > 1, the disease grows exponentially. Typical values reported in the literature for Covid-19 are in the range R 0 = 2 \u2212 7 [11] . For the basic SEIR model one has R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3.",

Lockdowns (LD) impose social distancing and effectively reduce contacts between the susceptible and infected populations, while testingquarantining means that there is an extra channel to remove people from the infectious population. These two intervention schemes have to be incorporated in the model in distinctive ways [3, 4] -SD effectively changes the infectivity parameter \u03b2 while TQ changes the parameter \u03b3. Intervention schemes attempt to reduce this to a value less than 1. In the context of the SEIR model with R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3, it is clear that we can reduce R 0 by either decreasing \u03b2 or by increasing \u03b3. In this work we point out that for the same reduction in R 0 value, the effect on disease progression can be quite different for the two intervention strategies.",

The extended model considers eight compartments of Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), asymptomatic Infected (I a ), presymptomatic Infected (I a ), and a further four compartments (U a , D a , U p , D p ), two each corresponding to the two infectious compartments. These last four classes comprise of individuals who have either recovered (at home or in a hospital) or are still under treatment or have died -they do not contribute to spreading the infection. We do not include separate compartments for the number of hospitalized and dead since these extra details would not affect our main conclusions. For this extended SEIR model we discuss the performance of two different intervention strategies (namely SD and TQ) in the disease dynamics and control. We specifically point out that strong interventions (R target 0 < 1, aimed at disease suppression) can be understood using the linearized dynamics, while for weak interventions (R target 0 1, aimed at disease mitigation), one has to go beyond the linear theory.",

For R (target) 0 > 1, we have \u00b5 > 0 and this gives us the exponential growth rate (doubling time \u2248 0.7/\u00b5). On the other hand, for R target 0 < 1, the corresponding \u00b5 is less thab 0 and this tells us that infections will decrease exponentially. For the case where only mitigation is achieved (R target 0 1), we present analytic expressions for peak infection numbers, time to reach peak values, and asymptotic values of total affected populations, for the extended SEIR model. These provide useful guidance on disease progression and we apply it in the Indian context. We also show that, for the same reduction of R target 0 to a value less than 1, the corresponding \u00b5 magnitude can be very different for different intervention schemes. A larger magnitude of \u00b5, corresponding to a faster suppression of the pandemic, is obtained from TQ than that from SD. We give conditions for TQ to be successful: (a) it has to be based on contact-tracing and (b) it is necessary that testing numbers are scaled up according to the number of new detected cases. We show that the above picture gives us a comprehensive understanding of data from several countries which have either achieved disease suppression or mitigation.",

The current disease doubling time is around 14 days. For two different choices for the the fraction of asymptomatics (and typical values of disease parameters) our estimates suggest a current value of R eff 0 \u2248 1.3 and that the disease would peak between July to September. The predicted number of hospitalizations and deaths per day (assuming 1% deaths for symptomatic cases) have a large uncertainty but could be quite large (see Tables (I-III) , and there is an urgent need of preparing for this. However, the lockdown in India is now being eased. Given the huge economic and social costs of implementing SD, it is clear that a combination of weaker SD but intense TQ might be the only practical way of controlling the pandemic in India. A sustained and targeted testing and quarantining strategy (assuming community spreading is still limited), combined with some level of socialdistancing has to be implemented at the earliest and to the fullest extent. Community transmission is unlikely to have taken place in all states and cities in India. Increasing the testing-to-detected ratio to a value around 100 from the current value of \u2248 25 could result in lowering of R 0 and the \u00b5 value or at least in not letting them increase further. The paper is structured as follows. In Sec. (II) we state our main results. In Sec. (III) we make qualitative comparisons of the predictions of the SEIR model with real data on confirmed number of cases and make some heuristic predictions in the Indian context. In Sec. (IV) we define and then present the analysis of the extended SEIR model with and without interventions. We present some useful analytic results and closed form expressions as well as numerical results on different intervention protocols. We summarize our results in Sec. (V). Technical details and various analytical results are presented in two appendices (Sec. (A) and Sec. (B)).",

The number A is expected to depend on the population density and also how well SD is being implemented. Hence, while T (t)/D(t) \u2248 25 for India appears to be large, it may not be sufficient given that the population densities are much larger than in many other countries and implementation of SD may be less effective.

Another observation that we make is that, independent of initial conditions, the vector describing all the system variables quickly points along the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. Hence (at such longish times) if we know one variable (or a linear combination), then the full vector is completely specified. This leads to an accurate way of specifying initial conditions for the numerics (from insufficient data). This implies that different initial conditions (such as different seed infections) will only cause a temporal shift of the observed evolution. This means that if we plot data for different countries, starting from the same initial value of say the confirmed number of cases (normalized by the population), we should see a collapse of the data. We test this idea and find that indeed an approximate collapse of data is obtained for a number of countries (see next section).",

In particular we see the fast exponential growth and slow exponential decrease in new cases (following strong interventions). The two countries UK and US show a very slow decay rate, indicating that disease suppression has barely been achieved. The data for India, Brazil and Russia show the behavior corresponding to model predictions in Fig. (4) and have only been able to achieve mitigation so far (R target 0 > 1, \u00b5 > 0). Data from [15] the present observed data, for daily new cases in India (N \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 10 9 ), in the state of Delhi (N \u2248 1.9 \u00d7 10 7 ) and in the city of Mumbai (N \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 10 7 ). We consider the following choice of parameter values which appears to be quite typical: \u03c3 = 1/2, \u03b2 p = \u03b2, \u03b2 a = 2\u03b2/3, \u03b3 p = \u03b3, \u03b3 a = 3\u03b3/2 (i.e, assume that asymptomatics are less infectious and recover faster). This gives us [using Eq. (23)] \u03b3 e = \u03b3/(1 \u2212 \u03b1/3) and the effective reproductive number as R eff 0 = (1 \u2212 5\u03b1/9)\u03b2/\u03b3. From this last relation we can write \u03b2 = \u03b3R eff 0 /(1 \u2212 5\u03b1/9). Plugging this into the equation for the eigenvalues, Eq. (17), and replacing \u03bb by the observed mean exponential growth rate \u00b5 = 0.05 (the value observed for India since around April 10 [14] ), we see that we basically get an equation for R eff 0 in terms of \u03c3, \u03b3 and \u00b5.",

Looking at real data for new Covid-19 cases in several countries, we find that the SEIR model captures some important qualitative features and hence could provide guidance in policymaking. We use our analytic formulas to make predictions for disease peak numbers and expected time to peak for India, the state of Delhi and the city of Mumbai, but point out that these predictions could be incorrect for India (due to big inhomogeneity in disease progression across the country) and perhaps more reliable for the cases of Delhi and Mumbai. In general we believe that our formulas are easy to use and give quick heuristic estimates on disease progression, which would be reliable when applied to local populations (in towns, cities and perhaps smaller countries). Lack of precise knowledge of the disease parameters (e.g the fraction of asymptomatic carriers) of course leads to rather large uncertainties in the predictions.",
