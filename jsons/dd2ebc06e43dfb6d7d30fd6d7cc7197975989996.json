The utility of thawed plasma is twofold: (1) it provides rapidly available plasma for the management of massive hemorrhage, and (2) it extends available plasma inventory by avoiding wastage of plasma suitable for transfusion (Downes et al. 2001 ) . One rarely used plasma product, available in the USA, is liquid plasma. Unlike the previously described plasma products, liquid plasma has never been frozen; it is separated from a whole blood unit no later than 5 days before its expiration date and has a shelf life of 26 days from the date of the source blood collection (40 days if CPDA-1 is used as the anticoagulant for the parent component) (AABB 2013a ; Benjamin and McLaughlin 2012 ) .",

            "text": "Forms of pathogen-reduced plasma are widely available in Europe but until recently have not been available in the USA. Solvent/detergent-treated plasma (S/D plasma) is one of the most frequently used pathogen-reduced plasma products. Pooled plasma composed of a given ABO type undergoes viral inactivation with solvents (i.e., 1 % tri(n-butyl) phosphate) and detergents (i.e., 1 % Triton-X 100), which are subsequently extracted by oil and affi nity ligand chromatography for selective binding of prion proteins (PrP Sc ). This treatment signifi cantly inactivates lipid-enveloped viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis C as well as cellular pathogens such as bacteria and protozoa. While the pathogen inactivation process is ineffective against non-lipid-enveloped viruses such as hepatitis A (HAV) and parvovirus B19, product specifi cations identify minimum levels of B19 and hepatitis E virus (HEV) genetic material permissible, as well as minimum levels of neutralizing antibodies directed against HAV and B19 . This product had not been approved for use in the USA until January 2013, when the FDA approved Octaplas \u00ae (Octapharma, Austria) for transfusion (FDA 2013 ; Riedler et al. 2003 ; Ozier et al. 2011 ; Sachs et al. 2005 ; Sinnott et al. 2004 ) .",

Many guidelines recommend using the international normalized ratio (INR) at or greater than 1.5 as an indication for plasma transfusion (O'Shaughnessy et al. 2004 ). However, a consensus on laboratory value \"triggers\" for plasma transfusion has not been reached. For massive hemorrhage, empiric transfusion of plasma in set ratios to RBC units is widely practiced in the USA (Holcomb et al. 2013 ; Dzik et al. 2011 ) . Retrospective and observational studies on massive transfusion in military and civilian trauma have reported associations between higher plasma/RBC transfusion ratios and improved survival (Holcomb et al. 2013 ; Borgman et al. 2007 ; Shaz and Hillyer 2010 ) , although defi nitive data on optimal use of plasma in this setting has yet to emerge (Holcomb et al. 2013 ) .",

Nonpathogen-reduced plasma products contain slightly less than 1 U/mL clotting factors due to approximately 10 % dilution from anticoagulant solution and naturally occurring variability in factor levels between individual donors Eder and Sebok 2007 ) . Administration of a 10-20 mL/kg dose of plasma typically increases circulating coagulation factor levels by 20-30 % (Spector et al. 1966 ) . Standardization of clotting factors in S/D plasma manufacturing allows for more precise dosing; a dose of 12-15 mL/kg should raise most coagulation factors levels by up to 25 %. Plasma doses exceeding 15 mL/kg present increasing risks for volume overload in the recipient unless given in context of ongoing blood loss or therapeutic plasmapheresis (Murad et al. 2010 ; Popovsky 2004 ) . Standard dosing protocols are appropriate for FFP and FP24, as well as for liquid plasma as these three products are considered essentially hemostatically equivalent for almost all clotting factors except for FV and FVIII-despite slight variations between clotting factors existing between these products Eder and Sebok 2007 ; Downes et al. 2001 ; Sidhu et al. 2006 ; Yazer et al. 2008 Yazer et al. , 2010 Gosselin et al. 2013 ) (see Table 10 .2 ). The process of solvent detergent treating of plasma also results in a decrease in FV and FVIII (Buchta et al. 2004 ) . While remaining within regulatory requirements, declines in procoagulant levels may be clinically signifi cant and require patient monitoring Buchta et al. 2004 ) . Liquid plasma dosing is the same as that for FFP and FP24. Additional recommendations in the literature are that liquid plasma should be used in conjunction with either thawed FFP or FP24 and limited to a shelf life less than 15 days. A study by Gosselin et al. demonstrated signifi cant drops in the levels of FV, FVIII, vWF, protein S, and endogenous thrombin activity (the thrombin generation potential of the product) at 30 days (Gosselin et al. 2013 ) . Because of the decreased levels of both clotting and antithrombotic factors, liquid plasma is recommended only for massive transfusion support in patients with life-threatening hemorrhage and signifi cant coagulation factor defi ciencies (AABB 2013a ).",

A single 10-15 mL cryoprecipitate unit is enriched in high-molecular-weight proteins including vWF, FVIII, fi brinogen, fi bronectin, and FXIII (AABB 2013a ). Further details including the variability of these levels can be found in the individual references (Downes et al. 2001 ; Yazer et al. 2008 ; Gosselin et al. 2013 ; Yazer et al. 2010 ) Cryoprecipitate is stored at \u221218\u00b0 C or below, and preparation time prior transfusion includes 30 min or more to thaw and pool individual units into one dose. Unlike plasma, cryoprecipitate cannot be stored in a thawed form and causes the longest preparation delay when used as a component of a massive transfusion protocol. Cryoprecipitate administration in adults does not need to be ABO compatible; however, the transfusion of large volumes of ABO-incompatible cryoprecipitate in to any single recipient may cause positive direct antiglobulin test results and, rarely, mild hemolysis (Dzik et al. 2011 ; Nascimento et al. 2011 ) .

            "text": "Cryoprecipitate was originally developed as a FVIII concentrate for the treatment of hemophilia A, but the availability of safer, purifi ed, or recombinant FVIII concentrates has largely supplanted its use in these patients. The primary indication for cryoprecipitate in modern transfusion practice is as a fi brinogen concentrate (Callum et al. 2009 ). Cryoprecipitate is the most frequently used fi brinogen concentrate in the USA and is the only one approved for use in the USA for treatment of acquired fi brinogen defi ciency such as surgical blood loss, trauma, or postpartum hemorrhage. Pasteurized fi brinogen concentrates are increasingly replacing cryoprecipitate for treatment of both congenital and acquired fi brinogen defi ciencies (Franchini and Lippi 2012 ; Kozek-Langenecker et al. 2013 ; Wikkelso et al. 2013 ). In the USA, each unit of cryoprecipitate is expected to contain >80 IU FVIII and >150 mg fi brinogen, with typical adult doses ranging from 6 to 10 pooled units. The following formula is recommended for calculating cryoprecipitate dosage: body weight (in kg) \u00d7 0.2 = number of cryoprecipitate units to raise fi brinogen by 50-100 mg/dL (AABB 2013a ). Therapeutic recovery of transfused fi brinogen from cryoprecipitate may be reduced by consumption in ongoing hemorrhage or fi brinolysis. A recent retrospective review of plasma fi brinogen increments following cryoprecipitate transfusion in the setting of trauma found a mean increase of 55 mg/dL after an average transfusion of 8.7 units (\u00b11.7) (Stanworth 2007 ) . Cryoprecipitate remains a second-line therapy for von Willebrand disease and hemophilia A, as well as bleeding secondary to uremia (Hedges et al. 2007 ). Additionally, the 2013 European Society for Anaesthesia perioperative bleeding guidelines suggest that the use of cryoprecipitate for the treatment of hypofi brinogenemia is indicated if fi brinogen concentrates are not available (Kozek-Langenecker et al. 2013 ) .",

Platelets also have the shortest shelf life of any transfused product: the time from collection to expiration is 5 days; attempts to extend the approved storage time have failed (Dumont et al. 2010 ). This is due in part to the relatively short functional life of platelets (7-10 days in the circulation) but also to the risks of bacterial proliferation due to storage at room temperature (Palavecino et al. 2010 ).",

The highest risk ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions are those from group O single donor products administered to group A or B recipients, due to the tendency of group O individuals to form high titer anti-A and anti-B antibodies (Chambers and Herman 1999 ) . Lastly, although platelets do not bear RhD antigens, trace red blood cell content in platelet products has driven the practice of transfusing RhD-negative donor platelets to RhD-negative recipients to avoid alloimmunization. Should inventory shortages necessitate transfusion of RhD-positive platelets to RhD-negative recipients-particularly women of child-bearing age or female pediatric patients with child-bearing potentialtreatment with anti-RhD immunoglobulin is recommended to avoid RhD alloimmunization (British Committee for Standards in Haematology 2012 ).",

Therapeutic platelet transfusion in the context of massive transfusion or DIC should be administered with the aim of keeping the recipient's platelet count at >50 \u00d7 10 9 /L (British Committee for Standards in Haematology 2012 ). The transfusion of one unit of platelets typically increases platelet count by 20\u221240 \u00d7 10 9 /L. The majority (86 %) of platelets are given to patients with hematologic malignancies; 68 % are given for bleeding prophylaxis and 32 % to treat acute bleeding episodes (McCullough et al. 1988 ). Other indications include dilutional thrombocytopenia after massive transfusion, qualitative platelet disorders, rare congenital disorders of platelet function such as Glanzmann thrombasthenia, or drug-induced platelet dysfunction. Aspirin-, clopidogrel-, abciximab-, or prasugrel-related platelet dysfunction should respond to platelet transfusion although high circulating plasma levels of eptifi batide or clopidogrel also render transfused platelets dysfunctional (Vilahur et al. 2007 ) . Little data are available for ticagrelor, but due to its reversible binding to the P2Y12 receptor, transfused platelets can be inhibited by redistribution of ticagrelor from native to the transfused platelets.",

Existing and emerging infectious agents are of greatest local or regional importance in endemic areas, but international travel increases exposure to pathogens.

Given the 5-day storage life and the persistent risk of platelet shortage, in September 2005, the FDA trialed the use of 7-day apheresis platelets under the surveillance program PASSPORT to determine the safety of extending the storage life. The study was discontinued early after 2 true-positive cultures were detected in 2,571 day 8 platelets (778/million) (Dumont et al. 2010 ). However, based on risk modeling, overall recipient risk may not have been improved by the reduced inventory caused by withdrawal of 7-day apheresis platelets.

Passive transfer of IgE directed against recipient plasma allergens or other environmental allergens has also been observed. Accordingly, allergic reactions occur most frequently with plasma-rich products (including platelets) but may also occur in plasma-deplete products such as red cell units.

Severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis should be managed in a similar fashion to anaphylaxis from other causes, with administration of epinephrine (with or without other vasopressors as needed) and corticosteroids, maintenance of a patent airway, and volume infusion to maintain hemodynamic stability.

TRALI may also be associated with fever, chills, hypotension, and transient leukopenia. The primary pathophysiologic mechanism is believed to be a reaction between donor anti-leukocyte antibodies and recipient leukocytes, which results in leukocyte activation (Marques et al. 2005 ) , sequestration, and infi ltration into the pulmonary capillary bed (Fung and Silliman 2009 ). Leukocyte activation results in pulmonary microvascular injury and capillary leakage with an infl ux of proteinaceous fl uid into the alveolar space (Bux and Sachs 2007 ) . A \"two-hit\" hypothesis for the pathogenesis of TRALI holds that the fi rst hit is due to recipient neutrophils primed for activation by virtue of the patient's underlying clinical condition. The second hit involves activation of these neutrophils by anti-leukocyte antibodies or biological response modifi ers contained in the transfused product (Silliman 2006 ) .

Although cognate leukocyte antibody-antigen matches are often seen in TRALI cases, their absence does not rule out TRALI (Kopko et al. 2003 ; Stafford-Smith et al. 2010 ) . Careful patient evaluation of suspected TRALI should involve both the clinical team and the transfusion service and include posttransfusion chest x-rays, measures of oxygenation, and evaluation for volume overload. Once TRALI is suspected, the transfusion must be immediately discontinued and the blood bank informed (Su and Kamel 2007 ) . The details of the transfusion workup are beyond the scope of this chapter. Briefl y, following all cases of TRALI and some cases of possible TRALI, the blood bank and the blood collection facility should investigate all donors associated with TRALI or possible TRALI cases for the presence of antihuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) and possibly antihuman neutrophil antigen (HNA) antibodies (Reil et al. 2008 ) . Few laboratories (mostly in Europe) also perform leukocyte cross-matching as part of the evaluation. The extent of these investigations varies depending upon the availability of donor samples (usually not a problem), the availability of neutrophil antibody testing, and the availability of a recipient sample for HLA antigen typing (Kopko et al. 2001 (Kopko et al. , 2003 . A donor with HLA antibodies matching an affected recipient is classifi ed as an implicated donor and is deferred from future plasma apheresis or platelet apheresis donation. If a donor has the highly morbid anti-HNA 3a antibodies, most blood banks will defer the donor from any type of blood donation (Davoren et al. 2003 ) .",

While not all studies support the benefi t of avoiding female plasma , the overwhelming evidence supports the implementation of gender-based policies for reducing TRALI incidence from plasma transfusion. These factors resulted in the implementation of a new TRALI risk mitigation policy during the mid-to late 2000s throughout most of Europe and the USA, in which plasma units were predominantly obtained from male donors, thereby avoiding the transfusion of plasma units from female donors. This policy is feasible for plasma transfusion because the number of plasma units collected from whole blood or apheresis collections meets, or is in excess of, demand. In contrast, this policy is challenging for group AB platelet and plasma components (Reesink et al. 2012 ) , where restriction of units to male donors jeopardizes supply (see Table 10 .3 ). Despite that, in 2013 the AABB announced new TRALI risk mitigation standards requiring high-plasma volume components come from males, females who have not been pregnant, or females who have been tested since their most recent pregnancy to rule out the presence of anti-HLA antibodies, regardless of ABO group. These new standards are to go into effect in 2014 (AABB 2013b ).",

Generally, TRALI is more likely to be associated with fever, hypotension, and exudative pulmonary infi ltrates and less likely to respond to diuresis, whereas TACO is more likely to be associated with volume overload (e.g., positive fl uid balance, elevated jugular venous pressure) or poor cardiac function (e.g., history of congestive heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, or diastolic dysfunction). Similarly, elevated systolic blood pressures near the time of dyspnea onset, cardiomegaly, and/or increased circulating levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal (NT)-pro-BNP support a diagnosis of TACO rather than TRALI (Popovsky 2009 ; Zhou et al. 2005 ; Tobian et al. 2008 ; Li et al. 2009 ; Rice et al. 2011 ; Ely et al. 2001 ). Differentiating TRALI from TACO can be a signifi cant challenge, particularly as both may coexist (Popovsky 2009 (Popovsky , 2010 Gajic et al. 2006 ). Related to this, approximately 30 % of ALI/ARDS patients show evidence of left atrial hypertension (Wheeler et al. 2006 ) , increasing the diffi culties of differential diagnosis and explaining a degree of diuretic responsiveness associated with TRALI.",
