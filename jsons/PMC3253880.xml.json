First, the genetics of the Drosophila are relatively simple. Drosophila contains fewer genes than humans, indicating less overall genetic redundancy. This allows for a simpler analysis when studying the effects of genes on biological processes (Dimova and Dyson, 2005, Zhang et al., 2007). Second, these model organisms can be genetically modified and propagated quickly. The developmental time of Drosophila ranges from about one to three weeks and is dependent on temperature and other environmental conditions. The entire lifespan is approximately one month in length. In addition, female flies can produce hundreds of offspring within a couple of weeks, and those offspring become sexually mature within the first day of adulthood, enabling the life cycle to start over once again. They are also convenient to grow in the lab due to their small size and simple diet. Hence, large numbers of flies can be maintained inexpensively in the laboratory. Third, the action of viral genes can be studied in the context of whole Drosophila tissues in vivo, which more closely models the cellular environment of viral infection. This is particularly valuable because the effects of the virus at different stages of development can be explored.",

            "text": "Despite its many advantages, there are some limitations of using Drosophila as a system to model human biology. First, there are physiological differences between Drosophila and humans. For example, the optimal temperature for culturing fruit flies is between 18 \u00b0C and 27 \u00b0C. On the other hand, the average body temperature of a human is approximately 37 \u00b0C. Human viruses may be adapted for optimal function at 37 \u00b0C, so some viral proteins may be unable to function properly at temperatures lower than normal body human temperature. Second, genetic differences between Drosophila and humans may pose a challenge to using flies for studying some human viruses. Since genomic conservation is not comprehensive between humans and fruit flies some genes found in humans are absent in the Drosophila genome, which could make it difficult to study some viruses that may require host factors that are not found in Drosophila cells. Finally, there are also biochemical differences between Drosophila and humans. For example, the influenza virus binds to a sialic acid residue on the surface of human cells during infection. One study required that the influenza virus be modified using a different viral coat protein to aid it in infecting Drosophila cells, since these insect cells lacked the sialic acid necessary for viral entry (Hao et al., 2008). However, once inside the cell these viral genes are expressed and appear to function similarly to when they are inside of human cells.",

Furthermore, an alternative to altering viral coat proteins to allow infection would be to introduce viral genes into Drosophila cells through transfection or transgenesis. However, rather than remaining a standalone system to study viral mechanisms, Drosophila may be most beneficial as a tool to rapidly screen the in vivo function of viral genes followed by complementary studies with mammalian cells.",

In this system a gene of interest is constructed so that its expression is under the control of the upstream activating sequence (UAS), which is activated by binding of the GAL4 transcription factor (Fig. 1\n). Drosophila expression vectors are available to insert any gene of interest for the generation of transgenic flies and can efficiently accommodate genes greater than 5 kb in size. In addition, there are publicly available fly stocks for hundreds of different inducible or tissue-specific GAL4 transgenes, which permit precise control over transgene expression. Adult flies carrying a UAS-linked transgene are mated to flies carrying a GAL4 driver, producing progeny containing both elements of the system. The GAL4 gene can then induce expression of the gene of interest in a predictable pattern in the organism. Transcription of the target gene requires the presence of GAL4, so in its absence the gene of interest remains silent in cells that do not express GAL4. One advantage of this system is the ability to study toxic or lethal gene products by restricting transgene expression to cells in non-essential tissues like the eye or wing (Duffy, 2002).",

First, it is important that these genes are expressed at sufficient levels in Drosophila cells, since the level of transgene expression can have a significant effect on phenotypes. A single transgene is sometimes not sufficient to produce a phenotype or produces a weak phenotype with low penetrance. However, GAL4 activity is temperature sensitive, so raising the rearing temperature of the flies a few degrees can enhance expression (Duffy, 2002). Such a shift in temperature may also have a positive effect on the activity of human viral proteins, since these typically function under the higher physiological temperature of the human body. Furthermore, stronger expression through an increase of the transgene copy number can also help to generate a phenotype (Asano and Wharton, 1999, Hong et al., 2008). However, improved expression vectors for making transgenic flies have been generated that increase transgene expression several fold over previous constructs, which in some cases will eliminate the need to combine multiple copies of transgenes to boost expression (Pfeiffer et al., 2010).",

The D. melanogaster genome shows a preference for particular codons compared to other organisms, a phenomenon called codon bias, and it is presumed that genes that encode proteins using rare codons will be translated at a slower rate. In other words, a gene that expresses well in one host species may express poorly in a different species, so using codon optimization for the target species may improve translation efficiency. Indeed, codon optimization of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) for expression in Drosophila resulted in a 50% increase in EGFP production compared to the standard coding sequence (Pfeiffer et al., 2010). Codon optimized gene sequences can be generated in-house through site-directed mutagenesis, or alternatively they can be commercially synthesized de novo.",

Through the use of genetic modifier screens, the function of 3a was also linked to other cellular processes, including calcium regulation, ubiquitination, and transcription (Wong et al., 2005). A subsequent report studied structure\u2013function relationships of the 3a protein using a combination of experiments with human cell culture and transgenic Drosophila (Chan et al., 2009). Importantly, pharmaceutical blockage of the 3a ion channel activity prevents its ability to induce apoptosis both in vitro (human cells) and in vivo (transgenic Drosophila). Another study using transgenic flies showed that the SARS-CoV membrane (M) protein induces apoptosis in the eye by suppressing survival signaling pathways (Chan et al., 2007). Thus, research in Drosophila has identified novel cellular targets that may be useful for future research to discover drugs that control the activity of these SARS-CoV proteins, leading to treatments that could alleviate symptoms and limit the spread of this disease.",

Using RNA interference to target cellular factors involved in protein trafficking, it was revealed that Nef-dependent CD4 downregulation required a specific interaction with AP2, a complex involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but not other AP complexes. This discovery was followed up using HeLa cells where it was shown that the Nef-AP2 interaction is functionally conserved in humans. Another study used transgenic Drosophila to show that Nef expression in larval wing discs also caused apoptosis through activation of the conserved JNK signaling pathway (Lee et al., 2005). In addition, Nef expression negatively affected the Drosophila immune system by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling in fat body cells.

Another study demonstrated that expression of Tat protein in the Drosophila ovary showed nucleolar localization (Ponti et al., 2008).

For example, a comparison of the functional differences between genes of the different strains could help to uncover what makes one strain more pathogenic than another.

In this illustrated example, the offspring has a GAL4 gene under control of the actin promoter, which expresses GAL4 ubiquitously throughout development. GAL4 then binds to UAS and turns on the viral gene in all cells that express GAL4. If expression had to be targeted to a specific subset of cells, then a different GAL4 line would be used to restrict viral gene expression to specific tissues.
