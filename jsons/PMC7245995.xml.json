It would reduce pulmonary stress and strain by reducing the overdistension of aerated non-dependent zones while allowing recruitment of atelectatic dependent zones [7\u201310]. The compliance of the respiratory system would increase [11] despite a decrease in the compliance of the chest wall [12].

Otherwise the return to the supine position was made after at least 16 h, if PaO2/FiO2 > 150 and if the staff was completely available. Prone position therapy was stopped when PaO2/FiO2 remained above 150 in SP. Mechanical ventilation was delivered in a controlled ventilation mode, either in volume or in pressure. Expiratory tidal volume (VTe) had to be adjusted between 5 and 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight. PEEP was set to achieve an end-inspiratory plateau pressure (Pplat) between 28 and 30 cmH2O (or more if an esophageal pressure probe was used to titrate PEEP according to inspiratory and/or expiratory transpulmonary pressure) [26].

Pulmonary mechanics, data from volumetric capnography and arterial blood gas were recorded before prone positioning, 2 h after proning, before return in SP and 2 h after return in SP. Static values were recorded and calculated at these steady-state periods. Additionally end-tidal CO2 pressure (PetCO2), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), VTe, physiological Bohr dead space (VD/VT-phy) and phase 3 slope of the volumetric capnography (SIII) were recorded before proning and every 30 min during the PP session (until 24 h of PP). SIII of volumetric capnography is a plateau phase corresponding to the emptying of the alveolar compartment. The more flat the slope (i.e., close to 0), the more the alveoli have a simultaneous emptying and an identical CO2 concentration (therefore similar ventilation/perfusion ratios). The increase in the slope will thus be associated with a desynchronization of the alveolar emptying and/or an increase in the inhomogeneity of the ventilation/perfusion ratios [27]. Dynamic driving pressure (\u0394Pdyn) was calculated by VTe/Cdyn.",

Mann\u2013Whitney and Fisher exact tests were used to compare patients\u2019 characteristics according to their vital status on hospital discharge. We also performed multivariate logistic regression analyses with mortality as the dependent variable. We analyzed data from the first PP session and the effect on the main responding physiological parameters for each patient.

            "text": "It has already been shown that the oxygenation gain estimated by the PaO2/FiO2 was not associated with a reduction in mortality thanks to PP [30]. It is the same for all the other parameters studied here, although previous studies have found potentially prognostic parameters such as the decrease in PaCO2 [31, 32] or alveolar dead space [32]. These results are in fact logical if one relies on the mechanism of action of prone positioning, which consists of a reduction of the VILI. PP reduces lung stress and strain by reducing the overdistention of anterior non-dependent zones while allowing recruitment of posterior dependent zones [7\u20139, 13, 14]. Lung expansion is more constant and homogeneous [10, 15, 16]. It should therefore be considered that putting on PP is an integral part of protective ventilation techniques such as reducing the VT. In the same way that the use of reduced current volumes should be applied until a significant improvement in ARDS allowing the reintroduction of spontaneous ventilation, PP sessions should probably be extended to a similar time. It has, again recently, been shown that the recruitment of posterior lung zones depends on the duration of positioning [33]. In our study the beneficial effect continued to increase after at least 24 h. Interestingly, the PROSEVA study [6], the only positive randomized controlled trial, was the only one that did not stop PP therapy after a pre-established period, but continued until a significant (PaO2/FiO2 > 150 in SP) and persistent (> 4 h) improvement occurred. It would seem reasonable to continually leave patients in PP until the overall improvement of their condition allows sedation to be stopped and spontaneous ventilation to resume. Rather than repeating the sessions, it would probably be better to extend the sessions. The beneficial effect is linked to the length spent in PP, not to the maneuver per se. Also, complications during turning maneuvers are rare in experienced teams, but probably more frequent in the smallest centers. If our study did not allow us to predict a benefit in extending the sessions for more than 24 h, it nevertheless invited us to make them last at least 24 h. It also does not seem logical to interrupt sessions, whose initiation was motivated by a PaO2/FiO2 of less than 150, if this PaO2/FiO2 remains below 150 after 24 h. Therefore, we suggest that the PP sessions last at least 24 h and be extended in the event that the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 h remains below 150.",

            "text": "Preventing ventilation-induced injuries is crucial for the future of patients with ARDS. Most of these patients die, while still on mechanical ventilation, but rarely with refractory hypoxemia [34]. It is mainly the overcomplications, the sequelae of the causal disease and the maintenance of pulmonary lesions by the mechanical ventilation which prolong the duration of invasive ventilation and are responsible for the mortality. PP should not be used as a rescue, but as a routine therapy in ARDS patients. Yet a multicenter study in 2017 found that the prevalent reason for not using PP was that hypoxemia was not considered sufficiently severe [35]. Future studies should focus on researching the benefit of PP in all ARDS patients regardless of the severity stage. There were no life-threatening complications in our cohort and they are described as rare [6, 35]. The benefit/risk balance is therefore strongly in favor of the PP in moderate-to-severe ARDS. It should be evaluated in the mild-to-moderate ARDS. Of course, the PP session could be interrupted in the event of a serious complication or urgent care.",

These lasted 21.5 \u00b1 5 h (20.7\u201322) and there was no difference in duration between surviving patients and deaths (respectively, 20.8 \u00b1 3 h vs 21.1 \u00b1 6.5; p = 0.719) (Tables S1, S2 and S3, Additional file 1). In the same way, some modifications of the ventilators\u2019 settings were allowed (RR and PEEP). This could partially explain the improvement in some studied parameters. As Tables S1, S2 and S3, Additional file 1 show, these changes may be statistically significant but are not clinically relevant. They cannot explain the observed evolution of physiological parameters by themselves. The design of the study does not allow, without a control group, to affirm that the physiological effects studied are solely due to PP and not to the evolution of the disease. Especially since part of the effect is \u201clost\u201d after the return to SP. This effect is really related to PP for PaO2/FiO2 [6], for pH and RR (therefore for PaCO2) [4] and therefore also for the other studied parameters that evolved very significantly over short periods.",

Finally, the hemodynamic impact of PP has not been studied except via VCO2-min and P(a-et)CO2. Indeed our study found an association between mortality and low CO2 production. It was probably linked to a defect in cellular perfusion from circulatory failure. 101 (98.1%) of the patients were on vasopressors. This aspect is probably major, at least in patients with acute cor pulmonale [37, 38]. More studies are needed on this topic. In addition, the volumetric capnography data are significantly affected by the hemodynamic state of the patient, which makes their interpretation more difficult.",

Therefore, we suggest that the PP sessions last at least 24 h and be extended in the event that the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 h remains below 150. In the event of a relapse of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 150 after putting back in supine position, a new session of at least 24 h of PP should be carried out, and so on until the moment of deciding to stop sedation and resume spontaneous ventilation. PP should be integrated into the protective ventilation of moderate-to-severe ARDS in the same way as the reduction in tidal volume.",
