            "text": "Background: The literature is ripe with phylogenetic estimates of nucleotide substitution rates, especially of measurably evolving species such as RNA viruses. However, it is not known how robust these rate estimates are to inaccuracies in the data, particularly in sampling dates that are used for molecular clock calibration. Here we report on the rate of evolution of the emerging pathogen Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which has significantly different rates of evolution for the same outer capsid (VP60) gene published in the literature. In an attempt to reconcile the conflicting data and further elucidate details of RHDV 's evolutionary history, we undertook fresh Bayesian analyses and employed jackknife control methods to produce robust substitution rate and time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimates for RHDV based on the VP60 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. Results: Through these control methods, we were able to identify a single misdated taxon, a passaged lab strain used for vaccine production, which was responsible for depressing the RHDV capsid gene's rate of evolution by 65%. Without this isolate, the polymerase and the capsid protein genes had nearly identical rates of evolution: 1.90x10 -3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year, ns/s/y, (95% highest probability density (HPD) 1.25x10 -3 -2.55x10 -3 ) and 1.91x10 -3 ns/s/y (95% HPD 1.50x10 -3 -2.34x10 -3 ), respectively. Conclusions: After excluding the misdated taxon, both genes support a significantly higher substitution rate as well as a relatively recent emergence of RHDV, and obviate the need for previously hypothesized decades of unobserved diversification of the virus. The control methods show that using even one misdated taxon in a large dataset can significantly skew estimates of evolutionary parameters and suggest that it is better practice to use smaller datasets composed of taxa with unequivocal isolation dates. These jackknife controls would be useful for future tip-calibrated rate analyses that include taxa with ambiguous dates of isolation.",

Not surprisingly, there is also significant variation among the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimates for RHDV, with estimated mean coalescent ranging from 1917 [12] to 1967 [13] . As RHD was first described in 1984 [12, [14] [15] [16] 25] , the oldest TMRCA implies that the coalescent of virulent RHDV antedates the emergence of RHD by almost seven decades. In the absence of an intermediate reservoir host, it is uncommon for the emergence of an acute, virulent virus to be so extensively decoupled from the appearance of its associated disease [3, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . As a result, there has been significant debate over the timing, location, and mechanisms of RHDV 's emergence [12, 14, 15, 25, 32, 33] .",

As this range of evolutionary rates is atypical for a gene of a single viral species, a systematic investigation was undertaken to explain variation among published nucleotide substitution rate and TMRCA estimates for RHDV. A combination of jackknifing controls was used to produce robust rate estimates for the VP60 gene and the first estimated substitution rate for RHDV 's RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. These controls reveal that using one misdated taxon significantly slows the estimated rates, unnecessarily lengthening RHDV 's TMRCA. We demonstrate the fragility of tip-calibrated evolutionary analyses and propose jackknife control BEAST runs as a way to identify potential misdated taxa.",

In the context of RHDV in particular, seven partial VP60 sequences were identified as misdated modern contaminants by maximum likelihood analysis [12] , but were nonetheless included in one BEAST analysis [9] , resulting in the slowest substitution rate published for RHDV. It has also been suspected for some time that certain taxa could have a strong influence over inferred phylogenies, and a number of methods have been developed to identify weak clades in phylogenetic trees [44] [45] [46] [47] or the highly influential taxa responsible for weakening phylogenetic relationships [48] . However, there is currently no direct method for identifying the presence of a taxon, such as AY269825, that has significant influence over evolutionary rate and TMRCA estimates, Figure 4 Violin plots displaying AY269825's influence on estimated substitution rates (A) and years of emergence (B) for RHDV. Both plots are based on the mean rates and TMRCA from the VP60 jackknife analysis results. For each plot, datasets represented on the left included AY269825 (\"+AY269825\"), while datasets represented on the right did not (\"-AY269825\"). Black rectangles and lines indicate the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of each group of data, respectively, while the shading demonstrates the probability density of each group. Figure 5 RHDV nucleotide substitution rates estimated from the VP60 \"n-1\" jackknife datasets. Mean substitution rates are shown with 95% HPD intervals for each of the 65 datasets. Each rate estimate is identified on the x-axis by the GenBank accession number and year of isolation of the taxon removed from its dataset. Estimates produced from datasets that included AY269825 are shown in red, while the dataset that excluded AY269825 is shown in blue.",

The first paragraph of the methods section (see translation below) revealed that, though it was isolated from nature in 1985, it was maintained in the laboratory for vaccine preparation and was likely not sequenced until much later. The 2003 submission date of AY269825 to GenBank is concordant with the lower bound of the age estimated by the leaf-dating method, as well as its grouping with isolates from 2006-2009 in the MCC and ML trees (Figure 1 ). \"RHDV NJ85 strain isolate was discovered and characterized byInstitute of Veterinary medicine, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences (JAAS), from rabbits raised in an unknown farm in Nanjing City, China, in 1985.

This underscores the problem of using congruence with a strict molecular clock as the sole means of assessing the validity of dates of isolation. Deviation from the root-to-tip regression line is expected for viruses with variable rates of evolution, which would be accurately modeled with a relaxed molecular clock BEAST analysis [11, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . Indeed, correlation between genetic distance and time was stronger for the VP60 dataset including the misdated AY269825 taxon than the RdRp dataset, which produced a more trustworthy substitution rate (r = 0.76 compared to r = 0.70). The decision to include or exclude taxa based on residuals from a best-fitting line is largely subjective, as there are no guidelines for how common large residuals are in tip-dated viral datasets. In fact, one of the AY269825-containing RHDV datasets had been subjected to this control prior to rate analysis, and the authors did not reject it as an outlier [12] . Finally, rootto-tip regression provides no insight into the magnitude of effect of any taxon on evolutionary estimates. The jackknife controls proposed here focus on detecting taxa that have had a disproportionate effect on the BEAST results, and, in the case of RHDV, offered strong quantitative evidence against including AY269825.",

Even while the RdRp dataset did not have as strong a temporal signal (Additional file 3), probably due to the lower number of taxa, it still produced a significantly more accurate substitution rate estimate than datasets with two to three times as many taxa that included just one misdated taxon (Table 1) . Further, the estimated substitution rate from our VP60 RHDV + RCV dataset was nearly identical to that from another dataset which contained just 29 taxa (27 RHDV, 1 RCV, did not contain AY269825), including one distantly related European brown hare syndrome virus taxon as an outgroup [13] . This pattern of different sized datasets producing very similar substitution rates is not unique to RHDV. For example, two BEAST analyses of Dengue virus type 2 from datasets of 115 taxa and 67 taxa yielded nearly identical substitution rates [58, 59] . Further, in the case of Human parechovirus, three BEAST analyses of three different genomic regions based on datasets with a range of 29-199 taxa also produced nearly identical substitution rates [55, 60] .",

These results support favoring data sets with fewer taxa with verifiable dates of isolation over larger data sets with less quality control: additional good data do not swamp out the effects of one badly dated taxon. When researchers are including any ambiguously dated taxa, or when they want to be certain about the effects of each taxon on the rate analysis, jackknife controls provide a clear way to see these effects. As many sequences are added to GenBank without easily accessible papers describing in detail the isolation, passaging and sequencing of each isolate, it is necessary to verify if one or more of the sequences is having a disproportionate influence on the results. We propose n-1 jackknifing as one method for researchers using tip-calibrated analyses in BEAST to ensure that a small number of taxa are not spoiling their estimates.",

            "text": "In the first attempt to identify if certain taxa were responsible for the substantial variation in published RHDV rate estimates based on the VP60 gene, the complete VP60 dataset (RHDV-only, 65 taxa) was used to generate 50 smaller datasets, each containing 30 taxa selected using a random number generator (Microsoft Excel, 2008) . Each of these jackknifed datasets was run in BEAST, as described above, with the same best-fitting priors from the full dataset. In a parallel analysis, the 31 RdRp taxa were jackknifed into 30 independent subsets of 15 taxa each (exact taxa used for jackknife analyses available in Additional file 7). These smaller datasets were run until all parameters had stable ESS values (>200). Similarity between the mean estimated rates was determined visually by plotting the mean and 95% HPDs and by using the data to generate violin plots (violinmplot package in R [69, 70] ).To further assess the effect of each individual taxon on substitution rate estimates, a jackknife \"n-1\" analysis was performed in which 65 datasets were generated from the complete VP60 dataset, each with one taxon removed. Each of these n-1 datasets was then run in BEAST, as described above with the same best-fitting priors from the full dataset. Whether a taxon had a statistically significant effect on substitution rate was determined by non-overlapping 95% HPD intervals with those from the complete VP60 dataset and from the other n-1 jackknife runs. An equivalent n-1 jackknife analysis was also performed on the RdRp dataset.Any taxon identified as exerting a significant effect on a rate estimate was considered potentially misdated, and the method of leaf-dating via BEAST [71] was employed to determine a more accurate estimate of the suspect taxon's age. Further, any such taxon was subsequently removed from the complete datasets, and the complete dataset analyses described above were repeated for the datasets without the suspect taxon.",
