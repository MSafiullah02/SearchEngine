Many of these efficient and not at all primitive defenses are evolutionarily old and can be found in all metazoans.

They are produced by immune and epithelial cells, and are present on epithelia and in body fluids. On top of their basic expression levels they are induced by viral infection. Their common antimicrobial function is the formation of destructive pores in membranes of pathogens including enveloped viruses. Defensins can however also block infection by enveloped and non-enveloped viruses alike by aggregating the particles, blocking receptor binding, inhibiting virus entry or particle uncoating, interfere with essential cell signaling or viral gene expression, or act by other, ill-understood mechanisms. Moreover, defensins were shown to attract immune cells and modulate adaptive immune responses.",

Complement activation is achieved by specific receptors recognizing pathogens or immunocomplexes. Three different pathways are being distinguished which are termed the classical pathway (triggered by antigen\u2013antibody complexes), the mannan-binding lectin pathway (triggered by lectin binding of pathogen surfaces), and the alternative pathway (triggered by complement factor C3b-coated pathogen surfaces). They all activate a cascade of reactions involving more than 20 soluble and cell-bound proteins, thus resulting in a rapid and massive response. The complement system is able to (1) tag infected cells and pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells (opsonization), (2) prime humoral immune responses, and (3) perforate membranes of infected cells by the membrane-attack complex. In response, viruses have evolved effective countermeasures such as incorporation of cellular complement-regulatory proteins into particles or expressing specific inhibitors in infected cells.",

Granulocytes are also able to remove viral particles and apoptotic bodies by phagocytosis. They are rapidly attracted to inflammatory sites and enter the tissue by transendothelial migration.

These specialized immune cells sample antigen at the site of infection, activate themselves and the surrounding tissue cells by cytokine synthesis, and then migrate to secondary lymphatic organs in order to mobilize T cells against the presented antigen. The differentiation into efficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is achieved by cytokine production which, in turn, is triggered by stimulation of receptors recognizing pathogen-specific molecular patterns (PAMPs). Two main types of DCs are being distinguished: myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). mDCs are an early split-off of the myeloid bone marrow precursors, that is, the stem cells which are also giving birth to macrophages/monocytes and granulocytes, among others. Depending on the location, several subsets of mDCs such as Langerhans cells or interstitial cells are being distinguished. pDCs, which are not segregated into subpopulations, are thought to be derived from lymphatic precursor cells. Both mDCs and pDCs can sense viral infection by several intra- and extracellular PAMP receptors (see below). Depending on the DC type, high levels of interleukins or IFNs are being produced which coin the subsequent immune reaction. pDCs are potent producers of the main antiviral cytokines, the type I IFNs.",

Classes of virus-triggered PRRs can be divided into the endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) and various intracellular (mostly cytoplasmic) receptors. Although the viral genome is protected by a nucleocapsid and often a lipid envelope, it is thought that a fraction of the virus particles (or endocytosed remnants of infected cells) gets lysed by the endosomal low pH and/or degradative enzymes to release the viral nucleic acids. Major PAMPs are double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), 5\u2019-triphosphorylated (ppp) RNAs, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). dsRNA and 5\u2019ppp-RNA are not present in uninfected cells, thus predestining them as a immunorelevant markers of non-self. In the case of ssRNA and dsDNA, it is thought that unusual locations (e.g. endosome or cytoplasm for DNA), a lack of cell-typical modifications (e.g. methylation), or specific secondary structures are responsible for triggering antiviral responses. Moreover it should be noted that a full-blown infection converts the heterogeneous population of cellular nucleic acids into a pool of largely homogeneous, highly abundant viral molecules. Thus immunogenicity could also be caused by over-representation of uniform RNA or DNA species.",

To date, only a fraction of these antiviral pathways has been studied in great detail, for example the 2\u2019\u20135\u2019 OAS/RNaseL system, ISG20, the Mx proteins, the RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR 1), the protein kinase R (PKR), and IFN-induced tetratricopeptide repeat (IFIT) protein 1. 2\u2019\u20135\u2019 OAS, ADAR, and PKR are constitutively expressed in normal cells in a latent, inactive form. Basal mRNA levels are upregulated by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and these enzymes need to be activated by viral dsRNA. The 2\u2019\u20135\u2019 OAS catalyzes the synthesis of short 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylates that activate the latent endoribonuclease RNaseL. RNaseL degrades both viral and cellular RNAs, leading to virus inhibition. ADAR 1 catalyzes the deamination of adenosine on target dsRNAs to yield inosine. As a result the secondary structure is destabilized due to a change from an AU base pair to the less stable IU base pair and mutations accumulate within the viral genome. PKR is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates \u2013 among other substrates \u2013 the \u03b1-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 to block translation of cellular and viral mRNAs. PKR also plays a role in virus-induced NF-\u03baB activation, as described above. ISG20 is an exonuclease that degrades viral ssRNA. IFIT1 is expressed at extremely high levels after IFN stimulation or PRR signaling and sequesters viral RNA with a 5\u2019ppp end or an unmethylated cap.

            "text": "Given the massive direct and indirect antiviral effects of type I IFNs, it comes as no surprise that viruses had evolved efficient countermeasures. In fact, most viruses investigated so far were found to actively inhibit either IFN induction, IFN signaling, antiviral ISG action, or combinations thereof. A common strategy to avoid IFN induction seems to be the targeting of treacherous dsRNA or 5\u2019ppp structures by binding, modifying or degradation through viral factors, the so-called IFN antagonists. Moreover, many viral features such as encapsidating genomic RNA by nucleoprotein (negative-strand RNA viruses), hiding replication complexes in intracellular membrane enclosures (positive-strand RNA viruses) or multiple protein sheets (dsRNA viruses), as well as replicating in the nucleus (orthomyxoviruses) can be regarded as passive strategies to minimize generation and exposure of PAMPs to PRRs. Active strategies include sequestration or proteasomal degradation of key factors of antiviral signaling like PRRs, kinases, IRFs, STATs or even RNA polymerase II itself. The bundle of these measures, i.e. the individual anti-IFN profile of a particular virus, can represent a major marker for host range, cell tropism, and virulence. Weak anti-IFN capabilities would render a virus unfit in a given host, whereas strong IFN suppression enables productive replication. However, while this might be a rule of thumb for viruses causing acute infections, a different picture is presented in persistent infections. Here, long-term production of IFN is beneficial for the virus as it results in an immunosuppression aimed at limiting immunopathology. Thus, the balance and timing of activation vs. suppression of the IFN response can determine the outcome of infection, ranging from a straight fending off (host wins by early antiviral IFN action) to acute disease (virus wins by suppressing early IFN action) to chronic viral disease (constant IFN levels maintain infection by suppressing immune responses). In any case, the simple equation: strong IFN antagonism = virulent virus, weak IFN antagonism = harmless virus, should be applied with some caution.",

Treatment with IFNs is an established therapy against several viral and malignant diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Kaposi's sarcoma, papillomas, multiple sclerosis, and several leukemias and myelomas. However, the strong and systemic effects of IFNs do not come without a price. Administration of IFN can locally produce inflammation, and systemically cause fever, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, and anemia. It is no coincidence that these latter are \u2018flu-like\u2019 symptoms, since in many acute infections IFNs play a dominant role. The effects of IFN which are desired and beneficial if restricted to the site of first infection can turn into a life-threatening \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 if it becomes systemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and human infections with H5N1 influenza viruses are examples of such out-of-control innate immune responses. Moreover, the effect of long-term IFN levels facilitating persistent infections was discussed above. Another \u2018dark side\u2019 aspect is that patients with autoimmune diseases have chronically elevated levels of IFNs, and that IFN therapy can aggravate autoimmune disorders. It is thought that pDCs (and in part B cells) are autostimulated by self-DNA via TLR9 and by small nuclear RNA complexes (snRNPs) via TLR7.

The fact that basically every virus appears to have evolved one or several countermeasures for controlling the IFN response is testament to its importance. In addition, IFNs are not only antiviral, but also effective tumor suppressors. Tumor cells often eliminate the IFN system during the transformation process. The payoff is an increased susceptibility to infection, an Achilles heel which is exploited by the therapeutic concept of oncolytic viruses. Tumor selectivity of such viruses can be even more increased by using IFN-sensitive mutants. The inability of those mutants to fight the IFN response is complemented by the mutations of the tumor cells, thus allowing virus growth.
