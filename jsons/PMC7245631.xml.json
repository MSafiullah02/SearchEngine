Reducing work of breathing and oxygen consumption to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation, preventing diaphragmatic dysfunction and self-inflicted lung injury are expected benefits of invasive ventilation [2, 3]. Several studies have shown that diaphragmatic dysfunction may occur as early as in the first 4 h of septic shock [4, 5]. On the other hand, arguments to challenge a systematic use of ventilatory support in septic shock include immediate complications of tracheal intubation (including hemodynamic impairment) as well as potential side effects related to ventilation (ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction, muscle atrophy, ventilation-induced lung injuries, and ventilator-associated pneumonia) [6\u20138]. In recent multicenter trials on septic shock patients, the percentage of patients who received invasive ventilation ranged widely from 40 to 80% [9, 10]. In a declarative international survey, 86% of clinicians declared that the decision to initiate invasive ventilation was based on \u201ccommon sense\u201d or \u201chuman physiological data\u201d [11]. Agreement between responders regarding hemodynamic parameters to initiate mechanical ventilation was low, contrary to neurologic and respiratory criteria. In acute neurologic and respiratory failures, indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation are generally well-accepted across studies, based on reliable quantitative parameters (respiratory rate, use of accessory respiratory muscles, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and Glasgow coma score) [12\u201316]. How physicians apply these criteria in septic shock patients and whether other parameters, in particular hemodynamic, are involved is unknown.",

In a monocentric qualitative survey, Bauer et al. analyzed the factors that influenced the decision of early intubation in sepsis-associated respiratory failure. They showed that the decision to intubate was not solely based on clinical parameters, but also on clinician factors like background, experience or instinct and system factors like organizational structure or workload [25].

To take into account the workload requirements and organizational factors of this demanding procedure, we extended to the first 8 h the time frame for defining early tracheal intubation. Missing data were observed in 13% of included patients, which may impact the accuracy of our results. We may have missed some important parameters that should have been considered to explain the decision to intubate. However, the prospective and dedicated design of our study allowed the monitoring of a wide range of baseline and clinical parameters. We may also have missed the adequate time frame during which parameters should have been monitored. In a future study, organizational factors (physician experience, workload, etc.) may be registered.
