Epilepsy, a disease characterized by a spontaneous recurrence of unprovoked seizures, is a common chronic neurological condition. Associations between epilepsy and COVID-19 have not been reported. Here, we discuss the important considerations for epilepsy patients by reviewing known facts of COVID-19 and suggestions from medical societies associated with epilepsy, as well as inferences from past experiences of infectious diseases. We discuss the risk of COVID-19 for epilepsy patients, the effect of COVID-19 on epilepsy patients, and the importance of maintaining seizure control. We also consider suggestions for epilepsy monitoring units or surgery, what caregivers should know, and the importance of public awareness. The effect of COVID-19 on individuals with epilepsy remains unclear due to the lack of enough evidence. Clinicians and researchers need to share case information, continue investigations, and provide known facts to epilepsy patients and their families.",

The second problem is that going to emergency rooms due to increased or uncontrollable seizures could expose the patient to coronavirus. Epilepsy foundation does not recommend going to emergency room unless there is an actual emergency. Finally, uncontrollable seizures, especially status epilepticus, would need sedation and ventilators. However, in clinical settings at regions with many COVID-19 patients, clinicians face the shortage of mechanical ventilators [16] . Increase in the number of patients with status epilepticus would aggravate this problem. Therefore, it is very important to maintain the control of seizures, as well as the prevention of COVID-19. However, visits to doctors and periodic filling of prescriptions account for the greater difficulty encountered by epilepsy patients in avoiding crowded situations. Previous experience with SARS evidently shows that emerging infectious diseases can potentially prevent epilepsy patients from keeping up with their routine appointments [17] . This can be mitigated through the introduction of telemedicine and purchase of prescription medications lasting a minimum of a few J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f months. Telemedicine allows consultations with doctors without exposure to crowded conditions, and thus prevents the spread of COVID-19 among patients. Hence, introduction and implementation of telemedicine should be given further consideration.",

Epileptologists may have good knowledge about the interaction between these medications and AEDs. The Italian League Against Epilepsy provides a table of interactions of these drugs (https://www.lice.it/pdf/Antiepileptic_drugs_interactions_in_COVID-19.pdf). Certain combinations are not recommended or require greater attention to prevent the inductions of critical comorbidities. Levetiracetam is of interest, as it would not cause interactions with any drug. Drug interactions should be taken into consideration when introducing or adding AEDs. Moreover, some medications for supportive treatment such as antihistamine would reduce seizure threshold.",
