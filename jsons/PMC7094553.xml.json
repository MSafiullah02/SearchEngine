Almost 20% of the population of Canada is foreign born.6 More than half (54%) of the migrants living in the United States are from the Americas, with an additional 26% from Asia, 16% from Europe, and 3% from Africa.

Some chronic conditions are associated with remote acquisition of infections, such as American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease (heart and esophageal disease), the parasitic infection cysticercosis (seizure disorders), and hepatitis B and C infection (hepatic cirrhosis). The incidence of some cancers (hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer) in the future may also be affected by the prevalence of infections such as hepatitis B and C and human papillomavirus (HPV) in mobile populations resettling in areas where these infections are less common.",

This concern is especially great when large groups, such as refugees, are resettled to locations around the world. Since 2004, the resettlement of refugee populations has been disrupted in Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, Ethiopia, and Ivory Coast by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases including measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever. The planned movement of 8000 Liberian refugees scheduled to begin in June 2003 and conclude in April 2004 was interrupted several times by outbreaks of varicella, measles, o'nyong-nyong fever, and rubella.15 During this period, 16 cases of varicella were imported into four states and an infant who had congenital rubella infection was born to a mother who had asymptomatic infection.16 Experts in refugee resettlement have proposed immunization of large mobile populations before resettlement to reduce the spread of infectious diseases and to realize a cost-savings compared with administering all vaccines in the destination country.17\n",

Multidrug-resistant TB also occurs more commonly in foreign-born individuals; 84.5% of cases occurred in such individuals in the United States in 2006.38 Since the early 1990s, more than half the cases of TB in Canada have been reported in foreign-born individuals.39 Patterns of TB seen in North America today and those predicted for the future are therefore driven by the trends in immigration now and in the recent past. Currently, more than half of all TB cases in the United States occur in individuals from four countries: Mexico, the Philippines, India, and Vietnam.38 In Canada, most cases are seen in individuals from the Western Pacific region, although increased numbers of cases from Southeast Asia and Africa are being reported.39 TB control programs must take into account the needs of the foreign-born population and make TB diagnosis and prevention programs accessible and acceptable to foreign-born populations.40\n",

They conclude that population migration and immigration could more than double the number of children who have HIV/AIDS in Canada, requiring a refocusing of efforts to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate programs of HIV care and prevention for immigrant families. Health care professionals and HIV program directors face significant challenges in accommodating the needs of diverse immigrant populations. Overcoming language and cultural barriers to care, addressing differing beliefs about HIV/AIDS, providing care in the context of competing priorities such as housing, jobs, and family stress, and addressing the psychiatric needs of immigrants living with HIV are all critical to the success of programs caring for immigrant populations, yet are stretching the resources of these programs in unprecedented ways.44\n",

Relapses of malaria may present long after migration and the diagnosis may seem elusive unless the migration history is known. Lymphatic filariasis may present as intermittent leg swelling, and patients may undergo multiple evaluations for cellulitis or deep venous thrombosis or other conditions unless residence in an area where lymphatic filariasis exists is ascertained. Neurocysticercosis is one of the most common causes of seizures in some immigrant populations; seizures may occur years after leaving the country of exposure. Granulomas formed by Schistosoma may result in long-term complications such as hepatic fibrosis, hydronephrosis, and infertility in women many years after initial exposure. Heart block, cardiomyopathy, or esophageal dilatation may be late manifestations of Chagas' disease. The clinician's challenge for all these diseases is to link these clinical manifestations with a remote exposure occurring outside North America. With the multiple pressures on clinicians today, including decreased time to spend with each patient, increased requirements to complete specific tasks during a visit, and the challenges of caring for patients with limited English/French proficiency and limited health literacy, it is easy to understand how taking a migration history would be missed. Even when migration histories are requested, additional barriers may exist, such as fear of deportation, which may hinder obtaining an accurate history of exposure. This situation was illustrated poignantly by Matteelli and colleagues,46 who described a group of illegal Chinese immigrants to Italy diagnosed with malaria. The circuitous route by which they traveled was obtained only with extreme difficulty partly because of the clandestine status of these immigrants.",

The period of latency between being infected with viruses such as hepatitis B or C, or HPV, and bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori, and development of malignancy may be decades. Diagnoses of hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical and other HPV-related cancers, and gastric cancer made in the next 20 years are likely to be made in the populations of immigrants who arrive already infected with these organisms. Individuals from many regions outside the United States that are the origin of many immigrants are more likely to be infected with hepatitis viruses, HPV, and H pylori than individuals born and raised in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 1994 and 2003, approximately 40,000 immigrants who had chronic hepatitis B were admitted to the United States annually.49 Thus, these infection-related cancers will be emerging diseases in immigrant populations in the future. Efforts toward prevention of transmission of these infections and early diagnosis and treatment of resulting diseases must be made with the populations most at risk in mind. An example of the challenges presented by such a need is the situation with respect to cervical cancer in Vietnamese women in California. Although Vietnamese-American women have the highest rates of cervical cancer of any group in the United States, and are diagnosed later than women in other groups, one report noted that only 50% of them have ever had a Pap smear, compared with almost 98% of women in the general United States population.50 Another example is that of hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma in the Chinese-American population. Approximately 10% of Chinese immigrants are infected with hepatitis B, compared with about 1% of the American-born population. Several reports indicate, however, that fewer than 40% of immigrants from China have been tested for hepatitis B infection. Coronado and colleagues,51 in a study of Chinese immigrants in Seattle, found that factors associated with having been tested included knowledge that Chinese immigrants are more likely than whites to get hepatitis B, being told by a doctor that they needed to be tested or requesting of a health care professional that they be tested, and not needing an interpreter for the visit. The CDC currently recommends screening for hepatitis B all immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Pacific islands, and other areas where high rates of infection with hepatitis B occur, regardless of vaccination status.49 Finally, H pylori, associated with gastric cancer, is more common in individuals born in developing countries than it is in those born in industrialized countries. The implications of this colonization over the long term is unknown.52\n",

An outbreak of Plasmodium vivax malaria involving migrant workers from Mexico was reported from San Diego County, California, in 1986.

The virus is transmitted to humans, horses, and other mammals by mosquitoes, and domestic and wild birds play a critical role in the spread of this disease. The rapid emergence of West Nile virus in the United States and Canada is a wake-up call for the public health community, highlighting that emergence of other mosquito-borne illnesses is a real possibility. The presence in the United States of mosquito populations that are competent to transmit several arboviruses means that viremic individuals entering the United States could potentially spark local transmission.61 It is worth remembering that outbreaks of yellow fever once occurred as far north as Boston, and that malaria occurred throughout much of the United States. Changes in relationships among vectors and intermediate hosts of parasitic diseases and humans as reservoirs of infection are occurring and will continue to occur. On the west coast of the United States, two intermediate hosts of the human lung fluke have appeared since 1990: the Chinese mitten crab in 1990 and the estuarine snail in 2007. These arrivals set the stage for completion of the lung fluke life cycle should sanitary conditions allow the lung fluke, carried by infected Asian immigrants, to enter bodies of water containing both intermediate hosts. At this time, the habitats of the two intermediate hosts do not overlap, but it is likely that they will in the future (James T. Carlton, personal communication, 2008). Human activity is constantly changing the balance among vectors, hosts, and reservoirs of infection; migration of human populations contributes to, and is affected by, changes in this balance.",

Public health officials are challenged by the extent of activities required to monitor the spread of such diseases and implement measures to limit or prevent them. Clinicians are challenged by the need to be familiar with new and emerging infections and by the need to consider migration history for a growing number of individuals. Addressing the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases related to migration will require increased surveillance of infectious disease patterns worldwide, increased knowledge by health care professionals of a wider variety of infectious diseases and attention to migration patterns of their patients, and a high index of suspicion on the part of clinicians when faced with unfamiliar illnesses.",
