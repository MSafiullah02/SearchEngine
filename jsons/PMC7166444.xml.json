The activation of the pyrin domain\u2010containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome triggers this cytokine production. In addition, type I and type III interferons are secreted to block virus replication by infected as well as by plasmatocytoid DCs. At the same time, B cells secrete antibodies to mediate the adaptive immune response.2 The end result is either host resistance or tolerance promoting tissue repair.2\n",

Besides the clinical syndrome, the duration and extent of this inflammatory response may lead to further pathology at the local tissue level. Although not clearly associated with viral infections, Th17 cells may play an important role in maintaining the mucosal barrier and contributing to pathogen clearance at mucosal surfaces. There is limited available knowledge of the role of the interleukin\u201017 pathway in the response of the human host to a respiratory virus infection. In experimental models, Th17 cytokines have been proposed to be associated with modulation of inflammation and may be beneficial in clearance of influenza infection.4 However, others have suggested a potential role in increasing disease related severity in animal models.5 Limited data have suggested an association of an exaggerated systemic Th1 and Th17 response in severe disease with respiratory involvement in patients suffering from pandemic influenza caused by the AH1N1pdm09 strain.6\n",

Pharyngeal swab specimens were taken from 76 consecutive patients (outpatients) who presented to the ER, with symptoms of respiratory tract infection (headache or malaise accompanied by either cough, sore throat, or nasal congestion with or without fever). Samples were collected on every call day of the hospital (every 4 days) during the period of 24 October 2014 to 2 April 2015. Basic clinical and epidemiological characteristics were collected through a structured case report form. A nasopharyngeal swab was stored in Thin Prep CytoL solution (Cytyc Corporation, Malborough, MA) and was immediately sent to the laboratory for analysis. The CLART PneumoVir kit, (GENOMICA, Spain) was used for viral detection of all known respiratory viruses according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 400 \u03bcL of Thin Prep CytoLyt (Cytyc Corporation, Boxborough, MA) solution using the MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher, Foster City, CA) and eluted in 50 \u03bcL elution buffer. The Thin Prep CytoL solution, from each clinical sample, was centrifuged at 2000g for 5 minutes and 20 to 40 \u03bcL of the pellet was placed in Thin Prep PreservCyt vials before the molecular testing for the respiratory viruses. The CLART PneumoVir kit was used (GENOMICA) that is capable of detecting and characterizing the presence of the 17 most frequent types of human viruses causing respiratory infections, in the most common clinical samples. Viruses analyzed include: influenza virus A, B, and C; PIV 1, 2, 3, and 4 (subtypes A and B); respiratory syncytial virus type A (RSV\u2010A); RSV\u2010B; rhinovirus; human metapneumovirus (hMPV; subtypes A and B); enterovirus (echovirus); adenovirus; coronavirus; and bocavirus. The molecular procedure was followed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 200 \u03bcL of Thin Prep PreservCyt solution were used for viral DNA/RNA extraction. Virus amplification was performed via two reverse transcriptase multiplex polymerase chain reactions, and the detection/visualization was performed based on the low\u2010density microarrays. Negative controls were included in each experiment. The point of care test mariPOC (ArcDia International Oy Ltd, Turku, Finland) an automated, multianalyte antigen test was used in conjunction with our clinical arrays system. The second test was used because it provided the results within 2 hours of testing and thus assisted in management decisions regarding the discharge of the patient from the emergency department; in addition examined the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen in conjunction. Positive results by any of the two methods used were considered for the analysis. In five cases (three influenza, one hMPV, and one bocavirus infections there was a positive\u2010 point\u2010of\u2010care (POC) test with the negative array test.",

We also performed analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare cytokine levels between the groups of no virus identification, A(H3N2) influenza positive, A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza positive, RSV positive, PIV positive, and any other virus positive (least significant ifference i.e. LSD and Games\u2010Howell post hoc tests are reported as appropriate according to the Levene\u2019s homogeneity of variance testing and Welch testing of equality of means). Mixed infections were analyzed separately and not added in the individual virus (contributing to the mixed infection) numbers. Further, we looked for cytokine interrelations using Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient. Correlation between symptoms and virus detection was performed with univariate analysis. We separately examined influenza AH3N2, AH1N1pdm09, influenza B, RSV, and PIV infections compared with other or no virus detection. Multivariate analysis examined factors associated with more severe disease and need for hospitalization using logistic regression. More specifically any factor with a statistical significance of P \u2264 0.1 was included in the multivariate analyses. In final models effects of potential confounding variables in the association with IL\u201017 levels (eg, WBC, the presence of comorbidities, fever, fever height, and other clinical and laboratory parameters) as well as their interaction terms were included in the statistical models. All statistical tests were two\u2010tailed. Data analysis was performed using the SPSS program (version 25.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL).",

A crucial role for IL\u201017\u2010mediated inflammation has been found for microbial clearance8; on the other hand, uncontrolled signaling has been associated with autoimmune disease and even cancer progression.8 Specific family members have discrete roles in human immunity eg, IL\u201017F is mainly involved in mucosal host defense mechanisms, whereas IL\u201017E (IL\u201025) is an amplifier of Th2 immune responses.9, 10, 11 Over the last few years very few studies have examined the role of the Th17 pathway in human influenza infections,12 and none to our knowledge in humans with the respiratory infection, and in comparison with other viruses affecting the respiratory tract. Recent literature suggests that Th17 adaptive immunity may be involved in the clearance of influenza viruses from the respiratory tract.",

Furthermore, we did not study the dynamic evolution of these markers over the course of the viral infection; thus our study is just a snapshot of mild to moderately ill patients showing up in the emergency department of a tertiary care center. It is possible that we have missed patients with milder pictures that quickly cleared the virus from their systems (like some of the patients with no virus detection in our study) thus missing the full spectrum of Th17 response in respiratory viral infections. Sampling from other sites, for example nasal sampling or BAL (in severe cases), would assist in better understanding the difference/synergy between local compared with systemic cytokine effects. In addition, although we carefully recorded and analyzed data on variables potentially adversely affecting an effective immune response we could not account for residual confounding in this study. We can only hypothesize about the mechanism behind the difference in the cytokine profile observed between influenza A and B in our effort. Influenza B infection remains less studied than influenza A both in humans and animals despite the fact that it is associated with a significant number of respiratory infection cases during winter.32 Contrary to our findings, in a study of 72 patients comparing cytokine levels in type A vs type B influenza, IL\u201017A (the hallmark cytokine of the TH17 cell subset) along with IL\u20106 levels were significantly higher in type B influenza.33 A less virulent circulating B strain could explain our findings. In an animal study that used an immunosuppressed\u2010mouse model of influenza B infection and a cytokine panel that included IL\u201017, there was no evidence of an important contribution of Th17 in the pathogenicity.34 Moreover different degrees of immunopathology was caused by two different influenza B viruses; the Victoria lineage virus was more virulent and was associated with greater morbidity and 100% lethality in these experiments.34 Interestingly, during the period of our study the main influenza B strain across Europe and in Greece belonged to the Yamagata lineage.35 Due to the small sample of this study, this difference will have to be verified in other studies that would specifically examine different lineages of the virus. Finally, the role of Th17 in the effects of influenza on other systems was not assessed in this effort. For example, in a mouse model of respiratory influenza a significant Th17 response in the intestine that was associated with immune intestinal injury and development of diarrhea was noted; furthermore neutralizing IL\u201017A reduced intestinal injury.36 Intestinal microbiota changes and their relation to influenza or other virus\u2010mediated cytokine changes, which is an interesting field for further human research; it could not be assessed in the current effort.36\n",

This association and especially the one observed for influenza AH3N2 and PIV is novel and merits consideration even if the finding comes from a small pilot. Future verification of our study results as well as further exploitation of this cytokine pathway for diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic purpose that may greatly assist in the management of common but potentially serious viral respiratory infections is necessary.",
