            "text": "The use of real-time PCR in molecular diagnostics has rapidly gained ground and has become the golden standard in many instances, in particular when sensitivity is a concern and quantification is desired, for example, when monitoring the effect of anti-viral treatment (Mackay et al., 2002, Mackay, 2004, Mengoli et al., 2004, Tanaka-Kitajima et al., 2005). An additional advantage is that the detection takes place in a homogeneous closed-tube format, which means a significantly reduced risk for carry-over contamination compared to conventional methods (Foy and Parkes, 2001). PCR-based assays are particularly sensitive and robust for detection and quantification of DNA viruses, due to the high conservation of the genomic materials over different strains in combination with the high chemical stability of deoxyribonucleic acids. The remarkable sensitivity of PCR, where a single DNA copy can be detected by an optimized assay, makes the extraction procedure the limiting factor in the diagnostic setting rather than the PCR-coupled detection step (Fafi-Kremer et al., 2004, Schuurman et al., 2005, Uhl et al., 2005). However, even if nucleic acid extraction has been successful there are several ways by which the PCR amplification/detection step may fail. Among these are: (i) the target for primers and/or probe may not be conserved (particularly relevant in infectious disease diagnostics) (Herrmann et al., 2004, Nye et al., 2005), (ii) the fluorescent probes used in real-time PCR are frequently chemically unstable and may be degraded.",

            "text": "Recently, the LightUp\u00ae probe was constructed to alleviate these drawbacks encountered in PCR based diagnostics (Svanvik et al., 2000a, Svanvik et al., 2000b, Leijon, 2004). This is accomplished by the use of a fluorescent reporter dye that is coupled to an oligomer of the DNA analogue peptide nucleic acid (PNA) by a flexible linker (Fig. 1\n). PNA is an uncharged isomorphous DNA mimic composed of N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine subunits (Nielsen et al., 1991) that provides strong but still specific binding and serves as the sequence recognizing element of the probe. In fact, PNA has the remarkable property of exhibiting higher sequence specificity, in terms of melting point decrease, when bound to DNA than DNA itself (Egholm et al., 1993). Shorter probes can be used with the LightUp\u00ae Probe technology than with most competing DNA based probe technologies (Livak et al., 1995, Tyagi and Kramer, 1996, Bernard et al., 1998, Mackay et al., 2002). This is due to the high binding affinity of PNA that is further augmented by the dye interaction with DNA. Thus, conserved patches can be found more easily in highly varying microbial or viral genomes. In this respect LightUp probes resemble TaqMan\u00ae minor groove binding (MGB) probes (Afonina et al., 1997). The fluorophor used in LightUp\u00ae probes is an asymmetric cyanine dye that fluoresces when the probe binds its target DNA but is virtually non-fluorescent when the probe is free in solution. One example is thiazole orange shown in Fig. 1. Other examples are the SYBR Green proprietary dye from Molecular probes Inc (Oregon, USA), and the BOXTO dye (Karlsson et al., 2003, Karlsson et al., 2004) that is shown in Fig. 2\n. The use of PNA is important. Since the dye is positively charged, a significantly higher background signal would result from internal binding of the dye if DNA was used instead of PNA (Svanvik et al., 2001). This class of fluorescent dyes are also relatively stable and the ReSSQ\u00ae kits that are based on the LightUp\u00ae probe can be stored in the fridge rather than the freezer storage typical for other PCR kits. These dyes in combination with the PNA backbone, which is degraded by neither nucleases nor proteases (Demidov et al., 1994), amounts to very stable probes and robust assays. To further improve the stability of the ReSSQ\u00ae product line the nucleic acids standard materials are provided lyophilized.",

            "text": "DNA based sequence recognizing fluorescent probes usually utilize fluorophor quencher pairs that are separated during the amplification process. TaqMan\u00ae probes are degraded by the 5\u2032-nuclease activity of the DNA polymerase which releases the fluorophor from its sequence recognizing element, and thereby separates it from the quencher so that fluorescence emission can occur (Livak et al., 1995). Molecular Beacons achieve the same goal by a rearrangement of the secondary structure upon hybridization, which causes a separation of the quencher and the fluorophor (Tyagi and Kramer, 1996). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes work slightly differently. Instead of the acceptor dye functioning as a quencher, it emits the detectable fluorescence when the two probes bind adjacent to each other on the target DNA molecule (Bernard et al., 1998). The LightUp\u00ae Probe works by a different mechanism. The probe has only a single asymmetric cyanine dye. This type of dye releases the excitation energy by internal motion when free in solution and is under these conditions virtually non-fluorescent and hence it is self-quenched. When bound to DNA, however, the dye becomes brightly fluorescent due to motional hindrance in the bound state (Svanvik et al., 2000a).",

Although all these tests are very useful, in-house so-called home-brew real-time PCR assays have come to increasing use. The main reasons are the superior sensitivity of PCR, the closed tube format of real-time PCR, which minimizes the risk for cross-over contamination, and the possibility of reproducible and precise viral load quantifications, as outlined above. However, the results from home-brew assays are often not reproducible between laboratories and there is consequently a need for standardization.",

To this end QCMD designs and develops quality control materials and proficiency programmes. In Table 1\n(reproduced from Zweygberg Wirgart et al., 2005) the quantification of the QCMD CMV proficiency panels of 2002 and 2003 obtain by using the ReSSQ\u00ae CMV assay are shown. The viral loads measured by the ReSSQ\u00ae assay are close to the QCMD target values on both panels with an average deviation of only 23%. Furthermore, all negative controls are confirmed without false-positive results. Zweygberg Wirgart and collegues did also use the ReSSQ\u00ae assay to monitor the effect of anti-varial treatment and compared the results with those obtained with the AMPLICOR CMV MONITOR assay (Roche Diagnostics). The CMV DNA load was monitored in one allogeneic bone marrow-transplanted patient during a period of 175 days (Fig. 4\n). After 2 months of prophylactic Valtrex therapy with very low or undetectable CMV DNA levels, the viral load increased significantly at day 65 and continued to rise, as determined by both assays. The patient was therefore treated with Cymevene from day 74, but did not respond, and as resistance to ganciclovir was suspected the patient was switched to Foscavir therapy on day 87. Ganciclovir resistance was indeed verified subsequently. The high CMV viral loads were successfully suppressed by the Foscavir therapy, but as the drug was not well tolerated by the patient, therapy was interrupted. Increasing levels of CMV was again detected at day 153 by both assays, and suppressed after a second Foscavir treatment. The course of events is clearly reflected in the viral load determinations and both methods yield closely similar results. This shows that the ReSSQ\u00ae assay is a highly useful tool for CMV viral load monitoring (Zweygberg Wirgart et al., 2005).",

Probe concentrations were determined spectroscopically assuming molar absorptivities at 260 nm of 83 100 (mol/l)\u22121cm\u22121 for IgL\u03baLUP and 81 100 (mol/l)\u22121cm\u22121 for IgL\u03bbLUP (Svanvik et al., 2000b). The probes were designed to have melting temperatures of 65\u201370 \u00b0C, which is between the annealing (55 \u00b0C) and elongation (74 \u00b0C) temperatures of the PCRs. PCR systems were designed for a 231 bp fragment of the human IgL\u03ba (GenBank accession number AK024974) and a 223 bp fragment of the human IgL\u03bb (GenBank accession number X51755) comprising the IgL\u03baLUP and IgL\u03bbLUP target sequences, respectively. Reaction conditions were optimized as described elsewhere (Kubista et al., 2001). IgL\u03ba and IgL\u03bb PCR:s both contained 75 mmol/l Tris (pH 8.8), 20 mmol/l (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 U of JumpStartTM Taq DNA polymerase (with antibody) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 200 ng/\u03bcL of Bovine Serum Albumin (Fermentas). Specific components for the IgL\u03ba PCR were 5 mmol/l MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/l deoxyribonuleotides (Sigma-Aldrich), 800 nmol/l of each primer (MedProbe Inc) and 800 nmol/l IgL\u03baLUP, and for the IgL\u03bb PCR 3.5 mmol/l MgCl2, 0.4 mmol/l deoxyribonuleotides, 600 nmol/l of each primer and 600 nmol/l IgL\u03bbLUP. Primer sequences were for IgL\u03ba 5\u2032-TGA GCA AAG CAG ACT ACG AGA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GGG GTG AGG TGA AAG ATG AG-3\u2032 (reverse), and for IgL\u03bb 5\u2032-GAG CCT GAC GCC TGA G-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ATT GAG GGT TTA TTG AGT GCA G-3\u2032 (reverse).",

The threshold was set to a value of 1.00, which was significantly above background noise, and the number of cycles required to reach this level, C\nt, was determined.",

            "text": "Thirty-two patient samples were analyzed for B-cell lymphoma by the LightUp Q-PCR assays. Twenty samples were surgical biopsies and 12 were collected as fine needle aspirates (St\u00e5hlberg et al., 2003). All samples were run in duplicates including negative controls. The data are presented in Fig. 9\n. In the scatter plot each symbol represents one sample and is positioned in the plot on the coordinate (CTIgL\u03ba, CTIgL\u03bb). The corresponding number of cDNA molecules of purified template is indicated in logarithmic scale on the opposite axes. Samples found negative by IHC analysis are shown in green and positive samples are shown in red. The samples above the pink arc are those collected as fine needle aspirates. The relative expression of two genes is given by (St\u00e5hlberg et al., 2005):(1)N0IgL\u03baN0IgL\u03bb=KRS\u2217\u03b7IgL\u03bb(1+EIgL\u03bb)CTIgL\u03bb-1\u03b7IgL\u03ba(1+EIgL\u03ba)CTIgL\u03ba-1This can be rearranged into linear form (St\u00e5hlberg et al., 2003):(2)CTIgL\u03ba=b\u2217CTIgL\u03bb+mHence, the data points representing negative samples in the scatter plot can be fitted to a straight line that will represent the IgL\u03ba:IgL\u03bb expression ratio of healthy individuals. The approach does not require the IgL\u03ba:IgL\u03bb expression ratio to be known. In fact, the estimated ratio of 60:40 is for the IgL\u03ba:IgL\u03bb light chains, which is the ratio of the protein products. The ratio of the corresponding mRNAs could be different, for example, due to a difference in translation efficiencies of the mRNAs. In the original study the authors estimated the parameters in Eq. (1) from a detailed characterization of a subset of the samples by in situ calibration (St\u00e5hlberg et al., 2003). They found that the IgL\u03ba:IgL\u03bb mRNA expression ratio of negative samples indeed is close to 60:40, and the authors could also calculate 95% confidence interval for the negative samples. The confidence interval is indicated in the scatter plot by the dashed lines. Hence, negative samples based on QPCR results are expected to be within the dashed lines, while positive samples with \u03ba clonality are found below the lines and samples with \u03bb clonality are above the lines. The agreement between the QPCR (position in the scatter plot) and IHC (color) classifications is excellent. For the fine needle aspirates, found above the arc in Fig. 9, the agreement was perfect, even though these samples contained very few cells and therefore not very much mRNA. This very high predictive power of the LightUp probed IgL\u03ba vs. IgL\u03bb assay demonstrates the strength of designing assays based on relative expression of two reciprocal marker genes instead of comparing expression of a single marker gene with that of a reference gene. Recently, the same strategy was used to diagnose mantle cell lymphoma by measuring the CCND1:CCND3 expression ratio (Jones et al., 2004). The strategy is not limited to two marker genes. Any number of marker genes can be used, and companies such as MultiD Analyses (www.multid.se) are developing software to classify samples based on an arbitrary number of marker genes, without relying on reference genes, by identifying characteristic expression patterns.",
