The data show that people are more worried now than they were 3 years ago, and most admit that their concern has grown significantly in the last year as a result of the increase in weather extremes, media reporting, and climate activism.",

Another survey conducted by Survation (not an environmental organization) in September 2019 found that a third of the British public thinks that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be reduced to zero by 2025: 25 years ahead of the government's target of 2050. Over 30% think the target should be brought forward to between 2025 and 2050. However, half of the British public thinks it is unlikely that the British government will achieve its net-zero-emission target by 2050, suggesting a lack of trust in political leadership. People's lives will inevitably change as a result of climate change through responding to its impacts and the need to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. People will need to make changes in terms of behaviors, work practices, and levels of consumption. As we have seen recently during the COVID-19 pandemic, the choices people make will be guided by government regulations, social practices, and individual decisions, all of which will be shaped by the availability of information and the way in which it is communicated.",

In particular, natural and social scientists must work together to consider how to align their messages to enhance public understanding and engagement. This Primer will outline the challenges and opportunities of climate change communication in three parts. First, it will highlight the heterogeneous manner in which climate change messaging is received by different audiences. Second, it will consider the gap between knowledge and action and how understanding the emotional and affective dimensions of climate messaging could play a role in closing this gap.

Translating the carefully nuanced conclusions of the laboratory into lay and policy language necessitates a goal quite opposite to nullius in verba: the crafting of an authentic, authoritative voice on whose word an audience will accept an argument without recourse to further evidence. This is a transition that must be managed with care so that a degree of underlying rigor survives it, yet no approach is without pitfalls. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has discovered as its reports emerge in journalism, findings are often interpreted in interested ways without the ''envelope'' of definitions, caveats, and context that surround them in their original contexts and are newly imbued with microcosmic positionalities.",

Soon after, the Tyndall Centre email hack in 2009 saw a single phrase-''Mike's trick,'' referring to the graphical transition from tree ring to thermometer data in Michael Mann's 1999 hockey-stick graph-undermine a global green movement with false allegations of scientific conspiracy. It would be almost a decade before overall public ''belief'' in anthropogenic climate change recovered to the levels of 2009. However, problematic as such issues are for the public understanding of climate change, they are in reality the tip of the iceberg. As exemplified almost daily in relation to climate change, judgments over whose knowledge is worthwhile and whose is not are highly political acts. The proportion of those who ''believe'' in anthropogenic climate change and the seriousness of its impacts varies both according to country-and the prevailing national environmental discourse therein-and according to demography. In the US, for example, as shown in Figure 1 , there is a 63-point difference between the most conservative Republicans (32%) and the most liberal Democrats (95%) claiming to be ''somewhat'' or ''very'' worried about climate change. Gender and race, similarly, are significant and consistent predictors of attitudes to climate change, leaving the conservative white male as an outlying-albeit disproportionately influential-low point in the data.",

Social science has only recently begun in earnest to get to grips with how climate change is affecting society, but its arrival, though late, has been fruitful. In particular, recent work on climate anxiety, climate change perception, and climate change denial have brought a nuanced conception of the public understanding of science.

The problem is not a knowledge deficit, particularly in Europe and the US, where there have been a large number of campaigns on climate communication and outreach. Climate change skepticism is low, public awareness of and concern about climate change is high, and surveys in many countries have shown high levels of support for climate change policies, such as the deployment of renewable energy and reforestation. Despite this widespread support for climate action, behavioral change remains low.

They have highlighted several barriers to public awareness, such as a lack of funding for climate communications and the spread of misinformation, and have also identified various solutions. These include the importance of communicating solutions as well as problems, tailoring communication to specific audiences, and engaging people with narratives rather than statistics. These latter points were partic-ularly emphasized by the UK organization Climate Outreach. They have created a range of publications on communicating with different audiences, such as 18-to 25-year-olds, the political center-right, and members of the five major faiths. They have also created a communication guide specifically for climate scientists from the IPCC. In this they highlight the importance of communicating authentically in order to be trusted as a messenger by relating discussions to people's past experience and highlighting the relevance of problems to people's daily lives. They also emphasize the power of storytelling to ensure that messages resonate with people's diverse values and emphasize scientific consensus while carefully explaining uncertainty and the scientific method.",

Maria Ojala, associate professor of psychology at \u00d6 rebro University in Sweden, has found that many young people feel pessimistic and unempowered about climate change, even in developed countries such as Sweden, as they experience a combination of worry for the future and guilt for being in countries more responsible for GHG emissions. Rather than being concerned with the risks to their own lives, youths express worry about impacts on future generations and vulnerable communities around the world.

Although recent movements such as Extinction Rebellion have mobilized many people by using fearful messages, this needs to be coupled with tangible solutions to prevent the public from slipping into apathy or denial. Despite widespread awareness of climate change, behavioral change remains low because of a lack of clear ways in which individuals and communities should react. Many accept that climate change is a problem, but the question that remains on their lips is, ''what can I do about it?'' As trusted messengers, climate scientists can reassure others by being seen as doing their part, combatting the spiral of silence and perceptions of widespread inaction by sharing positive examples, and promoting opportunities to engage in tangible solutions.

They are useful ways of enhancing local knowledge, understanding, and engagement with climate change and can enable a better connection to climate change solutions (Figure 3 ).

Politicians use them to engage their constituents, as do teachers with their students, enabling a better connection between theoretical and experiential experiences. Narratives can be built in a number of ways depending on the issue in question, the purpose of the narrative, and the audience-messenger interface. They help frame complex and challenging societal issues such as climate change in a way that aligns and resonates with people's values and builds on what climate change impacts and solutions mean to them.

This needs to go beyond presenting facts and data to ensure that it aligns closely with the values, beliefs, and interests of specific audiences. Asking ''who is this for?'' is a first question to answer when communicating science; this will enable a closer tailoring of the message and ensure that salience to the issue is as high as possible. This can be done through directly addressing any perceived barriers to change that exist and enabling a more positive vision of what a low-carbon future looks like, for example, by demonstrating the benefits (e.g., financial, co-benefits, and quality of life) and opportunities from a low-carbon future, how this will still enable people to maintain independence and freedom of choice, how a transition to a low-carbon future can have relatively limited Adapted from Viner and Howarth, 2014. disruptions if carefully crafted, and what the implications of not shifting might be.",
