Patients included in the study were registered at \u223c500 distinct practices. All diagnoses and patient interventions are summarised and stored as READ codes. The READ system generally maps onto International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, with one or more READ codes per ICD code and additional non-ICD diagnostic codes for presenting symptoms which are widely used in primary care to describe minor illness. Under the guidance of two experts, we defined sets of READ codes corresponding to ICD codes of interest (ICD codes summarised in table 1; READ equivalents available on request). In addition, preliminary searches of the CPRD dictionary were made to assess the frequency of symptom and other diagnostic codes used during three influenza peak periods, and the frequency in periods in which influenza did not circulate. This procedure revealed codes used by GPs to code patients who present with symptoms of acute respiratory infection during periods of influenza (and by extension RSV) activity.",

Influenza vaccine coverage in the UK during the study was 15% as measured in CPRD across all ages, but was lower in younger age groups. While the highest incidences of RSV-attributable GP episodes, hospitalisations and deaths were in infants <6 months of age, the burden of GP episodes remained high until 4 years of age. Indeed, around 36% of GP episodes for RSV-attributable respiratory disease occurred in children 2\u20134 years of age. As well as acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis, which are well-recognised clinical syndromes associated with RSV infection in children, between 6.3% (5\u201317 years old) and 13.0% (2\u20134 years old) of otitis media was also attributed to RSV in our study. This is consistent with studies that assessed viral pathogens in middle ear fluid, which have frequently identified RSV as the infectious agent in children with otitis media.12\u201314 Our study points to a large burden in terms of GP episodes for RSV-associated otitis media in children of all ages, particularly in children aged <5 years. Moreover, RSV infection was associated with substantial antibiotic use in the community; there were an average 416 000 prescribed antibiotic courses per season. These results indicate that RSV infection in children constitutes a major health and economic burden, and thus provides a strong case for increasing efforts to prevent RSV in the age group up to 4 years.",

The cyclic components therefore took a greater portion of the burden of RSV than they took from the burden of influenza. Thus, inclusion of the cyclic terms in the model may have caused the burden of RSV to be underestimated; in any event, their inclusion substantially reduced the risk that the study overestimates RSV burden. This is because RSV infections follow regular seasonal cycles in temperate climates, and the seasonal terms do not necessarily adjust for temporal autocorrelation in the time series. This is a limitation of most studies on disease burden that make use of epidemiological time series because there is not currently a technique that can satisfactorily ensure temporal and spatial independence in the structure of the time-series data, and simultaneously yield biologically meaningful estimates of disease burden. The best approach in such cases is to recognise the exploratory nature of this type of study and avoid an excessive reliance on p values and CIs (which are determined based on the assumption of independence). When developing the model, we ran variants with shorter period cyclical terms, and found that adding these terms did not explain any more of the variability.",

We showed that most RSV infections in children were captured by a diagnosis of bronchitis and bronchiolitis. While other groups have modelled even broader diagnostic ranges (cardiorespiratory, or all-cause),18\n19 we found that using multiple cause diagnoses (\u2018any mention\u2019 for HES and ONS data) and a broad respiratory definition (respiratory disease broadly defined, all databases), consistently captured the RSV burden in all settings.

Effective antiviral treatments and preventive vaccines are urgently needed for the management of RSV infection in children. Unlike influenza, RSV displays generally consistent seasonality and therefore predictability of the annual RSV epidemic. This information could be used by policymakers in terms of the timing of possible preventative strategies, but also in planning and preparing for peaks in healthcare use during RSV epidemics.",
