The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts' comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can leverage the scenarios in long-term strategic planning.",

Significant changes are expected in the economic system as well as in the social sphere inducing a series of research challenges (Mariani and Borghi, 2019; Caviggioli and Ughetto, 2019) . Central to this growing body of literature is the assumption that Industry 4.0 has paradigmatic properties that make it comparable to previous industrial revolutions (e.g., Steenhuis and Pretorius, 2017; Li et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2018; Kim, 2018) . The nature of these properties is however still questioned against ongoing technological uncertainties, early implementation examples, and late macro-economic indicators (Brynjolffson and McAffee, 2016; OECD, 2017) .",

Closer relationships between manufacturers and broad ecosystems of software developers, technology and service providers have been posited (e.g., Rogers et al., 2016; Ehret and Wirtz, 2017; Rymaszewska et al., 2017) together with increasing commoditization of physical products and falling industry boundaries (e.g., Porter and Heppelmann, 2014; 2015; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2014) .

This is only partially motivated by the rapid transformative developments characterizing Industry 4.0 today (Drath and Horch, 2014; Frank et al., 2019a) ; other reasons lie the way the issue has been approached so far. First, Industry 4.0 technologies have been mostly analyzed individually; this focus -although beneficial for isolating initial hypotheses -does not reflect their aggregate effects (e.g., Chiarello et al., 2018; Mariani and Borghi, 2019; Culot et al., In Press) . Second, the literature has been developing within specific streams of research, largely neglecting the long-debated interdependencies between competitive strategy and operations configuration (e.g., Skinner, 1969; Chen and Paulraj, 2004) . Third -with few exceptions -impacts have been investigated from the perspective of the focal company and its first-tier relations, whereas evolutionary phenomena are characterized by the embeddedness of individual decisions and outcomes in larger networks of business relations (e.g., Granovetter, 1985; Gulati et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2001; McFarland and Payan, 2008; Pagani and Pardo, 2017) .",

As an ongoing revolution, Industry 4.0 is bound to represent a challenge to many existing theories; it is crucial today to anticipate where the depth and breadth of changes require scholarly research in order to draw attention to explaining the nature of the configuration decisions made by manufacturing companies in this new context. This is particularly relevant as -in front of extraordinary technological opportunities -business leaders may risk making hasty decisions overseeing long-term dynamics beyond single technology applications and industry boundaries.",

We believe that the future of Industry 4.0 can be understood only by considering the various emerging technologies with respect to their impact on multi-tier supplier-customer relations and parallel evolutions in adjacent industries -e.g., platform-based intermediaries, digital players entering the manufacturing space and AMTs bringing in nonmanufacturing producers. VC analysis has often proved effective in the literature to investigate recurring patterns and interdependencies in the configuration of intra-and extra-industry players (Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark, 2016; Hern\u00e1ndez and Pedersen, 2017; Sartor et al., 2015; Raikes et al., 2000) .",

As a result, we provide a comprehensive overview of which configurations are to be expected under the Industry 4.0 paradigm and raise questions on some impacts that, although broadly discussed in the literature, were perceived as controversial by the expert panel.

Several studies have also argued for a strong relationship between Industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing (e.g., Totorella and Fettermann, 2017; Pagliosa et al., 2019; Rosin et al., 2020) as well as with circular economy practices (e.g., Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018; Rosa et al. 2020; Kouhizadeh et al., In Press) .

Academics have been focusing on three main trends: the first is related to increasing mass-customization (Bogers et al., 2016) , the second to higher sustainability (Nascimento et al., 2019) , the third to a progressive dematerialization from physical products to digital designs (e.g., D'Aveni, 2015; Jiang et al., 2017) and services (e.g., Ehret and Wirtz, 2017; Ardolino et al., 2018; Frank et al., 2019b) . The literature has been developing in two concurrent streams, one with a focus on IoT-driven digital services and non-ownership models (e.g., Porter and Heppelmann, 2014; Rymaszewska et al., 2017; Boehmer et al., 2020) , the other on AMTs' potential for new forms of production. These refer to digital platforms simplifying access to manufacturing capabilities (e.g., Rogers et al., 2016; Ryan et al., 2017) , on-site printing by retailers and logistics operators (e.g., Jia et al., 2015; Durach et al., 2017) and private 3D printers installed in homes or community centers (e.g., Birtchnell and Urry, 2013; Halassi et al., 2019) .",

These hypotheses have found initial empirical confirmation in Fratocchi (2018) , Ancarani et al. (2019) , Dachs et al. (2019) and Stentoft and Rajkumar (2019) . The increasing applicability of AMTs has imparted new impetus to research on redistributed manufacturing -i.e., a model of localized production involving many small or micro-scale manufacturing facilities (e.g. Rauch et al., 2017; Hannibal and Knight, 2018) . The model is currently being piloted in specific segments, such as 3D-printed spare parts (e.g., Cherukov et al., 2018) .",

Few studies -mainly conceptual (e.g., Porter and Heppelman, 2014; LaPlume et al., 2016; Sun and Zhao, 2017 ) -have approached the issue considering whole industries or VCs.

            "text": "In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the configuration trajectories affecting manufacturing VCs, three further streams of literature should also be mentioned. The first one is related to the growing academic interest around technological platforms. The current debate on Industry 4.0 in manufacturing has only partially been influenced by the \"economic perspective\" of platform research so far (Gawer, 2014;  McIntyre and Srinivisan, 2017), the main focus being on manufacturers sponsoring technological platforms to engage with third-party complementors. The increasing prevalence of platform-based approaches raises, however, further questions concerning demand dynamics (e.g., Bryonlfsson et al., 2010) , cross-industry consolidation trends (e.g., Eisenmann et al., 2011; Ruutu et al., 2017) as well as potential direct competition between platforms and manufacturers (e.g., Zhu and Liu, 2018) . The second stream of research is related to data management for value creation in the era of big data (e.g., Davenport, 2017; Iansiti and Lahkani, 2020; Hagiu and Wright, 2020; Spiekermann and Korunustovska, 2017) . In these studies, attention has been placed on understanding how different types of data represent a source of competitive advantage, an issue that has been tackled only marginally in the research investigating IoT-enabled business models in manufacturing. The third and last stream is also related to the data issue, where some studies have also investigated emerging business models and concentration dynamics of technology providers in the IoT (Metallo et al., 2018; Basaure et al., In press) and in the big data industries (e.g., Urbinati et al., 2019; Nuccio and Guerzoni, 2019) .",

We assumed that our analysis should be stretched beyond individual companies' boundaries and dyadic relationships. As system-level construct, the VC seemed the most apt as it includes both manufacturing and non-manufacturing players, encompasses different stages along the value creation process, and allows for syncretic analyses.",

            "text": "Once the boundaries are defined, the conceptual model breaks down the VC into its building blocks, or single activities (2). The single activities vary by industry and are normally identified through the analysis of a VC input-output structure as individual firms are producers/users of inputs to/from other firms (Hopkins and Wallerstein, 1994) . Activities typically included are research and development, raw material and technology supply, upstream and downstream manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales. In line with well-established concepts in the study of supply chains (e.g., Lambert et al., 1998; Choi et al., 2001; Carter et al., 2015) , we considered both physical and support activities. The two inner boxes in the conceptual model specifically differentiate activities related to value transformation -i.e., the production of physical goods and related services -from those involving value intermediationi.e., the transfer of value between different stages of the VC and ultimately to the consumer. At this level of analysis, we adopted the typical lenses of industrial organization (IO) economy as it developed from its early days (e.g., Mason, 1939; Bain, 1956) . We considered business models and new entrants (2A), the level of concentration (2B), and the barriers to entry (2C). Moreover, because reshoring and redistributed manufacturing emerged as key topics in the literature, we also included the geographical location (2D) of activities as a topic for investigation. The third level of analysis considers cross-activity (3) dynamics and examines the way in which single activities are linked together by VC participants. The reasoning is grounded again in the IO economics tradition, as well as in the concepts of global commodity chains (GCCs), global value chains (GVCs) and global production networks (GPNs), concepts that originated to explain the geographies and governance of activities in the context of the globalization phenomenon (e.g., Raikes et al., 2000; Gereffi et al., 2005; Coe et al., 2008; Gibbon et al., 2009; Hern\u00e1ndez and Pedersen, 2017) . At this level of analysis, we took into account governance modes on a market-hierarchy continuum (3A), rent distribution (3B) and the degree of geographical dispersion (3C).",

The respondents were moderately positive towards micro-factories serving multiple clients (#8), a model that -supported by new production and digital coordination technologies (#8a/e) -could be more effective for flexibility and customization purposes (#8b/h). The same arguments support the prospect of a slight increase in virtual manufacturing approaches (#11) -i.e., the full outsourcing of production activities -despite possible limitations for complex products (#11m). Business models based on digital services substituting traditional offerings (#9) are foreseen as one of the key features of future manufacturing VCs and seem supported by the spread of smart products, non-ownership approaches, and the digitalization of business services (#9a/b/d/h).

In data management, consolidation seems driven by the presence of scale advantages (#20a/b), IoT technology standardization (#20c) and a lack of specific capabilities (#20f). The other projections referring to players' size actually seem subject to contrasting trends. The ongoing consolidation of intermediate goods manufacturers across industries (#17) might be counterbalanced by new production technologies supporting small-scale production (#17e). The same applies to final good manufacturing (#18): small players could be increasingly involved in customized production as a result of new technologies (#18a, b), but large companies might also prefer production internalization to capture the higher margins of customized products (#18g). New technologies are also bringing about opportunities for small firms in product design and software programming (#19), as digital tools simplify the coordination of a large number of suppliers and even single professionals (#19b/d). These opportunities, however, came out as strongly industry-dependent (#19e/f/g). Regarding the concentration levels in service provision (#21) and intermediation activities (#22), the analysis of the experts' comments highlights the assumption that digital services and online channels might be subject to consolidation trends due to data-related advantages and network effects (#21b, #22a/b).

Results (Projections #4; #31) also confirm an intimate relationship between Industry 4.0 and circular economy practices (e.g., Nascimento et al., 2019; Kouhizadeh et al., In press; Rosa et al., 2020) .

Even though an increasing regional organization of supply chains is expected (Projection #42), new models seem applicable mainly to volatile high-value product categories leaving the bulk of mass market production relatively unaffected (Projections #6; #8; #26; #35), while new outsourcing opportunities seem less relevant as focal companies internalize high-margin production (Projections #11; #29; #41).",

However, many efficiency-and innovation-related benefits are expected to come from data sharing (Kagermann et al., 2013; Evans and Annunziata, 2012; Liao et al., 2017) . Policymakers are working on a solution for legal issues related to the access to and transfer of nonpersonal machine-generated data, data liability, as well as portability of non-personal data, interoperability and standards (e.g., European Commission, 2020). Intellectual property legislation is also expected to evolve to reap the benefits of new production models (e.g., Kurfess and Cass, 2014; Steenhuis and Pretorius, 2017; Chan et al., 2018) . The evolution of the regulatory environment, new technical solutions for interoperability and integration together with some early success examples might increase data sharing practices in the future.

The rapid developments and successful applications of new production technologies -especially AMTs -have often fueled huge expectations (e.g., Jiang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019b) . Academic research has also underlined ongoing limitations in their applicability (e.g., LaPlume et al., 2016; Durach et al., 2017) and their cost-effectiveness in large-scale manufacturing operations (e.g., Atzeni et al., 2010; Baumers et al., 2016 Baumers et al., , 2017 Baumers and Holweg, 2018) . These concerns were echoed in several experts' comments. In our analysis, the hypothesis of a \"high\" maturity describes a future where AMTs and advanced robotics can easily be bought on the market and applied cost-effectively on a broad range of products, vice versa \"low\" maturity assumes that these technologies do not apply. This driver is relevant for the production of physical products and thus has been considered only for the customization scenarios.",

The abundant literature on mass customization in operations and supply chain management provides the starting point (e.g., Fogliatto et al., 2012; Suzid et al., 2018) . In the first two scenarios -(1) Production commoditization and (2) End-to-end VC transparency -high levels of data transparency enable efficient outsourcing due to a decrease in transaction costs (Coarse, 1937; Williamson 1987) . In scenario (1) a low AMTs' asset specificity makes suppliers virtually interchangeable (McGuiness, 1994; Lonsdale, 2001) . This, in turn, leads to price pressures, commoditization of production, and efficiency-seeking efforts. As a result, a process of market consolidation takes place; new manufacturing giants operate a broad network of localized production facilities. In scenario (2) End-to-End VC transparency focal companies orchestrate articulated supply chains of specialized manufacturers of intermediate goods. The core dynamics of this scenario are explained through the resource dependency theory (Donaldson, 2001) : because of specialized capabilities, suppliers have at their disposal high bargaining power against the focal company, maintain high barriers to entry, and retain some of the extra profit related to customization. The remaining two \"customization\" scenarios are based on the opposing logic for outsourcing. Data-related transaction costs make it inconvenient for focal companies to coordinate suppliers within very short time intervals, which is needed required for customization. The higher margins related to customized products drive production internalization in scenario (3) In-house production. In case AMTs and advanced robotics will not be available -as in scenario (4) In-house technology -focal companies are incentivized to invest in proprietary technology in order to reduce the labor-intensity of production processes.",

            "text": "The four \"servitization\" scenarios elaborate on manufacturing companies disintermediating sales and service networks as opposed to digital players and platforms developing their own offering. Central to our line of reasoning is the literature on manufacturing servitization (e.g., Baines and Lightfoot, 2014; Berret et al., 2015; Story et al., 2017) as well as the ever-growing research on platforms, both from an \"economic\" and an \"engineering design\" perspective (e.g., Gawer, 2014; McIntyre and Srinivasan, 2017) . The \"engineering design\" perspective -i.e., platforms as technological architectures to orchestrate a set of system complementors (e.g., Elorata and Turunen, 2016; Ondrus et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2019; Broekhuizen et al., In press ) -is at the basis of scenario (5) Open smart ecosystems. Industry 4.0 solutions demand high interdependencies of competences and technological complementarity, thus often give rise to innovation ecosystems (e.g. Benitez et al., In press) . In this scenario highly specialized players are involved through IoT platforms based on an open architecture. Data transparency offers relatively equal opportunities for value capture to the various firms involved. The \"economic perspective\" of platform research -i.e., platforms as multi-sided markets (e.g., Eisenmann et al., 2011; Cennamo and Santalo, 2013; Ghazawneh and Henfridsson, 2015) -is the most relevant for scenario (6) Platform-based renting/leasing. This scenario describes a situation where platforms become the dominant models in value intermediation. In a regime of high data transparency, low barriers to entry prevent \"winner takes all\" dynamics. In both scenarios (5) and (6) high data transparency coupled with cross-industry market ecosystems triggers the commoditization of data management activities. Scenario (7) In-house smart servitization describes a head-to-head competition among industry incumbents, digital players and intermediaries. Manufacturers orchestrate their own IoT platform-based architectures and build up a competitive advantage through the ownership of product inuse data and the internalization of sales channels together with core services. Digital players and intermediaries capitalize on their access to customer data and invest in their own IoT product-service architectures so as to grow across different industries. In the last scenario -(8) Enhanced renting/leasingtraditional products are offered as a service. In a regime of low data transparency manufacturers and intermediaries internalize services that guarantee extra profit.",

The study links literature in operations and supply chain management with strategy and business model research, including broad-range considerations on topics such as manufacturing servitization, mass customization, technological platforms and multi-sided markets, reshoring, and redistributed manufacturing. Second, our results describe the emerging paradigmatic characteristics of Industry 4.0, building on the assessment of expert academics and practitioners. This description confirms some dynamics highlighted in the literature, while putting into perspective other evolutionary trajectories, such as new production models, reshoring and individual prosumers. Third, the formulation of eight scenarios (see Figure 3 ) presents a range of possible futures, making explicit how Industry 4.0 is prone to different context-specific variations that can be traced back to four key drivers, namely demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products.",

As we explained in the methodology section, the study was carried out in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which was involved in the identification of the research question as well as in various brainstorming and validation sessions. Starting from here, the conceptual model ( Figure 2 ) and the list of projections (Table 2) can be used in strategic planning exercises as an assessment tool by companies, business associations, consulting firms, or regions/countries to identify future scenarios specific for a particular company, sector and/or geographical area. The four drivers identified as determinants of the different future scenarios (i.e., demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products) might also be considered separately to delve into the most compelling uncertainties behind strategy formulation. The projectionsor more likely a sub-set of them -might be analyzed by the aforementioned subject either through workshops and focus groups or through Delphi studies (as applied in this paper). Managers and consultants of companies operating in Apparel and Footwear, Automotive, and Machinery and Equipment may leverage our specific results (Tables 5-8) as direct input. Similarly, some specific findings might be used as a guideline for policy interventions (e.g., highlighting aspects, practices or sectors requiring more specific legislation).",

The current state of emergency impedes further considerations on how this may affect the results of our study.

The logical next step would be for the scenarios (Section 5.1) to be substantiated with empirical studies to understand their relevance and boundary conditions, as well as with theory-based research focused on explaining their mechanisms. Our effort might also be replicated in the service sector, to better understand emerging trajectories across current industry boundaries. The most relevant research opportunities refer to how VC \"control points\" (Section 5) will evolve in the light of emerging cross-industry ecosystems. The issue of data pinpoints this debate, managerial research is essential to understand barriers, benefits and drawbacks of data sharing with business partners and emerging data governance modes. Policy research should work to suggest a portfolio of long-term action points addressing the potential dark sides of data-sharing in manufacturing.",

At present, targeted responses must ensure that economic systems and individual organizations survive the shock in the short-term. In the long run, structural measures will be required to inject new impetus into the economy in the face of gloomy prospects of recession and unemployment. Among these structural measures, we expect investments in innovation -more likely backed by public incentives -to turn again the spotlight on the Industry 4.0 trajectory. Making the right decisions requires, however, that the options and their implications are well understood; it can only be hoped that -once the sanitary emergency is over -the preparations of our business leaders and policymakers will not be found wanting. In many respects the current understanding of the nature of Industry 4.0 is still blurred: different scenarios seem equally possible today depending on some crucial issues in relation to data, technologies, and demand characteristics. The effects of how these issues are approached will be profound not only for the future of individual companies but also for the competitiveness of manufacturing economies across the globe.",

Within this broad research focus, the configuration of manufacturing companies has been addressed from a competitive and an operations strategy perspective. Various methodologies have been employed aiming, on the one hand, at understanding how companies are currently shaping their approaches and, on the other, at deriving future general trends. Some characteristics have been highlighted in terms of manufacturing companies' value offering, location, governance and size; many questions do, however, remain on the specific implications. Several studies have also addressed possible impacts within the manufacturing companies' network of business relations, even though they mostly consider focal companies' first-tier interfaces. Potential changes refer to suppliers and partners, customers, intermediaries, competitors and relational dynamics across the various players along manufacturing VCs.Overall, the current understanding of the paradigmatic properties of Industry 4.0 is still unclear and -to a certain extent -ambivalent. Part of the issue is related to the fact that, today, researchers are clearly confronted with mostly exemplary cases of large-scale technology implementation (e.g.,Hofmann and R\u00fcsch, 2017;OECD, 2017; World Economic Forum, 2019)  and business model innovation(Bughin and van Zeebroeck, 2017; Weking et al., In Press). Academics investigating how companies -usually the mostadvanced ones -are configuring for Industry 4.0 have identified emerging trajectories and provided managers with insights on actual opportunities, but inevitably failed to describe the nature of the new paradigm and thus to make explicit the range of options and implications. Moreover, business models, ecosystems and supply chains analyzed from the point of view of focal firms did not consider the implications of parallel transformative evolutions in upstream and downstream manufacturing industries as well as in adjacent sectors.
