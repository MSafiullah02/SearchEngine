In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick [1] were the first researchers on mathematical epidemiology to propose the SIR model which is one of the classical epidemic models that has a compartment structure. In SIR systems, the host population is divided into three epidemiological groups: the susceptibles (S) (individuals not yet infected with the disease), the infectives (I) (individuals who have been infected with the disease and are capable of spreading the disease to those in the susceptible category), and the removed (R) (individuals who have been infected and then removed from the disease. Those in this category are not able to be infected again or transmit the infection to others). The transmission dynamics of an infectious disease is described by modeling the population movements among those epidemiological compartments. In these types of models, individuals develop an immunity to some diseases such as chicken pox and SARS. In addition, contacts between infected and susceptible individuals can take part in the spread of the epidemic.",

Spatial heterogeneity requires a formulation of a small model for each region (city, or state, etc). One possible approach is to consider the travel of individuals between discrete geographical regions (subdomains of domain of study), assuming that the transmission does not take place during travel. For diseases that affect animals and insects (vectors), and can also be passed on to humans [4], it is important to accurately model not only the contact/mixing between humans and the various species, but also the movement patterns of each of the species involved, including humans.",

Before the diagnosis of that disease, infected people moved from one city to another. After some infected cases were diagnosed, and the problem was recognized, it took some time until the political decision was made to ban all movements. At that time, the infected cases had already been divided among a large number of regions. The problem was exacerbated. Then, in order to control the spatial spread of the disease, it has became necessary to consider all parts that people can visit. Hence, this study showcases the significance of integration of spatial dynamics in mathematical models of the spread of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "There are different approaches to model the evolution of infectious diseases in discrete time. The recurrent difference equations from the discretisation of continuous differential equation models is one of the direct modeling approaches and frequently used, since this type of model can be well understood in the application under reasonable assumptions knowing that there are limits on the range of parameters [13, 14]. We will use this approach to formulate the model considered in this paper. Optimal control theory is well used as an available and effective option for diseases control, mainly Tuberculosis [16\u201320], Malaria [21, 22], HIV [23\u201331], Hepatitis [32, 33], Vector borne diseases [34], Cancer [35\u201340], and other diseases [41\u201347], but there are very few applications with both space and time as discrete variables. The aforementioned studies, especially those related to infectious diseases, have mainly focused on the optimization of the intervention for single region, rather than the intervention for multiple regions, hence, this work has a novel control application in addition to providing a framework to analyze spatial control strategies. The aim of this work is not to consider a special disease but to set up an optimal control problem relative to multi-regional discrete-time SIR model, applicable for any type of infectious diseases. Firstly, we represent the percentage of vaccinated susceptible populations as a control function of time in the SIR model corresponding to the targeted region aiming to control. Hence, the purpose of this optimal control (vaccination) strategy is to minimize the infected and susceptible individuals, and to maximize the total number of recovered individuals in that region by using the minimum possible cost of applying this control and simultaneously, to investigate the sensitivity of the susceptible individuals by the control (vaccination). We illustrate how the optimal control theory and the percentage of the vaccination (control) variables can be applied to minimize the susceptible and infected individuals and increase the removed ones.",

Secondly, another control variable is added, characterizing the travel-blocking operation which attempts to block contacts between susceptibles of the controlled region (by vaccination) and infected individuals of domains at high-risk. We derive the optimality system for the multi-regional SIR model with the percentage of vaccinated individuals and travel-blocking operation. Then we find an optimal control strategy for this model and solve numerically this system by using an iterative procedure.",

In the first part, only one control that characterizes the effectiveness of vaccination is used, and where the optimal control problem was subject of an optimization criterion represented by the minimization of an objective function aiming to minimize the number of infected people and the cost of vaccination while maximizing the number of removed people in the targeted region aiming to control. Numerical results, associated to this first part, showed the effectiveness of this vaccination while the targeted region was still sensitive to infection rates in its neighboring domains at high-risk. Then, we extended the first part to a second part by adding a travel-blocking control, in which we have controlled contacts between susceptible people of the controlled region (by vaccination) and the infected of domains at high-risk of infection. We showed the advantage of each case studied with a comparison between the numerical simulations they provided. We have identified optimal control strategies for several values of the controls severity weights to show the importance and the effectiveness of our approach in controlling the infection spread. Control programs that follow those strategies can effectively reduce the number of infected cases and increase the number of the removed individuals in a specific region.",
