Bringing awareness contributes a lot in controlling any pandemic. Covid-19 has been causing severe loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and the level of severity of this disease, it is extremely important to make people aware of various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining social distancing, that are to be followed to prevent the disease and break the chain of spread. This mode of educating individuals about the disease is being widely carried out as announcements through online or physical awareness campaigns, advertisements in the media and so on. The younger generations in the present day spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games. However, there are very few mobile applications or games, aimed to bring awareness about a pandemic, which is much lesser in case of Covid-19. Also, considering the lockdown scenario across the world, games also act as a good pass time indoors. Hence, we propose a 2D survival based game, SurviveCovid-19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19 outside their homes, by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android based mobile game and has been evaluated through a remote qualitative user survey, with 20 volunteers. The results of the survey are promising with all the questions of survey having mean value greater than 3.6.",

Some of these diseases have qualified to be termed as epidemics and some to be termed as pandemics based on the speed and area of their spread. According to the guidelines specified by WHO 1 ((World Health Organization)), the pandemic phase of a disease, most commonly, influenza, begins when the same virus causes community level outbreaks in more than two countries, across different WHO regions. The world has witnessed several pandemics such as Cholera [Colwell (1996) ; Mutreja et al. (2011) ], H1N1 [Xu et al. (2010) ], Smallpox [Cunha (2004) ; Li et al. (2007) ], Ebola [Richard-son et al. (2016) ] and so on [Hays (2005) ]. One of the important lessons learned from these pandemics is the role of awareness campaigns. It has been observed that public awareness campaigns help in reducing the severity of the outcomes of disease, which include hospitalization and death [Mytton, Rutter, and Donaldson (2012) ]. Several governments across the world and researchers have highlighted the need for improvement of public health awareness and education campaigns, aimed towards improving health literacy among the people [Eastwood, Durrheim, Butler, and Jones (2010) ]. Health professionals across various nations have been advised to practice several control activities including basic sanitation facilities, identify and isolate suspected cases and educate general public through awareness campaigns [Sepulveda, Valdespino, and Garcia-Garcia (2006) ]. Along with the medical care required, it is important that all individuals across the world are aware of the safety precautions to be followed during the pandemic.",

This was later identified to be caused due to a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 . This disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 has been named as Covid-19 by WHO in February,2020. Covid-19 has spread rapidly, affecting more than 1.9 million people, spread across several countries of the world, as reported by WHO, as of 16 April,2020 [Organization et al. (2020b) ]. It has spread on a large scale in a very short span of time, ranging from 0.16 million cases [Organization et al. (2020a) ] as of 16 March,2020 to 1.9 million cases [Organization et al. (2020b) ] as of 16 April,2020, resulting in a rise of 1087% cases in a span of one month (from 16 March,2020 to 16 April,2020). Symptoms of Covid-19 include fever, cough, dyspnoea, lymphocytopenia and fatigue [Zhou et al. (2020) ]. It is observed to weaken the immune system of victims and consequently increase the complications in patients suffering with diabetes, cardiovascular problems and chronic kidney diseases, leading to heart failures, kidney failures, respiratory failures and even death in some cases [Zhou et al. (2020) ] [Zheng, Ma, Zhang, and Xie (2020) ]. The number of deaths caused due to Covid-19 have increased from 6.6K to 130.8K during 16 March 2020 to 16 April 2020 2 . Several measures to control the Covid-19 pandemic are being taken by WHO and various nations across the world Sohrabi et al. (2020) . These measures include expediting diagnosis and contact tracing process, increasing health care facilities and scaling up health care equipment, encouraging the process of discovering drugs to treat Covid-19 and bringing awareness among the public 3 . Several governments in the world have issued lockdown instructions, to prevent spread of disease through public gatherings.",

It assesses the food intake of users based on three images, clicked from three different perspectives, or a short video of the food being consumed. The type of food in the image or video is classified by comparing result of feature matching with different types of food stored in food and nutrition database. The volume of the food is identified through geometry calibration and 3D reconstruction. An estimation of number of calories being consumed based on the type of food and volume generated, is presented to the users, which helps them in assessing the calorie intake, and consequently manage their diet [Kong and Tan (2012) ]. Studies also reveal that more than 70% of users, using weight loss reduction mobile applications show successful weight reduction [Chin et al. (2016) ]. These studies thus imply the positive outcomes of using mobile applications in health care. iPhysioMeter has been proposed as a smartphone program (on iPhone 4 , 4S and 5) to measure heart rate(HR) and normalized pulse volume(NPV) [Matsumura and Yamakoshi (2013) ]. The HR and NPV values are calculated by the program when users tap on the iPhone home screen and cover the flash LED and CMOS camera with their left index finger. The results of measurements are sent to the users' email [Matsumura and Yamakoshi (2013) ].",

Also, several educational games have been evaluated based on usability and player experience. Hence, we have evaluated SurviveCovid-19 to understand its usability, usefulness and player experience. We considered 20 volunteers in the age group of 17-25 years and conducted a remote qualitative user survey based on usability, usefulness and player experience factors. The volunteers were requested to download the SurviveCovid-19 application and install the same on their Android mobile phones. A 5-point Likert Scale based questionnaire as shown in Table 1 , has been sent to all the participants as a user survey. The participants were asked to play the game and provide their feedback by answering the questionnaire presented in the user survey. Table 1 indicates the results of user survey in terms of mean and standard deviation of each question in the questionnaire. It can be observed that the mean for all the questions is greater than 3.5, indicating the positive experience of users. Figure 9 , depicts the mean and standard deviation values for each of the three quality factors. Mean value of 3.7 for Usability indicates that most of the volunteers found SurviveCovid-19 easy and attractive. The mean value for Usefulness is greater than 4, indicating that most of the volunteers intended to follow the safety measures against Covid-19 while playing the game. Player Experience factor having mean value greater than 3.9 reveals that majority of the volunteers found SurviveCovid-19 to be interesting to play and were willing to recommend SurviveCovid-19 to their peers. Participants also suggested that :",

The game has been designed in a way to enforce the players follow safety measures to stay safe from Covid-19 when outdoors. Thus, the developed prototype version of SurviveCovid-19 aims to educate players about precautions to be taken towards Covid-19 and also serves as a pass time during the lockdown situations that are prevailed due to Covid-19. Though this game has been developed to address the younger generations of society, it can be played by a wide range audience, irrespective of any social or educational backgrounds. The only requirement of the game is that the players are expected to be equipped with using a mobile phone. The current version of SurviveCovid-19 being a basic prototype, has only one level. However, further levels can easily be added to the game and difficulty level could also be increased with every level being added. Also, the existing SurviveCovid-19 application can be played only on Android based mobile devices. The future versions of the game could be made compatible to mobile devices operating on other operating systems such as Apple and Windows.",

Public Awareness Campaingns are considered as one of the most important measures to be taken across the world in cases of a pandemic or a disease outbreak [Mytton et al. (2012) , Eastwood et al. (2010) ]. The current outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic requires all individuals across the world to be aware of precautions to be followed to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Large scale public health awareness campaigns are being carried out by almost all the governments and various organizations across the world, including WHO to control Covid-19. Considering the large amount of time spent by younger generations on mobile apps and games in the present day, and the effect of games on players' attitude [Chan et al. (2017) , Orji et al. (2013) ], it could be useful to introduce mobile games that contribute towards public health awareness. SurviveCovid-19 aims to educate people about the safety measures to be followed during Covid-19 and motivates them to follow the precautions in real time. We have evaluated SurviceCovid-19 based on usability, usefulness and player experience quality factors. The evaluation was done through a remote qualitative user survey with 20 volunteers, and obtained positive feedback with 80% of volunteers willing to recommend SurviveCovid-19 to their peers.",
