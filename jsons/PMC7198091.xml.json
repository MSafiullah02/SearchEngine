For the Italian FCV-19S, the items were independently translated by a mother-tongue translator and internationally accepted practices for translation were employed (Beaton et al. 2000). Additionally, the Italian FCV-19S was piloted on 15 participants of different ages and education levels to investigate if there were any problems in understanding the items themselves (see Appendix). To avoid the effect of the order and the sequence, the order of presentation of scales and the items within the surveys was randomized.",

More specifically, using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, all items were distributed in a non-normal way (p < .01). Moreover, the Italian FCV-19S appeared to have a unidimensional structure (i.e., a single factor). Additionally, by analyzing the Italian FCV-19S, it had eigenvalues > 1 in a single factor model (see Gorsuch 1983) which suggests one factor as the optimal usable model (more specifically, the eigenvalues = 4.60 with a proportion of variance of 0.657).",

In this specific case, since the items (see Table 1) were distributed in a non-normal way (some items out of the range of \u00b1 1 [see Muth\u00e9n and Kaplan 1985; Tabachnick and Fidell 2007]), parallel analysis/diagonally weighted least squares method (DWLS, polychoric correlation) was used (Mindrila 2010). The results showed the following: \u03c72 = 26.07 (df = 12, n = 249), p = .011 with \u03c72/df = 2.16, the ratio of \u03c72 to degrees of freedom [df] < 3 to consider the data-model fit as acceptable (Kline 2011); chi-square test is very sensitive to the size of the sample, so several indices were used (Kline 2016), TLI = 99, CFI = 99, RMSEA = 0.069 (90% confidence interval, lower limit 0.032, upper limit 0.105, p = .173, i.e., not significant for p = .01) and SRMR = 0.047 (Hu and Bentler 1999). The explained common variance (ECV) was 74.31% (Fornell and Larcker 1981). The factorial validity of FCV-19S was supported by the results (Cerny and Kaiser 1977; Kaiser 1974). The obtained indices were sufficient and all factor loadings were high on all items (min = 0.688, max = 0.897; i.e., \u03bbij \u2265 0.50, [Ferguson and Cox 1993]). Furthermore, the modification indices suggest that there was covariance between Item 1 (\u201cI am most afraid of coronavirus-19\u201d) and Item 5 (\u201cWhen watching news and stories about coronavirus-19 on social media, I become nervous or anxious\u201d) and between Item 2 (\u201cIt makes me uncomfortable to think about coronavirus-19\u201d) and Item 7 (\u201cMy heart races or palpitates when I think about getting coronavirus-19\u201d).",

Concurrent validity was supported by the HADS (anxiety and depression levels among participants) and SMSP-A (phobia among participants) as indicated by the significant positive correlations for both scales (p < .001). More specifically, the FCV-19S positively correlated with the HADS (r = .649) and the SMSP-A (r = .703). To analyze the reliability of the measure and internal consistency, Cronbach\u2019s alpha, Factor Determinacy Index, and composite reliability (Raykov 1997) were used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha in the present study was 0.871 and could not be improved by removing any items. The Factor Determinacy Index was 0.966 and the composite reliability was 0.907.

Psychometric analyses showed the Italian FCV-19S\u2019s good internal reliability and consistency. Construct validity was confirmed by the significant correlation with HADS (which assesses the general level of anxiety and depression) and SMSP-A (which assesses the level of severity of the specific phobia). This is in accordance with previous literature (e.g., Brannon and Schuyler 2000; American Psychiatric Association 2013) according to which specific phobias are often comorbid with anxiety (which is unsurprising given that phobias can be considered as a defense by individuals from anxiety; Greenson 1959). In fact, a significant positive correlation between FCV-19S scores and scores on the HADS and SMSP-A was observed, confirming the scale\u2019s convergent validity.",

This suggests that the Italian FCV-19S can be used to assess psychological issues caused by COVID-19 diffusion among all ages. Although no formal diagnoses concerning mood disorders were obtained (e.g., anxiety, depression), scores on the FCV-19S were significantly and positively related to scores assessing depression and anxiety (HADS) and the severity of the specific phobia (SMSP-A); therefore, individuals with severe fear of COVID-19 may be affected by these disorders co-morbidly. This is in accordance with previous literature indicating that, during long periods of infectious epidemics, individuals\u2019 psychophysical health can be affected by negative psychological states (e.g., anxiety, depression, and phobias; Duncan et al. 2009; Pappas et al. 2009; Ropeik 2004). Besides generating concerns on a physical and psychological healthcare level, COVID-19 has also resulted in social issues, which have been previously associated with an acceleration of an infectious disease\u2019s spread (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020a, b; Bloom and Cadarette 2019). For instance, an epidemic can overload a nation\u2019s healthcare system, especially in poor public health contexts (Bloom and Cadarette 2019), limiting the ability of operators to deal with the problem and increasing the stress levels of both citizens and healthcare workers. In turn, stress has been previously shown to worsen both the physical and mental health of individuals, often resulting in increased use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020c) and negatively affecting the immune system, making people more vulnerable to disease (e.g., Morey et al. 2015). Moreover, fear experienced during an epidemics has been previously associated with the stigmatization of citizens perceived as being the source of the disease, with the risk of resulting in scuffles or, in extreme cases, civil conflicts (Pappas et al. 2009; Falagas and Kiriaze 2006). Therefore, the Italian version of FCV-19S could help the general public to better understanding emotional factors correlated with the pandemic and (with a joint effort by those working in medical and psychological healthcare) ultimately lead to a better health outcome for the entire population affected.",

First, the participant pool only comprised a self-selected sample from the general Italian population with a majority being female (and therefore, tests for gender differences were not possible). Second, no formal diagnosis of mood disorders was undertaken. Third, it cannot be excluded that social desirability factors might have influenced participant responses to the questionnaire. Further investigation on bigger and more representative samples of Italian participants is needed to confirm the preliminary results provided by the present study (e.g., a nationally representative sample with more male participants). However, total scores on the FCV-19S were comparable across all ages, which suggests that the Italian FCV-19S is a good psychometric instrument to be used in assessing fears of COVID-19 among Italian individuals.",

Moreover, future research including a larger and more representative sample should further investigate the apparent covariance between Item 1 and Item 5 and between Item 2 and Item 7. Preliminary covariance results may, in fact, be due to different factors, such as (i) an underlying factor that was not considered in the present model, (ii) the sample size, (iii) the imbalance of the sample\u2019s gender composition, (iv) idiosyncratic characteristics of the sample, and (v) the semantic similarity between the items in Italian context (Whittaker 2012). Nonetheless, the psychometric testing of the Italian FCV-19S demonstrates that the instrument is psychometrically robust and assesses a unidimensional construct. In short, the Italian FCV-19S is a reliable and valid tool for assessing the severity of fear of COVID-19 among Italian adults.",
