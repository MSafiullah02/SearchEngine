The presence of IgM increases the 51 chance that the tested person is still contagious. 4 52 We suggest that, if rapid antibody testing and personnel are available, algorithms for care before 53 outpatient and inpatient care of pregnant women be implemented as suggested in Figure 2. At our 54 institution, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at University of Naples Federico II 55 (Naples, Italy), all pregnant women are tested with the rapid combined antibody test before hospital 56 admission. If the rapid antibody test is positive to either SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG, we do offer 57 the NP swab and consider these women COVID-19 positive until the result of the NP swab is 58 available. Patients positive to the rapid combined antibody test are isolated, and inpatient admission 59 is postponed waiting the results of the NP swab, if feasible (e.g. planned cesarean delivery, 60 induction of labor, surgical procedure). If it is not feasible to postpone the admission (e.g. laboring 61 or bleeding pregnant women), the patient is admitted to the COVID unit, and managed as COVID-62 19 positive (Figure 2A). For example, in our Department, recently two pregnant women with 63 positive IgG and IgM had admission to the hospital postponed of 24 hours while awaiting the NP 64 swab test result. In another patient, who tested positive for IgM, postponed hospital admission was 65 not feasible due to heavy bleeding in a first trimester spontaneous abortion. The patient received NP 66 swab and was admitted to the COVID unit where she received dilation and curettage.
