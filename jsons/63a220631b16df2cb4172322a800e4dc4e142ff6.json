            "text": "Theoretical conceptions of the role of universities in local innovation systems have evolved over the past 20 years, from an initial approach that stressed the importance of knowledge spillovers from university educational and research activities into their regional knowledge spaces, towards a new emphasis on the \"third role\" of universities, as animators of regional economic and social development. However the typical conception is that universities and research centres in developing countries take little part in stimulating the formation of LISs, with this mission instead being substituted by the state or large companies. This chapter analyses the role and the mechanisms through which universities can contribute to creation of LISs, first from a theoretical point of view. The theoretical arguments are then supported by an analysis of the role of the National University of Singapore, in driving the development of the \"Biopolis\" biotech LIS.",

            "text": "There are two dominant approaches to perceiving this role: the triple helix model of university, industry and government relations, and the concept of the \"engaged university\", expressed in a second body of literature. The two concepts overlap, but also have important differences in emphasis. Both bodies of thought stress that universities are increasingly linked to place but they offer different analyses of the driving forces in the relationship. Further, there are significant differences in their assumptions regarding institutional norms and behaviours. The triple helix model (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1997) brought attention to the role of universities in regional economies, anticipating the multiplying incidence of hybrid university-industry-government relationships, as seen in recent resource and capital development projects. Particularly interesting among these projects are those involving property development for science parks and incubator facilities, to favour new firm formation (Etzkowitz 2002: 14) . The triple helix model offers a conceptualisation of innovation as occurring through non-linear, interactive processes, in a \"recursive overlap of interactions and negotiations among universities, industry and government\" (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1997) . One of the key insights of the model is that of the hybrid, repetitively growing, inter-institutional nature of relations among the \"three helices\". Instead of the traditional situation in which the institutional spheres of the state, university and industry were separate entities that interacted across strongly defended boundaries, the individuals and organisations within these helices are seen as taking different and mixed roles (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1999: 113; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1997; Sutz 1997) .",

However it differs in emphasising the \"adaptive responses\" open to universities as they embed a stronger regional focus in their teaching and research missions. The approach does not eschew the development of hybrid, boundary-spanning mechanisms for external engagement, but it inserts this into a broader, developmental approach that considers a range of mechanisms through which universities can engage with their regions (Power and Malmberg 2008) . Universities, through their resource base of people, skills and knowledge, increasingly play a diversity of roles in regional networking and institutional capacity building. Staff, acting in both formal and informal capacities, act as \"regional animators\" (Chatterton and Goddard 2000: 481) through their insertion in outside bodies ranging from school boards and local authorities to cultural organisations and development agencies. Universities thereby make an important indirect contribution to the social and cultural basis of effective regional governance. In general, the developmental role of universities in regional economic and social development centres on the intersection of learning economies and the regionalisation of production and regulation.",

First, they can enhance the regional knowledge base through their international academic networks, serving as gateways for local businesses to reach external knowledge (Altbach 1998: 179; Fritsch and Schwirten 1998) . Second, they can adapt knowledge from extra-regional sources to produce new forms that are more appropriate for the local innovation system. In doing so, they reduce entry costs for new technologies and open windows of opportunity for catch-up processes (Perez and Soete 1988: 476) . Third, within the centralised character typical of innovation systems in developing countries, public universities usually enjoy greater autonomy than do other regional actors, maintaining substantial levels of control over their financial, personnel, and academic affairs. Universities that are fully or partially incorporated tend to establish even greater levels of independence, and are capable of responding still more efficiently to regional needs. Bernardes and Albuquerque (2003: 868-870) conclude that linkages and feedback mechanisms among universities and industry have to be established in coevolution, during the catching-up processes. In the worst case, purely education-led growth will encounter a dead end if the university outputs have not been correlated to needs in the productive sector.",

For example for many years, the Economic Development Board has offered incentives to large foreign corporations to either relocate or build their regional R&D centres in Singapore. As a result, foreign corporations and large local enterprises accounted for 85.7 % of industry R&D expenditure from 2002 to 2010.

NUS is also the nation's most comprehensive university, followed by the other two public universities, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University, both of which are younger than the NUS. Historically, government policies have emphasised public education. As a result there are no large private Singaporean universities, although there are many diploma-level private colleges and distance-learning programs. However since the late 1990s, the government had encouraged leading overseas universities to establish branch campuses and other operational presences in Singapore. Until 1991 public R&D was concentrated in the higher education sector, particularly in the NUS, as well as in a small number of government agencies (Wong and Singh 2005) . NUS has historically played a key role in Singapore's knowledge creation. It is consistently ranked as one of the top universities in Asia and is internationally respected for its high-quality research in science, technology and the humanities, and increasingly for research at the interfaces between these areas. The institution includes 16 schools and faculties, and 23 university-level research institutes and centres, focused on critical issues confronting Asia and the world. The university is also home to three of Singapore's five \"Research Centres of Excellence\" (RCEs), specialising in quantum technologies, cancer and mechanobiology, and is a partner in a fourth national RCE on environmental life sciences and engineering. According to the Nature Publishing Index (NPI) Asia-Pacific 2012, NUS is Singapore's leading research institution. It is ranked ninth in the Asia-Pacific region and is the first Singapore institution to enter the NPI Global Top 100, ranking in 76th position.",

This previous experience demonstrated the need for greater focus, particularly in the biotechnology sector, and thus opened the road for the creation of Biopolis. The NUS participated directly in the preliminary phases of the BMS through the participation of Tan Chorh Chuan, dean of the medical faculty. NUS also anticipated and stimulated the formation of Biopolis through its long-standing educational role in the sector, producing the necessary experts. As early as 1983, the university had modified its teaching program to focus more closely on biology, and had introduced microbiology as a separate discipline instead of considering it as dependent on biology. As a result, the class hours in microbiology for second and third year students were more than doubled. However changes to the undergraduate curriculum only partly addressed the rising needs in biotechnology, as an emerging, research-intensive field. In fact one year later, a state administrator (Chua Sia Eng, Commissioner of the Parks and Recreation Department) provided a valedictory address for NUS science and pharmacy graduates in which he insisted that the graduates go on to join R&D programs in biotechnology so that Singapore could develop a strong base to tap the vast potential of this science. His call to science and pharmacy graduates to join postgraduate courses was intended to drive home the urgency for qualified biotechnology experts, but in truth seems to have preceded any substantial opening of genuine biotech-centred postgraduate opportunities. This was one of the motivations given for the setting up of the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in early 1985. According to NUS's vicechancellor at the time, the new institute was intended not only to train a pool of competent manpower to service the biotechnology industry, but also offer true research careers to NUS graduates in chemistry and microbiology.",

The NUS also provides advisory services for students to assist them in identifying the paths that will develop the necessary knowledge, skills and contacts for their entrepreneurial initiatives. The NUS Overseas College offers potential entrepreneurs the possibility to broaden their contacts through continuous cooperation and learning in the field, working alongside actors who have created successful start-ups both in Singapore and in other nations. In this way, the NUS offers its student entrepreneurs the possibility of developing not only specialised scientific knowledge, but also the knowledge of business fundamentals necessary for development of their own activities. The NUS has also created Start-Up@Singapore (S@S), an instrument for stimulation and participation in development of territorial start-ups. Start-Up@ Singapore stimulates development of innovative ideas and encourages healthy competition between potential entrepreneurs by organising \"global business plan\" competitions that offer the winners financing to continue with their innovative activity. As of 2012, the S@S competition was in its 14th edition, representing a total of more than 3,500 teams and 10,000 individual participants, and had helped to spin off more than 90 start-ups. These have included award-winning businesses such as tenCube, FriarTuck, PerceptiveI, World Indigo, PurpleAce and Quantagen.

In addition, Veredus has produced the world's first validated commercial avian flu diagnostic kit, which cuts the time for accurate detection of the H5N1 virus from 7 days to as little as two. As of 2013, the company was also developing kits for encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, chicken pox and SARS.",

A new drug with a novel mechanism for preventing the condition was first discovered by Sim Meng Kwoon, an assistant professor in the NUS department of pharmacology. The drug des-aspartate-angiotensin I (DAA-I) acts on a receptor coupled to a specific prostaglandin pathway to suppress clot formation. The highly specific pathway limits any negative secondary effects. Currently, metal stents that are inserted into patients' blood vessels after angioplasty are coated with a bio-degradable polymer impregnated with drugs to prevent restenosis. However the existing stent drugs like Sirolimus and Paclitaxel are nonspecific immunosuppressant and anti-cancer drugs, which can also affect other cells.",

The agreement was the first ever case where a Singapore drug innovation will enter global commercialised through the United States. It is also the first ever case where a specific new anti-restenosis drug is being incorporated into an equally new Medlogics technology. Medlogics has a proprietary coating technology that enables the drugs to be applied directly to the stent metal, avoiding the use of biodegradable polymers. The technology reduces the cost of making the drug-coated stents, ensures consistent release of drugs, and reduces the inflammation caused by the polymers. Medlogics selected DAA-I as the first drug for application with the new technology, out of a short list of seven final candidates.",
