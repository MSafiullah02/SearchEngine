He emphasized the importance of the interaction between nutrients and reviewed the established relationships of vitamin A status to protein, dietary fat, vitamin E, zinc, and iron (92) . Mej\u00eda also mentioned the more controversial links of vitamin A to iodine metabolism; vitamins C, K, and D; calcium, and copper. Realizing that the relationships might be direct or indirect, he emphasized the importance of considering these interactions when \"treating or preventing vitamin A deficiency both at the clinical and at the population levels\" (ref. 92, p. 95) . Olson (155) reported that deficiencies of various other nutrients, including protein, \u03b1-tocopherol (vitamin E), iron, and zinc, adversely affects the transportation, storage, and utilization of vitamin A. He also noted that the absorption of vitamin A and carotenoids is markedly reduced when diets contain very little fat (<5 g/d).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 165, "text": "(92,", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 166, "end": 170, "text": "131,", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 171, "end": 175, "text": "132,", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 176, "end": 180, "text": "134,", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 181, "end": 186, "text": "(155)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 187, "end": 192, "text": "(156)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 193, "end": 198, "text": "(157)", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 199, "end": 204, "text": "(158)", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 225, "end": 235, "text": "Mej\u00eda (92)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 619, "end": 623, "text": "(92)", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 986, "end": 996, "text": "92, p. 95)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 999, "end": 1010, "text": "Olson (155)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Deficiencies of Multiple Micronutrients"}, {"text": "More recently, Villamor and Fawzi (132) stated that supplementation with vitamins and minerals in addition to vitamin A is likely to \"reduce the burden of adverse health outcomes,\" because of the physiological interactions between nutrients and overlapping micronutrient deficiencies, including iron and zinc.
