As of March 19, 2020, Singapore has had 330 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. 1 Singapore detected the first case of COVID-19 on January 23, 2020, and had the highest number of COVID-19 cases outside of mainland China from February 7, 2020, to February 20, 2020. 2 Since the start of February 2020, we have instituted significant changes to our routine vascular surgical service. We adopted a split-team policy and encouraged complete team segregation to reduce the risk of intradepartmental cross-contamination. We conducted phone interviews with outpatients to determine whether their appointment can be postponed, reducing their need to visit the hospital. Last, we rescheduled elective cases and performed only emergency surgery to preserve hospital resources such as intensive care unit beds.",

            "text": "To understand more about the global impact of COVID-19 on vascular surgical services, we designed a questionnaire that addressed four pertinent themes including outpatient services, inpatient care, elective surgery, and emergency surgery. The questionnaire consisted of seven multiple choice questions and three open-ended questions (Appendix, online only). The questionnaire was targeted at vascular surgeons and was distributed online in vascular surgery interest groups using various social media platforms. The questionnaire was open from March 16 to March 20, 2020, and did not collect any identifiable data. Valid responses were represented as categorical data and presented in percentages. A total of 77 individual responses were obtained. Of these, 29 (37.7%) were from the European Union, 12 (15.6%) were from Southeast Asia, 10 (13.0%) were from the United Kingdom, 10 (13.0%) were from the Middle East, 7 (9.1%) were from the United States of America, and 9 (11.7%) were from other countries. Of the 77 respondents, 45 (58.4%) were working in a split-team fashion. When asked about outpatient services, 69 (89.6%) replied that outpatient services were either suspended or scaled down. When asked about inpatient services, 61 (79.2%) replied that inpatient services were either suspended or scaled down. With regard to elective vascular surgical cases, 70 (90.9%) replied that at least some if not all elective cases were cancelled. The majority of cases cancelled were varicose vein surgery, revascularization for claudication, \"small\" or asymptomatic aortic aneurysms, dialysis access work, and asymptomatic carotid stenoses. On the contrary, 71 of 77 respondents (92.2%) are still performing all emergency vascular surgery (Fig) .",
