Classification allows the orderly grouping of micro-organisms, whereas nomenclature concerns the naming of these organisms and requires agreement so that the same name is used unambiguously by everyone. Changes in nomenclature may give rise to confusion and are subject to internationally agreed rules. In clinical practice, microbiologists are generally concerned with identification \u2013 the correct naming of isolates according to agreed systems of classification. These components, together with taxonomy, make up the overarching discipline of systematics, which is concerned with evolution, genetics and speciation of organisms, and is commonly referred to as phylogenetics.",

Large subdivisions (class, order, family, etc.) are finally classified into individual species designated by a Latin binomial, the first term of which is the genus, e.g. Plasmodium (genus) falciparum (species).

To date, identification has predominantly been performed by the use of keys that allow the organization of bacterial traits based on growth or activity in systems that test their biochemical properties. Some tests are definitive of a genus or species, for example the universal production of catalase enzyme and cytochrome c, respectively, by Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other characters may be unique to individual species and serve to differentiate them from organisms with closely similar biochemical activity profiles. Some bacteria do not grow in the laboratory (leprosy bacillus, treponemes), and identification by genetic methods may be necessary. As the technologies for genetic analysis become more readily applicable in clinical labs, so they and other rapid analytical methods, such as those based on mass spectrometry, are coming to replace the traditional biochemical methods to achieve identification. The taxonomic ranks used in the classification of bacteria are (example in parentheses):\u2022Kingdom (Prokaryotae)\u2022Division (Gracilicutes)\u2022Class (Betaproteobacteria)\u2022Order (Burkholderiales)\u2022Family (Burkholderiaceae)\u2022Genus (Burkholderia)\u2022Species (Burkholderia cepacia).\n",

The relative \u2018importance\u2019 of different characters in defining major and minor groupings is often purely arbitrary. The uncertainties of arbitrary choices are avoided in the Adansonian system of taxonomy. This system determines the degrees of relationship between strains by a statistical coefficient that takes account of the widest range of characters, all of which are considered of equal weight. It is clear, of course, that some characters, for instance cell shape or Gram-stain reaction, represent a much wider and permanent genetic commitment than other characters which, being dependent on only one or a few genes, may be unstable. For this reason, the Adansonian method is most useful for the classification of strains within a larger grouping that shares major characters.",

Thus, the melting or denaturation temperature of DNA (at which the two strands separate) is determined primarily by the G + C content. At the melting temperature, the separation of the strands brings about a marked change in the light absorption characteristics at a wavelength of 260 nm, and this is readily detected by spectrophotometry. There is a very wide range in the G + C component of bacterial DNA, varying from about 25\u201380% mol in different genera. However, for any one species, the G + C content is relatively fixed, or falls within a very narrow range, and this provides a basis for classification.",

This exploits the fact that double strands re-form (anneal) from separated strands during controlled cooling of a heated preparation of DNA. This process can be readily demonstrated with suitably heated homologous DNA extracted from a single species, but it can also occur with DNA from two related species, so that hybrid pairs of DNA strands are produced. These hybrid pairings occur with high frequency between complementary regions of DNA, and the degree of hybridization can be assessed if labelled DNA preparations are used. Binding studies with messenger RNA (mRNA) can also give information to complement these observations, which provide genetic evidence of relatedness among bacteria. Organisms with different G + C ratios are unlikely to show significant DNA homology. However, organisms with the same, or close, G + C ratios do not necessarily show homology. A novel real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (see pp. 31 and 79\u201380) has been described for estimation of G + C content.",

Far fewer full-length gene sequences are known for 23S rRNA than for 16S rRNA and 16S\u201323S internal transcribed sequences. In practice the DNA of the test organism is extracted and amplified by PCR using universal primers. The DNA sequence of the product is determined and the sequence compared against databases to find the closest fit. It is generally accepted that sequence similarity between 0.5% and 1.0% (with the type species) is required for the identification of an unknown organism, and less than 97% similarity is a common cut-off point for the differentiation of species. However, different species of Mycobacterium may exhibit more than 97% similarity in rDNA sequence.

It is usual to test the ability of the organism to produce acidic and gaseous end-products when presented with individual carbohydrates (glucose, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, etc.) as the sole carbon source. Other tests determine whether the bacterium produces particular end-products (e.g. indole or hydrogen sulphide) when grown in suitable culture media, and whether it possesses certain enzyme activities, such as oxidase, catalase, urease, gelatinase or lecithinase. Traditionally, such tests have been performed selectively and individually according to the recommendations of standard guides, such as the invaluable Cowan and Steel's Manual for the Identification of Medical Bacteria. However, today most diagnostic laboratories use commercially prepared microgalleries of identification tests which, though expensive, combine simplicity and accuracy. Test kits are now available for a number of different groups of organisms, including enterobacteria, staphylococci, streptococci and anaerobes. Other kits facilitate the testing of carbon source utilization, the assimilation of specific substrates and the enzymes produced by an organism.",

PCR-mediated DNA fingerprinting makes use of the variable regions in DNA molecules. These may be variable numbers of tandem repeat regions or areas with restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. To perform PCR typing, it is necessary to know the sequences of the bordering regions so that specific oligonucleotide primers can be synthesized. Primers may be specific for a known sequence or be random. Random primers are extensively used in the techniques of random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR). Both of these approaches have problems with reproducibility as a result of false priming, faint versus sharp bands and variation in electrophoretic migration of products. Repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) indexes variation in multiple interspersed repetitive sequences in intergenic regions dispersed throughout the genome. An automated, standardized rep-PCR system has proven useful for strain typing of a number of species and is reported to give similar discrimination to PFGE (Bacterial Barcodes, Houston, Texas, USA).

They are thought to arise through DNA strand slippage during replication and are of unknown function. Separate VNTR loci are identified from published sequences and are often located in intergenic regions and annotated open reading frames. Primers are designed to amplify five to eight loci and the products sequenced to generate a digital profile. VNTR typing is rapid and reproducible, and relatively simple to perform. Improved discrimination may be achieved by identification of more loci but there is debate about their stability over time.",

These massively parallel sequencing technologies produce relatively short nucleotide sequence reads but on such a scale that these can be assembled into a sequence matched against those obtained from previous isolates of that organism. This enables a genome-wide comparison to be made and a more or less definitive evolutionary relationship to be established to other contemporaneous and historical isolates. The costs of such analyses are rapidly becoming competitive with traditional typing methods. Such analyses have the potential to transform medical bacteriology by producing unambiguous epidemiological information and by identifying genetic elements such as those encoding antibiotic resistance and significant antigens under selection pressures.",
