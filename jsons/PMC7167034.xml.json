The truncated receptor, designated IFN\u2010\u03b3R1\u0394IC (Dighe et al., 1995), has only three amino acids of the intracellular domain while retaining the IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 extracellular and transmembrane domains, abrogating intracellular signaling. The extracellular domain retains ligand binding activity and contains a human c\u2010myc tag. The IFN\u2010\u03b3R1\u0394IC transgene was initially excised from plasmid pSFFV.myc\u2010mgR\u0394IC. A 1\u2010kb EcoR I fragment was first subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a BamH I/Hind III fragment subsequently cloned into pRSGFP\u2010C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A BamH I/Bgl II fragment was finally subcloned into the gfa2\u2010lacZ plasmid (Brenner et al., 1994), containing the gfa2 promoter (Fig. 1). The BamH I/Bgl II\u2010flanked IFN\u2010\u03b3R1\u0394IC fragment places the transgene coding region between the gfa2 promoter and a region comprising bp +95 to +625 from the mouse protamine\u20101 (mp1) structural gene, which provides an intron and 3\u2032\u2010untranslated and poly\u2010A sequences (Fig. 1). An approximately 3.7\u2010kb Bgl II fragment containing the promoter, transgene, and 3\u2032 regulatory regions was purified from plasmid pGfa2/IFN\u2010\u03b3R1\u0394IC, injected into the pronuclei of B6 \u00d7 CBA F1 fertilized oocytes, which were transferred into pseudopregnant B6 \u00d7 CBA F1 mice.",

These data suggest that expression of the GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 transgene mRNA is restricted to the CNS and does not result in any clinically apparent phenotype or adversely affect astrocyte development.",

To demonstrate functional transgene expression, astrocytes in mixed glial cultures derived from tg and wt mice were incubated in the presence or absence of IFN\u2010\u03b3, and class II expression was analyzed by flow cytometry after 48 hr of induction. Cultures containing 30\u201340% CD45+ microglia were examined for IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced class II expression to provide an internal control population. No class II expression was detected on untreated CD45\u2212 astrocytes (Fig. 5A) or microglia (data not shown) from wt or tg mice. By contrast, IFN\u2010\u03b3 induced class II expression on both astrocytes and microglia derived from wt mice. MHC class II induction on microglia obtained from the CNS of wt and GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 tg mice was similar with respect both to the percentage of microglia expressing class II and to the level of expression based on mean fluorescent intensity (data not shown). IFN\u2010\u03b3 induction of class II on microglia peaked within the first 36 hr of stimulation and then declined at 48 hr, resulting in expression on approximately 20% of microglial cells at 48 hr postinduction (data not shown).

No differences in T cell proliferation (Fig. 6A) or antigen\u2010induced IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion (data not shown) were detected in comparing tg and wt mice. Infection with a neurotropic coronavirus was used to examine potential effects of diminished astrocyte IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling. JHMV infects ependymal cells, astrocytes, microglia, macrophages, and oligodendroglia (Wang et al., 1992; Sun et al., 1995; Bergmann et al., 2004). Infectious JHMV peaks in the CNS at approximately day 6 postinfection (p.i.) and then declines to undetectable levels by approximately 14 days p.i. (Wang et al., 1992; Lin et al., 1997; Parra et al., 1999). Prominent astrocytic infection occurs rapidly, and replication in astrocytes is controlled via a perforin\u2010dependent mechanism mediated by CD8+ T cells (Lin et al., 1997; Bergmann et al., 2004). No differences in clinical disease were noted in comparing JHMV\u2010infected wt and GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 tg mice to day 14 p.i. (data not shown). To determine whether reduced IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling by astrocytes affected virus replication, the levels of infectious virus in the CNS of the tg and wt mice were compared at 7 days p.i. A slight, but not significant, increase in the infectious virus within the CNS of the GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 was detected compared with wt mice (Fig. 6A). Similarly, no difference in bone marrow\u2010derived CD45hi CNS inflammatory cells was detected in comparing GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 tg and wt mice (Fig. 6A), which is consistent with an unaltered immune response to a peripheral antigen (Fig. 6A). To ensure that the relative composition of CNS\u2010infiltrating cells was not altered, the percentage of NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages within the inflammatory population was determined via flow cytometry. Consistent with the similar levels of both infectious virus and overall inflammation, similar NK cell, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and macrophage infiltrates were detected within the CNS of the GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 tg and wt mice (Fig. 6A). Finally, to ensure that transgene expression did not alter virus tropism, the distribution of both virus\u2010infected cells and inflammatory cells was examined. No difference in either the extent or the distribution of either the inflammatory response (Fig. 6B) or the virus\u2010infected astrocytes was detected in comparing GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 tg and wt mice (Fig. 7). Similarly, no differences in inflammation or demyelination were detected in comparing the two groups at day 14 p.i. (data not shown).",

Analysis of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010deficient mice confirmed the critical role of IFN\u2010\u03b3 in regulation of a variety of CNS autoimmune or viral infections, and also highlighted its complexity. For example, although EAE is mediated by IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010secreting Th1 CD4+ T cells, inhibition or absence of IFN\u2010\u03b3 increases disease severity (Billiau et al., 1988; Willenborg et al., 1996). Additionally, during CNS infection with both JHMV and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, viral clearance is IFN\u2010\u03b3 dependent (Parra et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 2003; Bergmann et al., 2004), yet IFN\u2010\u03b3 contributes to virus\u2010induced demyelination (Pewe and Perlman, 2002; Rodriguez et al., 1995). Despite its apparent dual roles as effector and inhibitor in these CNS pathologies, IFN\u2010\u03b3 is clearly critical in controlling virus replication in neurons and oligodendroglia (Parra et al., 1999; Griffin, 2003). Determining the role of IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling in specific cell types in vivo is hampered both by the nearly ubiquitous expression of the IFN\u2010\u03b3R and by the number of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010inducible genes and their downstream products (Benveniste, 1998; Chesler and Reiss, 2002; Schroder et al., 2004), which can be differently regulated in adjacent cells as well as the target cell of interest.",

            "text": "Astrocytes, critical to normal CNS function, may play a major role in regulating immune responses within the CNS. Astrocytes express MHC molecules, required for APC activity, upon stimulation with IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Fierz et al., 1985). In addition, IFN\u2010\u03b3 up\u2010regulates costimulatory molecules required for T cell activation (Nikcevich et al., 1997; Dong and Benveniste, 2001; De Keyser et al., 2003), supporting the concept that antigen presentation by astrocytes might have a pivotal role in CNS immunopathology. Activated astrocytes secrete a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and CXCL10 (Aschner, 1998; Benveniste, 1998; Lane et al., 1998; Dong and Benveniste, 2001), elevated during brain injury, CNS inflammation and degenerative diseases. However, astrocytes also secrete immune mediators with potential antiinflammatory effects, which inhibit microglial activation, phagocytosis, and cytokine secretion (Aloisi et al., 1997; DeWitt et al., 1998). Astrocytes also suppress antigen\u2010specific T cell proliferation via induction of the inhibitory CTLA\u20104 molecule and regulatory T cells (Gimsa et al., 2004; Trajkovic et al., 2004). Thus, depending on context, these data suggest that IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling in astrocytes may result in either pro\u2010 or antiinflammatory outcomes.",

Expression of foreign proteins under control of the GFAP promoter can induce astrocyte impairment structurally and functionally and thus adversely impact the CNS. For example, inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration have all been observed after astrocyte\u2010specific transgenic expression of inflammatory cytokines (Campbell, 1998). Increased secretion of TGF\u2010\u03b2 by astrocytes resulted in hydrocephalus, whereas expression of insulin\u2010like growth factor binding protein\u20106 reduced brain and body weight and decreased the number of astrocytes (Galbreath et al., 1995; Bienvenu et al., 2004). Expression of human GFAP caused severe encephalopathy associated with altered astrocyte morphology, including the presence of inclusion bodies (Messing et al., 1998). Thus, although a variety of abnormalities is associated with expression of some transgenes in astrocytes, the GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 tg mice developed and bred normally and did not exhibit clinical symptoms or abnormalities in astrocyte frequency, distribution, or morphology. Transgene\u2010specific expression by astrocytes was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Although only minimal IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 expression was detected in wt mice, IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 expression by astrocytes was more readily detected in tg mice. However, expression of the accessory IFN\u2010\u03b3R2 remained low on both wt and tg astrocytes, with no simultaneous increase in IFN\u2010\u03b3R1\u0394IC/IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3R2 surface expression as previously noted in mice with targeted expression of the IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 transgene in oligodendroglia (Gonzalez et al., 2005). These data are consistent with the concept that IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3R2 are not preassembled (Bach et al., 1996). Although no increase in IFN\u2010\u03b3R2 was detected, the diminished response to IFN\u2010\u03b3 provides evidence for a functional transgene with impaired IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling. The response to IFN\u2010\u03b3 was substantially reduced in astrocytes derived from the tg mice; however, the response was not completely abolished. Although this suggests that astrocytic responses in these tg mice may be diminished but not completely eliminated, increased transgene expression from the GFAP promoter, for example, during inflammation (Eng and Ghirnikar, 1994), may increase differential responsiveness.",

CXCL10 plays an essential role in the antiviral defense following MHV infection of the CNS (Liu et al., 2000). However, CXCL10 can also be induced in a variety of cells, including astrocytes, upon stimulation with type I interferons (Liu et al., 2000). Consistently with the data suggesting that virus replication is controlled in astrocytes via perforin\u2010mediated cytotoxicity and that MHC class I is regulated by both type I interferons and IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Lin et al., 1997; Parra et al., 1999; Bergmann et al., 2004), no difference in virus replication or cell types infected was detected in comparing JHMV pathogenesis in GFAP\u03b3R1\u0394 tg and wt mice. These data are consistent with induction of MHC class I, required for control of JHMV infection by virus\u2010specific CD8+ T cells, via type I interferon signaling (Atta et al., 1995), a pathway unimpaired in these tg mice. These data suggest that, in contrast to the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010dependent MHC class II expression on astrocytes and microglia (Fierz et al., 1985; Bergmann et al., 2003), MHC class I expression, at least at the minimal levels sufficient for CD8+ T cell recognition, is independent of IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling.",
