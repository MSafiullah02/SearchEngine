The conditions that favor the acquisition of an infecting organism include the behavior of the host, the underlying environment, and the host immune status. When focusing on high-risk individuals, traditionally the focus has often been placed on the underlying host's or the patient's immune status; however, the environment where the infection is acquired is often the risk factor that leads to the acquisition of the infection or the pathogenic organism. This is illustrated by airborne infections being easily transmitted in enclosed settings, such as dormitories, military barracks, prisons, and cruise ships.",

Infections that are easily transmitted in these close settings often tend to have a high morbidity because a large number of individuals get exposed to the infecting organism and very often develop symptomatic infections. It is important that health care professionals have a familiarity with the common infections that can occur in these settings, and recommend appropriate precautions for individuals going to these venues.",

            "text": "The use of cruise ships is a rapidly growing method of travel, with the Passenger Shipping Association estimating that 10 million people traveled on cruise ships in 2000 and that this number will reach 20 million by 2010 [1] . The cruise ship industry has responded to the increasing number of travelers by increasing the size and capacity of cruise ships as exemplified by the recent launch of the liner Queen Mary 2, which has a guest capacity of over 3000 passengers. These modern behemoths are virtual traveling cities with common food and water supplies, shared sanitation and air-conditioning systems, and a large number of individuals traveling together. An infecting agent has the potential to enter either the food and water supply or the sanitation systems in these ships, be distributed widely across the ship, and cause significant morbidity. In addition, the close proximity between the passengers and the crewmembers in semiconfined spaces with interactions in the dining halls and recreational rooms increases the possibility of organisms being transmitted among them. The average cruise passenger is often an elderly individual and may have chronic illnesses, which can lead to them to being more susceptible to an infection and its complications. It is vital to the safety of passengers that any potential for transmission of an infecting agent be minimized on cruise ships.",

These infections tend to have a high attack rate with a large number of individuals being infected before the epidemic is contained. These outbreaks can occur even in summertime, in regions where influenza is not in seasonal circulation. Either the passengers or the crewmembers can introduce the organism into the cruise ship population. It is recommended that passengers at high risk for complications of influenza (eg, persons aged R50 years, immunocompromised persons, and persons with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems) who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the preceding fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccine before travel (1) with large organized tourist groups at any time of year; (2) to the tropics; or (3) to the Southern Hemisphere from April through September (the time of increased influenza activity in that hemisphere) [9] . It is also recommended that cruise lines should attempt to achieve at least an 80% vaccination rate among crew members on each ship each year [10] . These recommendations may be modified if the next pandemic influenza outbreak occurs initially outside the United States, to limit the potential of cruise ships to import the pathogenic organism to the United States. The other respiratory viruses that have caused outbreaks among cruise ships include cases of rubella, although the list is probably underrepresented [11] . A study of the epidemiology of injuries and illnesses among passengers on cruise ships revealed that respiratory tract infections were the most common cause of seeking medical attention by passengers and the crew members aboard the ship [12] .",

There have also been reported cases of vaccine-preventable infections, such as diphtheria and rubella, acquired on cruise ships [10, 16] . The presence of individuals, especially crew members and passengers from different countries, with differing immunization status can lead to transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and rubella, on cruise ships.

This group of viruses is notorious for causing diarrheal diseases in closed settings, such as in nursing homes [18] . There have been multiple outbreaks of these infections on multiple cruise ships over the past years [1, 17, 19] . These infections are often facilitated by the close living quarters, common food supplies, and intermingling of individuals that occur on cruise ships. Several routes including fecaloral transmission, aerosolization while vomiting, food and water as vehicles, and environmental contamination by symptomatic patients or asymptomatic carriers can spread these viruses [13] . The reports in the literature have implicated water supplies, various food items, poor food handling techniques, along with person-to-person spread as methods of transmission of the virus to passengers on cruise ships [1] . The incubation period for noroviral gastroenteritis in humans is usually less than 2 days, although cases can occur within 12 hours after exposure. It presents as acute-onset vomiting, watery nonbloody diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and nausea. Children tend also to have vomiting more commonly but high-grade fever is usually not a feature of this condition and should suggest an alternative etiology. This is a self-limiting condition and usually only requires medical attention for dehydration. The widespread use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction techniques has led to an improvement in the diagnosis of this infection and an increased appreciation of the role of this virus in causing widespread epidemics of diarrhea on cruise ships [19] . The control of an outbreak is often very difficult and should involve aggressive infection control with active disinfection, isolation of sick individuals, and strict hand washing techniques with training of food handlers.",

These infections often tend to be more severe than those caused by Noroviruses, and have led to sporadic deaths in cruise ship passengers. The parasitic causes of diarrhea reported on cruise ships include Cyclospora species, which were implicated in a large outbreak on a cruise ship where the passengers may have acquired the infection from eating raspberries [27] . There have been sporadic outbreaks of diarrhea on ships caused by Cryptosporidium species and Trichenella spiralis [1, 28] . Most of these outbreaks involve a breakdown of the food and water sanitation chain. The factors implicated in various studies include use of contaminated food or water, inadequate food storage, cross-contamination of food, or infected food handlers [1] . The prevention of gastrointestinal infections on cruise ships involves controlling potential deficiencies in food and water handling as well as in cooking and catering, preventing sewage contamination of the water supply, and isolation of sick persons. In the absence of effective vaccines for the prevention of infections by most of the previously mentioned organisms, with the exception of S typhi, these efforts are the primary preventive methods to decrease the burden of gastrointestinal illnesses on cruise ships.",

This risk is caused by the age of the individual rather than their residence in the barracks. The use of paid sex workers and sexually transmitted diseases has historically flourished alongside military establishments from time immemorial, leading to sexually transmitted disease transmission between the barracks and surrounding communities. In the United States, the most commonly reported communicable infections in the military are sexually transmitted diseases, with Chlamydia infections being the highest followed by gonorrhea [55] . The military recruits tend to have higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases than the general population. In one study up to 10% of female recruits had Chlamydia infections [56] . The large disease burden caused by the sexually transmitted diseases and potential for complications from asymptomatic infections has led to recommendations of annual screening of all sexually active females less than 25 years old [57] .",
