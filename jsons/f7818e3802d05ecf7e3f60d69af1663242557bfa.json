We measured the time from admission to mobilization and other clinical characteristics for 190 heart failure patients (mean age, 80.7 years). The primary outcome was heart failure rehospitalization. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and the hazard ratios for rehospitalization were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. During a median follow-up period of 750 days, 58 patients underwent rehospitalization. The time from admission to mobilization was significantly longer for these patients than for those who were not rehospitalized. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that the time from admission to mobilization was an independent predictor of rehospitalization, and receiver-operating characteristic analysis determined an optimal cutoff value of 3 days for differentiating the patients more likely to experience a subsequent cardiac event (sensitivity, 76%; specificity, 69%; area under the curve, 0.667). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed a significantly lower event rate in the \u2264 3-day group (p = 0.001, log-rank test). In conclusion, the time from admission to mobilization may be one of the strongest predictors of rehospitalization in elderly heart failure patients. Early mobilization within 3 days may be an initial target for the acute phase treatment of heart failure.",

A small randomized trial in patients with acute stroke showed better physical functional status among those mobilized 24-48 h after hospitalization [4] . In addition, a report based on a large-scale clinical registry found an association between early rehabilitation and the clinical outcome in heart failure patients [5] .

However, little is known about the clinical impact of early mobilization on long-term clinical outcomes in elderly Japanese heart failure patients. We hypothesized that early mobilization would be associated with a lower rate of rehospitalization in elderly heart failure patients and that later mobilization may be a predictor of rehospitalization, in addition to other clinical parameters. Therefore, the aims of the present study were: (1) to investigate the relationship between early mobilization and long-term cardiac events in elderly Japanese heart failure patients and (2) to clarify the optimal cutoff time period for early mobilization associated with reduced rehospitalization.",

There was a significantly lower incidence of cardiac events in the group with earlier mobilization (log rank = 11.442, p = 0.001) within 3 days of admission were significantly less likely to be rehospitalized.

The results of the present study showed that the early mobilization of patients after admission to hospital had a predictive impact on rehospitalization during a followup period lasting a median of 750 days, after adjusting for several prognostic and confounding factors, including heart failure severity and physical function. A possible explanation for this finding may be that early mobilization reduced the risk of iatrogenic sarcopenia, a major hospital-acquired comorbidity caused by excessive bed rest in an acute phase clinical setting. Previous studies of Japanese heart disease patients have shown a close association between rehospitalization and physical function, as measured by 6-min walking distance [10] , gait speed [10, 11] , grip strength [12] , and functional capacity [13] . Elderly heart failure patients are more likely to experience sarcopenia, not only due to physical inactivity, but also because of their heart failure disease status [14] . Previous studies have reported that early mobilization had favorable effects on physical function at discharge [3] [4] [5] . However, in the present study, there was no difference in physical function between the rehospitalization and non-rehospitalization groups. A previous study of patients with heart failure reported that the prevention of functional decline during hospitalization was a positive prognostic factor [15] . Thus, the prevention of functional decline may be a factor related to our finding that early mobilization was associated with the reduced likelihood of long-term rehospitalization in elderly heart failure patients.",

The optimal cutoff value for differentiating between the rehospitalization and non-rehospitalization groups was 3 days, and the area under the curve was 0.667, indicating moderate ability to distinguish between the groups [16] . Furthermore, a Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a lower incidence of cardiac events for the subjects with early mobilization within 3 days of admission than for those with mobilization in 4 or more days. A previous multi-center observational study reported that elderly patients who developed sarcopenia spent an average of 5.1 days in bed compared with 3.2 days for those without sarcopenia at discharge [6] . A cutoff of 3 days could play an important role in preventing iatrogenic sarcopenia-related functional decline. Indeed, mobilization in 4 or more days had an 82% negative predictive value in the present study, suggesting that mobilization within 3 days from admission could be used to stratify patients at low risk of rehospitalization. Mobilization within 3 days and that this might be an initial target for the early mobilization for elderly patients with heart failure to improve the quality of acute phase heart failure treatment, similar to the door-to-balloon time within 90 min for coronary interventions [17] .",

First, it was based on a single-center registry of patients with heart failure and the results may not necessarily be generalized to groups with dissimilar demographic characteristics. Second, our patients had lower ACEi/ARB prescription about 50%. Previous large-scale registry reported that patients with older age and HFpEF were less likely to receive ACEi/ARB therapy [18, 19] . These were the reason why our patients had lower prescription of ACEi/ARB. However, rehospitalization rate in this study was almost the same rate as previous findings [19] , and there was no difference between two groups in terms pharmacotherapy. Accordingly, lower ACEi/ARB prescription rate did not influence our results. Finally, this was designed as a predictive research, so the level of evidence was lower than that provided by a propensity-score matching analysis or a randomized controlled trial. Thus, we could not determine the effectiveness of early mobilization within 3 days on rehospitalization. However, there are ethical issues to performing a randomized controlled trial in an acute phase clinical setting, and the results of the present study provided novel information that early mobilization could be a key component of acute phase treatment.",
