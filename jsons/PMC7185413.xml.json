Our experience with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in southern China in late 2002 and spread to over 30 countries in 8 months, indicates the importance of early detection (Banos and Lacasa, 2007). Disease surveillance is the principal tool used by the public health community to understand and manage the spread of diseases, and is defined by the World Health Organization as the ongoing systematic collection, collation, analysis and interpretation of data and dissemination of information in order for action to be taken (World Health Organization, 2007). Surveillance systems serve a variety of public health functions (e.g., outbreak detection, control planning) by integrating data representing human and/or animal health with statistical methods (Diggle, 2003), visualization tools (Moore et al., 2008), and increasingly, linkage with other geographic datasets within a GIS (Odiit et al., 2006).",

Outbreak detection is the intended function of many surveillance systems. In syndromic surveillance systems, early-warning signals are provided by analysis of pre-diagnostic data that may be indicative of people\u2019s care-seeking behaviour during the early stages of an outbreak. In contrast, systems designed to monitor food and water-borne (e.g., cholera) pathogens are designed for case detection, where one case may trigger a response from public health workers. Similarly, where eradication of a disease in an area is a public health objective, surveillance may be designed primarily for case detection. Alternatively, where a target disease is endemic to an area, perhaps with seasonal variation in incidence, such as rabies, monitoring space\u2013time trends may be the primary surveillance objective (Childs et al., 2000).",

Following the 2001 bioterrorism attacks in the United States, there was expanded interest and funding for the development of electronic surveillance networks capable of detecting a bioterrorist attack. Many of these were designed to monitor data that precede diagnoses of a disease (i.e., syndromic surveillance). By May 2003 there were an estimated 100 syndromic surveillance systems in development throughout the US (Buehler et al., 2003). Due to the noisy nature of syndromic data, these systems rely heavily on advanced statistical methods for anomaly detection. As data being monitored in syndromic systems precede diagnoses they contain a signal that is further removed from the pathogen than traditional disease surveillance, so in addition to having potential for early warning, there is also greater risk of false alarms (i.e., mistakenly signaling an outbreak) (Stoto et al., 2004).",

Data sources used in BioSense include Veterinary Affairs and Department of Defense facilities, private hospitals, national laboratories, and state surveillance and healthcare systems. The broad mandate and national scope of the system necessitated the use of general statistical methods insensitive to widely varying types, quality, consistency and volume of data. Two methods used in BioSense are a generalized linear mixed-model which estimates counts of syndrome cases based on location, day of the week and effects due to seasonal variation and holidays. Counts are estimated weekly for each syndrome-location combination. A second temporal surveillance approach computed for each syndrome under surveillance is a cumulative sum of counts where events are flagged as unusual if the observed count is two standard deviations above the moving average. The selection of surveillance methods in BioSense considered factors associated with heterogeneity of data sources and data volume among others.",

The selection of statistical approaches to surveillance for implementation as part of a national surveillance system is greatly impacted by design constraints due to scalability, data quality and data volume whereas the use of surveillance data for a standalone analysis by a local public health worker may be more impacted by software availability, learning curve, and interpretability.

A framework for evaluation developed by the CDC considers outbreak detection a function of timeliness, validity, and data quality (Buehler et al., 2004). The degree to which these factors contribute to system effectiveness may vary for different surveillance systems, especially where objectives and system experiences differ. For example, newly developed systems in developing countries may place a greater emphasis on evaluating data quality and representativeness, as little is known about the features of the data streams at early stages of implementation (Lescano et al., 2008). Algorithm performance is usually measured by sensitivity, specificity and timeliness. Sensitivity is the probability of an alarm given an outbreak, and specificity is the probability of no alarm when there is no outbreak. Timeliness is measured in number of time units to detection, and has been a focus of systems developed for early outbreak detection (Wagner et al., 2001). The importance of each of these measures of performance need to be evaluated in light of the system\u2019s contextual factors outlined in Table 1.",

The Knox test (1964) uses a simple test statistic which is the number of case pairs close both in space and in time. This count is compared to the null expectation conditional on the number of pairs close only in space, and the number of pairs close only in time; i.e., the times of occurrence of the cases are independent of case location. A major shortcoming of the Knox (1964) method is that the definition of \u201ccloseness\u201d is arbitrary. Mantel\u2019s (1967) test addresses this by summing across all possible space\u2013time pairs, while Diggle et al. (1995) identify clustering at discrete distance bands in the space\u2013time K function. For infectious diseases, it is likely that near space\u2013time pairs are of greater importance, so Mantel suggests a reciprocal transformation such that distant pairs are weighted less than near pairs. The Mantel test can in fact be used to test for association between any two distance matrices, and is often used by ecologists to test for interaction between space and another distance variable such as genetic similarity (Legendre and Fortin, 1989).",

In application to disease surveillance, the data are in the form of case counts for sub-regions of a larger study area. A running sum of deviations is recalculated at each time period. For a given sub-region, a count yt of cases at time t is monitored as follows(1)St=max(0,St-1+yt-k)where St is the cumulative sum alarm statistic, k is a parameter which represents the expected count, so that observed counts in exceedence of k are accumulated. At each time period, an alarm is signalled if St is greater than a threshold parameter h. If a CUSUM is run long enough, false alarms will occur as exceedences are incrementally accumulated. The false-positive rate is controlled by the expected time it takes for a false alarm to be signalled, termed the in-control average run length, denoted ARL0. The ARL0 is directly related to the threshold value for h, which can be difficult to specify in practice. High values of h yield long ARL0 and vice versa. In practice, approximations are used to estimate a value for h for a chosen ARL0 (Siegmund, 1985), though this remains a key issue in CUSUM methods.",

For a point pattern of cases of disease, compute the spatial statistic, and use this value of the statistic to condition the expected value at the next time period. Observed and expected values are used to derive a z-score which is then monitored as a CUSUM (Rogerson, 2005a). One scalar approach taken by Rogerson (2005b) is to monitor only the most unexpected value, or peak, of each time period as a Gumbel variate (Gumbel distribution is used as a statistical distribution for extreme values). An additional approach is to compute a univariate CUSUM in a parallel surveillance framework (Woodall and Ncube, 1985).

Multivariate CUSUM given by Rogerson and Yamada (2004) is for a singular disease over multiple sub-regions, but could be used to monitor multiple diseases over multiple sub-regions. This may be most applicable in a syndromic surveillance application. The simplicity of univariate CUSUM makes training and technical expertise less of a factor than the multivariate case.

The spatial approach looks for clusters by scanning over a map of cases of disease using circular search areas of varying radii. Kulldorff and Nagarwalla (1995) refined spatial scanning with the development of the spatial scan statistic which adjusts for the multiple testing of many circular search areas. The spatial scan statistic overcomes the multiple-testing problem (common to many local spatial analysis methods) by taking the most likely cluster defined by maximizing the likelihood that the cases within the search area are part of a cluster compared to the rest of the study area.

In long term space\u2013time surveillance scenarios, accurate population estimates between decennial censuses are rare or must be interpolated. In syndromic applications, where cases are affected by unknown variations in care-seeking behaviours, the raw population numbers may not accurately reflect the at-risk population. In Kulldorff et al.

Space\u2013time scan statistics are able to detect and locate clusters of disease, and can condition expected counts for individual sub-regions on population data or on previous case data, making these methods suitable for implementation where data volume is large. The scope of scan statistics, like most statistical tests, is limited to monitoring case data, either case event point data or counts by sub-region. Scan statistics are best served to detect and locate discrete localized outbreaks. Secondary clusters can be identified by ranking candidate clusters by their likelihood ratio. Yet region-wide outbreaks cannot be detected with scan-statistics because of the assumed form of a cluster as a compact geographical region where cases are greater than expected. Novel space\u2013time methods that search for raised incidence via graph-based connectivity may model spatial relationships of disease processes more accurately than circular search areas. However, the computational burden and complexity of these approaches limits their use to expert analysts and researchers. At the root of the problem is a conceptual discrepancy between the definition of a disease outbreak (which disease surveillance systems are often interested in detecting) and a disease cluster (defined by spatial proximity) which is common to all statistical testing methods for space\u2013time surveillance (Lawson, 2005).",

Particularly, relaxation of distributional assumptions, flexibility in link functions, and the ability to model spatial relationships (at multiple spatial scales) as random effects make GLMM useful for prospective space\u2013time disease surveillance. The scale and scope of the surveillance context does not limit a model-based approach, and models may be even more useful when data abnormalities such as time lags occur (as estimates can be based on covariates alone). One feature of GLMM that are important for many disease surveillance contexts are the ease with which spatial hierarchies can be incorporated. Ecological relationships that are structured hierarchically that impact disease emergence (e.g., climate, vegetation, vector life-cycle development) can be represented and accounted for. Further, human drivers of disease emergence (e.g., land-use policies, travel patterns, demographics) are often organized hierarchically through administrative units. In social sciences GLMMs are often used (i.e., multi-level models) that incorporate these \u2018contextual effects\u2019 on an outcome variable. A further advantage of GLMMs is their ability to incorporate spatial variation in the underlying population at risk by conditioning the expected value on the random effect component (bi in Eq. (3)). Where fewer people are present, the expected value is adjusted toward the mean. This can somewhat account for the small-numbers problem of SMRs in epidemiology, reducing the likelihood of estimating extremely low expected values in rural areas.",

However, this can also be a drawback, as a subjective element is introduced to the model. It is generally recommended that sensitivity analysis be conducted on a variety of candidate priors for model parameters (e.g., MacNab and Gustafson, 2007, MacNab, 2007a). These technical aspects of model-fitting require advanced statistical training. A further complexity of Bayesian models is estimation. MCMC methods are required for generating the posterior distributions for these types of models and are computationally very demanding (although see Rodeiro and Lawson, 2006b). This might negate the use of these approaches in surveillance contexts that require daily refitting of models (i.e., fine temporal resolution), however, monthly or annual model refitting may be possible.

However, there are also global model parameters which estimate the background variation in space and time estimated from historical data. Outbreaks are defined when variation in the residual space\u2013time process exceeds a threshold value c. Different values for the threshold parameter are evaluated and exceedence probabilities are mapped. Model parameters are fixed allowing the model to be run daily on new data. However, as noted in Diggle et al. (2005), this may fail to capture unknown temporal trends, and periodic refitting may be required.",

            "text": "A different approach is given by J\u00e4rpe (1999), which instead of decomposing the process into separate components, monitors a single parameter of spatial relationships in a surveillance setting. This is similar in spirit to Rogerson\u2019s work (Rogerson, 1997) monitoring point patterns with spatial statistics, though here a specific underlying process is assumed: the Ising model. The Ising model represents a binary-state two dimensional lattice (sites coded 0 or 1). There are two parameters for the Ising model; one governs the overall intensity (probability of a site being a 1), and another the spatial interaction (probability of nearby sites being alike). In J\u00e4rpe (1999), the intensity parameter is assumed equal and unchanging, and the surveillance is performed on the interaction parameter under different lattice sizes and types of change. The interaction parameter is essentially a global measure of spatial autocorrelation. This can then be monitored using temporal surveillance statistics such as CUSUM. Since the properties of the underlying model are known, J\u00e4rpe is able to detect very small changes in spatial autocorrelation which could indicate the shift of a disease from endemic to epidemic. While significant spatial autocorrelation is often present at both endemic and epidemic states, changes in clustering can reveal threshold dynamics of the process in a surveillance setting. This is a common feature of forest insect epidemics (Peltonen et al., 2002). Further, the effect of the lattice size can easily be estimated, and as lattice size is increased, sensitivity to changes in the interaction parameter increases as well.",

            "text": "While most methods discussed thus far have been developed with the analysis of aggregated counts of disease in mind, analysis of sites on a lattice may have applicability in certain disease surveillance contexts. For example, square lattices are used for remotely sensed image processing, and surveillance of the presence or absence of a disease in these sampling units using an Ising model-based approach could incorporate remotely sensed environmental covariates (e.g., normalized differential wetness index) as is commonly done for zoonotic disease risk mapping and forecasting (Kitron et al., 1996, Rogers et al., 1996, Wilson, 2002). However, it is unclear how covariates are included in the Ising model. This highlights an important point with model-based approaches to prospective surveillance: the main advantage of models is to incorporate extra information and to estimate smooth relative risks, yet as models grow in complexity they become more difficult to re-fit. This has implications for how suitable models are in different surveillance contexts. Where the temporal scale is large, expected counts can be based on observed data rather than using census or other data sources. This is particularly important where diseases follow seasonal trends. With limited temporal data available, estimating model parameters may make be impacted by regular variation in disease occurrence. For surveillance systems monitoring many small areas (i.e., large spatial scale), the Held et al. (2005) model would be of limited value as separate parameters need to be estimated for every sampling unit. Broad scale patterns over large areas might better captured by the point process approach of Diggle et al. (2005). Although here, case event data with fine spatial resolution is required.",

Surveillance models can be tailored to detect specific types of disease process changes, such as a region-wide increase, or small changes in spatial autocorrelation suggesting a shift from endemic to epidemic states. However, models also required additional tests to determine if incoming data differ from the expected (i.e., modelled) pattern of cases. Thus, in practice surveillance models are best utilized to estimate a realistic relative risk, and can then be combined with statistical tests such as CUSUM (J\u00e4rpe, 1999) and scan statistics (Kleinman et al., 2005).",

Goovaerts and Jacquez (2004) have used geostatistical approaches, estimating spatial dependence of background rates via the semivariogram, to develop more realistic null models for disease cluster detection.

Unusual clusters on the map imply heightened risk is associated with those locations. However, movement of animals and people decouples the location of diagnosis from disease risk by modifying exposure histories. Methods that account for mobility may be an important area for future surveillance, especially in the context of real-time, prospective outbreak detection. The relationship between case, location, and exposure is further complicated by disease latency periods, which gives rise to space\u2013time lags in diagnoses (Schaerstrom, 1999). This may be most important in the context of retrospective cluster analysis and investigation of possible environmental risk factors. Statistical tests have been developed to account for exposure history and mobility for case-control data (Jacquez and Meliker, 2009) and case-only data (Jacquez et al., 2007). Kernel-based approaches to risk estimation that incorporate duration at each location have been utilized for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Sabel et al., 2003). The general approach is to model and analyze the space\u2013time path of individuals in the sense of H\u00e4gerstrand (1967). As personal location data continues to become ubiquitous due to new technology such as GPS-enabled cell phones, surveillance methods that account for individual space\u2013time histories may see more application in public health surveillance.",

When space\u2013time surveillance is warranted, choice of which surveillance approach to use may be impacted by how spatial effects can be incorporated. Where spatial scale is small, one would likely focus on either process models or statistical tests which use an underlying distribution for the null hypothesis (i.e., Poisson model). The temporal scale of surveillance is also important. Large temporal scales can use either testing or modelling methods, and most suit methods where baselines are estimated from previous cases, such as with the space\u2013time permutation scan statistic. Short temporal scales are not appropriate for models when diseases have complex day of the week effects or seasonal variation in incidence. Scale will also affect the computational burden placed on the system. Many approaches reviewed here, particularly statistical tests such as scan statistics, use approximate randomization to generate a distribution of a test statistic under the null hypothesis.

In general, modelling approaches are better suited to monitoring space\u2013time trends. For what has been termed situational awareness, multiple signals are usually monitored. This is often the case in large syndromic applications such as BioSense and ESSENCE. These contexts are best suited to a modelling approach, as often heterogeneity needs to be modelled with covariates.",

Broadly speaking, greater statistical expertise is required for model-based methods than testing (understanding model assumptions, parameterizing models, preparing covariate data, and interpreting output), while testing concepts are generally easier to grasp. However, for epidemiologists already familiar with generalized linear mixed models, some model approaches that incorporated space and time may be quickly attainable, such as that of Kleinman et al. (2004). Yet for analysts from a health geography or spatial analysis background, testing methods might be more familiar. In any case, the use of space\u2013time surveillance methods in public health will only increase in the future, and it is important that training and education keep pace with the changing methods available for surveillance data analysis.",
