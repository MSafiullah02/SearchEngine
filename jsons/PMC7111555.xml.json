It is estimated that the internet contains over four and a half billion websites on the surface web, the deep web, which we know very little about, is at least four hundred times bigger than the surface web [3]. Soon afterwards in 1990, email platform emerged and then many applications. Then we saw a chain of web 2.0 technologies like E-commerce, which started, social media platforms, E-Business, E-Learning, E-government, Cloud Computing and more from 1995 to the early 21st century [4]. Now we have a large number of internet based technologies which have uncountable applications in many domains including business, science and engineering, and healthcare [5]. The impact of these technologies on our personal lives is such that we are compelled to adopt many of them whether we like it or not.",

In particular omics-research (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc.) is leading the charge to the growth of Big data [6, 7]. The challenges in omics-research are data cleaning, normalization, biomolecule identification, data dimensionality reduction, biological contextualization, statistical validation, data storage and handling, sharing and data archiving. Data analytics requirements include several tasks like those of data cleaning, normalization, biomolecule identification, data dimensionality reduction, biological contextualization, statistical validation, data storage and handling, sharing and data archiving. These tasks are required for the Big data in some of the omics datasets like genomics, tran-scriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, phenomics [6].",

As can be seen in Gartner hyper cycles in Figs. 2 and 3, Edge computing, as an emerging technology, has also peaked in 2017\u201318. As shown in the Cloud Computing architecture in Fig. 4, the middle or second layers of the cloud configuration are represented by the Fog computing. For some applications delay in communication between the computing devices in the field and data in a Cloud (often physically apart by thousands of miles), is detrimental of the time requirements, as it may cause considerable delay in time sensitive applications. For example, processing and storage for early warning of disasters (stampedes, Tsunami, etc.) must be in real time. For these kinds of applications, computing and storing resources should be placed closer to where computing is needed (application areas like digital street). In these kind of scenarios Fog computing is considered to be suitable [13]. Clouds are integral part of many IoT applications and play central role on ubiquitous computing systems in health related cases like the one depicted in Fig. 5. Some applications of Fog computing can be found in [14\u201316]. More results on Fog computing are also available in [17\u201319].",

In such a situation, Fog exposes its dependency to a complementary bottom layer of the cloud architectural organisation as shown in the Cloud architecture of Fig. 4. This bottom layer of hierarchical resources organization is known as the Dew layer. The purpose of the Dew layer is to cater for the tasks by exploiting resources near to the end-user with minimum internet access [17, 20]. As a feature, Dew computing takes care of determining as to when to use for its services linking with the different layers of the Cloud architecture. It is also important to note that the Dew computing [20] is associated with the distributed computing hierarchy and is integrated by the Fog computing services, which is also evident in Fig. 4. In summary, Cloud architecture has three layers, first being Cloud, second as Fog and the third Dew.",

Blockchain technology has made it possible to build a globally functional currency relying on code, without using any bank or third-party platforms [28]. These features have made the Blockchain technology, secure and transparent for business transactions of any kind involving any currencies. In literature, we find many applications of Blockchain. Nowadays, the applications of Blockchain technology involve various kinds of transactions requiring verification and automated system of payments using smart contracts. The concept of Smart Contacts [28] has virtually eliminated the role of intermediaries. This technology is most suitable for businesses requiring high reliability and honesty. Because of its security and transparency features, the technology would benefit businesses trying to attract customers. Blockchain can be used to eliminate the occurrence of fake permits as can be seen in [29].",

We learn the magnitude of these problem from examples of such as the target of the National Health Service (NHS) of the United Kingdom to digitize the UK healthcare is by 2023 [30].

Nosocomial infections are a common problem for hospitals and currently they are treated using various techniques [32, 33]. Historically, cleaning the hospital wards and operating rooms with chlorine has been an effective way. On the face of some deadly viruses like EBOLA, HIV Aids, Swine Influenza H1N1, H1N2, various strands of flu, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), there are dangerous implications of using this method [14]. An advanced approach is being used in the USA hospitals, which employs \u201crobots\u201d to purify the space as can be seen in [32, 33]. However, certain problems exist within the limitations of the current \u201crobots\u201d. Most of these devices require a human to place them in the infected areas. These devices cannot move effectively (they just revolve around themselves); hence, the UV light will not reach all areas but only a very limited area within the range of the UV light emitter. Finally, the robot itself maybe infected as the light does not reach most of the robot\u2019s surfaces. Therefore, there is an emerging need to build a robot that would not require the physical presence of humans to handle it, and could purify the entire room by covering all the room surfaces with UV light while, at the same time, will not be infected itself.",

The operator can control the robot via a networked graphical user interface and/or from an augmented reality environment which will utilize technologies such as the Oculus Touch. In more detail, the user will use the oculus rift virtual reality helmet and the oculus touch, as well as hand controllers to remote control the robot. This will provide the user with the vision of the robot in a natural manner. It will also allow the user to control the two front robotic arms of the spider robot via the oculus touch controller, making it easy to do conduct advance movements, simply by move the hands. The physical movements of the human hand will be captured by the sensors of oculus touch and transmitted to the robot. The robot will then use reverse kinematics to translate the actions and position of the human hand to movements of the robotic arm. This technique will also be used during the training phase of the robot, where the human user will teach the robot how to clean various surfaces and then purify itself, simply by moving their hands accordingly. The design of the spider robot was proposed in a project proposal submitted to the King Abdulaziz City of Science and Technology (https://www.kacst.edu.sa/eng/Pages/default.aspx) by the author and George Tsaramirsis (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/George_Tsaramirsis).",
