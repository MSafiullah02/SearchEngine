However, very little is known about the prevalence of infection among heart failure patients in COVID-19 endemic regions and the risk factors associated with clinical deterioration.",

Briefly, the Yale Heart Failure Registry is a live registry of patients seen within the integrated Yale New Haven Health System ( Figure   1 ) that meet the following evaluation logic: the patient has at least one encounter within the health system in the last 3 years and meets one of the four criteria (1) Problem List contains the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) concept heart failure, (2) Encounter Diagnosis contains SNOMED-CT concept heart failure for two or more face to face encounters within the last 12 months, (3) Encounter Diagnosis contains a SNOMED-CT concept heart failure for at least 1 admission within the last 12 months, (4) Coded Diagnosis is contained within one of the DRGs (291, 292, 293) for Heart Failure for at least 1 admission within the last 12 months. Of note, conditions in the Yale Electronic Health Record (EHR) use SNOMED-CT as the standard vocabulary for diagnosis codes. Registry exclusions are age<18, cardiac failure after obstetrical surgery or other procedure, or cardiac insufficiency during or resulting from a procedure. The registry has detailed information about demographics, comorbidities, laboratories, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), medications, geospatial mapping, and clinical outcomes (including hospital readmissions). Registry data is linked to the National Death Index, a centralized database of death record information on file in state vital statistics offices.

Physicians and other providers, however, can enter specific individual orders outside of COVID order sets as appropriate for individual patients but there is system wide guidance to standardize treatment (Supplementary Data). In brief, admitted patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are initiated on treatment if they were either hypoxic or had evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement (either by symptoms and/or chest radiography). Hydroxychloroquine is utilized for its antiviral properties. For patients who required mechanical ventilation, ECMO or had a combination of hypoxia with a hyperinflammatory state, tocilizumab is used for its antiinflammatory properties via IL-6 receptor inhibition.",

In their entirety, these data demonstrate the need for greater geographical based testing and interventions, particularly in vulnerable communities, and a greater focus on goals of care discussions among elderly heart failure patients who test positive. This is the first report describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in a geographically contained population of heart failure patients under the purview of an integrated health care system. We found that although testing was scattered across the state, those who tested positive tended to cluster around two cities-New Haven and Bridgeport, two of the cities with the lowest median household income in the state ($41,142 and $45,441 versus $76,106 for the state), and the highest percentage of black inhabitants (33.0% and 35.3%, versus 12% for the state). 6 This disparity in both testing, and infection rates has been recently noted, with preliminary data showing that underrepresented minorities are developing COVID-19 infection more frequently. 7 The causes for this finding are multifaceted and have been hypothesized to include the disproportionate number of minorities who are exposed to COVID-19 in their roles as All rights reserved.

Whereas these are cross-sectional observational data, they corroborate recent reports from China demonstrating a potential benefit of these therapies among COVID-19 + patients. 8 At the very least, this might suggest that these therapies do not increase risk in patients with heart failure and supports the AHA/ACC/HFSA statement supporting ongoing use of renin angiotensin blockade in heart failure patients during the pandemic. 9 Our study shows that a large portion of deaths occurred in elderly patients. High rates of mortality and morbidity have been described in older patients from Italy; however, less than 2% of their cohort was >80 years. 3 In our cohort, we noted 33% of COVID-19+ positive patients to be \u226585 years old. These patients had hospitalization rates of approximately 90%, 36% had died at the time of this analysis, and all the rest except one patient remained hospitalized.

This is currently the practice at most medical centers across the United States. As such our findings should be considered a conservative estimate of the expanse of COVID19 + HF patients in the communities covered by the registry. Second, despite laboratory testing and interventions currently being performed in a protocolized manner across the Yale New Haven Health Care System, some patients might have been hospitalized prior to widespread application of this care pathway. Third, many of the patients described in the study remain hospitalized, leading to likely underreporting of total deaths from COVID-19 + in our cohort. Finally, the study has limitations inherent in any registry, where a high degree of granularity about heart failure is missing and all testing is solely performed at the clinician's discretion.",
