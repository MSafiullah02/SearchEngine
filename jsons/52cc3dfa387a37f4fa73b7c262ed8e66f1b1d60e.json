However, during the initial phase of infection between 12 and 24 h post-inoculation (hpi), the viral antigens are detected only in the meninges, followed by viral spread into the ventricular wall before invasion into the brain parenchyma, indicating that the viruses employ a passage between the meninges and ventricular wall as an entry route into the brain parenchyma. At 48 hpi, the passage was found to be constructed by ER-TR7 antigen (ERag)-positive fibers (ERfibs) associated with laminin and collagen III between the fourth ventricle and meninges at the cerebellopontine angle. The construct of the fibers mimics the reticular fibers of the fibroblastic reticular network, which comprises a conduit system in the lymphoid organs. In the meninges, ERfibs together with collagen fibers, lining in a striped pattern, made up a pile of thin sheets. In the brain parenchyma, mature ERfibs associated with laminin were found around blood vessels. Besides mature ERfibs, immature Erfibs without associations with other extracellular matrix components like laminin and collagen appeared after infection, suggesting that the CNS creates a unique conduit system for immune communication triggered by viral invasion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Coronaviruses have relatively high mutation and RNA recombination rates and rapidly undergo cross-species transmission events in vitro and in vivo. [1] [2] [3] In humans, viruses newly emerging out of members of Coronaviridae cause serious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 4 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 5 Interest in the pathogenicity of murine coronaviruses, particularly, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), has grown because of the high incidences of mutation rates with consequences of different pathogeneses 6-10 as well as their ability, especially in JHM strains of MHV (JHMV), to cause both acute and chronic CNS diseases , 10, 11 because neuropathogenic viruses can induce significant neuronal dysfunction and degeneration of specific neuronal populations, sometimes leading to devastating, life-threatening consequences in infected humans. 12, 13 Among JHMVs, cl-2 exhibits extremely high neurovirulence. 10, 14, 15 A less virulent viral clone, srr7, has been isolated from cl-2, as a soluble receptor-resistant mutant. 16, 15 All mice infected with cl-2 die within 3 days post-inoculation (dpi), whereas mice infected with srr7 exhibit no clinical sign before 5 dpi and some of them survive after 10 dpi. However, there is no difference in the viral growth rate during the initial phase of infection between these two strains. 15, [17] [18] [19] The different virulence of these viruses is attributed to their capability to infect neurons, 15, 20 or their infectivity being independent or dependent upon a major MHV-receptor, carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 1. 21, 22 In agreement with their similar viral proliferation rates during the early phase of infection, the two viruses exhibit almost the same patterns of viral spread in the brain during the initial phase of infection. The viral antigens are first detected in the infiltrating cells, namely CD11b-positive (CD11b + ) cells of monocyte lineage, in the meninges at 12 h post-inoculation (hpi), and not at the site of the inoculation in the frontal lobe. 17, 19, 23 During 24 to 48 hpi, infected CD11b + cells appear in the ventricular cavity followed by infection of cell components of the ventricular wall, before viral spread into the brain parenchymal cells. 17, 18 The ventricular wall is also the target site during th einitial phase of infection with other species of viruses, including herpes simplex virus 24 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. 25 The manner of the viral spread after infection with cl-2 or srr7 indicated that there could be some other routes of viral entry into the brain parenchyma than crossing over the blood brain barrier (BBB), which has been almost exclusively studied or hypothesized as the mechanism of neuropathogenic viral entry into the brain parenchyma, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] including a pioneering study of poliovirus using genemanipulated mice introduced by the human-type polioviral receptor-gene. 31 However, the mechanism of viral distribution of a neurovirulent strain of polioviruses, the Mahoney strain, infecting motor neurons in the CNS, was not elucidated through studies of its ability to circumvent the BBB in comparison with that of an attenuated viral strain, Sabin strain. 32 Our investigation to identify the viral entry route focused on the area between the fourth ventricle (IVv) and meninges in the cerebellopontine angle, because viral antigens are often found in the area during the early phase of infection between 24 to 48 hpi, 17, 18 and there is a conduit, the foramen of Luschka, for CSF to flow from the ventricle into the subarachnoid space. Another intriguing feature of viral antigen localization after infection with cl-2 or srr7 is that the viral antigens were found in fibrous structures, which appeared to be the extracellular matrix (ECM), in the brain and spleen. 17, 18 Viruses proliferate and produce viral antigens in living cells, and it is unusual to find them in the ECM area through a light-microscopical observation. However, such colocalization of viral antigen or viral particles with the ECM has been reported to occur in the lymphoid organs. After infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), viral antigens are colocalized with the components of reticular fibers, including collagen III and laminin, in the spleen. 33 Similar phenomena have been reported in infection with extremely virulent viruses, such as Ebola, 34 Marburg and Lassa viruses. 35 These viruses infect fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) in the lymphoid organs, followed by immune dysfunction leading to viral persistence 33 or tissue destruction. 35 FRCs are considered to maintain reticular fibers, which compose fibroblastic reticular network (FRN) in the lymph nodes [36] [37] [38] and spleen. 39, 40 Erasmus University Rotterdam thymic reticulum antibody 7 (ER-TR7) has been used to define FRCs, 41, 42, 33 although the antigen of ER-TR7 has yet to be determined. Furthermore, there have been no reports on the size or determinant of the antigen using immune reactions, including Western blotting or immunoprecipitation. Each reticular fiber comprising the FRN is around 1 \u03bcm in diameter, and contains collagen fibers as a core surrounded by an ER-TR7 antigen-positive (ERag + ) microfibrillar layer, and is further enclosed with a basement lamina at the outer surface. The entire fiber is largely ensheathed by FRCs. 43 The FRN functions as a conduit system for immunocompetent cells and inflammation-associated molecules such as cytokines and ligands or foreign antigens to reach appropriate sites in order to cause immune reactions in the lymph nodes 44 and spleen, 39 or to guide homing of the cells. 42, 40 Subsequently, FRCs, which are podoplanin (gp38)-positive (Pod + ) and CD31-negative (CD31 \u00c0 ), have been reported to co-operate with other stromal cells in the lymph nodes, such as Pod + CD31 + lymphatic endothelial cells, Pod \u00c0 CD31 + blood endothelial cells, and Pod \u00c0 CD31 \u00c0 myofibroblastic pericytes, to play a key role in the FRN function, 45, 46 indicating that there should be organ-specific specialization of the fibroblastic stroma. In this report, we show the virus antigens detected in the brain as fibrous structures colocalized with ERag and laminin as the same images, as previously reported in the spleen infected with LCMV. 33 This finding encouraged us to prove the expression of ERag along the reticular system in the brain, which could function as a scaffold for viral entry and inflammatory cell invasion into the brain.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 151, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 152, "end": 155, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 156, "end": 159, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 299, "end": 300, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 346, "end": 347, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 668, "end": 671, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 672, "end": 674, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 886, "end": 889, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 890, "end": 892, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 951, "end": 954, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 955, "end": 958, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 959, "end": 961, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1069, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1072, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1377, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1382, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1387, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1392, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1490, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1493, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1619, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1622, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2071, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2072, "end": 2075, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2076, "end": 2078, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2276, "end": 2279, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2280, "end": 2282, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2430, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2471, "end": 2473, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2811, "end": 2815, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2816, "end": 2820, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2821, "end": 2825, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2826, "end": 2830, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2831, "end": 2835, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2961, "end": 2963, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3249, "end": 3251, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3512, "end": 3515, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3516, "end": 3518, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3861, "end": 3864, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3865, "end": 3867, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4338, "end": 4340, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 4439, "end": 4441, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 4469, "end": 4471, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4639, "end": 4641, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4762, "end": 4766, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4767, "end": 4771, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4772, "end": 4776, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 4789, "end": 4792, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 4793, "end": 4795, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 4892, "end": 4895, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 4896, "end": 4899, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 4900, "end": 4902, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 5414, "end": 5416, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 5650, "end": 5652, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 5665, "end": 5667, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 5701, "end": 5704, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 5705, "end": 5707, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 6053, "end": 6056, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 6057, "end": 6059, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 6348, "end": 6350, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The highly neurotropic MHV strain MHV-JHM cl-2 (cl-2) 14 was used.

The dextran particles were appropriately introduced into the recipients, because a high level of the particles was seen in the spleen of mice with no treatment along with Erfbs, especially in the marginal zone around the follicle (Fig. 3D) , and partially in the follicle (insert in Fig. 3D ), as previously reported. 39 The viral antigens were detected in the ventricle of cl-2-infected mice in a similar way as dextran particles. In the deeper area of the ventricle at the positions corresponding to b and c in Figure 3E , viral antigen-positive cells closely associated with ERfibs were observed ( Fig. 3G and H, respectively) . However, in the area near the junction between the meninges and ventricle at position a in Figure 3E , the viral antigens did not always distribute along with ERfibs (Fig. 3F) , possibly because viruses brought into the ventricle earlier than in the deeper area had time to induce the antigens in the infiltrated and domestic cells after infection. Because viral antigens are already detectable in cells of the monocyte lineage (MoCs) that have infiltrated the meninges during the initial phase of infection at 12 hpi, 17 CD11b-positive (CD11b + ) cells as a carrier to transport viruses into the ventricle were examined. Double staining for CD11b and ERag revealed a close association of MoCs and ERfibs in the ventricle (Fig. 3I) .

One of the reasons that such an important role of ERfibs to operate a conduit system in other organs was not described could be that the authors might have been obliged to limit the character of ERag + structures, because an increase of these structures in injured regions, which were examined at around 1 week or more after the treatment of the mice, might not be large enough to trace and prove that they function as a conduit system. For example, ERag + structures in the meninges have been reported to be found only in the sulcus 52 where the arachnoid membrane does not exist. In contrast, our results showed high expression of ERag + structures in the arachnoid membrane. The reason why we could trace the ERfibs could be that the virus cl-2 is an extremely neurovirulent strain, leading infected mice to a morbid state in 48 hpi. 8, 9, 14 The more vigorous the insult is, the more extended the host reaction would be. Actually, the increased thickness of the arachnoid membrane formed during concentrated time periods after the infection enabled us to observe the architecture of a striped pattern consisting of ERfibs and collagen fibers, forming the sheet of a thin membrane. Each of the sheets was approximately 0.7-1.0 \u03bcm thick, which corresponds to the diameter of each reticular fiber serving as a unit of the conduit system in the lymphoid organs, 43, 45 and the sheets had been considered to be meningeal fibers on the two-dimensional observation of thin sections. Furthermore, between the sheets, many cells were detected, many of which should be infected CD11b + cells. 17, 18 A classic neuropathological understanding of the sites of infiltrating cells observed in meningitis has theoretically assumed a subarachnoid space between the arachnoid membrane and pia mater. The ERfib-embedded sheets may guide inflammatory cells after extravasation to migrate into the meningeal region, but on the other hand, the sheets might restrict the inflammatory lesion in the meninx blocking the direct spread of inflammatory cells and viral particles from the meninx into the brain parenchyma. At least at 48 hpi, the prevention of direct invasion of the inflammatory cells and viruses from the meninx to the brain parenchyma seemed to be successful, as has also been observed in meningitis induced by other infectious agents. [55] [56] [57] Before our findings, such prevention was thought to be operated by the pia mater and astrocytes comprising glia limitans at the brain surface, 58 because inflammatory cells and infectious agents have been considered to be able to freely move around the presumed subarachnoid space.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 221, "end": 223, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 360, "end": 362, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1303, "end": 1305, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1583, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1587, "text": "44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1590, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1661, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1664, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1688, "end": 1690, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1803, "text": "49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1806, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1849, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2002, "text": "49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2003, "end": 2005, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2637, "end": 2639, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2940, "end": 2942, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2943, "end": 2945, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2946, "end": 2948, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3465, "end": 3468, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3469, "end": 3471, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3690, "end": 3693, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3694, "end": 3696, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4435, "end": 4439, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 4440, "end": 4444, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 4445, "end": 4449, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 536, "end": 558, "text": "Fig. 2A, respectively)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The increase in ERfibs after infection had already occurred at 12 hpi.

In contrast, in cl-2infected mice, labeled dextran particles were found in the ventricle showing a close association with Erfibs. This and subsequent findings indicated that ERfibs need to be allied with some other substances including ECM components detected in FRN to function as a scaffold. The ERfibs in the ventricle of infected mice were co-localized with laminin at a higher level compared with those of sham-infected mice. In addition, ERfibs that appeared at 12 hpi were not colocalized with laminin, although in the area of peripheral nerves there were high levels of pre-existing laminin as a component of the basement membrane around Schwann cells. Another immature form of ERfibs appeared after the three-dimensional construction of images. In the fourth ventricle, an ERag + net-like structure was found hanging on two pole-like structures of laminin, without forming firm fibers. The findings were supported by a study using a primary brain mix culture, where several stages of ERag + expression with various types of association with ECM were observed (data not shown).
