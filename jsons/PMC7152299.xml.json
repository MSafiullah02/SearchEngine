It is one of the most important ocular diseases in cats.2.\nDescribe the structure of the uvea.\nThe uvea constitutes the vascular portion of the eye and consists of three main components:1.The iris forms the most anterior portion and is the boundary between anterior and posterior chambers. Inflammation of the iris is termed iritis.2.The ciliary body is the middle portion of the uvea that is responsible for formation of aqueous humor and accommodation. Inflammation of the ciliary body is termed cyclitis. Together the iris and ciliary body are considered the anterior uvea.3.The choroid, located between the sclera and retina, supplies oxygen and nutrients to the outer layer of the retina and the optic nerve. It is considered the posterior uvea. Inflammation of the choroid is termed choroiditis. Inflammation of the choroid typically also affects the retina, in which case it is termed chorioretinitis.\n3.\nDefine endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis.\nInflammation of the entire uveal tract is termed endophthalmitis. When endophthalmitis is coupled with scleral and corneal inflammatory changes, it is termed panophthalmitis.4.\nHow is uveitis classified?\n\u2022Location (anterior, posterior)\u2022Duration (acute, chronic, recurrent)\u2022Pathology (e.g., granulomatous, suppurative)\u2022Cause (trauma, infection, neoplasia, immune-mediated)\n5.\nWhat determines the clinical manifestations of uveitis?\nThe clinical appearance of uveitis depends on location, duration, and severity. Clinical signs of uveitis in cats are generally subtle and divided into those that affect either the anterior (iris and ciliary body) or posterior (choroid) segment.6.Describe the clinical signs of anterior uveitis.1.Photophobia, blepharospasm, enophthalmos, elevation of the third eyelid, and epiphora manifest as ocular pain. Pain is common with acute uveitis but may be absent with mild or chronic cases.2.Injection of conjunctival and episcleral vessels results in a \u201cred eye.\u201d3.Low intraocular pressure (IOP) occurs when aqueous humor formation is impaired by inflammation of the ciliary body. A difference > 5 mmHg between eyes is considered significant. If uveitis is complicated by secondary glaucoma, IOP can be elevated or in the normal range if the decrease in IOP caused by uveitis is counterbalanced by the impairment of aqueous humor outflow associated with secondary glaucoma.3.Aqueous flare is cloudy aqueous humor that results from influx of cells and protein when the blood-ocular barrier is disrupted as a result of uveal inflammation.4.Corneal edema can result from effects of inflammation on the corneal endothelium and ranges from perilimbal to generalized.5.Keratic precipitates are inflammatory cells in the aqueous humor that are deposited on the corneal endothelium. Normal convection currents of the aqueous humor cause the precipitates to be located primarily on the ventral half of the cornea.6.\nMiosis results from direct effects on the iris sphincter of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins. Its absence does not rule out uveitis because mild miosis is difficult to detect.7.Iritis is manifested by vasodilatation and increased vessel permeability that can produce a subtle-to-pronounced change in iris color. The iris may appear swollen and have a thin coat of fibrin and cells, giving it a velvety appearance. Rubeosis iridis is the proliferation of small vessels on the iris surface.8.Hyphema.9.Hypopyon.\n7.What clinical signs indicate chronic or previous inflammation in the anterior segment?1.Posterior synechia are adhesions to the anterior lens capsule that may cause the pupil to be irregularly shaped and impair its ability to respond to light or dilating agents.2.Iris bomb\u00e9 forms when posterior synechia involve the entire pupil margin and prevent aqueous humor from moving from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber and exiting through the filtration angle. The accumulation of aqueous humor behind the iris causes it to billow forward and is associated with increasing IOP and glaucoma.3.Peripheral anterior synechia are adhesions of the peripheral iris to the corneal endothelium secondary to iris swelling or iris bomb\u00e9.4.Glaucoma.\n8.\nDescribe the clinical manifestations of posterior uveitis.\nClinical signs of posterior uveitis are often difficult to observe. Focal or diffuse hyporeflectivity of the retina indicates active fluid accumulation. This inflammatory subretinal transudation or exudation may result in retinal hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Chronic inflammation may result in loss of the normal tapetal color and loss of retinal pigment epithelial cells and choroidal pigmentation. Posterior uveitis almost always extends to involve the retina. Chronic chorioretinitis results in degeneration of the involved retina. Inactive chorioretinitis lesions appear hyperreflective.9.\nWhat are the differential diagnoses of uveitis in cats?\nCauses of uveitis in cats can be endogenous or exogenous and are listed in the tables below. In contrast to dogs, systemic infectious disease is more commonly found to be the cause of uveitis in cats. Appropriate treatment of uveitis, therefore, requires proper diagnosis, because the uveitis may be the first indication of a serious or life-threatening illness. Clinical or serologic evidence of systemic disease is detected in 25\u201390% of cats with uveitis.\n\n10.\nHow do you determine the cause of uveitis in cats?\nA good history, physical examination, and a minimal database of complete blood chemistry, serum biochemical profile, and urinalysis are essential. Thoracic and abdominal radiographs as well as abdominal ultrasonography may be indicated if a neoplastic or infectious process is suspected. Outdoor cats should be routinely tested for Toxoplasma gondii, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Cats raised in a cattery or < 2 years of age should be routinely screened for coronaviruses. Ocular fluids can be used for cytology, culture and sensitivity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and determination of antibody content.11.What are the four most common causes of systemic endogenous uveitis in cats?1.\nT. gondii\n2.Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)3.FIV4.Lymphoma with or without serologic evidence of FeLV\n12.What are the ocular signs of T. gondii infection?Ocular toxoplasmosis can result in anterior or posterior uveitis and may be unilateral or bilateral.13.\nDo all field strains of T. gondii induce ophthalmic disease?\nThe disease-inducing potential of T. gondii probably varies, because relatively few of the many seropositive cats have ophthalmic disease. The actual prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in naturally exposed cats is unknown because it is difficult to confirm the diagnosis. Recent work suggests that ocular toxoplasmosis may occur in kittens infected transplacentally or in the postnatal period.14.\nHow do you diagnose ocular toxoplasmosis?\nSerologic evaluation for T. gondii infection should include assays that detect IgG and IgM. T. gondii-specific IgM is detected for days to weeks in subclinically infected cats but may be of high magnitude in cats with clinical toxoplasmosis. Serum IgG antibodies develop approximately 2 weeks after infection and remain elevated in cats for years after exposure. A 4-fold increase in IgG titer over 2\u20133 weeks or an IgM titer > 1:256 indicates recent or active infection. Cats with ocular toxoplasmosis may be seropositive for IgM and seronegative for IgG, particularly if they are FIV-seropositive. Detection of local antibody production or T. gondii DNA in aqueous humor may aid in the diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis (Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO).15.\nWhat are the ocular signs of FIP?\nBilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis may be present. Clinical findings range from iritis, large keratic precipitates, clots of fibrin and blood in the anterior chamber, pyogranulomatous cuffing of the retinal vasculature, and chorioretinitis to retinal hemorrhage and retinal detachment.16.\nAre ocular lesions most often seen with the effusive or noneffusive form of FIP?\nOcular lesions are most often seen with the noneffusive, or dry form of FIP.17.\nHow do you diagnose FIP?\nDiagnosis of FIP-associated ocular disease is difficult because of the nonspecific nature of available coronavirus serum antibody tests. Positive coronavirus serum antibodies document only exposure to coronavirus and do not correlate with FIP. In addition, results of blood reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) do not correlate with FIP. Characteristic ocular lesions in the presence of rising serum antibody titers suggest the diagnosis particularly, if the appropriate signalment and history are also present (see Chapter 38). If effusions are present, characteristic findings aid in the diagnosis of FIP (see Chapter 38).18.\nWhat are the ocular signs of FIV?\nAnterior uveitis and pars planitis are the most common ocular findings in cats with FIV. The uveitis is typically chronic and mild. A higher incidence of glaucoma has been associated with or without uveitis in FIV-positive cats.19.\nIn what two ways can FIV produce uveitis?\n\nDirectly: through the local production of FIV antibodies and antigens.\nIndirectly: immunodeficiency associated with FIV can result in opportunistic infections such as T. gondii and C. neoformans.20.\nHow is ocular disease due to FIV diagnosed?\nIt is difficult to prove that ocular inflammation is due to FIV. Presence of serum antibodies against FIV usually correlates with current infection but cannot be used to prove illness due to infection. Currently, the only way to document FIV-associated uveitis is to exclude all other known causes in a seropositive cat.21.\nCan feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) cause intraocular disease?\nFHV-1 DNA and local FHV-1 antibody production were detected in the aqueous humor of cats with suspected idiopathic uveitis. These results show that FHV-1 can enter the eyes of cats and, in addition to keratoconjunctivitis, may be associated with uveitis. Serum antibody detection is of no benefit in the diagnosis of FHV-1 uveitis because most cats are vaccinated or previously exposed to FHV-1. Aqueous humor can be tested for FHV-1 by PCR commercially (Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO).22.Is Bartonella henselae associated with uveitis in cats?Cats are the apparent reservoir host for B. henselae. Although clinical disease is rare, 55-81% of cats are seropositive. B. henselae is one of the causes of cat-scratch disease in humans, and uveal tract inflammation has been reported in association with infection. Bartonella spp. was suggested as a likely cause of anterior uveitis in one cat based on the presence of antibody production in aqueous humor and response to doxycycline. Bartonella spp., therefore, may be able to invade the eyes of cats and result in uveitis.23.\nHow does FeLV cause ocular disease?\nFeLV has not been shown to cause primary ocular disease. Ocular disease associated with FeLV is manifested in two ways:\u2022Metastatic lymphosarcoma of the anterior uvea and neurologic tissue\u2022Opportunistic infections secondary to immunosuppression\n24.\nHow is FeLV-associated ocular disease diagnosed?\nThe clinical presentation of neoplastic infiltration of the uveal tract and resultant uveitis may vary widely. Nodular or diffuse infiltration of the posterior or anterior uveal tract is possible. Although isolated ocular lymphosarcoma is rare, many cats present primarily for ocular signs. A search for neoplastic involvement of other organs should be made. Cats with lymphosarcoma should be staged (I\u2013V) and FeLV status should be determined because both are related to treatment response and prognosis (see Chapter 68). Ocular involvement is by definition stage V lymphosarcoma. Aqueous humor cytology may be diagnostic in cases in which obvious lymphosarcoma cannot be identified in other organs. Testing for FeLV is always indicated in cats with uveitis whether or not lymphosarcoma is suspected, because opportunistic infection may be present. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of the p27 antigen in the blood (serum) is a useful screening tool for FeLV, but a positive immunofluorescent assay (IFA) correlates better with persistent viremia (see Chapter 76). A positive FeLV test does not prove ocular disease due to the virus, nor does a negative test rule out lymphosarcoma. Most FeLV-positive cats do not have lymphosarcoma, and 20\u201370% of cats with confirmed lymphosarcoma are FeLV-negative.25.\nWhat is idiopathic uveitis? How is it diagnosed?\nIdiopathic uveitis is any uveitis in which a cause cannot be identified. Unfortunately, a cause is not identified in 10\u201370% of cats with uveitis. The lymphocytic-plasmocytic infiltration of the anterior uvea found on histopathology in eyes lacking an etiologic diagnosis suggests that it may be immune-mediated. Whether this immune-mediated reaction is a true autoimmune disease or triggered by other antigenic stimulation remains to be determined in cats.26.\nWhat are the goals of treating uveitis in cats?\n\nNonspecific\n1.Stop or decrease the inflammation.2.Prevent or control the complications caused by inflammation.3.\nRelieve pain\n\n\nSpecific\n1.Address etiologic agents (e.g., virus, bacteria, fungi).2.Address specific causes of inflammation (e.g., foreign body, corneal ulcer, luxated lens).\n27.\nHow should you treat uveitis in cats?\nSpecific therapies for treating infectious agents are addressed in other chapters. In general, clindamycin hydrochloride is used for toxoplasmosis (see Chapter 11), doxycycline is used for B. henselae (see Chapter 85) and feline ehrlichiosis (see Chapter 78), and itraconazole or fluconazole is used for C. neoformans (see Chapter 4). Nonspecific therapies are listed in the table below.\n\n28.\nWhat is the main difference in treatment of anterior and posterior uveitis?\n\nSystemic therapy is the treatment of choice for posterior uveitis. Systemic glucocorticoid administration must be used with caution if an infectious process is suspected.\nTopical therapy is the treatment of choice for anterior uveitis. If inflammation is not well controlled, addition of subconjunctival or systemic medication may be necessary.29.\nFor what two reasons are topical and subconjunctival glucocorticoids contraindicated in the treatment of uveitis in the presence of corneal ulceration?\n1.Inhibition of wound healing2.Augmentation of collagenase activity in the cornea\n30.\nWhen should you use subconjunctival glucocorticoids?\nThis form of treatment should be used only in cases of severe intraocular inflammation as an adjunct to topical or systemic steroids or in cases in which frequent topical therapy is not possible. A serious disadvantage to this method is inability to withdraw the medication if complications arise.31.\nWhen should topical and systemic NSAIDs be used in cats?\nThere is little information about their use in cats. NSAIDs should be considered only when glucocorticoids are contraindicated. Topical NSAIDs may complicate bacterial corneal infections and are not recommended. Systemic NSAIDs should be used with caution in cats because they have been associated with potentially severe side effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhage, and bone marrow suppression.32.\nHow do you relieve the ocular pain associated with uveitis?\nMydriatics/cycloplegics relieve pain by relaxation of ciliary body and iris spasm. The duration and frequency of use depend on the severity of the inflammation.33.\nWhat are the potential sight-threatening complications of failure to control intraocular inflammation?\n\u2022Posterior synechiae\u2022Glaucoma\u2022Cataracts\u2022Lens luxation\u2022Retinal degeneration\u2022Retinal detachment\n\n",
