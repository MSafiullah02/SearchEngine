The revolution began late in 20th century with the arrival of internet in 1995, which has given rise to methods, tools and gadgets having astonishing applications in all academic disciplines and business sectors. In this article we shall provide a design of a 'spider robot' which may be used for efficient cleaning of deadly viruses. In addition, we shall examine some of the emerging technologies which are causing remarkable breakthroughs and improvements which were inconceivable earlier. In particular we shall look at the technologies and tools associated with the Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Sensor Networks and Social Media. We shall analyse capabilities and business value of these technologies and tools. As we recognise, most technologies, after completing their commercial journey, are utilised by the business world in physical as well as in the virtual marketing environments. We shall also look at the social impact of some of these technologies and tools.",

It is estimated that the internet contains over four and a half billion websites on the surface web, the deep web, which we know very little about, is at least four hundred times bigger than the surface web [3] . Soon afterwards in 1990, email platform emerged and then many applications. Then we saw a chain of web 2.0 technologies like E-commerce, which started, social media platforms, E-Business, E-Learning, E-government, Cloud Computing and more from 1995 to the early 21st century [4] . Now we have a large number of internet based technologies which have uncountable applications in many domains including business, science and engineering, and healthcare [5] . The impact of these technologies on our personal lives is such that we are compelled to adopt many of them whether we like it or not.",

As a feature, Dew computing takes care of determining as to when to use for its services linking with the different layers of the Cloud architecture.

With growing number of internet based applications, which use many technologies, devices and tools, one would think, the name of IoT seems to have evolved. Accordingly, things (technologies, devices and tools) used together in internet based applications to generate data to provide assistance and services to the users from anywhere, at any time. The internet can be considered as a uniform technology from any location as it provides the same service of 'connectivity'. The speed and security however are not uniform. The IoT as an emerging technology has peaked during 2017-18 as is evident from Figs. 2 and 3. This technology is expanding at a very fast rate. According to [21] [22] [23] [24] , the number of IoT devices could be in millions by the year 2021.",

But the Blockchain technology can also be used for many more critical applications of our daily lives. The Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology in the form of a distributed transactional database, secured by cryptography, and governed by a consensus mechanism. A Blockchain is essentially a record of digital events [26] . A block represents a completed transaction or ledger. Subsequent and prior blocks are chained together, displaying the status of the most recent transaction. The role of chain is to provide linkage between records in a chronological order. This chain continues to grow as and when further transactions take place, which are recorded by adding new blocks to the chain. User security and ledger consistency in the Blockchain is provided by Asymmetric cryptography and distributed consensus algorithms. Once a block is created, it cannot be altered or removed. The technology eliminates the need for having a bank statement for verification of the availability of funds or that of a lawyer for certifying the occurrence of an event. The benefits of Blockchain technology are inherited in its characteristics of decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability [27, 28] .",

Medical field is still undergoing to manage their data efficiently in a digital form. As usual the issues of disparate and nonuniform record storage methods are hampering the digitization, data warehouse and big data analytics, which would allow efficient management and sharing of the data. We learn the magnitude of these problem from examples of such as the target of the National Health Service (NHS) of the United Kingdom to digitize the UK healthcare is by 2023 [30] . These problems lead to inaccuracies of data which can cause many issues in healthcare management, including clinical and administrative errors. Use of Blockchain in healthcare can bring revolutionary improvements. For example, smart contracts can be used to make it easier for doctors to access patients' data from other organisations. The current consent process often involves bureaucratic processes and is far from being simplified or standardised. This adds to many problems to patients and specialists treating them. The cost associated with the transfer of medical records between different locations can be significant, which can virtually be reduced to zero by using Blockchain. More information on the use of Blockchain in the healthcare data can be found in [30, 31] .",

Nosocomial infections are a common problem for hospitals and currently they are treated using various techniques [32, 33] . Historically, cleaning the hospital wards and operating rooms with chlorine has been an effective way. On the face of some deadly viruses like EBOLA, HIV Aids, Swine Influenza H1N1, H1N2, various strands of flu, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), there are dangerous implications of using this method [14] . An advanced approach is being used in the USA hospitals, which employs ''robots'' to purify the space as can be seen in [32, 33] . However, certain problems exist within the limitations of the current ''robots''. Most of these devices require a human to place them in the infected areas. These devices cannot move effectively (they just revolve around themselves); hence, the UV light will not reach all areas but only a very limited area within the range of the UV light emitter. Finally, the robot itself maybe infected as the light does not reach most of the robot's surfaces. Therefore, there is an emerging need to build a robot that would not require the physical presence of humans to handle it, and could purify the entire room by covering all the room surfaces with UV light while, at the same time, will not be infected itself. Figure 7 is an overview of the design of a fully motorized spider robot with six legs. This robot supports Wi-Fi connectivity for the purpose of control and be able to move around the room and clean the entire area. The spider design will allow the robot to move in any surface, including climbing steps but most importantly the robot will use its legs to move the UV light emitter as well as clear its body before leaving the room. This substantially reduces the risk of the robot transmitting any infections.",

In more detail, the user will use the oculus rift virtual reality helmet and the oculus touch, as well as hand controllers to remote control the robot. This will provide the user with the vision of the robot in a natural manner. It will also allow the user to control the two front robotic arms of the spider robot via the oculus touch controller, making it easy to do conduct advance movements, simply by move the hands. The physical movements of the human hand will be captured by the sensors of oculus touch and transmitted to the robot. The robot will then use reverse kinematics to translate the actions and position of the human hand to movements of the robotic arm.
