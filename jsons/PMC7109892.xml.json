The primer 3\u2032 ends avoided the third codon position. Wobble positions in primers were avoided to guarantee reliable resynthesis of primers. When necessary, virus sequence heterogeneity was compensated for by mixing of defined oligonucleotides. The stable non-Watson-Crick base pairing T:G was not strictly adjusted for.",

Seven new sequences for the target region were generated (GenBank accession no. EF490228, SEBOV Gulu 10/200; EF490229, ZEBOV Gabon 1995; EF490230, ZEBOV Gabon 2003; EF490231, ZEBOV Gabon 2001; EF490232, MARV Ravn; EF490233, CIEBOV) and used for assay design, together with the 8 sequences available at that time. Initially, attempts were made to keep the published Filo-A/Filo-B primer positions. However, Filo-A was not very appropriate for REBOV and CIEBOV. It was shifted downstream (positive mRNA sense), and a mix of 3 primers was used at a more appropriate binding site. This was also beneficial for obtaining a short amplification fragment, as required in probe-based real-time RT-PCR. Primer Filo-B could be kept, but it was supplemented by an additional oligonucleotide that was more specific for MARV. Three detection probes were formulated separately for ZEBOV/REBOV, SEBOV/CIEBOV, and MARV, as shown in figure 1A. With inosine-containing probes, it was possible to compensate for as many as 4 nucleotide mismatches, as maximally observed in EBOV, without losing signal intensity (figure 1B and 1C). For MARV, such an adaptation was not necessary. There was no need to change the assay design in view of more recently published filovirus sequences [10]. Figure 1A provides a summary of sequence diversity observed at all oligonucleotide binding sites, as updated in October 2006. Sequences from the 2005 outbreak of MARV infection in Uige, Angola, were not yet published when oligonucleotides were designed for this study, but compatibility with these sequences was confirmed to us before publication [11].",

A proprietary noncompetitive internal control RNA was included instead of the competitive internal control used in the in-house version. Sensitivity was evaluated on plaque-quantified virus stock material, as shown in figure 2, as well as on sample panels froma recent proficiency testing study [3]. All filovirus samples from this study were correctly detected, and all RNA quantification results showed <1 log10 deviation from predetermined data [3]. Clinical specimens were available from 2 patients: 1 serum sample from an outbreak of SEBOV infection in Uganda and 1 buccal swab from an outbreak of ZEBOV infection in Gabon. Testing of both materials by RT-PCR has been described elsewhere [1, 5]. Both were readily detected with the assay.",

The feasibility of developing such kits through close collaboration with industry has been demonstrated in connection with the SARS outbreak in 2003, when a test kit was made available during the epidemic. The main purpose of the present study was to design a similar kit for filoviruses. Most of the preliminary work was done by academic and governmental institutions, lowering the financial entry threshold for a company that collaborated as a network partner. Kits could be produced in accordance with high quality standards, with features comparable to those of commercial diagnostic PCR systems (e.g., HIV- 1, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus). This is the first probe-based assay compatible with all known filovirus species. An internal control monitors the sensitivity in every single reaction. Analytical properties have been evaluated in accordance with industry-approved standards, such as probit analysis with a broad range of filovirus strains, intra- and inter-assay variability analysis, and specificity testing with an exhaustive panel of viruses causing related clinical manifestations. These data not only will ensure wide acceptance of the assay as a standard test in Europe but could also serve as an entry point into production as an in vitro diagnostic procedure.",

The diagnostics of filovirus infection should always be based on the whole range of diagnostic tests, including PCR, antigen testing, antibody detection, and virus culture. Moreover, new technical developments and novel virus strains impose continued work on molecular assays. The present study has shown that such work is possible only through collaboration and exchange of virus material.

Note that only representative sequences are shown. All sequences occurring more than once at each of the oligonucleotide binding sites have been deleted from the alignment. The alignment was updated in October 2006 with latest GenBank entries. The complete alignment can be retrieved from http://www.bni-hamburg.de/ebovalign. B, A probe matching ZEBOV (top panel), modified to adapt a single nucleotide mismatch as present in REBOV (probe EBOg, lower panel). No loss of signal occurred for ZEBOV (bottom panel), and the signal for REBOV improved (not shown; REBOV was not yet available at the time these experiments were performed). C, top panel, A probe containing 2 inosin residues at positions of variability but otherwise matching SEBOV (probe EBOSu), yielding a good detection signal (similar to the signal from a corresponding RNA concentration of ZEBOV; compare with panel B). C, middle panel, A probe of similar design, adapted to CIEBOV, yielding good signal for CIEBOV. However, because CIEBOV was also detectable with good efficiency with the EBOSu probe (C, bottom panel), EBOSu was used for both SEBOV and CIEBOV. D, Detection signals with oligonucleotides, as shown in panel A, in reactions containing low concentrations of virus RNA (flat lines denote controls; the figure shows signals with all probes and primers mixed in 1 reaction). E, Determination of working concentration for competitive internal control. A constant small amount of target gene RNA (solid line; 50 copies of ZEBOV transcript per assay) was amplified in the presence of increasing concentrations, as plotted on the X-axis, of the internal control (dotted line). Observed crossing point values were plotted on the Y-axis for both target genes (note that the virus and internal control carried different reporter dyes). Increasing values on the Y-axis indicate decreasing amplification efficiencies. From 40 copies of internal control onward, stable amplification was possible. From 400 copies/reaction (cps/rxn) onward, amplification of ZEBOV RNA lost efficiency, as is represented by the increasing crossing point value.",
