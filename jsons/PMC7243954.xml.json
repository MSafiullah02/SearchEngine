The anticancer target compounds reported by us and the literature reveal hazardous solvent usage, harsh reaction conditions, and longer reaction sequences. To overcome the above drawbacks and inspired by special features of both 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,4-oxadiaxole, we have to design and synthesize new amide functionality bearing 1,2,4-thiadiazole-1,2,4-triazole derivatives (8a\u2013j). These derivatives were examined for their anticancer activities against four different human cancer cell lines like breast cancer (MCF-7, MDA MB-231), lung cancer (A549), and prostate cancer (DU-145). These derivatives may act as drug lead molecules in cancer chemotherapy.",

The reaction mixture was stirred under atmospheric air at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h. After cooling to atmospheric temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate solvent (3 \u00d7 15 = 45 mL) and successively washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 (3 \u00d7 10 = 30 mL) and brine (10 mL).

The obtained results were presented as IC50 (\u00b5M) values in Table 1. The results indicated that most of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate to excellent anticancer activity aligned with four cell lines. Among the library of examined compounds, compounds 8b, 8c, 8d, 8e, 8g, and 8i displayed more potent activity with IC50 values ranging from 0.10 \u00b1 0.084 to 11.5 \u00b1 6.49 \u00b5M and standard showed IC50 value range as 1.91 \u00b1 0.84 \u00b5M to 3.08 \u00b1 0.135 \u00b5M. Further, all these compounds were investigated for structure\u2013activity relationship (SARs) studies. Compound 8b with electron-donating group (3,4,5-trimethoxy) showed highest anticancer activity toward MCF-7, A549, DU-145, and MDA MB-231 with IC50 values of 0.10 \u00b1 0.084 \u00b5M, 0.17 \u00b1 0.032 \u00b5M, 0.83 \u00b1 0.091 \u00b5M, and 0.28 \u00b1 0.017 \u00b5M, respectively, where slight decrease in activity was observed for 8c and 8d with IC50 values of MCF-7 = 1.12 \u00b1 0.64 \u00b5M; A549 = 1.79 \u00b1 0.59 \u00b5M; DU145 = 1.98 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b5M, MDA MB-231 = 2.33 \u00b1 1.52 \u00b5M, and MCF-7 = 1.44 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b5M; A549 = 2.10 \u00b1 1.44 \u00b5M; DU145 = 2.76 \u00b1 1.88 \u00b5M, MDA MB-231 = 2.35 \u00b1 1.51 \u00b5M, when compared with 8b compound.

When 3,5-dinitro group was introduced, 4-bromo substituents on the phenyl ring resulted compounds, namely 8f and 8h, were displayed very poor activity on all cell lines. Interestingly, compound 8i with 4-cyano electron-withdrawing group showed better anticancer activity (MCF-7 = 1.27 \u00b1 0.92 \u00b5M; A549 = 1.90 \u00b1 0.46 \u00b5M; DU145 = 0.60 \u00b1 0.014 \u00b5M, MDA MB-231 = 1.59 \u00b1 0.37 \u00b5M) than 8g.
