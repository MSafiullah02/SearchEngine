For the rapid viral antigen detection tests, traditional solid-phase immunoassay and immunofluorescence have a moderate sensitivity.15\n16 But their specificities to low prevalence disease are limited. The viral diagnostics were significantly promoted by the development of nucleic acids amplification techniques (NAAT).10\n15 This method enables the detection of low concentrations of viral nucleic acid.15 Moreover, NAAT are the only available method for most newly emerging respiratory viruses as traditional tests lack efficient cell-culture system or antigen detection methods.17 Currently, automated and multiplex NAAT have been developed to make it easier to obtain laboratory diagnostic results.18 These techniques are anticipated to be used for the cost-effective assessment of the antivirals for respiratory virus.",

N-(2-aminoethyl)-1-aziridine-ethanamine (NAAE) is a small molecule which inhibits interactions between the SARS-Cov spike protein and its cell surface receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).23 However, inhibition of ACE2 by NAAE also has a potential risk for hypertension.24 Hence, if the viral receptor is also important to cell function, agents that utilize this mechanism might cause side effects to the host too.",

            "text": "Persistent outbreaks of respiratory viral infections all over the world suggest that respiratory viral pathogens continue to be the most important threats to human health. Because of the the similarity of clinical symptoms to respiratory viral infections, rapid and sensitive diagnoses are essential for early viral identification and subsequently cost-effective monitoring of antivirals in clinical trials. The automated and multiplex NAAT may help to solve these problems, and this method is anticipated to generalize its applications in the future. There are still many challenges and unanswered questions about the development of antivirals. Several potent agents have been developed to target viral proteins or cellular factors essential for virus replication. However, they generally have yet to pass through clinical trials to show antiviral evidence in humans. On the other hand, the existing antiviral therapies also face the challenges of drug resistance and nonspecific side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel drugs and combination therapies. Efforts should be made to design and develop new antivirals that specifically target the basic steps of viral life cycle, including attachment, endocytosis, replication, assembly, budding, release, and cellular processes. The efficacy, viral resistance, mutual effect, and toxicity of combined usage of antivirals need to be clarified.",
