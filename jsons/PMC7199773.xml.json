Surprisingly, however, fewer confirmed cases in Taiwan compared to other countries near China, such as Korea and Japan, had occurred as of March 2020.12 One of the possible reasons for Taiwan\u2019s relatively low number of cases might be that Taiwan had learned important lessons from the epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that affected Taiwan in 2003. Therefore, swift and strict infection control regulations and actions, such as those pertaining to quarantines and community surveillance, were imposed and taken by the government.13\u201315 Restrictions on hospital visits were also suggested by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC).16",

We then recorded the details of the latest hospital visiting policies for ordinary wards of these hospitals by using the information provided on their official websites. We focused on the latest hospital visiting policies for ordinary wards, particular those that were updated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We grouped all 472 NHI-contracted hospitals into three categories (academic medical centers, metropolitan hospitals, and local community hospitals). We then browsed their official websites to determine whether or not their visiting policies for ordinary wards had been updated on their official websites. We also determined whether or not those hospitals with new visiting policies allowed visitors at all. However, the hospitals might still allow the visitors under some special situations, for example, the need to explain the clinical condition to the family, to make major medical decisions, to accompany the patient under surgery, regardless of their visiting policies. Therefore, in this study, we excluded these special situations and only discussed the visiting policies under usual situations in ordinary wards.",

The third category was defined as the rules pertaining to hand hygiene, which included whether hand sanitizing was accomplished by using soap and water, by using ethyl alcohol, or by using any kind of hand sanitizer.

Among the hospitals that still explicitly allowed visits to ordinary wards, most restricted visitors to two at a time and restricted visits to two visiting slots per day, consistent with the recommendations of the Taiwan CDC.16 These policies of restricted hospital visits are also similar to those for French intensive care units.20",

Most of the hospitals also mentioned other common infection control measures for visitors, including rules pertaining to TOCC history taking, body temperature monitoring, hand hygiene, and identity checks. Some hospitals placed automatic hand sanitizer dispensers and infrared thermal imaging systems at their entrances to help visitors follow the rules, while some even developed their own reservations systems for visits, such as systems using mobile applications and Google forms, in order to save time on history taking for and recording information about visitors. In addition, to prevent people from hiding their travel histories, the government has made it possible for medical staff to access the travel records of people through their NHI cards.25 That said, the thoroughness with which the visiting policies of hospitals have been enforced requires further investigation.",

Nearly two-fifths of the hospitals, primarily local community hospitals, did not have their own official websites or had not updated the information on their websites. Instead, they may have disseminated any updated policies through the news media, by posting them on social media sites like Facebook pages, or by placing notices at their physical entrances. As such, this study may have underestimated the total number of hospitals that made changes to their visiting policies. Moreover, the thoroughness with which hospital visiting policies have actually been enforced by the hospitals requires further investigation. Second, hospitals might change their visiting policies with the evolution of COVID-19. Besides, a local government might announce a stricter policy covering all hospitals within its administrative area. The temporal and regional differences could hardly be taken into consideration in our cross-sectional study. Third, we described the hospital visiting policies for ordinary wards in all of the hospitals in Taiwan. However, the visiting policies for special wards, for example, intensive care units, coronary care unit, baby rooms, were not included in this study. Therefore, the differences between the visiting policies for ordinary wards and special wards requires further study.26\u201328",
