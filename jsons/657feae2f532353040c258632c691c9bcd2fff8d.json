Highly virulent strains of Psa biovar3 (Psa3) have spread rapidly to kiwifruit production areas worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop critical management strategies for bacterial canker based on dissecting the interactions between Psa and kiwifruit. Here, we developed a rapid and reliable flood-inoculation method using kiwifruit seedlings grown on Murashige and Skoog medium. This method has several advantages over inoculation of conventional soil-grown plants. We demonstrated the utility of a kiwifruit seedling assay to study the virulence of Psa biovars and Psa3 virulence factors, including the type III secretion system (T3SS). Kiwifruit seedlings inoculated with Psa3 developed severe necrosis within 1 week, whereas those inoculated with a T3SS-deficient hrcN mutant of Psa3 did not. This method was also useful for analyzing expression profiles of genes involved in Psa3 virulence during infection, and revealed that the expression of genes encoding the T3SS and type III secreted effectors were strongly induced in planta. Our results indicate that the T3SS has an important role in Psa3 virulence, and the flood-inoculation assay using kiwifruit seedling is suitable for analyzing Psa and kiwifruit interactions.",

P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), causal agent of bacterial canker of kiwifruit, is an economically important pathogen worldwide. First reported in Japan, Psa causes severe damage to kiwifruit plants and decreases yields under optimal conditions (Scortichini et al. 2012; Takikawa et al. 1989) . Psa is organized into five biovars including biovar 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 based on biochemical, pathogenicity, and molecular characteristics of the Psa strains Sawada 2016, 2019) . The emergence of Psa3 strains with enhanced virulence was reported in 2008 in Italy, and a pandemic spread rapidly to kiwifruit production areas worldwide (Scortichini et al. 2012) . Major control strategies include chemical treatments such as copper fungicides and antibiotics (Cameron and Sarojini 2013) , but they are associated with potential risks such as induction of Psa resistance strains, phytotoxicity, and chemical residues in fruits (Nakajima et al. 2002; Serizawa et al. 1989; Vanneste and Voyle 2003) . Breeding for resistance is another control strategy, but cultivar development is slow (Kisaki et al. 2019) . Therefore, alternative management strategies based on the dissection of the dynamic interactions between Psa and kiwifruit are urgently needed.",

However, to functionally investigate the molecular interactions between plants and P. syringae, the inoculation assay should mimic natural infection and be suitable for high-throughput assays. P. syringae has two lifestyles, an epiphytic phase on the plant leaf surface and an endophytic phase in the apoplastic space (Melotto et al. 2008; Xin and He 2013) .

After the bacterial suspension was removed by decantation, plates containing inoculated plants were sealed with 3 M Micropore 2.5 cm surgical tape (3 M, St. Paul, MN, USA) and incubated at 22 \u00b0C with a light intensity of 150-200 \u03bcmol/(m 2 sec) and 12 h light/12 h dark. Symptoms were observed at 1-and 2-weeks post-inoculation (wpi). In each experiment, more than six plants were evaluated, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.",

Psa1-and Psa3-inoculated seedlings showed necrosis within 1 wpi, and severe disease symptoms at 2 wpi (Fig. 2a) . Among the Psa biovars, Psa3 caused the most severe symptoms (Fig. 2a) . Symptoms on Psa5-inoculated seedlings developed slower during the first compared to those on Psa1-and Psa3-inoculated seedlings, but developed typical symptoms such as leaf spots at 2 wpi (Fig. 2a) . Typical disease symptoms such as leaf spots can be seen in magnified images of Psa1-, Psa3-, and Psa5-inoculated seedlings at 2 wpi (Fig. 2a, bottom  row) . On the other hand, symptoms on seedlings-inoculated with Psa6 were only observed at 2 wpi (Fig. 2a) . Mild symptoms such as chlorosis without leaf spots can be seen in the magnified image of Psa6-inoculated seedlings. These results suggest that Psa6 shows the least virulence among the Psa biovars (Fig. 2a, bottom row) . Consistent with symptom development caused by the different biovars, Psa3 populations were the highest compared to those of Psa1, Psa5, and Psa6 (Fig. 2b) , and Psa6 populations were the lowest. We also observed bacterial colonies in kiwifruit seedlings by labeling the Psa biovars with the GFPuv protein. Interestingly, the bacterial colonies were clearly observed in Psa1and Psa3-inoculated seedlings at 6 days post inoculation (Fig. 2c) . To evaluate the utility of the kiwifruit seedlingflood inoculation assay for studying nonhost interactions, we inoculated kiwifruit seedlings with P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (Pst DC3000). Pst DC3000 did not induce HR cell death in the healthy-looking inoculated seedlings by 1 wpi (Supplementary Fig. S1a ). Pst DC3000 bacterial populations were also lower than those of Psa3 (Supplementary Fig. S1b ). Together, these results suggest that the kiwifruit seedling flood-inoculation assay is a reliable method to study Psa disease progression and to evaluate in planta bacterial growth.",

We thus investigated the expression profiles of these genes in wild-type Psa3 using RT-qPCR and gene-specific primer sets according to a previous study (McAtee et al. 2018; Supplementary Table S1 ). We carried out expression analysis using RNAs from flood-inoculated seedlings (Fig. 4a-h) and spray-inoculated plant leaves similar to the method used for Fig. 3 (Fig. 4i-p) . Our results demonstrated that expression of the alternative sigma factor hrpL, which controls the expression of T3SS effectors (T3SEs) (Fouts et al. 2002) , was clearly induced in planta (in flood-and in sprayinoculated kiwifruit plants) compared to culture in LB broth ( Fig. 4a and i) . In addition, the expression of Psa-conserved T3SS and T3SEs genes, including hrpA1, avrRpm1, hopR1, and hopZ3 were also induced in planta (Fig. 4j-l) , indicating that the T3SS is activated during Psa3 infection. We also investigated other P. syringae virulence genes (Ichinose et al. 2013; Ishiga et al. 2018; Ishiga and Ichinose 2016) . The oxyR and fliC transcripts, encoding transcription factors related to oxidative stress (Ishiga and Ichinose 2016) and flagellin (Shimizu et al. 2003) , respectively, were reduced in planta compared to levels produced in broth culture (Fig. 4f , g, and o). The expression of algD encoding an alginate biosynthesis enzyme (Yu et al. 1999 ) was induced in planta ( Fig. 4h and p) . Overall, we found that expression trends for most genes were the same between the two types of inoculation methods (Fig. 4) .

In addition, several studies reported that each Psa strain has T3SEs that are conserved among biovars as well as a unique set Sawada 2016, 2019; McCann et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2019 ).

            "text": "We also demonstrated that the expression of Psa3 genes encoding the T3SS and T3SEs was induced in planta compared to culture conditions in both flood-and spray-inoculated plants ( Fig. 4i-l) . Several transcriptome studies have been performed using different P. syringae pathovars including P. syringae pv. syringae (Pss) B728a, P. syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000, and Psa3 (McAtee et al. 2018; Nobori et al. 2018; Yu et al. 2013) . Yu et al. (2013) showed that expression of genes encoding the T3SS and T3SEs in Pss B728a was not strongly induced in the apoplast. In contrast, these genes were greatly upregulated in planta in comprehensive analyses of the expression profiles of Pst DC3000 and Psa3 (McAtee et al. 2018; Nobori et al. 2018) . One reason to explain the differences in the T3SS and T3SEs expression profiles in planta among P. syringae pathovars is their different lifestyles. Pss is known as a particularly successful epiphyte, whereas Pst DC3000 is a weak epiphyte (Lindow and Brandl 2003; Xin and He 2013) . A putative epiphytic phase was suggested for Psa3 on asymptomatic flowers and leaves (Gallelli et al. 2011; Stefani and Giovanardi 2011) ; however, how Psa modulates the epiphytic and endophytic phases and which genes arerequired for these phases has not been fully ascertained. Understanding Psa lifestyles will be critical to developing new management strategies for bacterial canker of kiwifruit. We believe that the flood-inoculation method will enable us to identify Psa genes required not only for virulence but also for epiphytic fitness and will provide critical clues to develop effective control strategies.
