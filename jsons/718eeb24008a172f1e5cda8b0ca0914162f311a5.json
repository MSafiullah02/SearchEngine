HCoV-NL63 is a group I strain that is more readily culturable from clinical specimens in tissue culture, whereas HCoV-HKU1 is a group II coronavirus; both have been reported from geographically diverse regions but were first described in the Netherlands and Hong Kong, respectively [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] , and they have been associated with a range of illnesses, from mild, febrile upper-respiratory-tract illnesses to severe illness, in hospitalized patients with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Reports describe these newer strains as occurring predominantly in children but also in adults [23] [24] [25] 34] . Among hospitalized patients in Hong Kong who have acute respiratory-tract infections, coronaviruses-including (in order of decreasing frequency) HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E-have been detected, by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in 2% of patients, who had an age range of 1 month-88 years [30] .

In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, HCoV-associated illness was statistically less likely than LDI to be associated with myalgia. Hence, HCoV infections were difficult to distinguish from LDI in this influenza-vaccinated population, whose influenzaassociated illnesses may have been less severe than those in an unvaccinated population. Illnesses not associated with either HCoV or LDI were not easily distinguishable, statistically, from HCoV. In previous analyses, influenza was more likely to be associated with fever, myalgia, and a worsening in FEV 1 than were noninfluenza acute respiratory illnesses [47, 48] . Acute respiratory illness, no matter the cause, was associated with significant worsening in the CLDSI score, but, on the basis of changes in FEV 1 , HCoV appeared to be less severe . Serologic and RT-PCR assays were used as complementary tests for detection of infection by HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. More illnesses were positive for HCoV by serologic than by RT-PCR criteria. Delays in collection of NOP specimens after the onset of symptoms of acute respiratory illness, as well as the long interval (\u03f37 years) between collection and assay of the samples, may have resulted in numbers of viral copies that were below the threshold for detection by the RT-PCR assay.",
