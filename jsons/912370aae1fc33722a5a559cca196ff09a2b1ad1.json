The ground state is analyzed as a function of the aspect ratio of the torus, which provides a non-local measure of the underlying Gaussian curvature, and the ratio of the defect core energy to the Young modulus. Several structural features are discussed, including a spectacular example of curvature-driven amorphization in the limit of the aspect ratio approaching one. The outcome of the elastic theory is then compared with the results of a numerical study of a system of point-like particles constrained on the surface of a torus and interacting via a short-range potential.",

We show that the ground state has excess 5-fold disclination defects on the exterior of the torus and 7-fold defects on the interior. The precise number of excess disclinations, as well as their arrangement, is primarily controlled by the aspect ratio of the torus. Since defective regions are physically distinguished locations, they are natural places for biological activity and chemical functionalization. A thorough understanding of the surface structure of crystalline assemblages could represent a significant step towards a first-principles design of entire libraries of nano and mesoscale components with precisely determined valence. Such mesoatoms could serve in turn as the building blocks for mesomolecules or bulk materials via spontaneous selfassembly or controlled fabrication.",

In Section 2 we review the elastic theory of defects in two-dimensional curved geometries and derive the ground state energy of a toroidal crystal. In Section 3 we summarize some fundamentals of the geometry of triangulated tori and discuss how the intrinsically discrete problem of crystallography can be reconciled with the result of the continuous elastic theory presented in the previous section. Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the crystalline structure arising from the solution of the elastic problem. In Section 5 we discuss the results of numerical minimization of the potential energy of a system of classical particles interacting via a short-range potential on the surface of a torus in the light of the results of Section 4. Finally, in Section 6 we specialize our analysis to the case of a \"fat torus\" of aspect ratio one and we show how the curvature singularity at the center of the torus is responsible for a remarkable curvature-driven transition to a disordered state. Some of the results presented here have been already announced in reference [15] .",

Reconciling the predictions of a continuum elastic theory with the intrinsically discrete nature of crystallography requires an understanding of the possible lattices that can be embedded on the torus and the associated defects. The problem of classifying the possible triangulations of the 2-torus has received considerable attention from mathematicians, physicists and chemists over the past twenty years. Lavrenchenko [19] proved in 1984 that all the triangulations of the torus can be generated from 21 irreducible triangulations by certain sequences of operations called vertex splitting 1 .

Defect-free toroidal deltahedra with an odd number of vertices are also possible and their construction is generally achieved by assembling congruent octahedral building blocks. An example of this scheme will be briefly discussed in Section 5 for the case V = 87 and r = 6. We refer the reader to reference [26] for a comprehensive review of the topic. The embedding of an equal number of pentagonal and heptagonal disclinations in the hexagonal network was first proposed by Dunlap in 1992 as a possible way to incorporate positive and negative Gaussian curvature into the cylindrical geometry of carbon tubules [20] . According to the Dunlap construction, the necessary curvature is incorporated by the insertion of \"knees\" (straight cylindrical sections of the same diameter joined with a kink) in correspondence with each pentagon-heptagon pair arising from the junction of tubular segments of different chirality (see Fig. 4 ). In particular, a junction between a (n, 0) and a (m, m) tube can be obtained by placing a 7-fold disclination along the internal equator of the torus and a 5-fold disclination along the external equator [28] . Since the radii of the two segments of a junction are different by construction, the values of n and m are commonly chosen to minimize the ratio |c (n,0) |/|c (m,m) | = n/ \u221a 3m. By repeating the 5-7 construction periodically, it is possible to construct an infinite number of toroidal lattices with an even number of disclinations pairs and dihedral symmetry group D nh (where 2n is the total number of 5-7 pairs, Figs. 5 and 6). The structure of the lattice is described by the alternation of two motifs with crystalline axes mutually rotated by 30 \u2022 as a consequence of the connecting disclination. One of the fundamental aspects of Dunlap's construction is that all the disclinations are aligned along the two equators of the torus where the like-sign Gaussian curvature is maximal. As we will see below, this feature makes these arrangements optimal in releasing the elastic stress due to curvature.",

A topological embedding of a graph in a two-dimensional manifold corresponds to a triangulation of the manifold if each region of the graph is bounded by exactly three vertices and three edges, and any two regions have either one common vertex or one common edge or no common elements of the graph. The simplest example of toroidal polyhedra with D nd symmetry group, featuring only 5-fold and 7-fold vertices, can be constructed by repeating n times the unit cell of Figure 7a . These toroidal antiprisms 2 have V = 4n vertices and can be obtained equivalently from the edge skeleton of a n-fold antiprism by attaching at each of the base edges a pentagonal pyramid and by closing the upper part of the polyhedron with n additional triangles. By counting the faces, one finds 2 Although we presume that this class of toroidal polyhedra is not discussed here for the first time, we could not find any previous reference in the literature. F = 5n + 2n + n = 8n from which V = 4n. The simplest polyhedron of this family has V = 12 and D 3d symmetry group (see top left of Fig. 8 ) and corresponds to the \"drilled icosahedron\" obtained by removing two parallel faces of an icosahedron and connecting the corresponding edges with the six lateral faces of an antiprism with triangular base (i.e. a prolate octahedron). Starting from this family of toroidal antiprisms a number of associated triangulations having the same defect structure can be obtained by geometrical transformations such as the Goldberg inclusion [30] [31] [32] . Such transformations, popularized by Caspar and Klug for the construction of the icosadeltahedral structure of spherical viruses [31] , consist in partitioning each triangular face of the original graph into smaller triangular faces in such a way that old vertices preserve their valence and new vertices have valence six. The partition is obtained by specifying two integer numbers (L, M ) which define how the original vertices of each triangle are connected by the new edges so that the total number of vertices is increased by a factor T = L 2 + LM + M 2 .",

With the help of numerical simulations (see Sect. 5) we found two other classes whose unit cell is shown in Figure 11 . Unlike Dunlap's toroids, the 7-fold vertices in these prismatic triangulations are not aligned along the internal equator of the torus, but rather grouped in dimers normal to the equatorial plane. 5-fold vertices are distributed along the external equator in the graph of Figure 11a or form a double ring above and below it in the case of the graph of Figure 11b . Toroidal deltahedra obtained by embedding the prismatic graphs of Figure 11 on a circular torus are shown in Figure 12 for the case of a 5-fold symmetric toroid with V = 35 and a 7-fold symmetric toroid with V = 49.

For dimensionless core energies below 4 \u00b7 10 \u22125 and aspect ratios r between 3.68 and 10.12 the ground-state structure is the TP5 lattice corresponding to a double ring of +1 and \u22121 disclinations distributed on the external and internal equators of the torus as the vertices of a regular decagon (the T 10 configuration).

In later molecular-dynamics simulations, Han [34] found that a 5-fold symmetric lattice, such as the one obtained from a (9, 0)/(5, 5) junction (see Fig. 6 ), is in fact stable for toroids with aspect ratio less then r \u223c 10. The stability, in this case, results from the strain energy per atom being smaller than the binding energy of carbon atoms. Irrespective of the direct experimental observation of such disclinated toroidal crystals, which is still open, we have shown here, from continuum elasticity, that a 5-fold symmetric lattice indeed constitutes a minimum of the elastic energy for a broad range of aspect ratios and defect core energies.",

In a manifold with variable Gaussian curvature this effects leads to a regime of coexistence of isolated disclinations (in regions of large curvature) and scars. In the case of the torus the Gaussian curvature inside (|\u03c8| > \u03c0/2) is always larger in magnitude than that outside (|\u03c8| < \u03c0/2) for any aspect ratio and so we may expect a regime in which the negative internal curvature is still large enough to support the existence of isolated 7-fold disclinations, while on the exterior of the torus disclinations are delocalized in the form of positively charged grain boundary scars.",

The problem of finding the minimal energy configuration of repulsively interacting points on a 2-manifold has become a standard problem of potential theory and has its paradigm in the classical Thomson problem on the sphere. The choice of the cubic potential is motivated here by the so-called \"poppy seed bagel theorem\" [38] , according to which the configuration of points that minimizes the Riesz energy E = i<j 1/|x i \u2212 x j | s on a rectifiable manifold of Hausdorff dimension d is uniformly distributed on the manifold for s \u2265 d. In the case of a torus of revolution this implies that for small s the points are mostly distributed on the exterior of the torus (the interior becomes completely empty in the limit V \u2192 \u221e). As s is increased, however, the points cover a progressively larger portion of the surface. The distribution becomes uniform for s \u2265 2. On the other hand, since the number of local minima of the Riesz energy increases with s, it is practical to choose a value not much larger than two. The choice s = 3 has the further advantage of modelling a real physical system of neutral colloidal particles assembled at an interface [39] and is therefore suitable for direct comparison with experiments on colloidal suspensions.",

            "text": "Some configurations deserve special attention. For V = 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 and r within a specific range (see Tab. 1) the global minima are represented by the secondto-sixth toroidal antiprims discussed in Section 3. The drilled icosahedron, on the other hand, would require the aspect ratio be less than one, as can be understood from Table 1 , and is therefore never a minimum for V = 12. We next describe the salient features of the four aspect ratios simulated. r = 3. The smallest minimal energy state with D 5h symmetry is obtained for V = 35. It features ten disclination pairs and belongs to the class of TP5a graphs. For V = 42, a TP6b lattice is obtained with no defects along the two equators. Two 6-fold chiral configurations are obtained for V = 60 and 126. The global minimum obtained for V = 130 displays a fascinating example of 5fold antiprismatic symmetry with the ten isolated negative disclinations in the interior of the torus replaced with a simplicial complex consisting of five triangles with a common 5-fold apex and four 7-fold coordinated vertices along the base. A peculiar example is also represented by the minimum obtained for V = 180. The lattice exhibits the typical pattern of a TPn graph with (3, 1, 4, 7)-type unit cell. The angular distance between neighboring disclina- tions is \u03b4\u03c6 \u223c 2\u03c0/9. Since a prismatic graph cannot have an odd number of disclination pairs, the toroidal lattice is closed by a simplicial complex consisting of two positive disclinations on the exterior of the torus at the opposite sides of the external equator and two negative disclinations in the interior arranged similarly. The total number of disclination pairs is therefore ten. The typical pattern of the 5-fold antiprismatic toroid can be found in all configurations with V > 200. A single 5-7-5 scar appears in the r = 3 configurations at V = 420, while larger lattices (i.e. V = 460 and 500) also feature 4-fold disclinations in the interior of the torus. It is not clear, however, whether the presence of disclinations with topological charge |q| > 1 is a genuine property of the ground state or rather an artifact due to a misconvergence of our algorithm. r = 4. An interesting feature is observed at V = 42. As in the case of r = 3, we also find a minimum with D 6h symmetry group, but unlike the latter configuration, it belongs to the TP6a class and has 5-fold disclinations along the external equator. A TP7b configuration is obtained again for V = 49. For V = 66 and V = 104 the global minimum is achieved by two spectacular antiprismatic configurations with D 11d and D 13d symmetry group, respectively. These toroids can be obtained from the toroidal antiprisms discussed in Section 3 by splitting 3 one or more times the initial set of 5-fold vertices. Thus starting from a 11-fold toroidal antiprism with V = 4\u00d711 = 44 vertices and splitting all 22 5-fold vertices, one obtains V = 44 + 22 = 66 vertices. Splitting twice all 26 5-fold vertices of a 13-fold toroidal antiprism with V = 4 \u00d7 13 = 52, on the other hand, we have V = 52 + 2 \u00d7 26 = 104. For V = 120 the global minimum is represented by a fascinating lattice of TP5a type. Lattices with V = 121, 125 and 126 resemble very closely the structure of a TP5 graph while for V = 260 the lattice has a more antiprismatic character with ten defect pairs. r = 6. Three defect-free configurations are found at V = 87, 112 and 116. The case V = 87 is a particular example of a defect-free lattice that cannot be obtained form the planar construction reviewed in Section 3. It consists of 29 octahedra connected in the form of a chain. Since each octahedron is attached to other two, it contributes with six faces to the total face count. Thus F = 6 \u00d7 29 = 174 and V = 174/2 = 87. For 180 \u2264 V < 460 we always find configurations with ten disclination pairs as expected from continuum elasticity. For V > 460 the regime of coexistence between isolated disclinations and scars described in Section 4.3 is observed. The delocalization of isolated disclinations into scars, however, does not take place at each defective site simultaneously and the regime of coexistence between positively charged scars and isolated 7-fold disclinations is preceded by a phase with isolated 5-and 7-fold disclinations and scars. For tori with aspect 6 The fat-torus limit",

            "text": "We have seen that disclination defects, forbidden in the lowest-energy state of a planar crystal, may be energetically favored on a substrate of non-vanishing Gaussian curvature. It is therefore natural to ask whether large curvature can completely destroy crystalline order by driving the proliferation of a sufficiently high density of defects. The resulting state would be amorphous. The problem of generating amorphous structures by tiling a twodimensional curved space with identical rigid subunits has drawn attention over the years, particularly through the connection to the structure of such disordered materials as supercooled liquids and metallic glasses. Since the work of Frank [41] , the notion of geometrical frustration arises frequently in investigations of supercooled liquids and the glass transition. A paradigmatic example is represented by the icosahedral order in metallic liquids and glasses which, although locally favored, cannot propagate throughout all of three-dimensional Euclidean space. A two-dimensional analog, consisting of a liquid of monodisperse hard disks in a 2-manifold of constant negative Gaussian curvature (the hyperbolic plane) was first proposed by Nelson and coworkers in 1983 [42] . In such a system the impossibility of covering the entire manifold with a 6-fold coordinated array of disks mimics many aspects of the geometrical frustration of icosahedral order in three dimensions. In all these models of geometrical frustration, however, the origin of the disorder is primarily due to the short-range nature of the potential between the subunits. In a more realistic setting, part of the frustration is relieved by the fact that hexagonal unit cells can compress in order to match the underlying geometry.",

            "text": "In this section we substantiate this claim analytically based on the elastic theory of continuous distributions of edge dislocations on a \"fat\" torus. Our argument is based on the following construction. As a consequence of the curvature singularity, the surface area of an arbitrary wedge of angular width \u0394\u03c6 becomes smaller and smaller as the sectional angle \u03c8 increases and vanishes at \u03c8 = \u03c0. If a defect-free lattice is embedded on such a wedge, Bragg rows will become closer and closer as the singularity is approached with a consequent rise in the elastic energy (see Fig. 21 ). An intuitive way to reduce the distortion of the lattice is to recursively remove Bragg rows as one approaches the point \u03c8 = \u03c0 (see Fig. 22 ). This is equivalent to introducing a growing density of edge dislocations. This dislocation \"cloud\" will ultimately disorder the system by destroying the local 6-fold bond orientational order. One might therefore view the curvature as playing the role of a local effective temperature which can drive \"melting\" by liberating disclinations and dislocations. In two-dimensional non-Euclidean crystals at T = 0, however, the mechanism for dislocation proliferation is fundamentally different from the usual thermal melting. While the latter is governed by an entropy gain due to unbinding of dislocation pairs, the amorphization at T = 0 is due to the adjustment of the lattice to the geometry of the embedding manifold via the proliferation of defects and the consequent release of elastic stress. A similar phenomenon occurs in the disorder-driven amorphization of vortex lattices in type-II and high-T c superconductors [43] .",

Using the elastic theory of defects on curved substrates, we identified the ground-state structures of an arbitrary crystalline torus as a function of the aspect ratio r and the ratio c /(AY ) of the defect core energy to the elastic energy scale. We showed that for a large range of aspect ratios and core energies the minimal-energy structure of a toroidal crystal has ten disclinations pairs and symmetry group D 5h , as first conjectured by Lambin et al. more than ten years ago [27] . For large system sizes we proved that isolated disclinations are unstable to grain boundary scars consisting of chains of tightly bound 5-7 pairs radiating form an unpaired disclination. On a torus, where the Gaussian curvature on the inside is always larger in magnitude than that on the outside, the occurrence of scars is marked by a state featuring isolated 7-fold disclinations in the inside of the torus together with scars on the outside. For a torus of aspect ratio close to one, we showed how a diverging Gaussian curvature on the internal equator is responsible for the remarkable occurrence of a curvaturedriven transition of the system to a disordered, liquid-like, state. The predictions of our elastic theory were compared with the results of a numerical study of a system of pointlike particles constrained on the surface of a torus and interacting via a short-range potential, with good agreement. From a purely geometrical point of view we have introduced a number of novel toroidal polyhedra as well as a new construction and classification scheme for certain types of prismatic tori.",

Hybrid algorithms, such as Basin-Hopping [46] and Minima-Hopping [47] , have been successfully employed throughout the years to predict the crystalline structure of molecular clusters and proteins. In general they combine fast local minimizations with global moves whose goal is to release the system from the local minimum it is confined at the end of a local minimization step. A typical hybrid optimization routine can be summarized in the following two steps: 1) After all the independent variables have been randomly initialized, a local optimization is performed and a local minimum x is determined. 2) From x a new configuration y is constructed by applying a global (generally stochastic) move. The new configuration y is then used as a starting point for a new local optimization step. The two steps are iterated until a stopping criterion is satisfied. The goal is thus to explore the largest possible number of local minima and avoid visiting the same minimum too often.",

The step is accepted with probability exp(\u2212\u03b2\u0394V ), where \u0394V is the energy difference between the new and previous minimum and \u03b2 is an inverse temperature adjusted to obtain a 50% acceptance ratio.

Consider a system of, say, spherical objects confined in a two-dimensional box with an initial disordered configuration. A common way to bias the system toward a close-packed configuration is to provide it with kinetic energy by gently tapping the box. If the system is populated by locally ordered regions (i.e. grains) separated by clusters of defects, the primary effect of tapping is to produce a glide of defects inside the crystals with a subsequent rearrangement of grains. This mechanism can be reproduced numerically in the following way. The algorithm starts with a random distribution of particles and rapidly quenches the system by performing a fast local minimization. Once particles are trapped in a local min-imum, defects are identified by a Delaunay triangulation of the lattice. Then the system is tapped by adding to the defect positions a random displacement. The magnitude of the displacement is given by the typical spacing associated with the particles number times a factor \u03bb which represents the tapping strength. This factor is initially set to 10 \u22123 . After defects have been moved a new local minimization is performed in order to construct the trial configuration y. The energy of this configuration is compared with the energy of the previous minimum and the move is accepted if their difference is larger than some tolerance factor E . If, on the other hand, the energy difference is smaller than E , the system has relaxed again to the same minimum. In this case the tapping strength is increased by a factor 10 and the process is repeated until the system successfully hops to a new minimum. The tapping strength \u03bb is then set to its initial value. The process is iterated until the rate of discovery of new global minima drops below some threshold value or a maximum number of iterations is reached.",

In the case of non-Euclidean crystals, where the conformation of the energy landscape is subtly related to the arrangement of topological defects, this mechanism is believed to explore the PES more accurately. In systems as Lennard-Jones clusters or spin-glasses, the PES is characterized by an exponential number of local minima separated by energy barriers. For this reason the majority of the algorithms are specifically designed to allow the system to overcome a barrier by providing it with a significant amount of energy. If the energy landscape, however, is characterized by the presence of multiple narrow funnels, as believed in this case, the previous methods become ineffective. A funnel represents the basin of attraction of a given local minimum. If the global minimum is also located at the bottom of a funnel, an algorithm that is attempting to locate it via a sequence of local minimization steps has a chance to find it exclusively by starting from a configuration already at the muzzle of the funnel. Such possibility, however, is ruled out if all the particles are displaced simultaneously during the escape move and the system is abruptly moved to a completely different place in the energy landscape. On the other hand, by adaptively tapping the defects, it is possible to achieve a much finer inspection of the PES and possibly locate the funnel associated with the global minimum.
