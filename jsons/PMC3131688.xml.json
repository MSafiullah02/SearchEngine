It is therefore not surprising that this mechanism \u2014 the lysosomal degradation pathway known as autophagy \u2014 is also used to degrade microorganisms (such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa) that invade intracellularly1,2. Indeed, the mutation of autophagy genes increases susceptibility to infection by intracellular pathogens in organisms ranging from plants to flies to worms to mice, and possibly to humans. Perhaps less apparent, but teleologically as intuitive, the autophagy pathway or unique functions of autophagy proteins also have a central role in controlling other diverse aspects of immunity in multicellular organisms.",

            "text": "The autophagy machinery is thought to have evolved as a stress response that allows unicellular eukaryotic organisms to survive during harsh conditions, probably by regulating energy homeostasis and/or by protein and organelle quality control. The same machinery might therefore be expected to diversify functionally in complex metazoan organisms, so as to regulate new layers of defences used by multicellular organisms to confront different forms of stress. A plethora of genetic, biochemistry, cell biology, systems biology and genomic studies have recently converged to support this notion. The autophagy machinery interfaces with most cellular stress-response pathways3, including those involved in controlling immune responses and inflammation. This interface is not only at the level of the autophagy pathway, but also entails direct interactions between autophagy proteins and immune signalling molecules4. There is a complex reciprocal relationship between the autophagy pathway/proteins and immunity and inflammation; the autophagy proteins function in both the induction and suppression of immune and inflammatory responses, and immune and inflammatory signals function in both the induction and suppression of autophagy. Moreover, similar to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and ageing5, defects in autophagy \u2014 through autophagy gene mutation and/or microbial antagonism \u2014 may underlie the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases and inflammatory syndromes.",

There are at least three different types of autophagy, including macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy and microautophagy. Macroautophagy, usually referred to simply as autophagy, is the subject of this Review (Fig. 1). In this pathway, a portion of cytoplasm (usually 0.5\u20131 \u03bcm in diameter) is engulfed by an isolation membrane, or 'phagophore', resulting in the formation of a double-membrane structure known as the autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome to become an autolysosome, leading to the degradation of autophagosomal contents by lysosomal enzymes. Autophagosomes can also fuse with endosomes or multivesicular bodies and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)- class-II-loading compartments7. Autolysosomes become larger as more autophagosomes and lysosomes fuse, but at a termination phase lysosomes are tubulated and fragmented for renewal8.",

Nonetheless, the molecular dissection of autophagy membrane dynamics, stimulated by the discovery of ATG (autophagy-related) genes in yeast9, has shed considerable light on this topic (Table 1). Several recent studies suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for autophagosome formation. The ER cisternae often associate with developing autophagosomes, and electron tomography analysis has demonstrated direct connections between the ER and autophagosomal membranes10,11. Moreover, the function of several key autophagy proteins seems to be at the level of the ER (Fig. 1).",

This leads to the recruitment of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) complex, which includes at least VPS34 (also known as PIK3C3), VPS15 (PIK3R4 and p150), beclin 1 and ATG14, to the ER13,14. The PI(3)K complex produces phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), which recruits effectors such as double FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) and WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting (WIPI) family proteins. DFCP1 is diffusely present on the ER or the Golgi, but translocates to the autophagosome formation site in a PtdIns(3)P-dependent manner to generate ER-associated \u03a9-like structures termed omegasomes15. Among the four WIPI isoforms, WIPI2 is the major form in most cell types and functions downstream of DFCP1, and it may promote the development of omegasomes into isolation membranes or autophagosomes16.",

Although VMP1 interacts with beclin 1 and is present at the autophagosome formation site at an early stage, it seems to function at a late stage in autophagy13,17,18. This is perhaps consistent with other evidence that beclin 1\u2013class III PI(3)K complexes may function in autophagosomal maturation (in addition to vesicle nucleation), a process that can be regulated by other beclin-1-interacting partners such as rubicon (Table 1). At the final step of autophagosome formation, elongation of the isolation membrane and/or completion of enclosure require two ubiquitin-like conjugates. The first is the ATG12\u2013ATG5 conjugate, which is produced by the ATG7 (E1-like) and ATG10 (E2-like) enzymes, and functions as a dimeric complex together with ATG16L1 (ref. 19) . The second is the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-conjugated ATG8 homologues \u2014 LC3, GATE16 and GABARAP \u2014 which are produced by the ATG7 and ATG3 (E2-like) enzymes9,20. Although the proteins involved in autophagosome membrane formation have been characterized as discrete complexes (Table 1), several potential interconnections between components of the different complexes were identified by a recent proteomics study21. Such interconnections may function in autophagosome membrane formation or other distinct cellular functions. For example, the ATG12\u2013ATG3 conjugate is implicated in mitochondrial homeostasis but not in autophagosome membrane formation22.",

ATG9, another multispanning membrane protein, is essential for autophagy23 and traffics between the trans-Golgi network, endosomes and autophagosome precursors24. Studies suggest that mitochondria, the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane could also be membrane sources for autophagosome formation25,26,27. However, the lack of detection of specific protein markers for these structures on the autophagosomal membrane leaves the decades-old question of the membrane source of the autophagosome unanswered. It is possible that cells may use different membrane sources to form the autophagosome in different contexts, thereby permitting specialization of membrane dynamics in a manner that allows divergent autophagy-inducing signals to stimulate the capture of spatially distinct cargo.",

These include autophagy-protein-facilitated fusion of bacteria-containing phagosomes with lysosomes, the envelopment of bacteria-containing phagosomes or endosomes by autophagosomal membranes, the fusion of bacteria-containing phagosomes or endosomes with autophagosomes, or the xenophagic capture of bacteria that have escaped inside the cytoplasm. In some cases, the route of autophagy-dependent targeting to the lysosome has been well defined, such as for group A Streptococcus that escapes from endosomes30.

Autophagy proteins are required for the fusion of phagosomes that contain Toll-like receptor (TLR)-ligand-enveloped particles with lysosomes in macrophages31, and for the fusion of phagosomes that contain TLR-agonist-associated apoptotic cell antigens with lysosomes in dendritic cells during MHC class II antigen presentation32. The self ligand and cell-surface receptor SLAM functions as a microbial sensor that recruits the beclin 1\u2013class III PI(3)K complex to phagosomes containing Gram-negative bacteria, facilitating phagolysosomal fusion and activation of the antibacterial NADPH oxidase (NOX2) complex33. In addition, the engagement of TLR or Fc\u03b3 receptors during phagocytosis recruits LC3 (and ATG12) to the phagosome through NOX2-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)34. Thus, in bacterial infections, a paradigm is emerging in which the coordinated regulation of microbial sensing, phagolysosomal maturation and antibacterial activity involves the recruitment of autophagy proteins to the phagosome. As a corollary, an interesting speculation is that impaired recruitment of autophagy proteins to the phagosome may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic granulomatous disease, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NOX2 gene (also known as CYBB) and characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and inflammatory complications, such as inflammatory bowel disease.",

A ubiquitin-independent pathway (that does not involve p62 or NDP52) could also function in targeting damaged Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs) to the autophagosome. In this pathway, a lipid second messenger, diacylglycerol, acts as a signal for the co-localization of SCVs with LC3-positive autophagosomes by a mechanism that involves protein kinase C and its downstream targets, JNK and NADPH oxidase39. The autophagic targeting of a cytoplasmic positive-strand RNA virus, Sindbis virus, also occurs in a ubiquitin-independent manner, but involves the interaction of p62 with the viral capsid protein40.

For example, Shigella vacuolar membrane remnants generated by bacterial T3SS-dependent membrane damage are targeted by polyubiquitination, p62 and LC3 for autophagosomal degradation41 (Fig. 2). These membrane remnants also accumulate numerous molecules involved in sensing and transduction of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signals, and there is an increase in nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-dependent cytokine production, ROS production and necrotic cell death in autophagy-deficient cells. Thus, the ubiquitin\u2013p62-dependent autophagic targeting of pathogen-damaged membranes could help to control detrimental downstream inflammatory signalling during bacterial invasion into host cells. Another emerging concept is that selective autophagy of viral proteins, similar to selective autophagy of aggregate-prone toxic cellular proteins, may protect post-mitotic cells such as neurons against cell death. For example, in Sindbis-virus-infected mice with neuron-specific inactivation of Atg5, there is an accumulation of Sindbis virus antigens (without increased levels of infectious virus), increased neuronal cell death and increased animal mortality40. Moreover, p62 is required for starvation and IFN-\u03b3-induced targeting of Fau (and perhaps other ubiquitylated protein complexes) to mycobacteria-containing phagosomes, resulting in the generation of antimycobacterial Fau-derived peptides42. The role of p62 in innate immunity is probably evolutionarily ancient, as the Drosophila p62 orthologue REF(2)P was originally identified in a screen for modifiers of sigma virus replication43.",

            "text": "The autophagy pathway and/or autophagy proteins have a crucial role in resistance to bacterial, viral and protozoan infection in metazoan organisms. The genetic deletion or knockdown of autophagy genes protects plants from viral, fungal and bacterial infection by preventing the uncontrolled spread of programmed cell death during the plant innate immune or hypersensitive response45. In other organisms, autophagy proteins function in a cell-autonomous manner to control infection by intracellular pathogens. In Drosophila, autophagy gene mutation increases susceptibility to viral (vesicular stomatitis virus)46 and bacterial (L. monocytogenes)47 infection. In Dictyostelium and Caenorhabditis elegans, autophagy gene mutation increases susceptibility to lethal S. Typhimurium infection48. In mice, knockout of Atg5 in macrophages and neutrophils increases susceptibility to infection with L. monocytogenes and the protozoan T. gondii35, and neuron-specific Atg5 knockout increases susceptibility to central nervous system Sindbis virus infection40. As noted in the next section, the autophagy pathway and proteins may also have 'proviral' or 'probacterial' effects in in vitro studies; however, in vivo evidence for such effects is so far lacking. The mechanisms by which autophagy genes mediate in vivo resistance to infection are not fully understood, but are likely to involve a combination of xenophagy, other autophagy-protein-dependent effects on microbial replication or survival, activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and/or alterations in pathogen-induced cell death (Fig. 3).",

Recent human genetic studies provide some clues. The immunity-related GTPase human IRGM, which regulates autophagy-dependent clearance of mycobacteria in vitro49, was identified as a genetic risk locus for tuberculosis in a West African population50. Numerous studies have shown a crucial role for autophagy in defence against mycobacterial infection in human cells1, and a genome-wide analysis of host genes that regulate Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication demonstrated that a predominance of factors were autophagy regulators51. Thus, it is possible that autophagy has a central role in resistance to one of the most important global infectious diseases \u2014 tuberculosis. Mutations in NOD2, which encodes an intracellular pathogen-recognition receptor (nucleotide-binding oligomerization-domain-containing protein 2) that functions in bacterial autophagy52,53, are also associated with susceptibility to infection with another mycobacterial agent, Mycobacterium leprae, the aetiological agent of leprosy54. An exciting future venture will be to confirm whether IRGM, NOD2 and other autophagy-related genes are involved in resistance to infection with mycobacteria and other infections in further human populations and, if so, whether this resistance is mediated by autophagy.",

An emerging theme is that microbial antagonism of autophagy not only blocks the xenophagic degradation of intracellular pathogens, but also blocks the functions of autophagy in innate and adaptive immunity.

The overlapping functions of the eIF2\u03b1 kinase signalling pathway in stress-induced general translational arrest, transcriptional activation of stress-response genes and stress-induced autophagy enable viruses to disarm several facets of the cellular stress response to infection by one mechanism \u2014 that is, antagonism of eIF2\u03b1 kinase signalling. The mTOR signalling pathway has a central role in the control of cell growth and metabolism, and interestingly, many of the viruses that activate mTOR are oncogenic (for example, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, hepatitis B virus and retroviruses). This suggests another type of pluripotent viral weapon \u2014 one that can promote oncogenesis by simultaneously inactivating autophagy and promoting cell growth through TOR activation. HIV envelope protein-dependent activation of mTOR signalling is also proposed to be a mechanism for HIV evasion of innate and adaptive immune responses in dendritic cells, including the degradation of incoming virions by lysosomes, blockade of HIV transfer to CD4+ T cells, stimulation of TLR4 and TLR8 ligand responses, and presentation of HIV Gag antigen to CD4+ T cells56.

Another possible mechanism for bacterial evasion of autophagy has emerged from a genome-wide screen to identify host factors that regulate the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis51. According to bioinformatics analyses, M. tuberculosis infection of human macrophage-like cells activates cellular pathways that inhibit autophagy. Intracellular bacteria that escape into the cytoplasm, such as S. flexneri and L. monocytogenes, use strategies to camouflage themselves to avoid autophagic recognition. The Shigella T3SS effector IcsB competitively binds to VirG, thereby preventing the interaction between ATG5 and VirG, a bacterial surface protein required for actin-based motility and Shigella targeting to autophagosomes38. The Listeria protein ActA interacts with cytosolic actin polymerization machinery (ARP2/3, VASP and actin), which blocks bacterial association with ubiquitin, p62 recruitment and autophagic targeting61. The precise mechanism of this block is unknown, but it has been proposed that the ActA-dependent recruitment of host cell cytoskeletal proteins may enable the bacterium to disguise itself as a host cell organelle61.

Autophagy may assist in HIV biogenesis, because the processing of the HIV envelope precursor protein Gag and extracellular viral release are enhanced by the autophagy machinery63. Similarly, autophagy proteins are required for maximal levels of poliovirus egress55. Another newly defined proviral function of autophagy is its role in productive hepatitis C virus replication; several different autophagy proteins (such as beclin 1, ATG4B, ATG5, ATG7 and ATG12) assist in the translation of incoming, but not progeny, viral RNA64. ATG7 and class III PI(3)K activity also enhance hepatitis B virus DNA replication65.",

It is possible that autophagy proteins function to provide membrane for viral replication complexes or translation machinery. This may be true for viruses such as hepatitis C virus, for which genetic knockdown of several different autophagy genes decreases productive replication64. However, for other viruses such as coronaviruses, the biogenesis of double-membrane, ER-derived vesicles used for replication proceeds through a pathway that involves the non-lipidated form of LC3 (LC3-I) but not the general autophagy machinery66.

High mobility group box (HMGB) proteins have also been shown to function as both universal sensors of nucleic acids in innate immune signalling67 and inducers of autophagy68. Autophagy is inhibited by BCL2, NF-\u03baB, T helper 2 (TH2) cytokines and the canonical nutrient-sensing insulin\u2013AKT\u2013TOR pathway. Inactivation of this nutrient-sensing pathway may contribute to vesicular stomatitis virus stimulation of autophagy in Drosophila46, and autophagy activation in C. elegans with loss-of-function mutations in this pathway may mediate pathogen resistance in long-lived mutant nematodes48. Thus, both 'immune-specific' and more general nutrient-response signals control autophagy in response to infection.",

Although cathelicidin is required for vitamin-D3-dependent transcriptional upregulation of autophagy genes such as BECN1 and ATG5, and vitamin D3 enhances the recruitment of cathelicidin to autophagosomes, it is not yet clear how cathelicidin promotes autophagy. Nonetheless, these observations may begin to provide some insight into the century-old Nobel prize award (Niels Ryberg Finsen, 1903) for the use of ultraviolet-light therapy (which generates active vitamin D3) in the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis.",

These findings raise the possibility that cytokines may have a broader role in the control of autophagy than previously thought. Moreover, because these cytokine signalling pathways are important in immune cells, another central question is to what extent cytokine-mediated regulation of autophagy governs immune cell function. Given the general function of autophagy in cellular homeostasis5, and the more specific functions in regulating immune and inflammatory signalling (discussed in 'Regulation of immune signalling by autophagy proteins'), cytokine-mediated changes in autophagy levels in immune cells may have a central role in immunity and inflammation.",

In T cells, in which mitochondrial numbers are developmentally regulated during the transition from thymocyte to mature circulating T cell, the developmental defect in autophagy-deficient cells may be related to the defective clearance of mitochondria44. Another crucial function of autophagy in the development and homeostasis of the immune system is the elimination of autoreactive T cells in the thymus44. High levels of autophagy are present in thymic epithelial cells, in which autophagy participates in the delivery of self-antigens to MHC class II loading compartments. Genetic disruption of Atg5 in thymic epithelial cells leads to the altered selection of certain MHC class II restricted T-cell specificities and autoimmunity73. Beyond these functions in lymphocyte survival and thymic negative selection, autophagy may exert other functions in lymphocyte differentiation, perhaps, in part, indirectly through effects on cytokine expression (see the next section). It is not yet known whether autophagy is involved in the development and/or homeostasis of immune cell populations other than lymphocytes and haematopoietic stem cells.",

The discovery that autophagosomes could deliver endogenous antigens to MHC class II loading compartments sheds light on one of the central mysteries of antigen presentation \u2014 how the immune system elicits CD4+ T-cell responses to antigens that originate in all parts of the cell. The autophagic delivery of endogenously synthesized antigens for MHC class II presentation has been demonstrated in vitro for certain viral antigens75, and probably explains the essential role of Atg5 in vivo in negative thymic selection73. However, the relative importance of this pathway in antigen presentation during infection in vivo is not yet known. There is nonetheless interest in exploiting this pathway for optimizing vaccine-elicited CD4+ T-cell responses, by either pre-treating dendritic cells with autophagy-inducing agents in cell-based vaccine strategies or fusing antigens with LC3 to enhance their targeting to autophagosomes1.",

Atg5-deficient dendritic cells have normal migration, innate responses, endocytic and phagocytic activity and cross-presentation of peptides on MHC class I molecules. However, they exhibit defects in phagosome-to-lysosome fusion and in cross-presentation by MHC class II molecules of phagocytosed antigens containing TLR ligand. Thus, the interior of the phagosome, like that of the autophagosome, is a cellular compartment that autophagy-protein-dependent antigen presentation accesses to generate peptides for presentation to CD4+ T cells. A potential evolutionary advantage of this autophagy-protein-dependent cross-presentation is that, by delegating antigen presentation duties to uninfected dendritic cells, the host can bypass the blockade of antigen presentation that may result from microbial antagonism of autophagy in infected cells.",

Moreover, the autophagy protein ATG9A, but not ATG7, negatively regulates the activation of STING, a transmembrane protein that is required for efficient activation of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to stimulatory DNA23.

However, this hypothesis has not yet been tested. The three major Crohn's-disease-associated NOD2 variants (a frameshift mutant and two missense mutants) may be loss-of-function mutants, with impaired muramyl dipeptide (MDP)-induced inflammatory signalling86. How the loss of function of a pro-inflammatory signal mechanistically contributes to an inflammatory disorder has been unclear, but the recently discovered links between NOD2 and autophagy may solve this conundrum. In primary immature human dendritic cells, NOD2 is required for MDP-induced autophagy, a process that is essential for the MHC class II presentation of bacterial antigens to CD4+ T cells and for bacterial targeting to lysosomes52. Dendritic cells expressing Crohn's disease NOD2 risk variants are defective in both of these functions52.

However, it is not yet known how the T300A mutation affects the function of the mammalian ATG16L1 protein. This mutation resides in the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain that is absent in yeast Atg16 and is dispensable for autophagy. Although some studies have suggested that the ATG16L1(T300A) variant has reduced autophagic clearance of enteric pathogens such as adherent-invasive Escherichia coli87 or S.

As noted earlier, loss of Atg16l1 function in mice results in enhanced TLR-agonist-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages82, enhanced DSS-induced colitis82,90 and altered inflammatory gene transcriptional profiles in Paneth cells81,90. In addition, the Paneth cells of mice expressing low Atg16l1 levels (Atg16l1HM) show defects in the packaging and extrusion of antimicrobial granules into the gut lumen; Paneth cells from patients with Crohn's disease and the ATG16L1(T300A) risk variant show similar defects81. This suggests that, in addition to the overlapping functions of NOD2 and ATG16L1 in a common bacterial-sensing pathway that promotes bacterial antigen presentation, ATG16L1 may have unique protective functions, including Paneth cell antimicrobial peptide release and the negative regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. To connect the striking phenotypes in Atg16l1-mutant mice and the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease in humans with the ATG16L1(T300A) risk allele, the precise effects of the T300A mutation on ATG16L1 protein function need to be uncovered.",

In mice raised in a pathogen-free facility, only Atg16l1HM mice (and not wild-type mice) infected with a virus found in routine conventional animal facilities, a murine norovirus, showed abnormal Paneth cell granule secretion, Paneth cell pro-inflammatory gene-expression profiles, and intestinal inflammation in response to DSS treatment90. This mucosal inflammation depended on the presence of the microbiome and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as it was reversed by antibiotic treatment or by TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 inhibition. Thus, variations in a host autophagy gene, exposure to a specific virus and the microbiome can act together to trigger intestinal inflammation in mice that is similar to that in patients with Crohn's disease. Although environmental factors, including the gut microbiome, have long been suspected to contribute to Crohn's disease in genetically susceptible individuals, formal proof of this concept was lacking, and viruses were a previously unsuspected trigger. Another implication of this work is the concept that autophagy proteins, through their diverse roles in immunity and the control of inflammation, may serve as a central rheostat that prevents inflammatory diseases triggered by environmental stress (Fig. 4).",

Although the effects of these SNPs on ATG5 expression and function are not known, the lack of Atg5-dependent negative thymic selection generates autoimmunity and multi-organ inflammation in mice73. Loss of other ATG5-dependent effects, including regulation of IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion77,78, clearance of dying cells84 and dendritic cell antigen presentation32, might also contribute to the autoimmunity and inflammation associated with SLE.

Although most components of the metabolic inflammasome promote autophagy, the induction of autophagy by this signalling complex would be expected to serve as a negative-feedback mechanism that limits ER stress and disease progression. Consistent with this postulated protective effect of autophagy, hepatic suppression of the autophagy gene Atg7 in mice results in increased ER stress and insulin resistance95, and mice deficient in the autophagy adaptor protein p62 develop mature-onset obesity and insulin resistance96. Furthermore, obesity is associated with the accumulation and activation of macrophages and subsets of T cells in adipose tissue and the production of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 (ref. 97).

The top right box shows a model of our current understanding of the molecular events involved in membrane initiation, elongation and completion of the autophagosome. The major membrane source is thought to be the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), although several other membrane sources, such as mitochondria and the plasma or nuclear membrane, may contribute. After induction of autophagy, the ULK1 complex (ULK1\u2013ATG13\u2013FIP200\u2013ATG101) (downstream of the inhibitory mTOR signalling complex) translocates to the ER and transiently associates with VMP1, resulting in activation of the ER-localized autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) complex, and the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) formed on the ER membrane recruits DFCP1 and WIPIs. WIPIs and the ATG12\u2013ATG5\u2013ATG16L1 complex are present on the outer membrane, and LC3\u2013PE is present on both the outer and inner membrane of the isolation membrane, which may emerge from subdomains of the ER termed omegasomes. The cellular events that occur during autophagy are depicted in the bottom diagram, including the major known cellular and microbial proteins that regulate autophagy initiation, cargo recognition and autophagosome maturation. Only those cellular proteins known to be adaptors for targeting microbes are shown; other proteins (not shown) also function in cargo recognition of mitochondria and other organelles.

The postulated mechanisms by which defects in autophagy protein function might contribute to the development or perpetuation of intestinal inflammation are based on studies in vitro and animal models. There is no direct evidence that autophagy defects contribute to human Crohn's disease, although mutations in three autophagy-related genes, ATG16L1, NOD2 and IRGM, are known to enhance risk of the disease.
