Viruses are recognized as the predominant causative agents of acute respiratory infections. In Senegal, few data concerning the causes of respiratory infections are available, and those known relate mainly to classical influenza infections. Clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections was carried out in a rural community in children less than 5 years old. A standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient. These samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR or by viral culture. A total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included, and 48 (58.5%) were found to be positive, with a total of 55 viral detections; several samples were positive for two (n \u00bc 5) or 3 (n \u00bc 1) viruses. Ten different viruses were identified: influenza viruses A, B, and C (n \u00bc 25), human respiratory syncytial virus type A (n \u00bc 13), rhinoviruses (n \u00bc 8), human coronaviruses type 229E and NL63 (n \u00bc 6), parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 (n \u00bc 2), and bocavirus (n \u00bc 1). These results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in Senegal. The establishment of sentinel surveillance sites could help estimate the burden of acute respiratory infection in the pediatric population and should help prepare the health care systems to identify and respond to new viral respiratory emergencies.",

Acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child morbidity and mortality throughout the world [Williams et al., 2002] . However, until recently acute viral respiratory infections were not considered to be a major public health concern. The 1997 H5N1 influenza outbreak in Hong Kong, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 due to a coronavirus, and the current emergence of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) variant [Novel swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation Team, 2009] emphasize the risk posed by acute viral respiratory infections in humans. These outbreaks emphasize the difficulties faced by unprepared publichealth authorities and populations. The first two events of zoonotic origin were linked to farming practices, and were exacerbated by market trading in livestock; the current novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) variant epidemic is still under investigation. The risk of an influenza A virus pandemic, particularly due to an H5N1 virus or to the novel A (H1N1) variant, or of a further SARS-like epidemic has led public health authorities to implement or reinforce surveillance of acute respiratory infections in humans.",

Little is known about the respiratory viruses responsible for upper and lower acute respiratory infections circulating in the human population in tropical areas. Therefore, clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections is essential for public health, and children represent a key target population. In this context, it is important to develop and to implement diagnostic tools to identify other viruses involved in respiratory illnesses. Standardized procedures of collection, storage, and transportation of viral samples from the field to the laboratory should be implemented. Some respiratory viruses are diagnosed directly by a combination of isolation in cell culture and antigen detection, but often samples remain negative. Molecular biology techniques have been developed in recent years and multiplex RT-PCR methods are useful for the detection of viruses causing acute respiratory infections.",

The clinical team of a primary care center collected a total of 82 nasopharyngeal samples between mid-June and December 2007 from children under 5 years of age who presented signs of acute respiratory disease. At least ten different viruses circulating in the two test villages during the rainy season were detected using viral culture and PCR. Children with respiratory virus infections experienced respiratory symptoms consisting mostly of upper respiratory symptoms. As expected, influenza viruses and hRSV were detected most frequently. Rhinovirus [Peltola et al., 2008] and human coronaviruses were associated with respiratory symptoms in a quarter of the children. The frequency of PIV was remarkably low in this study; in the USA peaks of PIV are reported during the cold season [Fry et al., 2006 ]. In our communitybased study, bocavirus was co-detected with influenza virus A and NL63 in only one episode, as expected from previous reports [Falsey et al., 2005; Longtin et al., 2008] . Bocavirus co-detected with influenza virus A and NL63 was not associated with a lower respiratory tract infection, as has been reported in rural Thailand [Fry et al., 2007] . Adenovirus or human metapneumovirus were not detected, possibly due to the small number of lower respiratory cases examined [Arnold et al., 2008] and the small number of acute respiratory infections in very young children in this study [Regamey et al., 2008] .",

The distribution of hRSV in sub-tropical countries throughout the year is still unknown; in Europe and the USA, symptomatic hRSV infections occur mainly in young children during the cold season [Meerhoff et al., 2006; CDC, 2007] . However, two simultaneous clusters of acute respiratory infections were observed: one consisted of influenza virus A and occurred in Dielmo, whereas the other cluster concerned hRSV in Ndiop between mid-September and mid-October. The two villages are close geographically to each other, but the biotope is very different and rural exchanges are rare. hRSV transmission in humans may occur through children or adults, including individuals without or with mild, symptoms [Falsey et al., 2005] . Among the 12 acute respiratory infection episodes associated with hRSV, episodes of clinical bronchiolitis were not reported (children were aged between 4 and 37 months). The absence of clinical bronchiolitis is possibly due to the role of breastfeeding in this population, where indeed women continue breastfeeding their children for up to 24 months (mixed J. Med. Virol. DOI 10.1002/jmv milk feeding). Also, the rural environment may protect children from severe forms of hRSV disease, whereas in urban areas, air pollution may act as a trigger in severe acute bronchiolitis cases [Diouf et al., 2003; Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2007; Karr et al., 2007; Segala et al., 2008] .",
