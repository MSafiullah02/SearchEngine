            "text": "Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) possess significant antiviral and cytostatic activity.1 These nucleotide analogs contain an isopolar phosphonomethyl moiety instead of the nucleotide phosphate ester group which excludes their enzymatic degradation and/or eliminates problems linked to intracellular phosphorylation necessary for nucleoside activation. They are excellent templates for drug design because of the absence of the labile glycosidic bond and the flexibility of the acyclic chain which enables the compounds to adopt a suitable conformation in their target enzyme. Among ANPs, 2-(phosphonomethoxy)alkyl derivatives of purine and pyrimidine bases are particularly potent. 9-[2-(Phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]adenine (PMEA, Fig. 1\n) is active against DNA viruses and retroviruses2; its prodrug, adefovir dipivoxil3 has been approved for hepatitis B virus therapy (Hepsera\u2122).4 Attachment of the hydroxymethyl group to the 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl chain leads to another active compound, (S)-9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] adenine ((S)-HPMPA, Fig. 1), with potent anti-DNA-viral activity.5 Substitution of the aliphatic PMEA side chain by the methyl group results in (R)-9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] adenine (PMPA, Fig. 1) with high potency and selectivity against HIV-1 and HIV-26; its oral prodrug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been approved for treatment of HIV infection (Viread\u2122) and recently also HBV infection.6c\n",

For this extensive series of \u03b2-branched PEE\u2013ANPs we decided to improve our previously published method10 for the preparation of diethyl 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)alkylphosphonates 3a\u20133c. The procedure was significantly simplified and can provide convenient and rapid access to a broad spectrum of phosphonate derivatives. The main improvement compared to our previously published step-vise procedure10 was the one-pot sequence without the isolation of the branched alcohol after the first step. Starting from commercially available diethyl methylphosphonate (Scheme 1\n), diethyl lithiomethylphosphonate preformed in situ in dry THF under argon atmosphere was reacted with the corresponding aldehydes. The resulting intermediate 1 was directly alkylated by ethyl bromoacetate under mild conditions to avoid elimination reaction. The ethyl (alkoxy)acetate moiety in compound 2 can serve as a latent hydroxyethyl group. These esters 2 were reduced by borane in THF to obtain desired hydroxy derivatives 3 with the already built-in ether bond. The overall yield of the three step sequence was 69% for 3a and 58% for 3d.",

However, the cystostatic activity of 9a in CEM cells (CC50\n = 20 \u00b1 6.3 \u03bcM) may account for the anti-HIV activity observed and thus, the observed anti-HIV activity might not be due to a direct inhibition of virus replication, but rather an indirect cellular antimetabolic activity. Compound 9a also demonstrated a higher cystostatic activity against the cell cultures compared to compounds 9b and 9c. As observed for their cytostatic activity against human fibroblast HEL cell proliferation, when evaluated against murine leukemia cells (L1210), murine mammary carcinoma cells (FM3A) and human T-lymphocyte cells (CEM), 9a was far more cytostatic than 9b and 9c (Table 2\n).",

The antiviral assays, other than HIV, were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (\u223c3 \u00d7 105\n cells/ml) were infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV-1(IIIB) or HIV-2(ROD)/ml and seeded in 200-\u03bcL-wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds.

CC50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds.
