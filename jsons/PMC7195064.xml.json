Authors state that \u201cRegarding postponement or interruption of treatment for COVID-19 positive patients during scenario 2, since the consensus in Scenario 1 was to postpone and interrupt in all situations, it was concluded that treatment would be postponed/interrupted until the patient recovers and is COVID-19 negative in Scenario 2 as well, since it is a more extreme example.\u201d If applied to every patient, this clinical behaviour seems to us to significantly hamper the possibility of cure for a relevant number of COVID-19 positive cases. Because of its high incidence and severity, this is particularly worrisome for stage III disease (that in fact is judged to have a very high priority when triaging patients during the late phase of the pandemic). The global burden of lung cancer is very high (11.6% of all cancers, 2.093.876 cases worldwide in 2018, according to Globocan; https://gco.iarc.fr/today/data/factsheets/cancers/15-Lung-fact-sheet.pdf, accessed April 11, 2020).",

Death rate for COVID-19 infection is far from being accurately defined, but available estimates range between 2 and 8% [3]. This trade off needs to be discussed with a patient. Delay or simply renounce to treat these patients might well be their main cause of death, especially when treatment is interrupted after a significant number of fractions.",
