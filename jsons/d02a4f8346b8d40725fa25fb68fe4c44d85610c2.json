In this study, we use computable statistical methods, to investigate the correlations between, different scientific research records on the COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from investigating the connections between different topics, we also investigate the data records for patterns in the response from different countries. Our objective is that by investigating individual responses, we can provide scientific insights into some of the emerging concerns in the media, e.g. the World Health Organisation (WHO) speed of response 1 . There are topics that we consider beyond the scope of this study, such as the concerns on the origin of the disease 2 .

Since research data records are often categorised by year and not by months, it could be challenging at a future date to find scientific data to model, with precision, the research response at different stages of the response. We considered this study to be of significant relevance in this stage of the pandemic, because it provides statistical results that can be seen as a snapshot in time. Our rationale was based on the fact that the pandemic has been in existence for a few of months, and the scientific per-review process last few months. Hence, we assume that at present, we are reviewing research papers that have been produced at the beginning of the pandemic, and just published online now.",

We used the historical data records, to compare with the current scientific research on COVID-19, and we use quantitative analysis to derive unexpected conclusions on the speed of response, from the most prominent organisations in pandemic research. In the investigation, we applied cluster analysis, anomaly detection analysis, association rule mining, and sequential pattern mining, among other methods. The findings of this study are presented in groupings of data records, and categorisations of patterns from the input data, which can be used or reproduced in future studies for predictive analytics, e.g. forecasting of insights on monitoring and management of future pandemics.",

Scientometric analysis is focused on the performance of different authors, or journals. The bibliometric analysis in this article is focused on analysing national responses, institutional outputs, and the correlations between research findings. Similar research is present from March 2020 [2] , and presents analysis of 564 data records. Since then, the number of scientific research data records has increased to 3094. In addition, we use different statistical methods in our data mining and visualisation, which enables us to compare the COVID-19 analysis, with 138,624 historical data records on pandemics and epidemics. This is significantly different that a bibliometric analysis of 564 data records. The third study we reviewed to structure our research questions, was a study from March 2020, based on 183 data records from PubMed and analysed Identified and analysed the title, author, language, time, type and focus [3] .

To repeat this process on 138,624 data records, we would need to extract 277 separate data files, and merge into one. This was considered tiresome and not practical.

In the first wave of the pandemic, the focus seems to have been predominantly on the medical aspects. Learning from this result, we can conclude that all other research areas become secondary in the immediate threat of pandemics -death. Therefore, scientific research on these topics should be ongoing and constantly advancing, in anticipation of similar pandemics happening in the future, without notice. To analyse if such preparations were happening in the past, we analyse the data records on COVID-19, and we compare the results with a historical analysis of data records on pandemic management. In Figure 2 , we categorise the data records by country. From Figure 2 , we can see that most scientific research is happening in the US and China, followed by the UK and Italy. Those are some of the worst affected countries at this present time. Although Spain and Iran are also in the hardest hit countries, the scientific research from these two countries is not showing as strong. Therefore, it is indicative, but not conclusive that countries that are most affected, are also most productive in terms of scientific research.",

This could signify that the world, for unclear reasons, was slow in responding with scientific research on COVID-19. We could speculate that the world didn't take COVID-19 seriously, or that Chinese knew something that the rest of the world didn't, but we have no data to confirm such speculations. What we can confirm with certainty, is that the Chinese research institutes acted much faster than the rest of the world, including the leading research organisation on pandemics and epidemics. What we can see in the categorisation by funding (based on the 3094 data record file) in Figure 7 , is that China is in the lead, but the US has more distributed funding programme, and if we sum up all the funding, we could get a different result.

We exported two separate text files and we used the two files for the data mining with VOSviewer. In Figure 9 , we can see the VOSviewer visualisation by country and collaborations between countries. In VOSviewer, we can select specific relationships of one country, and we can zoom in the image for more detailed data mining. It is however relatively easy to identify the US, England, Australia and China as the leading countries in the top 1000 historical data records on pandemics and epidemics. The Figure 9 and Figure 10 are both based on Lin/Log modularity normalisation. We conducted normalisation by association strength, and by fractionalisation normalisation, but the Lin/Log modularity normalisation presented better visualisation of the research collaborations between countries. For data mining on collaborations between institutions, we used associated strength normalisation, and since we wanted to investigate the collaborations, we set a limit on data records that included collaborations, this reduced our data records from 1000 to 90 analysed in Figure 11 .",

The difference in the visualisation is that in Figure 12 we can see the keywords associations between data records from individual country.

To find a regression function, that estimates the relationship between data records, with the smallest amount of error, we developed a collaboration network map (Figure 13 ), using country in the network parameters, with equivalence normalisation, in a circle network layout, using Louvain clustering algorithm and the minimum number of edges set at 2.",

Just to clarify these connections in the collaboration network map, edge density equals number of edges divided by maximal number of edges. Hence, an edge density in Figure 14 is defined of overlapping and weighted in graph communities. However, it is possible that edge variations in multiple keywords mainly reflect the variations in few underlying keywords. Hence, in Figure 15 , we applied factorial analysis as a statistical method to identify joint keywords in response to unnoticed (concealed) keywords. The parameters we applied in the factorial analysis (Figure 15 ), included 'multicorrespondence analysis', with field of analysis being the keywords of the records, with automatics clustering and a maximum number of terms 50. In Figure 15 we describe variability among the correlated keywords with potentially lower number of unobserved keywords (factors), aiming to identify independent latent keywords. In other words, we wanted to reduce the number of keywords in the data records. Our objective was to find the latent factors that create a commonality in the data records, and we applied factorial analysis because it is a statistical method that can identify smaller number of underlying variables, within large numbers of observed variables 4 .",

Wuhan University is currently very high in the classification of scientific research on COVID-19. In the alternative classification, using historical records on most prominent organisations in this field, the Wuhan and Teheran Universities are not present in the statistical classification. This triggers many questions on have the leading organisations on pandemic and epidemic management reacted as the appropriate speed? Is so, why are they behind in the production of scientific journal? Has there been a gap in communications and data sharing? Leaving these organisations oblivious to what was happening? Or was it that our global alert mechanisms failed to act? Did we ignore the warning signs? These are just some of the emerging questions from this study. Until these questions are answered, conspiracy theories would continue to spread. With the COVID-19 pandemic slowing down, we should also be seeking answers to these questions to prevent a second wave, and most importantly, to prevent the same mistakes happening in future pandemics.",
