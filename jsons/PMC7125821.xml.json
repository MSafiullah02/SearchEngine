This condition may be caused by trauma or underlying lung disease, but sometimes happens spontaneously without obvious cause. When a pneumothorax develops, there is loss of the negative intrapleural pressure that is needed for lung inflation, and the lung on the affected side collapses and cannot expand properly. This collapse leads to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch because there is continued perfusion of a poorly ventilated lung. Arterial hypoxemia can occur with 50% collapse of the lung. If there is a continued air leak with increasing positive intrapleural pressure, this can lead to a tension pneumothorax and can lead to compromise of venous return to the heart, decreasing cardiac output, and causing hemodynamic collapse.",

Forty-six percent of patients with primary pneumothorax wait more than 2 days after onset of symptoms before seeing a physician.4 Patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax may have more severe symptoms because they have less pulmonary reserve because of their underlying lung disease. On physical examination, patients typically have decreased breath sounds, decreased chest excursions, and hyperresonant percussion on the affected side. Subcutaneous emphysema may also be present. If the patient has any hemodynamic instability, the concern for a tension pneumothorax must be raised. Additional signs of a tension pneumothorax include significant respiratory distress, tachypnea, distended neck veins, pulsus paradoxus, displacement of the point of maximal cardiac impulse, and trachea shift. These signs are often late and emergency treatment must be initiated with an urgent thoracostomy tube or temporary decompression of the chest with a 14- to 16-gauge needle or catheter placed in the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line on the affected side.",

A white visceral pleural line can be seen outlining the collapsed lung border (Fig. 1\n). Lateral displacement of the mediastinum and/or trachea and downward displacement of the diaphragm can be seen with a tension pneumothorax. According to the British Thoracic Society guidelines, a pneumothorax is defined as small if the distance from the chest wall to the visceral pleural line is less than 2 cm, or large if the distance is greater than 2 cm.4 However, the American College of Chest Physicians defines small pneumothoraces as those in which the visceral pleura is less than 3 cm from the chest wall and large pneumothoraces as those more than 3 cm.3 The chest cavity is a three-dimensional space and it is difficult to accurately calculate the size of the pneumothorax using plain chest films. It has been estimated that, if the pneumothorax is 1 cm wide, it accounts for 25% of the hemithorax volume. A 2-cm pneumothorax can occupy up to 50% of the chest cavity. In patients with COPD, a large apical bulla can be misdiagnosed as a pneumothorax because of a similar appearance on chest radiograph. Chest computed tomography (CT) can help differentiate between these two conditions and provide information on underlying lung pathology. A large left-sided pneumothorax may lead to a right-sided shift in the QRS axis on an electrocardiogram, with a decrease in the precordial R wave voltage. In general, once the pneumothorax is treated, the electrocardiogram reading will return to normal.7\n",

These blebs are often found at the apex of the upper lobe or the superior segment of the lower lobe. An additional 5% to 10% of patients have bullae that are larger than 2 cm.

Even if no abnormalities were found in the lung, resection of the apex decreased the recurrence rate.18 It is important to combine a resection with a technique that locally fuses the pleural space to reduce the recurrence rate. This fusion can be achieved by pleurectomy, pleural abrasion, or pleurodesis. All these methods create an inflammatory reaction causing the lung to adhere to the chest wall, thus precluding collapse of the lung in the event of another parenchymal air leak. Thus, the procedure does not prevent an air leak from occurring; instead it is aimed at preventing a significant pneumothorax from developing. When used alone, the recurrence rate after pleurectomy is 1% to 5%.19 Pleural abrasion is technically easier and is associated with fewer hemorrhagic complications than pleurectomy. In a review of 9 case series, the recurrence rate of pneumothorax after pleural abrasion alone was 2.3%.20 Chemical pleurodesis can be used at the time of surgery, or via a chest tube in patients who are not candidates for surgical intervention. Talc is most often used for chemical pleurodesis, but autologous blood, bleomycin, tetracycline, and doxycycline have all been used.21, 22 Talc is a powder of hydrous magnesium silicate and is extremely effective in inducing pleural adhesions. Talc pleurodesis is effective, with recurrence rates of 5% to 8% when patients are treated with talc pleurodesis alone.23, 24 However, it induces fever and pain and, in up to 2% of patients, the associated pneumonitis can induce respiratory failure.25 In addition, there is concern about the long-term consequences of leaving foreign material (talc crystals) in the chest cavity in young patients. Intrapleural injection of tetracycline alone is less effective and has been associated with recurrence rates of 16%.26 Injection of tetracycline or doxycycline can be painful and it is important to premedicate patients with analgesics. Intrapleural lidocaine injection can be added to help with analgesia.",

There were no significant differences between operative failures, duration of chest tube drainage, treatment failures, or recurrences with the two approaches.27 A systematic review of the literature comparing VATS with traditional surgical approaches also found decreased use of pain medication and shorter hospital stay in the patients having VATS.28 Whenever possible, a VATS approach should be used to treat pneumothoraces when surgical intervention is indicated.",

As with open bullectomy, care must be taken when entering the pleura to avoid injuring the underlying lung, and a complete adhesiolysis is needed to visualize the bulla to be resected. The bulla can be partially opened to obtain adequate visualization. Once the bulla is identified, a stapled bullectomy can be performed with sequential firings of a buttressed endoscopic stapler, in a manner similar to the open bullectomy.59, 60, 61, 62 The underlying lung is reinflated under direct vision; if the underlying lung does not reinflate, bronchoscopy should be performed to suction clean the involved airways. When there has been chronic collapse of a section of lung, it can sometimes be difficult to re-expand. Typically, the airway pressure necessary to inflate the collapsed segment is high and, as a consequence, the abnormally compliant diseased lung is preferentially inflated. If this occurs, it can be useful to pass a small catheter through the working port of the bronchoscope and apply gentle jet ventilation to the airway leading to the collapsed lung segment.",

A segment of rib is resected, and the parietal pleura adjacent to the bulla is incised. An incision is made on the lateral wall of the bulla, and any septae in the interior of the bulla are excised. Two purse-string sutures are placed around the hole in the bulla, and a 32 French Foley catheter is inserted into the bulla to serve as an endocavitary drain. The balloon on the Foley is inflated, the purse-string sutures are tied, and suction is applied to the Foley, collapsing the bulla. The pleural drain is discontinued after 48 hours, whereas the endocavitary drain is removed in 8 to 21 days.67, 68\n",

Patients with severe, incapacitating emphysema are considered for surgical intervention. A structured pulmonary rehabilitation program is a critical first step in determining suitability for an operation. The program should include abstinence from tobacco products, an exercise training program, optimization of medical treatment, patient education, and psychosocial assessment. Exercise training is designed to increase endurance and decrease exertional dyspnea. Patients enrolled at the authors\u2019 LVRS program are required to complete an exercise program that has a goal of 30 minutes of daily continuous exercise, 5 days a week, on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals and Organizations also uses a minimal performance of 3 minutes of unloaded pedaling on a stationary bicycle as a prerequisite for LVRS surgery in the United States. A significant number of patients achieve enough improvement in their symptoms that they decline LVRS after undergoing exercise-based pulmonary rehabilitation.84, 85 Exercise tolerance also has an important postoperative predictive value: the NETT trial demonstrated that, in patients with upper lobe predominant disease, patients with high exercise tolerance (ie, less impaired by the disease) did not have the same survival benefit from surgery as those more impaired patients with low exercise tolerance.86 However, other clinical trials have amended enrollment criteria after observing an excessive mortality in the patients with the poorest exercise abilities. It is clear that patients selected for surgical therapy must be impaired enough to merit the risks of surgery, but not so ill that they cannot participate in physical therapy.",

Bronchodilator therapy is useful for alleviating symptomatic airflow limitation; however, many patients use appropriately prescribed inhalers incorrectly. Assuring the correct use of inhalers should be a component of any medical evaluation. Many patients with stable COPD symptoms use long-term corticosteroid therapy, despite the absence of prospective data supporting a benefit of steroids on lung function or its rate of decline. As such, tapering the use of corticosteroids preoperatively to the lowest possible dose is advised in an effort to avoid the associated risks of poor wound healing and infection.",

Rest and stress echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculograms, thallium imaging, and other studies can assist with cardiac risk stratification. However, the patient with COPD provides several unique challenges to these modalities, limiting the usefulness of such tests. Exercise testing is rarely useful because of the patient\u2019s inability to exercise to maximal heart rates. Chest hyperinflation can limit the visualization afforded by echocardiography, and concerns about bronchoconstriction may limit the use of dipyridimole or adenosine. As such, many otherwise acceptable surgical candidates eventually undergo right and left heart catheterization just before surgery. Any intervention must be coordinated among all physicians involved, because the placement of a drug-eluting coronary stent in a preoperative patient can have major implications on the timing and the conduct of the surgery.",

Resting and exercise arterial blood gas analyses indicate the patient\u2019s pulmonary reserve, and reflect their potential for recovery after surgery.
