The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, is closely related to the SARS-CoV 4 which caused the SARS epidemic in 2003. As a consequence of SARS, Singapore set up a series of national prevention and response measures including the creation of a Disease Outbreak Response System Condition 5 (DORSCON) (supplementary Table S1 , available at Annals of Oncology online). On 7 February 2020, Singapore's DORSCON level was escalated from yellow to orange signifying community transmission, triggering heightened surveillance, border control, containment protocols, and widespread contact tracing.",

Physicians' leave was cancelled to maximize manpower resources. Physician subteams were further geographically confined to specific ward, outpatient, and office areas to minimize exposure and crosscontamination (supplementary Figure S1 , available at Annals of Oncology online). Each outpatient sector had its own registration counter, triage, venipuncture service, consultation rooms, isolation rooms, and lavatories, to facilitate contact tracing. In the cancer pharmacy, one team carried out dispensing of outpatient prescriptions and review of chemotherapy orders, while the other team compounded chemotherapy, managed investigational studies, and stored inventory (supplementary Figure S1 , available at Annals of Oncology online). Each team at the radiotherapy treatment center comprised radiation oncologists, radiation therapists, physicists, nurses, and administrative staff.

For patients undergoing radiation therapy, hypofractionated treatments were favored, while specialized procedures such as stereotactic body radiotherapy, radiosurgery, and brachytherapy were limited. In the inpatient setting, cancer surgeries were allowed to proceed as planned but all non-cancer surgeries were postponed by 3 months. Hospital negative-pressure isolation rooms were reassigned to the pandemic team for COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases. Due to an anticipated shortage of these rooms hospital-wide and the nursing complexity of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients, low-risk suspected COVID-19 HSCT patients were kept in the HSCTunit high-efficiency particulate airfiltered single rooms with an antechamber. Non-HSCT hematology patients who were low-risk suspected cases for COVID-19 were admitted to neutral pressure isolation rooms, rather than negative pressure rooms, thereby preventing them from being exposed to other nosocomial infection sources. A nationwide blood product shortage resulted from social distancing practices, cancellation of mobile blood drives, and stringent donor screening. For cancer patients, blood stocks were conserved for emergency surgeries, active bleeding, and semi-elective cancer surgeries. Red cell and platelet transfusion were limited per patient and lower hemoglobin thresholds were accepted for asymptomatic patients.",

Public hospitals in Singapore are integrated with the national DORSCON system, providing clarity on triggers for change to workflow. Strong leadership and rapid communication ensured quick implementation of protocols and changes. Nevertheless, the long-term feasibility of these workflows is unknown. The impact of COVID-19 on treatment and outcomes of patients with cancer, patients' perspectives, the psycho-emotional impact on health care workers, and economic repercussions are important areas of future research. While the overall principles are similar to those reported by colleagues in the USA 9 and UK, 10 the concept of centerwide team segregation is central to our approach and was guided by our experience from the 2003 SARS epidemic. In the last 6 weeks we have had an opportunity to stress-test this model. We show that despite COVID-19 community transmission, the segregated team model allowed the continuation of cancer care and clinical trials, and may be replicable in other similar centers globally. While the exact workflow will be center-specific, we hope that the principles of the segregated team approach described here may provide a modifiable framework for local strategy planners in cancer centers at high risk for COVID-19 transmission.",
