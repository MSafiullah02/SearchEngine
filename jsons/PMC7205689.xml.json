            "text": "The current study had three aims. The first aim was to identify youths\u2019 motivations for social distancing. We expected youth to endorse a wide variety of social distancing motivations, including those reflecting personal desires or autonomy (e.g., not wanting to personally get sick), prosocial action (e.g., not wanting others to get sick), and control (e.g., parental or state rules). The second aim was to determine the extent to which different motivations were related to the degree of social distancing. We expected that youth who endorsed autonomy and prosocial motives would engage in social distancing to a greater extent relative to those who did not endorse these motives. The third aim was to examine connections between social distancing motivations and adolescents\u2019 mental health and social health. We expected that youth who endorsed autonomous or prosocial motives would report better mental and social health. Past research has found consistent demographic differences in adolescents\u2019 mental health, with adolescent girls, minority youth, older youth, and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds having greater anxiety and depressive symptoms [16]. Thus, the current study accounted for these demographic differences to isolate links between social distancing motivations and mental and social health.",

The sample was composed of primarily females (75.3%) with 22.7% males and 4.9% identifying as non-binary.

As a proxy for family financial strain [18], youth were asked whether their families had: enough money to buy almost anything they wanted (7.7%), no problem buying the things they need and can also sometimes buy special things (53.6%), just enough money for the things they need (31.5%), or a hard time buying the things they need (7.2%). All youth reported that their school had been temporarily closed to facilitate social distancing at the time of data collection. A total of 13 youth (1.9%) were missing data on social distancing engagement and motivation and were removed from the sample.",

A single item created for the purpose of this study was used to capture the extent to which youth perceived that they were engaging in social distancing. This perception-based assessment of social distancing was utilized given the lack of validated measures of social distancing, the large degree of heterogeneity in how youth could exercise social distancing, and the relevance of perceived social isolation compared to objective social isolation for mental health [19]. Participants were asked \u201cIn the past 7 days, to what extent did you engage in social distancing?\u201d. Response options were given on a 5-point scale including 1 (not at all), 2 (a little), 3 (somewhat), 4 (a lot), and 5 (a great deal) with an option to indicate that they did not know what social distancing was. If participants reported engaging in \u201ca little\u201d to \u201ca great deal\u201d of social distancing, they were presented with a list of motivations for social distancing, which was created based on remote online discussion with a small focus group of teens (n = 3). A total of 10 motivations were presented (see Table 1\n). Participants were able to select all motivations that applied to them and an \u201cother\u201d option was provided along with an open-ended text box for teens to provide more information. A small percentage of teens selected \u201cother\u201d (n = 29, 4.4%), and a review of these qualitative responses indicated that each response qualified as one of the other already provided categories, suggesting that the majority of teens\u2019 motivations were captured.",

Additionally, this study did not capture adolescents\u2019 reasons for not engaging in social distancing and future research may benefit from understanding why some youth are not social distancing to a greater degree. Social distancing was measured using a single-item that captured youths\u2019 perception of whether they were social distancing. Although perception-based measures were used given the relevance of perceived social isolation for mental health [19], it is unknown how these perceptions align with objective social distancing or whether the single-item captures engagement in multiple forms of social distancing. Future research is needed to examine multiple facets of youths\u2019 social distancing using validated measures. The burdensomeness and belongingness measures used in this study were adapted for repeated assessment and were composed of only a few items, and social health may be better assessed using a larger battery of questions [25].",

Specifically, our findings highlight that social distancing may be more or less problematic for youth depending on their reason for engagement. Parents, educators, and policy makers may benefit from understanding why teens are social distancing, present alternative reasons to social distance, or help guide motivations in a way that that might promote compliance. Overall, our findings highlight that adolescents have varied motivations for complying with social distancing recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that these motivations may be indicative of individual differences in how social distancing may impact teens. Future research should explore moderators of these associations between mental health and experiences with social distancing or isolation from peers (e.g., introversion / extraversion). It will be important to continue to monitor teens\u2019 motivations for social distancing and their connections with compliance and mental health as these associations may change as the pandemic evolves and social distancing may occur for an extended duration.\n",
