In several countries considered to be free of terrestrial rabies, rabid bats and human cases of bat-associated rabies have been identified in the last decades, such as in Australia where three human cases have occurred and in the United Kingdom, with one human case in Scotland (Banayrd et al. 2011; Fooks et al. 2003). In Latin America, more human rabies cases are now related to bat exposure (especially vampire bats) than to dog bites (Condori-Condori et al. 2013).",

            "text": "In Latin America, a review of the literature through 1990 reported 330 cases of bat-transmitted human rabies (Schneider et al. 2009). These cases, along with PAHO data to the end of 2006, revealed 637 reported cases of bat-transmitted human rabies in Latin America. Of 199 human cases transmitted by bats during the period 1996\u20132006, 146 (73 %) were transmitted by vampire bats, 16 (8 %) by non-vampire bats, and 37 (19 %) with no species reported (Schneider et al. 2009). For instance, in Peru, during 2002\u20132007, 293 (77 %) of the rabies cases diagnosed were associated with vampire bats, whereas 87 (23 %) were related to dog rabies virus variants (Condori-Condori et al. 2013). It was also shown that vampire bat rabies variants spread gradually and involve different vampire bat subpopulations with different transmission cycles. Bovine paralysis caused by rabid vampire bat bites also has a major economical impact on cattle production in Mexico and several South American countries (Streicker et al. 2012). Emergence of rabies in insectivorous bats in several countries in Latin America (such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay) has also been reported.",

Most EBLV-2 isolates originated from the United Kingdom (UK) and The Netherlands, and EBLV-2 was also detected in Germany, Finland and Switzerland. There have been 25 suspected cases of EBLV-2, of which 22 have been confirmed. In addition, limited isolations of unique lyssaviruses from European insectivorous bats were reported in south-west Russia in 2002 (West Caucasian bat virus), in Germany in 2010 and France in 2012 (Bokeloh bat lyssavirus) (McElhinney et al. 2013; Picard-Meyer et al. 2013), and Lleida bat lyssavirus was recently identified in a bent-winged bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Spain (Ar\u00e9chiga-Ceballos et al. 2013). A few human cases related to bat exposure have also been reported from Europe.",

Initial signs include headache, slight fever, malaise and pain at the bite wound. The disease which lasts from 2 to 6 days without medical support, progresses to paralysis of the muscles of deglutition, hyperesthesia and generalized convulsions. Death ensues shortly thereafter (Hoar et al. 1998). In bats , infection rate and mortality is usually low, although this has been studied in few species. Experimental studies in vampire bats indicate that a high viral load is necessary to induce mortality, with either no observable clinical signs or squeaking, tremor, paralysis and loss of appetite (Aguilar-S\u00e9tien et al. 2005). In cattle infected by vampire bats, rabies is mainly expressed by paralysis with a rather long incubation period (25\u2013150 days or more) and lasts for 2\u20135 days before causing death (Hoar et al. 1998).",

As of December 2012, a total of forty-five outbreaks of Hendra virus have occurred in north-eastern Australia, all involving infection of horses (Aljofan 2013). As a result of these events, 90 animals (88 horses and two dogs) have died or been euthanized. These cases have all occurred in Queensland and in north\u2013east New South Wales. Case fatality rate in humans is 60 % (4 of 7 recorded cases) and in horses 75 %. Human infections with Hendra virus range from mild influenza-like illness to fatal respiratory or neurological disease. Infected people initially develop fever, headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), sore throat and a dry cough. They could also have enlarged lymph nodes, lethargy and vertigo. The incubation period ranges from five to 14 days. Hendra virus is transmitted to people through close contact with infected horses or their body fluids. To date, no human-to-human transmission of Hendra virus has been documented. No specific treatment is available, but a vaccine has been developed for immunization of horses and is available since the end of 2012. The following signs have all been associated with Hendra virus cases in horses, but not all these signs will be found in any one infected horse: rapid onset of illness, increased body temperature/fever and heart rate, discomfort/weight shifting between legs, depression and rapid deterioration with either respiratory and/or nervous signs. Respiratory signs include respiratory distress, increased respiratory rates, nasal discharge at death that can be initially clear until progressing to stable white froth and/or stable blood-stained froth. Nervous signs include wobbly gait, apparent loss of vision in one or both eyes, aimless walking in a dazed state, head tilting and circling, muscle twitching, urinary incontinence and inability to rise. Horses get infected when very high concentrations of virus material are deposited directly under trees in what is call the \u2018drip zone\u2019 and almost no virus is deposited once the horses leave the perimeter of the trees. This area of the trees where the spats and the urine of feeding flying foxes will be dropped potentially poses an extremely high risk for horses (Australian Veterinary Association: http://www.ava.com.au/hendra-virus).",

There were 265 patients, of whom 105 died, reported as having NiV induced viral encephalitis, mostly among adult males who were involved in pig farming or pork production activities. However, the reported number of patients who survived the acute NiV encephalitis was 160 with 7.5 % prevalence of relapsed encephalitis (12/160 patients) more than 24 months after the outbreak. Of the 89 patients previously known to have non-encephalitic or asymptomatic Nipah virus infection, three (3.4 %) developed late-onset encephalitis. Most patients presented with a severe acute encephalitic syndrome, but some also had significant pulmonary manifestations.

A second outbreak in India, close to the Bangladesh border, was reported in 2007. Sequencing and genetic characterization of these isolates revealed that they were closely related to, but distinguishable from the causative agent of disease in Malaysia. Since the emergence of NiV in Bangladesh and India, over 200 human cases have been identified, with an overall case fatality exceeding 70 %. Most cases are related to consumption of unwashed fruits or palm juice contaminated by fruit bats secretions (saliva, urine, fecal materials). Outbreaks in Bangladesh and India were characterized by bat-to-human and human-to-human transmissions. Pteropus spp. serve as the wildlife reservoir for NiV across a wide area of South-east Asia, including countries from which no known outbreaks have emerged such as Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.

The virus isolates were collected 9 months apart, demonstrating long-term virus circulation. The bat colony was estimated to be over 100,000 animals using mark and re-capture methods, predicting the presence of over 5000 virus-infected bats.

Moreover, Q-RT-PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues were found, consistent with potential for oral, urine, fecal or sexual transmission. The combined data for R. aegyptiacus tested from Python Cave and Kitaka mine indicate low level horizontal transmission throughout the year. However, Q-RT-PCR data showed distinct pulses of virus infection in older juvenile bats (~6 months of age) that temporarily coincide with the peak twice-yearly birthing seasons. Retrospective analysis of historical human infections suspected to have been the result of discrete spillover events directly from nature found 83 % (54/65) events occurred during these seasonal pulses in virus circulation, perhaps demonstrating periods of increased risk of human infection.",

During the latter outbreak several epidemiological investigations were conducted to identify the underlying ecological conditions and animal sources. Qualitative social and environmental data were collected through interviews with villagers and by direct observation (Leroy et al. 2009). The local populations reported no unusual morbidity or mortality among wild or domestic animals, but they described a massive annual fruit bat migration toward the southeast, up the Lulua River. Migrating bats settled in the outbreak area for several weeks, between April and May, nestling in the numerous fruit trees in Ndongo and Koumelele islands as well as in palm trees of a largely abandoned plantation. They were massively hunted by villagers, for whom they represented a major source of protein. By tracing back the initial human-to-human transmission events, it was shown that in May the putative first human victim bought freshly killed bats from hunters to eat. This study provided the most likely sequence of events linking a human Ebola outbreak to exposure to fruit bats, a putative virus reservoir. Such findings support the suspected role of bats in the natural cycle of Ebola virus and indicate that the massive seasonal fruit bat migrations should be taken into account in operational Ebola risk maps and seasonal alerts in the DRC (Leroy et al. 2009).",

            "text": "A succession of phylogenetic and epidemiological findings suggested that SARS had a wildlife origin, and that \u2018wet markets\u2019 in southern China were the origin of the outbreak. Subsequently, two groups independently identified SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) in species of bats in China. Li et al. (2005) reported serological and molecular evidence of a cluster of SARS-like coronaviruses in several species of free-living horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) in southern China. They contend that the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak in humans in 2003 emerged from this cluster of viruses, and that bats are the origin of the SARS coronavirus. Rhinolophus species are more likely to foster host shifts of coronaviruses than other bat species; this propensity, when combined with the potential for close contact between bats, civets and humans in the wildlife trade in southern China, supports SARS-like coronaviruses as being the source of the SARS coronavirus (Field 2009). The majority of the coronaviruses originated from African, Asian and European bats (Corman et al. 2013). In addition to SARS-CoV, four human coronaviruses (HCoVs), termed HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 are known. Recently, a sixth HCoV was described, the MERS-CoV, which can cause coughing, fever, and pneumonia. This virus emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has been reported in some other Gulf States, France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and Britain [all cases to date can be epidemiologically linked to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Jordan]. The MERS virus so far (September 2013) has killed 51 people out of 135 confirmed cases of infections worldwide (ProMed, MERS-COV (71) 20130919). Close relatives of this betacoronavirus termed MERS-CoV and of HCoV-229E exist in Old World bats and HCoV-NL63 could be grown in immortalized bat cells, demonstrating the zoonotic potential of previously reservoir-bound bat CoVs. The recent description of a bat CoV related to MERS-CoV in Mexican bats (Anthony et al. 2013) and in bats from Saudi Arabia (Memish et al. 2013) emphasized the relevance of investigating neo-tropical bats for CoVs.",

A variety of different Salmonella serotypes have been isolated from apparently healthy and diseased bats . Almost all of them are serotypes with a broad host-range. Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium have been frequently identified, which belong to a small group of Salmonella serotypes mainly associated with disease in humans and animals. Both serotypes have been isolated from organ tissues of three individual bats of the family Vespertilionidae that were found dead or severely injured near human habitations (M\u00fchldorfer 2013). It was also reported in vampire bats (Hoar et al., 1998). In Trinidad, of 377 tested bats, representing 12 species, four bats (1.1 %) were positive for Salmonella spp., 49 (13.0 %) were positive for E. coli, and no bats were positive for E. coli O157 or Campylobacter spp . (Adesiyun et al. 2009). Isolated serotypes of Salmonella included Rubislaw and Molade, both from Noctilio leporinus, a fish-eating bat, Caracas recovered from Molossus major, and Salmonella Group I from Molossus ater, both insect-eating bats. Of the 49 isolates of E. coli tested, 40 (82 %) exhibited resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents.",

Phylogenetic analyses of Bartonella strains derived from bats identified several distinct phylogroups indicating the presence of a variety of novel Bartonella species in bats.

The prevalence of leptospiral infections in bats varied from almost 2\u201335 % depending on the sample size of the respective study. The family Phyllostomidae comprised the majority of microbats infected with Leptospira, whereas in obligate insectivorous species (i.e. families Vespertilionidae and Molossidae) leptospiral infection with pathogenic strains has occasionally been found. In Australia, native flying fox populations (genus Pteropus) were suggested as possible carriers of pathogenic Leptospira responsible for infections in humans and other animals because of high bacterial detection rates in kidney (11 %) and urine samples (39 %) and high seroprevalences (18, 28 %) (M\u00fchldorfer 2013). Similarly, bats from Madagascar and Comoros islands harbor a notable diversity of Leptospira spp. ; a finding similar to the diversity found in a comparable investigation of bats in the Amazon region (Lagadec et al. 2012; Matthias et al. 2005). Leptospirosis incubation is 1\u201332 days (median 9 days) and median duration is 14 days. Most symptomatic patients develop a mild illness consisting of fever, chills, headache and myalgia. Severe forms of the disease may manifest in acute renal failure, hepatitis , jaundice, myocarditis and meningoencephalitis and outbreaks of severe pulmonary hemorrhagic leptospirosis have occurred resulting in high morbidity and mortality (Leshem et al. 2011).",

It has expanded beyond its natural range and is becoming increasingly urban (Shapiro et al. 2013). Using PCR and PCR-RFLP, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis was detected in two bats (Chiroptera) in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, an endemic area. The animals testing positive were found in both a rural site and an urban site. These results indicate the need for further research into the viability of Leishmania in bats. It could have implications for public health in that part of Brazil, given the large populations of urban bats, their mobility, and their ability to roost at close proximity to humans within residences and other buildings (Shapiro et la. 2013).",

            "text": "\nHistoplasmosis: Histoplasmosis is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum\n, a dimorphic fungus that is endemic in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa (Hoar et al. 1998). There are two varieties that are pathogenic to humans, var. duboisii and var. capsulatum. The former exists only in Africa, while var. capsulatum is most prevalent in regions of North, Central, and South America, but has also been reported from parts of Africa, Southern and Eastern Europe, Eastern Asia, and Australia (Cottle et al. 2013). It grows as a mold in soil enriched with bird or bat guano; human infection occurs after inhalation of the dust generated when such soil is disturbed. Visiting caves, collecting or being exposed to bat guano are the main sources of human contamination from bats (CDC 2012; Cottle et al. 2013; Hoar et al. 1998; J\u00fclg et al. 2008; Kajfasz and Basiak 2012; Schwarz and Kauffman 1977). The threat of Histoplasma capsulatum infection in bat-inhabited caves should be emphasized to travelers and also to physicians (Kajfasz and Basiak 2012). Bats usually are healthy carriers and shed the fungus in their feces. In humans, clinical manifestations in humans vary according to host immunity and exposure intensity, ranging from asymptomatic infection (in most healthy persons exposed to a low inoculum; about 80 % of the time) to life-threatening pneumonia with respiratory failure (Cottle et al. 2013; Hoar et al 1998). Between these extremes, clinical presentations include acute or subacute pulmonary disease, pericarditis, rheumatological syndromes with erythema nodosum, progressive disseminated disease, and mediastinal complications. Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in returning travelers typically presents as a flu-like illness with high-grade fever, chills, headache, nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and fatigue. Chest radiographs often show diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Symptom onset is usually 1\u20133 weeks following exposure and most individuals recover spontaneously within 3 weeks. Disseminated disease is a rare complication, more likely to occur in persons with severely impaired cellular immunity (Cottle et al. 2013). The African species, H. capsulatum var duboisii, is associated with cutaneous lesions and occasionally infection of long bones (Hoar et al. 1998).",

Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic disease caused by Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii spp., which are predominant in arid zones of the American continent, mainly in the Southwestern United States and the northern states of Mexico, as well as other regions with different environmental conditions (Welsh et al. 2012). Some countries of Central and South America are also endemic zones. Most infected patients are asymptomatic. Disseminated disease develops in less than 5 % of clinically affected individuals. Culture, biopsy, and DNA probes are used for fungus identification. Prognosis is related to low antibody detection and a positive intradermic skin reaction to coccidioidin. Immunosuppressed patients and pregnant women require special attention in diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. Amphotericin B in its different forms, itraconazole, and fluconazole, are the most frequently used treatments. Both fungi have been detected in bats and bat guano (Krutzsch and Watson 1978; Cordeiro et al. 2012). In Brazil, Coccidioides posadasii was recovered from Carollia perspicillata bat lungs (Cordeiro et al. 2012).
