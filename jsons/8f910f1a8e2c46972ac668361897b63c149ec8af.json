Comparison of the protein profiles of Golgienriched fractions of cells that were either mock infected or infected with mouse hepatitis virus revealed the significant depletion or enrichment of 116 proteins. Although ribosomal/nucleic acid binding proteins were enriched in the Golgi-fractions of mouse hepatitis virus-infected cells, proteins annotated to localize to several organelles of the secretory pathway were overrepresented among the proteins that were depleted from these fractions upon infection. We hypothesized that proteins, of which the abundance or distribution is affected by infection, are likely to be involved in the virus life cycle. Indeed, depletion of a small subset of the affected proteins by using small interfering RNAs identified several host factors involved in coronavirus infection. Transfection of small interfering RNAs targeting either C11orf59 or Golgi apparatus glycoprotein 1 resulted in increased virus replication, whereas depletion of vesicle-trafficking protein vesicle-trafficking protein sec22b enhanced the release of infectious progeny virus. Overexpression of these proteins, on the other hand, had a negative effect on virus replication.

CoVs were brought to the centre of attention by the appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) [8] . These viruses contain a very large RNA genome (around 30 kb), the first two-thirds of which code for the proteins involved in replication and transcription of the viral RNA. The other third of the genome codes among others for the structural proteins that build up the coronavirion. All CoVs contain a common set of structural proteins, consisting of the nucleocapsid (N), the spike (S), the membrane (M) and the envelope (E) protein [9, 10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 447, "end": 450, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 887, "end": 890, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 891, "end": 894, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "During their life cycle, CoVs interact with the host cell secretory pathway in several ways. In infected cells, CoVs induce the formation of a network of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes to which the viral replication-transcription complexes are anchored [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The host cell pathways involved in the assembly of the DMV-anchored replication-transcription complexes are not known. However, CoV replication and the secretory pathway were shown to be closely connected as CoV RNA replication was severely affected when ER-to-Golgi transport was interfered by the addition of drugs, by the expression of dominant-negative mutants or by the depletion of host proteins using RNA interference [6, 16, 17] . Also during assembly of progeny virus, the CoV life cycle and the secretory pathway are intertwined. CoV morphogenesis predominantly takes place at the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment. The ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment membranes are modified by viral glycoproteins thereby facilitating the budding of the nucleocapsid through these membranes, resulting in the assembly of progeny virus. The CoV M protein is the most important viral protein for the budding process. It is considered the building brick of the coronavirion as it interacts with all other virion components [18] . The M protein localizes to the budding compartment, but it is also abundantly present in the Golgi apparatus beyond the site of budding [19] [20] [21] [22] . After assembly, the coronavirions are subject to an intracellular postbudding maturation step that occurs while trafficking through the Golgi apparatus [23] . It thus appears that the host cell secretory pathway, including the Golgi apparatus, plays an essential role in the CoV life cycle, although the exact molecular mechanisms are not yet clear.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 283, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 284, "end": 288, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 289, "end": 293, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 294, "end": 298, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 299, "end": 303, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 731, "end": 734, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 735, "end": 738, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 739, "end": 742, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1332, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1475, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1480, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1485, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1490, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1645, "end": 1649, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this study, we used a quantitative proteomic approach with the aim to identify host cell proteins that are involved in CoV replication.

Here, we focused our efforts on the secretory pathway, which plays an important role in the CoV life cycle as detailed above. To diminish the complexity of the samples and because of the known importance of the Golgi apparatus in CoV infection, we investigated changes in protein composition of an isolated Golgi-enriched fraction from cells infected with the prototype mouse hepatitis CoV (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)). To this end, SILAC was used for in vivo incorporation of stable isotopes into proteins for MS-based quantitative proteomics [24] . With this approach, we were able to identify 116 proteins that were significantly changed in their abundance in the Golgi-enriched fraction upon MHV infection.

Seventy-two hours post-transfection, the cells were infected with MHV expressing a luciferase gene. MHV replication, production and release of infectious progeny virus were assessed by measuring luciferase expression as schematically shown in Fig. 5B and described in Section 2. MHV replication was assessed by measuring the intracellular luciferase values in the interfered and infected cells, at 12 h p.i. The level of luciferase protein expression has been previously shown to correspond to the level of MHV replication in the cells [16, 26] . The production and release of progeny virus was studied by inoculating fresh (non-interfered) HeLa-CEACAM1a cells with the cell culture supernatants of the interfered and infected cells. The level of luciferase in these cells is a measure for the number of secreted infectious MHV virions. Figure 5C shows the relative luciferase expression levels, represented as the luciferase activity expressed relative to cells treated with siRNAs targeting GFP after correction for the cell viability. The data show that depletion of the protein C11orf59 and GLG1 resulted in a significantly increased luciferase expression, whereas cell viability was not affected, suggesting a role for C11orf59 and GLG1 in MHV replication.

To investigate to what extent depletion of the selected proteins affected the secretory pathway per se, thereby possibly affecting MHV replication and release of infectious progeny virus, secretion of Gaussia luciferase was assessed after siRNA treatment of the cells. Figure 6 shows that secretion of Gaussia luciferase was not significantly affected after depletion of the selected proteins.

Although the depletion (2.2-fold) of this protein from the isolated fraction upon infection may indicate that it is recruited to the sites of viral RNA synthesis, this could not be confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Alternatively, the degradation of this protein may be enhanced upon infection. C11orf59 was shown to have multiple functions [53] [54] [55] [56] .
