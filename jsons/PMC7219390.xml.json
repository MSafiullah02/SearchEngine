After a week of investigations, the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was found as the etiologic factor (1). The virus was a mutated form of Coronaviridae family, which similar to many other respiratory viruses, was comprised of a RNA component covered by viral capsid protein, but acquired a novel genomic mutation, making it resistant to standard medications (2). Highly contagious with droplets and contact transmission, the virus might stay silent for a period of 2.4\u201315.5 d (3) and then manifests with flu-like symptoms, non-suppurative coughs, fever, diarrhea, myalgia, or even anosmia in some cases. The lungs will be the next victims and in severe cases, after a course of 1\u20132 weeks, the patients would die due to acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

It almost took 1.5 month that the outbreak was controlled in China, with a primary increasing trend, steep slope, and then the downtrend. This demonstrates not only the normal trend of an infectious outbreak, but also the role of human interventions to control it. Considering the crowded population of China, health-care preventive and therapeutic interventions were important in restricting the extent of outbreak, as if the natural history of outbreak would have been passed, much more affected patients and deaths were the result.",

While struggling in the life-and-death battle of COVID-19 outbreak in China, the other countries, were almost in peace, until the second half of February. Interestingly, the beginning of uptrend in other countries was almost simultaneous with beginning of the downtrend in China. This can further be explained by the role of incubation period in estimating the true prevalence of this disease; as although many of the patients were affected in other countries, they were asymptomatic carriers in the incubation period, who could silently infect many others. Therefore, the steep slope of the curves was created when the fist incubation periods were finished.",

Therefore, no matter to which cause, the outbreaks might be inevitable to occur sometimes; but, more important to be considered, is how we approach them to be defined and controlled. First, it should be taken to account that even though some countries, especially the developing ones, might not be marked on the leading board of affected countries, the probability of high prevalence shall not be ignored in them. This is important as low reports in such countries could be a result of inadequate diagnostic tests rather than low prevalence. Second, the approach to control a pandemic would make more sense in case of international collaborations in the matters of disease prevention and treatment. While preventive approaches such as restricting transportation or preventive equipment may be the first lines, research investigations for developing specific medication and vaccines come as the second line of encountering an outbreak.",
