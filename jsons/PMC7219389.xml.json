            "text": "The management of patients with chronic neurological diseases who receive immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications has become more challenging during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most patients with multiple sclerosis are on long-term DMTs. They are concerned that their underlying illness or their medications may increase the risk of infection with the novel coronavirus or experiencing a more severe or fatal disease. In fact, respiratory tract infections are generally more common in MS, and their incidence increases with age, level of disability, and male sex (Wijnands et al., 2017). Influenza-related hospitalizations and mortality are also significantly higher in patients with MS (Nelson et al., 2015). Additionally, DMTs, depending on their mechanisms of action, may increase the risk of infections (Luna et al., 2019; Williamson and Berger, 2015; Winkelmann et al., 2016).",

Although, there is a 79% nucleotide similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and previously recognized SARS-Cov-1, the etiology of SARS outbreak in 2002\u20132003, SARS-CoV-2 has higher infectivity and transmissibility in human and can manifest as severe pneumonia or life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (Huang et al., 2020; Zhang and Holmes, 2020). Several lines of investigation suggest that intense innate immune response and lack of enough adaptive immunity may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease, and the release of a large number of inflammatory cytokines may result in a poor prognosis (Cao, 2020). For these reasons, a variety of immunomodulatory medications have been proposed as potential treatments for complications of COVID-19 and are currently being tested in clinical trials (Stebbing et al., 2020). So far, there have been a few case reports or case series reporting on the risk and course of COVID-19 in patients with MS (Borriello G, 2020; Quinti et al., 2020; Sormani, 2020). However, we still do not know the association of demographic features, disability level, or various DMTs with the risk of this infection.",

Because the prior reports of an association between B-cell depleting antibodies (Luna et al., 2019), fingolimod (Cohen et al., 2010)and natalizumab (Polman et al., 2006) with increased risk of infections, we categorized the DMTs into four groups: B-cell depleting antibodies (rituximab and ocrelizumab), immune-cell trafficking inhibitors (fingolimod and natalizumab), other DMTs (including glatiramer acetate, interferons, dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide) and no DMT group. There were no patients on other lymphocyte-depleting DMTs, such as alemtuzumab or cladribine. To determine if any variable was independently associated with the COVID-19-suspect status, we fit a multivariable Poisson regression model with robust error variance with the COVID-19-suspect status as the dependent variable and the following variables as predictors: age, sex, MS type, disease duration, PDDS category, the level of compliance with \"stay at home recommendations,\" report of recent contact with a person with respiratory symptoms, report of a recent contact a patient with COVID-19 diagnosis, and DMT category (categorized as B-cell depleting antibodies, immune-cell trafficking inhibitors, other DMTs, and no DMT).

The good outcome in MS patients contracted with COVID-19 is also supported by a report of the Italian study group on COVID-19 in MS patients (Sormani, 2020). The patients with MS in our study were relatively young, and the observed favorable outcomes are consistent the reported good outcomes in young, otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients. These findings might be reassuring, but the selection bias inherent in survey studies may underly this observation. Patients with more severe disease (for example, those who were still in a hospital or an ICU) were less likely to respond to the survey. This may lead to an incorrect conclusion of a more benign course of the disease in MS. On the other hand, symptomatic people were more motivated to participate in the survey (or asymptomatic patients were less likely to participate). This selection bias could lead to finding a higher proportion of the disease-suspects when compared to the general population.",

The only two patients who needed hospitalizations were on a B-cell depleting antibody. However, all MS patients on B cell depleting agents suspected for COVID-19 were eventually recovered. This finding is also supported by other groups who studied the course of COVID-19 in patients with MS (Quinti et al., 2020; Sormani, 2020).",

However, they remove a large portion (or all) of circulating B-cells and impair the humoral arm of the immune system and increase the risk of Infections (Luna et al., 2019). Recent studies on immune response against SARS-C0V-2 infection reiterate the fact that intact adaptive immune response and generation of neutralizing antibody against the virus play protective roles in the host during the symptomatic period and less severe phase of the disease (Shi et al., 2020). Therefore, patients with MS treated with B-cell depleting agents might be more prone to COVID19. In fact, patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) who suffers from lack of B-cells showed full recovery following COVID-19 infection, implying that neutralizing antibody might be less crucial in the later phase of infection and its recovery (Quinti et al., 2020; Soresina et al., 2020). However, XLA patients receive therapeutic IVIG intermittently that may contribute to their recovery from COVID-19.",

In that case, the differences were driven by the patients receiving interferons and DMF: Among patients on interferons or DMF, the proportion of patients in the COVID-19 group was smaller than the non-COVID-19 group. Antiviral properties of type I interferons that may subside SARS-COV-2 infection (Barrat et al., 2019) could be relevant to this finding. Patients on DMF have less inflammatory T-cell responses (Najjar et al., 2020). It has been shown that a strong virus-specific T-cell response could lead to more severe disease in another coronavirus respiratory disease (SARS-Cov-1 infection) (Prompetchara et al., 2020).The Italian preliminary data also demonstrate that patients who were on DMF recover well from COVID-19 (Sormani, 2020). We did not observe any differences in the proportion of fingolimod- and natalizumab-treated patients between the COVID-suspect group and the rest of participants. None of the patients who participated in the survey received other lymphocyte-depleting medications, such as alemtuzumab and cladribine. These findings are preliminary, the number of participants with the outcome (being in the COVID-19 group) was small, and these results should be interpreted with caution.",
