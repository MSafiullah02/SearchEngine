Recently, Taiwanese doctors created an \"aerosol box\" that has 3 openings-2 ports and 1 side, which restrict hand movements and patient positioning; is not feasible to use on emergent situations such as trauma, cardiopulmonary arrest, or a patient requiring emergent cesarean delivery; and has an accessibility with few limitations. 1 Although, Canelli et al 2 did not identify any leakage out of the aerosol box in their simulation.",

In our simulation, the anesthesiologist covered the head of an airway mannequin with this sheet before preoxygenation with a facemask that is connected to the artificial manual breathing unit through crosscut ( Figure B ). After induction of anesthesia, vocal cords are visualized either by a direct or video laryngoscope under the sheet ( Figure C) , and the endotracheal tube is passed through a marked crosscut in the sheet ( Figure D) . After successfully securing the endotracheal tube cuff, the instruments used are isolated to avoid contamination. We proposed to keep the patients head covered during extubation and, if feasible, during surgery.",
