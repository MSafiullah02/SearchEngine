To date, the exact mode of transmission is uncertain but it appears that human beings are vulnerable no matter their socio\u2010economic status, race, gender, age and geographic location. We can only imagine the state of AIDS care or malaria care if these diseases had had the same status and level of collaboration that SARS has had. There is, however, some reason to be optimistic on this front. Mitka (2001) described a report issued by the Council on Foreign Relations and Milbank Memorial Fund arguing that United States of America (USA) foreign policy must consider the health of the people of the world for the following reasons. The USA is at increased risk from infectious diseases that know no borders, developing countries receive 42% of USA exports and poor health is known to create \u2018political instability, disenfranchises people with inadequate social capital, limits economic growth and exacerbates the human damage caused by social and economic dislocation\u2019 (p. 1165).",

Such actions could be referred to as \u2018strategic actions reframing systems\u2019 (SARS). The following strategies will be used in order to promote an upstream health care discourse: (a) The Dixon and Dixon (2002) integrative model of environmental health is presented as an organizing framework and contrasted with the public health model; (b) SARS and the Toronto experience in particular are examined using the Dixon and Dixon model, as well as other readings; (c) the results of the Toronto experience are interpreted in relation to the model and to upstream thinking and finally; (d) nursing research strategies that can reframe existing disease control discourses are presented.",

The rather narrow view of the environment and the patient that nurses and other health care professionals have learned may perhaps be serving to drive health care professionals to consider only the immediate environment of the patient.

(1999), it fails in its persistent focus on individual risk behaviours, and its dismissal of hazards that lie beyond personal choice, leading to failure to examine public health problems from the wider perspective of the global environment and the societies in which risk behaviours take place. Once risks are identified, public health departments have a good record on preventing and reducing risk through education. Public health departments control health problems using the results of epidemiological studies. For example, following discovery of the relationship between cigarette smoking and coronary heart disease and between injuries and automobile seatbelts, public health departments were instrumental in developing educational programmes on smoking cessation and the use of seatbelts (Mann et al. 1999). This work, although valuable, is still a response to what has already happened and brings us to where Dixon and Dixon (2002) want to go: what combination of factors has the potential to lead to a problem, and what can be done upstream so the world is not dealing with emerging diseases like SARS?",

Toronto suddenly found itself with many sick people; therefore, physicians and nurses and other health care providers took care of the sick. Hospitals closed their doors to visitors and stopped elective surgery in order to prevent disease transmission. Thousands of people were quarantined to prevent community transmission. Scientists were busy working on a vaccine. Politicians were busy doing damage control and defending public policy. As soon as the first wave of SARS appeared to be contained, Toronto infectious disease specialists began travelling internationally to describe their treatment and containment of SARS. Meanwhile, the disease continued to simmer at home (Abraham & Priest 2003a). Following the immediate reactions, criticism of provincial public health policy and hospital policy began to appear. Physicians criticized the lack of a provincial microbiology laboratory and a communication system (Abraham & Priest 2003b). Nurses criticized the reduced employment of full\u2010time nurses (Grinspun 2003), and the fact that they were not being listened to when they knew the second wave of SARS was breaking out (Galloway 2003a).

In order to interrupt the disease discourse that focuses on the individual and to open a discourse that makes visible the social constructedness of disease, Butterfield proposes for nurses an upstream perspective that elaborates nursing actions that are distributive and strategic. Distributive actions are those activities that nurses carry out on a day\u2010to\u2010day basis to incorporate environmental thinking into their work. They could include asking questions about the environment when interviewing clients, and working to alter the ways in which we carry out daily activities to include an environmental perspective. Distributive actions amount to vigilance toward ongoing threats in the environment. Nurses and physicians who specialize in infectious disease treatment have a unique opportunity to be upstream, and to scan the macro environment for precursors of disease and advocate societal strategies to reduce them.",

            "text": "Strategic actions, on the other hand, concern discovery and new knowledge. They come through research and making a conscious effort to know and understand as much as possible about chemicals, pesticides, population growth, soil erosion, disappearance of birds and languages, killing forests, water contamination, climate destabilization, increasing urban populations, global tourism, migration, social disruption from wars and disease emergence (Worldwatch Institute 2001, 2003a, 2003b). This new knowledge will enable for nurses and others to develop upstream discourses, although they are often caught downstream caring for the victims of diseases like SARS. Toronto, Canada and the world now have an opportunity to move their actions upstream, but first they need to see how they contribute to the social construction of phenomena in particular diseases. The social construction of phenomena referred to by Butterfield is a common thread in the work of several contemporary authors from different disciplines. For example, Kleinman et al. (1997), Mann et al. (1999) and Friedman (1999) clearly saw the social connectedness from the perspectives of suffering, human rights and economics, respectively. The WHO operates within a public health model and therefore continues to focus on individual risk behaviours. It represents the public health voices of many countries and needs to examine public health problems from the wider perspective of the global environment in which risk behaviours happen. Upstream voices are needed in places like WHO that can alter discourses. Two such voices are those of nurses and nursing research that is strategic.",

            "text": "Nursing research that moves thinking about disease upstream is essential. Butterfield (2002) suggested that nurses should get involved in research to examine \u2018proposed etiologic links between environmental agents and the development of diseases such as Parkinson's and asthma\u2019 (p. 44). In addition, nurses need to demonstrate how poverty, disease and violence are linked to environmental devastation. They need to know how the public views the environment in which they live, to find out what environmental concerns citizens have and to initiate needed research or implement existing research. Engagement of participants locally ensures that what is needed is addressed, and local success can be projected nationally and internationally (Kleinman et al. 1997, Friedman 1999). Through local connectedness nurses will know what illnesses are prevalent in their communities, and with comprehensive environmental knowledge can develop strong hunches about links between the two. They can be vital in reporting diseases with known and/or suspected environmental links. Tracking these diseases will lead to research confirming environmental links. Knowledge of these links is necessary in working to modify economic and political policy that induces and perpetuates environmental destruction resulting in poor health. Preservation of the environment has the potential to interrupt the development of further diseases. Nurses can play all of the roles from principal investigator in nationally funded studies, to instrument developer, to data collector, to organizing collaborative efforts for multi\u2010site studies and identifying to researchers studies that need to be done.",

Global, national and institutional ethnographies in situations of economic collapse, where poverty, inequality and violation of human rights are the norm, would be instructional in identifying how ethnic conflict comes to be. The testing of existing and emerging models associated with the environment, such as the ecological model and the integrative model of environmental health, will also serve to move thinking upstream.",
