            "text": "Coronaviruses can be classified into 4 genera (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4) and these viruses are detected in a wide range of animal species, including humans (1). There are 6 previously known human coronaviruses that can be transmitted between humans. Human alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, are common respiratory viruses usually causing mild upper respiratory diseases. In contrast to these, the other 2 human beta-coronaviruses, SARS and MERS coronaviruses, are highly pathogenic in humans. The case fatality rates of SARS and MERS are about 10% and 35%, respectively (2, 3). SARS and MERS can be transmitted between humans and may cause major outbreaks in health care settings or in community settings. Both SARS and MERS coronaviruses are of zoonotic origins. MERS coronavirus is widely circulated in dromedary camels. Over 90% of dromedary camels in Middle East countries are seropositive for MERS coronavirus (4, 5). Because of such a high prevalence in this animal species, sporadic zoonotic transmissions of MERS coronavirus from camels to humans have been repeatedly detected in the affected region since its discovery in 2012. For the SARS outbreak in 2003, exotic mammals in wet markets, such as palm civets and raccoon dogs, are believed to be the animal sources of the virus (6). The detection of SARS coronavirus in these species led to a temporary ban of selling of these animals in 2004, thereby preventing additional spill-over events from animals to humans. But further surveillance studies indicated that these animals are rarely positive for SARS coronavirus in non-market settings, suggesting that they only served as intermediate hosts in the SARS event (1, 7). Subsequent virus surveillances in wild animals identified a vast number of coronaviruses in bats (8). Interestingly, several bat coronaviruses that are genetically similar to human SARS coronavirus were detected in horseshoe bats. This group of SARS-like bat coronaviruses, together with SARS coronavirus, form a unique clade under the subgenus Sarbecovirus. It is now generally believed that SARS coronavirus is a recombinant virus between several bat SARS-like beta-coronaviruses (9). Some of these bat coronaviruses are experimentally capable of infecting human cells in cultures (9), suggesting that these animal viruses and their recombinants can pose threats to human health.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia patients epidemiologically linked to a wholesale market in Wuhan was detected (10). A novel beta-coronavirus named as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been identified in some of these patients. This virus is genetically similar to a bat virus in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (11). As of 22 January 2020, over 200 cases, including 4 fatal ones, have been detected in Wuhan and other provinces (12). In addition, confirmed patients with a recent travel history to Wuhan have been detected in multiple countries (Japan: 1, South Korea: 1, USA: 1, and Thailand: 2). Some of the confirmed cases have no epidemiological link to wet markets, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human transmissions and/or multiple spill-over events in different settings. At the time of preparing this article, a hospital outbreak had been reported (13). The spectrum of this disease in humans is yet to be fully determined. Signs of infection are highly nonspecific, and these include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, and viral pneumonia. Thus, diagnostic tests specific for this infection are urgently needed for confirming suspected cases, screening patients and conducting virus surveillance.",

The downloaded sequence and those for SARS coronavirus, bat SARS-like coronaviruses, and other representative coronaviruses were edited and aligned. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences were performed using the neighbor joining method in MEGA X (14). Two sequence regions (ORF1b and N) that are highly conserved amongst sarbecoviruses were selected for primer and probe designs. The primer and probe sequences for the ORF1b gene assay are: 5\u2019-TGGGGYTTTACRGGTAACCT-3\u2019 (Forward; Y = C/T, R = A/G), 5\u2019-AACRCGCTTAACAAAGCACTC-3\u2019 (Reverse; R = A/G) and 5\u2032-TAGTTGTGATGCWATCATGACTAG-3\u2032 (Probe in 5\u2019-FAM/ZEN/3\u2019-IBFQ format; W = A/T), whereas the primer and probe sequences for the N gene assay are: 5\u2032-TAATCAGACAAGGAACTGATTA-3\u2032 (Forward), 5\u2032-CGAAGGTGTGACTTCCATG-3\u2032 (Reverse) and 5\u2032-GCAAATTGTGCAATTTGCGG-3\u2032 (Probe in 5\u2019-FAM/ZEN/3\u2019-IBFQ format). The expected amplicon sizes of ORF1b and N gene assays are 132 bp and 110 bp, respectively. All primers and probes were purchased from a commercial source (Integrated DNA Technologies). The primer and probe sequences were subsequently confirmed to have perfect matches with other 2019-nCoV genome sequences available from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID; https://www.gisaid.org/; Accession numbers: EPI_ISL_402119, EPI_ISL_402120, EPI_ISL_402121, EPI_ISL_402123 and EPI_ISL_402124; Accessed 12 Jan 2020).",

Using additional sequence information from this clade of coronaviruses, we selected highly conserved ORF1b and N gene regions as our targets (Fig. 1B). These designs allow the use of nucleic acids derived from SARS coronavirus as positive controls.",

In 2003, SARS coronaviruses found in palm civets and humans were genetically highly similar, but distinct. For example, a partial deletion was detected in SARS coronavirus found in palm civets (6). Similar subtle sequence variations were also observed in MERS coronavirus found in camels and humans (15).

The tested clinical samples were different in nature (sputum vs. throat swab) and they were collected at different onset times (day 5 vs. day 3). Thus, it is premature to use these data to determine the viral replication kinetics in humans. Further systematic investigations on clinical specimens collected from 2019-nCoV-infected patients at different post-onset time points will be needed. Nonetheless, the results demonstrated the clinical value of these respiratory samples for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV. In addition, the N gene RT-PCR assay was found to be more sensitive in detecting 2019-nCoV RNA in the studied clinical samples. It is possible that these clinical samples might contain infected cells expressing subgenomic mRNA (16), resulting in more N gene copies in the samples.",

Based on their detection performances, the N gene RT-PCR is recommended as a screening assay, and the Orf1b assay is recommended as a confirmatory one. Using a diagnostic algorithm similar to MERS, an N gene positive/Orf1b negative result should be regarded as indeterminate and the case is recommended to be referred to a WHO reference lab for further testing (18).
