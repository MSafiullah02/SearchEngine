The active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro contains Cys145 and His41, constituting a catalytic dyad in which cysteine functions as the common nucleophile in the proteolytic process.6 Untill now, all of the inhibitor studies have focused on the SARS-CoV 3CLpro and have utilized both synthetic peptidyl libraries and naturally derived libraries. Examples of the peptide-derive inhibitors include C2-symmetric diols,7 quinolinecarboxylic acids,8 and anilides,9 and the naturally derived inhibitors include quinone-methide triterpens,10 and biflavonoids amentoflavone,11 which are included in our screen of natural products with activity against 3CLpro. In contrast, structural and functional studies focused on PLpro are far less numerous but have established important roles for PLpro beyond viral peptide cleavage, including deubiquitination, deISGylation, and involvement in virus evasion of the innate response.12 It is located on polypeptide 1a and undergoes self-cleavage at three sites on the polypeptide. Its catalytic triad (Cys1651-His1812-Asp1826) has a broad range of optimum pH values, characteristic of papain-like cysteine protease.12, 13 To date, only a small number of inhibitors of PLpro have been studied, including molecules identified from high-throughput screening, such as thiopurine analogs,14 benzamide derivatives,15 and the noncovelent inhibitor GRL0617.16 Despite numerous biochemical, strucutral, and inhibitor-development studies directed at 3CLpro and PLpro, potent antiviral that directly target proteases have yet to be developed.",

The inhibitors were screened against the proteases using a fluorescent peptide substrate, and the steady-state inhibition parameters of the effective inhibitors were evaluated. The mode of action of the inhibitors was further investigated with a kinetic assay and the function of time exposed to the inhibitors. To our knowledge, this structure is the first to show SARS coronaviral cysteine proteases (3CLpro and PLpro) and deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme activities.

Ultimately, our goal is to develop a naturally derived SARS viral cysteine protease inhibitor for use as an anti-SARS drug. As a first step toward this goal, we expressed SARS-CoV 3CLpro in E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL cells, purified the protein to homogeneity, and evaluated a FRET-based peptide cleavage assay to measure the kinetic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The purification consisted of a combination of hydrophobic interaction and anion exchange chromatography and resulted in a purified single protein with a weight of approximately 33 kDa. The peptide substrate utilized was KNSTLQSGLRKE labelled with Dabcyl and Edans. We also expressed and purified SARS-CoV PLpro (36 kDa) from E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL. PLpro, located within nsp3, cleaves at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3 and nsp3/4 boundaries using the consensus motif LXGG. Therefore, to identify potential inhibitors of PLpro, we used a sensitive fluorescence screen developed during our initial work, which used a commercially available peptide substrate to represent the C-terminal residues of LXGG with a C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) fluorogenic reporter group. In this study, the SARS-CoV cysteine proteases\u2019 inhibitory activity was evaluated with the above expressed proteins and substrates following the general procedure previously described.11, 16 The inhibition of proteases slowly increased with increasing concentrations of the corresponding compounds. The IC50 value of the compounds, which expresses their ability to inhibit the catalytic activity of the protease, was calculated by fitting the dose\u2013response curve to a logistic derivative equation.",

            "text": "The isolated tanshinones (1\u20137) were evaluated in-house for their SARS-CoV 3CLpro and PLpro inhibitory activities, which in turn allowed us to develop a new class inhibitor with increased selectivity. The results of the inhibition studies of both proteases are expresses as IC50 values and are reported in Table 1\n. First, the inhibitory potencies and capacities of these tanshinones toward SARS-CoV 3CLpro were investigated. The SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activity was assayed by following the proteolysis of the fluorogenic substrate in the presence or absence of the test compounds, as described in our previous studies.11 As shown in Table 1, all isolated tanshinones examined, apart from cryptotanshinone (4), exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on 3CLpro (Fig. 2\nA); however, the compounds did not have time-dependent inhibition profiles. No improved inhibitory activity was observed after preincubation of the inhibitors with 3CLpro. Salvianolic acid B, a representative bioactive compound in the hydrophilic fraction, did not show a significant inhibitory effect (30% at 200 \u03bcM). We found that the activity of these compounds ranged from 14.4 to 89.1 \u03bcM against 3CLpro. Importantly, dihydrotanshinone I (6) showed extremely high inhibition with an IC50 value of 14.4 \u03bcM. In addition, the activity was slightly affected by subtle changes in structure. To identify the active inhibitory pharmacophore, a structure\u2013function relationship study was carried out. Initially, the presence of naphthalene in the diterpene quinolone backbone appeared to be important for activity in comparison to the presence of dimethyl tetranaphthalene. For example, 1 and 4 contain dimethyl tetranaphthalene and have IC50 values of 89.1 and 226.7 \u03bcM, respectively, while 5 and 6 contain naphthalene and showed IC50 values of 38.7 and 14.4 \u03bcM. Subsequently, when we compared a series of tanshinone II analogs (1\u20134), we found that the introduction of a dihydrofuran moiety on the A-ring to this group (4) decreases the inhibitory activity \u223c2-fold, which is in contrast to the results obtained with inhibitors 1\u20133 that have furan moiety. The hydroxymethyl group on the D-ring derivative 2 exhibited improvement of enzyme inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 24.8 \u03bcM. The corresponding methyl ester on the D-ring of derivative 3 also showed a similar potency enhancement (IC50\n = 21.1 \u03bcM). In contrast, the dihydrofuran moiety of tanshinone I (6, IC50\n = 14.4 \u03bcM) turned out to be more potent than furan (5, IC50\n = 38.7 \u03bcM) within the series of tanshinone I analogs (5 and 6).",

The initial rates were calculated from the first 5 min of the progress curves. Interestingly, all of the isolated compounds showed a time-dependent inhibitory effect on PLpro activity, which is the first report of naturally derived inhibitors of PLpro. As can be observed from the data presented in Table 1 and Figure 2B, when the isolated compounds from S. miltiorrhiza were preincubated for 60 min, they showed more inhibition than those without incubation. Most of these tanshinones show an increased inhibition of the enzymatic activity of PLpr\u00b0Compared to 3CLpro in the nanomolar or micromolar range. As evidenced from the PLpro inhibition, the dimethyl tetrahydronaphthalen structure showed a more potent inhibitory response than the naphthalene chymotype. Of the isolated tanshinones, cryptotanshinone (4) displayed the most potent inhibitory activity (IC50\n = 0.8 \u03bcM). By comparing the series of tanshinone II derivatives, it was shown that the furan moiety on the A-ring does not show improved inhibition with PLpro. This result was unexpected because of the increased inhibition of 3CLpro with 1 compared to that of 4. Tanshinone IIA (1, IC50\n = 1.6 \u03bcM) showed a two-fold lower inhibition effect than cryptotanshinone (4). Similar trends can also be observed with tanshinone I (5, IC50\n = 8.8 \u03bcM) and dihydrotanshinone I (6, IC50\n = 4.9 \u03bcM), which showed respectively similar inhibitory activities because they have similar A-ring structures. Other tanshinone II analogs 2 (IC50\n = 10.7 \u03bcM) and 3 (IC50\n = 9.2 \u03bcM) suggested that the presence of a hydroxymethyl and methyl ester on the D-ring has a weak effect on inhibition potency. Interestingly, the abietane analog, rosmariquinone (7), displayed significant activity against both SARS-CoV cysteine proteases with IC50 values of 21.1 and 30.0 \u03bcM. The abietane skeleton is structurally related to the tanshinones, and its activity is noteworthy, suggesting that further research on this important lead compound is needed.",

            "text": "To investigate the inhibition mechanism, the time dependence of the inhibition of the proteolysis of Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC (RLRGG-AMC) by these inhibitors was subsequently probed. Reaction progress curves in the presence of varied concentrations of the isolated tanshinones are illustrated. Taken as an ensemble, the residual enzyme activity decreases as a function PLpro/tanshinones incubation time in Figure 3\n. Representatively, compound 4 show a clear time- and concentration-dependent approach to the steady-state because it curves downwards, which is characteristic of slow-binding inhibition kinetics (Fig. 3A and Fig. S50). All of the PLpro inhibitors (1\u20137) manifested the same relationship for the enzyme activity. Slow-binding inhibition mechanisms can be investigated by preincubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor, followed by measurement of the initial velocities for substrate proteolysis as a function of preincubation time. Increasing the concentration of compound 4 led to a decrease in both the initial velocity (v\ni) and the steady-state rate (v\ns). The progress curves obtained using various concentrations of the inhibitors were fit to (Eq. 1) to determine v\ni, v\ns, and k\nobs. The plot represents the relationship between k\nobs and [I] for all possible inhibition modes (simple reversible slow-binding, enzyme isomerization, and mechanism-based inhibition) to determine which kinetic profile was at play. The kinetic parameters (k\n3, k\n4, k\n5, k\n6, and K\ni\napp) were derived from the plots by fitting the results (Table 2\n). The results of all the inhibitors were fit to the slow-binding (Eq. 2), illustrating a hyperbolic dependence of kobs on the concentration of PLpro by tanshinones except for rosmariquinone (7). Based on the above kinetic observations, we believed that the reaction undergoes the following kinetic mechanism (Fig. 3B and Fig. S51). The hyperbolic dependence observed with the inhibitors suggests that they inhibit PLpro by rapid formation of an enzyme complex (E\u00b7I), which slowly isomerizes to from a modified enzyme complex (E\u2217\u00b7I) (Fig. 4\n). This is expected to sustain an inhibitory process longer than conventional inhibitors because k\n5 is higher than k\n6. Interestingly, the only abietane-containing structure, rosmariquinone (7), found in the isolated compounds was shown to be time dependent because k\nobs exhibited a linear dependence on the inhibitor concentration as depicted in Figure 3C. Thus, this result proves that the abietane type compound 7 from S. miltiorrhiza inhibits SARS-CoV PLpro by the simple reversible slow-binding model according to the data yielded by the analysis by Eqs. (3), (4) as listed in Table 2. This conclusion suggests that the four-ringed inhibitors may have a different binding mode than the three-ringed inhibitor. Additionally, these compounds represent a new class of SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors and, to our knowledge, are the first naturally derived, potent and time-dependent inhibitors of this enzyme.",

The enzymatic activity was measured with a series of substrate concentrations and various inhibitor concentrations. The inhibition data were globally fit to all of the possible kinetic models. As a result of this kinetic analysis, we found that S. miltiorrhiza-derived proteases inhibitors could be divided into two classes based upon their mode of inhibition. These classes could also be divided on the basis of their structure for the targeted enzyme. The isolated tanshinones (1\u20133 and 5\u20137) exhibit noncompetitive inhibition characteristics toward 3CLpro (see Supplementary data Fig. S46 and Fig. S47). In case of PLpro kinetic plots, four-ringed tanshinones (1\u20136) also showed noncompetitive inhibition kinetics (see Supplementary data Fig. S48 and Fig. S49). The three-ringed compound 7 was the only exception to this rule. As illustrated representatively in Figure 5\nA, the inhibition kinetics analyzed by Dixon plots shows that compound 4 has a noncompetitive mechanism because the Dixon plot of [I] versus 1/V results in a family of straight lines with the same x-axis intercept, as illustrated for the substrate concentrations. Compound 7 displayed mixed type inhibition against SARS-CoV PLpro, as shown in the Dixon plot (Fig. 5B). The Dixon plot of [I] versus 1/V resulted in a family of straight lines with an above the [I]-axis intercept. These kinetic mechanisms support the inferences drawn from the time-dependent assay, which reveals the important roles of the SARS-CoV PLpro inhibition modes. Notably, most slow-binding enzyme inhibitors act as competitive inhibitors, although it is possible for them to interact with the enzyme by competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive inhibitioin pattens. Despite having similar molecular size and functionality, the diterpene quinolone tanshinone derivatives, 1\u20136, inhibit the SARS-CoV PLpro isomerization slow-binding mode, whereas the abietane type derivative, 7, is active against PLpro through the simple slow-binding mode.",

To experimentally confirm the predicted DUB activity of the isolated cysteine protease inhibitors, we observed the DUB activity for in vitro characterization. Table 3\nlists the in vitro activity of compounds 1\u20137 against DUB. The IC50 values demonstrated that the presence of naphthalene in 5 (IC50\n = 0.7 \u03bcM) and 6 (IC50\n = 1.2 \u03bcM) provide a greater inhibitory effect than the other tanshinone derivatives. Although compound 4 was reported to be a potent inhibitor for SARS-CoV PLpro, 4 exhibited only a moderate inhibition effect against DUB activity (IC50\n = 87.6 \u03bcM). To date, there is no potent and selective chemical compound available for the inhibition of DUB. Hence, the biological consequence of inhibiting DUB is not clear at the moment. Moreover, the function of the DUB activity of PLpro in vivo is unknown, as is the identity of its in vivo cellular substrate.14 Thus, further investigation is necessary to determine the specifics of the inhibition with the tanshinones and the PLpro-DUB interaction. Other studies are needed to measure the cleavage of the ubiquitin-like protein, interferon (IFN)-induced 15 kDa protein (ISG15), from an ISG15-fusion protein, suggesting de-ISGylation by PLpro as a mechanism by which SARS-CoV inactivates an IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced innate immune response.22 Subsequently, compounds 1\u20137 were also evaluated against various proteases to study their selectivity and no detectable inhibition of any of the other proteases tested was observed (Table 3). Nevertheless, no detectable inhibition was observed at that concentration, indicating that tanshinones have an interesting selectivity for the viral proteases and could prove to be a viable lead for these proteolytic enzymes. Currently, there are many reports of rational designs and library-based screens that have identified several small molecules that act as potent inhibitors of the replication of SARS-CoV but are also HIV protease inhibitors. In contrast to this, our tanshinones-based viral protease inhibitors did not show a significant HIV protease inhibition effect.",

In this study, we focused on naturally derived tanshinones for inhibitory activity against both proteases. These compounds are abundant in the lipophilic fraction of S. miltiorrhiza extract. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the inhibitory effects of tanshinone against SARS-CoV main proteases. All of the isolated compounds 1\u20137 showed marked inhibitory activities to the 3CLpro and PLpro. The activity was significantly affected by subtle changes in structure. The IC50 values of these inhibitors, although higher than those of peptide-derived and small molecule viral cysteine protease inhibitors, are nonetheless in the low micromolar range. In particular, seven compounds exerted significant PLpro inhibitory activity (range from 0.8 to 30.0 \u03bcM) and inhibition was improved preincubation with the PLpro. In addition, our detailed kinetic mechanism analysis of these species has unveiled that they all exhibit slow-binding inhibition with enzyme isomerisation and noncompetitive inhibitors with the exception of compound 7. Interestingly, the introduction of three-ringed abietane analog, 7, showed simple reversible slow-binding inhibitor and mixed-type inhibition. Furthermore, the potential usage and development of other novel inhibitors for PLpro and cellular deubitquitination enzyme (DUB) based on the isolated compounds is discussed in this study. Out of the tanshinones, tanshinone I (5) showed the most potent DUB activity with an IC50 value of 0.7 \u03bcM. The results from this study warrant further investigation to examine the effect to these natural products on the inhibition of SARS-CoV.

Papain in a solution of 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.2) was incubated with various concentrations of compounds for 5 min at 25 \u00b0C. Then, 20 mM BAPNA (N-\u03b1-benzoyl-dl-arginine-p-nitroanilide) was added, and the increase in absorbance at 410 nm with time was monitored. The HIV protease assay kits and HIV-1 protease were purchased from AnasPec Inc., USA. HIV-1 protease in assay buffer was pre-incubated with each compound for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. The solution was then mixed with the FRET substrate, and the fluorescence intensity was measured with time at Ex/Em = 490 nm/520 nm.",
