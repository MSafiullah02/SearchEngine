It is worth mentioning that the presence of a long-bone fracture is indicative of a high-energy trauma injury with a high ISS score, which could lead to major morbidity and mortality [33], same as pelvic and spinal fractures. The neurovascular examination of an injured limb is of high importance as well, though sometimes it is not enough, especially in explosion scenarios. In a study conducted on improvised explosive device (IED) casualties, the researchers found that among 25 % of the patients with a normal physical examination, angiography demonstrated a significant vascular injury and 18 % of them required surgery for it [54].",

Its use is being popularized worldwide and encouraging reports are published regarding the success rates with applying it. A large retrospective review of 229 open tibial fractures that were treated with either VAC system (72 %) or conventional dressings (28 %) and compared the infection rates was published recently [70]. The results showed a significantly lower rate of infection with the use of the VAC system (8.4 % versus 20.6 % in concordance). Our local experience is also extremely successful with the use of the VAC system and our protocol mandates that every traumatic soft tissue injury will be dressed with the VAC system at the end of the initial surgery of irrigation and debridement.",

The leading rule of \u201clife before limb\u201d should govern hence the fractures will be treated with a quick application of external fixators in order to minimize the operative time in the initial surgery [16]. Coupland stated that the external fixator enables the treatment of the soft tissue injury while maintaining relative stability of the fracture, thus allowing it to heal with the creation of callus tissue and sometimes with no need for an internal fixation procedure later on [64]. This method is applied by the American Army in all campaigns in the recent years [71, 72] and was also extensively used by the Israeli Army in the treatment of the earthquake casualties in Haiti in 2010. The Israeli Army\u2019s Field Hospital Unit treated over a thousand patients in 10 days, out of which 73 external fixators were applied for open fractures and femoral fractures [73].",

However, a more complicated issue is the mangled extremity. The decision whether to amputate the limb or try and save it is a complex and difficult decision which entails not only medical issues but also ethical and social ones. Throughout the years, there were many attempts to build a scoring system that will help with these decisions and maybe the most familiar is the Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) published by Helfet et al. in 1990 [75]. The scoring is given according to four clinical criteria: the extent of soft tissue injury, limb ischemia, hypotension state, and age; a scoring of 7 points and over was demonstrated to be predictive of an amputation. Although this system is easy to use and apply, it has many advocates, and eventually, the decision whether to save or amputate the limb should be a clinical one and has to be made on an individual basis. Other influencing elements have to be taken into account in the decision process, such as other injuries, the neurological status of the patient and the limb, and the vitality of the muscle tissues; plastic and vascular consultations are highly recommended [67].",
