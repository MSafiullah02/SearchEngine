This seems logical because such infections often present with cough and this will propel secretions into the air. However, it is apparent now that only small particles of <5 \u03bcm, known as aerosols, will result in airborne transmission potentially over longer distances because these particles can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods. Most lung infections result in droplet transmission whereby the larger particles from the cough are transmitted for <1 m and do not remain suspended in the air.",

Preferential airborne infections such as chicken pox and measles can be initiated through multiple routes, but predominately by aerosols. These three infections are the only ones classified as airborne in international guidelines including those of the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization (WHO).2, 3 Finally, opportunistic airborne infections typically transmit through other routes but under favourable conditions, especially when aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation are undertaken, transmission can occur; examples include influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This last category is generally not taken as airborne, since, in the routine care of the patients, only droplet and contact precautions are required.",

Still, there is a tendency to play safe and to consider all viral chest infections as possible airborne infections, and to include a wide range of procedures as aerosol-generating procedures. It is thus important to separate the facts from the myths, and this brief presentation deals with two key issues. The first is to establish whether viral infections such as SARS and influenza are airborne, and the second is to come up with a definitive list of aerosol-generating procedures. The evidence from systematic reviews on these issues is summarized by WHO.3\n",

Two reviews are concerned with the research conducted before 2008.6, 7 Many experimental studies have been reported, but as Brankston et al. rightly pointed out, these were done with artificial aerosols where <10% of the particles were larger than 8 \u03bcm whereas in natural coughing >99% are larger than 8 \u03bcm. Therefore they questioned whether these studies are relevant to the natural route of human transmission.6 There were outbreaks reported which Tellier considered as strong evidence for airborne transmission, but Brankston et al. argued that, in these reports, many confounders were not addressed and in none of these studies were the air exchange rates reported.6, 5 The most well-known evidence for airborne transmission was the outbreak in a stationary airplane with a non-functional ventilation system; however, an outbreak of similar size was reported in another stationary plane, but with a functional ventilation system.8, 9 The outbreaks in these planes could also have been related to the free movement of passengers when the planes were parked for several hours, and are not convincing evidence for or against airborne transmission.",

MacIntyre et al. then reported another study by the same centre in China that showed a significant difference (P = 0.024).13 However, this was for subjects presenting with clinical respiratory infections. When only those with positive viral culture results were compared, there was no significant difference (P = 0.4). On the other hand, there was a significant difference in rates of positive bacterial cultures (P = 0.02). As these bacteria are not known to be airborne, the interpretation of the results was rather complicated. This, together with the previous retraction of their first paper, suggests that further confirmation from other researchers is needed to resolve the issue.",

Eight studies were quoted in support of this in a review published by Tran et al.\n22 Recently, a study on influenza further confirmed that only bronchoscopy and intubation are actually aerosol-generating procedures.23\n",
