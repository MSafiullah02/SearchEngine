A number of recommenders [2, 3, 10, 11] have been proposed to help infer users\u2019 potential interests based on their heterogeneous implicit feedback (HIF). Taking e-commerce as an example, the recommenders mainly leverage users\u2019 historical behaviors of various types (e.g., view, click, add-to-cart, purchase) to help predict what product to purchase afterwards. In this scenario, purchase is the target behavior, which directly reflects users\u2019 preference towards products. In contrast, view, click, add-to-cart are auxiliary behaviors to indirectly suggest users\u2019 taste over products to some extent. Both target and auxiliary behaviors benefit for user preference inference, possibly with different degrees.",

To illustrate, Fig. 1(a) depicts real user behaviors on products in an e-commerce system (e.g. Amazon), where two essential characteristics are noted: (1) Temporal dynamics: users perform sequential behaviors over products with different orders, indicating different behavior patterns. For instance, Bob and Alice prefer add-to-cart before purchase, whilst Ella directly buys the \u2018Coat\u2019 after click without add-to-cart. (2) Repeated behaviors: users may perform certain behaviors several times over products, reflecting a reinforced preference to some degree. For example, Alice clicks twice to check details before she makes the purchase decision; Ella may be quite satisfied with the quality after purchasing the \u2018Coat\u2019 and directly buy another one for her friend.\n",

They, however, are not well investigated by existing HIF based studies: (1) most methods [1, 5, 11\u201314] directly ignore the temporal dynamics. They only model the influence of limited types of user behaviors (e.g., only view and purchase) via a weighted combination, which heavily restricts the generability of these methods; (2) although several approaches [2, 10] notice the temporal dynamics, they simply pre-define a hard rule to order various user behaviors, thus failing to capture the real temporal dynamics. For instance, they assume that add-to-cart must come before purchase and after click. In Fig. 1(b), all users share the same behavior pattern based on the hard rule: click\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\rightarrow $$\\end{document}\nadd-to-cart\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\rightarrow $$\\end{document}\npurchase regardless of what their real behaviors are; and (3) none of them considers the repeated user behaviors. They merely merge the duplicated user-item interactions by keeping the earliest one. In Fig. 1, click twice is only treated as click once for Alice.

Specifically, TDRB is composed of three modules, (1) Target Module employs outer product and a convolutional neural network to directly learn expressive and high-order user-item correlation (i.e., user preference over items) regarding to the target behavior (e.g., purchase); (2) Auxilary Module aims to assist target module in predicting user preference over items. It uses gated recurrent units to accurately model the temporal dynamics and repeated patterns of auxiliary behaviors that happen before its corresponding target behavior; and (3) Fusion Module devises three strategies (i.e., MLP [6], Attention mechanism [9] and Outer product) to seamlessly integrate both target and auxiliary behaviors for a more accurate user preference estimation.",

For example, Rendle et al. proposed BPRMF [15] to maximize the difference of user preference over items with and without target behavior. After that, many variants have been proposed based upon BPRMF, such as GBPR [11], ABPR [12] and eALS [5]. However, they all fail to fully exploit the HIF by taking into account target behaviors only. Later, some researchers attempted to employ auxiliary behaviors (e.g., view, click) in addition to target behavior for the performance-enhanced recommendation. For instance, Qiu et al. designed TBPR/BPRH [13, 14] to utilize purchase, view and like for trinity preference ranking. Ding et al. proposed VALS [1] by fusing purchase with view through manually pre-defined weights. GcBPR [3] resolved the data sparsity problem by generating target behavior from a linear regression of auxiliary behaviors. Yin et al. devised SPTF [18] to overcome the issue of heavy skewness of the interaction distribution w.r.t. different types of HIF. Nevertheless, these methods all ignore the temporal dynamics and repeated patterns of user behaviors for the recommendation. Furthermore, most of them only consider limited types of auxiliary behaviors, thus restricting their generability. Afterwards, Loni et al. proposed McBPR [10] to capture the temporal dynamics by a pre-defined hard rule (e.g., add-to-cart must occur before purchase and after click), as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Undoubtedly, the proposed hard rule cannot truly express the temporal dynamics and repeated user behaviors.",

Being capable of capturing the non-linearity of user-item interactions, they have been widely applied to the recommendation with HIF [6, 7]. Similar to conventional recommenders, early deep learning-based recommenders only model user preference with target behavior, such as NCF [6]. Soon afterwards, He et al. further designed ConvNCF [7] to use an outer product and convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn high-order correlations among user-item interactions. Later, some studies turn to fuse both target and auxiliary behaviors. Wen et al. [17] devised a neural framework to capture both linearity and non-linearity of heterogeneous behaviors through. Recently, Gao et al. developed a neural model named NTMR [2] encoding a hard rule-based order for heterogeneous user behaviors, that is, add-to-cart must appear before purchase and after view. All of these methods mentioned above, however, fail to model the temporal dynamics and repeated behavior for a high-quality recommendation.",

Auxiliary behaviors (i.e., view, click) could indirectly reflect user inclination, thus benefiting for a better recommendation. Hence, the auxiliary module mainly takes advantage of auxiliary behaviors for a more fine-grained user preference inference. Existing studies either ignore the temporal dynamics of auxiliary behaviors [1, 3, 13, 14], or pre-define a hard rule to order them [2, 10]. Besides, all of them overlook the repeated behaviors. To ease this issue, we consider to accommodate the real auxiliary behavior sequence \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$S_a(u,i)=\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots , a_s\\}$$\\end{document}, which can be obtained by removing the target behavior f from the segmented sequence S(u, i).

Similar trends can be observed on the performance comparison between the two deep learning-based recommenders: ConvNCF and NMTR.
