The patient reported that he suddenly developed convulsion with teeth clenching and limb shaking, when resting on a sofa on the day of initial presentation, and symptoms resolved spontaneously after a few seconds. But when he was trying to get up, he noticed a back pain and was unable to move his lower limbs. He sought medical attention at Wuhan Hanyang District Hospital and was hospitalized. Computed tomography (CT) of thoracolumbar spine showed burst fracture of the 12th thoracic vertebra and the compression fracture of 1st lumbar vertebral.

Cytokine storms have been reported on cytomegalovirus, hemophilic lymph histiocytosis, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and SARS-CoV-2. 12 Cytokine storm is an important etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure, and its concentration is also related to the severity and the prognosis of the disease. 5, 13 For example, IL-6 can inhibit regulatory T cells, triggering an acute immune pathological response. 14,15 A surgery can cause inflammatory reactions such as surgical stress and affect the immune system, which may indeed affect the progression of COVID-19. Therefore, we tried very best to avoid any risk after surgery. Regarding the stable signs of the patient, we mainly focused on radiographic and laboratory tests, such as lung computed tomography (CT), white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, etc. Most importantly, plasma cytokines, lymphocyte clustering and antibody detection are routinely examined, which was reported to be important indicators of the prognosis. In this patient, we found IL-2, IL-4, 1L-6, and IL-10 levels were elevated after operation and IL-2 level was reduced significantly when checking again, indicating a transient inflammatory response instead of cytokine storm. The patient had a good outcome, who had no cough, fever, pharyngeal swab nucleic acid rejuvenation or other symptoms after surgery, and lung CT showed lesion absorption. In summary, the surgical treatment did not aggravate the progression of COVID-19.",
