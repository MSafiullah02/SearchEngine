Like SARS and MERS before it, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that was previously confined to an animal species, has made its way into the human population with devastating results [1]. Given the scope of the problem and because at the time of this writing there is no vaccine to prevent infection or proven therapy to treat it, attention is understandably riveted on mitigating the immediate health and economic consequences of COVID-19. Elected officials, community leaders, health care providers, and scientists are scrambling to respond to the expanding spread of disease in the United States and elsewhere around the world. At a time when society\u2019s efforts are necessarily focused on our acute response to this pandemic, it may seem wrong-headed to think about longer-term strategies in response to SARS-CoV-2. But arguably there is benefit in planning beyond immediate needs and circumstances. Said consideration derives from the fact that even after the current wave of this pandemic subsides, we will not have eradicated SARS-CoV-2. Nor will we be spared from future pandemics of other viruses, whether they be respiratory, enteric or bloodborne.",

            "text": "What can history teach us about successful responses to past infectious disease pandemics? Given the widespread implementation of social distancing (also known by the more accurate designation of \u201cphysical distancing\u201d) in response to COVID-19 disease, public health leaders are deeply interested in the outcomes of these same so-called \u201cnonpharmaceutical interventions\u201d when they were deployed in response to another deadly pandemic of a respiratory virus, the influenza epidemic of 1918\u20131919 [2]. Contemporary analyses support the fact that these interventions, when implemented early and in a sustained manner, were successful in mitigating the consequences of pandemic influenza in the last century [3]. That valuable information is being put to good use during the current wave of SARS-CoV-2. But what can we say about the public health responses that were undertaken in the years following the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic, after the immediate threat had passed? Certainly, there was increased research interest into the causative agent of influenza, leading to the eventual isolation of influenza A from human tissue samples in 1933 [4]. And historians have noted that the lack of a national disease reporting system in the U.S.\u2014which hindered a coordinated response to the influenza outbreak of 1918/1919\u2014was rectified several years later; by 1925 all U.S. states were participating in a national system to report disease [5]. But given the periodicity of influenza, it\u2019s come-and-go nature, some experts have opined that our national response to pandemics typically follows a cycle of \u201cpanic\u2013neglect\u2013panic\u2013neglect\u201d [6]. Sadly, this supposition is supported by patterns of public health funding in the U.S. Typically, after a national disease outbreak or other disaster there is an infusion of one-time supplemental funding which generally recedes after the emergency wanes and the attention of legislators turns to other, more immediate issues [7].",

Do we have a test that can accurately diagnose infection? How long will it take for scientists to develop an effective vaccine that can prevent disease acquisition? Are any drugs available that can cure or safely treat persons once they\u2019ve become infected? To be sure, each one of these elements\u2014accurate diagnostic test, effective vaccine, successful treatment\u2014is critical but by themselves they do not constitute an adequate pandemic response. Why? Because, simply stated, a pandemic\u2019s impact is not just experienced at the level of the infected individual. By their very nature, pandemics adversely affect large segments of the population, thereby generating negative consequences that spread across social systems and structures. It follows, then, that successful responses to pandemics must include the implementation of societal-level responses and system-wide interventions. To wit, during a pandemic the goal of public health is to protect the health of the entire population, not just to prevent or treat disease among specific individuals.",

The most accurate diagnostic test will be of little value without a stable system to deliver it in a timely manner to everyone in need\u2014or a sufficiently scaled workforce that\u2019s been trained to properly collect and analyze the large influx of specimens. Without strong community partnerships to amplify health communication messages coming from public health leaders, panic and misinformation can scuttle the uptake of strategies meant to keep communities safe. For example, a handful of anecdotal reports about negative reactions to a new vaccine could impede community uptake, resulting in substantial missed opportunities for immunization. And even curative treatments will be of little value if large segments of the population in need of them are uninsured or underinsured and unable to afford the therapy [8]. Each of these scenarios point out that effective biomedical tools, by themselves, cannot end epidemics. In addition to effective tools and interventions we need surveillance systems to assess and target their need; viable community partnerships across all segments of the public health system to assure that interventions are delivered in a timely, equitable and culturally competent manner; policies, processes and information systems that can continuously monitor the interventions\u2019 impact; and a standing public health workforce of sufficient size that is properly equipped and capable of providing these services, in collaboration with other community partners.",

To be clear, this comparison is made in reference to our nation\u2019s eventual response to HIV\u2014not to its initial response, which was typified largely by denial. Early on, most legislators and policy makers ignored the emerging AIDS epidemic, characterizing it as the consequence of unhealthy behaviors practiced by homosexual men and persons who inject illicit drugs [9]. But a cadre of fearless community activists and farsighted public health leaders were eventually able to push forward a comprehensive agenda that resulted in long term funding for surveillance systems to monitor the spread of disease [10], community-based systems to test for and prevent HIV infection among the vulnerable [11] and a national system to provide comprehensive medical care, essential support services and needed medications for uninsured and underinsured persons living with HIV\u2014the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program [12]. Nor should we overlook America\u2019s substantial contribution to fighting the global spread of HIV. In 2003 the United States government implemented PEPFAR, the largest global health program devoted to a single disease, credited with saving millions of lives globally [13].",
