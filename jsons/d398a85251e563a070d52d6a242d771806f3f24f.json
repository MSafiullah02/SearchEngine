Relationship levels in our framework are assumed to influence transaction costs as well as risk for the decision-makers. We propose a network performance measure for the evaluation of the global supply chain networks efficiency and vulnerability. The measure captures risk, transaction cost, price, transaction flow, revenue, and demand information in the context of the decision-makers behavior the network. The network consists of manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. Manufacturers and retailers are multicriteria decisionmakers who decide about their production and transaction quantities as well as the level of social relationship they want to pursue in order to maximize net return and minimize risk. The model allows us to investigate the interplay of the heterogeneous decision-makers in the supply chain and to compute the resultant equilibrium pattern of product outputs, transactions, product prices, and levels of social relationship. The results show that high levels of relationship can lead to lower overall cost and therefore lower price and higher product transaction. Moreover, we use the performance measure to assess which nodes in the supply networks are the most vulnerable in the sense that their removal will impact the performance of the network in the most significant way.

We describe the role of relationships in the global supply chain networks. Decision-makers in a given tier of the network can decide on the relationship levels that they want to achieve with decision-makers associated with the other tiers of the network. Establishing/maintaining a certain relationship level induces some costs, but may also lower the risk and the transaction costs. We explicitly describe the role of relationships in influencing transaction costs and risk. Both the risk functions and the relationship cost functions are allowed to depend on the relationship levels. In addition, we analyze the effects of the levels of social relationship on the supply chain efficiency and vulnerability. Hence, we truly capture the effects of networks of relationships in the global supply chain framework.",

            "text": "In recent years, growing competition and emphasis on efficiency and cost reduction, as well as the satisfaction of consumer demands, have brought new challenges for businesses in the global marketplace. As a result companies are outsourcing and offshoring large portions of manufacturing, sourcing in low-cost countries, reducing inventories, streamlining the supply base, and collaborating more intensively with other supply chain actors [12, 19] . However, the increase in interfirm dependence as well as longer and more complex supply chain setups with globe-spanning operations have increased the vulnerability of supply chains to unexpected events [6, 17, 18, 36] . For example, recently, the threat of illness in the form of SARS (see [10] ) has disrupted supply chains, as have terrorist threats (cf. [34] ) and the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Indeed, at the same time that supply chains have become increasingly globalized, their operation environment has become unpredictable and filled with uncertainty.",

The main supply chain vulnerability drivers can be divided in three groups, demand-side, supply-side, and Catastrophic events. The demandside drivers would include demand uncertainty, customer dependence, and disruptions in the physical distribution of products to the end-customers. The supply-side drivers include supplier business risks, production capacity constraints on the supply market, quality problems, technological changes, and product design changes [39] . Moreover these drivers would increase supply chain vulnerability even more if the firm uses single sourcing or fewer suppliers. Catastrophic events refer to natural hazards, socio-political instability, civil unrest, economic disruptions, and terrorist attacks [26, 24] . Therefore we believe that firms should proactively assess and manage the uncertainties in supply chain by creating a portfolio of relationships with their suppliers and demand markets in order to guard against costly supply chain disruptions.",

            "text": "The value of relationship is not only economical but also technical and social [14] . Strong supply chain relationships enable firms to react to changes in the market, create customer value and loyalty, which lead to improve profit margins [11] . The benefits are reduction of production, transportation and administrative costs. On the technical development the greatest benefit is the possibility of sharing the resources of suppliers and shortening the lead-times. Spekman and Davis [35] found that supply chain networks that exhibit collaborative behaviors tend to be more responsive and that supply chain-wide costs are, hence, reduced. These results are also supported by Dyer [9] who demonstrated empirically that a higher level of trust (relationship) lowers transaction costs (costs associated with negotiating, monitoring, and enforcing contracts). Baker and Faulkner [1] present an overview of papers by economic sociologists that show the important role of relationships due to their potential to reduce risk and uncertainty. Uzzi [37] and Gadde and Snehota [14] suggest that multiple relationships can help companies deal with the negative consequences related to dependence on supply chain partners. Krause et al. [25] found that buyer commitment and social capital accumulation with key suppliers can improve buying company performance. However, Christopher and J\u00fcttner [5] indicate that the value of the relationship depends on the substitutability of the buyers or sellers, the indispensability of goods, savings resulting from partner's practices and the degree of common interest.",

These relationship production cost functions may be distinct for each such combination. Their specific functional forms may be influenced by such factors as the willingness of retailers or demand markets to establish/maintain a relationship as well as the level of previous business relationships and private relationships that exist. Hence, we assume that these production cost functions are also affected and influenced by the relationship levels. Crosby and Stephens [7] indicate that the relationship strength changes with the amount of buyer-seller interaction and communication. In a global setting, cultural differences, difficulties with languages, and distances, may also play a role in making it more costly to establish (and to maintain) a specific relationship level (cf. [20] ). The concept of relationship levels was inspired by a paper by Golicic et al. [15] who introduced the concept of relationship magnitude. That research strongly suggested that different relationship magnitudes lead to different benefits and those different levels of relationship magnitudes can be achieved by putting more or less time and effort into the relationship. The idea of a continuum of relationship strength is also supported by several theories of relationship marketing that suggest that business relationships vary on a continuum from transactional to highly relational (cf. [13] ). The model by Wakolbinger and Nagurney [38] operationalized the frequently mentioned need to create a portfolio of relationships (cf. [4, 15] ). The optimal portfolio balanced out the various costs and the risk, against the profit and the relationship value and included the individual decision-makers preferences and risk aversions.",

Of course, in certain situations; see also Granovetter [16] , the risk may be adversely affected by higher levels of relationships. Nevertheless, the functions in Table 7 .4 explicitly include relationship levels and product transactions as inputs into the risk functions and reflect this dependence. The demand functions as given in Table 7 .5 are associated with the bottom-tiered nodes of the global supply chain network. The demand of consumers for the product at a demand market in a currency and country depends, in general, not only on the price of the product at that demand market (and currency and country) but also on the prices of the product at the other demand markets (and in other countries and currencies). Consequently, consumers at a demand market, in a sense, also compete with consumers at other demand markets. We now turn to describing the behavior of the various economic decision-makers. The model is presented, for ease of exposition, for the case of a single homogeneous product. It can also handle multiple products through a replication of the links and added notation.

[33] )). Of course, one can also impose explicit capacity constraints and this would then just change the underlying feasible set(s) so that k would need to be redefined accordingly. However, the function F .X/ in variational inequality (7.18) would remain the same (see, e. g., [27] ). Finally, since we consider a single homogeneous product the exchange rates e h are assumed fixed (and relative to a base currency). Once can, of course, investigate numerous exchange rate and demand scenarios by altering the demand functions and the fixed exchange rates and then recomputing the new equilibrium product transaction, price, and relationship level equilibrium patterns.",

Table 6 shows the results of this analysis. Note that, given the cost structure and the demand price functions, since the retailer's nodes carry the largest amount of equilibrium product flow, they are ranked the most important. The negative importance values for demand markets are due to the fact that the existence of each demand market brings extra flows on the transaction links and nodes and, therefore, increases the marginal transaction cost. The removal of one demand market has two effects: first, the contribution to the network performance of the removed demand market becomes zero; second, the marginal transaction cost on links/nodes decreases, which decreases the equilibrium prices and increases the demand at the other demand markets. If the performance drop caused by the removal of the demand markets is overcompensated by the improvement of the demand-price ratio of the other demand markets, the removed demand market will have a negative importance value. It simply implies that the negative externality caused by the demand market has a larger impact than the performance drop due to its removal.",

On the technical development the greatest benefit is the possibility of sharing the resources of suppliers and shortening the lead-times. Spekman and Davis [35] found that supply chain networks that exhibit collaborative behaviors tend to be more responsive and that supply chain-wide costs are, hence, reduced. These results are also supported by our economic model where we demonstrated that a higher level of relationship lowers transaction costs and risk and uncertainty. As a result, supply chain prices are reduced and the overall transactions increases.",

The measure captures risk, transaction cost, price, transaction flow, revenue, and demand information in the context of the decision-makers behavior. Manufacturers and retailers are multicriteria decision-makers who decide about their production and transaction quantities as well as the amount of social relationship they want to pursue in order to maximize net return and minimize risk.",

How do the combinations of these elements play in each time period and stage of the supply chain? These questions await empirical study.
