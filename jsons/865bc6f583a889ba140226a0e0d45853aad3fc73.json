Four structural proteins are encoded on the genome: the L protein (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) on segment L, two glycoproteins Gn and Gc on segment M, the nucleocapsid protein on segment N and the nonstructural protein NSs on segment S. Banyangviruses can infect vertebrates and invertebrates and have caused febrile infections, encephalitis and severe fevers with fatal outcome in humans, therefore being increasingly reported as emerging pathogens of public health importance 1-3 . Recently, two novel tick-borne phenuiviruses (Huaiyangshan banyangvirus [BHAV] and Heartland virus [HRTV]) were detected and characterized; they form, together with Guertu banyangvirus a new genus within the Phenuiviridae genus: the Banyangviruses clade 1,2 . BHAV was initially reported in 2011 in the Henan and Hubei Provinces, China. Patients showed fever or hemorrhagic fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia and multi-organ dysfunction with an initial case fatality rate of 30% 1,4 . By then, the etiological virus was isolated from patients' blood and Haemaphysalis longicornis and Rhipicephalus microplus ticks throughout China, South Korea and Japan 5,6 . Similar symptoms were recognized in two men from Missouri, USA. The respective virus, named Heartland virus (HRTV), was isolated in 2012 from patients' blood and Amblyomma americanum ticks collected in the field 2,7 . A third novel banyangvirus with close relation to BHAV and HRTV was detected in Tasmania State, Australia. The virus, named Hunter Island Group virus (HIGV), was isolated from Ixodes eudyptidis ticks which were blood-feeding on a shy albatross (Thalassarche cauta) colony with signs of unknown disease outbreak 8 . Despite the identification of ticks as vectors for BHAV, HRTV and HIGV, the amplifying or reservoir hosts of the viral pathogens remain unknown.",

As shown before, NSm is important for infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes 15 . However, although Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks are supposed to be the vector of BHAV, most infected patients did not report tick bites prior to disease onset 1 .

All work was performed at Biosafety level-2 conditions with appropriate precautions. After obtaining the result that Zwiesel virus is related to SFTS virus (rated BSL-4 in Germany), further work on the original material was restricted to BSL-3. Homogenized organs [n = 31] with potentially virus-related histopathological changes (data available on request) were pooled (Table 1) , followed by purification and enrichment of viruses directly from virus-infected tissue and subsequent deep sequencing of the virome 17 . Deep sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq. 1500 (Illumina Inc.) technology according to the Illumina sequencing protocol. Raw reads were trimmed for primers, adapters, low-quality bases and length (>30 bp) 18 . Sequences that mapped to RefSeq sequences of eukaryotes, fungi and bacteria using Bowtie 2 version 2.2.6 with default parameters were discarded. Remaining reads were de novo assembled using Velvet assembler 1.2.10 in default mode 19, 20 . Contigs and remaining sequences were aligned to the NCBI RefSeq viral protein database using DIAMOND v0.7.1 21 . All contigs and sequences with similarity to members of the genus Banyangvirus were assembled into larger contigs.
