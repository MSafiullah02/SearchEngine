            "text": "There is resurgence in the use of herbal medicines worldwide. An estimated one third of adults in the Western world use alternative therapies, including herbs. These herbs may be used either in their primary forms or combined into mixtures. In contrast to chemical drugs, herbs have sometimes been claimed to be non-toxic, because of their natural origin and long-term use as folk medicines. However, problems may arise due to intrinsic toxicity, adulteration, substitution, contamination, misidentification, drug-herb interactions, and lack of standardizationDe Smet, 1995, Ernst, 2002, Ernst and Pittler, 2002, Koh and Woo, 2000. Both adverse drug reactions and poisonings associated with the use of herbal medicines have increasingly been reported Deng, 2002, Ernst and Pittler, 2002, Klepser and Klepser, 1999.

Metabolic activation of procarcinogens is often catalyzed by a limited number of human CYPs including CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6 and 3A4 Guengerich, 2001, Guengerich and Liebler, 1985, Guengerich and Shimada, 1991, Zhou, 2003. Among them, CYP1A and 1B enzymes bioactivate polycyclic arylamines, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and aflatoxin B1 (Gonzalez and Gelboin, 1994). These enzymes are regarded as the targets for blocking tumor initiation and specific CYP inhibitors or inactivators could be beneficial for preventing tumor formation Guengerich and Shimada, 1991, Shimada et al., 1996, Shimada et al., 1989. It is likely that constituents in herbal preparations may be substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYPs (Zhou et al., 2003), and have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of any coadministered drugs metabolized by this system.",

In some cases, the formation of a reactive intermediate by CYP may also lead to the inactivation of the enzyme. CYP substrates, which are metabolized to reactive intermediates that inactivate the enzyme, are classified as mechanism-based inhibitors. Thus, the inhibition of CYP-mediated carcinogen activation by herbal/dietary constituents has been extensively studied.",

This review highlights the role of formation of reactive intermediates via bioactivation in herbal toxicity using aristolochic acids, pulegone and germander as examples.

The predominant AAs are AAI (8-methoxy-6-nitro-phenanthro-(3,4-d)-1,3-dioxolo-5-carboxylic acid) and AAII (6-nitro-phenanthro-(3,4-d)-1,3-dioxolo-5-carboxylic acid). The consumption of herbs containing AAs has been associated with severe nephropathy which is characterized by unique renal fibrosis and development of urothelial cancer Abt et al., 1995, Arlt et al., 2002, Cosyns, 2003, Lord et al., 2001, Nortier and Vanherweghem, 2002, Schwetz, 2001, Zhu, 2002. Approximately 200 cases of AA nephropathy have been reported worldwide, with many of them needing renal replacement therapy (Arlt et al., 2002). A large cohort of these patients with AA nephropathy have developed urothelial cancer Cosyns, 2003, Nortier and Vanherweghem, 2002.",

This is consistent with the identification of an N6-deoxyadenosine-AAI adduct formed in vitro and in patients. All these results indicated that deoxyadenosine adduct formation was a critical step in tumor initiation by AAs. A recent study using the \u03bb/lacZ transgenic mice has shown that administration of AAs caused selective AT\u2192TA mutations (Kohara et al., 2002), which is in agreement with the extensive 7-(deoxyadenosin-N6-yl)aristolactam I adduct formation in rats and humans. In rats treated with a single dose of AAI, the 7(deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)aristolactam I adduct was removed continuously from the DNA, whereas the 7-(deoxyadenosin-N6-yl)aristolactam I adduct persisted without proper repair of the DNA (Fernando et al., 1993), leading to mutations and oncogene activation.",

These metabolites accounted for only 3% of total radioactivity excreted in bile, and their structures could not be established solely by mass spectral analysis. The metabolism of pulegone in rats involves three major metabolic pathways: a) conjugation by glucuronic acid following C-5 or methyl group hydroxylation or by GSH; with the conjugates being further metabolized; b) the formation of menthofuran; and c) the formation of piperitenone beginning with 5-hydroxylation followed by dehydration (Fig. 2)\nChen et al., 2001, Madyastha and Gaikwad, 1999, Madyastha and Raj, 1992, Madyastha and Raj, 1993. The CYP system plays an important role in the metabolism of R-(+)-pulegone Madyastha and Gaikwad, 1999, Madyastha and Raj, 1992. Most of the metabolites of pulegone are derived from menthofuran and piperitenone Madyastha and Gaikwad, 1999, Madyastha and Raj, 1992, Madyastha and Raj, 1993. Studies carried out in vivo have shown 4-methyl-2-cyclohexenone as one of the metabolites of R-(+)-pulegone (Madyastha and Raj, 1993), and conversion of 4-methyl-2-cyclohexenone to p-cresol has been demonstrated in vitro Madyastha and Raj, 1990, Madyastha and Raj, 1993, Madyastha and Raj, 2002.",

Germander contains saponins, glycosides, flavonoids and furano neoclerodane diterpenoids (Piozzi et al., 1987). The hepatotoxicity has been ascribed to the diterpenoids including teucrin A and teuchamaedryn A. The furan ring of these diterpenoids is oxidized by CYP3A4 to reactive epoxide which reacts with proteins such as CYP3A and epoxide hydrolase (Fig. 3)\nFau et al., 1997, Lekehal et al., 1996, Loeper et al., 2001, Loeper et al., 1994. The reactive epoxide led to mitochondrial permeability transition, caspase activation, and apoptosis in rat and mouse hepatocytes Fau et al., 1997, Lekehal et al., 1996, Loeper et al., 1994. Teucrin A covalently bound to rat hepatocyte proteins, and the furano diterpenoid fraction decreased cell GSH and cytoskeleton-associated protein thiols, but increased cytosolic levels of Ca2+\nFau et al., 1997, Lekehal et al., 1996.

Pretreatment of male rats with troleandomycin (an inhibitor of CYP3A) reduced cellular GSH depletion and cytotoxicity, whereas dexamethasone treatment (an inducer of CYP3A) had opposite effects (Lekehal et al., 1996). Feeding male rats with a sulfur amino acid-deficient diet decreased cellular GSH level and enhanced cytotoxicity, whereas supplementation of the standard diet with cystine had opposite effects (Lekehal et al., 1996). Female rat hepatocytes exhibited little toxicity as they expressed low levels of CYP3A, unless the animals were treated with dexamethasone (Lekehal et al., 1996). Furthermore, the hepatotoxicity in mice was attenuated by pretreatment with butylated hydroxyanisole or clofibrate (two inducers of microsomal epoxide hydrolase) and markedly increased by phorone-induced GSH depletion (Loeper et al., 1994). Pretreatment of mice with either 3-methylcholanthrene or phenobarbital had no effect (Loeper et al., 1994). In addition, genetic factors may be important for the development of germander-induced hepatotoxicity. For example, polymorphism of CYP3A and major histocompability complex molecule can affect the formation of toxic metabolite and antigen presenting to T helper cells, respectively.",

The resultant reactive species are capable of binding covalently to the active site of CYP2E1 as well as DNA (Surh and Lee, 1995). The interaction with target cell DNA would trigger mutagenicity and malignant transformation. However, metabolism of capsaicinoids by CYPs may also represent a detoxification process (in contrast to bioactivation), resulting in a reduction in cytotoxicity (Reilly et al., 2003).

It also inactivated CYP3A4 following metabolic activation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with kinact and KI values of 0.3 min\u22121 and 7.7 \u03bcM, respectively (He et al., 1998).

During bergamottin-induced inactivation, CYP3A4 retained more than 90% of the heme, but 50% of the apoprotein in the inactivated CYP3A4 could not be recovered. This suggests that the inactivation may involve apoprotein modification in the active site of the enzyme instead of heme adduct formation or heme fragmentation (He et al., 1998).

The usefulness of 8-methoxypsoralen in treating these diseases resides in its ability to be photoactivated to a species capable of binding covalently to nucleic acids and lymphocytes, and thus inhibiting DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. Early studies indicated that 8-methoxypsoralen was a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYPs in rodents Fouin-Fortunet et al., 1986, Labbe et al., 1989, Letteron et al., 1986, Mays et al., 1990 and humans (Tinel et al., 1987).

Licorice contains glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid, a glycoside which is 50 times sweeter than sugar), oleane triterpenoids, glucose, ammonia, polyphenols, flavonoids, and sucrose Hatano et al., 1991a, Hatano et al., 1991b. Flavanoid components of licorice root have been shown to have antitumorigenic, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti inflammatory, estrogen-like, and antioxidative activity Fujisawa et al., 2000, Fukai et al., 2002, Shibata, 2000, Tamir et al., 2001. Licorice root extract, as well as its major flavanoid, the isoflavan glabridin, are potent antioxidants against LDL oxidation in mice and humans (Rosenblat et al., 1999). Glabridin was also shown to inhibit the activity of macrophage NADPH-oxidase presumably by inhibiting protein kinase C and serotonin re-uptake Ofir et al., 2003, Rosenblat et al., 1999. In addition, glycyrrhizin was recently found to be a potent inhibitor of the SARS-associated coronavirus in vitro (Cinatl et al., 2003). However, licorice may cause hypermineralocorticoidism (Nobata et al., 2001), arrhythmia (Bocker and Breithardt, 1991), pseudoaldosteronism (Ferrari et al., 2001), and hypertension (Astrup, 2001). These toxicities have been ascribed to the inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetic acid from licorice on 11-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase (Ferrari et al., 2001).",

Metabolism of glabridin by CYP3A4 resulted in the destruction of the heme moiety, as the loss in activity with different concentrations of glabridin correlated well with the loss in the CYP3A4-reduced carbon oxide spectrum and detectable heme at 405 nm (Kent et al., 2002). No other peaks indicative of glabridin-alkylated heme eluting after the native heme were detected at 405 nm. Presumably glabridin undergoes metabolism, forming reactive intermediates causing heme fragmentation. Incubations with 2,4-dimethylglabridin did not lead to a loss in the enzymatic activity of CYP3A4. Incubation of glabridin with CYP3A4 and NADPH resulted in a metabolites, suggesting that the two hydroxyl groups on the 2\u2032 and 4\u2032 position of the flavonoid B ring of glabridin are required for CYP3A4 inactivation (Fig. 7)\n(Kent et al., 2002). Indeed, these two hydroxyl groups are also believed to be essential for its antioxidative activity (Belinky et al., 1998).",

            "text": "The mechanism of CYP inhibition by isothiocyanates involves both competitive and mechanims-based inhibition. The competitive inhibition involves competition with substrates at the active site of CYP Ishizaki et al., 1990, Smith et al., 1993, while mechanism-based inhibition would involve the metabolic activation of isothiocyanates Goosen et al., 2000, Ishizaki et al., 1990, Lee, 1996, Moreno et al., 1999, Smith et al., 1996. The metabolic activation of isothiocyanates results in reactive intermediates that could ultimately bind to the heme moiety or apoprotein, thereby inactivating the enzyme. For example, BITC was metabolized to a reactive benzyl isocyanate intermediate that is capable of binding covalently to CYP apoprotein or hydrolyzed to form benzylamine (Fig. 8)\n(Goosen et al., 2001). BITC may be oxidized at the \u03b1-carbon to benzaldehyde, instead of being desulfurated to benzyl isocyanate. Alternatively, benzylamine could be deaminated to give benzaldehyde and ammonia. The subsequent oxidation of benzaldehyde would yield benzoic acid. The formation of benzoic acid was also observed in dogs, where administration of BITC resulted in the excretion of hippuric acid, the glycine conjugate of benzoic acid (Br\u00fcsewitz et al., 1997). In humans and rats, BITC is metabolized through conjugation with GSH and finally excreted as mercapturic acid. In addition, oxidative desulfuration of the isothiocyanate could also release elemental sulfur, which could further contribute to enzymatic modification and possibly inactivation, as in the case of parathion (Butler and Murray, 1993).",

A single dose of garlic oil in the rat resulted in a significant inhibition of hepatic CYP-catalyzed reactions including aminopyrine N-demethylase (CYP2C) and aniline hydroxylase (CYP2E1) activity, but administration of garlic for 5 days led to a significant increase in these hepatic CYP activities (Fitzsimmons and Collins, 1997).

It is generated by oxidation from resveratrol, the parent compound and produced by grapevine in response to fungal infection. \u03b5-Viniferin has been shown to have better antifungal and antioxidant activity than resveratrol Baderschneider and Winterhalter, 2000, Bala et al., 2000. \u03b5-Viniferin also had hepatoprotective activity (Oshima et al., 1995).",

A number of clinically important herb-drug interactions have been documented and many of them led to altered efficacy and/or adverse events Fugh-Berman, 2000, Fugh-Berman and Ernst, 2001. Pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions are due to altered absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion of drugs. Frequently, one of the underlying mechanisms of altered drug concentrations by concomitant herbal medicines is the induction or inhibition of hepatic and intestinal CYPs. CYP3A4 are expressed at high levels in the villus tip of enterocytes, the primary site of absorption for orally administered drugs. Thus, the modulation of intestinal CYP3A represents an important mechanism for the enhanced or reduced bioavailability of coadministered drugs. In particular, the mechanism-based inhibition of CYPs (in particular CYP3A4) by herbal constituents may have important pharmacokinetic implications.",

However, a study in mice indicated that diallyl sulfone decreased the plasma levels of oxidative acetaminophen metabolites, but not nonoxidative acetaminophen metabolites (Lin et al., 1996). This is considered to be due to the inhibition of CYP2E1 that is the major enzyme responsible for acetaminophen bioactivation (Manyike et al., 2000). In liver microsomes, diallyl sulfone significantly inhibited the acetaminophen oxidation to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (the toxic metabolite of acetamoniphen) (Lin et al., 1996). All these results provide an explanation for the protective effect of diallyl sulfone on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (Lin et al., 1996). When administered orally 1 hr prior to, immediately after, or 20 min after a toxic dose of acetaminophen, diallyl sulfone (25 mg/kg) completely protected mice from development of hepatotoxicity (Lin et al., 1996).",

Clinical evidence has indicated the feasibility of this approach in reducing the risk of major human cancers. For example, tamoxifen and raloxifene (both oestrogen receptor modulators) reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women at increased risk Fisher et al., 1998, Salih and Fentiman, 2001. Results with aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents have proved consistently encouraging in epidemiological studies in lowering the incidence of colorectal cancer (Jolly et al., 2002). However, although these compounds have shown a potential to reduce cancer incidence, several problems have been associated with them. These include severe side effects due to long-term use, high costs and non-compliance. Therefore, safer and more selective chemopreventive agents are needed.",

In most studies, the chemopreventative activity of isothiocyanates required administration either before or during exposure to the carcinogen. PEITC inhibits lung carcinogenesis induced by the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, whereas BITC is ineffective in this regard (Staretz and Hecht, 1995). In turn, BITC effectively inhibits benzo(a)pyrene-induced lung tumors in A/J mice, whereas PEITC is ineffective (Lin et al., 1993). These effects might be related to the inhibitory mechanisms and potencies for CYP2B1 and 1A, respectively. Some isothiocyanates such as PEITC are able to induce CYP2B1 and 2E1 following chronic administration, with increased toxicity (Smith et al., 1993). The extensive conjugation of BITC with GSH might also be important for the in vivo effects of BITC. The conjugation with GSH has been shown to decrease potency, and could contribute to mutagenicity (Raulf-Heimsoth and Baur, 1998). It appears that local release of the conjugated product might also contribute to the toxicity of BITC (Hirose et al., 1998).",

The mechanism for these effects is not completely understood, but multiple effects of resveratrol may be involved. Inhibition of Phase I enzymes and induction of Phase II enzymes will contribute to the chemopreventive activity of resveratrol Dubuisson et al., 2002, Jang et al., 1997. It also has activity in the regulation of multiple cellular events associated with carcinogenesis. However, it is not known whether resveratrol inhibits the catalytic activity of CYP1A1, 1A2, and 1A2 in vivo. The potential in vivo effect of resveratrol on the bioactivation of CYP1 substrates may depend not only on the pharmacokinetics of resveratrol but also the tissue of interest (Schwedhelm et al., 2003). It is known that the expression of many CYPs such as CYP1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 is tissue-dependent (Omiecinski et al., 1999).",

The resultant reactive intermediates bind covalently to DNA and proteins, leading to organ toxicity and even carcinogenicity. On the other hand, some herbal/dietary constituents were shown to form reactive intermediates capable of irreversibly inhibiting various CYPs. The resultant metabolites lead to CYP inactivation by chemical modification of the heme, the apoprotein, or both as a result of covalent binding of modified heme to the apoprotein. The mechanism-based inhibition of CYPs may provide an explanation for some reported herb-drug interactions. Naturally occurring compounds that inactivate CYPs may represent a novel type of chemopreventive agents with higher selectivity and lower toxicity compared to synthetic compounds.",
