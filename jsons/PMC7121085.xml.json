            "text": "Early in the new millennium the goal of many theatre artists who addressed the epidemic in China was to alert audiences to its immediacy, to keep them from fearing it and to reduce isolation and shame endured by affected individuals. The need for such goals becomes clear as one considers the cultivation of stigma over the preceding decades. The trajectory of the AIDS epidemic in China is often divided into three stages (Shao 2001; Huang 2013). Yiming Shao, Chief Expert on AIDS for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, describes the \u2018introductory phase\u2019 as between roughly 1985 and 1988, when a popular perception of AIDS as a foreign disease was established. During this period, a small number of cases involving foreigners and Chinese citizens who had been traveling internationally was identified in coastal cities. Yanzhong Huang, Senior Fellow for Global Health for the Council on Foreign Relations, assesses the impact of these early cases on the perception of the growing crisis:The initial statistics reinforced the myth that HIV/AIDS was not so much a public health problem as a social ill confined to Western countries. Like their US counterparts, Chinese scientists and public health officials were initially convinced that HIV/AIDS spread mainly through homosexuality and promiscuity (Xinhua July 22, 1987). Believing that both behaviors were \u2018illegal and contrary to Chinese morality\u2019 and therefore limited in China, senior health officials were confident that the AIDS epidemic was unlikely to occur within their borders. (2013: 86\u201387)The second, \u2018slow\u2019 or \u2018regional\u2019 phase of the epidemic, is attributed to the period between 1989 and 1994 and describes the steady increase in incidence and the appearance of the disease within border regions of the country. It is often marked by the identification of 146 HIV-positive intravenous drug users within China\u2019s southwest Yunnan province. HIV spread widely during this phase, reaching the majority of China\u2019s provinces and adding several hundred cases each year. The geographical site of the next turning point lies in the central Henan province, where the practice of selling blood for cash was widespread in the mid-1990s and HIV infection in the region was recorded at over 50 per cent of the population (Rosenthal Sept. 16, 2001a). By 1995, HIV incidence climbed into the thousands.",

By 1998, HIV or AIDS cases were reported in all thirty-one provinces; China documented its first case of mother-to-child transmission, and sexual transmission of the disease had rapidly increased. Still, intravenous drug use and commercial blood and plasma donation accounted for the majority of transmissions during this phase, at 43.9 per cent and 24.1 per cent of the estimated number of HIV infections, respectively (China Ministry of Health 2004). The government estimates that in just four years, between 1999 and 2003, the number of people living in China with HIV increased from 500,000 to 840,000 (Thompson 2005: 4). During this pivotal period in the first years of the new millennium, theatre artists directly engaged with new governmental policies, cultural identity, and social realities for people living with HIV or AIDS. Their productions serve as time capsules of a radical shift in the nation\u2019s response to the epidemic.",

[It] explores the theme of AIDS from social, family, ethic [sic] and moral perspectives, cautioning people to keep away from AIDS and calling for social concern for AIDS patients\u2019 (State Council 2001). Foreshadowing the theatre about to emerge, government leaders invested in the power of entertainment to bring issues surrounding HIV to the public\u2019s attention. Even through this first programme of its kind, conservative morality was linked to a promoted national identity.",

The changes occurred quickly; in 1999, a short public-service announcement promoting condom use was pulled from television by officials who worried that it was \u2018too risqu\u00e9\u2019, but only two years later safer sex was openly discussed on the radio. Even with more open public discussion, stigma remained and news coverage at the turn of the millennium still reinforced early perceptions of HIV and AIDS as a problem linked to foreigners; people living with HIV or AIDS featured on television had generally contracted HIV overseas and concealed their identity by wearing sunglasses or turning their backs to the camera (Rosenthal 5 December 2001b). Social discrimination was widespread, manifest through well-documented isolation, the loss of resources and services, verbal stigma, secondary stigma endured by family members and fellow villagers, and even self-discriminating behaviour (Cao et al. 2006; Hardee et al. 2009).",

In an iconographic watershed moment, Prime Minister Wen publicly shook the hand of a person living with HIV. Laslocky writes:Many say it took a televised handshake for China to wake up. On World AIDS Day 2003, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao shook the hand of an HIV-positive person, and a close-up of their joined hands was broadcast around the country. Finally, with by some estimates one million AIDS victims [sic] in Henan province alone, silence was no longer an option, and the country\u2019s leaders were scrambling to come up with policies to show that they had a plan. (Laslocky 2007)That year, a new administration headed by President Hu Jintao, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and Vice Premier and the then Health Minister Wu Yi put the implementation of evidence-based HIV policies high on the national agenda (Sun et al. 2010) and announced a new national AIDS control policy, \u2018Four Frees and One Care\u2019 (free treatment, free Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT), free Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMCT) and free schooling for AIDS orphans, as well as provision of social relief for HIV patients).6 However, such high-level policy making could not in and of itself prompt deep cultural change; after a photo of President Hu Jintao shaking hands with a person living with HIV was published, the man\u2019s daughter was expelled from school because of her father\u2019s serostatus (Wan 2014). The impression of government leadership was important, however, and two plays at high-profile state theatres captured this dramatic shift in policy and served as a tool for prevention, stigma reduction and national image preservation.",

The Board did, however, supply printed educational materials to distribute to audiences. This act demonstrates conflict among government leaders: while some stress that formal educational materials cannot adequately capture the human dimension of the epidemic (Pu 2005), not everyone was willing to step away from traditional modes of education and prevention, even during this period of increased awareness and HIV and AIDS policy reform. Nevertheless, the internationally acclaimed theatre is a flagship of modern China\u2019s culture and to produce the play on this topic in the first place was a demonstration of commitment to the issue.",

The play, written by Li Rong and Li Shengying and directed by Terence Chang, is based on actual events that were documented by journalist Tu Qiao in a monthly newspaper column and her subsequent book entitled A Century\u2019s Sorrows (2000). It depicts the development of a trusting relationship between the journalist and Xiao Lu, a person living with HIV. The Dying Kiss is a zhuxuanlu, or main melody play, one that reinforces government-supported values. Claire Conceison explores the complexity of the \u2018main melody\u2019 campaign in Chinese spoken drama, describing a \u2018complicated dialectic with which the government was able to exert control over theatre workers while at the same time theatre workers were able to manipulate this control to their own advantage\u2019 (1994).

            "text": "A nationalistic view of China is reinforced through heroic action, gender dynamics, and echoes of the long-promoted idea that HIV and AIDS permeated China\u2019s borders from abroad; much is made of the idea that Xiao Lu acquired HIV while in Thailand. The protagonist is Chinese, and national pride is evoked as transmission is portrayed through valiant action: Xiao Lu saved the life of a co-worker when an industrial sewing machine punctured her hand. When he gallantly freed her, it fell down upon him, puncturing his finger (21\u201322). The gender dynamics in this scenario are significant. As Alicia Leung argues (2003), at the time of this production, China \u2018maintained a high degree of control over gender construction in order to legitimize its historical achievement of revolution and liberation, \u2026 This is derived from the core philosophy Confucianism in which human role relations are cultivated and developed within a male-centered world\u2019 (359). Therefore, Xiao Lu was upholding core, nationalist values when he contracted HIV (while overseas) and is thereby presented as one of the play\u2019s \u2018innocent victims\u2019. What the play does manage to achieve is to show discrimination in medical care in China, from references to nurses hiding from people living with HIV (4) to Xiao Lu\u2019s decision to seek treatment overseas (9). The play contrasts the blame, social stigma and harsh treatment in China with compassion and care at a treatment centre in Thailand.10 A late scene between Xiao Lu and his doctor serves as a direct critique of the national response while providing a vision of the future (that aligns with the new governmental policies):DIRECTOR CAI: I should apologize to you. \u2026 Do you remember how I distrusted and doubted you when we met for the first time?XIAO LU: That was normal. Everyone would think like that.DIRECTOR CAI: Xiao Lu, it is not right to think in that way, especially as medical personnel. No matter how this person got AIDS, he deserves our sympathy and needs our devoted care. Any prejudice would just hurt them more deeply, which fails to help people fight the plague by weakening their fighting capacity. \u2026 I wonder why a patient tries so hard to try to prove his innocence? Doesn\u2019t it reflect prejudice ingrained in our values? While people are suspecting and despising each other, AIDS becomes increasingly rampant, devouring our land and our lives! I think that only when we create a better recovery? environment and cultural? atmosphere, can we help patients to fight disease and make a miracle. In a sense, every patient is a soldier who fights in the frontline. (Li and Li 2003: 24)As the scene draws to a close, Director Cai and Xu Qian (our audience surrogate) reflect on how much they\u2019ve learned from Xiao Lu.",

Drawing on this notion of blame and guilt associated with HIV and AIDS, the play provides an indictment of capitalism and perceived Western values while emphasising a commitment to core values of Chinese nationalism. Perhaps no scene documents this denunciation with greater clarity than a flashback to \u2018Heaven\u2019s Home\u2019, the treatment facility in Thailand where Xiao Lu receives care. Making a strong contrast with the hospitals of China, Xiao Lu describes his new surroundings to the audience: \u2018Here people are absolutely equal. Here, the doctors and nurses are kind hearted like angels. They gave me comfort and the newest treatment\u2019 (18).11 There, Xiao Lu meets a monk, whose lived Buddhist values stand in sharp contrast to Xiao Lu\u2019s father\u2019s claimed Christianity. The monk\u2019s story serves as a critique of capitalist values, further emphasising that some\u2014antinationalist\u2014behaviours make people \u2018deserve\u2019 to have HIV. The monk used to be a government official with a \u2018loving, sweet wife, a smart son in high school\u2019. He then grew jealous of friends who had more money and beautiful women and quit his government job to go into business: \u2018At that time, bosses were flying all over the sky, CEOs were prevailing on the land. When you yell boss or CEO on the street, nine out of ten people would turn around. It\u2019s worth nothing.\u2019 He made a lot of money (19). He reveals that he contracted HIV through infidelity and that, \u2018without knowing, I brought the disease to my wife\u2019 and his son has since cut off contact with him. Now, devoted to his spiritual life, he explains:I know I\u2019m going to hell. Then why don\u2019t I use my last time to make friends and contribute to the society to build a better afterlife? \u2026 I will use Buddha\u2019s great wisdom to light your fire of life, use Buddha\u2019s endless power to ignite your courage to conquer the disease, and use Buddha\u2019s forgiveness to make clear that you need to cherish your every day, alive. (20)This emphasis on society instead of the individual reflects core Chinese cultural values. Varying degrees of guilt and innocence and a commitment to nationalism emerge through this story. If the monk had not succumbed to capitalist desires, he would still be working for the government with a happy wife and son in further embodiment of cultural values.",

The piece began its development when Tian was approached by representatives of the China Youth Development Foundation to write a play with themes about the devastating impact of AIDS and its prevention among young people. Tian knew of the prejudice and stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS and felt as though, for the newest generation, the increasing incidence of HIV was an educational problem, and not only for those who tested positive. She asked; \u2018Who is paying attention to the people who are in fear? I wanted to explore this question. This play looks at the educational problem in this context\u2019 (Tian 2005a).",

As the educational discussion ends, the audience returns to the fictional world in which a police officer reports that neither the foreigners\u2019 claims of prostitution at the hotel nor Zhao Ping\u2019s claims of harassment are considered reliable and, following review of security footage, Zhao Ping is exonerated. Concluding the play, Zhao Ping, now attending an US university, exchanges emails with Xuedong through which she reveals that she does not have AIDS: she made that up as, indeed, she had made up her boyfriends. Her manipulation of authority figures leaves the audience questioning what might be trusted in their own relationships. Taken in its entirety, Student Zhao Ping is less a play about HIV and AIDS and more about generational conflict and gender construction, but this improvised scene, broken out of the fictional narrative, serves an important purpose: ensuring direct, frank conversation about HIV with the audience. That it does so while promoting a specific brand of condoms is an issue I discuss later (Fig. 9.2).\n",

During my interview with her, she emphasised that this was a time of significant cultural reform; \u2018there was a socialist system for performance approval and a new, special socialism category\u2019 through which the play was finally approved (Tian 2005a).",

Indeed, in order to torment her lover, Zhao Ping plays off the cultural imagination by telling Xuedong that she may have contracted HIV from her foreign boyfriend. Despite the progressive depiction of Zhao Ping\u2019s sexuality, the play presents the police as a conservative moral authority. While they conclude that Zhao Ping had not been engaging in prostitution and so should not face punitive actions from the university, therein lies the condemnation of sex workers. Similarly, Zhao Ping had lied about having a foreign lover, suggesting that her own serostatus might be different if in fact she had had a foreign lover.",

The\nDying\nKiss and Student\nZhao Ping reflected the government\u2019s evolving stance concerning the virus. These plays protected the honour of Chinese national identity by portraying the disease as something entering Chinese society from outside the country\u2019s borders. The plays addressed in this study mark policy change, reflecting experiences that capture a society transitioning from denial to confrontation at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Since the time these plays were produced few theatrical productions in China have approached the topic of HIV and AIDS explicitly, while television and feature films continue to offer representation.12 However, stigma endures (Kazar and Wang 2014) and it remains to be seen how the performing arts in China might productively intervene.",
