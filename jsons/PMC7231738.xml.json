In addition, 93% of patients with initially negative RT-PCR already showed signs of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest-CT and were later confirmed SARS CoV-2 on RT-PCR (4). In a retrospective study analyzing 120 cases with confirmed COVID-19, the authors identified 16 asymptomatic patients with signs of SARS CoV-2 pneumonia on chest CT and were later confirmed SARS CoV-2 positive on RT-PCR.(5) Of note, by applying this strategy we were able to diagnose one SARS-CoV-2 positive patient and consequently safely postponed surgical intervention.",
