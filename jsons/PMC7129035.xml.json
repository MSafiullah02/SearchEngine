Ever since the influential work of Brockmann et al. [4] on the bank note dispersal, researchers have been intrigued by the revealed power-law distributions of human travel displacements [3], [5]. Meanwhile, such empirical studies have increasingly benefited from a variety of advanced data collection technologies (e.g. mobile phone, GPS, social-network sites etc. [15]), reporting the presence of many abnormal properties of human motion, including ultraslow diffusion [3], [4] and strikingly high predictability [6]. It is these abnormal properties that actually shape the difference between the natural human movements and the so-called L\u00e9vy flights [7], [16].",

Ni and Weng [11] investigated the effects of heterogeneous spatial properties in metapopulation networks, and more recently, Belik et al.

In addition, it has been shown that inter-event or waiting time distributions also display non-Poisson statistics. We therefore argue here that an implementation of a hierarchical network in our present study can help us understand highly relevant aspects of real epidemics that are otherwise difficult to capture with models that enable only local behavior, i.e. mixing at only one or two scales [22].",

Here, it is very likely that in the long term, no travelers will move from small-sized to larger cities simply because of the random selection of travelers from a small-sized population pool. Thus, a given small-sized city cannot immediately export infectors even though it is fully infected. This phenomenon will significantly delay the spreading process, which in turn will be gradually enlarged by the hierarchical organization of the system, ultimately resulting in the negative correlation between the spreading velocity and population density. This further implies that the actual population distribution deeply impacts the spreading process: The hierarchical system with many small and loose settlements will result in slower spreading velocity and higher unpredictability.

On the other hand, small dc implies that much more cities will be involved in the screening procedure. Since there are more long-range travelers for larger w, the cost C also increases with the value of w. Fig. 7\n(a) shows the relationship between C and dc for different values of w (in the inset). The bumps visible in Fig. 7(a) are due to the bumpy move length distribution P(d) (shown in Fig. 2(a)). Under this border screening regime, each infected individual participating in a long-range travel (with move length not smaller than dc) will subsequently be quarantined with probability p, or it will keep its infectivity with probability 1-p; thus, p can serve here as the measure of efficiency of border control.",

As expected, the border control of long-range travelers was found to be more efficient for small w, which corresponds to more homogeneous cities and a lower influx of passengers from distant regions. As mentioned previously, when w is large, only a few higher-layer cities can manage to collect the largest fractions of the simulated population, such that a swift local outbreak in higher-layer cities has much more contribution to the overall spread of infections in the rest of the network. Moreover, since larger w implies a more costly border control for the same threshold dc (Fig. 7(a)), the feasibility of this control measure for the condition with the larger city diversity is further reduced. Additionally, the relationship between the ratio \u03c4/\u03c40 and the cost of border screening C is logarithmic for w=1 (the inset in Fig. 7), indicating that the improvement of the border screening efficiency would be rather limited if one would only enlarge the screening range.",

Firstly, our hierarchical geographical network mimics the real-world traffic systems, and secondly, as indicated in Ref. [9], random walks in such hierarchical networks can naturally generate scaling mobility patterns, which are quantitatively in agreement with recent empirical studies on human mobility. Consequentially, the geographical hierarchical network presented in our model not only provides a novel framework for modeling the interaction among various subpopulations, but it also introduces the effects of uniquely human patterns of motion on the contagion spread processes.",

In the early stages of disease transmission, higher-layer cities are at a higher risk for a fast-growing outbreak, which is mainly caused by the infected long-range travelers. This in turn may necessitate top-down procedures such as exit and entry screenings at international borders [38] which were quantitatively studied in our paper.",

Generally, studies of epidemic spreading on directed networks are relatively rare [44], even though directed flow is known as an essential characteristic of many asymmetric real-world processes such as contagion spread in trade networks [45], in which the availability of a given network link does not guarantee the reciprocal connection. Future investigations of epidemics on hierarchical networks should not ignore these issues. For example, in a hierarchically organized system, some starting peripheral nodes could have only out-links, while the majority of others could allow for mobility in both directions; however, some inter-layer transitions or quarantined areas could be specified with in-links only.",

This may further indicate that just as many other natural phenomena, also epidemic spread patterns may have some universal properties that are shared by all world cities and sustained across different cultures and times [46].

This, in turn, indicates the relevance of more precise descriptions of policy objectives when planning a given mitigation strategy. Our study finds that the effectiveness of border control is sensitive to the specific pattern of cities and the associated population distribution. This in turn suggests that the conclusions of previous studies related to special regions [33], [34], [35] could be carefully promoted to other situations. Generally speaking, the underdeveloped and developing countries usually have more homogeneous cities, and some countries with low population density typically have loose population configurations. Accordingly, border control measures may be of higher relevance for arresting epidemics in these countries.",

Our results suggest that the interplay between the dynamics of human spatial behavior and network topology can have important consequences for the global spreading of infectious diseases. We therefore hope that our results can motivate further model extensions that should provide broader insights into the combined effects of human mobility and the organization of geographical networks on spreading processes, with relevant outcomes for both epidemiological studies and health policy.",
