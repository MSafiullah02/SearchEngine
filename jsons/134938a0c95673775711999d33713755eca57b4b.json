Each of the three peripheral HR2 helices shows prominent contacts with the hydrophobic surface of the central HR1 coiled-coil. The concerted protein-protein interactions among the HR helices are responsible for the fusion event that leads to the release of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid into the target host-cell. In this investigation, we applied recombinant protein and synthetic peptide-based biophysical assays to characterize the biological activities of the HR helices. In a parallel experiment, we employed a HIV-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus entry inhibition assay to screen for potent inhibitory activities on HR peptides derived from the SARS-CoV S protein HR regions and a series of other small-molecule drugs. Three HR peptides and five small-molecule drugs were identified as potential inhibitors. ADS-J1, which has been used to interfere with the fusogenesis of HIV-1 onto CD4 \u00fe cells, demonstrated the highest HIV-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus-entry inhibition activity among the other small-molecule drugs. Molecular modeling analysis suggested that ADS-J1 may bind to the deep pocket of the hydrophobic groove on the surface of the central coiled-coil of SARS-CoV S HR protein and prevent the entrance of the SARS-CoV into the host cells.",

            "text": "As a type I membrane glycoprotein, S protein is the major component of the characteristic spikes on the surface of SARS-CoV. It contains a total of 1,255 amino acid residues and is the largest structural protein amongst other SARS-CoV proteins. S protein consists of S1 (residues 12-680) and S2 (residues 681-1,255) subunits, respectively [Spiga et al., 2003; Lio and Goldman, 2004] . The S1 subunit of the S protein is responsible for host cell receptor binding and the S2 subunit is responsible for the membrane fusion process. The functional elements of S2 subunit that are involved in SARS-CoV membrane fusion are: a putative fusion peptide (FP) plus two highly conserved 4,3hydrophobic repeat domains, heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2). The function of these three sequences had been elucidated in the context of prototypic type I fusion proteins, such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gp160 [Eckert and Kim, 2001b] . This suggests a similar membrane fusion mechanism for the SARS-CoV S protein. In HIV-1, binding of S1 subunit to target host cell surface receptor induces global changes in the conformation of S protein, converting the S2 subunit from a native pre-fusion state to a intermediate prehairpin state. This receptor-induced conformational change is expected to facilitate the release of the fusion peptide (FP) and position it to interact with the target host cell membrane. The intermediate pre-hairpin then resolves itself into a final fusogenic state [Eckert and Kim, 2001a] . Biophysical studies on SARS-CoV S protein suggests a similar conformational rearrangement, which leads to the association of the two coiled-coil regions within S2 subunit, where three N-terminal HR1 helices interact with three peripheral C-terminal HR2 helices in an anti-parallel manner to form a stable six-helix coiled-coil bundle structure, which is known as SARS-CoV S protein fusion core Tripet et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004b] . Such fusion core structure facilitates the juxtaposition of the SARS-CoV onto target cell membranes, destabilizes the membrane lipid bilayers and ultimately causes membrane fusion and the release of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid into the host cell.",

In order to clarify the detailed site of interactions between the two heptad repeats, and acquire accurate information for the SARS-CoV S protein fusion core, we have designed synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins that cover both of the HR1 and HR2 regions to study the corresponding protein-protein interactions. Three synthetic peptides were synthesized: HR1-a (residues 899-926), HR1-b (residues 916-950), and HR2 (residues 1,151-1,185), based on the interacting site of HR1 and HR2 suggested by Tripet et al. [2004] ( Fig. 1) . Three recombinant proteins were designed according to Xu et al. [2004b] : His 6 -HR1 (residues 899-958), GST-HR2 or GSTremoved-HR2 (residues 1,145-1,192) and HR-2-Helix. HR-2-Helix is an artificial mini coiled-coil where HR1 (899-958) and HR2 (1, 192) are connected by a 10-amino acid linker (GGSGEFGGSG).",

Both HR1-a and HR1-b did not enter the gel and could not be visualized upon native gel electrophoresis (lanes 2-5). When HR1-b was pre-incubated with HR2, an extra band of lower mobility was observed. The relative intensity of the resulting protein bands correlated stochiometrically to the molar ratio of HR1-b/HR2 sample mixtures (lanes 6 and 7). No mobility shift of the HR2 band was observed when HR2 was incubated with HR1-a (lanes 8 and 9). The absence of complex formation between HR2 and HR1-a is consistent with the absence of inter-chain interactions between HR2 and the N-terminal region of HR-1 reported previously Supekar et al., 2004; Tripet et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004a,b] . Hence, the C-terminal sequences of HR1 (Ile916-Ser950) contains sufficient determinant for interaction with HR2.",

According to our pseudotyped virus entry inhibition assays, ADS-J1 exhibited the highest entry-inhibition activity. In vitro binding interference assays showed that ADS-J1 interfered with the interactions between HR1 and HR2. From the X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV S protein fusion core, there is a deep pocket located within the relatively deep grooves on the surface of central HR1 coiled-coil (Phe909 to Leu927) Supekar et al., 2004; Tripet et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004a; Duquerroy et al., 2005] . This structural pocket is conserved among heptad repeat region of class I membrane fusion proteins. It has been suggested that the presence of the pocket is important for adapting alternative conformations during fusogenesis [Duquerroy et al., 2005] . Anti-HIV drugs, such as T20, have been developed to target this deep groove [Kilby et al., 1998 ]. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV S core peptides showed that four hydrophobic residues from HR2 (Leu1168, Val1171, Leu1175, and Leu1179) penetrate into the deep pocket consisting of Phe909 to Leu920 of HR1 and make extensive hydrophobic contacts with each other (Fig. 7) . This region was chosen to be the drug target site for our in silico molecular modeling studies.",

A ''wedgesto-grooves'' mode of packing was observed within the helix bundle with inter-helical Leu side-chains in van der Waals contact. The Tm of the complex is 648C. This four-helix bundle state is considered one of the intermediate states of folding/unfolding of the fusion core structure during fusogenesis.

We found that HR1-b (Ile916-Ser950) but not HR1-a (Tyr899-Ala926) interacted with HR2, as demonstrated by CD and LS. Interestingly, peptide HR1-a has a higher virus-entry inhibition activity than HR1-b. This suggests that the N-terminal segment of HR1 may interact with regions other than HR2 of the S protein in receptor-binding and/or fusogenesis.",

Our molecular docking modeling shows that the close contact between the highly hydrophobic groups of ADS-J1 and the hydrophobic residues in deep pocket may block the hydrophobic interactions between HR2 and the deep groove of HR1. Also ADS-J1 may prevent the peripheral ionic interaction between HR1 and HR2 by interacting with the positively charged side-chain of Lys911. The predicted docking energy between ADS-J1 and HR1-DP further provides information to guide these investigations.",

The consistent valence force field (CVFF) was selected in all the simulations. The structure of the anti-HIV-1 agent ADS-J1 was constructed with BUILDER module. In this module, the twodimensional image of ADS-J1 was constructed using SKETCHER and was automatically converted into a three-dimensional model by CONVERTER. The X-ray crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S protein fusion core (PDB 1WNC) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) and used as a starting model. One of the HR1 helices from the six-helix coiled-coil bundle was extracted to generate the target site for docking of ADS-J1. Hydrogen atoms were added to the HR1 structure using the BUILDER module. Force field potentials and partial charges were then assigned for both of the structures of HR1 and ADS-J1. These structures were energy-minimized separately using the DISCOVER module and used as the pre-docking structures. A distance-dependent dielectric constant of 80.0 (aqueous solvent) and non-bonded distance cutoff of 20 \u00c5 were used throughout the energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation. Initially, the structures of HR1 and ADS-J1 were minimized for 5,000 iterations of steepest descent energy minimization. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to the resulting structures: the energy-minimized structures were equilibrated at 300 K for 10 picoseconds (ps) and then subjected to 100ps dynamics simulations at the same temperature with sampling steps of 1 femtosecond (fs). According to information derived from the X-ray crystallographic structure of the fusion core [Supekar et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004a; Duquerroy et al., 2005] , four hydrophobic residues from the HR2 (Leu1168, Val1171, Leu1175, and Leu1179) penetrate into one of the three hydrophobic deep pockets or cavities formed between Phe909 and Leu920 on the deep groove region of HR1 (Fig. 8) . Therefore, the region containing all residues (5.0 \u00c5 radius) around this deep pocket was selected as the target site (named HR1-DP) and set up as a grid with the DOCK-ING module. The non-bonded energetics of this region was pre-calculated on the grid. ADS-J1 was first docked into HR1-DP by manual docking using the DOCKING module. The best docking position was based on the docking energy of the ADS-J1/HR1-DP complex. Thousand of orientations of ADS-J1 were searched by maneuvering it in the HR1-DP manually until the energy minimum was found. The resultant complex was subjected to energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation using the DISCOVER module. An 8.0 \u00c5 cutoff for the calculation of non-bonded interactions and the distance-dependent dielectric constant of 80.0 (aqueous solvent) and non-bonded distance cutoff of 20 \u00c5 were used throughout the energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation. Initially, the complex was minimized for 5,000 iterations of steepest descent energy minimization. The resulting structure was then used as a starting point for sampling conformational space using molecular dynamics. The energy-minimized complex was equilibrated at 300 K for 10 ps. Following this, a 100 ps dynamics simulation was carried out at the same temperature, and the structure was sampled at steps of 1 fs. The sampled structure was subsequently energy-minimized using conjugate gradient minimization. Ultimately, the total docking energy between ADS-J1 and HR1-DP in the energy minimized complex was calculated using the DOCKING module. van der Waals and electrostatic energies were included in the docking.",
