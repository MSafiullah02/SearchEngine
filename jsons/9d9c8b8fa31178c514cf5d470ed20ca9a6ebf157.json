            "text": "Previously, we demonstrated that a representative M genogroup type strain of infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) from rainbow trout grows well in rainbow trout-derived RTG-2 cells, but a U genogroup type strain from sockeye salmon has restricted growth, associated with reduced genome replication and mRNA transcription. Here, we analysed further the mechanisms for this growth restriction of U-type IHNV in RTG-2 cells, using strategies that assessed differences in viral genes, host immune regulation and phosphorylation. To determine whether the viral glycoprotein (G) or non-virion (NV) protein was responsible for the growth restriction, four recombinant IHNV viruses were generated in which the G gene of an infectious IHNV clone was replaced by the G gene of U-or M-type IHNV and the NV gene was replaced by NV of U-or M-type IHNV. There was no significant difference in the growth of these recombinants in RTG-2 cells, indicating that G and NV proteins are not major factors responsible for the differential growth of the U-and M-type strains. Poly I:C pretreatment of RTG-2 cells suppressed the growth of both U-and M-type IHNV, although the M virus continued to replicate at a reduced level. Both viruses induced type 1 interferon (IFN1) and the IFN1 stimulated gene Mx1, but the expression levels in M-infected cells were significantly higher than in U-infected cells and an inhibitor of the IFN1-inducible protein kinase PKR, 2-aminopurine (2-AP), did not affect the growth of U-or Mtype IHNV in RTG-2 cells. These data did not indicate a role for the IFN1 system in the restricted growth of U-type IHNV in RTG-2 cells. Prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites in the viral phosphoprotein (P) using the NetPhosK program revealed differences between U-and M-type P genes at five phosphorylation sites. Pretreatment of RTG-2 cells with a PKC inhibitor or a p38MAPK inhibitor did not affect the growth of the U-and M-type viruses. However, 100 lm of the casein kinase II (CKII) inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-b-dribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), reduced the titre of the U type 8.3-fold at 24 h post-infection.",

            "text": "Infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus with a linear single-stranded, negativesense RNA genome of approximately 11,000 nucleotides. The IHNV genome encodes a non-virion protein (NV) and five structural proteins including nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase protein (L) (Kurath, Ahern, Pearson & Leong 1985; Morzunov, Winton & Nichol 1995) . IHNV causes an acute disease in wild and hatchery-reared salmonid fish in North America, Europe and Asia (Wolf 1988; Bootland & Leong 1999) . Phylogenetic analysis of IHNV glycoprotein (G) sequences differentiated North American IHNV isolates into three genogroups, denoted as U, M and L (Kurath, Garver, Troyer, Emmenegger, Einer-Jensen & Anderson 2003) . There are general host preferences associated with the U and M genogroups. Most of the U genogroup viruses were isolated from sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum), and the M genogroup viruses were mostly from rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) (Kurath et al. 2003) . In addition, the U and M genogroup viruses show host-specific virulence in vivo (LaPatra, Fryer & Rohovec 1993; Garver, Batts & Kurath 2006) . While the U genogroup viruses are highly virulent to sockeye salmon but not rainbow trout, the M genogroup viruses are highly virulent to rainbow trout and not to sockeye salmon. Detailed studies comparing U-and M-type strain virus infections in rainbow trout (Pe\u00f1aranda, Purcell & Kurath 2009 ) and sockeye salmon (Purcell, Garver, Conway, Elliott & Kurath 2009 ) revealed that in each host, higher virulence was associated with more rapid virus replication to higher viral load and persistence, despite a strong host innate interferon (IFN1) response. However, the molecular basis for the host-specific virulence difference of the U and M genogroups is not known.",

            "text": "Based on numerous observations from phylogenetic studies and historical literature on IHNV (Kurath et al. 2003) , we have previously hypothesized that the U genogroup in sockeye salmon represents the ancestral IHNV host-virus association, and the M genogroup arose following a host jump into rainbow trout. A viral pathogen must overcome many hurdles to replicate successfully in a novel host. It must enter the host cell, replicate with the assistance of host factors and evade inhibitory host products (Webby, Hoffmann & Webster 2004) . Each of these stages may require adaptive changes in the pathogen. Entry of a virus particle into a cell is initially mediated by the interaction of a virus protein with its corresponding host cell receptors. Different viruses use various host molecules as receptors, some of which are more globally conserved than others. For example, arenaviruses, the causative agents of several haemorrhagic fevers, use the widely conserved a-dystroglycan protein as a receptor (Meyer, de la Torre & Southern 2002) . Coronaviruses, by contrast, generally show a restricted host range that is mediated by specific interaction of the viral spike protein with glycoproteins on the host cell surface (Holmes, Zelus, Schickli & Weiss 2001) . For rhabdoviruses, the viral G protein is the only viral protein on the external surface of virions, and it mediates attachment to cellular receptors. In the well-studied mammalian rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), two major serotypes, New Jersey (VSNJV) and Indiana (VSIV), have been described based on neutralizing antibodies to the surface glycoprotein (G) (Cartwright & Brown 1972) , and these serotypes differ in virulence for swine (Bridges, McCluskey, Salman, Hurd & Dick 1997) . By using recombinant VSV viruses that differed only in their G genes, Martinez, Rodriguez, Jimenez, Pauszek & Wertz (2003) demonstrated that the G protein was a determinant of VSV virulence in this natural host.",

It is reported that phosphorylation of the VSV P protein by a host casein kinase II (CKII) is required for regulating RNA synthesis (Barik & Banerjee 1992) and that mutations altering the phosphorylation of the P protein affect RNA transcription or RNA genome replication (Das & Pattnaik 2004) . Besides CKII, protein kinase B (PKB) is reported to play a critical role in viral RNA synthesis of nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA viruses by phosphorylation of P protein (Sun, Fuentes, Timani, Sun, Murphy, Lin, August, Teng & He 2008) .",

Secreted IFNs stimulate susceptible cells to express more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose concerted action leads to limiting further viral growth and spread (Biron & Sen 2001; Sadler & Williams 2008) . The myxovirus resistance gene Mx, the PKR protein kinase stimulated by dsRNA and the 2\u00a2-5\u00a2 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) are among the best characterized ISGs with antiviral activity (Biron & Sen 2001) . Viruses would not replicate successfully in a host if they had not evolved efficient escape strategies allowing them to evade the host IFN response. It is becoming increasingly clear that IFN antagonistic properties can determine viral virulence in a given host (Webby et al. 2004) . Strategies used by viruses to suppress IFN production, to downmodulate IFN signalling and to block the action of antiviral effector proteins have been reported (Haller et al. 2006; Haller, Kochs & Weber 2007) . In the case of VSV, virally produced dsRNA plays a crucial role in inducing an antiviral state in virusinfected cells (Ostertag, Hoblitzell-Ostertag & Perrault 2007) . VSV M protein is reported to suppress the IFN gene expression through inactivation of transcription factor II D (Ahmed, McKenzie, Puckett, Hojnacki, Poliquin & Lyles 2003) . However, once IFN signalling establishes an antiviral state, VSV replication is inhibited by IFNs at multiple stages of infection (Trottier, Palian & Reiss 2005) . VSV grows readily to high titres in PKR-null cultured cells, which suggest that protein kinase R (PKR) plays a critical role in limiting VSV replication (Balachandran, Roberts, Brown, Truong, Pattnaik, Archer & Barber 2000) .",

The growth difference between the U-and M-type IHNV viruses was correlated with a difference in viral RNA synthesis in RTG-2 cells. In this study, we further investigated the molecular basis for the growth difference between the U-and M-type viruses in RTG-2 cells. Our data suggest that a specific host protein kinase is required for IHNV replication, possibly for viral RNA synthesis. We hypothesize that during the adaptation to rainbow trout as a new host, the M genogroup virus developed a requirement for different host protein kinases to achieve optimal growth, and different host protein kinase requirements are at least partially responsible for the different growth of U-and M-type IHNV in RTG-2 cells.",

Recombinant viral progeny of the full-length clone pIHNV was designated rI-HNV. To generate chimeric recombinant viruses, coding regions (open reading frames, ORFs) of the G and NV genes of the U-and M-type IHNV strains were amplified by RT-PCR from RNA extracted from infected EPC cells. RT-PCR was performed with primers as follows: G U : GAGCAG AGGTGAAGACTAGA, GATAAGTAACTTGC CACTGC; G M : CACGTAAAGTACCAGGTC ATC, ACACACCCACAGTATCACT; NV U : AG TGAGCAGGAAGACTC, GGTAGGAGCTATG GCGACT; NV M : AGTGAGCAGGAAGACTC, GGTAGGAGCTATGGCGACT. Unique SpeI and SmaI restriction enzyme sites surrounding the G or NV ORFs of pIHNV were created by sitedirected mutagenesis with the Quick Change kit (Stratagene). The entire G ORF of pIHNV was deleted by SpeI-SmaI digestion and replaced with amplified DNA fragments containing the G U or G M ORFs to generate pIHNV-G U or pIHNV-G M. Similarly, the entire NV ORF of pIHNV was deleted and replaced with DNA fragments containing the NV U or NV M ORFs to generate pIHNV-NV U or pIHNV-NV M, respectively (Fig. 1a) . The presence and position of the inserted genes were confirmed by RT-PCR and restriction enzyme analysis, and sequencing of the inserted sites in the plasmids. Recombinant viruses were recovered from EPC cells as previously described (Biacchesi et al. 2000) . Briefly, EPC cells were infected with the vaccinia virus recombinant that expresses T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7-3) (Fuerst, Niles, Studier & Moss 1986 ) and transfected with the full-length cDNA clones and three support plasmids that expressed the N, P and L proteins required for RNA encapsidation and replication. Infectious viruses were recovered from the supernatant medium and amplified by passage on EPC cells at low MOI. Recombinant viral progeny from cells transfected with the clones pIHNV-G U , pIHNV-G M, pIHNV-NV U or pIHNV-NV M were designated rIHNV-G U , rIHNV-G M, rIHNV-NV U or rIHNV-NV M , respectively.

The results showed five potential predicted phosphorylation sites for PKC, CKII or p38MAPK (Thr 53, Ser 149, Thr 200, Thr 213 and Thr 221) that differed between the U and M viruses (Fig. 4a) .

Although the function of the IHNV NV protein is not clearly understood, it is possible that the NV proteins from the U-and M-type viruses possess different capabilities for downregulation of the host immune system, leading to their different growth in RTG-2 cells. Here, we tested whether NV is responsible for the different growth between U-and M-type viruses in RTG-2 cells by using chimeric recombinant IHNVs that express NV of U-type or M-type within the same genomic background. However, the growth of these two recombinant viruses was not significantly different in RTG-2 cells, which means that NV does not play a key role in the difference in growth between U-and M-type IHNVs.",

Viruses, in turn, have evolved multiple strategies to block or evade the induction of interferon and also ISGs, which would otherwise suppress virus growth early in infection (Haller et al. 2006) . Recently, IFN genes have been identified in a number of species of teleost fish including rainbow trout (Robertsen 2006) . To determine whether antiviral activities induced by the IFN system can block the growth of the U-and M-type viruses differently, cells were treated with poly I:C, a dsRNA homologue that induces a strong IFN response in rainbow trout. Poly I:C pretreatment of cells 24 h before infection induced the expression of the IFN and Mx1 genes and blocked the growth of both U-and M-type viruses in RTG-2 cells. However, the inhibitory effects of poly I:C pretreatment on the growth of Uor M-type viruses were different; while the growth of U type was completely blocked by poly I:C pretreatment until 72 h p.i., the M type grew steadily, although more slowly, and reached a titre that was only 10-fold less than that of the untreated control infections at 72 h p.i. Thus, the antiviral activities induced by poly I:C blocked the growth of both U-and M-type viruses at the early stage of virus infection, but the U type was more severely restricted. This suggests that the M type, but not the U type, has some mechanisms to withstand the antiviral activities induced by poly I:C and can continue to grow in IFN1-induced RTG-2 cells. This may be reflective of the higher titres reached by M-type virus in the absence of poly I:C stimulation, and/or it could be that the slower growth of the U-type virus allows the host more time to mount an effective antiviral response. After 72 h, the U type began to grow, presumably owing to waning of the strong poly I:C-induced IFN1 response. Eventually, the U type reached a titre equivalent to the M-type virus at 192 h p.i., probably due to extensive cell death in the M-type infections at that time as reported previously (Park et al. 2010) .",

If this is true, we would expect the M-type virus to more effectively block the IFN1 response, facilitating its higher growth. However, several lines of evidence showed that the growth restriction of the U type was not caused by induction of a higher level of IFN or ISGs: (1) M-type virus induced more up-regulation of IFN1 and Mx1 gene expression than U-type virus in RTG-2 cells; (2) M-type-infected cells produced a higher level of IFN1 activity in cell culture supernatant relative to U-type-infected cells, as indicated using RTG-P1 cells; (3) the PKR inhibitor did not exert any effects on the growth of either the U or M type. These results were somewhat unexpected, as IFNs, Mx and PKR are well known to have antiviral activities and suppress the growth of viruses, including the fish rhabdovirus VHSV (Haller et al. 2006; Tafalla, Sanchez, Lorenzen, DeWitte-Orr & Bols 2008) . Our data revealed that poly I:C treatment before virus infection induced a high level of IFN1 and Mx1 and limited production of both U-and M-type viruses. However, when cells were treated with poly I:C after virus infection, there was no effect on the growth of either of the U-or M-type strains. Given that IFN1 is usually induced after virus infection, any effect of the poly I:C treatment post-infection would have been in addition to the IFN1 induced by the viruses themselves. Nevertheless, conventional antiviral activity induced by IFN1 does not appear to be a major factor responsible for the difference in growth between U-and M-type viruses in RTG-2 cells.",

Previously, we reported that expression levels of viral mRNA and genome RNA of the U-type virus were significantly reduced compared with those of M type in RTG-2 cells (Park et al. 2010) . Until now, regulation mechanisms of IHNV RNA synthesis have not been well studied. However, work with the mammalian rhabdovirus VSV revealed that viral RNA synthesis is carried out by two RNA polymerase complexes; a complex of the viral L and P proteins for transcription and a complex of viral L, P and N proteins for replication (Gupta, Shaji & Banerjee 2003; Qanungo et al. 2004) . Both viral transcription and replication are affected by phosphorylation of viral P protein by host kinases (Barik & Banerjee 1992; Das & Pattnaik 2004; Sun et al. 2008 ). If P proteins of the U and M genogroups differ in phosphorylation sites and, thus, require different protein kinases for their activation, the growth of U and M strains could be controlled by specific protein kinases of host cells. Using the NetPhosK server (Blom et al. 2004 ), we predicted differences in five kinase-specific phosphorylation sites in the P proteins of the U-and M-type IHNV strains; three PKC, one CKII and one p38MAPK phosphorylation sites. To determine whether any of these protein kinases are important for the differential growth of U-and M-type viruses, RTG-2 cells were pretreated with specific inhibitors against these protein kinases and viral growth was analysed. It is not certain whether protein kinase inhibitors used in this study are effective against kinases of RTG-2 cells. However, several reports have confirmed the inhibitory effects of protein kinase inhibitors, including the p38MAPK inhibitor used here, in trout and salmon (Lacroix & Hontela 2001; Ebner, Fiechtner, Pelster & Krumschnabel 2006; Hansen & J\u00f8rgensen 2007) . This suggests that protein kinase inhibitors are likely to inhibit enzymes in RTG-2 cells. We found that the PKC and p38MAPK inhibitors did not exert effects on the growth of either the U or M types, but the CKII inhibitor specifically blocked the growth of the U-type virus. Although we did not determine the phosphorylation of P protein after treatment of inhibitors, the specific block of growth of the U-type suggests that it requires CKII activity for its growth in RTG-2 cells, but the M-type may use a different protein kinase than CKII. We therefore hypothesize that P proteins of U-and M-type IHNV are phosphorylated by different host protein kinases that have different activities in virus-infected RTG-2 cells. This could cause a difference in RNA polymerase activities and result in different growth between U-and M-types.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results using recombinant viruses to assess roles of individual viral proteins showed that the G and NV proteins were not responsible for the growth difference between U-and M-type strains in RTG-2 cells. Studies of host innate immune responses showed that even though the growth of both U-and M-type IHNV was suppressed by antiviral activities induced by poly I:C, the U-type virus restriction was not caused by the induction of higher levels of IFN1 or ISGs, and the IFN1 system did not appear to be a major determinant of the growth difference. Finally, kinase inhibitor studies showed that a CKII kinase inhibitor significantly reduced the growth of U-type, but not M-type virus, in RTG-2 cells. These data suggest that host protein kinase is required for IHNV replication, possibly for viral RNA synthesis. We hypothesize that during the adaptation to rainbow trout as a new host, the M genogroup viruses developed a requirement for a different host protein kinase(s) to achieve optimal growth, and differences in host protein kinase requirements are at least partially responsible for the differential growth of U-and M-type IHNV in RTG-2 cells. At present, it is not known whether the CKII inhibitor blocks the growth of U-type through modulation of viral RNA synthesis and whether CKII activity is IFN1 dependent or not. These possibilities will be examined in future studies.",
