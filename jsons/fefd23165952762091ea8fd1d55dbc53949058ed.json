Patients and methods: A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed, and recording only those with a microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection detected using polymerase chain reaction, from January 2008 to December 2016. Results: A total of 110 patients were identified, of which 105 (95.4%) were less than 6 months old, and 59.1% were males.

This phenomenon coincides with the re-emergence of pertussis observed both in the United States and in other European countries due to reasons that are yet unknown; some of the reasons that have been proposed are loss of immunity over time, antigenic drift in circulating strains relative to those used to make the vaccine and lack of vaccination in certain subsets of the population. 9---13 In our region, between 2003 and 2010, the incidence in infants aged less than 1 year who required hospital admission only exceeded 100 cases in years 2003 (103 cases) and 2006 (204.5 cases). 6 Since 2010, the annual incidence of cases with hospital admission exceeded 130 per 100 000 inhabitants, with peaks of 365.0 and 425.0 cases in 2011 and 2015, respectively. However, in 2016 there was a decrease in incidence that coincided with the introduction of vaccination of pregnant women. This measure should be analysed in the long term to determine whether this trend is sustained, as it could also have been due to the data being collected in an interepidemic period. Comparing incidence data between countries poses significant difficulties due to differences in the case definition, the diagnostic techniques used and reporting systems. 2, 14 According to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, in 2014 the highest reported agespecific rate corresponded to infants aged less than 1 year, with an incidence of 51.6 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in Europe overall. Spain, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden were the countries with the highest incidence rates, with more than 100 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in this age group. 15 According to several studies, pertussis may be underdiagnosed, so its actual incidence could be higher. Basing the case definition on clinical variables could contribute to underdiagnosis, as such a definition is limited because signs and symptoms vary with age and vaccination status and also because physicians still maintain a low level of suspicion, especially in adolescents and adults. Recently, a research group proposed a diagnostic algorithm based on clinical signs and symptoms by age group. 16 According to this algorithm, pertussis should be suspected in infants aged less than 3 months if they present with coughing and coryza, especially in cases where the cough increases in frequency and severity, independently of its duration or whether or not it is paroxysmal, or infants presenting with leucocytosis and lymphocytosis. In our study, most patients presented with cough, accompanied by cold symptoms in 2/3 of cases, and most also had lymphocytosis.
