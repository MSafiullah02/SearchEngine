The sample was split evenly among tubes with 1.5 mL of LB medium +/\u2212 0.1 \u03bcM of the drug indicated in each experiment. The tubes were grown for another 2 hr at 37\u00b0 with aeration.

The remaining cells were plated on minimal lactose medium containing X-gal and IPTG (LacMinXI) and incubated for 2 days at 37\u00b0. For strains with high mutation rates and frequencies, serial dilutions of cultures in 1 \u00d7 56/2 were plated on LacMinXI. Mutation rates were determined using the Ma-Sandri-Sarkar maximum likelihood estimator through the FluCalc webpage (Radchenko et al. 2018). Mutant frequencies were also calculated and statistical significance (P < 0.05) was determined by paired sample t-test between untreated and treated samples. Specificity of the QP5 and QP6 reporters for only intramolecular template-switch events was confirmed as described in Seier et al. 2011. Colony PCR and restriction digests were conducted on 4 revertants of each strain exposed to no treatment or the various compound treatments (0.1 \u03bcM 5azaC (Sigma Aldrich), Novo (Sigma Aldrich), AZT (Sigma Aldrich), Enro (Sigma Aldrich), and Cipro (Sigma Aldrich)) from the mutation assay. For these reporters, quasipalindrome-associated template-switch mutations were characterized by the loss of EarI (QP5) or PvuII (QP6) restriction sites (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In addition, 2-4 revertants from each strain and treatment were sequence-verified (GENEWIZ, Inc.). The Lac+ phenotype, with and without drug exposure, was determined to be the result of an intramolecular template-switch event and not due to a different mutational event that restored LacZ function.",

The medium used in the screen allows Lac+ revertants to be visualized as blue, out-growing papillae on a faint white lawn. On one lactose X-gal papillation plate, 24 small molecules can be tested by adding each molecule to its specified filter disk. Only 5 \u03bcL of each drug was added to each filter disk to prevent crosstalk between drugs as much as possible, while still allowing proper diffusion. We use distilled water as a negative control and 100 \u03bcg/mL (409.5 \u03bcM) 5-azaC as a positive control. This concentration of 5-azaC was chosen since it has been shown to induce QPM with the disk diffusion assay (Laranjo et al. 2018). If a compound stimulates template switching, after one or two days, a blue halo around the filter disk containing the compound will appear. The presence of blue colonies is the result of the lacZ gene becoming functional after a template-switch event. If a compound does not affect template switching, the filter disk will appear the same as the distilled water negative control. If a compound decreases the rate of template switching, there will be a decrease in blue colonies around the filter disk compared to the negative control. Killing by the compound produces a zone of inhibition, a clear region surrounding the disk.",

One of the hits was AZT, which is a known mutagen of QPM and, therefore, supported the effectiveness of our screen. The 10 other small molecules were all the fluoroquinolones provided in the NIH Clinical Collection. All the hits increased QPM with the leading strand reporter, but only enrofloxacin (Enro) was found to increase template switching on the lagging strand. Various studies have shown that there is a strand bias with QPM (Rosche et al. 1997; Yoshiyama et al. 2001; Yoshiyama and Maki 2003; Seier et al. 2011). This could contribute to the lack of effect of 10 of the hits on the lagging strand reporter. Another possible explanation is that a higher concentration of each drug is needed to see an effect on the lagging strand. Unfortunately, the starting concentration of our library was 80 \u03bcM and, thus, it was not possible to repeat the screen at an increased concentration. Also, we did not find any small molecules that prevent QPM in this screen since we did not detect any compounds that decreased the background level of lacZ reversion.",

Novo is a type II topoisomerase inhibitor that does not result in DPCs in contrast to the fluoroquinolones. Therefore, Novo was chosen to see if the effect of the fluoroquinolones on template switching was due to the formation of DPCs or general inhibition of the type II topoisomerases. Novo did not cause an effect on QPM in this assay, suggesting the effect of the fluoroquinolones on template switching was due to the formation of DPCs. 5-azaC only showed an effect on the leading strand reporter at the highest dosage (100 \u03bcM). AZT, Enro, and Cipro caused a large increase in QPM on the leading strand and a mild increase on the lagging strand. The larger zones of inhibition caused by Cipro at 10 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM concentrations compared to those caused by AZT and Enro at those concentrations suggest that Cipro is much more bactericidal.",

Nal is a quinolone antibiotic and type II topoisomerase poison (Lesher et al. 1962; Peng and Marians 1993). d4T and ddI are antiviral DNA chain terminators like AZT and were previously found to stimulate QPM (Mamber et al. 1990; Seier et al. 2012).

Using the NIH Clinical Collection, we were able to detect 11 mutagens that stimulate template switching at a QP site. We identified the entire class of type II topoisomerase poisons, the fluoroquinolones, and AZT as potent mutagens for template-switching. Due to the lack of a mutagenic effect by Novo, the effect of the fluoroquinolones is likely to be the result of DNA-topoisomerase II and IV trapped covalent complexes. These results were validated with a small-scale disk diffusion test and fluctuation analysis. Small molecules that prevent QPM were not detected, but we aspire to discover these types of compounds as more chemical libraries are screened.",

Two other anti-HIV dideoxynucleosides, zalcitabine (ddC) and lamivudine (3TC), are found in the NIH collection and did not enhance template-switch mutagenesis. Previous work in E. coli has shown that AZT is significantly more potent at inducing DNA damage than the dideoxynucleosides (Mamber et al. 1990). Since AZT and the dideoxynucleosides must be phosphorylated to be active, it has been postulated that AZT might be a better substrate for phosphorylation than the other chain terminators in E. coli, which could explain the differences in potency (Mamber et al. 1990; Lavie et al. 1998).",

Nevertheless, this method is inexpensive and effective at discovering potent mutagens for quasipalindrome-associated template-switch mutations. Future directions involve repeating our screen with other publicly available chemical libraries. Our screening approach will also be applied to find mutagens that stimulate base substitution and frameshift mutations, using reporters already created for lacZ reversion assays (Cupples and Miller 1989; Cupples et al. 1990; Seier et al. 2011).",
