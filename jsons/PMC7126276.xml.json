Especially for the airborne epidemics, droplets produced by an infected person during his talk, cough and sneeze can cause surrounding individuals to be infected. In recent years, these epidemics had broken out for several times and spread widely. For example, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that emerged in 2003 brought a great disaster to the economy and human lives in China. Influenza H1N1 hit many countries in 2009 and led at least 12 220 people to death until December 30th 2009. In addition, common seasonal influenza would always affect human health as well.",

Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani  [1] studied the immunization strategy based on scale-free networks  [4], and the results indicated that protection of just a tiny fraction of the most connected individuals raises dramatically tolerance to infections of the whole population. Zanette and Kuperman  [3] researched the propagation of epidemics based on the Watts\u2013Strogatz (WS) small-world network  [5] under the action of immunization, and a similar conclusion that the most connected individuals should be protected preferentially was obtained. These two researches were both based on the unweighted networks with single hierarchical structure and the classic targeted immunization strategy was proposed in the researches. Targets in this traditional targeted immunization strategy are decided by evaluating their importance in the global network so we call it global targeted immunization strategy in this paper. However, social contact networks, on which epidemics spread among the crowd depends, always have overlapping qualities of clustering communities and hierarchical structure  [6], [7]. For example, the social network in a school consists of several class social networks, and different class social networks still have many links with each other. Furthermore, we find that global targeted immunization strategy loses its superiority in controlling the epidemic propagation in the social contact networks with modular and hierarchical structure. Therefore, it is progressively necessary to study the immunization strategy based on the modular and hierarchical networks and find a more effective one.",

In Section  3, the models involved in all the simulation experiments and the hierarchical targeted immunization strategy are introduced in detail.

In their researches, one infected individual transmits diseases to all individuals who have directly links with it at an equal probability. However, social networks only provide possible contact-objects. One individual would contact with different objects at different frequency and probability. Therefore, selection of immunized targets should consider the following two factors: One is the heterogeneity of links which can be measured by nodes\u2019 degrees. Because the more links an individual has, the more objects may be infected.
