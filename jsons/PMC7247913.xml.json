The start and progression of the pandemic varies between regions and countries, with some countries outside China currently making phased and tightly-regulated attempts to ease previously imposed social restrictions. However, many experts argue that this disease may be part of public life for many months to come, requiring a long-term plan to cope with a varying influx of patients and protection of healthcare workers while awaiting the development of effective pharmacological treatment [1, 2]. Therefore, radiology departments need to remain vigilant to cope with this pandemic for the near future.",

Some hospitals have even resorted to the expedited new installation of such dedicated CT scanners for the exclusive purpose of investigating (potential) COVID-19 patients [8]. If this is not possible e.g. due to a limited number of available primary scanners, other scanner types (e.g. SPECT-CT scanners or the cone-beam function of angiography suites) could be used as \u201cCOVID-19\u201d patient scanners for general purpose use. The objective would be to either divert (potentially) infected patients to a specific scanner as previously mentioned, or to increase capacity on other CT-scanners who are better suited for cardiovascular applications, depending on the local situation. Notably, all scan protocols on non-routine CT-scanners (e.g. SPECT-CT scanners) must be adapted to provide sufficient diagnostic quality, for which close cooperation and coordination with industrial partners might be helpful.",

Conversely, cleaning between scanning of two (or even more) established SARS-CoV-2 positive patients is not necessary unless (bacterial) superinfection is known, and local guidelines may differ. Currently, there are no universally accepted guidelines on how to clean radiology imaging equipment for SARS-CoV-2, although some centres have published their experience, proposing different methods and solutions for disinfecting the several components of CT and MR examination rooms [8]. Lists of disinfectants effective against SARS-CoV-2 have been published (https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2), while a solution of 62\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 min of possible contamination has also been suggested [11]. Additionally, several manufacturers have published equipment-specific guidelines for disinfection of their imaging equipment (Table 1). Down-time for disinfection between patients varies according to the local available resources and also on the targeted imaging equipment. The immediate availability of \u201ccleaning\u201d teams for scanners with mixed populations of SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients is advised to achieve maximum safety and productivity.",

A meta-analysis based on 4 studies with a total of 341 patients demonstrated a significant difference in cardiac troponin levels between subjects with severe and non-severe COVID-19 disease [21]. A main cause of high troponin levels and myocardial injury could be represented by acute myocarditis of varying severity. In a few cases the occurrence of myocarditis in COVID-19 has been reported but rarely associated with cardiac dysfunction. A recent autopsy study has revealed significant viral RNA in the heart (among other organs) exceeding levels of viremia [22]. This data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spreads of the bloodstream and can infect other organs. Additionally, myocarditis has been associated in the past with other coronavirus diseases as MERS [23, 24]. In a case series of 150 patients, 7% of deaths were reported as related to acute heart failure consequent to myocarditis [16]. Nevertheless, the exact relation between the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pathogenesis of myocardial damage is not fully understood and further investigation is necessary. Increased troponin levels could also be related to acute type II myocardial infarction (mismatch between oxygen supply and demand without unstable coronary artery disease) or to plaque rupture caused by severe inflammation (type I myocardial infarction). Such a relation between inflammation and cardiovascular events have been previously reported in influenza and in other coronavirus infections [25].",

Furthermore, as with every heavily diseased patient, COVID-19 patients could be more affected by side-effects of medication usually administered for cardiac-CT (e.g. beta-blockers).

To overcome this obstacle, this statement would propose a fast and focused CMR protocol for a comprehensive assessment of cardiac involvement in COVID-19. This protocol incorporates CINE sequences for functional assessment, oedema imaging for detection of acute myocardial injury and T1 mapping as well as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging for differentiation between ischemic and non-ischemic causes of myocardial injury. This protocol should be accompanied by fast, one breath-hold sequences for assessment of thoracic complications. All efforts to reduce acquisition time (e.g. use of accelerated imaging as compressed sensing or reduction of time delay for LGE imaging) should be used. A proposed imaging protocol is summarized in Table 3.",
