Up-regulated mir-21 enhances transcription of fibronectin (FN) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), but gene silencing of mir-21 inhibits collagen deposition and myofibroblast differentiation4. To study the role of mir-21 in lung fibroblasts, we enhanced the mir-21 level by transfection with mir-21 precursors (pre-21), and qRT-PCR analysis showed that mir-21 was increased significantly compared with pre-NC (control miRNA precursors) group (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of mir-21 inhibited apoptosis and up-regulated a-collagen I synthesis in lung fibroblasts (Fig. 1C,E) accompanied by increased p-ERK- NLRP3 inflammasome complex (NLRP3, Pro-caspase-1), Pro-IL-1\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2 protein levels, but decreased Spry1 protein levels (Fig. 1B,C). Conversely, U0126 and BAY117082 inhibited NF-\u03baB translocation, the protein levels of Pro-IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, NLRP3 inflammasome complex, and caspase-1 induced by pre-mir-21 (Fig. 1B,C,E), as well as apoptosis resistance and a-collagen I synthesis. Immunofluorescence staining showed that mir-21 induced co-localization of NLRP3 and caspase-1 in cytoplasm, which could be abolished by U0126 and BAY 117082 (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that mir-21 inhibited apoptosis and promoted a-collagen I synthesis by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome via the Spry1/ERK/NF-\u03baB pathway in lung fibroblasts.\n",

In 2012, Adam et al.24 reported that AngII up-regulates the expression of mir-21 in cardiac fibroblasts. To test whether AngII promotes mir-21 expression in lung fibroblasts, the cells were treated with AngII (10\u22127 mmol/L) at different time points, and the expression of mir-21 was determined. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mir-21 level increased significantly in a time-dependent manner after treatment with AngII. Consistent with our previous findings, AngII treatment inhibited apoptosis and promoted a-collagen I synthesis in lung fibroblasts (Fig. 2E,F). Furthermore, protein levels of ERK/NF-\u03baB and the NLRP3 inflammasome were increased, but Spry1 was decreased after AngII treatment (Fig. 2C,E). We therefore explored whether the effects of AngII are mediated by mir-21. Mir-21 antisense probes were used to reduce mir-21 expression level in AngII-treated cells (Fig. 2B). AngII-induced changes of protein levels of the Spry1/ERK/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and a-collagen I were restored by mir-21 antisense probes (Fig. 2C,E). Similarly, knocking down mir-21 inhibited the effect on apoptosis resistance of AngII (Fig. 2F). Immunofluorescent staining of NLRP3 and caspase-1 produced the same result (Fig. 2D). Thus, mir-21 mediated AngII-induced apoptosis resistance and a-collagen I synthesis in lung fibroblasts.\n",

It has been extensively researched and serves as a potential biomarker for diagnosing cancer and determining its prognosis27. Increasing additional roles28\u201330 in other diseases suggest that elevated mir-21 expression may represent a common feature of pathological progression, including fibrotic diseases. It has been reported that mir-21 levels are up-regulated in fibrosis of the kidneys31, heart32, liver9, and lungs7, and that targeting mir-21 therapeutically may have the ability to prevent development of organ fibrosis4. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that mir-21 is involved in the promotion of fibrogenic activation of fibroblasts in different organs2. Consistent with these results, we found that mir-21 l was markedly up-regulated in the lung of BLM-treated rats in vivo, and that over-expression of mir-21 inhibited lung fibroblast apoptosis and promoted collagen synthesis in vitro. As it has also been shown that the pro-fibrotic factors transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b233 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)4 promote fibrogenesis by up-regulating mir-21, we investigated whether other pro-fibrotic factors can activate mir-21. AngII, the principal effector peptide of the vasoconstrictor arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has a key role in the initiation and perpetuation of inflammation and fibrosis in experimental lung fibrosis34, and it is now becoming apparent that mir-21 is transcriptionally activated in cardiac fibrosis related to AngII32. Adam et al.24 have also reported that AngII up-regulates the expression of mir-21 in cardiac fibroblasts, resulting in their activation and atrial fibrosis. Thus, we propose that the pro-fibrotic effect of AngII may be associated with its augmentation of mir-21. Consistent with previous findings, we found that mir-21 levels were significantly increased in lung fibroblasts treated with AngII. Moreover, the effects of AngII in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting collagen synthesis can be reversed by silencing mir-21 in lung fibroblasts. In BLM-treated rats, constant infusion of exogenous AngII significantly up-regulated the expression of mir-21 and aggravated lung fibrosis. Hence, AngII-induced mir-21 promoted collagen synthesis in lung fibroblasts and exacerbated BLM-induced lung fibrosis.",

A number of signaling pathways have been identified as being involved in the fibrogenensis mediated by mir-21 in different organs, including PTEN/Akt, NF-\u03baB, ERK, TGF-\u03b21/Smad, and IL-13/Smad signaling pathways35. Ning et al.18 discovered that Spry1, an important target gene of mir-21, can inhibit the ERK/NF-\u03baB pathway, which is involved in liver fibrosis18. In this study, we have shown that mir-21 over-expression or AngII-induced mir-21 significantly increased p-ERK and NF-\u03baB nucleoprotein levels, but decreased the Spry1 protein level in lung fibroblasts. Moreover, mir-21 silencing inhibited the Spry1/ERK/ NF-\u03baB pathway activation. Collectively, we demonstrated that AngII-induced mir-21 mediated ERK/NF-\u03baB pathway activation by targeting Spry1 in lung fibroblasts. NF-\u03baB is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of a large number of genes, including the NLRP3 inflammasome.",

Furthemore, our previous studies have demonstrated NLRP3 inflammasome mediated AngII-induced pulmonary fibrosis in animal models. In accordance with these results, we found the NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 secretion axis was activated by AngII or mir-21 over-expression in lung fibroblasts, and that this can be reversed by anti-mir-21 probes. Thus, mir-21 has a potential role in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 secretion axis. However, how mir-21 exerts this effect remains to be elucidated.",

Li et al.41 consider that Ang(1\u20137) protects against experimental lung fibrosis by limiting the local tissue accumulation of AngII that occurs in response to BLM-induced lung injury, which is consistent with our previous studies. However, the precise molecular mechanism of the anti-fibrotic effect of ACE2/Ang(1\u20137) remains to be elucidated. We found that the effect of AngII-induced mir-21 was abolished by ACE2/Ang(1\u20137) in lung fibroblasts in vitro, and that exogenous Ang(1\u20137) infusion or lentiACE2 intratracheal instillation significantly decreased mir-21 expression and attenuated lung fibrosis induced by BLM in vivo. Furthermore, in primary lung fibroblasts, ACE2/Ang(1\u20137) suppressed AngII-induced ERK phosphorylation, NF-\u03baB nuclei translocation, and degradation of the targeting gene Spry1, and blocked AngII-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In exploring whether these responses of ACE2/Ang1\u20137 were mediated by mir-21, we found that activation of the Spry1/ERK/ NF-\u03baB pathway and the NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 secretion axis by over-expression of mir-21 could not be reversed by ACE2/Ang(1\u20137). Overall, these data suggest that mir-21 mediates the inhibitory effect of ACE2/Ang (1\u20137) on AngII-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting Spry1 in lung fibroblasts.",

AngII binds with AT1R in lung fibroblasts to enhance the expression level of mir-21, the recognized pro-fibrotic factor. Mir-21 promotes ERK phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB nuclei translocation by targeting Spry1 degradation, following NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The released proinflammatory factors (Caspase-1/IL-1) by the inflammasome pathway lead to a-colllagen I synthesis and apoptosis resisitance. ACE2 degrades AngII to produce Ang(1\u20137), which reverses the AngII\u2019s profibrotic effect via downregulating mir-21. As a result, mir-21 and NLRP3 inflammasome play a key in local RAAS imbalance induced lung fibrosis.",
