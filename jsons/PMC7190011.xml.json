In the past two decades two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov) and the coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-Cov),1\n2 have emerged in two separate events. They induced lower respiratory tract infection as well as extrapulmonary manifestations, leading to hundreds or thousands of cases with high mortality rates of up to 50% in certain populations. In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus, officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), was first isolated from three patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention,3\n4 connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases from Wuhan, China. Recent epidemiological reports have provided evidence for person to person transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 in family and hospital settings.5\n6 As of 28 February 2020, the number of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 has exceeded 83 652 globally, and more than 2858 have now died of covid-19, with the highest mortality rate of 4.47% in Wuhan. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 constituted a public health emergency of international concern.",

A recent study reported a 79.5% genome sequence identity between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov, and SARS-Cov-2 was 96% identical in terms of whole genome sequence to a bat coronavirus.7 Clinical and pathological features of patients with covid-19 have recently been reported, showing that the SARS-Cov-2 infection causes clusters of severe and even fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling that of SARS-Cov infection, associated with admission to intensive care units and high mortality.8 The first study of the initial 41 laboratory confirmed cases with covid-19 showed that 28 (68%) of 41 patients had been discharged and six (15%) had died.8 A larger case series involving 138 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 showed that 47 (34%) patients were discharged and six died (overall mortality 4.3%).9 Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological differences between patients who were and were not admitted to the intensive care unit have been fully evaluated. Given that the numbers of patients in these studies is relatively small, information about the clinical characteristics of patients who died is scarce. No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 has yet been shown to be effective, so supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and protects multi-organ function may be beneficial. Identifying or more promptly treating patients in high risk groups is crucial to decrease the mortality rate.",

Two target genes\u2014open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N)\u2014were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real time RT-PCR assay. Target 1 (ORF1ab) comprised forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA, reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA, and the probe 5\u2032-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3\u2032. Target 2 (N) comprised forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT, reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, and the probe 5\u2032-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3\u2032. The real time RT-PCR assay was conducted using a SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai Bio-germ Medical Technology company). The reaction mixture contains 12 \u03bcL of reaction buffer, 4 \u03bcL of enzyme solution, 4 \u03bcL of Probe primers solution, 3 \u03bcL of diethyl pyrocarbonate treated water, and 2 \u03bcL of RNA template. The RT-PCR assay was conducted under the following conditions: incubation at 50\u00b0C for 15 minutes and 95\u00b0C for five minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55\u00b0C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a cycle threshold value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). A medium load, defined as a cycle threshold value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.",

These resources were improved by early February, with prompt supply of medics and medical necessities from across the nation to Wuhan. ",

Thus, early vigilant monitoring along with high quality supportive care are needed in patients at high risk. It is notable that healthcare workers as well as close contacts of previously confirmed patients were likely to have a good outcome, which is consistent with the relatively low fatality rate (0.3%) reported in healthcare workers.18 This could be explained by the fact that in our study the median age of the healthcare workers was much younger than that of the remaining patients (data not shown). It could also be partly due to the lower mortality observed in the second generation of SARS-Cov-2 infection,19 as well as to the early awareness of potential infection in that scenario meaning that people would seek medical care or start treatment promptly. Furthermore, the time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was longer in deceased patients, as some of them had been in a critical condition before being transferred from other healthcare units to Tongji Hospital. This highlights the need to develop community awareness about prompt seeking of medical care and earlier referral to the intensive care unit for high risk populations.",

Deceased patients had persistent and more severe lymphopenia compared with recovered patients, suggesting that a cellular immune deficiency state was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, other common laboratory abnormalities in deceased patients included coagulation disorder (elevation of prothrombin time and D-dimer), impaired liver and kidney function (mild or moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine and frequent hypoalbuminaemia, haematuria, and albuminuria), electrolyte disturbance (hyperkalaemia and hypernatraemia), elevated inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and cytokine storm.

Development of respiratory, cardiac, and neurological complications is strongly associated with poor outcome in patients with covid-19. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Cardiac complications were frequent not only in deceased patients with cardiovascular comorbidities but also in those without cardiovascular comorbidities, suggesting that the high risk of cardiac complications in deceased patients could not be entirely ascribed to coexisting cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure could be major factors contributing to the fatality risk of covid-19 regardless of history of previous cardiovascular disease. However, the pathological report of covid-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome at present shows that pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation in the lungs, but no obvious histological changes in heart tissue, was identified from one single case report.20 This suggests that the underlying mechanism of cardiac injury needs further exploration. The median time from onset of symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 days, and the median time from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients was 26 days. In covid-19, the evolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in the first two weeks may determine the physiological progression (resolving or progressing) and outcome of disease (death or survival).",

Secondly, nearly a third of deceased patients developed disorders of consciousness on admission, ranging from somnolence to deep coma, which may result in a loss of some information (particularly a detailed history and subjective symptoms). Additionally, some laboratory tests (for example, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and arterial blood gas tests) were not done in all the patients, and missing data or important tests might lead to bias of clinical characteristics. Thirdly, the median length of hospital admission before death was about five days, information on the dynamic changes in laboratory variables in deceased patients was lacking, and the data collected for each patient on admission may have been from different disease stages.
