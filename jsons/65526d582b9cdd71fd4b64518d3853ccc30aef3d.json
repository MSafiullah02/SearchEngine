In 2014, 5 of the top 10 selling pharmaceuticals in the world were antibodies (Table 1 , [1] ). The majority of all biotherapeutics are produced in cultivated mammalian cells with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) systems manufacturing 60-70% of recombinant biologics on the market [9] . Mammalian systems are often preferred over other hosts, such as bacteria, plants, and yeast, because of their capability for proper protein folding, assembly and posttranslational modification. CHO systems have the added advantages that they can be grown in suspension at scales required to meet market demands; the cells have been genetically engineered to express high amounts of recombinant protein; the cells can be grown in serum-free and chemically defined media; and these rodent cells have less risks of propagating human viruses [10] .",

To keep up with demand while driving manufacturing costs down, mammalian cell production expectations are rising every year, with product titers reaching 10 g of protein/L of culture [11] . The high yields obtained today are the result of combined efforts made in improving host cells, expression vectors, screening methods, media optimization, and process development innovations. In this chapter, we outline the common methods applied to mammalian cell line development and describe the typical industrial processes currently used in cell culture and purification for the production of recombinant proteins.

CHO-derived cell lines are the preferred expression systems for biotherapeutic proteins although other systems have been used in the early days of the biologics era such as Sp2/0 and NS0 mouse myelomas, YB2/0 rat myeloma, and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. Recently, human-derived cell lines such as PER C6 and CAP were also developed for better posttranslation modification (PTM) and reduced immunogenicity of the biotherapeutic proteins. Numerous CHO-derived lines have been developed since the original Puck line of 1957 and the CHO-K1 cells which were derived over the course of the following 10 years from the same lab [12, 13] for an excellent history on CHO cell lines through the ages. In the 1970s and 1980s, Urlaub and Chasin used the Puck and Siminovitch lab cells to derive CHO-DXB11 and CHO-DG44 respectively. Figure 1 describes a lineage of the most popular CHO-derived cell lines. CHO-DXB11 and CHD-DG44 cell lines are engineered to have single or double knockouts respectively for the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene. Of note is the fact that human tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) was the first marketed biotherapeutic expressed in CHO cells and the CHO-DUXB11 line was used to produce hundreds of kilograms of protein.",

The basic schema is: Plasmids. The plasmid contains all genetic elements necessary for the expression of recombinant protein and for the selection of the cells generating the desired product. The gene sequences of interest are frequently optimized for codon and tRNA usages, GC content, ribosome-binding sequences, and removal of unnecessary secondary structure, which result in the improvement of recombinant protein expression. For stable cell lines with high expression level of the gene of interest, the plasmids must integrate into transcriptionally active chromosomal regions. The vector promoter elements drive the expression of recombinant protein and are derived from viruses, mice, and human. The strong murine or human cytomegalo virus (CMV) promoter is in general use, although the weaker simian virus 40 (SV40) and rouse sarcoma virus (RSV) promoters are also used. In general, the strong promoters are used for expression of genes of interest whereas weak promoters are applied for expression of selection marker genes. Another strong promoter from the highly expressed endogenous housekeeping gene, CHO-EF1\u03b1 (CHEF1) ( [19] ; ICOS, Bothell, Washington), has been generating CHO cell lines with high production levels. Also, the CR5 cumate inducible promoter has higher expression compared to CMV. The inclusion of a chimeric intron as an enhancer in the primary transcript leads to higher stable expression of recombinant protein through enhanced transport and processing of the mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it is translated [20, 21] .",

The selection system most commonly used in industry is DHFR or GS, which is present in plasmids when using DHFR-negative or GS-negative host cell lines, such as CHO-DG44 and NS0-GS/CHOK1SV GS Knock out respectively. In the GS systems, a knock-out of endogenous GS is preferred but not necessary as the use of MSX in culture provides selective pressure by inhibiting GS. The use of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element can facilitate the co-expression of selectable markers and protein product when integrated into the genome [22] . This system generates a single transcript accessible to ribosomes at two locations just prior to the start site of each gene. The fact that the selectable marker and the product gene are under the control of a single promoter, which generates one transcript, is likely to improve cell line stability. IRES elements can also be used for the co-expression of multicistronic peptides in a single transcript, which result in expression of multi-peptide proteins such as antibodies.",

Direct injection by micro-needle [30] , magnetofection by magnetic nanoparticles [31] , and electroporation [32] are examples of physical methods. The electroporation becomes a method of choice for industrial manufacture cell lines for biotherapeutics because of convenience and no intellectual property protection. Transfection efficiencies can vary from 5 to 100% depending on cell line and DNA delivery method.

The gene encoding the product of interest is usually co-amplified with the DHFR or GS genes as they are inserted into the genome in the same locations. Ten-fold or greater improvements in expression can be achieved with this amplification system. Gene-amplified cell lines tend to be more unstable.

AlphaScreen\u2122 (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts) is a homogeneous assay that is well suited for high-throughput quantification of protein production. The Guava easyCyte (EMD Millipore) microcapillary flow cytometer economically and conveniently generates fluorescence-activated cell sortinglike (FACS) expression profiles of cells with moderate throughput in 96-well microtiter plates. With this approach, clonal populations and cells with the highest average productivity can be identified. Systematic colony picking system from semisolid medium such as ClonePix was developed as an alternative high-throughput method. A critical element of generating stable cell lines is identifying clonal populations of expressing cells. Pools of expressing cells tend to express lower levels of desired protein; they can drift to lower expression levels, and are more difficult to adapt to serum-free suspension. Limited dilution methods have been used for years while FACS sorting of live cells has also proven successful. FACS can be used to simultaneously clone and enrich for the highest expressing cells [38] . Recent automated approaches for identifying clones include picking highexpressing colonies in semisolid media using ClonePix\u2122 (Molecular Devices, New Milton, UK), Pickolo\u2122 (Scirobotics, Kfar Saba Israel) and enriching for high-expressing cells by Laser-Enabled Analysis and Processing (LEAP\u2122, Inrexon). Recently, assurance of monoclonality of the manufacture cell lines is drawn into regulatory attention but no regulatory guidance is available. The best way to prove the monoclonality of the cell lines is to image the cell lines during primary screening process in order to demonstrate that the selected cell lines are originated from a single progenitor. The limiting dilution and the FACS-sorting under low cell density plating conditions cannot guarantee the monoclonality of cells and high-resolution imaging of the cells in microplate wells may be required to support the monoclonality. If the ClonePix is applied for screening, at least two rounds of cloning are required for assurance of the monoclonality of the cells. Single cellbased genome sequencing may be used to examine the monoclonality. For example, investigation of the integration sites of genes of interest on genome which is unique to each single cell may be able to determine the monoclonality of the cells.",

The DCB is used for the bioprocess development as well as for early material generation. For a small research program, only a small number of frozen vials may be needed. However, to continue to supply a cell line for the manufacture of therapeutic proteins, it is usually best to prepare two-tiered cell banks: a master cell bank (MCB) and working cell banks (WCB). A single cell line demonstrating suitable expression levels and stability is used to generate an MCB, and a WCB is derived from one vial of the MCB. Each MCB and WCB usually includes 100-300 vials.

For example, cell lines can lose their expression and can generate undesired proteins clipped from the product. Therefore, it is critical to characterize the cells to ensure consistency for large-scale production and to guarantee that the properties of the protein derived from the cells are maintained. For a production cell line, an acceptable level of stability of the desired characteristics must be established and a maximum passage number must be defined so that comparison of the cells' characteristics can be made after low and extensive passages. Tests such as peptide mapping, amino acid sequencing, DNA fingerprinting, and determination of gene copy number and phenotype markers must be conducted to ensure the cells' genetic stability. In addition, productivity and product quality must be examined to assess the stability of the cell line. A good production cell line should be able to maintain its productivity and product quality through the many generations required to reach the end of large-scale production. In most instances, stability retained for 50 generations will satisfy the rigors of large-scale manufacturing [39] . Conventionally, the cell line stability is assessed by monitoring change of volumetric productivity over extended period of time in culture; if the cell lines maintain their volumetric productivity greater than 70% of the original values, they would be considered stable cell lines. The cell line stability assessment may take up to 2-3 months and is a bottleneck for the cell line development timeline. If we are able to predict the cell line stability at early cell line development stage, we can speed up the cell line development timeline. Dorai et al. [40] demonstrated that the unstable cell lines were potentially identified by examining the secondary population peak by flow cytometry after internal staining of the cell lines with fluorescence tagged anti-capture antibody. The causes of instability of production cell lines likely vary but the loss of gene copies and the silence of genes by methylation are two of primary causes well studied.",

Just as mammalian cells are more complicated than microorganisms, the media required for their growth is also more complex. The medium must provide the same nutrients and growth factors that mammalian cells are exposed to in vivo in order for them to survive and proliferate. Serum contains many important components that support the growth of mammalian cells including growth factors, hormones, transport and binding proteins, attachment factors, protease inhibitors, and lipids. Serum was, therefore, a common media supplement in early mammalian cell culture and for large-scale production of therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies in the 1980s. However, the use of serum in mammalian cell culture has many disadvantages: (1) it is a potential source of bacterial, mycoplasmal, and viral contamination; (2) it is the most expensive single additive to cell culture media; (3) it has a high degree of batch variability, making production consistency difficult; (4) it contains a high concentration of proteins that can interfere with product recovery. In the early 1990s, these drawbacks, especially the serious concern about the risk of transferring diseases such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy from animals to humans, led to an important regulatory-driven trend to eliminate serum and animal-derived components from mammalian cell growth media.

Table 2 lists some SF media produced in the U.S. Many of these media are also made in powder form to facilitate use in large-scale production. As listed in Table 2 , there are different types of SF media, which can be categorized into protein-free (PF), chemicaldefined (CD), and animal-component-free (ACF) media. The relationships among these different types of media are illustrated in Fig. 2 . SF, PF, ACF, and CD media tend to be highly specific to one cell type and sometimes even to one particular cell line. It is not uncommon that a different optimal medium is required for a particular cell line. Development of SF, PF, ACF, or CD media requires considerable experience and expertise and can be very time-consuming. One approach is to start with a commercially available SF medium and add necessary nutrients to optimize growth and production for a particular cell type. This approach can shorten the timeline needed for in-house medium development. However, using commercial media has two major drawbacks: (1) commercial SF media are expensive, which can lead to a high cost of goods for large-scale production; (2) the composition of a commercial SF medium is proprietary to the medium company and the buyer will not know its formulation. This makes it difficult to gain full knowledge about how logical changes to it will affect the growth and production characteristics of a cell line. To fully understand the metabolism and characteristics of a cell line, there is no substitute for developing a media de novo.",

However, using similar methods to those detailed in the previous section, Ma et al. [48] and Huang et al. [50] were able to overcome this drawback. Huang et al.

Generally, the diameter of the impeller should be approximately one third to one half of the tank diameter. The lowest impeller should produce a radial flow pattern to aid in gas dispersion, and the upper impeller(s) should produce axial flow to eliminate \"zones of mixing.\" Paddle or Rushton impellers produce radial flow, and hydrofoils and pitched blade impellers produce axial flow.

However, due to the design complexity and the difficulty involved in cleaning and sterilizing membrane reactors, membrane aeration has limited utility in large-scale bioreactor systems. Sparger aeration offers high oxygen transfer rates and is widely used in both bench and production-scale bioreactors. Since oxygen is only sparingly soluble in water, a large surface area is needed to maximize diffusion of oxygen into the cell culture media. Frit spargers with micro-pores provide a large surface area for diffusion, but this type of sparger can cause foaming problems at large scale, and frit spargers are not effective removing dissolved carbon dioxide [54, 55] . Traditional large-holering spargers tend to have fewer issues with foaming, remove dissolved carbon dioxide more efficiently, and are easier to clean. Therefore, traditional spargers are often used in production-scale stirred tank bioreactors [54, 56] .",

Ideally, one would want online sensors to minimize the number of samples to be taken from the bioreactor and to automate the bioreactor process. Most bioreactors have autoclavable pH and dissolved oxygen (D.O.) electrodes as online sensors, and use off-line detectors, such as the Nova Flex or YSI 2950D analyzers, to measure other critical parameters such as lactate, ammonium, glucose and glutamine concentration, cell density, and carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2 ). An online pCO 2 probe is commercially available from Mettler-Toledo. Probes are also commercially available that determine viable cell density by measuring the capacitance of a cell suspension. Data from perfusion and batch cultures indicate that these probes are reasonably accurate at cell concentrations greater than 0.5 \u00c2 10 6 cells/mL [57, 58] . The accuracy of the capacitance biomass probes can be improved by using dielectric spectroscopy data [59] .",

Disposable bioreactors are now commercially available that are based on the use of presterilized plastic bags. There are two primary designs of disposable bioreactors, rocker motion bags and stirred tanks. For the rocker motion bioreactors, a sterile bag is partially filled with cell culture media and is then pressurized with a mixture of carbon dioxide and air. The bag is placed on a platform that rocks back and forth creating waves inside the bag. The wave motion provides sufficient mixing and gas transfer to easily support cell growth of over 20 \u00c2 10 6 cells/mL [60] . Currently, rocker bags are available in sizes up to 500 L culture volume and have been proven for the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production of human therapeutics. Rocker bioreactors have been primarily used as batch culture for inoculum preparation [61] and transient production; however, internal perfusion filters can be applied, allowing the option of use for highdensity perfusion culture. Stirred tank singleuse bioreactors are the other major class of disposable bioreactors, and are the most popular type of disposable production bioreactor [62] . Disposable stirred tank bioreactors usually consist of a cylindrical presterilized bag, supported by a stainless-steel shell, with either mechanically or magnetically coupled drive shafts turning axial flow impellers. The bag also contains either a drilled hole or a frit sparger, depending on the vendor, and an apparatus to insert autoclaved pH and DO probes or presterilized optical pH and DO patches. These patches contain a luminescent dye that changes color in proportion to changes in pH or dissolved oxygen. The color shifts of these dyes are detected using an external fluorometer [63, 64] . Disposable bioreactors are available in sizes up to 2000 L and have been shown to give comparable cell culture performance, titer, and product quality as stainless-steel bioreactors [65] .",

The cells are separated from the medium using a cell retention device and are returned to the bioreactor. The cell-free medium is collected for later protein purification. There are a variety of cell retention devices available, including spin filters, alternating tangential flow (ATF) filtration, acoustic separators, continuous centrifuges, and gravity settlers. Spin filters and, to a lesser extent, acoustic settlers are the two most commonly used cell retention devices for large-scale perfusion cultures [67] , and recently many new perfusion-based large-scale processes are using ATF filtration [68] . Perfusion cultures usually last several weeks, but require a longer time for process optimization, and more effort in bioreactor operation than either batch or fed-batch cultures. The increased effort is primarily due to continuous feeding/harvesting and fouling of the cell retention devices. The cell densities attained in perfusion cultures are usually on the order of 50-100 \u00c2 10 6 cells/mL [69] , and the product titer of the medium, in most cases, is lower than that from fed-batch culture [70] . However, the volumetric productivity is typically ten times greater than that of fed-batch cultures [70] . Since conditioned media is continually removed from the bioreactor, labile proteins can be separated immediately from cell proteases and other components that can cause degradation of the product. Some companies have explored the use of perfusion bioreactors in conjunction with novel purification schemes to create a continuous process, whereby the product is purified immediately after it is produced in the bioreactor [71] .",

            "text": "Shear Stress. Because mammalian cells lack a cell wall and are larger than bacteria, they are more susceptible to hydrodynamic forces, or shear stress. Several studies have investigated the effects of shear stress on mammalian cells [72] [73] [74] [75] . Many indicate that the action of the impeller alone does not decrease the viability of suspension-adapted mammalian cells [72, 75, 76] . Some bioprocess engineers in industry have observed a few cell lines that appear to be less robust, and anecdotally might have been damaged by the impeller. However, bubble rupture does cause sufficient hydrodynamic force to kill all the cells attached to the bubble [75] . The effects of bubble rupture can be greatly reduced by the addition of surfactants, such as Pluronic F-68. Pluronic F-68 renders cell to bubble adhesion thermodynamically unfavorable, so the cells do not adhere to bubbles [77] . However, Pluronic F-68 offers very little shear protection; cells rupture at the same level of hydrodynamic force regardless of the Pluronic F-68 concentration [78] . Cells attached to microcarriers, however, are very susceptible to shear stress and can quite easily be removed and killed by the action of the impeller [74] . pH Perturbations. As mentioned in Sect. 4, significant pH gradients within the bioreactor are common, due to inadequate mixing. Cell lysis occurs at extreme pH; however, even moderate deviations from the optimal pH may be detrimental. Osman et al. [79] found that pH values greater than 8.0 or less than 6.8 cause a considerable decrease in cell viability and a reduced culture time. Antibody titers increased when the pH setpoint was reduced from 7.2-7.3 to 7.0 [79, 80] . The best way to eliminate transient deviations from optimal pH is to improve mixing (reduce the mixing time); this can be achieved by increasing the agitation or aeration rate, adding baffles, or optimizing the impeller design or placement.",

            "text": "Catabolite Accumulation. Several byproducts of cellular metabolism accumulate during the course of a bioreactor run. Many of these catabolites, such as lactate, ammonia, and carbon dioxide, are detrimental to cell growth and protein production. Lactate is a product of glycolysis and lactate accumulation greater than 2 g/L tends to inhibit cell growth and increase glucose and glutamine consumption [81, 82] . Lao and Toth [81] pointed out the difficulty in completely decoupling the effects of lactate accumulation from the effects of increased osmolality (osmolality increases with increasing lactate concentration). For some cell lines, the effects of lactate accumulation can be mitigated by keeping glucose levels low, which can be achieved by optimizing media composition and feeding strategies ( [48, 83] , respectively). Other nutrient feeding strategies may limit lactate accumulation without limiting the glucose concentration in the culture [84] . In cell culture, ammonia is produced as a cellular metabolite and is converted from glutamine in the media through deamination. An ammonia concentration of 20 mM, and possibly less, can inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis, and alter glycosylation in certain cell lines [85] [86] [87] . The primary method of reducing ammonia concentrations in fed-batch and perfusion cultures is to optimize feeding strategies. Genzel et al. [85] showed that substituting glutamine with pyruvate can greatly reduce ammonia production.",

            "text": "Carbon dioxide is a product of cellular respiration. In mammalian cell culture, carbon dioxide and sodium bicarbonate are normally used to control bioreactor pH. Elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) hinders cell growth and protein production [88] [89] [90] . As with lactate accumulation, the effect of elevated pCO 2 is difficult to completely decouple from the effect of elevated osmolality [88, 90] . Generally, one can reduce pCO 2 by increasing the volumetric mass-transfer coefficient (k L a), typically by increasing the air sparge rate and/or the agitation rate [91] . Mostafa and Gu [92] were able to reduce pCO 2 in a 1000 L culture and nearly double the titer by increasing the sparge rate and using an open pipe instead of a sparger. Table 4 summarizes the effects of shear force, pH deviation, and accumulation of lactate, Temperature Shifts. Culture temperature is one of the primary control parameters in mammalian cell culture. As stated previously, most mammalian cells grow optimally at 37 C. However, reducing the temperature set point slows cellular growth rate and metabolism, extends the period of high cell viability, arrests cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cycle, and possibly reduces intracellular protease activity [93] [94] [95] [96] . By decreasing the temperature to 31-33 C, the period with high cell viability is extended for several days, leading to higher product titers. Fox et al. [96] and Bollati-Fogolin et al. [93] reaped the benefits of a cooler temperature without excessively extending culture time by shifting from 37 C to 32 C or 33 C, respectively. The temperature shift occurred toward the end of the exponential growth phase of the cultures, approximately 3-4 days after inoculation in a batch culture. Different cell lines and culture conditions may have different optimal time points for the temperature shift. However, finding the optimal time point is important and worth investing the time required. Operating cell cultures at a reduced temperature often increases the production of the target protein, but to avoid substantially increasing the culture time, the culture is generally started at 37 C, then decreased to 31-33 C at a predetermined time point based on cell growth.",

            "text": "In general, fed-batch cultures are initially operated in batch mode until a key nutrient(s) is exhausted. Then, a solution containing the nutrient(s) is added to the media. As mentioned in Sect. 4, the feed solution and feeding strategy should be optimized. A common approach is to use partial concentrates (i.e., 10\u00c2) of the basal media as the feed solution; typically, most of the salts found in the basal media are not included in the feed solution. The bioreactor is sampled at regular intervals and when one or more of the key nutrients (usually glucose and/or glutamine) are below a certain concentration, a precise amount of feed solution is added to raise the nutrient concentration to its setpoint. A useful rule for choosing the nutrient setpoint concentrations is that it should provide enough nutrients to support cell growth and product production while avoiding formation of toxic levels of catabolites due to excess feeding. Huang et al. [50] followed this heuristic and fed a concentrated amino acid solution based on the projected uptake rates of the amino acids from their platform processes. Another method is to determine which media components are depleted during the culture and add those particular nutrients to the bioreactor independently [97, 98] . Wong et al. [99] selected glutamine and glucose as key control nutrients, and used two feed solutions (glucose and glutamine solutions) to maintain them at specified concentrations. Using this strategy, they maximized cell viability and density while decreasing accumulation of lactate and other catabolites. Recent advances in proteomics and metabolomics have given researchers additional insight into the internal machinery of CHO cells, and could potentially lead to more targeted approaches to media and feed optimization [100] . Another common approach to nutrient feed optimization relies on the use of non-animal-derived hydrolysates, such as soy, wheat gluten, and yeast [49] . Hydrolysates are undefined, and variability between lots of the same type of hydrolysate is a concern [49] . The use of size exclusion filtration can reduce the lotto-lot variability of hydrolysates [101] . After a series of optimization experiments, based on statistical design of experiments, Kim and Lee (2009) were able to increase titer by approximately two-to three-fold using a mixture of soy, wheat, and yeast hydrolysates.",

The cells are separated from the conditioned media, the conditioned media is collected, and the cells are returned to the bioreactor. Perfusion bioreactors can be operated in a variety of modes. The simplest mode is to consistently remove a certain amount of conditioned media each day (i.e., one bioreactor volume/day) and replace with fresh media. This mode is relatively easy to control. However, as the cell density increases, the required nutrient level may not be met. Also, the protein product tends to become diluted in the collected supernatant [52, 87] . Another mode of perfusion operation is to remove relatively small volumes of media at a time and replace the volume with a concentrated solution of nutrients. This mode is similar to fed-batch bioreactors. One might think of this as a perfusion/fed-batch hybrid, and like fed-batch bioreactors, considerable effort goes into determining the optimal nutrient setpoint concentrations and the feeding strategy. Sophisticated analysis and control schemes have been developed for this type of perfusion bioreactor [102, 103] . A third mode of perfusion bioreactor operation attempts to maintain a pseudo-steady state cell density, after an initial growth period. Dowd et al. [57] employed an online cell density meter and was able to maintain a relatively constant cell density by altering the perfusion ratethe amount of media removed from the bioreactor. This mode of perfusion reduces the frequency of sampling and analysis required to maintain a set nutrient concentration, but requires a wellcharacterized online cell density probe and a well-calibrated pump control scheme. Warikoo et al. [71] also employed an online, capacitancebased biomass probe to maintain a pseudo-steady state cell density, but achieved the steady-state condition by keeping the perfusion rate constant while implementing an automated cell bleed. In other words, Warikoo et al. [71] would automatically discard a small amount of cell culture to maintain a predefined cell concentration.",

Over the last decade, a common purification platform has been developed using Protein A affinity resin as the capture step (Fig. 4, [111] ). Some process development-related attributes with respect to production of mAbs include: (1) significant increase in titer levels over the past two decades (from 0.5 g/L to 5-10 g/L); (2) high product requirement (as much as tons) due to higher doses of typical mAb products; (3) larger manufacturing facilities (from 1-5 kL to 10-20 kL).

It is often used for the whole cell culture harvest at or below 2000-L bioreactor scales due to its operational convenience and disposable design, and also commonly used following a primary harvest technique such as centrifugation because there is a practical lower limit to the particle size that can be removed by centrifugation technique. Depth filters have different pore sizes (0.5-10 \u03bcm) that can be used for primary depth filtration (using large pores) and secondary depth filtration (using smaller pores). In addition to removing particles by size exclusion, some positively charged depth filters can potentially remove negatively charged impurities such as endotoxins, DNA, and viruses by absorption. The major depth filter suppliers for Microfiltration is used in tangential flow mode by which cell culture fluid flows tangential to the micro-porous membrane and pressure-driven filtrate flow separates the soluble product from large particles. It requires thorough process monitoring of pressure, feed flow, and flux, and therefore is more delicate to use than normal flow filtration such as depth filtration and sterile filtration. The advantage of the tangential flow microfiltration is its ability to reduce the cell culture supernatant volume by concentration and perform buffer exchanges by diafiltration. Tangential flow microfiltration is best suited for cell culture solid load less than 3% packed cell volume due to the pressure limitation. At higher solid load, centrifugation is preferred for largescale manufacturing.",

The major advantage of the CaptureSelect\u2122 FcXL affinity matrix versus Protein A resin lies in its requirement of only gentle pH condition for elution, thereby retaining better biological activity and minimizing aggregation of IgG and Fc fusion proteins caused by low pH exposure. It has been observed that the salts in the low pH elution buffer are inhibitory of some hydrophobic minibody elution from CaptureSelect\u2122 FcXL column but can be counteracted by adding a small percentage of propylene glycol in the elution buffer [114] .

CEX offers many advantages such as high capacity (as high as over 100 g/L), long resin lifetime, and low cost. However, it requires a pH shift of the feed and a decrease of the conductivity before loading onto the column in order to optimize the dynamic binding capacity. CEX can be used for capturing antibodies and other proteins with a basic isoelectric point. Antibody variants such as charge variants and aggregates can be removed as well as most negatively charged impurities. The drawback of CEX lies in its relatively low selectivity, therefore lower product purity in comparison to affinity chromatography.

It functions similarly to packed columns, but in the format of conventional filtration modules, with symmetric microfiltration membranes functionalized with specific ligands attached to the convective pores. Diffusive pores are eliminated, mass transfer of biomolecules depends on convection, and the binding capacity is largely independent of flow rates. The most widely used membrane adsorber is the anion exchange membrane adsorber, which is usually used in the flow-through mode, and has essentially replaced the AEX column as a polishing method in antibody purification. The loading conditions for anion exchange membrane adsorbers are similar to AEX column. Impurities such as DNA, HCP, endotoxins, and virus particles bind to the membrane at neutral or slightly basic pH and low conductivity while the product flows through. The major brands of membrane adsorbers include Sartobind from Sartorius, Mustang from Pall, and ChromoSorp from Millipore.

Three complementary virus clearance mechanisms are generally designed into the purification processes: (1) virus inactivation by low-pH or detergent exposure; (2) virus removal through differential binding in chromatography; (3) virus removal through size-exclusion by nanofiltration.

It has been observed that some hydrophobic mAbs cannot pass through 20 nm viral filter at pH above 5 or conductivity above 15 mS/cm. Light scattering analysis has confirmed that these mAbs had increased hydrodynamic radius close to the pore size of the viral filter at neutral pH and above physical saline concentration. The underlining mechanism is reversible self-association, since these mAbs can pass through the same size of the viral filter after lowering the load pH to 4 and the salt concentration to below 50 mM. Lower pH renders the mAbs more positively charged thereby suppressing self-association.
