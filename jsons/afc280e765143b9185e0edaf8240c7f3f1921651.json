Clearly, for some patients ECT will be urgently needed and lifesaving. For others, ECT will remain essential because of clinical acuity or the lack of available options. For another group (mostly maintenance ECT patients and those presenting with less urgent clinical situations), and dependent on available staffing and resources, ECT may have to be postponed. During this time, it will behoove the ECT practitioner, with guidance from ISEN and the APA, to develop a framework on which to determine a hierarchy of need commensurate with local resources to perform ECT in the necessary and safest manner.",

These fall into several categories and reflect the lack of consensus at the healthcare system level, in general, and among some of our Anesthesiology colleagues, specifically, about the role and place of ECT in psychiatric medical practice. The categories comprise processes of care, resource allocation, treatment modifications, and patient and staff safety. While the majority of comments and recommendations reflect what is known about contact precautions informed by public health and infectious disease management principles, a few at the extreme reveal a disheartening lack of understanding about the ECT procedure from a safety standpoint and lack of appreciation for what makes ECT such an essential treatment. Consequently, when considered from the latter perspectives, the viability of this procedure, by maintaining sufficient access and providing necessary support and resources thereof, is threatened. It would appear then that some basic education could be a first step to confronting this bias.",

Communication (and education) early on is essential and identification of key stakeholders will support the recognition of the importance of access to ECT and what it will take to keep the service open.",

Further, policies developed without the input or knowledge of ECT Psychiatrists and mental health providers at the front lines may result in care processes or resource allocation decisions with adverse consequences due to the lack of complete understanding or deep appreciation of the unique role of ECT and the tremendous value of restoring function, maintaining quality of life, and, as we all can attest, saving a patient's life.(11)",
