            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a kind of single negative-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family [1]. It is the causative agents for both seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza, posing major public health challenges [2, 3]. The annual epidemics of seasonal influenza caused 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness worldwide. In addition, four influenza pandemics have been recorded since the twentieth century: the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, the 1968 Hong Kong flu and the 2009 swine flu [4, 5], leading to an estimated 300,000 to 50 million deaths worldwide [6, 7]. Recently, parts of highly pathogenic avian IAVs acquired the ability to cross the interspecies barrier causing sporadic infections in humans with high fatality rate, such as H5N1 [8], H5N6 [9] and H7N9 [10]. Vaccination and small-molecule antiviral drugs (such as M2 ion channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors) are considered the best options for control of influenza infection [11]. However, because of the easily occurrence of antigenic drift and antigenic shift, influenza vaccines need to be updated annually and the number of reports of drug-resistant influenza strains keeps increasing [12, 13]. Particularly, more than 95% of the current circulating IAV strains are resistant to M2 ion channel blockers [14]. The continued threat of epidemic and pandemic outbreaks and the limitations of current antiviral strategies underscore the urgent need for developing new influenza therapies.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of ~ 22 nucleotides (nt) small regulatory non-coding RNA that are conserved expressed by animals, plants and viruses [15, 16]. They were reported to play a pivotal role in gene regulation by repressing or degrading target mRNA [17] and participate in various cellular process, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, homeostasis, and tumorigenesis [18\u201322]. Recently, it has been found that miRNAs also implicated in the regulation of virus invasion [23]. Lecellier et al. [24] reported that miR-32 effectively restricted the accumulation of the retrovirus primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) in human cells. Huang et al. [25] reported that the 3\u2032 ends of HIV-1 messenger RNAs were targeted by a cluster of cellular miRNAs including miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223 and miR-382, contributing to HIV-1 latency. Song et al. [26] reported that miR-323, miR-491, and miR-654 inhibit replication of the H1N1 influenza A virus through binding to the same conserved region of the PB1 gene. Let-7c [27] was found to regulate influenza virus replication through the degradation of viral gene (+) cDNA by matching the 3\u2019UTR of the M1(+) RNA. Zhang et al. [28] reported that Sus scrofa miR-204 and miR-4331 negatively regulate swine H1N1/2009 IAV replication by targeting viral HA and NS, respectively. miR-127-3p, miR-486-5p and miR-593-5p were found to target at least one viral gene segment of both the human seasonal influenza H3N2 and PR8 (H1N1) virus [29]. miR-122 [30] is essential for hepatitis C virus replication in liver, and Lanford et al. [31] found that treatment of chronically infected chimpanzees with anti-miR-122 leads to long-lasting suppression of HCV viremia, with no evidence of viral resistance or side effects in the treated animals.",

However, the broad-spectrum antiviral property of miRNAs had not been studied before. Here, we developed a broad-spectrum antiviral miRNA screening strategy to screen cellular miRNAs that both effectively and universally inhibited the replication of IAV. miRanda software was used to predict the potentially bindings between all human mature miRNAs (2656 records) and all human IAV strains (28,124 records). Five cellular miRNAs that universally target PB1, PB2, PA or NP gene of IAV were selected. To determine the antiviral effectiveness of these miRNAs, the performance of inhibiting target viral protein expression and virus replication was evaluated. Finally, we found miR-188-3p, potentially targeting 99.96% of human IAVs, could effectively repress IAV (H1N1, H5N6 and H7N9) replication in infected A549 cells by targeting PB2 mRNA, suggesting that cellular miR-188-3p may be a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit IAV infection.",

Then miRanda software was used to predict miRNA targets with the parameters mentioned in materials and methods. Figure 1 depicts the flowchart in the present study. miRNAs targeting polymerase gene (PB2, PB1 and PA) and nucleoprotein (NP) gene were considered for further study, because the four genes were relatively conservative and important to virus replication. Targeting rate of each miRNA was defined as the number of IAV strains that can be potentially targeted dividing by the total number of strains. Five miRNAs with high targeting rate were chosen for further research (Table 1). miR-345-5p and miR-188-3p potentially bind to PB2 gene with targeting rate of 95.31 and 99.96%, respectively. miR-3183 potentially bind to PB1 gene with targeting rate 92.90%. miR-15a-3p potentially bind to PA gene with targeting rate 94.58%. miR-769-3p potentially bind to NP gene with targeting rate 97.24%.

However, the broad-spectrum property, one of the key parameters to be developed as antiviral agents, had not been determined. In this study, we combined bioinformatics analysis and bio-experimental verification to screen cellular miRNAs that both effectively and universally inhibited the replication of IAV. With this approach, miR-188-3p was finally identified, which potentially targeted 99.96% of the human IAV strains and effectively suppressed IAV replication by binding to PB2 gene in A549 cells.

On the one hand, PB2 might be a more suitable anti-virus target than PB2, PB1 and NP. Because PB2 was not only responsible for viral gene expression and RNA genome replication, but also implicated as a host range determinant and pathogenicity factor [41\u201345]. Therefore, miR-188-3p might not only inhibit the replication of IAV but also reduce the virulence of IAV. As shown in Fig. 5a, the two miRNAs (miR-188-3p and miR-345) targeting PB2 exhibited a more inhibitory activity than the other two miRNAs (miR-3183 and miR-769-3p) targeting PB1 and NP, which might confirm this speculation. However, this still needed further verification. On the other hand, miR-188-3p exhibited a better inhibitory activity on the expression of PB2 proteins under both plasmid transfection conditions and virus infection conditions than miR-345-5p (Figs. 4 and 5b).",
