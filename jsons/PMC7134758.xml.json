The Kingdom of Thailand also has its own system of traditional medicine which is called \u201cThai traditional medicine\u201d (TTM) and it had been a means of national health care for the Thai people until the early 20th century.3\n",

And yet, the modern development of these two medicines strikingly manifests a historical similarity: The spread of modern medicine from the Western world to the East led to a decline in the practice of traditional medicine both in Thailand and China. Based on a secondary analysis of available literature, this paper aims to do comparative studies between TCM and TTM, and concentrates on two crucial historical developments: (1) the response to, and consequences of, the impact of the Western medicine; and (2) the revival of traditional medicine in these two countries and its prospects. In this ever-changing globalization age, the practical significance of the comparison is to discover the objective laws of the development of TM, to fully identify the similarities and differences between the two medicines, to create a necessary platform for securing cultural sensitivity and enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation between the two countries.",

They are thought to be essential to healthy living and development of TCM. TCM originated from the legendary clan leader Fu Xi (2593 BC) period, established its theoretical system during the late years of the Warring States period to Chin and Han dynasties (475 BC\u2013AD 220).6 So t he Comprehensive academic system of TCM had been formed more than 2500 years. During the Jin and Tang dynasties (265 AD\u2013907 AD), TCM experienced great development and absorbed much medical information from Arabian countries, Japan and India. During the Song and Yuan dynasties (960 AD\u20131368 AD), the invention of printing technology and further advances in papermaking caused TCM to spread widely and to be deeply researched. During the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368 AD\u20131911 AD), every part of TCM was enriched and TCM spread to the countries of Europe and the Americas. From the beginning of the Opium War in 1840, China was continually defeated by outside forces. There were some Chinese people who, as a result of the national crisis, developed a cultural inferiority complex and produced a tide of complete opposition to their own culture. Western medicine took root, and Chinese medicine went into a hundred year decline.",

In addition, traditional knowledge of TTM was also built through the processes of \u201cselection\u201d, \u201cadoption\u201d, \u201cadaptation\u201d and \u201cutilization\u201d of traditional medicine of some countries with which Thailand had contact in the past, e.g., India and China, to suit the Thai way of life. TTM knowledge was gradually developed, systematized, revised, recorded, and passed on from generation to generation throughout the country\u2019s history, from Sukothai to Ayutthaya (1350\u20131767), Thonburi (1767\u20131782), and the early Rattanakosin period (1782\u20131916), as a means of health care for the Thai people. After Burma destroyed Ayutthya in 1767, Kings Rama I\u2013III of the present Chakri Dynasty played an important role in the revival of TTM. Over 1000 drug recipes and the body of knowledge of TTM regarding the origin of diseases and their treatments were gathered and inscribed on marble tablets and placed on the walls of two temples, namely Wat Po and Wat Raja Oros. The purposes of the Kings\u2019 orders were to compile collective knowledge of TTM that was partly lost or destroyed during the Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767) and to give health education to the Thai people so that they could take care of their health using TTM. Unfortunately, the influence of Western medicine, which was introduced into Thailand by missionaries and western physicians since the reign of King Rama III (1787\u20131851), gradually increased and eventually led to the abandonment of the systematic teaching of TTM in the medical school in 1916. This sparked the decline in TTM acceptance, especially among people in the urban areas, and the status of TTM practitioners in the country\u2019s health care system for over 60 years.",

According to TCM, people become ill because they do not know the laws of nature, of society, or of relations among people. So TCM aims for balances in three major aspects because all illnesses are caused by imbalance. This is rather similar to the Galenic medicine in ancient Rome and Greece. The three balances are balance between man and nature, balance between an individual and the society, balance between the functions of the body organs. TCM is a dialectical and dynamic system which integrates theories such as the theories of yin and yang (the positive and negative forces, they not only depend on each other and oppose each other, but also tend to transform and alternate in waxing and waning), and wuxing (the five elements \u2014water, fire, metal, wood and earth, the relations between them are inter-promotion, interaction, over-action and counter-action), and jingluo (Channels and Collaterals), of visceral manifestation, of treatment based on the differentiation of symptoms and signs, of pharmacology, of acupuncture and moxibustion, etc. The theoretical system explored in the earliest-extant Huangdi Neijing remains the mainstay of TCM up to this day.6\nHuangdi Neijing, the theoretical work on TCM that emerged in the Warring States Period (475\u2013221 B.C.), marks the establishment of Chinese medicine\u2019s unique theoretical system. Another classic work, Shennong\u2019s Herbal Classic sums up medical experiences prior to the Qin (221\u2013207 B.C.) Dynasty, records 365 varieties of medicinal herbs and it is the earliest pharmacopoeia ever found in China.",

            "text": "TTM, by contrast, is an integrated system of medicine incorporating the Indian derived Ayurvedic system and the Chinese system amalgamated with a deep-rooted belief in the supernatural, mystique and astrology.8 Buddhism has a great influence upon TTM and its many principles are used for medical analysis.9 However, the principal philosophy of TTM leans heavily toward the Ayurvedic teaching and Buddhism thoughts which are the attainment of equilibrium among the four basic elements, namely earth, water, wind and fire. These elements are called as \u201ctards\u201d in Thai language, which are the very essence of human life. In order to stay healthy, the four elements must be in perfect balance and harmony, and TTM seeks to restore health by overcoming imbalances in the system. TTM also states that everyone has one's own dominant element called \u201ctard-chao-ruan\u201d in Thai language, which is basically determined by the date and month of one's conception. The tard-chao-ruan of a person plays an important role with regard to one\u2019s characteristics and appearance as well as the weak point in one's health (Vichai and Anchalee).10 According to TTM, the seasons, age, geography, time and behavior can affect one\u2019s health as well. Illness can be caused by supernatural powers (ancestor souls, evil spirits, and punishment from spirits for misbehavior), powers of nature (imbalance of tards, imbalance of hot and cold, imbalance of body equilibrium), powers of the universe (influence of sun, moon and stars) and Kimijati, which is the equivalent of microorganisms or parasites.10 During the reign of King Narai the Great (1656\u20131688), the doctors that served the king united to compile a textbook of King Narai\u2019s medicines or Tamra Phra Osod Phra Narai, which was the first official textbook of Thai drug recipes. During the reign of King Rama V (1868\u20131910), the first medical textbook Tumra Paetsart Sonkrau and the first Thai national formulary called Tumra Paetsart Sonkhrau Chabub Luang as well as Tumra Vejasuksa, the first TTM textbook for medical students, were published. They are still official textbooks of TTM accepted by the Thai Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the registration of traditional medicines.",

Observation is the method to see the patient\u2019s expressions, complexion, physique, posture, tongue and the fur on it and the color of secretion and excrement in order to know the situation of the internal organs. Auscultation and olfaction are the method to listen to the patient\u2019s sounds and to smell the odor of his/her breath and discharge. The change of his/her sounds through his/her talking, breathing and coughing and his/her odor can tell chills, fever, hypo function and hyper function. Interrogation is the method to inquire the patient or his/her companions about the onset, the cause and course of the illness, the chief complaints (especially pain), the past history, the living habits and other relevant conditions. As to palpation, pulse feeling is the chief item.2\nBagang (eight principles) are important principles of treatment of TCM. They are yin and yang, exterior and interior, cold and heat, deficiency and excess. In spite of the complexity of diseases, they could be basically summed up into bagang. Of bagang, yang includes exterior, heat and excess while yin covers interior, cold and deficiency. Whenever there is a correct analysis of bagang, there will be precise diagnosis and a satisfactory treatment.6 Last but not least, TCM puts emphasis on \u201ccuring illnesses that have not yet happened rather than curing illness\u201d. Guan Qingwei, the director of Tongrentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic stated that by improving people\u2019s health at the \u201cpre-illness\u201d stage, TCM helps people avoid illness in the first place and when illness does come, TCM will stop it from becoming worse or cure it.11 During its long practice and evolvement, TCM has developed a complete and independent theoretical system and unique and effective methods of clinical treatment centering on Chinese herbal medicines, supplemented by acupuncture and moxibustion, medical massage and qigong, that is, deep breathing exercises.",
