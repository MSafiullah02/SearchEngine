A newly isolated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was found to be the etiological agent of SARS (Drosten et al., 2003), and the genome of the virus was soon sequenced (Marra et al., 2003). The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV have subsequently been pursued in several laboratories. It is of great importance to identify the characteristics of host antibodies against SARS virus and its components, to aid in vaccine development and diagnosis of the viral infection (Chen et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003).",

Serial serum samples were collected at 7\u2013210 days after the onset of symptoms, and were subjected to antibody analysis. Anti-viral antibodies (IgG, IgM) were assayed by indirect fluorescence (IF) kits developed by Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology and approved by State Drugs Administration of China (Si et al., 2003). 20 \u03bcl diluted sera (1:20 or greater dilution) were added onto slides containing monolayers of SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells and non-infected Vero cells as a negative control. The slides were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, washed three times with PBS (phosphate buffered saline), and then FITC-labeled anti-human IgG or FITC-labeled anti-human IgM were added for 30 min. The slides were washed as before, and fluorescence was detected with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope. The dilution for cut off is 1:20. Anti-nucleocaspid (N protein, NP) total Ig was assayed by an antigen-capturing ELISA (AC-ELISA) co-developed by Sina-American Biotechnology Co. Ltd. and Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Shi et al., 2003). For this assay, 100 \u03bcl of serum samples were added to wells coated with recombinant N protein, the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, and then washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. 100 \u03bcl HRP (Horse radish peroxidase)-conjugated N protein was added and the plate was incubated for another 30 min followed by washing as above. Then 100 \u03bcl of TMB substrate solution (0.1 mg/ml tetramethylbenzidine hydrochloride, 0.01% H2O2 in 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 5.8) was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min, The reaction was terminated by adding 50 \u03bcl 2 N sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined. The maximum dilution of the serum at which a positive signal was obtained (IFA), or an absorbance at 450 nm wavelength greater than 0.15 (cutoff value) was given, was defined as antibody titer. The data were analyzed by SPSS11.0 software and the geometric means of seropositive samples were employed in all statistics.",

Then the mixture was aliquotted to 8 wells (200 \u03bcl each) of Vero E6 cell monolayers grown in 96-well microtiter plates. The plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 7 days.

By comparison, anti-viral IgG and anti-N protein antibodies were detected in all the patients from 30 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms. Antiviral IgM was shown to be negative in 4, 8, 12 and all 14 patients by day 60,120,180 and 210 days post disease onset, respectively.
