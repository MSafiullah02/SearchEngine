Defaulting on private debt is highly visible and hence more likely to result in a rating downgrade, while an official default is generally much less visible and hence less likely to determine some negative spillovers. 4 In particular, official restructurings that are arranged within the ''Paris club umbrella'' are supposed to guarantee a relatively smoother approach to the way in which deals are orchestrated than private ones, thereby lowering even further the collateral damage of a default. 5 Hence, sovereign debtors, being aware that the consequences of a default may depend on who the defaulted creditors are, may decide to prioritize their repayments accordingly. Documenting this difference can then help to shed light on why countries default towards whom and why.",

First, this index can be regarded as a continuous variable, while the credit ratings assigned by the rating agencies have the features of a discrete variable.

For each defaulter, the pool of potential control units encompasses no-defaulters for which data are available.

Considering eight years after the event (which corresponds to the average private crisis duration in this sample), the gap in rating between private defaulters and their synthetic counterpart is, on average, about 40 percent, which is clearly an economically relevant magnitude. Note that the dotted line in Fig. 4 denotes the beginning of the debt crisis (i.e., the time of default), which explains why the average rating decline is so massive before to the final restructuring, which is our main event of interest in the paper and can take years after the default occurs. 11 Conversely, in the case of an official default, while we observe, on average, a contraction in Investor's rating during the years of the crisis (the average duration is eleven years in this case), official defaulters do catch up with their synthetic counterpart in its aftermath. 12 In summary, consistently with the results obtained from the regression analysis, we find that while private defaults generate rating contraction which is persisting over time, official defaulters do not show a permanent drop in Investor's rating. 13 11 As a robustness check, we have calculated the average drop in ratings for private defaulters both at the start and at the end of the default episodes. We document that the average rating decline is much larger at the beginning than at the end. Results would be available on request. 12 Note that while for private defaulters we are able to use the exact date of the default (as in Asonuma and Trebesch, 2016) , in the case of official default, the dotted line refers to the date of the first restructuring, which is the only information we can obtain for official debt crises. 13 These results are consistent with Marchesi and Masi (2020a) , who used the SCM, to investigate the heterogeneous response of GDP per capita to private and official default. They find that while private defaulters are not able to recover their output losses in the medium-long run, official defaults do not have an impact on defaulters' GDP per capita.",
