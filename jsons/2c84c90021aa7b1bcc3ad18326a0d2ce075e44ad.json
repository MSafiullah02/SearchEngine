The matching of skin pigmentation to background colour can be genetically determined (defined here as \"background matching\"), or induced by physiological plasticity through differential secretion of hormones by neuroendocrine systems (\"background adaptation\") (Baker & Bird, 2002; Hoekstra, 2006 ). An example of genetically based background matching are mutations that produced a hyperactive melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r), the main receptor for \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) (Robbins et al., 1993) . The emergence of genetic polymorphisms in Mc1r expressed by pigment cells, and the selection of standing genetic variations, resulted in adaptive evolution of background matching in populations of reptiles, birds and mammals (Linnen et al., 2013; Price & Bontrager, 2001; Rosenblum, Hoekstra, & Nachman, 2004) .",

            "text": "The existence of a second hormone secreted from the pars nervosa of the pituitary, with opposite effects on background adaptation to \u03b1-MSH, was suggested initially by Hogben and Slome (1936) in their \"dual-hormonal control\" theory. MCH is processed from the C-terminal end of the preprohormone PMCH ( Figure 1 ). In fish, an \"MCH\" peptide is produced in the hypothalamus and transported down axons to be secreted from the neurohypophysis upon stimulation (Baker & Bird, 2002; Enami, 1955; Kawauchi, 2006; Kawauchi, Kawazoe, Tsubokawa, Kishida, & Baker, 1983) (Figure 1 ). The ability to adapt to a white background by aggregating melanosomes associates with the synthesis and secretion of an \"MCH\" in several teleost species (Gr\u00f6neveld, Balm, Martens, & Wendelaar Bonga, 1995a; Kishida, Baker, & Eberle, 1989; Mizusawa et al., 2012; Sugimoto, F I G U R E 2 Zebrafish and Xenopus both background-adapt but only in zebrafish do MCHL+ neurons project axons to the pituitary. (a) Schematic of the genomic structure of the three-exon pmch and one-exon pmchl genes, the mRNAs, the prehormones and the aligned a.a. sequence of MCH and MCHL. The two cysteines involved in the disulphide bonds in MCH and MCHL are indicated in red, and a.a. identity in green, while the predicted dibasic peptide at the cleavage site (RR) is underlined. (b) Quantification of the pigmentation index (left) and dorsal pictures of the head (right) from zebrafish and frog larvae developed for 5 days with a white (WB) or a black (BB) background. Bars indicate average (normalized to WB) from two independent experiments (n = 10; N = 2; \u00b1SE; *p < 0.05, ANOVA). Bottom right panels are enlargements of the red squares. (c) FISH against pmch and pmchl followed by immunohistochemistry against MCH/MCHL. Transverse brain sections (12 \u00b5m) processed for FISH (red; white arrows) and with a polyclonal anti-human MCH antibody (green) that recognizes both MCH and MCHL. Note MCH immunoreactivity surrounding the pituitary (P) in zebrafish but not Xenopus. pmchl+ neurons project their axons to the pituitary in fish (yellow arrows), while the axons of pmch+ neurons from both species project dorsally and are restricted to the brain (hypothalamus areas) Nagamori, Yasui, & Oshima, 1997) . Thus, a dual-hormonal control of regulation by \u03b1-MSH and an MCH with \"hormonal status\" may exist in fish. MCH can also act as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator to regulate physiological processes associated with feeding and energy homoeostasis (Amano & Takahashi, 2009; Ludwig et al., 2001; Matsuda et al., 2007) . The fish MCH system differs from that in mammals with regard to the hormonal status of MCH and the presence of two genes, pmch and pmchl, with distinct genetic structures (Berman, Skariah, Maro, Mignot, & Mourrain, 2009 ). The single PMCH gene of mammals and birds contains three exons and encodes a prohormone that generates an MCH that acts as a neurotransmitter (Breton, Presse, Hervieu, & Nahon, 1993; Cui et al., 2017; Nahon, Presse, Bittencourt, Sawchenko, & Vale, 1989) . Zebrafish have this gene, named originally pmch2 (renamed here pcmh), but also possess a one-exon gene that ultimately produces a peptide with \"melaninconcentrating activity\" (Berman et al., 2009; Ono, Wada, Oikawa, Kawazoe, & Kawauchi, 1988; Takayama, Wada, Kawauchi, & Ono, 1989) (Figure 1 ). The mammalian MCH, encoded by the three-exon gene, is almost identical to the 17-a.a. fish \"MCH,\" encoded by the single-exon gene (Berman et al., 2009; Kawauchi, 2006; Kawauchi et al., 1983; Nahon et al., 1989; Ono et al., 1988) . Because rat MCH was characterized after the fish peptide, both received the same name (Nahon et al., 1989) . Synteny analysis indicates, however, that the mammalian and zebrafish three-exon genes are linked evolutionarily, and higher similarity exists between the MCH peptides encoded by the three-exon genes than that by the one-exon gene (named hereafter pmchl) (Figure 2a ) (Berman et al., 2009) . A few studies have compared the expression of the pmch genes in fish adapted to different backgrounds (Berman et al., 2009; Kang & Kim, 2013; Mizusawa et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2010) , but it is unclear whether it is MCH or MCHL that mediates teleost background adaptation. Moreover, an evolutionary analysis of pmch and pmchl genes is lacking.",

We used the phylogeny of chordates to analyse the evolution of pomc, pmch and pmchl genes. We suggest an explanation for the differences in the mechanisms that evolved to regulate background adaptation by inferring ancestral relationships, and assessing associations with plastic colour change, the ability of \u03b1-MSH, MCH and MCHL peptides to be synthesized and secreted and to work as neuroendocrine hormones, as well as their effects on skin pigmentation. We propose that the evolution of background adaptation relates mainly to key changes in the pmch genes, with the topological structure of the pomc gene and the \u03b1-MSH a.a sequence both conserved during evolution. We show that the intron-less pmchl gene appears only in the Teleostei lineage, possibly as a result of an ancestral retroposition or during the teleost-specific genome duplication (TSD). Based on our analyses, we suggest renaming the intron-less gene, originally named pmch in several fish (Kawauchi, 2006; Ono et al., 1988; Takayama et al., 1989) , as pmchl, which is in concordance with the current zebrafish nomenclature convention and reflects its evolutionary origin. PMCHL gained \"hormonal status\" and is found only in teleosts, while the three-exon pmch peptide product was conserved as a brain neurotransmitter that regulates feeding behaviour. To be consistent with the evolutionary origin of both genes, in this paper we call the mammalian and fish three-exon gene, and the prehormone and the peptide generated, as pmch, PMCH and MCH, respectively, and the fish intron-less gene, pmchl, and its corresponding peptides PCMHL and MCHL. Of note, special care should be taken with the literature, as a different nomenclature was used. ",

In order to answer this question, we used two experimental models: zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the African clawed frog (X. laevis), which possess MCH/MCHL and only MCH, respectively ( Figure 2a ). Of note, studies have defined the hormonal status of an MCH in fish based on the immunohistochemical detection of MCH+ axon fibres that project to the neurohypophysis (Baker, 1993; Baker & Bird, 2002; Powell & Baker, 1988) and/or the biochemical detection of MCH peptides in blood Kishida et al., 1989) . Those studies, however, were performed before it was known that two pmch genes exist, and used polyclonal antibodies raised against either mammalian MCH (human or rat) or salmonid MCHL (Coho salmon), which likely cross-react in that MCH and MCHL a.a. sequences are almost identical ( Figure 2a ). In order to compare the background adaptation response between the two model systems, we grew three-dayold zebrafish and Xenopus larvae for 5 days with a white or a black background, and then measured skin pigmentation (Bertolesi et al., 2015) . Both species showed melanosome aggregation and a light skin colour with a white background ( Figure 2b ). Next, we asked whether the pmch+ and pmchl+ neurons in zebrafish and the pmch+ neurons of Xenopus are present in the hypothalamus, and project axons to the neurohypophysis. Of note, in zebrafish pmch and pmchl are expressed by different neurons (Berman et al., 2009) ",

To address this possibility, we assessed in species across evolution first the presence of a physiological background adaptation response, via an analysis of the literature, and, second, the structure and sequences of the pomc, pmch and pmchl genes and their corresponding peptides.",

Interestingly, several species in this group lack the dual-hormonal mechanism, in that MCH/MCHL plasma levels but not \u03b1-MSH vary with background adaptation, including flounders (Verasper moseri and Platichthys flesus) (Gilham & Baker, 1984; Kang & Kim, 2013; Mizusawa et al., 2011) and tilapias from the genus Oreochromis (Nile and Mozambique) (Gr\u00f6neveld, Balm, Martens et al., 1995a; Gr\u00f6neveld, Balm, & Wendelaar Bonga, 1995b; van der Salm, Metz, Wendelaar Bonga, & Flik, 2005) .",

Although colour skin pigmentation of several species of caecilians mimics the above-ground soil where they move (Wollenberg & Measey, 2009) , is not clear if it is a genetically mediated process (background matching) or driven by physiological colour plasticity. Therefore, caecilians were not grouped for further analysis. In contrast, background adaptation in amphibian frogs and salamanders is well documented (Table S1 ) and appears to be driven by a uni-humoral mechanism, since MCH/MCHL do not trigger melanosome aggregation (Ferroni & Castrucci, 1987; Wilkes et al., 1984) .

We focused first on the gene structure of pmch, analysing mainly organisms whose genome was fully sequenced and listed in the NCBI gene database with the exon-intron structure and gene identification number (Table S3 ). The three-exon gene appears conserved during evolution, as it is present in all groups in which we were able to find the gene, from Chondrichthyes (Group 2) to Mammals (Group 16). In contrast, the intron-less gene is present only in teleost fish (Groups 6-8; Figure 4 and Table S3 ). Teleosts possess ~30% more pigmentation-related genes than tetrapods, most of which were duplicated and retained during the TSD and are involved in specification and differentiation of pigment cells (Braasch, Brunet, Volff, & Schartl, 2010; Lorin, Brunet, Laudet, & Volff, 2018) . Thus, the idea that pmchl was retained in Teleostei by evolutionary pressure selection on a gene with a key role in pigmentation regulation (e.g., background adaptation) is tempting. (Minth, Qiu, Akil, Watson, & Dixon, 1989) and O. kisutch (MCH1) (Nahon, Presset, Schoepfer, & Vale, 1991) . We find four variants in the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which express the mRNAs (Leong et al., 2010) ( Figure 5 and Table S3 ). Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted proteins of the Group 7 salmonids and the Esociform Esox lucius shows that PMCHA and B, and PMCHLA and PMCHLB are related to PMCH and PMCHL from Esox lucius, respectively, but appeared more recently in evolution ( Figure 5 ).

In mammals, PMCH is processed to MCH and neuropeptide glutamic acid-isoleucine (NEI) (Viale et al., 1999) , a 13-a.a. peptide that affects the hypothalamic-gonadal axis (Bittencourt & Celis, 2008; Fujimoto, Fukuda, Sakamoto, Takata, & Sawamura, 2017) . Conserved sequence for the mammalian NEI is present in amphibians and reptiles (Groups 10-14), while several a.a. are absent from Group 6 species and missing completely from Group 7 and 8 species (Figure 4) . These data suggest that NEI has no biological function in teleosts. Similarly, in birds (Group 15), the predicted NEI peptide is highly modified, and the loss of the K/R R site for cleavage in chicken and Japanese quail (Figure 4) suggests that the peptide is not processed and released. Thus, NEI is conserved in land organisms, but not aquatic organisms or birds. Interestingly, a arginine-valine (NEV) neuropeptide from the rainbow trout sequence was suggested as a homologue of the mammalian NEI, based mainly on the topological position and the presence of a dibasic RR motif Nahon et al., 1989) . Our analysis shows that NEV is predicted to be processed from PMCHL but not PMCH, and in species from Groups 6 and 7, but not Group 8 (Figure 4 ). An additional putative peptide, named MCH gene-related peptide (Mgrp) (Figure 4) , is present in Nile tilapia, but does not participate in background adaptation (Gr\u00f6neveld, Balm, & Wendelaar Bonga, 1995c) .

ACTH and \u03b1-MSH arise from processing of POMC in the anterior pituitary and pars intermedia pituitary, respectively, and are utilized in distinct neuroendocrine circuits (Zhou, Bloomquist, & Mains, 1993) (Figure 6a ). \u03b2-, \u03b3-and \u03b4-MSH are also processed from POMC, but have no known role in F I G U R E 6 Topological organization of POMC and amino acid sequence alignment of ACTH/\u03b1-MSH. (a) Schematic representation of POMC with the positioning of the different processed peptides. \u03b3-MSH, \u03b2-MSH, ACTH (green) and \u03b1-MSH (red), which is at the amino-end of ACTH, are indicated and positioned based on the presence of the conserved HFRW sequence. \u03b2-Endorphin is located at the carboxy-end. The a.a. length and the position of the first a.a. of HFRW are indicated on the right and inside the ACTH/\u03b1-MSH domain, respectively. Note that \u03b4-MSH is exclusive to Group 2 (sharks) and \u03b3-MSH is not present in teleosts (Groups 6, 7 and 8), cyclostomes (Group 1) and the lineage from which arose the snakes (Group 12), but is present in lizards (half blue rectangle). Also indicated are mutations in HFRW in Groups 4 and 5 species. In lamprey, ACTH and \u03b1-MSH are encoded by different genes, named pom and poc, respectively (Heinig et al., 1995; Takahashi et al., 1995) . (b) Aligned sequences of ACTH and \u03b1-MSH (green and red box, respectively). Amino acids in \u03b1-MSH are coloured. Note similarity between Groups 2 to 16. Topological organization and sequence alignment were performed by using the following POMC prohormones (species, GenBank Acc. background adaptation (Gilham & Baker, 1984; Sumpter & Lowry, 1984) . For Group 1 cyclostomes, we analysed the peptides that would arise from two genes with homology to pomc, pom (pro-opiomelanotropin) and poc (pro-opiocortin), which contain the ACTH and the \u03b1-MSH sequences, respectively (Heinig, Keeley, Robson, Sower, & Youson, 1995; Takahashi et al., 1995) . Common to ACTH and all three MSH peptides is the presence of a His-Phe-Arg-Trp (HFRW) sequence, critical for binding and activation of MCRs (Dores et al., 2016; Schwyzer, 1977) . We used this motif to align the various POMC peptides of the different taxonomic groups (Figure 6a ).",

First, in agreement with previously described differences (Dores, Cameron, Lecaude, & Danielson, 2003; Takahashi, Amemiya, Nozaki, Sower, & Kawauchi, 2001) , the \u03b4-MSH sequence is detected only in species of Group 2 (7/7 species) (Figure 6a and Table S4 ). Second, \u03b3-MSH exists in cartilaginous fish and tetrapods, but is absent in the agnathan POC and POM (Amemiya, Takahashi, Suzuki, Sasayama, & Kawauchi, 1999) ( Figure 6a and Table S4 ). In agreement with previous studies (Dores & Baron, 2011; Kitahara et al., 1988) , we found \u03b3-MSH is also absent from Groups 6, 7 and 8. Novel is that \u03b3-MSH in Squamata is missing in the lineage giving rise to snakes (4/4 species), but is present in lineages from which lizards and geckos arose (4/4 species) ( Figure 6a and Table S4 ). Further, we find mutations in the functionally relevant HFRW motif of \u03b3-MSH in species from Groups 4 and 5 [e.g., HFHW",

Second, the homology in the region surrounding HFRW is low in agnathans (62%; 8/13 a.a. as compared to more than 92% in gnathostomes) (Figure 6b) . Finally, the affinity of \u03b1-MSH to the lamprey Mcr1 is 1,300 times lower than to the human receptor (Haitina et al., 2007; Schi\u00f6th, Petersson, Muceniece, Szardenings, & Wikberg, 1997) . The fact that \u03b1-MSH and ACTH bind to the lamprey receptor with similar affinities, while the affinity of \u03b1-MSH for the human MCR1 is 20 times higher than that of ACTH (Haitina et al., 2007; Schi\u00f6th et al., 1997) , suggests that ACTH may be the biological and the \"ancestral\" ligand for the Mcr1 in agnathans. Interestingly, the localization of \u03b1-MSH and ACTH to the intermedia and anterior pituitary, respectively, is nonetheless conserved between agnathans and gnathostomes , as is the tetrapeptide HFRW required to bind Mcr1 (Figure 6b ) (Costa et al., 2004; Schwyzer, 1977) .",

In birds, \u03b1-MSH is likely produced in a paracrine manner in the integument, and not from the pars intermedia pituitary, which birds lack (Boswell & Takeuchi, 2005) . In mammals, \u03b1-MSH levels change seasonally, rising during spring/summer and decreasing in autumn/winter (Altmeyer, St\u00f6hr, & Holzmann, 1986; Lincoln & Baker, 1995; McFarlane et al., 2011) , but the mechanisms and the source of \u03b1-MSH are unknown. A possible explanation for the differences with Groups 10-14 is that species therein require rapid colour plasticity for thermoregulation (Fan, Stuart-Fox, & Cadena, 2014; Tattersall, Eterovick, & Andrade, 2006) , a need minimized in birds and mammals with an \"insulated\" integument.",

Whether MCHL is responsible is unclear, in that we were unable to find pcmhl in any holostean genome, including that of the fully sequenced Lepisosteus oculatus (Figure 7 ). Thus, it is possible that the dualhormonal system was present in the common ancestor of holosteans and teleosts.

We suggest pcmhl appears early in the teleost lineage by retroposition or during the TSD, with MCHL-expressing neurons then selected over evolution to extend F I G U R E 7 Genetics and the hormonal status of MCHL explain the different mechanisms for background adaptation. Groups able to background-adapt are indicated with a white/black circle. The genetic basis corresponds to the presence of a highly conserved 13-a.a. \u03b1-MSH (red square), a three-exon pmch gene (three yellow bars) or a one-exon pmchl gene (yellow square), while hormonal status indicates the capacity of an MCH to be released into the bloodstream. A teleost-specific pmchl gene encodes MCHL, which acts as a hormone in background adaptation, while the conserved pmch gene encodes MCH, which we suggest acts as a neurotransmitter to regulate energy homoeostasis and food intake. The six different mechanisms for background adaptation include the following: (a) Group 1: no significant role for \u03b1-MSH and MCH; (b) Groups 2 to 4: \u03b1-MSH but not MCH participates; (c) Group 5: hormonal status appears with a dual role of \u03b1-MSH and MCH in regulating skin pigmentation; (d) Groups 6-8: a \"dual control theory\" mechanism for background adaptation at the bottom of Teleostei lineage (Groups 6 and 7) and a single main regulator, likely MCHL, at the top (Group 8); (e) Group 9: \u03b1-MSH but not MCH regulates background adaptation; (f) Groups 10-14: a uni-humoral \u03b1-MSH system that also is involved in thermoregulation; and (g) Groups 15 and 16: \u03b1-MSH and MCH roles changed in homoeotherms as insulation systems (fur and feathers) appear during the evolution of endothermy their axons to the pituitary. In this manner, function was split between neurotransmitter (MCH) and hormonal (MCHL) roles. In support of the dual control theory in Groups 6 and 7, physiological changes in both \u03b1-MSH (black background) and MCHL (white background) are produced when background is altered. For example, in the eel (Group 7), MCH induces melanosome aggregation, and a salmon MCHL antibody labels secretory granules in neurons with fibres that terminate on neurohypophysial blood vessels, whose density varies between white and black adapted organisms (Gilham & Baker, 1984; Powell & Baker, 1988) . Plasma \u03b1-MSH levels increase in eels with a black background . In zebrafish, in addition to the hormonal status for MCHL suggested by our expression analysis (Figure 2) , a white background increases pmchl mRNA levels, while fasting increases the expression of pmch (Berman et al., 2009) . A black background in zebrafish triggers melanosome dispersion via \u03b1-MSH interaction with Mcr1 expressed by melanophores (Richardson et al., 2008) . In two Group 8 species, Starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus (Kang & Kim, 2013) ) and Barfin flounder (Verasper moseri (Mizusawa et al., 2015) ), pmch and pmchl mRNAs increase in white backgroundadapted organisms, although most robustly for pmchl. Because MCHL, but not pomc mRNA/\u03b1-MSH, levels change with background in several Group 8 species at the top of the Teleostei lineage, it is possible that during evolution the balance between \u03b1-MSH and MCH changed from \u03b1-MSH\u00bbMCH in Groups 2-4, to a dual mechanism in Groups 6 and 7 (\u03b1-MSH = MCH2), to \u03b1-MSH\u00abMCHL in Group 8 species (Figure 7) .",

Castrucci, 1993) , suggesting that MCH does not have hormonal status and plays no role in skin pigmentation ( Figure 7 ). 6. Groups 10-14: A uni-humoral \u03b1-MSH control system for background adaptation and thermoregulation. MCHL is not present in amphibians and reptiles, and MCH appears to lack hormonal status ( Figure 7) . Indeed, while the hypothalamus contains MCH-expressing cells in frogs (Rana esculenta; Group 10), Squamata (Podarcis muralis and Natrix natrix; Group 12) and turtles (Trachemys scripta; Group 13), their axons do not project to the posterior pituitary (Cardot et al., 1994; L\u00e1z\u00e1r et al., 2002) . Thus, \u03b1-MSH is the main regulator of background adaptation and may also be important for temperature regulation of ectotherms though colour plasticity (Fernandez & Bagnara, 1991) .",

In birds and mammals, MCHL does not exist, MCH+ cells do not extend axons to the pituitary (Cardot et al., 1999; Cort\u00e9s et al., 2014) , and the pars intermedia pituitary disappears in birds, arguing against a hormonal status for MCH (Figure 7) . Birds rely on carotenoid ingestion for background adaptation, while in mammals \u03b1-MSH possibly associates with seasonal colour moulting. Thus, while colour plasticity is important for thermoregulation in ectotherms, in feather/hair covered homoeotherms, skin pigment cells changed with regard to cell type (only melanocytes in birds and mammals), pigment type (eumelanin and pheomelanin) and properties (pigment secretion vs. dispersion/aggregation).",

The antibody labelled both pmch+ and pmchl+ cells in zebrafish, indicating it recognized both peptides. A clear difference was observed when we tracked the MCH/ MCHL-positive axon projections from the pmch+ or pmchl+ cells. The pmchl+ cells localized close to the pituitary and projected their axons to the neurohypophysis, while in both Xenopus and zebrafish, MCHexpressing axons of pmch+ cells projected mainly dorsalwards within the brain (Figure 2c), suggesting a hormonal status for MCHL but not MCH in zebrafish. Together, these results suggest that in fish MCHL possesses hormonal status to regulate background adaptation, while MCH in fish and frogs likely acts as it does in mammals, as a neurotransmitter that participates in physiological responses associated with homoeostasis and feeding behaviours (Figure 2c).",

With the development of feathers and fur in birds and mammals, respectively (thermal insulation systems), melanocytes became secretory, contributing melanin to surrounding keratinocytes to determine feather/hair pigmentation(Lin et al., 2013;Parichy & Spiewak, 2015). Common climate factors may have contributed to evolution of endothermy in both lineages, since the oldest preserved fossils with fur(Ji, Luo, Yuan, & Tabrum, 2006) and feathers(Prum & Brush, 2002) with insulation capacity come from a similar evolutionary time, but arose independently in the Avian-Sauropsida (birds) and Synapsida (mammals) lineages(Lovegrove, 2017) (Figure 3; blue circle; feathers and fur). Background adaptation in both lineages involves neuroendocrine regulation of coloration through melanocyte deposition of eumelanin (grey/black) or pheomelanin (orange/red) into feathers and fur, though colour in birds comes also from the dietary contribution of pigment carotenoids(Roulin & Ducrest, 2013).In summary, our analysis indicates that living gnathostomes, from Chondrichthyans (Group 2) to all Osteichthyans (Groups 3-16), are able to adapt their skin colour to different backgrounds(Figure 3black/ white circle), while agnathans (living cyclostomes) do not. Thus, background adaptation in vertebrates seems to have appeared early during the radiation of gnathostomes. Interestingly, the role of \u03b1-MSH and MCH/MCHL peptides changed during evolution, with species adapting to background through either a uni-or dual-humoral mechanism.",

            "text": "Based on these analyses, and lack of demonstrated function in pigmentation, we argue for the renaming of the original pmch2 gene(Berman et al., 2009) as pmch, in recognition of its conservation across species. Because the intron-less gene is present in fish, but is not conserved during evolution, we suggest naming this gene pmchl in accordance with Zebrafish Nomenclature Convention. Two pmch and two pmchl genes exist in species of the taxonomic order Salmoniform, but only one in non-salmonid species of Group 7 (i.e., Esociform Esox lucius) or Group 6 (D. rerio)(Figures 4 and 5 andTable S3). Variants of pcmh and pcmhl originated presumably as a result of the salmonid-specific fourth vertebrate whole-genome duplication (SS4R), which occurred 80 mya in the common ancestor of the salmonid lineage(Lien et al., 2016) (Figure 3, yellow rectangle in Group 7). We suggest the genes should be named pmcha and pmchb, and pmchla and pmchlb, respectively. pmchla and pmchlb are present in O. keta (named MCH1 and MCH2)(Ono et al., 1988), O. mykiss (MCH1 and MCH2)(Baker, Levy, Hall, & Lightman, 1995), O. tshawytscha (MCH1 and MCH2)",

The TSD occurred ~320 mya, following the split of Teleostei from the other three taxonomic classes (Cladistei, Chondrostei and Holostei), but prior to the divergence of the other major Teleostei groups (Figure 3; TSD) (Hoegg, Brinkmann, Taylor, & Meyer, 2004).Thus, the three-exon pmch gene was probably the original gene and conserved throughout evolution, while pmchl appeared in the teleost lineage. Both pmch and pmchl duplicated more recently in salmonids (SS4R). Of note, mammalian genomes contain a single MCH gene with three exons (NM_002674.3; gene number 5367), and two MCH-like genes, PMCHL1 (NR_003921.1; gene number 5369) and PMCHL2 (NR_003922.1; gene number 5370), but the latter two genes arose during primate evolution and are chimeric (non-coding) four-exon pseudogenes of unknown function",

X. laevis embryos were obtained from Chorionic Gonadotrophin (Intervet Canada Ltd., Kirkland, QC, Canada) induced egg production and in vitro fertilization according to standard procedures. Tupfel Longfin (TL) zebrafish (ZIRC, Eugene, OR) embryos were raised at 28.5\u00b0C in E3 medium supplemented with 0.25 mg/L methylene blue. Three-day-old larval zebrafish and X. laevis larvae were maintained for five additional days at 22\u00b0C on a white or black background. The chamber (40 cm length \u00d7 20 cm width \u00d7 25 cm height) contained an overhead T5 bulb (F875 cool white light fluorescent; light output, 470 lumens; colour temperature, 4,000;colour rendering index, 60), with a luminescence at the embryo dish surface of 1,000 lux, approximately 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 W/cm 2 . Light was set to cycle with an automatic clock to 14 hr ON/10 hr OFF.",
