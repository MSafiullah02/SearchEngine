However, studies conducted during the last several decades have struggled to define precise quantitative models for the incidence of these diseases. Most large studies were conducted in hospitals and thus lacked a known denominator of subjects at risk. These studies also varied by differences in geographic location of the study, type of hospital, age of the patients, season, criteria for admission, severity of disease, and number and type of diagnostic tests performed. The relatively new use of molecular diagnostic tests has increased our ability to diagnose virus infection, but comparison of data from these studies with data from cell culture\u2013based studies is problematic.",

Viral culture and polymerase chain reaction identification of viruses from nasal and throat samples were obtained from all surveillance children, providing population-based rates of hospitalization for RSV, influenza virus, and PIV, as well as demographic, clinical, and risk factor assessment for each virus. Of the 592 enrolled children, RSV was identified in 20%, influenza in 3%, PIV in 7%, other respiratory viruses in 36%, and no detectable virus in 39%. Population-based rates of acute respiratory illness hospitalizations in children younger than 5 years of age were 18 per 1000. Virus-positive hospitalization rates per 1000 children were 3.5 for RSV, 1.2 for PIV, and 0.6 for influenza virus. Younger age (particularly younger than 1 year of age), African-American and Hispanic race/ethnicity, male gender, and presence of chronic underlying illness were associated with higher hospitalization rates.",

Viruses are infrequently the cause of this presentation, and pneumonia often is only part of a more generalized presentation of a systemic disease. Rubella and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection associated with systemic disease in the mother can be associated with severe congenital or neonatal disease that probably is acquired by the transplacental route, presumably through the hematogenous spread of virus. Pneumonia manifests with signs of respiratory distress (e.g., retractions, grunting, tachypnea, and cyanosis) that sometimes requires immediate resuscitation and mechanical ventilation because of depressed respiration. Neonatal viral pneumonia can present with more nonspecific systemic signs of illness, such as apnea, bradycardia, poor peripheral perfusion, or temperature instability. These signs also are found frequently in bacterial pneumonia in the neonatal period. Usually, infants with congenital CMV or rubella pneumonia exhibit additional signs of congenital infection, such as petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, and low birth weight. CMV infection is detected by testing the infant's urine in shell vial or conventional cell culture.",

HSV is capable of infecting the infant via an ascending route from the vagina; the risk of transmission from an infected mother is increased after prolonged rupture of the membranes during labor. The infection may be acquired without prolonged rupture of the membranes during the passage through the birth canal. Transmission is more efficient if the mother is suffering a primary infection, as opposed to a re-activation. The presence of visible herpetic lesions is not needed for transmission to the infant. Herpes simplex virus infection commonly presents in the second week of life. The medical history from the families of infants with pneumonia at this age should consider risk factors, and the physical examination should seek other manifestations of herpetic infection. The cytopathic effects of HSV have been observed in the lungs of infants with pneumonia caused by herpes infection. Systemic HSV infection should be treated with a prolonged course of intravenous acyclovir. Enteroviruses commonly cause symptomatic or asymptomatic infections of the gastrointestinal tract during the summer and fall months. Infected mothers can transmit an enterovirus infection to the infant during birth, and these infections can cause severe systemic disease including pneumonia. When viral infection is acquired from contaminated amniotic fluid or in the birth canal, the infant may not be affected clinically in the first hours or days after birth.",

            "text": "A large panel of respiratory viruses is capable of causing pneumonia during childhood. RSV; human metapneumovirus (hMPV); PIV types 1, 2, and 3; influenza virus types A and B; and adenoviruses make up the majority of cases. RSV is still the most frequent cause of severe respiratory infections in infants after the first weeks of life and in young children, and it is responsible for 75,000 to 125,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States.4\n,\n5 The role of rhinoviruses in causing LRTI such as pneumonia is under much discussion. Rhinovirus infection in children is so common that evidence for rhinovirus infection can be found frequently in children without symptoms of disease. Therefore, attributing causality to rhinovirus in cases of pneumonia is more difficult than with other viruses. Nevertheless, rhinovirus is present significantly more often in cases of childhood pneumonia, and some experts believe that rhinovirus is the most common etiology of all types of LRTI in children. Human rhinoviruses, members of the family Picornaviridae, were first isolated in the 1950s, and now there have been over 100 serotypes identified based on nucleotide sequence homologies. Human rhinoviruses were divided into two major genetic groups in the past: designated HRV-A and HRV-B. More recently, a new rhinovirus group, HRV-C, has been found in some patients with LRTI. PIVs, commonly associated with laryngotracheitis (croup syndrome), also cause pneumonia but in less discrete epidemics than those caused by RSV. PIV infections are common in the fall months but can occur at any time of the year. Influenza A and B viruses cause sharp winter epidemics. In the developing world, measles virus is still a major cause of pneumonia, especially in the setting of malnutrition or vitamin A deficiency, and mumps virus can cause LRTI. Influenza virus type C and PIV type 4 cause upper respiratory tract disease, but their ability to cause lower respiratory tract disease is less clear. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by SARS-coronavirus, which was first recognized in Hong Kong during a 2003 epidemic, and this disease affected children.6 Morbidity was high following SARS, with approximately one fourth of patients requiring intensive care and/or mechanical ventilation support. SARS morbidity and mortality are milder in children than they are in adults, and pneumonia was only one of the disease manifestations of what appears to be a systemic illness. Other more conventional human coronaviruses also cause some cases of pneumonia (e.g., the long-recognized OC43 and 229E strains or the more recently identified coronavirus NL63 and HKU1 strains).7 Varicella-zoster virus can cause pneumonia during primary infection, especially in older subjects. Other viruses cause pneumonia less commonly (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus, CMV, and human herpesvirus).6 The immunocompromised are a special population at elevated risk for these infections, especially for CMV. Human bocavirus is a parvovirus that has been found in many respiratory secretions, but often in the same frequency in cases as in controls. Therefore, it is not clear that this agent is a significant cause of human disease.",

Children's Hospital studies,8, 9, 10, 11 Chapel Hill Pediatrics surveillance study,12 the Vanderbilt Vaccine clinic surveillance studies,13\n,\n14 the Tecumseh study of respiratory illness (Tecumseh, Michigan), and the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study. The principal viruses identified in association with pneumonia in otherwise healthy infants and children were RSV, PIV, and influenza viruses. These studies used cell culture\u2013based or serologic detection for the most part, and it is fair to say that most of these studies did not have optimal culture systems for rhinoviruses or coronaviruses. More recently, very large studies using database methods, such as the U.S. National Hospital Discharge Survey data system15\n,\n16 or the Tennessee Medicaid Database17 (approximately 1% of U.S. children) have confirmed the earlier findings with larger numbers and added detail about the risk factors for severe disease. In the last several years, new data have emerged on the role of a newly identified paramyxovirus, hMPV,18 which was shown to be one of the most common causes associated with LRTI in children.19 Before 2001, studies could not address the epidemiology of this virus because it had not been discovered.",

Alveolar walls thicken, and the alveolar space becomes occluded with exudates, sloughed cells, and activated macrophages. The clinical disease is distinguished by poor air exchange, first noted by poor oxygenation (detected by pulse oximetry or blood gas measurement) followed by CO2 retention. The physiology of the disease reflects an inflammatory process that interferes with gas exchange, resulting in elevation of the alveolar-arterial Po\n2 difference. Many cases of viral pneumonia in young children are also accompanied by inflammation of the bronchioles, and air trapping contributes to the poor level of gas exchange. Children compensate for respiratory compromise better than do adults, generally by increasing the respiratory rate. Children show a remarkable resilience when faced with respiratory compromise, even though their airways exhibit a much higher intrinsic level of resistance. Unrelieved tachypnea, however, can lead to exhaustion and respiratory failure. The histopathologic mechanisms underlying acute viral pulmonary disease in otherwise healthy children are not completely understood because lung tissue is rarely obtained for histology before mechanical ventilation or other medical interventions in previously healthy patients.",

It is thought that the initial infection occurs in the nasopharynx after inoculation with contaminated respiratory secretions (fomite transmission) or exposure to large-particle aerosols containing virus. The viruses that cause pneumonia all have surface fusion proteins that mediate both virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion in monolayer cell culture. The viruses cause cytopathic effects following infection by inducing necrosis or apoptosis of infected cells. The viral fusion peptides of these viruses cause multinucleated cell (syncytium) formation in cell monolayer cultures. It is presumed that they cause syncytia formation in vivo, but the direct evidence for this is scarce. In fact, viruses that cause syncytium in nonpolarized cultured cells (i.e., cells that do not form tight junctions and segregate apical and basolateral cell membrane regions) often do not cause syncytia in polarized cell lines or primary cells in culture. Most of these viruses appear to infect both ciliated and nonciliated cells in culture. Impaired mucociliary clearance caused by infection of ciliated cells probably contributes to progression to pneumonia. Whether these viruses infect type I or II pneumocytes more efficiently is not known. Some of the respiratory viruses cause an abortive round of infection in cultured macrophages or dendritic cells. Infection of these antigen-presenting cell types may contribute to inflammatory disease of the lung.",

Autopsy of fatal RSV cases has demonstrated the presence of relatively little virus antigen, and pathologic changes in fatal cases can be patchy in distribution. Bronchoalveolar lavage and tissue specimens from hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients or autopsies evaluated by direct immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase stains revealed epithelial cells and macrophages that stain positive for RSV proteins, and electron microscopy revealed occasional epithelial cells with cytoplasmic inclusions composed of filamentous virions.

Radiologic findings on chest radiographs of viral pneumonia are similar to those of bronchiolitis and reactive airways disease. The usual findings on chest radiographs are hyperaeration, prominent lung markings caused by bronchial wall thickening, and focal areas of atelectasis (Fig. 28-1\n). The hili may be somewhat prominent, but major hilar adenopathy is uncommon. The findings are commonly thought to differ from the typical case of bacterial pneumonia, which usually has been thought to present as lobar consolidation. It is true that most children with focal alveolar pneumonia have laboratory evidence of a bacterial infection, especially those with lobar infiltrates. However, half of the children with solely interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph had evidence of bacterial infection in some studies.23 Therefore, radiologic presentation of interstitial infiltrates alone does not distinguish between bacterial and viral pneumonia. One also cannot differentiate viral pneumonia from bronchiolitis or reactive airways disease on the basis of radiologic findings alone. Differentiation is based on non-radiologic factors such as the age of the patient and the clinical history. The chest radiograph in newborns with viral pneumonia usually shows bilateral diffuse densities or may have a granular appearance, similar to that found in hyaline membrane disease. When infection is congenital, radiographic changes may be present at birth, whereas the radiographs of infants infected during birth may be normal initially but can progress rapidly during the first days of life.",

Culture of virus in cell monolayer cultures is considered the gold standard. Viruses are identified by characteristic cytopathic effect and are confirmed by immunodetection using virus-specific antibodies and fluorescence detection. Culture techniques require a high level of expertise and generally are best performed on fresh specimens (e.g., secretions obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration or nasopharyngeal swab). Rapid diagnostic tests for RSV and influenzas A and B based on the immunodetection of viral proteins in nasopharyngeal secretions are widely used, but their positive predictive value is more appropriate for use during epidemics, when the prevalence of positive tests is expected to be high. Antigen detection tests are not sensitive enough to determine that a hospitalized patient is no longer shedding infectious virus; therefore, negative tests should not be used to justify termination of contact precautions in a patient with viral pneumonia. Increasingly, clinical detection of viruses is being performed by molecular genetic techniques, such as reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization or sequence analysis. This technique identifies the presence of viral nucleic acid. Polymerase chain reaction tests tend to be more sensitive than cell culture during the period of viral clearance (1 to 3 weeks after infection). It is not clear how long viral RNAs are present following active infections, but evidence to date shows that they may persist for weeks or months, even when virus can no longer be cultured. Therefore, a positive polymerase chain reaction\u2013based test must be used with caution because in some cases a positive test obtained during an acute pneumonia is actually related to a recent infection. Serology is helpful to diagnose or confirm infection, particularly in the clinical research setting. A four-fold increase in serum antibodies against a virus between the pre-infection period and after infection suggests a specific diagnosis, particularly when testing the binding to targets of functional antibodies. In practice, the use of serologic tests to diagnose the cause of pneumonia is difficult because the increase in antibodies in young children may not achieve a significant level until 6 to 8 weeks or more have passed.",

Oxygen is required if there is grunting, flaring, severe tachypnea, and retractions, or if pulse oximetry indicates oxygen saturation below 90% to 92%, or arterial blood gas measurement indicates depressed Po\n2 (< 60 to 70 mm Hg). Retention of CO2 is particularly concerning, especially in the face of tachypnea. Severe respiratory distress, hypoxia, and dehydration are among the indications for hospitalization. Care in the hospital is principally supportive, such as the delivery of supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids, and the use of mechanical ventilation in the case of respiratory failure. The youngest infants with RSV pneumonia may require monitoring for the risk of apnea, although apnea usually presents near the beginning of the illness. Chest physiotherapy and mucolytics have unproven efficacy in viral pneumonia. If a specific viral diagnosis is made early in the course of illness, there are some antiviral medications available. Licensed drugs for influenza infection include the M2 ion-channel inhibitors amantidine and rimantidine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. Many influenza viruses are resistant to the ion channel inhibitors, however. These antiviral compounds work best when therapy is initiated in the first days of infection and are particularly relevant for those with immunosuppression or preexisting cardiopulmonary disease. Ribavirin delivered as an aerosol is licensed for treatment of severe RSV infection, but recent studies have questioned its value. Most centers do not routinely treat otherwise healthy infants with RSV pneumonia with ribavirin. RSV intravenous immune globulin and palivizumab (an intramuscular injectable humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the RSV fusion protein) are available for prophylaxis against RSV disease and are indicated for children with chronic cardiopulmonary disease and other serious risk factors. Clinical trials of therapy of acute disease using these antibody preparations, however, have not shown this treatment to be effective during hospitalization. Antibiotic therapy does not improve the outcome in viral pneumonia and has not been shown to alter the risk of bacterial complication of viral pneumonia as a superinfection. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the setting of viral infection causes the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. If secondary infection does occur, usually in hospitalized patients in intensive care units, the selected infecting bacterium may not be susceptible to conventional antibiotics. Therefore, specific diagnosis of the etiology of severe pneumonia suspected to be of viral etiology is warranted to minimize inappropriate antibiotic exposure, even when an antiviral therapeutic option is not anticipated.",

            "text": "Many of the common sequelae of bacterial pneumonia (e.g., persistent effusions, empyemas, abscess formation, and pneumatoceles) are distinctly uncommon following viral pneumonia. Therefore, the prognosis for most forms of viral pneumonia caused by conventional respiratory viruses is excellent. Most otherwise healthy children with uncomplicated pneumonia recover without sequelae. Complications during influenza pneumonia in children range from acute otitis media, sinusitis, and bacterial tracheitis to rare episodes of encephalitis, myositis, myocarditis, febrile seizures, encephalopathy, or Reyes syndrome. RSV disease is commonly complicated by otitis media. Immunocompromised children, those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and neonates are at the highest risk for severe sequelae. Pulmonary hypertension can complicate the course of neonatal pneumonia, and concomitant pulmonary hemorrhage due to vascular damage may follow. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema and other types of gas leaks can occur, especially during mechanical ventilation. Mortality is high in neonatal viral pneumonia, especially in premature infants in whom the disease may resemble severe hyaline membrane disease. Infants with severe viral pneumonia early in life who require mechanical ventilation or treatment with high concentrations of supplemental oxygen are at increased risk of chronic lung disease. Some cases of viral pneumonia, especially those due to rapid-onset severe adenovirus infection, can lead to bronchiolitis obliterans and hyperlucent lung syndrome. The prognosis for pneumonia due to more uncommon causes of viral pneumonia (e.g., varicella-zoster virus, SARS-coronavirus, and measles virus) can be guarded.",

Secretory IgA is uniquely suited for antiviral activity at the respiratory mucosal surface. Mucosal antibody secretion occurs locally, and polymeric IgA is taken up specifically by the polyimmunoglobulin receptor at the base of polarized epithelial cells, transcytosed in the apical direction, and secreted onto the mucosa. Antibodies may contribute to the resolution of acute primary infection of the lung. IgA and IgG RSV antibodies are present in the nasal secretions of infants early in infection, and the decrease in virus shedding in infants infected with RSV has been associated temporally with the detection of RSV-specific IgA in nasal washes. Laboratory studies and clinical trials provide strong evidence for the dominant role of antibodies in protection against re-infection. Maternal antibodies do not cross the placenta efficiently before 32 weeks gestation; therefore, premature infants are lacking the serum antibody protection against viral pneumonia that is conferred to term infants.",

            "text": "Cell-mediated immunity probably plays a primary role in the clearance of established respiratory virus pneumonia in humans. The best evidence to support this concept is that patients with defects in cellular immunity (e.g., recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or patients with cancer undergoing immunosuppressive chemotherapy) suffer more prolonged virus shedding or more frequent and more severe illnesses with RSV, MPV, influenza virus, or PIV type 3. The role in humans of cell-mediated immune effectors in protection against disease on re-infection or during virus challenge following immunization is less clear, however. Macrophages are abundant in the alveolar spaces of the lung. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that the resident pulmonary alveolar macrophage population actively suppresses the antigen-presenting function of lung dendritic cells (DCs) in situ. Low numbers of DCs and high numbers of macrophages have been noted in the human alveolar compartment, suggesting that the alveolar compartment may be less efficient for mounting an immune response. Human alveolar macrophages recovered during RSV infection can yield small amounts of RSV, but replication of RSV in alveolar macrophages is restricted. Inoculation of human alveolar macrophages with live or inactivated RSV induces increased secretion of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10.",

Recruitment of a wave of DCs into the respiratory tract mucosa appears to be a feature of the acute cellular response to local challenge with viral protein antigens or virus infection. Differentiation of DCs in the lung, homing of particular types of DCs to the lung, and crosstalk between adaptive immune cells and DCs in the lung are all areas of current research.",

            "text": "The viruses that commonly cause viral pneumonia are ubiquitous, and every child becomes infected in the first years of life with most of the common respiratory viruses. It is not feasible to avoid or prevent exposure or infection completely; therefore, the practical goal is to avoid infection at a time of high risk and to prevent severe disease or complications during infection. Thorough hand hygiene, the use of contact isolation, and patient or provider cohorting are critical to the prevention of the nosocomial spread of infection to high-risk individuals in the hospital. Vaccination of at-risk individuals with licensed vaccines for seasonal influenza virus is wise. Influenza antivirals can be used effectively as a prophylactic treatment in some for the prevention of symptomatic influenza disease during an epidemic or immediately following exposure. Prophylactic treatments with an RSV monoclonal antibody (palivizumab, IM) can be used in infants at high risk of RSV disease, and these treatments prevent half or more of RSV hospitalizations during treatment. The combination of risk factors that best predicts susceptibility to hospitalization due to RSV is not entirely clear, but includes extreme prematurity, bronchopulmonary disease, and oxygen dependence. More subtle influences are important, but they affect risk incrementally. The use of the live attenuated measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is effective against measles and mumps disease, and varicella vaccine prevents severe disease caused by that virus. An adenovirus vaccine has been used effectively, but only in the military to prevent epidemic disease in adults who live in close quarters.",
