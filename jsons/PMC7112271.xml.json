The first two CoVs have been known since the 1960s, while the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002 led to an active search for novel CoVs and the identification of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 in 2004 and 2005, respectively (van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005a). The common human CoVs are generally associated with relatively mild clinical symptoms and cause a self-limiting upper respiratory tract disease (common cold) (Walsh et al., 2013). In some cases, common CoVs may also be associated with more severe pathogenesis in the lower respiratory tract, such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia (Pene et al., 2003, van der Hoek et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2005b). Human CoVs cause more serious disease in young, elderly, or immunocompromised individuals, and they may lead to exacerbation of preexisting conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, frequently requiring hospitalization (Mayer et al., 2016, Varkey and Varkey, 2008). Considering that the prevalence of these viruses ranges between 3% and 16% and that around 70% of the population is infected during childhood, with recurrent infections occurring throughout life (van der Hoek, 2007, Zhou et al., 2013b), common human CoVs represent a significant burden to public health.",

The first, SARS-CoV, emerged in Southern China and spread around the globe in late 2002 and early 2003, infecting at least 8000 people and killing nearly 10% of the infected individuals (Lee et al., 2003). The second, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), was first reported in 2012 in the Middle East and there are still ongoing reports of sporadic cases, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This virus has caused close to 1782 laboratory-confirmed cases, resulting in 634 deaths, and is the cause of an important outbreak in Korea that started in May 2015, leading to more than 186 confirmed cases with a death toll of 36, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/).",

In this chapter, we will mainly focus on the development of vaccines suitable to prevent infections caused by highly pathogenic CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in humans. To date, a wide range of vaccine candidates have been developed for these viruses, including subunit, whole-inactivated virus, DNA, and vectored vaccines (see reviews by Du and Jiang, 2015, Enjuanes et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2014a). However, in many cases, these vaccines were found to induce antibody-dependent enhancement of infectivity (ADEI) and eosinophilia. In contrast, live-attenuated vaccines have a long history of success and are the most frequently used vaccines in humans. This chapter will be focusing on a recently developed next generation of live-attenuated vaccines based on recombinant viruses. Attenuation of viruses generally relies on the previous identification of genes involved in viral virulence in specific hosts. Often, these genes encode proteins that antagonize the innate immune response, and their deletion leads to recombinant viruses that are attenuated in their virulence and, therefore, may be developed into candidate vaccines. The timeline from bench research to approved vaccine use is generally 10 years or more (Papaneri et al., 2015). The use of genetically engineered viruses may significantly reduce both the time and costs required for vaccine development and production. In this chapter, specific features of promising vaccine candidates in meeting the earlier criteria will be reviewed.",

It is similar to cellular mRNAs, as it contains 5\u2032-capped and 3\u2032 polyadenylated ends. The 5\u2032-terminal two-thirds of the genome contain two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a and ORF1b (Fig. 1). Translation of ORF1a yields polyprotein 1a (pp1a), and -1 ribosomal frameshifting allows translation of ORF1b to yield pp1ab (Ziebuhr, 2005). Together, these polyproteins are co- and posttranslationally processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), most of them being involved in viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA synthesis. The 3\u2032-third of the genome encodes a series of structural proteins in the order 5\u2032-S-E-M-N-3\u2032 and genus-specific proteins that vary in number among the different CoV members (Fig. 1) (de Groot et al., 2012, Sola et al., 2015).",

Fully human neutralizing antibodies may be developed using different technologies and applied as therapeutic or prophylactic agents (Jiang et al., 2014, Tang et al., 2014, ter Meulen et al., 2004, Ying et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2005, Zhu et al., 2007). Of special interest are the potent human cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies specific for SARS-CoV (Pascal et al., 2015). Since most of these antibodies target the receptor-binding domain of the spike (S) glycoprotein, antigenic variability within the S gene among human and animal strains must be considered in the design of broad-spectrum neutralizing molecules (Ying et al., 2015b). A combination of mAbs targeting different epitopes may be used to prevent the emergence of escape mutants and, potentially, generate a synergistic neutralizing effect (Ying et al., 2015a). In line with this, passive immunotherapy with mouse or dromedary immune serum was shown to be protective in animal models against SARS-CoV (Subbarao et al., 2004) and MERS-CoV (Zhao et al., 2015b), respectively, suggesting that this approach may be used prophylactically or therapeutically in infected patients.",

Moreover, an inverse correlation was observed between IgA secretion and MERS-CoV infectivity in patients, suggesting that virus-specific IgA production may be a suitable tool to evaluate the potency of candidate vaccines against MERS-CoV (Muth et al., 2015). However, the IgA response is short lived in patients. In contrast, virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells persisted for up to 6 years after SARS-CoV infection, at which time memory B cells and virus-specific antibodies were undetectable (Yang et al., 2006). It has been shown that memory CD8+ T cells specific for an immunodominant epitope substantially protected aged mice from lethal SARS-CoV infection (Channappanavar et al., 2014). After challenge, memory CD8+ T cells produced effector cytokines (interferon gamma, IFN-\u03b3; tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF-\u03b1; and interleukin 2, IL-2) and cytolytic molecules, reducing viral loads in the lung. However, dysregulation of some of these inflammatory mediators, including type I IFN and inflammatory monocyte\u2013macrophage responses, caused lethal pneumonia in SARS-CoV-infected mice and, therefore, should be considered during vaccine design to minimize immunopathology (Channappanavar et al., 2016). In addition to the protective effect mediated by memory CD8+ T cells, SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T cell and antibody responses are likely necessary for complete protection. The requirement of T-cell responses in MERS-CoV protection was also suggested by immunization experiments in macaques (Muthumani et al., 2015). Therefore, for effective protection, CoV vaccines should elicit not only antibody responses but also specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.",

A recent serological study using infectious MERS-CoV isolates collected from patients in Saudi Arabia in 2014 showed no significant differences in serum neutralization, indicating that all these isolates belong to the same serotype (Muth et al., 2015).

For example, SARS-CoV-specific domain in the S protein was found to contain an epitope (80R) that critically determines the sensitivity of a given virus to neutralizing antibodies specific for this epitope. Variants of this epitope have been found in SARS-like-CoVs from civet cats and in human SARS-CoVs that evolved during the epidemics. While the majority of SARS-CoVs from the first outbreak were sensitive to the 80R-specific antibody, the GD03 strain isolated from the index patient of the second outbreak was resistant, confirming the importance of the S protein's natural antigenic variability in eliciting neutralizing antibody responses (Sui et al., 2005).",

However, although neutralizing mAbs directed against epitopes located at the interface between the viral S protein and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), proved to have great potency and breadth in neutralizing multiple viral strains (Sui et al., 2014), both the single and combined use of one or two mAbs, respectively, failed to prevent the emergence of antibody escape variants. Therefore, the use of one or two neutralizing mAbs that target a structurally flexible SARS-CoV epitope may be of limited value for in vivo immunotherapies and should be combined with neutralizing mAbs that bind a second conserved epitope with low structural plasticity.",

Additional models for MERS-CoV based on dromedary camels and other animal species have also been reported (Falzarano et al., 2014, Haagmans et al., 2016, van Doremalen and Munster, 2015). Their large size and the lack of clear clinical signs of disease make camels a less suitable model for studying MERS-CoV pathology. Marmosets show clinical signs following infection with MERS-CoV virus but, in this case, research animals and appropriate reagents suitable to characterize the immune response are scarce or not available, limiting the use of this model system (van Doremalen and Munster, 2015). Hamsters cannot be naturally infected by MERS-CoV, largely preventing their use as an animal model. MERS-CoV S protein-mediated binding to its receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), involves interactions with 14 amino acid residues. Appropriate replacements of five residues that differ between hamster and human DPP4 render the hamster DPP4 a functional receptor for MERS-CoV (van Doremalen et al., 2014). Thus far, Tg hamsters have not been used due to the lack of specific gene targeting tools. With the availability of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the situation may now change and hamsters susceptible to MERS-CoV might be developed but their suitability as animal models of MERS-CoV-induced disease remains unclear at present.",

A key difference between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is that SARS-CoV infects several strains of mice, whereas MERS-CoV does not (Coleman et al., 2014b, Gretebeck and Subbarao, 2015). A standard procedure was the adaptation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to grow in mice and reproduce the disease caused in humans. This strategy was directly applied in the case of SARS-CoV using conventional mouse strains without the need for Tg mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (Day et al., 2009, Frieman et al., 2012, Roberts et al., 2007). Mouse-adapted SARS-CoV obtained by passing the virus 15 times in mice (SARS-CoV-MA15) has been an excellent model as it reproduces very well the pathology caused by SARS-CoV in humans, including mortality (DeDiego et al., 2011, DeDiego et al., 2014b). In contrast, in the case of MERS-CoV, the virus was grown in Tg or knockin humanized mice susceptible to MERS-CoV (K. Li, P. McCray, and S. Perlman, 2016, personal communication).",

In these mice, the LD50 has been estimated to be < 10 TCID50 of MERS-CoV.

A major difference to the Tg mice described earlier is that the mouse-adapted MERS-CoV only produced disease in knockin mice after the virus has been passed 30 times in the knockin mouse (K. Li, P. McCray, and S. Perlman, 2016, personal communication), whereas the LD50 of MERS-CoV in these mice was around 104\n pfu/mouse. Another mouse lineage was generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology by altering mDPP4 amino acid residues 288 and 330 that are known to interact with the MERS-CoV S protein, leading to mice that closely reproduced the disease observed in humans, including mortality. In this case, the LD50 was around 106\n pfu/mouse (A. Crockrell and R. Baric, 2016, personal communication), significantly higher than that observed in the knockin mice (Cockrell et al., 2014, Peck et al., 2015, van Doremalen and Munster, 2015) and (K. Li, P.

Using these mice the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention (poly I:C) and a potential vaccine based on Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus has been demonstrated (Zhao et al., 2014a).

Several fragments of the MERS-CoV S protein were found to induce MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody responses in mice and rabbits (Du et al., 2013, Jiang et al., 2014, Ma et al., 2014b, Mou et al., 2013), similar to what has been shown previously for SARS-CoV (Du et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2012). The fragment-containing residues 377\u2013588 of MERS-CoV proved to be sufficient to protect Ad5/hDPP4-transduced and hDPP4-Tg mice against MERS-CoV. The immunogenicity of this fragment was further improved, resulting in strong humoral and cellular immune responses, by linking the fragment to human Fc and using an adjuvant (Tang et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2016). These reports confirm that the MERS-CoV S protein is very well suited for the development of MERS subunit vaccines. The full-length S protein contains several nonneutralizing immunodominant domains that may compromise the immunogenicity of major neutralizing domains or induce harmful immune responses as demonstrated for the S protein of SARS-CoV (Weingartl et al., 2004). Intranasal vaccination with the RBD domain of the MERS-CoV S protein induced much stronger local mucosal immune responses in the lung than subcutaneous immunization (Ma et al., 2014a). Other studies showed that full-length monomeric or trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins are able to induce protective responses in mice (Honda-Okubo et al., 2015, Li et al., 2013) and the presentation of MERS-CoV full-length S protein as nanoparticles in combination with appropriate adjuvants elicits neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice (Coleman et al., 2014a).",

In all cases, production of neutralizing antibodies with different levels of protection was observed. Challenge of mice with SARS-CoV was reported to cause Th2-type immunopathology, suggesting that SARS-CoV components induced hypersensitivity. Further studies suggested that the immunopathology leading to eosinophilia was linked, at least in part, to the viral nucleoprotein (Bolles et al., 2011). Also, immunization with oligomers of the SARS-CoV S protein were shown to promote eosinophilia following viral challenge in different animal model systems (Tseng et al., 2012), suggesting that potential side effects of vaccines based on inactivated SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV should be carefully evaluated prior to use in humans. Moreover, inactivated whole-virus vaccines raise biosafety concerns due to the risk of vaccine preparations containing infectious virus. To minimize this risk, genetically attenuated viruses may be used as the starting point for the production of killed virus inactivation.",

Vectors based on viruses from different families (poxvirus, adenovirus, measles, and togavirus (VEE)) have been used in the development of vaccines for CoVs. In the case of MERS-CoV, the most advanced and promising candidate is the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a viral vector that does not replicate in mammalian cells and, therefore, holds great promise as a vaccine platform (Altenburg et al., 2014, Haagmans et al., 2016, Song et al., 2013, Volz et al., 2015). Using this vector, S protein fragments of different length were expressed: full-length, extracellular S1 domain, or the RBD. In all cases, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses for MERS-CoV were induced. One of these vectors induced mucosal immunity and reduced the shedding of MERS-CoV by a factor of one thousand after challenge with the virulent virus in dromedary camels, thus preventing spread from the animal reservoir (Haagmans et al., 2016). An MVA-vectored vaccine will be entering clinical trials in 2016 supported by the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) (Paddock, 2015).",

            "text": "Virulence of CoVs is generally associated with specific virulence genes that, in most cases, antagonize cellular innate immune responses but are nor required for efficient virus replication. CoV infection affects many host-cell pathways that modulate pathogenesis. Innate immune response is the first line of host-cell defense against viruses, and any viral factor modulating this pathway may have a strong impact on pathogenesis. CoV proteins nsp3, 4, and 6 are actively involved in the formation of host membrane vesicles and structures that affect CoV replication and evasion of the immune system by hiding the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) generated during virus replication (Angelini et al., 2013). Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as ssRNA, dsRNA, or viral proteins, trigger the activation of transcription factors leading to proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFN induction. PAMPs activate protein kinase RNA-activated, which leads to translation initiation factor eIF2 phosphorylation and inhibition of host translation, and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthase (OAS), which triggers RNase L and RNA degradation (Fig. 2\n). The activation of cytoplasmic sensors RIG-I and MDA-5 triggers the upregulation of IFN regulatory factors (IRF)-3 and IRF-7, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) through mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (Fig. 2). In addition, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate the MyD88 response protein and adaptor molecule TRIF-dependent pathways, which also upregulate transcription factors IRF-3, IRF-7, NF-kB, and activator protein 1 (AP-1) (Fig. 2) (DeDiego et al., 2014a). Some CoV proteins act as IFN antagonists by inhibiting its production or signaling (Fig. 2) (DeDiego et al., 2014b, Totura and Baric, 2012, Zhong et al., 2012). Potent cytokines involved in controlling viral infections and priming adaptive immune responses are generated in response to CoV infection (Totura and Baric, 2012, Zhou et al., 2015). However, uncontrolled induction of these proinflammatory cytokines can also increase pathogenesis and disease severity as described for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (DeDiego et al., 2011, DeDiego et al., 2014a, DeDiego et al., 2014b, Selinger et al., 2014). The cellular pathways mediated by IRF-3, IRF-7, activating transcription factor (ATF)-2/jun, AP-1, NF-kB, and nuclear factor of activated T cells, are the main drivers of the inflammatory response triggered after SARS-CoV infection, with the NF-kB pathway most strongly activated (DeDiego et al., 2011). CoV proteins that elicit this type of innate immune response may be modified to generate attenuated viruses suitable for vaccine development.",

The methylation proved to be important to avoid viral RNA to be recognized as being \u201cnonself\u201d by the host-cell sensor MDA5 and subsequent activation of cellular innate immune responses. HCoV-229E mutants that lack 2\u2032-O-MTase activity replicated to 102-fold lower titers than the wild-type virus in MRC-5 cells, confirming the relevance of nsp16 activity. Moreover, the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant was more sensitive to treatment with type I IFN, and macrophages infected with the mutant virus produced more type I IFN than those infected with the parental virus (Zust et al., 2011). The role of nsp16 in modulation of innate immunity seems to be conserved among all CoVs, as similar results were obtained for MHV and SARS-CoV, and a SARS-CoV mutant lacking 2\u2032-O-MTase activity was attenuated in vivo (Menachery et al., 2014).",

            "text": "CoVs contain a variable number of genus-specific genes that have been implicated in modulation of pathogenesis. In fact, all common human CoVs contain a genus-specific gene located between the S and envelope (E) genes, named ORF4 (HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1), ORF3 (HCoV-NL63), or ns12.9 (HCoV-OC43) (Fig. 1). These genes encode transmembrane proteins that differ significantly in both their sequences and predicted structures (Muller et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2014b, Zhang et al., 2015), but may have related functions, such as ion channel activity and morphogenesis (Donaldson et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2014b, Zhang et al., 2015). In fact, the SARS-CoV 3a protein, HCoV-NL63 protein 3, and the HCoV-229E 4a protein are each able to complement in trans the absence of HCoV-OC43 ns12.9 protein (Zhang et al., 2015). The proteins are not essential for viral growth in cell culture but virus yield is increased between 6- and 25-fold if the protein is expressed (Zhang et al., 2014b, Zhang et al., 2015). Also, there is evidence that these protein homologs may play an important role in vivo. For example, all clinical isolates of HCoV-229E contain a full-length ORF4, while in cell culture-adapted strains, this gene is spontaneously divided into two ORFs, 4a and 4b, or replaced by a truncated ORF encoding only the first transmembrane domain (Dijkman et al., 2006). Recombinant HCoV-NL63-\u25b53 virus grows to a 10-fold lower titer than the parental virus in primary human airway epithelium (HAE) culture (Donaldson et al., 2008). Finally, a recombinant HCoV-OC43-\u25b5ns12.9 virus was attenuated in vivo (Zhang et al., 2015). These results suggest that ORF3 genes can be modified for the generation of attenuated viruses that may be used as vaccine candidates.",

Live-attenuated RNA virus vaccines are efficacious but subject to reversion to virulence. Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy, though reduced fidelity is detrimental for some viruses. The replication fidelity of CoVs has been estimated to be approximately 20-fold higher than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 exonuclease (ExoN) activity (Minskaia et al., 2006) that probably functions in RNA proofreading (Eckerle et al., 2010). It has been demonstrated that engineered abrogation of SARS-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity both in cell culture and in vivo, and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged, and immunocompromised mice (Graham et al., 2012). The ExoN null genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or long-term persistent infection in vivo. ExoN inactivation thus has potential for broad applications in the stable attenuation of CoVs.",

The importance of E in different CoV species and genera varies greatly, ranging from being absolutely essential in some members of the genera Alphacoronavirus (TGEV) and Betacoronavirus (lineage C, MERS-CoV) to having nonessential functions in other betacoronaviruses (MHV (lineage A), SARS-CoV (lineage B)). In SARS-CoV, two strategies have been used to abrogate E function: complete deletion of E protein, and the introduction of small deletions of 8\u201312 aa at the E protein carboxyl-terminus (Jimenez-Guardeno et al., 2015). A similar strategy is currently being applied to MERS-CoV (J. Gutierrez, I. Sola, and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results). The SARS-CoV E protein is nonessential for virus replication and dissemination, and its deletion has led to attenuated forms of SARS-CoV that are promising vaccine candidates (see later).",

The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live-attenuated vaccine based on a recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the E gene (rSARS-CoV-\u0394E) was first studied using hamsters. After immunization with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E, hamsters developed high serum neutralizing antibody titers and were protected from challenge with homologous (SARS-CoV Urbani) and heterologous (GD03) SARS-CoV in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Deletion of the E protein modestly diminished viral growth in cell culture but abrogated virulence in mice (Netland et al., 2010). We have shown that immunization with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E almost completely protected BALB/c mice from fatal respiratory disease caused by mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, and partly protected hACE2 Tg mice from lethal disease, although hACE2 Tg mice, which express the human SARS-CoV receptor, were extremely susceptible to infection. Furthermore, we also showed that rSARS-CoV-\u0394E induces antiviral T-cell and antibody responses. To improve vaccine efficacy, we engineered and adapted rSARS-CoV to efficiently grow in mice (rSARS-CoV-MA15). To this end, we incorporated six nucleotide substitutions into the SARS-CoV genome (Frieman et al., 2012, Roberts et al., 2007) using our reverse-genetics system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes. Using the rSARS-CoV-MA as a backbone genome, a second set of E-deletion vaccine candidates was generated (Fett et al., 2013). rSARS-CoV-MA15-\u0394E was safe, causing no disease in 6-week-, 12-month-, or 18-month-old BALB/c mice. Immunization with this virus completely protected mice at three ages from lethal disease and induced a more rapid virus clearance. Compared to rSARS-CoV-\u0394E, rSARS-CoV-MA-\u0394E immunization elicited significantly greater neutralizing antibody titers and virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. After challenge, inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and cell destruction were decreased in the lungs of rSARS-CoV-MA15-\u0394E-immunized mice, compared to those from rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-immunized 12-month-old mice, suggesting that this mouse-adapted virus is a safe candidate vaccine.",

            "text": "Ideally, a vaccine should provide full protection, and this was the case for the SARS-CoV vaccine candidate that was engineered by deleting the full-length E protein. Nevertheless, a good vaccine must also be genetically stable, and the initial rSARS-CoV-\u0394E vaccine was unstable both in cell culture and in vivo. In fact, this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passage in cell culture, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene, and while the chimeric protein increased viral fitness in vitro, the virus remained attenuated in mice. When the full-length E gene was deleted or its PBM coding sequence mutated, revertant viruses either evolved a novel chimeric gene including PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM in the E protein, respectively (Jimenez-Guardeno et al., 2015). During SARS-CoV-\u0394E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutant variant of the 8a protein including a PBM, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype. These data, and additional evidence, led us to conclude that the virus requires a PBM on a transmembrane protein to compensate the removal of this motif from the E protein (Jimenez-Guardeno et al., 2015). Therefore, to increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in the E gene that did not affect the endogenous PBM, preventing the selection of revertants incorporating novel PBMs into the virus genome and leading to a genetically and functionally stable vaccine candidate. To further increase vaccine safety, we introduced additional attenuating amino acid substitutions in the nsp1 protein. Recombinant viruses including attenuating mutations in the E and nsp1-coding sequences maintained their attenuation after passage in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these viruses fully protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus, and are therefore safe and stable vaccine candidates for protection against SARS-CoV (Jimenez-Guardeno et al., 2015).",

Two main strategies have been applied, either the expression of individual virus proteins or the deletion of appropriate protein-coding sequences from the full-length virus genome. Using the first approach, overexpressing MERS-CoV proteins in human 293T transfected cells, the structural, and accessory proteins M, 4a, 4b, and 5 were identified as potential IFN antagonists (Matthews et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2013). In contrast, when the role of these virus proteins was analyzed in cells infected with MERS-CoV deletion mutants in which individual genes (3, 4a, 4b, and 5, respectively) were deleted, it was observed that, among these proteins, 4b was the major antagonist of the innate immune response induction (J. Canton, S. Perlman, L. Enjuanes, and I. Sola, 2016, unpublished results). Deletion of ORF4a resulted in a MERS-CoV mutant with increased INF sensitivity. The effect may be associated with the dsRNA-binding domain of the 4a protein that was shown to interact with PACT in an RNA-dependent manner; thereby, reducing the activation of RIG-I and MDA5 in overexpression assays (Siu et al., 2014b). Also, the combined deletion of the accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 in a recombinant MERS-CoV (rMERS-CoV-\u0394ORF3-5) showed a 1\u20131.5 log reduction in viral titer compared with the full-length MERS-CoV (Scobey et al., 2013). Therefore, engineering MERS-CoV with deletions in one or more genes could lead to promising vaccine candidates.",

Because E protein induces cell apoptosis (An et al., 1999, DeDiego et al., 2011), the establishment of stable cell lines constitutively expressing this protein to complement viruses lacking E protein has not been possible. To overcome this limitation, we have generated packaging cell lines that transiently express E protein in an inducible manner and used them to grow replication-competent propagation-defective MERS-CoV-\u0394E (J. Gutierrez-Alvarez, I. Sola, and L. Enjuanes, 2016, unpublished results). Additionally, fully stable transformed mammalian cells were generated in which E protein expression was under the control of an optimized Tet-On system for doxycycline-inducible gene expression, drastically reducing leaky expression (Das et al., 2016, Markusic et al., 2005) and (J.

Therefore, modification or deletion of the replicase gene sequences encoding these proteins may also lead to the generation of attenuated viruses.

Mutations introduced into the MERS-CoV PLP coding sequence to specifically disrupt ubiquitin binding without affecting viral polyprotein cleavage led to PLP variants without DUB activity that lost their wild-type ability to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation in reporter assays. These findings directly implicate DUB and deISGylating functions of PLP in the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity, and such modification may lead to attenuated MERS-CoV. In addition, PLP catalytic activity was required by both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV to reduce induction of endogenous proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells (Mielech et al., 2014), consistent with the important functions of ubiquitination and modification of cellular proteins by interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in regulating cellular innate immune pathways. On the other hand, it has been shown that the SARS-CoV PLP interferes with the formation of the signaling complexes including STING (stimulator of interferon genes), TRAF3, TBK1, and IKK\u025b; thus, preventing downstream phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of IRF3 mediated by STING and TBK1 (Fig. 2) (Chen et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2014). This inhibition is not dependent on the PLP catalytic activity (Chen et al., 2014).",

While all vaccines protected against lethal infection, addition of an adjuvant significantly increased serum neutralizing antibody titers and reduced lung virus titers on day 3 postchallenge. Whereas adjuvant-free or alum-formulated vaccines were associated with a significant increase in lung eosinophilic immunopathology on day 6 postchallenge, this was not seen in mice immunized with vaccines formulated with the delta-inulin adjuvant. The absence of eosinophilic immunopathology in vaccines containing delta-inulin adjuvants was found to correspond to enhanced T-cell IFN-\u03b3-recall responses rather than reduced IL-4 responses, suggesting that immunopathology is primarily caused by an inadequate vaccine-induced Th1 response and illustrating the need to induce durable IFN-\u03b3 responses using appropriate adjuvants.",

Nevertheless, there are several antiviral compounds in preclinical development that may be useful to control human CoV infections (Adedeji and Sarafianos, 2014, Zumla et al., 2016). A number of these compounds target highly conserved replicase proteins, and therefore should be effective against a broad range of CoVs, including common human CoVs. Key enzymatic activities, such as the viral main protease, PLP, and helicase have been employed as targets for CoV-specific antiviral drugs (Kilianski and Baker, 2014). These conserved antiviral targets are generally thought to tolerate fewer mutations compared to structural protein genes due to higher fitness pressure; thus, possibly reducing the risk of resistant variants emerging rapidly during antiviral treatment.",

As a consequence, the development of technologies suitable to respond swiftly to newly emerging CoVs by producing vaccines is highly desirable. This goal could be achieved with the production of subunit or inactivated vaccines, but optimal combinations of antigen and adjuvant need to be established to minimize the risk of ADEI or eosinophilia that frequently occurred with CoV vaccines developed in the past. We believe that the vaccines of the future will be mainly based on live-attenuated viruses because of their superior potential to induce balanced Th1/Th2 immune responses, the potent and long-lasting immunity, and the comprehensive B and T-cell repertoire induced by this type of vaccines. However, the development of safe live-attenuated virus vaccines requires strong experimental support to confirm sufficient attenuation in the target species, possibly resulting in longer development and production times.",
