Tuttle (*) 5000 Mission Oaks Blud., #41, Austin , TX 78735, In May 1976, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began offi cially issuing DDT for poisoning bats in buildings that not only needlessly harmed bats but created far greater public health risks than the bats themselves (Barclay et al. 1980 ; Brass 1994 ; Kunz et al. 1977 ; Trimarchi 1978 ) . Denny Constantine, the leading authority on bat rabies, condemned the nationwide drive to create hysteria and the resulting use of exceptionally dangerous chemicals to kill bats. He concluded that \"The public health problems posed by bats are relatively insignifi cant compared to the public health problems usually initiated by those who publicize bats as problematic, typically resulting in an exaggerated, inappropriate response, damaging to the public health\" (Tuttle 1988a ) .",

Furthermore, since numerous bat populations have been in steady decline for decades as a result of overhunting, some being driven to extinction up to 100 years ago (Pierson and Rainey 1992 ; Racey and Entwistle 2003 ) , it is unlikely that humans are at greater risk today than in the past. Surprisingly, not even guano mining in major, occupied bat caves has been identifi ed as a source of human illness. Clearly, bats have a remarkable safety record. The story of bats in Austin, Texas, provides an excellent example of how bats and humans can safely coexist when bat conservationists, educators, and public health offi cials cooperate in presenting a balanced message. In the early 1980s, as 1.5 million Brazilian free-tailed bats ( Tadarida brasiliensis ) began moving into newly created crevices beneath the Congress Avenue Bridge at city center, public health offi cials warned that they were rabid and dangerous. Sensational news stories made national headlines. People panicked, and the bats were nearly eradicated. BCI met with leadership individuals in the health department, city government, and local news media, gaining their cooperation to present a balanced educational message, not scaring people, but warning them not to handle bats. As a result, the community has benefi tted greatly. The bats consume 15 tons of insects nightly and attract 12 million tourist dollars each summer. Furthermore, not one of millions of bat watching visitors has contracted a disease despite extraordinarily close association.",

            "text": "Several effective approaches for controlling vampires are now available, but too often nothing is done till after livestock begin to die of rabies making it too late to prevent an outbreak from running its course. Vaccines can provide protection when administered prior to an outbreak, and application of an anticoagulant (often chlorophacinone, diphacinone, or warfarin) mixed with Vaseline, either to wounds where vampires return to feed or to the bodies of vampires captured and released, can be highly effective ( Fig. 18 .5 ). Application on bite wounds works best for campesinos with relatively few animals in that it kills only the offending individuals, whereas pasting captured/released vampires works best for larger ranches. Through mutual grooming one pasted bat can kill up to 40 others (Brass 1994 ; Lord 1988 ). The latter method should be utilized only by trained teams working in front of advancing rabies outbreaks to create barriers against further spread. Limited studies have indicated negligible impacts on carnivores and scavengers who may eat poisoned vampires, though potential unintended consequences should be monitored (Brass 1994 ; Burns and Bullard 1979 ; Lord 1988 ) . As is, most humans can be protected from vampire bits by screening windows or by mosquito nets, backed up by vaccination when bites occur (Lopez et al. 1992 ; Peters 2004 ; Schneider et al. 2009 ). Unfortunately, education on appropriate controls has lagged far behind scientifi c knowledge (Brass 1994 ; Lord 1988 ) , even though education to easily identify vampire bats can be highly effective in solving most problems (Brass 1994 ) . BCI recruited two of Latin America's foremost authorities on vampire control, Rexford Lord of Venezuela and Hugo Sancho of Costa Rica, to produce a 26-min video, titled Control del Murcielago Vampiro y La Rabia Bovina , that covered the best available techniques for controlling problem vampires while also showing the importance of protecting benefi cial species (Walker 2002 ). Many vampire control personnel became collaborators in bat conservation.",

Teamed with botanist Paul Cox and private funders, Verne and Marion Read, we were able to enlist the hunters' enthusiastic collaboration in gaining hunting regulations and eventually a national park to protect the bats' habitat. Though we hated seeing these bats shot, protecting suffi cient numbers for future generations to hunt was better than trying to force cessation of all hunting and almost certainly failing.",

Working with owners of caves occupied by endangered gray bats ( Myotis grisescens ), I will never forget one who asked me to kill all the bats. I picked up a handful of potato beetle wings the bats had discarded beneath their roost and, on exiting, asked if he knew what kind of insect they were from. I had noticed he was growing potatoes and corn nearby. Of course, he recognized some of his worst crop pests and was surprised that bats ate them. When he asked how many insects his colony ate, I estimated about 100 lb nightly but pointed out that they didn't just eat potato beetles. They likely also consumed corn-ear worm moths and mosquitoes. From then on, he was an ardent bat protector! More recently, responding to an urgent call to BCI for help from Norma Monfort, whose family owned an important bat cave in the Philippines that housed 1.8 million Rousettus geoffroyi , we found that several nearby caves had suffered 95-100 % losses due to overhunting (Fig. 18.7 ) .",

I examined thousands of mangos during harvest, interviewed growers, and conducted controlled experiments of fruit ripeness preferences of bats. Although many mangos were eaten nightly in orchards, none of them were commercially harvestable nor would captive bats of six species consume harvestable fruit even when deprived of other food (Fig. 18.11 ). Akberkhan Khan, the largest mango exporter in Kenya at the time, explained that mangos ripe enough to attract bats are too ripe for harvest, and by removing those mangos, bats reduce breeding opportunities for fruit fl y and fungal pests. Some growers often mistook bush baby and monkey tooth marks in harvestable fruit for bats. In Malaysia and Indonesia, growers of rambutan ( Nephelium lappaceum ), langsat ( Lansium domesticum ), and water chestnut ( Eugenia aquea ) reported that bats threatened crops only for the last few nights prior to harvest and that most problems could be avoided by using bright lights or fi res (Fujita and Tuttle 1991 ) . When growers and government offi cials lack knowledge, serious harm can be infl icted. In 1958, Israeli government offi cials began fumigating caves used by Rousettus aegyptiacus using ethylene dibromide and later lindane, in response to fruit grower complaints. Entire cave ecosystems were lost as were approximately 90 % of insect-eating species followed by population explosion of noctuid moths that caused major crop damage (Makin and Mendelssohn 1985 ) . Massive eradications were also carried out in Cyprus (Hadjisterkotis 2006 ) . Unfortunately, fruit bats are still classifi ed as vermin (Singaravelan et al. 2009 ) even in countries like Australia where much progress has been made. The New South Wales Farmers Association recently called for a government cull of endangered fl ying foxes (Cox 2011 ) .

Unfortunately, early efforts to reverse decline focused almost entirely on protecting hibernation caves from human disturbance, with little or no regard for restoring altered microclimates. Also, substantial efforts were made to protect caves where relatively large numbers of desperate bats were barely surviving marginal conditions. When populations were compared over a 20-year period, those whose roosting temperatures fell within the species' preferred range increased, whereas those that did not declined alarmingly.
