            "text": "A number of effective models have been developed for simulating chemical transport in porous media; however, when a reactive chemical problem comprises multiple species within a substantial domain for a long period of time, the computational cost can become prohibitively expensive. This issue is addressed here by proposing a new numerical procedure to reduce the number of transport equations to be solved. This new problem reduction scheme (PRS) uses a predictor-corrector approach, which \"predicts\" the transport of a set of non-indicator species using results from a set of indicator species before \"correcting\" the non-indicator concentrations using a mass balance error measure.",

The application of the scheme to the intermediate-sized problems considered in the present study showed reductions of up to 82% in CPU time, with good levels of accuracy maintained.",

To this end, a significant number of numerical transport models have been developed. Typically, these are coupled models that consider advection and hydrodynamic dispersion, the latter of which comprises both mechanical dispersion and self-diffusion 1 of the chemical species coupled with heat flow and, often, the mechanical behavior of the medium. In addition to these flow and deformation processes, the solute can also be considered to be either reactive or nonreactive depending on the nature of the problem considered.",

            "text": "The application of these models has varied considerably, with many studies concentrating on geochemical problems, such as modeling groundwater systems, 2-6 assessing the performance of engineered barriers, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] or attenuation of mine water tailings. [12] [13] [14] The application of these models to cementitious materials has most often investigated the ingress of chloride ions [15] [16] [17] [18] or calcium leaching 19, 20 ; however, recently, these models have also been used for the investigation of self-healing concrete. 21, 22 One of the major disadvantages of these models is that they can become computationally expensive when the chemical system becomes relatively large. Cleall et al 23 suggest that the magnitude of a problem is governed by three main aspects, namely, the domain size, timescale, and the complexity of the analysis, which includes the number of variables, the degree of coupling between them, the number of processes considered, and the degree of nonlinearity of the system. The degree of nonlinearity depends on the underlying physical processes; for example, the system will be highly nonlinear if the reactions are sensitive to small changes in concentration or the permeability of the porous medium is sensitive to the degree of saturation. To deal with this issue, several techniques have been proposed to improve the computational efficiency of the associated solution process, including \"operator splitting\" techniques and reformulation of the coupled system. Operator splitting divides or \"splits\" a time step into a transport calculation and a reaction calculation, to be solved sequentially, with many models iterating between the two. This is an approximation of the time integral of the governing equation, 24 which therefore changes the numerical framework from a global implicit approach to a sequential iterative or a sequential non-iterative approach. Such calculation splitting methods have been found to reduce the computational cost 25 and have been used by many authors. [2] [3] [4] [8] [9] [10] [11] A disadvantage of the sequential non-iterative approach is its propensity to introduce splitting errors (for example, mass balance errors), whereas the sequential iterative approach tends to require prohibitively small time steps and a relatively large number of iterations to achieve convergence. 26, 27 Consequentially, these operator splitting approaches have been found to increase computational demand for certain \"chemically difficult\" cases (for example, cases with high kinetic reaction rates). 27, 28 A number of authors have taken an alternative approach, concentrating instead on improving the efficiency of global implicit approaches. Most studies have focused on reformulating the system by decoupling a number of the partial differential equations (PDEs) and eliminating certain local (spatially invariant) equations, including both ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations. 26, 27, [29] [30] [31] A common assumption used in such formulations is that all chemical species have the same diffusion coefficient. 26, 27 This has been justified by the fact that predicted responses are relatively insensitive to differences in diffusion constants because mechanical dispersion is normally the dominant transport mechanism. 27 An alternative view was expressed by Thomas et al, 10 who suggested that this assumption is not valid for some chemical systems. The presence of minerals, whose concentrations can reach zero, may also cause issues when such schemes are used, 26 although Kr\u00e4utle and Knabner 26 have introduced a moving boundary condition (BC) and a complimentary function to alleviate these difficulties.",

To address this issue, an indicator-based multi-order problem reduction scheme (PRS) is proposed, which allows for greater reduction in problem size that is independent of the nature of reactions and which explicitly considers species-dependent diffusion coefficients. The scheme works by decoupling a number of the nonlinear PDEs from the global system of equations. In this new PRS, a small number of indicator species (\u2264 3) are selected for full computation, and then, on a stepwise basis, the response of other species is inferred from these indicators using a predictor-corrector approach. The reduction in computational demand is achieved through the reduction in size of the nonlinear global system of equations and by the replacement of nonlinear PDEs with stepwise predictor-corrector computations for non-indicator species. Three different orders of the PRS are considered, each applicable to different chemical systems. The new PRS is presented along with a study to establish the range of applicability of each order considered. This is followed by a set of validation examples in which the reactive transport of chemical species through mortar and concrete specimens is simulated.",

This ensures that the computed responses of all non-indicator species are bounded by those of fully computed species. For PRS2, which requires a third indicator species, it was found, following an error analysis and sensitivity study (see Section 6.2), that the greatest accuracy was achieved by using a third indicator species with a mean diffusion coefficient. In cases where such a real species is not available, artificial species can be used. Artificial indicator species may also be used for other reasons; for example, as mentioned above, PRS1 and PRS2 use indicator species with the highest and lowest diffusion coefficients. However, the presence of any reactions associated with one of the bounding species, with reaction rates of the same order as (or higher than) those of the transport processes, may alter its rate of transport, such that it may no longer be the highest/lowest. In such situations, a nonreactive artificial indicator should be used in its place, thereby maintaining the solution bound. The criterion used to select the single indicator species required for PRS0 is given in Section 6.2 Another aspect of reactive transport problems, which is relevant to the choice of the indicator species, is that the transport of different species can take place over very different timescales. When this occurs due to a dominant (or \"sufficiently fast\" 38 ) reaction linked to a particular non-indicator species, this is dealt with by modeling the process as an equilibrium reaction. If this is due to other factors, then indicator species could be chosen to represent each different timescale.",

            "text": "The purpose of the reduction schemes is to reduce the computational cost of solving reactive chemical transport problems. In the above examples, the computational time for solving the problems with PRSs was substantially less than that of the associated full solutions. In order to quantify the reduction in computational cost, CPU times from each of the example problems presented in Sections 6 and 7 using the PRS are compared with those from a full solution. This analysis was performed on a PC with an Intel Core i7-7700HQ at 2.80 GHz and 15.9 GB of usable RAM. The CPU time of the time-step loop was measured for a number of runs, and an average was taken. The results for each of the problems considered are given in Tables 13 and 14 . It can be seen from the table that the PRS achieves significant reductions in computational times for the example problems, with reductions being up to 82% of CPU time. The smallest reduction is 29% for the advection-dominant case (where the highly nonlinear moisture transport is responsible for the bulk of the computational cost). It can be seen from Table 14 that the implementation of the reduction scheme does not increase the number of Newton iterations required per time step. Table 14 also shows that the reduction in computational cost achieved by the scheme is a result of reducing the size of the nonlinear system through the reduction of the number of coupled nonlinear PDEs to be solved, as opposed to (40) and (41)) makes this part of the model readily parallelizable, and, in addition to this, the model is compatible with domain decomposition methods, both of which would reduce the computational cost further. Finally, it is noted that the reduction in total solution times gained from using the proposed PRS may depend on the moisture transport model employed and on whether or not temperature is included as a primary variable. In the present case, the authors considered isothermal problems and have used a single degree of freedom (P c ) to simulate moisture flow, whereas Gawin et al 32 employed two degrees of freedom in their moisture transport model. The authors expect that the reduction gained, relative to a full model solution, from reducing the number of chemical species that are primary variables would be different if a temperature-dependent two-variable moisture model had been used. However, we believe that the use of the PRS will always result in a substantial reduction in CPU time (for any practical engineering problem) when the number of primary chemical species is reduced significantly.",
