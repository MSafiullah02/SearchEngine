            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses taxonomically affiliated with the Coronaviridae family (Lai et al., 2007). Based on genotypic and serological characteristics, coronaviruses are further classified into four species: Alpha, Beta, Gamma (King et al., 2012), and Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2009). Both alpha (alphaCoVs) and betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) can cause human diseases (Lai et al., 2007). Most human infections related to alpha and betaCoVs, such as coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1 (reviewed in Wevers and van der Hoek, 2009), which commonly manifest as self-limiting common cold-like illnesses, though more severe diseases can develop in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients (Chiu et al., 2005, Gorse et al., 2009, Jean et al., 2013, Jev\u0161nik et al., 2012). BetaCoVs, however, can also be life threatening and have pandemic potential (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Zaki et al., 2012). In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a lineage B betaCoV (Lu and Liu, 2012), caused >8,000 infections and >800 deaths worldwide (WHO, 2004). In 2012, another lineage C betaCoV named the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (King et al., 2012) initially emerged in Saudi Arabia (Bermingham et al., 2012, Zaki et al., 2012) and then spread to other countries in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and the US, leading to 701 confirmed cases as of June 16th, 2014 (WHO, 2014) with a fatality rate of approximately 35%. These unexpected outbreaks highlight the public health significance of betaCoVs, especially those in lineages B and C.",

            "text": "In addition to MERS-CoV, lineage C betaCoVs include two other important members: the bat coronaviruses (BatCoVs) HKU4 and HKU5 (Lu and Liu, 2012). These viruses were first identified as genomes in 2006 in lesser bamboo bats (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelles (Pipistrellus abramus), respectively (Woo et al., 2006), and remain circulating in bats (Lau et al., 2013). Bats have been implicated as the largest reservoir of alpha and betaCoVs (Li et al., 2005b, Woo et al., 2012) and play pivotal roles in interspecies transmission of coronaviruses. This is best exemplified by SARS-CoV, which was recently shown to originate from Chinese horseshoe bats (Ge et al., 2013) and likely transmitted directly to humans (Ge et al., 2013) or through an intermediate host such as the palm civet (Guan et al., 2003). The emergent MERS-CoV might also be of bat origin, with gene fragments being identified in bats from both Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2013) and Africa (Ithete et al., 2013) that are nearly identical to those of MERS-CoV in sequence. Despite the fact that the BatCoVs HKU4 and HKU5 are bat derived, the potential of both viruses evolving for human adaptation cannot be excluded because of their close phylogenetic relationship with MERS-CoV (Lau et al., 2013, Lu and Liu, 2012, van Boheemen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, such presumptions are largely based on their genomic features and phylogenetic status (Lau et al., 2013, Woo et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2007).",

The latter engages the receptor and is therefore also designated as the receptor binding motif (RBM) (Lu et al., 2013). Despite the overall high sequence identities in S, amino acid variance in the RBD region, especially in the RBM region, is still obvious among BatCoV HKU4, HKU5, and MERS-CoV.

The binding affinity between HKU4-RBD and hCD26 was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to be within the micromolar range. Despite the observed lower affinity compared to that between the MERS-CoV RBD (MERS-RBD) and hCD26, we found that pseudoviruses containing BatCoV HKU4 S can infect human Huh7 cells via hCD26. The findings provided solid evidence that BatCoV HKU4 recognizes hCD26 as a cellular receptor, indicating its potential for adaptation to infect humans. We further solved the complex structure of HKU4-RBD bound to hCD26 to delineate the basis of receptor recognition. Our structural analysis and mutagenesis also demonstrated a similar hCD26-binding mode between BatCoV HKU4 and MERS-CoV, but the details of variant amino acid interactions responsible for the differences in binding affinity are distinct. Our work also supports the notion that MERS-CoV most likely originated from bats.",

The phylogenetic relatedness between BatCoV HKU4/HKU5 and MERS-CoV (Figure 1\nA) prompted us to further investigate the equivalent RBD regions (S amino acids 372\u2013611 for BatCoV HKU4, HKU4-RBD; and 375\u2013604 for BatCoV HKU5, HKU5-RBD) in these bat-derived viruses for their potential to bind hCD26. A recent phylogenetic analysis of 13 BatCoV HKU4 and 15 BatCoV HKU5 strains revealed that the S gene of MERS-CoV is more closely related to BatCoV HKU4 than to BatCoV HKU5 (Lau et al., 2013). Using only the RBD amino acids, a concise phylogenetic tree was constructed, and a sequence alignment comparison was performed among BatCoV HKU4, HKU5, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. Consistently, BatCoV HKU4 clustered with MERS-CoV with high bootstrap support, together joining BatCoV HKU5 to form an evolutionary branch distant from SARS-CoV (Figure 1A). At the sequence level, MERS-RBD exhibits identity to HKU4-RBD slightly higher than HKU5-RBD does (54.4% versus 52.9%). Nevertheless, the pairwise alignment clearly showed two marked deletions located in a region corresponding to the external subdomain of MERS-RBD in HKU5-RBD, but not in HKU4-RBD (Figure 1B). According to our previous study (Lu et al., 2013), this subdomain is responsible for receptor recognition. Therefore, we hypothesized that BatCoV HKU4 stands a better chance than BatCoV HKU5 of engaging hCD26.",

Consistent with previous reports (Raj et al., 2013), Huh7 cells express abundant hCD26 protein on their membrane surface (Figure 2\nA). MERS-RBD, as a natural viral ligand of hCD26, avidly binds to Huh7 cells. HKU4-RBD, but not HKU5-RBD, also bound to Huh7 cells (Figure 2B). Compared to MERS-RBD, however, an evidently smaller fluorescence shift was observed for HKU4-RBD, indicating a lower binding potency than MERS-RBD. An hCD26-specific antibody rather than an isocontrol immunoglobulin G (IgG) blocked the Huh7 surface attachment by HKU4-RBD (Figure 2C). The observed Huh7 binding was also inhibited by the soluble ectodomain protein of hCD26, but not by the extracellular fragment of the SARS-CoV receptor hACE2 (Figure 2D). We also utilized the hCD26-negative BHK cell line in the binding assay. As expected, surface binding to BHK cells could only be observed for HKU4-RBD and MERS-RBD after transfection of the cells with an hCD26-expressing plasmid (Figures 2E\u20132H). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrated that BatCoV HKU4, unlike its close relative BatCoV HKU5, is capable of binding to hCD26 via the spike-RBD region.",

However, in contrast to the control pairs showing slow on and off rates, the Biacore binding profile between HKU4-RBD and hCD26 revealed fast association/dissociation kinetics. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of HKU4-RBD binding to hCD26 was calculated to be 35.7 \u03bcM (Figures 3C and S2), which is approximately three orders of magnitude lower than that of MERS-RBD to hCD26 (Lu et al., 2013).

Noting the inefficient S proteolysis in the BatCoV HKU4 pseudoviruses above, we hypothesized that in vitro treatment of the virus particles with proteases such as trypsin might activate the S protein, enabling viral entry into the cells upon receptor recognition. Therefore, the harvested BatCoV HKU4 pseudovirus particles were treated with various concentrations of trypsin (2.5\u201340 \u03bcg/ml), incubated with fetal bovine serum to inactivate the trypsin, and then used to infect Huh7 cells. Proteolysis of the S protein was observed in a concentration-dependent manner for the pseudoviruses (Figure 4A). Accordingly, significant increases (>150-fold) in the luciferase activity were recorded for pseudoviruses pretreated with 10, 20, and 40 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin, demonstrating successful entry into the cells (Figure 4B). Then, pseudoviruses digested with 10 \u03bcg/ml trypsin were used in the subsequent antibody blocking assays. As expected, a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell infection was observed using the hCD26 antibody that specifically blocked the Huh7 surface attachment of HKU4-RBD (Figure 4C). Therefore, we provided direct evidence that pseudoviruses bearing BatCoV HKU4 S infect human cells via hCD26 recognition.",

In the crystallographic asymmetric unit, HKU4-RBD and hCD26 were observed to form two 1:1 binding complexes that are related by a two-fold axis (Figure 5\nA). These two complexes are of essentially the same structure, showing a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of \u223c0.18 \u00c5 for all C\u03b1 pairs. For hCD26, clear electron densities could be traced for 727 amino acids from R40 to P766. As observed in previous reports (Engel et al., 2003), this human enzyme folds into two structural domains: an \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase domain and an eight-bladed \u03b2-propeller domain. hCD26 utilizes its propeller blades IV and V to recognize HKU4-RBD (Figures 5A and 5B). The two hCD26 molecules in the asymmetric unit were assembled into a dimer in the structure, with each protomer engaging one HKU4-RBD via its propeller. This leads to an overall U-shaped structure very similar to that observed for the MERS-RBD/hCD26 complex (Lu et al., 2013).",

Therefore, we scrutinized this extended buried surface to identify key amino acids involved in complex formation. Residues located within the van der Waals (vdw) contact distance (4.5 \u00c5 resolution cutoff) between HKU4-RBD and hCD26 were selected (Table S2), and a series of hydrophilic amino acids located along the interface were found to form a solid network of H bond and salt bridge interactions (Figures 5B and 5C). These strong polar contacts include the HKU4-RBD residue K506 interacting with the receptor amino acids T288 and A289, N514 and Q515 with R317, D516 with Y322, E541 and D542 with K267, and K547 with I295 (Figure 5C). In addition, several residues (such as Y460 located in helix \u03b72 of the RBD core subdomain) were further shown to contribute to the receptor binding by providing multiple vdw contacts (Table S2). It is notable that K506 and E541 of the viral ligand afforded both side-chain H bond and multi-vdw interactions in this network (Table S2). Thus, these residues were individually mutated to alanine, and the resultant HKU4-RBD mutants were tested for receptor binding using SPR assays. The calculated KDs for the two mutants binding to hCD26 were >400 \u03bcM, which is an \u223c10-fold decrease in binding affinity compared to that of the wild-type protein (Figures 2F, 2G, and S2), demonstrating their important roles in receptor recognition. Interestingly, these two amino acids are conserved between HKU4-RBD and MERS-RBD (Figure 1B) and are also involved in the binding of the MERS-CoV ligand to hCD26 (Lu et al., 2013).",

Most HKU4 residues in this region contact hCD26 less efficiently than the corresponding MERS-RBD amino acids. Among these, the S540/W535 and K547/R542 pairs in the \u03b28 strand and the L558/W553 pair in the \u03b29 strand are most evident, each showing \u223c20\u201330 contact differences (Figures 6B and 6C). Reminiscent of the low binding affinity of HKU4-RBD to hCD26, these three residues in HKU4-RBD were mutated to the MERS-RBD amino acids, and the resultant mutant protein was tested for receptor binding by SPR. The calculated dissociation constant for this triple mutant was 0.42 \u03bcM, indicating that its binding affinity is \u223c100-fold greater than that of the wild-type parental protein. In addition, the mutation also shifted the binding kinetics from a fast-on/fast-off mode, as observed for the wild-type HKU4-RBD, to a slow-on/slow-off mode, as observed for the MERS-RBD (Figures 2H and S2). We believe that the resultant introduction of extra vdw contacts and hydrophobic interactions by substituting these three residues in HKU4-RBD with more hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., tryptophan) led to the change in the binding kinetics. A similar phenomenon of altered Kon and/or Koff rates resulting from changes in hydrophobic interaction has also previously been observed in other protein interactions (Weihofen et al., 2004).",

Identification of the cellular receptors for a virus is therefore a key question in viral pathogenesis studies. The BatCoVs HKU4 and HKU5 represent two important bat-derived coronaviruses closely related to MERS-CoV (Lau et al., 2013, van Boheemen et al., 2012). In this study, we performed a functional assay to identify potential receptors for these viruses. We found that HKU4-RBD, a protein domain spanning residues 372\u2013611 of the BatCoV HKU4 S, but not the equivalent S region of BatCoV HKU5, binds to hCD26. In addition, the complex structure of HKU4-RBD bound to hCD26 was solved, demonstrating a receptor recognition mode similar to that observed for MERS-RBD, though with variant amino acid interaction details and a low binding affinity. We further showed that lentivirus particles pseudotyped with BatCoV HKU4 S could infect Huh7 cells via engagement of hCD26. Taken together, we provide the comprehensive data showing that hCD26 is also a functional receptor for the bat-derived HKU4 coronavirus. In support of this, a similar study of the functional reactivity of BatCoV HKU4 S for hCD26 was recently reported online (Yang et al., 2014) during the revision of our manuscript.",

Activation of the subsequent membrane fusion process requires, in most cases, proteolysis of the fusion proteins by host cell proteases. This proteolytic process either occurs during or after maturation of the viruses, such as with murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (Frana et al., 1985) and MERS-CoV (Gierer et al., 2013), or occurs during viral entry, such as with SARS-CoV (Simmons et al., 2013). When we analyzed the lentivirus particles, the pseudotyped BatCoV HKU4 S was predominantly uncleaved. Accordingly, we initially were unable to observe any infection of Huh7 cells by the HKU4 pseudoviruses. However, by mimicking the maturation process of MERS-CoV, we showed that treatment of the pseudoviruses with trypsin enabled hCD26-mediated Huh7 infection. These results demonstrated that engagement of a receptor by, and proteolytic activation of, the envelope S protein remain two prerequisite factors for BatCoV HKU4 infection, as with other coronaviruses (Simmons et al., 2013). By identifying hCD26 as a functional receptor for BatCoV HKU4, the spatiotemporal processing of its S protein to allow subsequent membrane fusion remains an unresolved issue that should be further explored in the future.",

Bats are natural reservoirs of many alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, which provide viral genes for the genesis of newly emerging coronaviruses with interspecies transmission potential. Phylogenetic dating suggests three suspected interspecies jumps of animal betaCoVs into humans, two of which (the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) are very likely of bat origin (Ge et al., 2013, Ithete et al., 2013, Li et al., 2005b, Memish et al., 2013) and were circulating in bats before they \u201cjumped\u201d to an intermediate host (e.g., civets for SARS-CoV and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV) and/or to humans (Ge et al., 2013, Guan et al., 2003, Haagmans et al., 2014, Reusken et al., 2013). A recent study demonstrates the circulation of BatCoV HKU4 in bats in the past years (Lau et al., 2013). With the data in this study, we found that BatCoV HKU4 has evolved to utilize hCD26 as a functional receptor and therefore gained one of the key factors sufficing for interspecies transmission and human infection. This highlights the necessity for a surveillance program to monitor HKU4 circulation in bats. Special attention should be paid to virus variants incorporating mutations in S that would increase their affinity for hCD26 and/or confer susceptibility to host protease cleavage.",

Among these, BatCoV HKU4 likely represents a coronavirus suboptimized for receptor adaptation, displaying micromolar affinity for hCD26. Compared to MERS-CoV, which recognizes the same hCD26 molecule as a receptor (Raj et al., 2013), HKU4-RBD and MERS-RBD form similar structures and engage hCD26 via similar binding modes. Nevertheless, the two viral ligands exhibit a difference in receptor binding affinity of three orders of magnitude. We noted that in the RBM region predominating the ligand binding interface with the receptor, the majority of the interface residues in MERS-RBD contribute more vdw contacts than the equivalent amino acids in HKU4-RBD. This demonstrates a much better adaptation to hCD26 for MERS-CoV than for BatCoV HKU4, which was further supported by our mutagenesis data. We therefore presented the molecular basis for the observed affinity variance and a structural explanation for the suboptimized hCD26 binding by BatCoV HKU4. This weak binding also raises the possibility for the presence of other high-affinity receptors for BatCoV HKU4. Nevertheless, the physical interaction between HKU4-RBD and hCD26 seems to favor a scenario in which BatCoV HKU4 has evolved to adapt to the human receptor. In this sense, we cannot rule out the possibility that this bat-derived virus has been exposed, at some stage, to humans or human tissues.",

The marked difference between the HKU4-RBD and HKU5-RBD relative to MERS-RBD, however, lies in two sequence deletions in the HKU5-RBD. Both deletions are located in the external subdomain and in two regions corresponding to the scaffold strands \u03b27 and \u03b28 in the MERS/HKU4-RBD structure. The deletions would therefore alter the fold of HKU5-RBM and abolish its interaction with hCD26. Similar amino acid deletions that exclude the viral ligand from interacting with hACE2 have also been recorded for diverse SARS-like coronaviruses identified in bats (Ren et al., 2008). An intact full-length external subdomain is likely a prerequisite to maintain binding capacity for hCD26 or hACE2, in addition to preserving key interacting residues, such as K506 and E541 in HKU4-RBD.",
