            "text": "Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most convincing technique for locating the specific DNA sequences, diagnosis of genetic diseases, gene mapping, and identification of novel oncogenes or genetic aberrations contributing to various types of cancers. FISH involves annealing of DNA or RNA probes attached to a fluorescent reporter molecule with specific target sequence of sample DNA, which can be followed under fluorescence microscopy. The technique has lately been expanded to enable screening of the whole genome simultaneously through multicolor whole chromosome probe techniques such as multiplex FISH or spectral karyotyping or through an array-based method using comparative genomic hybridization. FISH has completely revolutionized the field of cytogenetics and has now been recognized as a reliable diagnostic and discovery tool in the fight against genetic diseases.",

These techniques have been successfully applied to both animals and plants. RNA probes can be designed for any gene or any sequence within a gene for visualization of mRNA, long noncoding RNA and miRNA in tissues and cells. These probes, often derived from the fragments of DNA that were isolated, purified, and amplified for use in Human Genome Project, consist of about 20 oligonucleotide pairs and cover a space of 40-50 bp of target RNA. In 1982, a new method was described to localize DNA sequences hybridized in situ to chromosome. This method utilized a biotinlabeled analogue of thymidine (TTP) which could be incorporated enzymatically into DNA probes by nick translation. The sites of hybridization were detected either cytochemically by using avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, or fluorometrically by using fluorescein-labeled antibodies. Compared to autoradiography this technique decreased the time required for detection, improved resolution, and gave less non-specific background and chemically stable hybridization probes.",

In this technique, genomic DNA from one species is used as the labeled probe, while unlabeled DNA from the other species under test is used as the Fig. 16 .1 Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) identification of human chromosomes through chromosome painting. DNA probes specific to regions of particular chromosomes are attached to fluorescent markers and hybridized with a chromosome spread. The picture shows a computergenerated \"false color\" image, in which small variations in fluorescence wavelength among probes are enhanced as distinct primary colors. The combination of probes that hybridize to a particular chromosome produces a unique pattern for each chromosome. This makes it particularly easy to detect segmental deletions and translocations among chromosomes (Taken from https://www.mun.ca/ biology/scarr/FISH_chromosome_painting.html) competitor at a much higher concentration ( Fig. 16 .2). The technique is very useful for cytological identification of foreign chromatin in interspecific hybrids at the molecular level. In plant molecular cytogenetics, GISH has also been used to detect parental genomes in natural allopolyploid species such as Millium montianum, Triticum aestivum, Aegilops triuncialis, and Nicotiana tabacum, and also alien segments in translocations. Now availability of several probe labeling procedures has enabled detection of two or more sequences in the same cell by using fluorochromes of different colors. Reid et al. (1992) were able to visualize seven different DNA probes on human metaphase chromosomes simultaneously by FISH using combinatorial fluorescence and digital imaging microscopy. The multicolor FISH technique has been extensively used in plant molecular cytogenetics. Leitch et al. (1991) demonstrated two highly repeated DNA sequences simultaneously in rye chromosomes. Mukai et al. (1993) , using multicolor FISH with total genomic probes and highly repeated sequences, reported simultaneous detection of three genomes of an allohexaploid wheat. The main steps involved in the genomic in situ hybridization are (a) direct or indirect labeling of probe, (b) blocking DNA fragmentation, (c) preparation of slide, (d) denaturation of probe and blocking DNA in a hybridization mixture, (e) addition of the probe and the blocking DNA with the hybridization mixture, (f) chromosome DNA denaturation, (g) hybridization of blocking DNA and probe in the target sequence of the chromosome, (h) detection of the probe in the chromosome of one parent, (i) chromosome DNA molecule of the second parent related to the unlabeled blocking DNA, and (j) visualization of hybridization signals in a fluorescence microscope. Unlabelled chromosomes are visualized with a counterstain (blue) (Taken from http://www. slideshare.net/kskuldeep1995/genomic-in-situ-hybridization)",

The probes are either labeled indirectly with a hapten or directly through incorporation of a fluorophore. The labeled probe and the target DNA are mixed together after denaturation, which allows annealing of complementary DNA sequences. In case the probe had been labeled indirectly, an extra step of enzymatic or immunological detection system will be required for visualization of the nonfluorescent hapten. Finally the signals are evaluated by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 16 .3). The enzymatic detection system involves fluorochrome, which emits colored signals at the hybridization site. The immunological detection system is based on binding of antibodies to specific antigens, which is then demonstrated with a colored histochemical reaction visible by light microscope or fluorochromes with ultraviolet light.",

            "text": "1. Chromosome painting refers to the hybridization of fluorescently labeled chromosome-specific composite probe pools to cytological preparations. This enables visualization of individual chromosomes in metaphase or interphase cells and the identification of chromosomal aberrations. The whole chromosome painting probes are complex DNA probes derived from a single type of chromosome that has been PCR amplified and labeled to generate a \"paint\" which homogeneously highlights the entire chromosome. With this probe, the cytologically visible structural and numerical chromosome rearrangement in metaphase becomes obvious. The chromosomal paint is, however, not helpful in the analysis of interphase cells. Whole chromosome painting is now available for every human chromosome, allowing the simultaneous painting of the entire genetic complement in 24 colors. This has led to the development of two independent FISH techniques -multicolor FISH (M-FISH) and spectral karyotyping (SKY)which have important diagnostic and research application values. 2. Repetitive sequence probes hybridize to specific chromosomal regions or structures that contain short sequences, which are present in many thousands of copies. For example, pan-telomeric probes target the tandemly repeated (TTAGGG) sequences present in all human chromosomes ends. Centromeric probes target the \u03b1-and \u03b2-satellite sequences, flanking the centromeres of human chromosomes. Satellite DNA probes hybridize to multiple copies of the repeat sequences present at the centromeres, resulting in two very bright fluorescent signals in both metaphase and interphase diploid cells. These centromere-specific probes are useful in detection of monosomy, trisomy, and other aneuploidies in leukemias and solid tumors ( Fig. 16.4 ). 3. Locus-specific probes are usually genomic clones, which vary in size depending on the nature of the cloning vector from plasmids (which can carry 1-10 kb) to the larger PAC (P1 bacteriophage-derived artificial chromosome, which can carry 100-300 kb), YAC (yeast artificial chromosome which can carry 150-350 kb), and RAC vectors (which can carry 80 kb to 1 Mb). These probes are particularly useful for detection of translocations, inversions, and deletions in both metaphase and interphase.",

            "text": "One of the most significant developments in FISH technology in relation to genomewide screening was the introduction of comparative genome hybridization (CGH) in 1992. IN CGH, the genomic DNA from the specimen and the control DNA extracted from an individual with a normal karyotype (46,XX or 46,XY) are differentially labeled with green and red fluorochromes, respectively, mixed in equal amounts and co-hybridized to reference human metaphase chromosomes (Fig. 16.10 ). The relative difference in DNA content between the normal and specimen DNA is represented by a difference in the green/red fluorescence ratios. For example, if the chromosomal material is present in identical copy numbers in both the reference and the specimen genome, the observed fluorescence is a blend of an equal contribution Fig. 16 .10 Comparative genomic hybridization. Genomic DNA is isolated from both the tumor sample and the normal reference sample, labeled with different fluorochromes and mixed in the presence of excess Cot-1 DNA to prevent binding of repetitive sequences. In conventional chromosomal CGH, these are hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes, and the ratio of fluorescence intensities along each chromosome is analyzed. Increased DNA copy number (amplification) in the tumor sample will be detected by increased red fluorescence, whereas decreased copy number in the tumor sample will allow more binding of the normal DNA and increased green fluorescence. On the right, a similar hybridization to a cDNA array permits measurement of copy number at a higher resolution. The red and green spots on the fluorescence image represent increased and decreased copy number changes, respectively (Taken from http://biohorizons.oxfordjournals.org/ content/early/2010/02/26/biohorizons.hzq009/F7.expansion.html) of red and green fluorescence. If chromosomes are lost or chromosomal subregions are deleted in the specimen genome, the resulting color is shifted to red. A gain in the certain chromosome in the specimen, such as amplification of oncogenes, is reflected by a more intense green staining of the respective chromosome in the reference metaphase preparation. The ratios of the test to reference fluorescence along the chromosomes are quantified using digital image analysis. In array CGH, metaphase chromosomes are replaced as the target by large number of mapped clones that are spotted onto a standard glass slide greatly increasing the resolution of screening for genome copy number gains and losses. In array CGH, the test and the normal reference genomes, which are used as probes, are differentially labeled and co-hybridized to a microarray before being imaged. The fluorescence intensities are calculated for each mapped clone, with the resulting intensity ratio reflecting the DNA copy number difference (Fig. 16.11) . Despite some limitations, array CGH has become one of the most widely used cytogenetic techniques in both basic research and molecular diagnosis. This technique has enabled us to understand that tumors of the same type have similar patterns of DNA gains and losses and that the frequency of changes increases with tumor progression.",

The use of RNA FISH for studying the intracellular localization of RNA has increased over understanding of in situ physical characteristics of DNA transcription and transport of RNA transcripts. Similarly FISH can be used to examine many interesting biological questions about nuclear organization. Three-dimensional nuclear DNA FISH can provide high-resolution information about sub-chromosomal domains, gene position, and the relationship of genes and their transcripts in different cells and during different stages of the cell cycle. Accurate analysis of three-dimensional FISH is highly dependent on excellent quality confocal microscopy and image analysis procedures.",
