            "text": "Background: The discovery of many fragments of viral genomes integrated in the genome of their eukaryotic host (endogenous viral elements; EVEs) has recently opened new avenues to further our understanding of viral evolution and of host-virus interactions. Here, we report the results of a comprehensive screen for EVEs in crustaceans. Following up on the recent discovery of EVEs in the terrestrial isopod, Armadillidium vulgare, we scanned the genomes of six crustacean species: a terrestrial isopod (Armadillidium nasatum), two water fleas (Daphnia pulex and D. pulicaria), two copepods (the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Eurytemora affinis), and a freshwater amphipod (Hyalella azteca). Results: In total, we found 210 EVEs representing 14 different lineages belonging to five different viral groups that are present in two to five species: Bunyaviridae (\u2212ssRNA), Circoviridae (ssDNA), Mononegavirales (\u2212ssRNA), Parvoviridae (ssDNA) and Totiviridae (dsRNA). The identification of shared orthologous insertions between A. nasatum and A. vulgare indicates that EVEs have been maintained over several millions of years, although we did not find any evidence supporting exaptation. Overall, the different degrees of EVE degradation (from none to >10 nonsense mutations) suggest that endogenization has been recurrent during the evolution of the various crustacean taxa. Our study is the first to report EVEs in D. pulicaria, E. affinis and H. azteca, many of which are likely to result from recent endogenization of currently circulating viruses. Conclusions: In conclusion, we have unearthed a large diversity of EVEs from crustacean genomes, and shown that four of the five viral groups we uncovered (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Mononegavirales, Parvoviridae) were and may still be present in three to four highly divergent crustacean taxa. In addition, the discovery of recent EVEs offers an interesting opportunity to characterize new exogenous viruses currently circulating in economically or ecologically important copepod species.",

Sequencing viral metagenomes from various environments has revealed that viruses are the most numerous and diverse organisms on Earth [2] [3] [4] and that, likely, only a small proportion of them are harmful pathogens. The results of these studies, coupled with the finding of many \"good viruses\", suggest viruses could now often be considered mutualistic symbionts, fully integrated in holobionts, which have been defined as organisms harboring and interacting with a diverse microbial community [5, 6] . Viruses are thought to be at least as old as cellular organisms and it is becoming increasingly clear that they have had a strong, long-lasting, and ongoing influence on the evolution of their hosts and on ecosystem function [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

            "text": "The recent discovery that many viral genomes integrate into the genome of their eukaryotic hosts has shed new light on our understanding of viral evolution and on the evolution of host-virus interactions [11, 12] . Paleovirology, the study of these endogenous viral elements (EVEs), has produced several major breakthroughs. First, we have learned that many extant viral families are much older than what was previously thought and that fast rates of evolution inferred from currently circulating viruses cannot be extrapolated over long evolutionary periods of time [12] . Other interesting outcomes of paleovirology studies include, much like viral metagenomics, the dramatic expansion of the host ranges for viral families. For example, in a recent study, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic screen for EVEs in the genome of a terrestrial crustacean isopod, the pill bug Armadillidium vulgare [13] . We uncovered 54 EVEs from 10 diverse lineages belonging to the Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae and Totiviridae families as well as to the Mononegavirales order, indicating that isopods have been and may still be exposed to a remarkable diversity of viruses. These findings extended the host range of all five viral groups to isopod crustaceans, and led to the question of whether A. vulgare is unique in terms of abundance and diversity of EVEs among crustaceans or if a diverse EVE biota is characteristic of the group as a whole. In order to address this question, and to shed new light on the dynamics of viral endogenization more generally, we extended our screen to another species of terrestrial isopod (A. nasatum) and to five additional crustacean species (two species of water flea [Daphnia pulex and Daphnia pulicaria], a marine copepod [Eurytemora affinis], a freshwater amphipod [Hyalella azteca], and the salmon louse [Lepeophtheirus salmonis; Copepoda]; Additional file 1: Figure S1 ).",

Secondly, the method used to sequence the six crustacean genomes did not involve a reverse transcription step, and thus did not allow sequencing of any RNA molecule. Yet, many of the EVEs we found originate from exogenous RNA viruses (Bunyaviriridae, Mononegavirales and Totiviridae).

Regarding the mechanisms underlying integration of viral genomes into crustacean genomes, we could not detect any sequence signature indicative of transposition-mediated or microhomology-mediated insertion. However, we found that several EVEs share the same putative flanking region within a given species (Additional file 3: Table S2 ), indicating that they were likely generated by post-insertional duplication (one such duplication in E. affinis, in D. pulex, in H. azteca and in L. salmonis; three such events in D. pulicaria; Additional file 3: Table S2 ).",

The first one includes the H. azteca EVEs, which cluster with the recently described unclassified exogenous Wenzhou crab virus [18] (bootstrap value = 100) and one of the A. vulgare EVE lineages described in Th\u00e9z\u00e9 et al.

In the nucleocapsid phylogeny (Additional file 6: Figure  S3 ), the EVEs newly discovered in E. affinis, L. salmonis Fig. 1 Numbers of endogenous viral elements from each viral group in the six crustacean species screened in this study. The size of their respective genomes is written below the species names. EVE numbers for A. vulgare are taken from Th\u00e9z\u00e9 et al. [13] . It is noteworthy that several EVEs share the same putative flanking region within a given species (see Results section and Additional file 3: Table S2 ), indicating that they were likely generated by post-insertional duplication (seven such events in total). The total number of endogenization events producing the 210 EVEs identified in this study is therefore lower than 210 and H. azteca fall within the Rhabdoviridae family of exogenous viruses.",

In addition, invertebrate iridescent viruses (Iridoviridae; dsDNA) have been observed in four species of decapods, two species of maxillopods, two species of branchiopods and 18 species of isopods [34] . These viruses are relatively easy to detect because of the iridescent blue or red color of infected individuals [35] [36] [37] . Dunlap et al. [38] also described a circovirus infecting two ecologically important copepod species, and two new species of rhabdoviruses were recently characterized in the salmon louse [19] . We recently discovered EVEs in Armadillidium vulgare and showed that terrestrial crustacean isopods have been and may still be exposed to a large variety of viruses, many of which belong to viral lineages that had never been reported in crustaceans before [13] . Here, we show that members of all five viral groups found in A. vulgare (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Mononegavirales, Parvoviridae, Totiviridae) have also become endogenized in another terrestrial isopod, A. nasatum, and that four other crustacean species each harbor a viral flora composed of a subset of these five viral groups as well. Interestingly, all but one EVE lineage found in A. nasatum group with those previously identified in A. vulgare, which suggest that the two species are infected by the same viruses, an observation which is consistent with the fact that the distribution of the two species largely overlaps in Europe and that they are often found in the same habitats [39] . Overall, our phylogenetic analyses revealed that crustacean EVEs tend to group by taxa in distinct, well supported clusters across no fewer than 14 distinct viral lineages: four Bunyaviridae, five Mononegavirales (including a new Armadillidium lineage in A. nasatum), two Circoviridae, two Parvoviridae and one Totiviridae, 10 of which were also found in the initial screen of A. vulgare [13] .",

            "text": "Given the tremendously large diversity of viruses known to infect eukaryotes and the fact that we screened species that are widely divergent form each other and from A. vulgare, it is perhaps surprising that all new EVEs detected here belong to the same viral groups than those detected in A. vulgare (no additional viral family was detected) and that only four of the lineages reported here were not found in A. vulgare. This leads to three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (1) that these five viral groups are Fig. 2 simply the most widespread in crustaceans, (2) these viral groups are more likely to endogenize than other viruses without being more prevalent as exogenous viruses, or (3) that crustacean genomes are uniquely vulnerable to endogenization by these 5 groups, relative to other host genomes. We note that a member of at least one other viral family (Nimaviridae) has been unearthed from a crustacean genome [40] , and we believe that as more metagenomics and paleovirology studies are conducted, comparing global patterns of endogenization and global viral flora of extant viruses in a given taxonomic group will yield interesting insights into the ecology of host/virus interactions. But our current knowledge in this area is still too limited to draw any firm conclusion on this aspect of our results. Our alignment of crustacean EVEs to representative exogenous viruses from each of the five viral groups revealed that most EVE fragments (83 %) are from the polymerase, with the remaining fragments being derived from different open reading frames such as coat or nucleocapsid protein (Fig. 2) . Because this pattern is consistent throughout all five viral groups, we believe it is most likely explained by the strong purifying selection pressures acting on viral polymerases [41] [42] [43] [44] , leading to a high degree of conservation of such proteins between viruses that were endogenized and extant exogenous viruses. The other structural proteins (coat or capsid proteins) tend to be involved in more direct interactions with host factors (such as cell receptors) and are key to the entry of the virus in the cell. Thus, they are more likely to be engaged in an evolutionary arms race with the host and to evolve under rapid positive selection (e.g. [45, 46] ). The level of similarity of such proteins between endogenized viruses and extant ones is therefore expected to be lower than that observed for polymerases.",

            "text": "The crustacean EVEs detected in this study show various levels of degradation when compared to their closest exogenous virus relatives, some being intact or disrupted by just one or a few mutations inducing a stop codon and/or a frameshift and others being heavily degraded by more than 10 nonsense mutations (Additional file 3: Table S2 ). This pattern indicates that viral endogenization has been recurrent during the evolution of the taxa included in this study. Further suggesting recurrent endogenization over time, we identified three EVEs shared at orthologous loci between A. nasatum and two or three other Armadillidium species (Additional file 8: Figure S5 ), and we were unable to amplify three other EVEs by PCR in one or two A. nasatum individuals sampled from a different population than the one used for genome sequencing (Table 1 ). These data indicate that, while some EVEs are old and were endogenized before the split between A. nasatum and the other Armadillidium species, others are more recent and are likely to still be polymorphic (with respect to presence/absence patterns) in A. nasatum. The phylogenetic relationships of the three Armadillidium species included in our study have yet to be robustly resolved, but the mitochondrial COI gene from the two most distantly relatives (A. nasatum and A. vulgare, according to Dupeyron et al. [47] ) differ by 16 %. Considering the proposed COI substitution rate of 1.4 % per million years in decapods [48] , we can infer that the EVEs detected in isopods result from recurrent endogenization events that took place over several millions of years during the evolution of terrestrial isopods. The three EVEs that became endogenous in the ancestor of the A. nasatum + A. vulgare clade are all disrupted by one to four nonsense mutations and we did not find evidence for their transcription in the transcriptome of A. nasatum and A. vulgare [49] . Thus unlike previously described examples in non-crustacean taxa (e.g. [50, 51] ), these three isopod EVEs do not appear to evolve under purifying selection and to fulfill a cellular function. Their maintenance in isopod genomes over several millions of years is therefore either completely neutral or due to initial exaptation, followed by loss of function and ongoing degradation as proposed for Syncytin genes in primates [52] .",

Viruses have an important impact on the structure and ecology of phytoplankton communities [54] , and it has recently been suggested they may play an important role in shaping mesozooplankton communities as well [38] . In addition, there is evidence suggesting that copepods can serve as vectors for transmitting viruses to fish and shrimp, causing important economic losses [55, 56] , and to phytoplankton, with possible consequences on global biogeochemical cycling [57] . Despite these major consequences, only one study has characterized viral infections in copepods so far [38] .

            "text": "In conclusion, we characterized a large diversity of EVEs in crustacean genomes resulting from recurrent events of endogenization taking place over several millions of years. Most EVEs correspond to non-structural viral proteins, likely reflecting the slower rate of change of these proteins as compared to structural proteins. Interestingly, we found that four viral groups (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Mononegavirales, Parvoviridae) are widespread in crustaceans, being present in three to four highly divergent taxa (amphipods, copepods, isopods, branchiopods) and that all viral groups found in non-isopod crustaceans are present in isopods. We anticipate that further large scale paleovirology and metagenomics studies will shed light on the factors shaping global patterns of viral endogenizations and the composition of the viral communities currently circulating in a given taxonomic group. Finally, the sequences of recent EVEs that we identified in this study could facilitate the discovery of new exogenous viruses through targeted searches. The characterization of EVEs not only serves to provide a catalog of paleoviral events shedding light on past host-virus interactions but it can also help discovering new viruses in ecologically and/or economically important taxa (e.g. the copepods E. affinis and L. salmonis).",

The whole genome sequences of A. nasatum used in this study were generated as part of the ongoing A. nasatum genome project in our laboratory. Briefly, total genomic DNA was extracted from two A. nasatum individuals. A paired-end library with~230 bp inserts was prepared and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000. Reads were filtered with FastQC and assembled using the SOAP de novo software version 2.04 [58] . The best assembly was obtained with a kmer size of 61.

We then carried out tblastx similarity searches [60] on these genomes using all available viral genomes (n = 5678 as of April 2015) as queries. Crustacean sequences yielding tblastx hits were then parsed from the tblastx output and converted into a fasta file using a custom script. Many tblastx hits were false positives corresponding to repeated sequences or to eukaryote genes that are present in viruses following host-to-virus horizontal transfers, known to be common in large dsDNA viruses [13, [61] [62] [63] . In order to remove these false-positive sequences, a reciprocal blastp was carried out using the tblastx fasta output as query on the \"nr\" (non-redundant) Genbank protein database, to eliminate any sequences for which the best reciprocal blastp hit was not a virus. The remaining sequences were manually aligned to a reference viral genome in BioEdit 7.1.9 [64] in order to draw schematic maps to illustrate the viral genome fragments endogenized in crustacean genomes.",

This phylogenetic analysis included closely related viral sequences selected following the BLAST analysis with the addition of closelyrelated proteins of representative virus species (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, [17] ), as well as recently published sequences [18] for two viral groups (Bunyaviridae and Mononegavirales). Triple iteration amino acid sequence multiple alignments were generated using ClustalOmega software (version 1.2.1; [65] ).

We also investigated whether these EVEs are present at orthologous sites in three other closely related isopod species (A. depressum, A. tunisiense and A. vulgare). For this analysis, we selected the two EVEs of each viral group (four for Circoviridae because we found many more EVEs for this viral group) with the longest flanking regions. We then designed PCR primers to the flanking regions (Additional file 9: Table S3 ) and conducted a series of PCR screens on three A. nasatum DNA samples, one A. vulgare sample, one A. depressum sample, and one A. tunisiense sample. Genomic DNA extraction followed the Wilson protocol [68] which involved 3 h incubation of the tissue sample in proteinase-K at 56\u00b0C, centrifugation (8000 g, 2 min), and an RNAse treatment (30 min at 37\u00b0C). DNA samples were then purified using spin columns from the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). PCR reactions were carried out in 25 \u03bcl with 5 \u03bcL Buffer 5X, 0.5 \u03bcL dNTPs (2.15 mM), 1 \u03bcL of each primer (100 \u03bcM), 0.25 \u03bcL Taq polymerase 5 u/\u03bcL, 1 \u03bcL DNA. Thermocycling consisted of a 94\u00b0C phase for 4 min, then 30 cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 55\u00b0C and 50 s at 72\u00b0C, followed by a final extension step of 5 min at 72\u00b0C.

For this we used all A. nasatum EVEs flanked on one or both sides by at least 150 bp of sequence showing no similarity to any virus as queries to perform blastn searches on A. vulgare sequences (using the sequences published in Th\u00e9z\u00e9 et al. [13] ). Our identification of EVE flanking regions first relies on the fact that these regions are not similar to any known virus. In order to verify that they correspond to the host genome, we searched for the presence of known proteins motifs using these regions as queries to perform blastx searches against the Genbank non-redundant protein database. We also searched for the presence of interspersed repeats, which are typically abundant in eukaryotic genomes but very rare in viruses in general and absent from the genomes of Bunyaviridae and Circoviridae (the two viral families to which belong the three EVEs for which we found repeats in their flanking regions). For this we used each EVE flanking region as a query to perform blastn searches against the host genome it was extracted from. We considered interspersed repeats as regions longer than 100 bp repeated at least 10 times in the Armadillidium nasatum genome. The CENSOR searches we ran in Repbase [69] on the two interspersed repeats that we identified did not reveal any similarity to any known transposable element.",
