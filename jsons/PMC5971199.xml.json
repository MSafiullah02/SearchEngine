In developed countries, noroviruses have been recognized as the most common cause of non-bacterial diarrheal outbreaks in both children and adults, responsible for around 19-21 million illnesses, 56,000-71,000 hospitalizations and 570-800 deaths annually in the US alone [1-4]. Although rotaviruses are regarded as the major cause of childhood diarrhea in developing countries, noroviruses are now fast emerging as the most prevalent etiological agent of severe gastroenteritis in children in countries that have implemented rotavirus vaccines in their immunization programs [4]. A recent review attributed over 200,000 childhood deaths in developing countries to noroviruses [5].",

The VP1 is the major capsid protein and contains antigenically significant epitopes [10]. Ninety dimers of the VP1 constitute the norovirus icosahedral capsid. Structurally, the norovirus VP1 consists of an internal shell (S) domain and the protruding (P) domain. Whilst the S domain tends to be conserved, the P domain is more variable and has been further subdivided into P1 and P2 subdomains [7, 8, 11]. The P2 subdomain is positioned on the external surface of the viral capsid and consists of a hypervariable region that interacts with Histo-Blood Group Antigen (HBGA) receptors on host cells [12-14]. Noroviruses encode only a few copies of the VP2. The VP2 is located at the inner surface of the viral capsid, in association with the VP1 S domain, and is believed to enhance the stability of VP1 [7, 8, 15].",

Noroviruses attach to host cells through the interactions between the VP1 and the host HBGA oligosaccharide receptors [10, 17]. However, recent studies have provided in vivo evidence for HBGA-independent binding and internalization of human norovirus particles, pointing towards the involvement of other or additional host cell surface receptor/s [18]. Although the virus internalization events remain to be clearly elucidated, murine noroviruses have been shown to rely on cholesterol and dynamin in a clathrin- and caveolae-independent pathway [19, 20].",

The outer capsid VP7 and VP4 proteins are antigenically significant, eliciting neutralizing antibodies, and form the basis of the currently licensed rotavirus vaccines [36]. The VP6 constitutes the middle capsid layer, whilst VP2 is the inner core protein. The VP1 is the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. VP3 functions as the capping enzyme for viral RNA.

Briefly, the virus primarily infects the enterocytes of the intestinal villus. Following virus attachment and entry into host cells, which is a multistep process that involves sialic acid receptors and integrins, the virus is localized into endosomes. Within the endosome, the virus loses its outer capsid layer, and the resultant double-layered particles (DLPs) actively transcribe mRNA from viral RNA that are released into the cytoplasm. These mRNAs serve as templates for dsRNA synthesis for progeny virions, or are translated into the structural and nonstructural viral proteins [36]. The initial stages of packaging (early stage DLPs) and replication occur in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies known as viroplasms. Thereafter, DLPs interact with endoplasmic reticular membrane, acquire the outer capsid protein, and progeny virions are eventually released by budding [36].",

RVAs are further classified into G- and P- genotypes on the basis of variations in the antigenically significant outer capsid protein VP7- and VP4- encoding gene, respectively [36]. To date, at least 32 G and 47 P genotypes have been reported [40]. Although multiple G-P genotype combinations have been reported in humans so far, G1-G4, G9 and G12 in conjunction with p [4], p [6], or p [8] are considered as the common human genotypes [28, 35, 38, 40].

Since the capsid binding sites that interact with fucose residues of HBGA receptors are conserved among human noroviruses, several carbohydrate analogs with structures resembling that of fucose are being considered as potential norovirus binding blockers, such as citrate and other glucomimetics [46, 47, 49-52]. For example, in a recent study, two oligosaccharides present in human milk, 2\u2019-fucosyllactose (2\u2019FL) and 3-fucosyllactose (3FL), were shown to block GII.10 norovirus Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) from binding to HBGAs [53]. GII noroviruses have also been found to bind to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and therefore, the role of heparan sulfate analogs, such as heparin and suramin as binding blockers are being explored [54]. Soluble histones, such as histone H1, a heterologous histone molecule, appear to associate with both VLPs and cell surfaces, thereby preventing the binding of viruses to intestinal cells [55]. In a study based on 50 Chinese medicinal herbs, tannic acid was shown to inhibit the interaction between noroviruses and HBGA receptors [56]. The prospects of generating HBGA-blocking monoclonal antibodies that would act in a similar fashion as the hemagglutination inhibiting or neutralizing antibodies of influenza viruses are also being considered [57].",

            "text": "One of the attractive targets for designing anti-norovirus molecules is the virus encoded enzyme, 3CLpro. As mentioned earlier, 3CLpro catalyzes the cleavage of the viral polyprotein into nonstructural proteins during virus replication. The high-resolution structure of 3CLpro with a detailed map of the active site has been obtained [58-61]. The active site of the enzyme contains a catalytic triad which consists of a cysteine (nucleophile) residue, a histidine (general base catalyst) residue, and a glutamic acid that aligns the base and facilitates the deprotonation of the nucleophile [61, 62]. Using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based assays [63] and a cell-based norovirus replicon system [64], it has been possible to identify several 3CLpro inhibiters. These include peptidyl Transition State (TS) inhibitors, latent TS inhibitors and TS mimics [65-71]. The TS inhibitors are competitive inhibitors with an aldehyde, \u03b1-ketoamide, or \u03b1-ketoheterocycle moiety as the war head, and form a reversible-covalent bond with the enzyme [72]. The latent TS inhibitors are bisulfite adducts derived from TS inhibitors that revert back to the aldehyde warhead [70]. On the other hand, the peptidyl TS mimics, such as \u03b1-hydroxyphosphonates and \u03b1-hydroxyesters, bind non-covalently to the enzyme [68, 72]. Peptidyl inhibitors have been shown to suppress replication of murine noroviruses (strain MNV-1) in the small intestine of mice [66].",

Inhibitors of norovirus RdRp include nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogs. The nucleoside inhibitors are phosphorylated to triphosphates by host cell enzymes, following which they exert antiviral effects [75, 76]. Ribavirin (RBV) is a purine analog that was shown to be effective against human and murine noroviruses in cell culture [77]. In a recent study, RBV therapy resulted in complete symptomatic and histological recovery of 3 persistently infected human patients with common variable immunodeficiency [78]. Although RBV is believed to exert antiviral effects through multiple mechanisms, the anti-norovirus activity of RBV is believed to be primarily associated with depletion of GTP levels in host cells [77, 79]. Murine noroviruses were found to exhibit high quasispecies diversity following in vitro exposure to RBV [80].",

Interestingly, statins, a commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drug, were shown to increase the expression of LDLRs, and may be a risk factor in severe cases of norovirus infection [103].",

An additive inhibitory effect on norovirus replication has been observed following the usage of RBV with IFNs in cell-based replicon system [77]. In a recent study, IFN-\u03b3 (type-III) was shown to clear murine noroviruses from a persistently infected mice in absence of adaptive immunity [105]. Synthetic nanogels based on cross-linked Polyethyleneimine (PEI)-Polyethylenglycol (PEG) are being developed for oral delivery of INFs in norovirus infection [106]. Although studies on murine noroviruses have revealed the importance of INFs in host control of viral infection, a recent study provided strong evidence that human noroviruses RNA replication does not induce an IFN response, suggesting a limited role of IFNs in host control of human norovirus replication [107].",

            "text": "Oral Human Immunoglobulin (OHIG) therapy has been shown to be effective in several, but not all chronic shedders of norovirus, and found to be clinically useful in transplant and immunocompromised patients [108-110]. Passive immunization using anti-norovirus antibodies prepared in poultry eggs has also been explored [111, 112]. In one study, chickens immunized with norovirus P particles were found to continuously produce high titers of antibodies in eggs for at least 3 months [111]. The egg yolk antibodies not only blocked binding of norovirus VLPs and P particles to HBGA receptors, but also strongly reacted with norovirus P particles by both ELISA and Western blot. In another study, eggs containing dual antibodies against both rotavirus and norovirus were produced by vaccinating chickens with a divalent vaccine composed of norovirus P particle (as carrier) and rotavirus VP8* protein (as surface insertion) [112]. Since the immunogenicity of egg yolk antibodies, and the associated risk of allergic reactions need to be evaluated before its large-scale application in humans, development of anti-norovirus monoclonal antibodies that are more similar to human IgGs are being considered. Conventional monoclonal antibodies with blockade properties against GII noroviruses have been developed that have potential for humanization [113, 114]. Nanobodies are recombinant, single-domain, camelid heavy-chain antibody fragments that can bind with high affinities to a specific antigen [115]. Recombinant monoclonal llama-derived nanobodies (VHH) have been generated against GI and GII noroviruses, displaying promising results in surrogate neutralizing assays [116]. In a recent study, two nanobodies, Nano-25 and Nano-85, derived from alpaca, were shown to bind to the lower region of the P domain of GII noroviruses [117]. Nano-25 was found to be specific for GII.10, whilst Nano-85 was broadly reactive against several different GII genotypes. Binding of Nano-85 also caused the intact viral particles to disassemble in vitro. Nanobodies are nonimmunogenic when administered orally, and are resistant to protease, which makes them an ideal therapeutic approach for enteric viruses [116]. They can also be engineered into any human immunoglobulin scaffold [116].",

The authors proposed that the antiviral action of AgNPs might be due to interactions with the VP1 of FCVs. In another study, Gold/Copper Sulfide Core/Shell Nanoparticles (Au/CuS core/shell NPs) were found to inactivate norovirus GI.1 VLPs [119]. Evidence for capsid protein degradation and capsid damage were obtained by immunoblotting, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy results. The effects of copper iodide nanoparticles (CuI NPs) on FCV has been studied in Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells [120]. The antiviral effects of CuI Nps was attributed to generation of Cu2+ ions which subsequently caused viral capsid protein oxidation.",

In general, natural phytochemicals and biological substances have been shown to exhibit milder antiviral activities compared to conventional chemical antivirals [121]. However, many of these natural products are safe to consume with minimal, or no side effects, and are a part of the daily diet [121]. Natural compounds with anti-norovirus activity include catechins, flavonoids, anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins, polyphenols and polymeric tannins [121]. Black raspberries, cranberries, grape seeds, green tea extracts, mulberries, persimmons and pomegranates contain flavonoids that exhibit anti-norovirus activity. Grape seeds and green tea are rich in catechins. Polymeric tannins can be found in berries and persimmons. Black berries, cranberries, mulberries and pomegranates contain large amounts of anthocyanidins and polyphenols. Red ginseng contains saponins, also known as ginsenosides, such as Rb1 and Rg1 that have been shown to reduce FCV and murine norovirus titers [122]. Chitosan, a biopolymer derived from chitin, a component of exoskeletons of crustaceans, has been proposed to interact with the norovirus capsid, thereby inhibiting virus attachment and entry [123, 124]. Herbal essential oils, such as oregano oil and its major volatile compound carvacrol have been shown to cause expansion of the capsid of murine noroviruses, resulting in degradation of the viral capsid [125]. Although noroviruses are resistant to low pH, citric acid has been found to cause virus inhibition [46, 121]. In the gut, citrate reacts with water to form a structure similar to fucose, which may act as a competitive inhibitor and prevent noroviruses from binding to HBGA receptors.",

Bismuth Subsalicylate (BSS) is an insoluble salt with antimicrobial properties [130]. Following ingestion, BSS is hydrolyzed in stomach, and the bismuth form insoluble salts including Bismuth Oxychloride (BiOCl) in the gut [130]. BSS and BiOCL have been shown to reduce the infectivity of murine noroviruses, possibly by preventing the attachment of viruses to host cells, and also caused a slight decrease in viral RNA levels [130].",

For long periods, human noroviruses could not be propagated in cell-culture, and no small animal models were available. It was only recently that cell culture systems for studying human norovirus replication in B-cells and stem cell-derived human enteroids, and an immunocompromised mice model for human norovirus infection have been established [41, 133, 134]. Previous studies suggested that protective immunity against noroviruses lasts for short periods of time [135], which questioned the feasibility of developing norovirus vaccines, given the fact that vaccine manufacturing and clinical trials are an expensive process. However, a recent exhaustive epidemiological modeling study provided evidence for long-term immunity, lasting between 4 to 8 years [136]. Human noroviruses are highly genetically and antigenically diverse, with cross-reactivity of <5% between GI and GII genotypes [2, 6, 137]. The plasticity of the norovirus genome has raised concerns on the protection spectrum of human norovirus vaccines against diverse strains [6].",

            "text": "Since the establishment of a tissue-culture system for propagating noroviruses is a recent development, most studies on norovirus vaccines rely on VLPs containing recombinantly expressed VP1 capsid proteins. VLPs are non-replicating particles that lack viral RNA [6]. Because of the VP1 protein(s), VLPs possess strain- and genogroup- specific antigenic determinants of the wild norovirus strains, and have been shown to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in the host [10, 138]. VLPs can be produced in large quantities using different expression systems, such as baculovirus, potato, tomato, tobacco and yeast [139-142]. Viral vectors, such as adenovirus, paramyxovirus (Newcastle disease virus) and vesicular stomatitis virus have also been used to express VLPs [143-145]. This approach seems to be more appealing than VLPs from traditional expression systems, as only a single dose may be required and higher concentration of VLPs is achieved in the host [132]. However, concerns related to biosafety and interference from prior immunity may hinder development of such vectored vaccines [132]. Norovirus VLPs generated using either of the systems possess both S and P domains of VP1, and exhibit the same HBAG binding patterns as the wild virions [132]. Another new strategy has been the expression of P particles containing only the P domain of VP1 [146]. P particles induce similar levels of immune response as VLPs, and can also be used to express other viral antigens, such as rotavirus and hepatitis virus [146].",

Having completed phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials, a bivalent Intramuscular (IM) norovirus vaccine (Takeda Pharmaceutical) is the most advanced VLP-based candidate so far [147-149]. This aluminium hydroxide adjuvant-based vaccine formulation contains GI.1, and the current major norovirus genotype, GII.4. The GI.1 VLP of the vaccine is based on the prototype Norwalk virus strain, whist the GII.4 was based on a consensus sequence from three GII.4 outbreak variants (2006a_Yerseke, 2006b_Den Haag and 2002_Houston) [147]. After oral challenge with a heterovariant GII.4 strain, the bivalent vaccine offered protection against symptomatic illness, which was higher against severe vomiting and diarrhea, but did not significantly reduce the incidence of protocol-defined illness [138, 147, 148]. Prior to the bivalent vaccine, Takeda (LigoCyte) also had developed an intranasal monovalent vaccine with a GI.1 component that is identical to GI of the bivalent vaccine [147, 150]. Following challenge, the intranasal vaccine was shown to induce moderate levels of protection in human volunteers [151]. A limitation of these vaccine clinical trials was that they did not recruit elderly adults and children, age groups in which vaccine outcomes may be different.",

None of the sialylmimetics demonstrated any significant inhibition of the rhesus rotavirus strain (strain RRV), whilst modest levels of inhibition were observed against human RVA strain Wa.

Cell surface PDIs appeared to generate thiol groups in rotavirus VP5* and/or VP6 proteins, which either primed the proteins to interact with other cell surface receptors, or contributed to virus disassembly [167]. The redox activity of PDI can be inhibited by membrane-impermeant thiol/disulfide-blockers, such as DTNB [5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)] and bacitracin [168]. It has been shown that treatment of MA104 cells with DTNB and bacitracin resulted in decreased rotavirus infectivity, whilst post-entry treatment of cells with these inhibitors did not influence virus infectivity [168].",

Phosphonoformic acid (foscarnet, PFA), a non-nucleoside pyrophosphate analogue inhibitor of viral polymerases, was demonstrated to inhibit both plus- and minus-strand RNA synthesis in a dose dependent manner [182]. In another study, a series of nucleoside analogs were demonstrated to inhibit synthesis of either plus strand or minus strand rotavirus RNA [183]. Interestingly, Neomycin and other aminoglycosides have also been shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on rotavirus plus- and minus-strand RNA synthesis [184].

In a subsequent study, the effects of RBV and three other antiviral agents (3-deazaguanine [3-DG], 3-deazauridine, and 9-(S)-(2,3-dihydroxy- propyl)adenine [(S)-DHPA]) were evaluated against simian RVA strain SA-11 in tissue culture, and murine RVAs in mice inoculation studies [187]. None of the agents were found to inhibit RdRp activity of SA11, although evidence for inhibition of viral polypeptide synthesis was obtained for RBV and 3-DG.

In a recent placebo-controlled trial, ARP1 was shown to significantly reduce stool output in severe cases of infantile rotaviral diarrhea [199]. Although the mechanism of action of ARP1 is not clear, it may involve binding to VP6 that might result in conformational changes in the outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7, thereby preventing virus entry, and virus neutralization by immune exclusion [197-199]. The advantages of passive immunotherapy using transgenic rice expressing a water soluble, heat resistant rotavirus-specific llama heavy-chain antibody fragment (termed MucoRice-ARP1) are also being evaluated [200]. To benefit from the synergistic effects of VHH and probiotics, probiotics, such as Lactobacillus paracasei and yeast, expressing anti-RVA VHHs (ARP-1 in secreted and anchored forms, or anchored ARP1/ARP-3) have been constructed [198, 201, 202]. In another recent study, two other VHHs, designated as 3B2 and 2KD1, that are specific for the inner capsid protein VP6 of RVAs, were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect larvae [203]. Neutralizing antibodies against rotavirus have also been produced in vegetables, such as transgenic purple tomatoes [204].",

In a recent study, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was shown to modulate the innate signaling pathway and cytokine responses to rotavirus vaccine in neonatal human gut microbiota transplanted pigs [210]. Soluble factors released by Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 were found to block rotavirus infection of cultured human mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cells [211]. In rotavirus infected rodent models, probiotics, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 and Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 have been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhea as well as severity of intestinal lesions [212]. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) investigating the therapeutic effects of human probiotic Lactobacillus strains on childhood rotavirus diarrhea have been summarized in an excellent review by Li\u00e9vin-Le Moal and Servin (2014) [212]. Another study performed a meta-analysis study on efficacy of probiotics in children with rotavirus diarrhea, concluding that probiotics have a positive significant effect in reduction of rotavirus diarrhea [213].",

In a Brazilian study, 4 species of medicinal plants were found to exhibit in vitro activity against rotaviruses [214]. In another in vitro study, fractions obtained from Achyrocline bogotensis were shown to exert a virucidal effect on rotaviruses and astroviruses, resulting in reduction of infectious viral particles [215]. Nutritional extracts of plants, such as Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn, Aspalathus linearis (Burm.f.) R. Dahlgren, Urtica dioica L., Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Olea europaea L. have also been demonstrated to possess anti-rotaviral activity [216]. A combination of Sophora Flavescens Extract (SFE) and Stevioside (SV) from Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni has been shown to alleviate diarrhea, decrease viral shedding in feces, and reduce severity of intestinal lesions in piglets [217]. Persimmon extracts, which are rich in tannins, were found to exhibit antiviral activities against rotaviruses, possibly by aggregating viral proteins [218]. Saponin extracts from Quillaja saponaria Molina have been proposed to cause disruption of virus receptors on cell membranes, thereby inhibiting attachment of rotavirus to host cells [219]. Pectic polysaccharides, derived from Panax ginseng, have also been found to inhibit rotavirus attachment to host cells [220]. Commercially available cranberry fruit juice drink has been demonstrated to inhibit rotavirus replication in MA-104 cells [221]. Extracts from Glycyrrhiza uralensis were found to alleviate rotaviral diarrhea and decrease small intestinal lesions in piglets, possibly by exerting antiviral as well as anti-inflammatory effects [222]. The anti-rotaviral activity of 60 different flavones and flavonols have been studied against human rotavirus strain Wa in vitro [223]. Krisanaklan, a herbal extract used in Thailand, was found to exert antidiarrheal effects by inhibiting the luminal cAMP-dependent chloride channel and Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels in enterocytes of neonatal mice infected with rotaviruses [224]. Another herbal remedy, the Qiwei Baizhu powder, was demonstrated to alleviate rotavirus diarrhea and improve small intestinal absorption in neonatal mice [225].",

The foundation of this vaccine is based on the observation that G1 and P1a [8] are the most common human RVA VP7- and VP4- genotypes/antigens worldwide [28]. Based on results of phase-III clinical trials involving over 77,000 infants in Asia, Europe and the Americas, RotarixTM was found to exhibit high efficacies (81%-96%, combined 2 year follow-up) against severe rotavirus diarrhea, and posed a reduced risk of intussusception, an issue that lead to the withdrawal of a previous RVA vaccine [236]. Following a 2-dose schedule (oral doses at 6 and 10 weeks of age), efficacy rates of 83%-85%, 81%-82%, and 75%-78%, respectively, have been observed with RotarixTM against hospitalizations with diarrhea, wild-type G1 strains, and non-G1 serotypes/strains [237]. However, when compared to the high efficacies observed in developed countries, RotarixTM was found to exhibit lower vaccine efficiency against severe RVA diarrhea in developing countries [234]. To date, Rotarix has been licensed in more than 100 countries worldwide, and is a part of national immunization programs in many of these countries [28]. The presentation of the vaccine has also undergone modifications, with the development of a liquid formulation in addition to the original lyophilized version [236].",

Results obtained from 3-dose clinical trials found the naturally attenuated RV3 vaccine to be safe and well tolerated [247, 248]. However, only partial protection (vaccine efficacy of 54%) against rotavirus disease was obtained [248]. Subsequently, a high titer RV3 vaccine, known as RV3-BB [Bishop-Barnes] vaccine was developed [249]. In a recent double-blind, three-arm, placebo-controlled safety and immunogenicity trial based on 3 doses of vaccine in a neonatal or infant schedule, RV3-BB was shown to be immunogenic and well tolerated [250].",

Each of these reassortant vaccine strains expresses one of the major human VP7 (G1-G4), or VP4 (P1a [8]) antigens on a bovine RVA (strain WC3) genetic backbone. In addition, the vaccine also contains bovine VP7-G6 and VP4-P7[5] antigens. RotaTeqTM confers both homotypic and heterotypic immunity [252]. In the REST (Rotavirus Efficacy and Safety Trial) study involving several countries and a large study population, RotaTeqTM exhibited vaccine efficacy of 98% against severe G1-G4 rotavirus gastroenteritis, whilst efficacy of 74% was observed against G1-G4 rotavirus gastroenteritis of any severity [253]. These efficacy results were corroborated by subsequent clinical trials conducted in European countries and Japan [254, 255]. On the other hand, low vaccine efficacies (39.3% and 48.3%, respectively) have been observed against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in some developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Kenya, and Mali) and Asia (Bangladesh and Vietnam) [256, 257]. RotaTeqTM has been approved for use in more than 100 countries [28]. Although post-licensure studies revealed approximately 1.5 cases of intussusceptions per 100,000 recipients of the 1st dose of the vaccine, there was no evidence for increased risk levels of intussusception in the vaccine group when compared to the placebo group [258, 259]. Rare cases of Kawasaki disease has also been reported in infants who received the 1st dose of vaccine [260]. However, no association was found between RotaTeqTM and increased risk of intussusception, or Kawasaki disease [261].",

A new 5-valent human-bovine (UK) reassortant vaccine that contains G9 in addition to G1-G4 was shown to be safe and immunogenic in a small sample of adult volunteers [267]. Another pentavalent bovine (UK)-human reassortant vaccine candidate containing the major human G1-G4 and G9 antigens has been developed by the Serum Institute, India in collaboration with NIAID [268]. The Indian vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic in phase I and II studies.",

Bovine strains RIT 4237 and Wistar Calf 3 (WC3), and reassortant rhesus rotavirus vaccine strain MMU18006 have been studied as human rotavirus vaccine candidates, with inconsistent and disappointing results [269-271]. In China, a lamb rotavirus strain derived vaccine, known as the Lanzhou lamb rotavirus (LLR) vaccine, has been approved for use in children [272]. The efficacies of one dose of the LLR vaccine against rotavirus infection ranged from 44.3%-51.8% in children aged between 9-35 months [272]. A more recent study reported an overall protection of 35% against all forms of RVA diarrhea, with 52% protection against moderate diarrhea caused by G3 strains [273]. Although the efficacy of the LLR vaccine remains to be properly evaluated using a randomized, placebo-controlled phase-III trial and this vaccine is not included in the national immunization program of China, around 30,000,000 doses of the LLR vaccine has been administered between 2000 and 2012 [274].",
