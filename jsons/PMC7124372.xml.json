IHR (2005) represents a consensus among all WHO Member States to cooperate for global health security. It shifts the focus from quarantine and embargoes at borders to containment at source, increases the emphasis on preparedness by requiring all countries to maintain necessary core capacities in surveillance and response, and widens the scope from reporting of a predefined disease list to reporting of a public health event based on a decision tree analysis.",

By declaring a PHEIC, the Director-General requires state parties to share critical information for risk assessment, adjust response plans if deemed necessary, and implement temporary recommendations formulated by the emergency committee. As the Acting Chair of the emergency committee for Ebola stated on June 14, 2019,1 the declaration of a PHEIC for the current Ebola outbreak would add no clear benefit in any of these three areas. Both DR Congo and Uganda are providing information in a timely manner, and 10 months into the outbreak (with innumerable daily border crossings of inhabitants in the area), the recent event in Uganda is confined to close family members. Members of the emergency committee cited potential disadvantages of a PHEIC declaration (effects on travel and trade that could impede support to affected regions and hinder outbreak control) and provided technical advice that the STAG-IH supports fully.",

As international public health emergencies evolve into more complex forms, it becomes necessary to identify gaps in the alarm and response mechanisms, and the WHA has called for two reviews of IHR (2005): one in 2010, after the H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, and a second in 2015, to examine the response to the west Africa Ebola virus outbreak. Citing the difficulties and potential risks in opening an accepted international agreement to revision, Member States requested a mechanism to independently monitor WHO's ongoing risk assessment. STAG-IH has its origin in this request, and has since its first meeting in 2018 reviewed WHO's risk assessments and responses before and between the emergency committee's three meetings about the current Ebola virus outbreak.",
