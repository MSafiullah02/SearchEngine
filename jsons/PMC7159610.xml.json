Once coagulation and flocculation have been completed, these pathogens would likely be associated with floc particles having significantly different sizes and shapes from those shown in the table. It is the characteristics of these floc particles that have a direct influence on pathogen removal through sedimentation and granular media filtration. Nevertheless, the pathogen characteristics listed in Table 1 play a role in determining the physical and chemical characteristics of the floc particles. Floc characteristics will also depend on other factors including the type and dosage of coagulant being used, the pH of coagulation, and the characteristics of other particles such as suspended silts and clays.",

Previous research has concluded that particles in the size range of 3 to 7 \u03bcm were associated with early breakthrough, but that research did not evaluate particles smaller than 1 \u03bcm in size (Moran et al, 1993). It is also possible that surface charge played a role, because measurements showed that A. hydrophila was less negatively charged than either E. coli O157:H7 or E. intestinalis (Harrington et al, 2001).

It is important to stress that pathogen samples were collected from ripened dual\u2010media filters.

Additional studies are needed to quantify the effects of filtration rate and filter type on pathogen breakthrough.",

The Oak Creek (Wis.) Water and Sewer Utility contributed garnet sand, silica sand, and crushed anthracite for trimedia filtration studies. Installation and startup of the pilot\u2010plant facilities were achieved with the substantial involvement of Jim Buchholtz, Chris Bone, and Andrew Harris. Andrew Harris and Kristine Hahn provided assistance with the pilot\u2010scale experiments. David A. Battigelli provided laboratory support and consultation throughout the project; Brad Argue, Rebecca Hoffman, Elizabeth Weisshaar, and David Polchert provided additional laboratory support. Secretarial support was provided by Nanette Kelsey in the University of Wisconsin's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The authors also thank Kathryn Martin, AWWA Research Foundation project manager, and the project advisory committee\u2014Gene Koontz, Rick Sakaji, and Stanley States\u2014for their support and suggestions throughout the project.",
