However, in order for crewmembers to perform efficiently in the suit, the pressure should be as low as possible, yet still maintain adequate oxygen tension to avoid hypoxia. Whenever the body undergoes transition to lower pressure environment, there is always a risk of developing decompression sickness (DCS) or illness, also known as \"the bends\". The larger the pressure difference in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere, the higher the risk of DCS developing, unless adequate time is dedicated to prebreathing 100% oxygen to wash out the nitrogen from the body. The risk of DCS may be lower in microgravity than in 1-g conditions, possibly due to changes in large muscle group shear forces or differences in bubble dynamics. At least the number of observed cases of orbital DCS is less than would be expected based on terrestrial models (Balldin and Webb 2002 , Pilmanis et al. 2004 , Webb et al. 2005 ).",

Design engineers must trade the use of toxic compounds with a performance track record versus less toxic compounds with potential performance issues, especially in the area of propellants, cooling system, and in-situ resource utilization hardware. For example, fuels for reaction control jets often employ hypergolic components that spontaneously react or burn when mixed together and are effective in the vacuum of space, such as monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, both of which are highly toxic when inhaled or when contact is made with the mucous membranes. Another example is in the cooling loops where ammonia or ethylene glycol is often effectively used; however, both of these substances have leaked into space station compartments and both have serious effects when breathed or ingested in significant quantities.",

Artificial gravity, intermittent or continuous, could play a role in maintaining immune function, if it is determined that diminished gravity exposure produces alterations in leukocyte gene expression (see Chapter 10, Section 1).",

This is especially true for protection against the high dose concentrated over a short time interval, which could result from a large and energetic solar particule event (SPE) (Figure 11 -02, left). The solar protons are much more amenable to shielding than is galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) (Figure 11 -02, right). Having transit vehicle or habitat shielding that can provide a \"storm shelter\" in the event of a major SPE, will be an essential design feature (Wilson 1997 , Simonsen 1997 . Shielding GCR may come in the form of planetary regolith or natural terrain features, which additionally may aid with micrometeroid protection. The development of radioprotectant formulations, or agents that may reduce oxidative damage, which could be administered orally or parenterally, may augment the crew's defense against some of the ionizing radiation (Stanford and Jones 1999 , Lupton 2001 , Taylor 1992 . Recent studies suggest that microgravity may affect cellular gene expression, and thus may alter the cell's natural radiation defense and repair systems (Boonyaratanakornkit et al. 2005, Purevdorj-Gage and Hyman 2006) . This would most likely be a negative way synergy, such that the combination of ionizing radiation and microgravity may produce more biologic impact than ionizing radiation alone. If the observations in these studies prove to be correct, then artificial gravity may play a role in reducing these biological effects, by suppressing the changes in gene expression.",

Without the natural dark-induced timing of melatonin release of the environment, the vehicle may need to provide dark quarters to allow normal sleep patterns to be acquired by long duration crewmembers. In addition, vehicle docking, relocation and timing for orbital maneuvers, often force crewmembers to be awake during their chronobiologic nadirs, increasing the risk of fatigue-induced crewmember errors. Flight rules have been written in attempt to reduce the risk of fatigue-related task errors, but these rules are often overcome by operational drivers. Supplemental melatonin as well as short-acting benzodiazopines have been used during both Shuttle and ISS flights to not only induce sleep but to re-establish shifted sleep entrainment.

Countermeasures for the muscle, bone, and neurovestibular changes are prescribed by the flight surgeons during both short-and long-duration spaceflight, and may include modalities such as exercise (aerobic for cardiovascular protection, resistive for musculo-skeletal protection), lower body negative pressure, fluid loading, anti-g suit, and pressure garment (for orthostatic hypotension protection). This is where artificial gravity may provide the largest impact to protecting functionality for the crew upon return to a gravity field after prolonged periods in microgravity. Artificial gravity may be particularly effective in preserving the capability to response to an off-nominal landing event whether it be during the landing phase, or the need for emergency response or egress of the vehicle after landing.

The gradient necessary to induce syncope on a short-radius centrifuge varies according to individual tolerances, the specific centrifuge configuration, and the onset rate. One study with supine subjects on a short-radius centrifuge revealed that cardiovascular responses to the gravity gradient becomes significant when gravity level at the feet (Gz) is about 1.5 g (Hastreiter and Young 1997) . In this study, subjects had the tops of their heads at the center of rotation and the authors reported that syncope occurred in some subjects when as little as 2 g was applied to the feet.

G-LOC is an important issue in high performance and military aviation and has been extensively investigated in high performance centrifuges. The mechanism of G-LOC is thought to be primarily due to a sudden hydrostatic pressure drop associated with rapid onset high-Gz acceleration, because venous pooling is limited by the use of anti-g garments (Self et al. 1996) . In short-radius centrifuge, the onset acceleration does not exceed a fraction of g/s. Despite differences in mechanism and the usual rate of onset, the resulting decrease in cerebral blood flow causes essentially the same neurologic symptoms in both cases.

(1995) showed an increase in mean arterial blood pressure that paralleled the increase in gravity level during onset and rose from about 70 mmHg to 90 mmHg with the application of 2.2 g along Gz. Another study reported very small decreases in systolic blood pressure along with slight increases in diastolic blood pressure (Vil-Viliams et al. 2004) . A third study showed a statistically significant but small decrease in pulse pressure that was primarily attributable to increased diastolic blood pressure with the application of Gz acceleration (Hastreieter and Young 1997) . For medical monitoring purposes, it is probably sufficient to check that the measured blood pressure remains fairly stable after the centrifuge reaches a constant speed. Formal termination criteria generally include a lower limit on systolic blood pressure (e.g., 70 mmHg) and may add a combination of other conditions to define hypotension (e.g., systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg and tachycardia as greater than 140 beats/min, or a fall of systolic blood pressure by 25 mmHg). In general, it is difficult to detect a sudden fall in blood pressure with intermittent measurements before presyncopal symptoms are apparent. Continuous blood pressure monitoring may be somewhat more helpful, provided the measurement device is sufficiently reliable.",

Other possible symptoms may include salivation, headache, eructation, warmth, flatulence, and anorexia. The traditional theory explaining the mechanism of motion sickness is that it results from a conflict in sensory inputs. The relevant issue here is the fact that in an artificial gravity environment Coriolis forces act on the endolymph in the vestibular system when the semicircular canals are moved into or out of the plane of motion. This creates illusory tilt sensations and nystagmus that can then trigger motion sickness (See Chapter 4, Section 3). Pitch head movements are apparently more provocative of symptoms than yaw movements (Young et al. 2001) . Transient heart rate increases have been noted to occur after head movements , Young et al. 2001 .",

A subjective numerical assessment scale is often useful in gauging the severity of symptoms. Progressive or severe symptoms require test termination.

Lead systems that use two mutually perpendicular leads, such as biaxillary leads and a sternal lead or a modified chest lead configuration, have proven to be adequate for monitoring purposes. Although it was not a requirement early on in the history of centrifuge training, electrocardiographic monitoring of subjects in high performance centrifuges has become standard because the publication of a study that documented the high frequency of arrhythmias in normal subjects exposed to standard Air Force training profiles (Whinnery 1990 ). Subsequent studies have confirmed that high-g-induced dysrhythmias are very common, with more than 90% of fighter aircrew exhibiting some sort of rhythm disturbance during high-g training profiles. Sinus arrhythmia, defined as a rate variation corresponding to more than 25 beats/min between successive beats, is the most common dysrhythmia and occurs in approximately 50-80% of aircrew at some time during standard high-g centrifuge training. Isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are the second most common arrhythmia, occurring about 60% of the time. Other arrhythmias, such as premature atrial contractions (PACs), sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial rhythms, junctional rhythms, bigeminy, trigeminy, and Adissociation are also commonly seen (DeHart and Davis 2002 , Hanada et al. 2004 .",

            "text": "Most arrhythmias occur during simulated air combat maneuvers or rapid onset +Gz exposure. Because the profile usually used in artificial gravity studies are much less severe and do not involve anti-g straining maneuvers, the overall frequency of arrhythmias is much less. However, it is still important to distinguish benign arrhythmias from those that may either indicate underlying cardiac disease or increase the risk for such dangerous rhythms as prolonged sinus arrest, A-V dissociation, ventricular fibrillation, or sustained ventricular tachycardia. A recent article by Hanada et al. (2004) analyzed data from the centrifuge training records of 195 male fighter pilots that was accumulated during a two-year period by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force Aeromedical Laboratory. Using their accumulated clinical experience and other considerations, such as a modified version of the Lown criteria to rank the clinical risk associated with ventricular ectopy, this group proposed some criteria for suspending high-g training on the basis of arrhythmias. They grouped the arrhythmias into three broad categories, as shown in Table 11-03. This approach is similar to that used in many protocols for artificial gravity studies (see, for example, Iwasaki et al. 1998 ). In terminating a centrifuge run, the medical monitor should determine the rate of deceleration appropriate for the specific arrhythmia. Many of the critical arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, may require basic or advanced cardiac life support interventions. In those cases, a rapid deceleration to avoid delay in treating the subject is appropriate. A rapid deceleration may also be helpful in breaking the re-entry circuit of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) (Zawadzka-Bartczak and Kopka 2004), but will likely exacerbate sinus bradycardia. It is useful to set predetermined termination criteria for some of the borderline findings, such as defining more than 30 PVCs per hour or more than 6 PVCs in a single minute as frequent, for the purposes of a study. Other termination criteria based on EKG findings should include ST elevations or depressions and PVCs that fall on the T-wave of the previous beat (R on T). A maximum limit on tachycardia (e.g., greater than 180 beats/min) should also be set. It should be noted that T-wave changes, including flattening, inversion, and the appearance of biphasic T-waves are often seen at the beginning of high-g runs and generally disappear later in the run (DeHart and Davis 2002) . These are generally not considered to be termination criteria for high-g centrifugation. This phenomenon has not been reported in artificial gravity studies and it is unclear if this should be considered a benign finding in that setting.",
