            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive economic shock across the world due to business interruptions and shutdowns from social-distancing measures. To evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period, when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level. The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance (UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9% in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero, and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a first step in quantifying the householdlevel impacts of COVID-19 at a regional scale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect macroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households' decision-making and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural disasters).",

In addition, the household model has also been applied to estimate household-level resilience to natural disasters in Fiji, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka [Walsh and Hallegatte, 2018 . Here the economic shock of COVID-19 is represented by loss of income, in certain industry sectors, during a pre-defined crisis period. The impact of the coronavirus on household consumption, savings and recovery time is analyzed, as well as changes poverty rates and geospatial inequality distributions, with different assumptions regarding the social protection system. Since California has been affected early and high-frequency data on the situation of households are available in the U.S., the Bay Area is a good case study to develop and validate the model, which we then plan to apply in other countries and regions.",

The poverty rates for cases A, B and C are computed based on consumption levels at the end of the crisis, and represent temporary poverty rates, as compared to annual poverty rates as is traditionally reported. For case C, uncertainty in implementation is accounted for using a median exclusion rate of 40% in addition to worst-case and best-case scenarios of 55% and 10%. Under case A, the deep poverty and poverty rates temporarily increase dramatically from 1.7% to 9.5% and 17.1% to 25.9% respectively, from pre-crisis to post-crisis levels. With no social protection, the Bay Area could have an additional 643,000 people in poverty. Cases B, and C reduce the increase in poverty rates by providing income and benefits to impoverished individuals. Under case C, with an assumed 40% exclusion rate, the deep poverty rate drops from 9.5% assuming no social benefits, to 4.9% with CARES. The poverty rate would still increase by 2.0% points even with the implementation of state and federal assistance. Given the uncertainty around the duration of the crisis period, the effect of the different policies are evaluated for different crisis periods: T C = 2, 3, 6 and 9 months. Figure 6 illustrates the percent of the Bay Area population under each lower income level for all three policies evaluated using the four different crisis periods. Cases B and C reduce the number of individuals for each lower income levels.

In comparison, the addition of unemployment insurance and individual benefits from the CARES Act lead to a lower average consumption loss across all counties in the Bay Area, assuming a 40% exclusion rate for case C.

Additionally, the role of uncertainty in households decisionmaking could change the rate of savings depletion and the severity of the impact of the crisis. Households do not have perfect information about the duration nor depth of the crisis. Finally, the impact of simultaneous exogenous shocks, such as natural disasters, is of great concern, since lower income populations will have depleted most of their savings and are vulnerable to another shock. For instance, Puerto Rico experienced a 5.4 magnitude earthquake on May 2 during the lockdown with several buildings damaged.
