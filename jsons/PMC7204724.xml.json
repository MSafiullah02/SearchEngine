In particular, the fact that certain enzymes that contain selenium can feature antioxidant properties. Several reports highlight their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antiviral activities [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. Notably, some organoselenium compounds display the mimetic activity of these enzymes, making them attractive synthetic targets [7,8]. Considering the current pandemic of corona virus (COVID-19), a very interesting study just appeared in the literature where an organoselenium compound (Ebselen) presented the strongest antiviral effect at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM treatment in COVID-19 virus infected Vero cells [9]. Therefore, the construction of the C\u2013S/Se bond seems to be a very important target in organic synthesis and has attracted considerable attention in the last years [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]].",

The oxadiazole core is well established as a \u201cprivileged scaffolds\u201d and is widely used for pharmaceutical purposes [17]. ODZs are bioisosteres which increase pharmaceutical activity. A wide range of biological activity is associated with ODZs, including, analgesic, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, angiogenesis inhibition, anticonvulsant and immune-stimulatory [18,19]. This moiety is present in several commercially available drugs, I-IV (Fig. 1\n) [20,21], highlighting the importance of this nucleus. Additionally, ODZ derivatives are useful in material sciences (e.g. V, Fig. 1) as well as in the organic synthesis [[22], [23], [24]].",

            "text": "Analysis of the data listed in Table 1 leads to the conclusion that the IP and EA energies depend directly on the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing characteristics of the substituent group. The introduction of electron donor groups increases the electron density and therefore decreases the oxidation potential and the IP [57,61], 3g with the dimethylamino substituent in the phenyl portion directly linked to the selenium atom, showed this effect more pronouncedly. This effect was also observed on molecules 3b, 3c and 3d, in which oxidation starts at less anodic values, however the electron donor substituent is linked to the phenyl portion closest to oxadiazole. For compounds 3a and 3f, with even less donating substituents, this same behavior was also observed. The insertion of a nitro group, due to its electron-withdrawing effect, caused an increase in the oxidation potential of compound 6e. A similar effect was observed for compound 6h [61]. The increase in electron density caused by the introduction of electron donor groups decreases the reduction potential and the EA. The data suggest that this substitution alters the LUMO energy level, i.e., the energetic state of the electrons inserted during the reduction process, leading to a change in the reduction potential. Observing the reduction potentials of the studied molecules indicates that the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups into selenylated-oxadiazoles derivatives can increase their redox potential due to the decrease in the LUMO level [61]. These values are in agreement with those obtained in the theoretical modeling below, where the influence of the substituent groups in the frontier orbitals was confirmed.",

Furthermore, for compounds 3c, 3e and 3g are possible to observe a weak band around to 330 nm, which should be associated with an n\u2192\u03c0* due to the presence of the nonbonding electron pairs over these molecules.

The HOMO for compounds 3b, 3d and 3g containing electron donor groups is centered over these groups and the closest phenyl ring, while for compounds 3a, 3c, 3f, and 3e where the donating power decreases, the HOMO is mostly a \u03c0 orbital spread throughout the phenyl and oxadiazole moieties with the contribution of a non-bonding pair in the selenium atom.

For compounds 3b and, 3d also with the higher donating power substituents, but now in the phenyl moiety closest to the oxadiazole, the intense transition that generates the emission of these compounds is assigned as HOMO\u2192LUMO transition.

On the other hand, for 3e and 3h with the most electron-withdrawing substituents, the first intense transition also has its origin in a HOMO\u2192LUMO configuration, with a higher transition dipole for 3e and a lower one to 3h, demonstrating that the substituents can have a significant impact on the configuration of the transition with larger amplitude, which ultimately influences the emission.

All the selenylated products were thermally stable, presenting initial decomposition only in temperatures above 260 \u00b0C. The photophysical investigation revealed that all compounds displayed absorption in the UV region (270\u2013329 nm), which are attributed to combined n\u2192\u03c0* and \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transitions.

Theoretical methods were used to obtain their ground state geometry and TD-DFT results demonstrated an influence of the substituent groups in transition dipole moment associated with the first excited state, which seems to impact directly in the quantum yield of these compounds. Electrochemical studies revealed that the magnitude of oxidation potentials (0.69\u20131.57 V vs. NHE) and reduction potentials (\u22121.61 to \u22122.18 V vs. NHE) and also the IP energies (\u22125.13 to \u22126.01 eV) and EA energies (\u22122.25 to \u22122.83 eV) depend directly on electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effects of the substituents in agreement with the calculated frontier orbitals.
