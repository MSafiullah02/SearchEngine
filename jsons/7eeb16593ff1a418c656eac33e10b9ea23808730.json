Pulmonary function affects the oxygen supply to the brain. Low pulmonary function 27 and pulmonary disease, in turn, are associated with exposure to multiple insults across the full 28 life course -notably smoking, illness, and socioeconomic deprivation, stunting -suggesting that 29 they may capture a number of dementia risk factors.(6, 7) As the number of studies on 30 pulmonary function and dementia increases, we provide the first aggregation of these results by 31 conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence from longitudinal studies to 32 examine the hypothesis that low pulmonary function and pulmonary disease are risk factors for 33 later dementia. 34 35 METHODS 36 In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines,(8) we searched PubMed for articles reporting 37 longitudinal (cohort) studies linking pulmonary function or respiratory illness with dementia 38 occurrence from the inception of the database (1951) until 1 st April 2019.

The presence of a respiratory illness was associated with a similar 161 magnitude of increased risk. 162 163 The effect size we found is comparable to other accepted risk factors for dementia as reported in 164 comprehensive meta-analyses in the World Alzheimer Report 2014(31) (Figure 3) where lower 165 educational attainment, for example, was found to be associated with an 1.8-fold increased risk 166 of incident dementia (effect estimate combining adjusted odds ratios and HRs, 95% CI 1.83, 167 1.63-2.05; 31 studies). Pooling 31 studies revealed that depression was associated with around a 168 doubling in the risk of incident dementia (unadjusted effect estimate, 1.97, 95% CI 1.67-2.02) 169 relative to people who were free of this psychological disorder, and having diabetes in late life 170 was associated with a 1.5-fold increase in the risk of developing dementia of any type (1.50, 1.33-171 1.70) and a doubling of risk of developing vascular dementia (2.39, 1.92-2.98). The recent Lancet 172 commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care similarly reported approximately 1.5-173 fold increased relative risk of dementia for individuals with midlife obesity, hypertension or later 174 life smoking (Figure 3).(32) 175 176 We note a recent systematic review of four longitudinal studies on the association between 177 pulmonary function and cognitive performance.(33) While critical of the methodological quality 178 of the studies they included, the investigators found a cross-sectional association between poorer 179 lung function and lower levels of cognitive function, but little evidence for a longitudinal 180 association. This may reflect different mechanisms of cognitive performance and neurological 181 pathology underlying dementia as seems to be the case with other risk factors, such as vitamin D 182 levels.(34, 35) 183 184 Limitations and strengths 185 The comprehensive search strategy used is likely to have identified practically all relevant 186 published studies and the inclusion of only longitudinal studies strengthens the robustness of our 187 conclusions since, while such studies still only describe associations and do not permit causal 188 inferences to be drawn, the temporal association between exposure and outcome adds weight to 189 the potential importance of any identified association. The pooling of results, where possible, in 190 random effects meta-analyses provides a quantitative summary of the evidence being a more 191 precise estimate and overview of the literature than narrating the results of the individual studies. 192 193 There are several limitations to our work. The substantial statistical heterogeneity between 194 studies is matched by methodological heterogeneity and -importantly -variation in the specific 195 measure of pulmonary function used. This limited the number of studies which could be pooled 196 in meta-analyses which may have biased our results, though the direction of bias is unlikely to be 197 consistent in all the excluded studies. 198 199The methodology used for dementia ascertainment is a potentially important limitation for 200",

            "text": "208 cohort, of all the patients with diagnosed dementia who died during the follow-up, death 209 certification correctly identified the diagnosis in as large a proportion as 70% of deceased 210 patients.(38) Furthermore, investigators studying BMI and dementia found their results were 211 similar whether dementia was ascertained solely from mortality data or whether other methods 212 were also used.(39) 213 214Plausible mechanisms 215A number of lines of research, in combination with the disappointing results from preventive 216 interventions of dementia implemented at older ages,(40,41) provide circumstantial support for 217 aetiological process acting from across the life course.(42)(43)(44)(45)(46) First, recent diagnostic criteria for 218Alzheimer disease acknowledge a long induction period for dementia such that an asymptomatic 219 'preclinical' phase is now part of the classification.(47) Second, this accords with findings from 220 pathological and epidemiological studies suggesting that dementia has its origins earlier in life 221 than previously thought. For example, autopsy studies of individuals of all ages demonstrate that 222Alzheimer-type pathology begins to develop decades before the clinical onset of symptoms.(48-  223 50) Third, among persons without dementia, measurements of the Alzheimer biomarker, 224 cerebral amyloid pathology suggest a 20-to 30-year interval between first development of 225 amyloid positivity and onset of clinial dementia.(51) Fourth, there is some evidence from 226 prospective cohort studies that cardiovascular disease risk factors measured in midlife are 227 associated with later dementia risk.(10, 30, 52-54) For example, in a recent analysis of the 228 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, midlife hypertension and elevated midlife 229 systolic blood pressure predicted accelerated cognitive decline during 20 years of follow-up.(55) 230 That cardiovascular disease risk factors 'track' from early life into adulthood(56, 57) -for 231 example, there is a correlation between blood pressure measured in childhood and again later 232 life(58) -is consistent with the long-term influence of exposures occurring in childhood. Fifth, a 233 recent observational study linked early life cardiorespiratory fitness with later young-onset 234 dementia,(59) though a similar association was not observed between cardiovascular disease risk 235 factors and late-onset dementia mortality elsewhere.(60) 236 237 There are at least three plausible mechanisms for the observed association: (i) hypoxic damage to 238 the brain resulting from poorer pulmonary function; (ii) pulmonary function may serve as a 239 proxy for other exposures earlier in the life course which increase dementia risk; and (iii) the 240 association may result from the shared aetiology between pulmonary, cardiovascular disease and 241 dementia. These mechanisms will now be considered in turn. 242 243 First, the hypoxia theory proposes that poor pulmonary function is not only a risk marker but 244 also a possible risk factor for dementia through its effects on the brain's oxygen supply. Indeed, 245 most dementia cases in old age are with mixed pathologies including both vascular and neuronal 246 damage. For example, the hippocampus -an area of the brain selectively affected in Alzheimer's 247 disease -is particularly vulnerable to ischaemic damage,(61) although animal models of chronic 248 hypoperfusion demonstrate impairment of spatial working memory and slowly evolving white 249 matter abnormalities but no neuropathological changes in the hippocampus.(62) Future analyses 250 of magnetic resonance imaging in large prospective cohort studies, such as UK Biobank(63) or 251 the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (EPAD) Longitudinal Cohort Study(64) could 252 help interrogate more closely the putative influence of hypoxia on the hippocampus and other 253 areas of the brain. 254 255 Second, similarly to physical stature with which it is correlated, lung function may reflect life 256 course exposures which modify an individual's risk of dementia.(6, 44, 65, 66) As alluded to 257 above, the life course paradigm in epidemiology hypothesises that exposures at different points 258 in the life course could influence the risk of developing dementia, either through an 259 accumulation of risk or through exposure at critical/sensitive periods.(44-46) Researchers from 260 the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility study in Reykjavik, Iceland, for example, reported 261 that smaller birth size (considered a measure of intrauterine experience) was related to poorer 262 cognitive function at the age of 75, providing the first evidence that even the time before birth is 263 relevant to cognitive ageing.(67) Other mechanisms includes: impaired growth leading to reduced 264 maximal lung function; exposure to environmental factors affecting lung function and 265 development, such as tobacco smoke (direct or indirect);(68) illness, such as childhood lower 266 respiratory tract infections(69) and airway hyperresponsiveness;(70) socioeconomic factors 267 (poverty, educational failure, and less-advantaged social class,(71-77); environmental factors 268 affecting lung function, such as atmospheric pollution(72) and local exposure to traffic.(78, 79) 269 270 Third, both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia may share some aetiology with 271 cardiovascular disease and this overlap in the conditions might explain the association, 272 independent of smoking.(80-82) It has been hypothesised that oxidative stress, inflammation, 273 and amyloid deposition may link these two important conditions.(83, 84) In particular, oxidative 274 stress and synaptic dysfunction appear to be closely linked(85) and brain ischaemia -which 275 could result from cerebral atherosclerosis and stroke -causes oxidative stress-mediated 276 damage.(86) This may possibly be exacerbated by the pro-inflammatory function of APOE, but 277 this effect is controversial.(87) (88) 278 279 Clinical and public health implications 280 In terms of prevention, the possibility that the association between pulmonary function and 281 cognition might reflect a cause-and-effect relation is particularly important. To date, however, 282 plausible mechanisms linking pulmonary function to dementia include both causal and non-283 causal explanations and further research on this issue is therefore needed.(9) 284 285",
