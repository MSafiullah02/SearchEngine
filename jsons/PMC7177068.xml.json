Secondary losses, as the consequences of primary losses, are often overlooked because they seem covert early on but will emerge as significant issues subsequently. Individuals who lost loved ones may face secondary losses such as losses of companionship, sexual intimacy, and family role. Those recovered from severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 may be at higher risk of chronic cardiovascular damage (Zheng et al., 2020) which, as the primary loss, brings secondary losses such as losses of abilities and identity. Further, many cities are on lockdown. The loss of freedom can lead to secondary losses such as losses of relationship, recreation, and social support. Social distancing minimizes emotional and physical intimacy, which results in dissolution of intimate relationships involving partners, family, and friends. Moreover, over 16 million U.S. population filed for unemployment within three weeks in March 2020 during the pandemic (DOL, 2020). Job loss, as a primary loss, brings losses of financial security, independence, healthcare, and sense of future.",

Civilians experience losses of relationship, freedom, and employment within a constricted time period. First responders experience a surge in deaths caused by COVID-19, and bereavement overload will impair their health (Allie et al., 2018). Additionally, more individuals experience ambiguous loss amid the pandemic. For example, first responders and patients under quarantine may experience physical separation with family, although they stay emotionally and psychologically connected. Furthermore, some individuals with COVID-19 experience stigmatized loss as they are blamed for contraction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, stigmatized loss leads to alienation, which impairs grievers\u2019 support network.",

Grieving process reflects a unique convergence of responses (affective, cognitive, behavioural, physical, spiritual adjustments). Individuals having patients or family with severe complications of COVID-19 may experience anticipatory grief. For frontline healthcare workers, the huge surge in deaths is distressing. They experience anticipatory grief and perceive discontinuation of mechanical ventilation as emotionally onerous and psychologically difficult, but having little time for mourning due to the intensifying situation. Many families experience anticipatory grief because knowing their loved ones suffering and missing out on the final moment are poignant. Moreover, the absence of ritual, such as funeral, often results in disenfranchised grief, and lacking social or cultural recognition impairs support resources that assist the grieving process. As a result of unusual prolonged and disabling grief, more individuals are at greater risk of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in this pandemic. PGD will imperil mental and physical wellbeing consequently because of the disturbance causing significant impairment in essential areas of functioning.",

            "text": "Increasing knowledge of the idiosyncratic nature of loss and grief is essential to inform the development of tailored strategies to help grievers adapt to loss in this challenging time. First, loss adaptation should be preferred over loss coping. Adaptation allows grievers to continually adjust to ongoing changes posed by the crisis. Contrastingly, coping implies a time-limited response to an event with specific skills (Corr and Doka, 2001). Second, mental health professionals should encourage the exploration and employment of adaptive strategies (affective, cognitive, behavioural, physical, spiritual) consistent with grievers\u2019 personality and varying situations. Third, meaning reconstruction promotes functional adaptation to loss. Significant losses cause the disruptions of beliefs and expectations constituting one\u2019s meaning structures, which yields cognitive dissonance that results in substantial distress, hampering functional loss adaptation. By helping grievers understand and rebuild disrupted beliefs and expectations, mental health professionals can facilitate grievers\u2019 functional integration of loss and help them reconnect to self and the world. Lastly, identifying and developing resilience traits, such as self-efficacy and social support, will empower grievers to adapt to disturbances in the grieving process (Vegsund et al., 2019). It is therefore crucial to help grievers recognize strengths and abilities to amplify individual resilience.",
