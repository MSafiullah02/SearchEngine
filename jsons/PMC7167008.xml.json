The basic reproduction number is the most important parameter to determine the intrinsic transmissibility, defined as the average number of secondary infectious cases generated by an index case in a completely susceptible population without any interventions.\n1\n During the outbreak of an epidemic, due to interventions and control measures from government, reaction of personal behaviors (sterilizing, wearing masks, washing hands, reducing contacts, etc.), the depletion of susceptible populations, and the seasonality of transmissibility, the basic reproduction number is generalized to the effective reproduction number, which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by an infectious case at time t, and is denoted by Rt.

Most Chinese people were aware of the outbreak of 2019\u2010nCoV by the mainstream media after 20 January 2020. The Hubei government released the announcement about strengthening the prevention and control measures against 2019\u2010nCoV, and launched the second\u2010level public health emergency response at 2:40 am on January 22, 2020. Thus, the public awareness and effective interventions were absent when the time was prior to this point. As the median value of the incubation period of SARS was 6.4 days (95% CI 5.2 to 7.7 days) \n3\n, and the 2019\u2010nCoV incubation period was 5.1 days according to a recent report on a few confirmed cases,\n4\n we inferred that the confirmed cases before January 26, 2020 were infected during the free propagation of 2019\u2010nCoV.

At each time step (in days in later analyses), a susceptible individual would turn to be an exposed individual with probability \u03b2 if she/he contacts with an infected individual, an exposed individual had a probability \u03b31 to become infected, and an infected would be removed with probability \u03b32. The dynamical process of SEIR thus could be described as:\ndStdt=\u2212\u03b2StItN,dEtdt=\u03b2StItN\u2212\u03b31Et,dItdt=\u03b31Et\u2212\u03b32It,dRtdt=\u03b32It,where S(t), E(t), I(t), and R(t), respectively, represent the number of individuals in the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered states at time t, and N is the total number of individuals in the system such that N = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t). The infected population during early transmission was negligible compared with the total population, that is, when t approaches 0, S(t) approaches to N. The basic reproduction number could then be approximated as \n6\n:\nR0=1+\u03bb\u03b311+\u03bb\u03b32,where \u03bb=lnY(t)/t is the growth rate of the early exponential growth and Y(t) is the number of infected people with symptom by time t. The exposed period and the infection period could be expressed as TE=1/\u03b31 and TI=1/\u03b32. Generation time could then be approximated as Tg=TE+TI. Denote by \u03c1=TE/Tg the ratio of exposed period to generation time, the basic reproduction number could be rewritten as\nR0=1+\u03bbTg+\u03c1(1\u2212\u03c1)(\u03bbTg)2.\n",

In reality, there should be a certain fraction of infected people with symptoms having not been found.\n2\n, \n7\n, \n8\n If we ignored this situation and suppose that there will be a fraction q of the suspected cases would be confirmed further (on the basis of an early report that 41 of the 59 suspected cases were eventually confirmed, the reference value of q was 41/59 = 0.695), then the number of cases with symptoms on 25 January was Y(t)=2032\u00d70.695+1408=2820. Note that the real number of cases was probably much larger than 2820. We considered this number as the optimistic situation (the lower bound of the number of cases having onset of symptoms). If we took the Northeastern University Reports \n2\n as the reference, there would be about 4050 cases on January 20, 2020, and about 12 700 cases on January 24, 2020. This result was mainly based on the number of confirmed cases in overseas that were exported from Wuhan. Even though there might be a large bias due to the highly limited samples, it should be seriously considered as all other methods were also very preliminary and some reports \n7\n, \n8\n showed similar results to the Northeastern University Reports.\n2\n Read et al \n8\n inferred that the actual number of confirmed cases was only 5.1%, including the cases without symptoms. If only 5% of symptomatic infections were detected (more pessimistic than the results of Read's study \n8\n), then according to the confirmed cases (1408) by January 25, the number of cases with symptoms was 28 160, 10 times larger than the optimistic one. We used it as the upper bound of Y(t) in sensitivity analysis. We set the date December 8, 2019, the presence time of the first pneumonia of unknown etiology, as t = 0. In fact, t might be slightly earlier than December 8, since the symptoms might have appeared for some time before to the hospital. Hence, the estimated basic reproduction number might be a bit higher by using December 8, 2019 as t = 0. Based on the above analysis, we mainly used Y(48) = 2820 from the People's Daily Reports, and Y(43) = 4050, Y(47) = 12 700 form the Northeastern University Reports.\n2\n\n",

As the formula \u03c1(1\u2212\u03c1) was symmetry, the range, that is, [0.5, 1], covers all possible values of \u03c1. Lipsitch et al \n10\n showed that the average of Tg is 8.4 days for SARS, while in the early outbreaks Tg was higher (the average value was 10.0 days), and they suggested the sensitivity analysis interval as Tg\u2208[8,12]. Imai et al \n11\n claimed that the case study reported in Chan's research \n4\n indicated that 2019\u2010nCoV has a much shorterTg. However, we could not yet obtain any solid estimation about the value of Tg as the number of samples was too small and the questionnary survey did not sufficiently cover the interests about genration time. Therefore, we mainly concentrated on Tg=8.4(days) and Tg=10.0 (days), and took sensitivity analysis with the same interval \n8\n, \n12\n as suggested by Lipsitch et al.\n10\n\n",

The basic reproduction number of SARS by Wallinga and Teunis \n13\n was from 3.1 to 4.2, which was not lower than our pessimistic result. Therefore, if we rely on the People's Daily Reports, the basic reproduction number of 2019\u2010nCoV was not higher than SARS, or even slightly lower than the basic reproduction number of SARS predicted by some other research teams. Even with the more predictions by the Northeastern University Reports, the basic reproduction number of 2019\u2010nCoV was only slightly higher than SARS. It was a controllable disease with moderate to high transmissibility.

Since a significant proportion of patients with 2019\u2010nCoV had mild symptoms, which could be healed without entering the hospital, there might be a large number of patients not in the official confirmed list. Consequently, we suggested it to be more prudent. For example, the design of control measure should refer to the more pessimistic estimation (based on the Northeastern University Reports) rather than the more optimistic one (based on the People's Daily Reports). Our model assumes that the individuals in exposed state did not have or have very lower level infectiousness (according to SARS), however, it was possible that for 2019\u2010nCoV, individuals in the exposed state still had considerable infectiousness.

The government's control policy and individuals\u2019 prevention behaviors were to reduce these parameters, and to eventually make the effective reproduction number Rt below 1. According to our results, if k\u03b2D could be reduced by 3/4 (to its 1/4), 2019\u2010nCoV could be effectively controlled. Staying at home and cancelled meetings could decrease the frequency of contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. Wearing masks and washing hands could reduce the transmission probability \u03b2. If the individuals exhibit the suspected symptoms or have contacts with the high\u2010risk groups, the corresponding medical observation and the isolation with other individuals were needed, which would shorten the effective infectious time period D. Restrictions on transportation, extension of winter holiday, and the cancellation of various conferences also aimed at reducing the effective reproductive number. Based on the preliminary information, a considerable amount of people infected with 2019\u2010nCoV only show mild symptoms, and thus they had the same mobility as healthy people in principle. There were also some preliminary epidemiological findings suggesting that infected cases had infectiousness during the exposed period. These reasons, together with the delayed responses by Wuhan government, lead to a fiercer outbreak of 2019\u2010nCoV than SARS. On the contrary, reducing the traveling and avoiding the meetings, in the meanwhile, wearing masks and washing hands frequently would suppress the effects caused by mild symptoms and exposed state with infectiousness.
