            "text": "Traditionally, infectious disease models have treated human behavior as a fixed phenomenon that does not respond to disease dynamics or any other natural dynamics. For many research questions, this is a useful and acceptable simplification. However, in other cases, human behavior responds to disease dynamics, and in turn disease dynamics responds to human behavior. For example, the initiation of an epidemic may cause a flood of awareness in the population such that protective measures are adopted. This in turn, reduces the transmission of the disease. In such cases, it becomes possible to speak of a single, coupled \u201cdisease\u2013behavior\u201d system where a human subsystem and a disease transmission subsystem are coupled to one another (see Fig. 2\n). Moreover, because the human and natural subsystems are themselves typically nonlinear, the coupled system is therefore also typically nonlinear. This means that phenomena can emerge that cannot be predicted by considering each subsystem in isolation. For example, protective behavior on the part of humans may ebb and flow according to disease incidence and according to a characteristic timescale (as opposed to being constant over time, as would occur in the uncoupled subsystems).",

            "text": "To explore strategic interactions between individual behaviors, game theory has become a key tool across many disciplines. It provides a unified framework for decision-making, where the participating players in a conflict must make strategy choices that potentially affect the interest of other players. Game theory and its corresponding equilibrium concepts, such as the Nash Equilibrium, emerged in seminal works from the 1940s and 1950s [5], [6]. A Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies such that no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from the present strategy. That is, the Nash Equilibrium makes strategies form best responses to one other, since every player, who has a consistent goal to maximize his own benefit or utility, is perfectly rational. Game theory has been applied to fields such as economics, biology, mathematics, public health, ecology, traffic engineering, and computer science [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. For example, in voluntary vaccination programs, the formal theory of games can be employed as a framework to analyze the vaccination equilibrium level in populations [9], [13], [14]. In the context of vaccination, the feedback between individual decisions of vaccination (or other prevention behaviors) and disease spreading is captured, hence these systems exemplify coupled disease\u2013behavior systems.",

It thus becomes instructive to relax some key assumptions, such as the introduction of bounded rationality. Game theory has been extended into evolutionary biology, which has generated great insight into the evolution of strategies [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] under both biological and cultural evolution. For instance, the replicator equation, which consists of sets of differential equations describing how the strategies of a population evolve over time under selective pressures, has also been used to study learning in various scenarios [20]. Except for temporal concepts, spatial interaction topology has also proved to be crucial in determining system equilibria (also see Refs. [16], [17] for a comprehensive overview). Evolutionary game theory has been extensively applied to behavioral epidemiology, whose details will be surveyed in the following sections.",

Most populations are spatially structured in the sense that individuals preferentially interact with those who share close geographic proximity. Perhaps, the most simple population structure is a regular lattice: all the agents are assigned specific locations on it, normally a two-dimensional square lattice, just like atoms in crystal lattice sites, which interact with only nearest neighbors. In a regular lattice population, each individual meets the same people they interact with regularly, rather than being randomly reshuffled into a homogeneous mixture, as in well-mixed population models. In addition, another type of homogeneous network attracting great research interest is the Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) graph [21], which is a graph where nodes are linked up randomly and which is often used in the rigorous analysis of graphs and networks.",

            "text": "However, in reality, there is ubiquitous heterogeneity in the number of contacts per individual, and recent studies have shown that the distribution of contact numbers of some social networks is not homogeneous but appears to follow a power-law [22]. Moreover, social contact networks also display small-world properties (i.e., short average path length between any two individuals and strong local clustering tendency), which cannot be well described by regular lattices or random graphs [23]. With both motivations, two significant milestones were born in the late 90s: the theoretical models of small-world (SW) networks and scale-free (SF) networks [24], [25]. Subsequently, more properties of social networks have been extensively investigated, such as community structure (a kind of assortative structure where individuals are divided into groups such that the members within each group are mostly connected with each other) [26], clusters [27], and the recent proposal of multilayer as well as time-varying frameworks [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. Due to the broad applicability of complex networks, network models have been widely employed in epidemiology to study the spread of infectious diseases [27]. In networks, a vertex represents an individual and an edge between two vertices represents a contact over which disease transmission may occur. An epidemic spreads through the network from infected to susceptible vertices.",

            "text": "With the advent of various network algorithms, it becomes instructive incorporating disease dynamics into such infrastructures to explore the impact of spatial contact patterns [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. Replacing the homogeneous mixing hypothesis that any individual can come into contact with any other agents, networked epidemic research assumes that each individual has comparable number of contacts, denoted by its degree k. Under this treatment, the most significant physics finding is that network topology will directly determine the threshold of epidemic outbreak and phase transition. For example, compared with the finite epidemic threshold of random network, Romualdo et al. found that disease with SIS dynamics and even a very small transmission rate can spread and persist in the SF networks (i.e., there is absence of a disease threshold) [39]. This point helps to explain why it is extremely difficult to eradicate viruses on Internet and World Wide Web, and why those viruses have an unusual long lifetime. But the absence of epidemic threshold is only suitable for SF networks with a power-law degree distribution P(k)\u223ck\u2212\u03b3 with \u03b3\u2208(2,3]. If \u03b3 is extended to the range (3,4), an anomalous critical behavior takes place [39], [40]. To show the condition of disease spread, it is meaningful to define the relative spreading rate \u03bb\u2261\u03b2/\u03bc. The larger is \u03bb, the more likely the disease will spread. Generally, for an SF network with arbitrary degree distribution, the epidemic threshold is(3)\u03bbc=\u3008k\u3009\u3008k2\u3009. In particular, for an SF network \u3008k2\u3009 diverges in the N\u2192\u221e limit, and so the epidemic threshold is expected to die out. Similarly, it is easy to derive the threshold of SIR model(4)\u03bbc=\u3008k\u3009\u3008k2\u3009\u2212\u3008k\u3009, which is related with average degree \u3008k\u3009 and the second moment \u3008k2\u3009 of networks as well. Along these findings, more endeavors are devoted to the epidemic threshold of spatial networks with various properties, such as degree correlation [41], [42], SW topology [23], community structure [43], and k-core [44]. On the other hand, more analysis and prediction methods (such as mean-field method, generation function) are also proposed to explain the transition of disease on realistic networks [27], [45] and immunization strategies of spatial networks are largely identified [46].",

Specifically, when \u03c4=1, there is a value of J for which an epidemic can be stopped in regular lattices and SW networks [25]. However, for certain SF networks, there is no value of J that is able to stop the disease from spreading. In order to achieve disease extinction in these networks, hub nodes must adopt additional self-protective measure, which is accomplished by decreasing \u03c4 for these individuals.

In Section 2, we will focus on the disease\u2013behavior dynamics of homogeneously mixed populations, and discuss when the homogeneous mixing approximation is or is not valid. This provides a comprehensive prologue to the overview of the coupled systems on networks in Section 3. Within the latter, we separately review dynamics in different types of networked populations, which are frequently viewed through the lens of physical phenomena (such as phase transitions and pattern formation) and analyzed with physics-based methods (like Monte Carlo simulation, mean-field prediction). Based on all these achievements, we can capture how coupled disease\u2013behavior dynamics affects disease transmission and spatial contact patterns. Section 4 will be devoted to empirical concerns, such as types of data that can be used for these study systems, and how questionnaires and digital equipment can be used to collect data on relevant social and contact networks. In addition, it is meaningful to examine whether some social behaviors predicted by models really exist in vaccination experiments and surveys. Finally, we will conclude with a summary and an outlook in Section 5, describing the implications of statistical physics of spatial disease\u2013behavior dynamics and outlining viable directions for future research. Throughout, we will generally focus on preventive measures other than vaccination (such as social distancing and hand washing), although we will also touch upon vaccination in a few places.",

            "text": "The discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and its large economic impacts stimulated research into behaviorally based mathematical models of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In disease\u2013behavior models, a population often initiates a behavior change in response to an increasing prevalence of a disease. In the context of STDs, this change in behavior may include safer sex practices, or a reduction in the number of partnerships individuals seek out. Following this prevalence-based decision making principle, researchers have used the concept of utility maximization to study the behavior dynamics of a population [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]. In these models, individuals seek to maximize their utility by solving dynamic optimization problems. Utility is derived by members of the population when engaging in increased levels of social contact. However, this increased contact or partner change rate also increases the chance of becoming infected. One consequence of this dynamic is that higher levels of prevalence can result in increased prophylactic behavior, which in turn decreases the prevalence over time. As this occurs, self-protective measures used by the population will also fall, which may cause disease cycles [53], [56]. Nonetheless, in the case of STDs which share similar transmission pathways, a population protecting themselves from one disease by reducing contact rates can also indirectly protect themselves from another disease simultaneously [53]. In general, the lowering of contact rates in response to an epidemic can reduce its size, and also delay new infections [57]. However, this observed reduction of contact rates may not be uniform across the whole population. For example, an increase in prevalence may cause the activity rates of those with already low social interaction to fall even further, but this effect may not hold true for those with high activity rates [54]. In fact, the high-risk members of the population will gain a larger fraction of high-risk partners in this scenario, resulting from the low-risk members reducing their social interaction rates. This dynamic serves to increase the risk of infection of high activity individuals even further. These utility-based economic models show us that when considering health outcomes, one must be acutely aware of the welfare costs associated with self-protective behavior or implementing disease mitigation policies [56]. A health policy, such as encouraging infectious individuals to self-quarantine, may actually cause a rise in disease prevalence due to susceptible individuals feeling less threatened by infection and subsequently abandoning their own self-protective behavior [56]. Also, a population who is given a pessimistic outlook of an epidemic may in fact cause the disease to spread more rapidly [55].",

Also, the basic reproductive number of a disease must exceed a certain threshold for individuals to feel self-protective behavior is worth the effort [58]. In scenarios where the contact rate of the population increases with the number of people out in public, a Nash Equilibrium exists, but the level of self-protective behavior in it is not socially optimal [59]. Nonetheless, these models also show that the activation of social distancing can weaken an epidemic.",

            "text": "Some models of disease\u2013behavior dynamics, rather than assuming humans are attempting to optimize a utility function, represent human behavior by specifying rules that humans follow under certain conditions. These could include both phenomenological rules describing phenomenological responses to changes in prevalence, or more complex psychological mechanisms. Rule-based compartmental models using systems of differential equations have also used to study heterogeneous behavior and the use of NPIs by a population during an epidemic. A wide range of diseases are modeled using this approach, such as HIV [61], [62], [63], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [64], [65], or influenza [63], [66]. These models often utilize additional compartments, which are populated according to specific rules. Examples of such rules are to construct the compartments to hold a constant amount of individuals associated with certain contact rates [61], [62], [67], or to add and remove individuals at a constant rate [63], [64], [65], [68], a rate depending on prevalence [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], or according to a framework where behavior that is more successful is imitated by others [66], [75], [76]. Extra compartments signify behavioral heterogeneities amongst members of a population, and the disease transmission rates associated with them also vary. Reduction in transmission due to adaptive behavior is either modeled as a quarantine of cases [63], [64], [65], or prophylactic behavior of susceptible individuals due to increased awareness of the disease [66], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [77]. These models agree that early activation of isolation measures and self-protective behavior can weaken an epidemic. However, due to an early decrease in new infections, populations may see a subsequent decrease in NPI use causing multiple waves of infection [69], [71], [75], [76]. Contrasting opinions on the impact behavioral changes have on the epidemic threshold also result from these models. For example, Perra et al. [71] show that although infection size is reduced, prophylactic behavior does not alter the epidemic threshold. However, the models studied by Poletti et al. [75] and Sahneh et al. [70] show that the epidemic threshold can be altered by behavioral changes in a population.",

In the seminal work, Funk and coworkers [78] formulated and analyzed a mathematical model for the spread of awareness in well-mixed and spatially structured populations to understand how the awareness of disease and also its propagation impact the spatial spread of a disease. In their model, both disease and the information about the disease spread spontaneously by, respectively, contact and word of mouth in the population. The classical epidemiological SIR model is used for epidemic spreading, and the information dynamics is governed by both information transmission and information fading. The immediate outcome of the awareness of the disease information is the decrease in the possibility of acquiring the infectious disease when a susceptible individual (who was aware of the epidemic) contacts with an infected one. In a well-mixed population, the authors found that, the coupling spreading dynamics of both the epidemic and the awareness of it can result in a lower size of the outbreak, yet it does not affect the epidemic threshold. However, in a population located on the triangular lattice, the behavioral response can completely stop a disease from spreading, provided the infection rate is below a threshold. Specifically, the authors showed that the impact of locally spreading awareness is amplified if the social network of potential infection events and the communication network over which individuals communicate overlap, especially so if the networks have a high level of clustering.",

Mathematically, the local behavioral response is cast into the reduction factor (1\u2212\u03b8)\u03c8 in the contact rate of a susceptible node, where \u03c8 is the number of infected neighbors and \u03b8<1 is a parameter characterizing the response strength of the individuals to the epidemic.

In their model, rather than the normally used link-rewiring process, an intermittent social distancing strategy is adopted to disturb the epidemic spreading process. Particularly, based on local information, a susceptible individual is allowed to interrupt the contact with an infected individual with a probability \u03c3 and restore it after a fixed time tb, such that the underlying interaction network of the individuals remains unchanged. Using the framework of percolation theory, the authors found that there exists a cutoff threshold \u03c3c, whose value depends on the network topology (i.e., the extent of heterogeneity of the degree distribution), beyond which the epidemic phase disappears. The efficiency of the intermittent social distancing strategy in stopping the spread of diseases is owing to the emergent \u201csusceptible herd behavior\u201d among the population that protects a large fraction of susceptible individuals.",

To explore the role of individual imitation behavior and population structure in vaccination, recent seminal work integrated an epidemiological process into a simple agent-based model of adaptive learning, where individuals use anecdotal evidence to estimate costs and benefits of vaccination [85]. Under such a model, the disease\u2013behavior dynamics is modeled as a two-stage process. The first stage is a public vaccination campaign, which occurs before any epidemic spreading. At this stage, each individual decides whether or not to vaccinate, and taking vaccine incurs a cost CV to the vaccinated individuals. The vaccine is risk-free and offers perfect protection against infection. The second stage is the disease transmission process, where the classic SIR compartmental model is adopted. During the whole epidemic spreading process, those susceptible individuals who caught the disease incur an infection cost CI, which is usually assumed to be larger than the cost CV for vaccination. Those unvaccinated individuals who remain healthy are free-riding off the vaccination efforts of others (i.e., no any cost), and they are indirectly protected by herd immunity. For simplicity, the authors rescale these costs by defining the relative cost of vaccination c=CV/CI (0<c<1) and CI=1. As such, after each epidemic season, all the individuals will get some payoffs (equal to the negative value of corresponding costs) dependent on their vaccination strategies and also on whether they are infected or not, then they are allowed to change or keep their old strategies for the next season, depending on their current payoffs. The rule of thumb is that the strategy of a role model with higher payoff is more likely to be imitated. By doing so, each individual i randomly chooses another individual j from the neighborhood as role model, and imitates the behavior of j with the probability(6)\u03a0i\u2192j=11+exp\u2061[\u2212\u03b2(Pj\u2212Pi)], where Pi and Pj are, respectively, the payoffs of two involved individuals, and \u03b2 (0<\u03b2<\u221e) denotes the strength of selection. This form of decision alternative is also known as the Fermi law [16], [86] in physics. A finite value of \u03b2 accounts for the fact that better performing individuals are readily imitated, although it is not impossible to imitate one agent performing worse, for example due to imperfect information or errors in decision making.",

In reality, whether or not to change behavior depends not only on the personal success of each individual, but also on the success and/or behavior of others. Using this as motivation, the authors incorporated the impact of peer pressure into a susceptible-vaccinated-infected-recovered (SVIR) epidemiological model, where the propensity to adopt a particular vaccination strategy depends both on individual success as well as on the strategy-configuration of their neighbors. To be specific, the behavior imitation probability of individual i towards its immediate neighbor j (namely, Eq. (6)) becomes(7)\u03a0i\u2192j=(Ni/ki)\u03b111+exp\u2061[\u2212\u03b2(Pj\u2212Pi)], where Ni is the number of neighbors that have a different vaccination strategy than the individual i, and ki is the interaction degree of i, and the parameter \u03b1 determines just how seriously the peer pressure is considered. Under such a scenario, Fig. 3\ndisplays how vaccination and infection vary as a function of vaccine cost in ER random graph. It is clear that plugging into the peer pressure also works as a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d, which, on the one hand, strongly promotes vaccine uptake in the population when its cost is below a critical value, but, on the other hand, it may also strongly impede it if the critical value is exceeded. The reason is due to the fact that the presence of peer-pressure can facilitate cluster formation among the individuals, whose behaviors are inclined to conform to the majority of their neighbors, similar to the early report of cooperation behavior [88]. Such behavioral conformity is found to expedite the spread of disease when the relative cost for vaccination is high enough, while promote the vaccine coverage in the opposite case.",

But that may not actually be the case. Liu et al. proposed that a few will be \u201ccommitted\u201d to vaccination, perhaps because they have a low threshold for feeling at risk (or strongly held convictions), and they will want to be immunized as soon as they hear that someone is infected [87]. They studied how the presence of committed vaccinators, a small fraction of individuals who consistently hold the vaccinating strategy and are immune to influence, impacts the vaccination dynamics in well-mixed and spatially structured populations. The researchers showed that even a relatively small proportion of these agents (such as 5%) can significantly reduce the scale of an epidemic, as shown in Fig. 4\n. The effect is much stronger when all the individuals are uniformly distributed on a square lattice, as compared to the case of well-mixed population. Their results suggested that those committed individuals can have a remarkable effect, acting as \u201csteadfast role models\u201d in the population to seed vaccine uptake in others while also disrupting the appearance of clusters of free-riders, which might otherwise seed the emergence of a global epidemic.",

Another good example can be found in a recent work [89], in which Zhang et al. proposed an evolutionary epidemic game where individuals can choose their strategies as vaccination, self-protection or laissez faire, towards infectious diseases and adjust their strategies according to their neighbors' strategies and payoffs. The \u201cdisease\u2013behavior\u201d coupling dynamical process is similar to the one implemented by Ref. [85], where the SIR epidemic spreading process and the strategy updating process succeed alternatively. By both stochastic simulations and theoretical analysis, the authors found a counter-intuitive phenomenon that a better condition (i.e., larger successful rate of self-protection) may unfortunately result in less system payoff. The trick is that, when the successful rate of self-protection increases, people become more speculative and less interested in vaccination. Since a vaccinated individual brings the \u201cexternality\u201d effect to the system: the individual's decision to vaccinate diminishes not only its own risk of infection, but also the risk for those people with whom the individual interacts, the reduction of vaccination can remarkably enhance the risk of infection. The observed counter-intuitive phenomenon is reminiscent of the well-known Braess's Paradox in traffic, where more roads may lead to more severe traffic congestion [90]. This work provides another interesting example analogous to Braess's Paradox, namely, a higher successful rate of self-protection may eventually enlarge the epidemic size and thus diminish positive health outcomes.",

The government should carefully consider how to distribute their resources and money between messages supporting vaccination, hospitalization, self-protection, and so on, since the outcome of policy largely depends on the complex interplay among the type of incentive, individual behavioral responses, and the intrinsic epidemic dynamics. In their further work [91], the authors investigated the effects of two types of incentives strategies, partial-subsidy policy in which certain fraction of the cost of vaccination is offset, and free-subsidy policy in which donees are randomly selected and vaccinated at no cost on the epidemic control. Through mean-field analysis and computations, they found that, under the partial-subsidy policy, the vaccination coverage depends monotonically on the sensitivity of individuals to payoff difference, but the dependence is non-monotonous for the free-subsidy policy. Due to the role models of the donees for relatively irrational individuals and the unchanged strategies of the donees for rational individuals, the free-subsidy policy can in general lead to higher vaccination coverage. These findings substantiate, once again, that any disease-control policy should be exercised with extreme care: its success depends on the complex interplay among the intrinsic mathematical rules of epidemic spreading, governmental policies, and behavioral responses of individuals.",

However, in some scenarios, the simple hypothesis that individuals are connected to each other in the same infrastructure (namely, the so-called single-layer network in Section 3.1) may generate overestimation or underestimation for the diffusion and prevention of disease, since agents can simultaneously be the elements of more than one network in most, yet not all, empirical systems [28], [29], [100]. In this sense, it seems constructive to go beyond the traditional single-layer network theory and propose a new architecture, which can incorporate the multiple roles or connections of individuals into an integrated framework. The multilayer networks, defined as the combination class of networks interrelated in a nontrivial way (usually by sharing nodes), have recently become a fundamental tool to quantitatively describe the interaction among network layers as well as between these constituents.",

Aiming to explore the interrelation between social awareness and disease spreading, Granell et al. recently incorporated information awareness into a disease model embedded in a multiplex network [110], where the physical contact layer supports epidemic process and the virtual contact layer supports awareness diffusion. Similar to SIS model (where the S node can be infected with a transmission probability \u03b2, and the I node recovers with a certain rate \u03bc), the awareness dynamics, composed of aware (A) and unaware (U) states, assumes that a node of state A may lose its awareness with probability \u03b4, and re-obtains awareness in the probability \u03bd. Then, both processes can be coupled via the combinations of individual states: unaware-susceptible (US), aware-susceptible (AS), and aware-infected (AI), which are also revealed by the transition probability trees in Fig. 6\n.",

To capture more realistic scenarios, the authors relaxed both assumptions and introduced mass media that disseminates information to the entire system [111]. They found that the vaccine coverage of aware individuals and the mass media affect the critical relation between two competing processes. More importantly, the existence of mass media makes the metacritical point (where the critical onset of the epidemics starts) of Ref. [110] disappear. Furthermore, the social dynamics are further extended to an awareness cascade model [112], during which agents exhibit herd-like behavior because they make decisions referring to the actions of other individuals. Interestingly, it is found that a local awareness ratio (of unaware individuals becoming aware ones) approximating 0.5 has a two-stage effect on the epidemic threshold (i.e., an abrupt transition of epidemic threshold) and can cause different epidemic sizes, irrespective of the network structure. That is to say, when the local awareness ratio is in the range of [0,0.5), the epidemic threshold is a fixed and larger value; however, in the range of [0.5,1], threshold value becomes a fixed yet smaller value. As for the final epidemic size, its increasing speed for the interval [0,0.5) is much slower than the speed when local awareness ratio lies in [0.5,1]. These findings suggest a new way of understanding realistic contagions and their prevention. Except for obtaining awareness from aware neighbors, self-awareness induced by infected neighbors is another scenario that currently attracts research attention [113], where it is found that coupling such a dynamical process with disease spreading can lower the density of infection, but does not increase the epidemic threshold regardless of the information source.",

Thus far, many achievements have shown that considering simultaneous diffusion of disease and prevention measures on the same single-layer network is an effective method to evaluate the incidence and onset of disease [79], [85], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [114]. However, if both processes are coupled on the multilayer infrastructure, how does it affect the spreading and prevention of disease? Inspired by this interesting question, Ref. [115] suggested a conceptual framework, where two fully or partially coupled networks are employed, to transmit disease (an infection layer) and to channel individual decision of prevention behaviors (a communication layer). Protection strategies considered include wearing facemasks, washing hands frequently, taking pharmaceutical drugs, and avoiding contact with sick people, which are the only means of control in situations where vaccines are not yet available. It is found that the structure of the infection network, rather than the communication network, has a dramatic influence on the transmission of disease and uptake of protective measures. In particular, during an influenza epidemic, the coupled model can lead to a lower infection rates, which indicates that single-layer models may overestimate disease transmission.",

By means of numerous simulations and mean-field analysis, they found that, for uncorrelated coupling architecture, a disease outbreak in the contact layer induces an outbreak of disease in the communication layer, and information diffusion can effectively raise the epidemic threshold.

In the adaptive viewpoint, the most straightforward method of avoiding contact with infective acquaintances amounts to breaking the links between susceptible and infective agents and constructing novel connections. Along such lines, Thilo et al. first proposed an adaptive scenario: a susceptible node is able to prune the infected link and rewire with a healthy agent with a certain probability [124]. The probability of switching can be regarded as a measurement of strength of the protection strategy. It is shown that different values of this probability give rise to various degree mixing patterns and degree distributions. Based on the low-dimensional approximations, the authors also showed that their adaptive framework is able to predict novel dynamical features, such as bistability, hysteresis, and first order transitions, which are sufficiently robust against disease dynamics [125], [126]. In spite of great advances, the existing analytical methods cannot generally allow for accurate predictions about the simultaneous time evolution of disease and network topology. To overcome this limitation, Vincent et al. further introduced an improved compartmental formalism, which proves that the initial conditions play a crucial role in disease spreading [127].",

Under such operations, the authors observed that the number of infected agents stays at a low level for a long time, and then suddenly erupts to high level before declining to a low level again. This process repeats several times until the final eradication of infection, as illustrated in Fig. 7\n(a). With regard to potential mechanism, it is actually related with the invasion of infected individuals to susceptible giant components. Link-removal process can suppress disease spreading, which makes susceptible (infected) agents form giant components (small yet non-isolated clusters), as shown in Fig. 7(b). But, the entrance of new nodes may bring new infection risk to such giant components, which accelerates next outbreak of infection and network crashing again (see Fig. 7(c)).

An interesting question naturally poses itself: is there an adaptive scenario that preserves the degree distribution of networks? That is, each individual has a characteristic behavior: keeping total number of its neighbors constant. To fill up this gap, neighbor exchange model becomes a very useful tool [130], where individual number of current neighbors remains fixed while the compositions or entities of those contacts change in time. Similar to famous algorithm of Watts\u2013Strogatz SW network [25], such a model allows an exchange mechanism in which the destination nodes of two edges are swapped with a given rate. Incorporating the diffusion of epidemic, this model constructs a bridge between static network model and mass-action model. Based on the empirical data, the authors further displayed that the application of this model is very effective to forecast and control sexually transmitted disease outbreak. Along this way, the potential influence of other topology properties (such as growing networks [131] and rewiring SF networks [132]) has recently been identified in the adaptive viewpoint, which dramatically changes the outbreak threshold of disease.",

As in static networks, vaccination can also be introduced into adaptive architectures, where connection adjustment is an individual response to the presence of infection risk among neighborhoods. Motivated by realistic immunization situations, disease prevention is implemented by adding Poisson-distributed vaccination to susceptible individuals [133]. Because of the interplay between network rewiring and vaccination application, the authors showed that vaccination is far more effective in an adaptive network than a static one, irrespective of disease dynamics. Similarly, some other control measures are further encapsulated into adaptive community networks [134]. Except for various transition of community structure, both immunization and quarantine strategies show a counter-intuitive result that it is not \u201cthe earlier, the better\u201d for prevention of disease. Moreover, it is unveiled that the prevention efficiency of both measures is greatly different, and the optimal effect is obtained when a strong community structure exists.",

In contrast to the mutual feedback between dynamics and structure in adaptive frameworks, time-varying networks provide a novel angle for network research, where network connection and dynamics process evolve according to their respective rules [135], [136], [137]. For example, Summin et al. recently explored how to lower the number of vaccinated people to protect the whole system on time-varying networks [138]. Based on the past information, they could accurately administer vaccination and estimate disease outbreaks in future, which proves that time-varying structure can make protection protocols more efficient. In [139], the authors displayed that limited information on the contact patterns is sufficient to design efficient immunization strategies once again. But in these two works, the vaccination strategy is somewhat independent of human behavior and decision-making process, which leaves an open issue: if realistic disease\u2013behavior dynamics is introduced into time-varying topology (especially combining with the diffusion process of opinion cluster [140]), how does it affect the eradication of disease? We continue to discuss some of these and similar issues in Section 4 on empirically-derived networks.",

To test its potential impact on disease spreading, Martial et al. recently integrated a behavior epidemiology model with decision-making process into three archetypical realistic networks: Poisson Network, Urban Network and Power Law Network [93]. Under these contact networks, an agent can make decision either based purely on payoff maximization or via imitating the vaccination behavior of its neighbor (as suggest by Eq. (6)), which is controlled by the fraction of imitators \u0398. By means of numerous simulations, they displayed the diploid effect of imitation behavior: it enhances vaccination coverage for low vaccination cost, but impedes vaccination campaign at relatively high cost, which is depicted by Fig. 8\n. Surprisingly, in spite of high vaccination coverage, imitation can generate the clusters of non-vaccinating, susceptible agents, which in turn accelerate the large-scale outbreak of infectious disease (namely, imitation behavior, to some extent, impedes the eradication of infectious diseases). This point helps to explain why outbreaks of measles have recently occurred in many countries with high overall vaccination coverage [140], [143], [144]. With the same social networks, Ref. [141] explored the impact of heterogeneous contact patterns on disease outbreak in the compartmental model of SARS. It is interesting that, compared with the prediction of well-mixed population, the same set of basic reproductive number may lead to completely epidemiological outcomes in any two processes, which sheds light to the heterogeneity of SARS around the world.",

The authors found that contact networks are positively assortative with vaccination behavior. That is to say, large-degree unvaccinated (vaccinated) agents are more likely to contact with other large-degree unvaccinated (vaccinated) ones, which certainly results in a larger outbreak than common networks since these (positively assortative) unvaccinated agents breed larger susceptible clusters. This finding highlights the importance of heterogeneity during vaccine uptake for the prevention of infectious disease once again.",

However, such common consideration might not fully agree with human physiological limitations regarding the capacity in preserving a large number of interactions. Generally, the size of individual social network is restricted to around 150 people [158], [159].

Most contact durations and inter-contact intervals are very short, but long durations and intervals also emerge, which corresponds to a burst process without characteristic time scales [170].

Game theory has been extensively used in the study of behavior epidemiology, where individuals are usually assumed to decide vaccination or not based on the principle of maximizing self-interest [9], [175]. However, in reality, when people make vaccination decision, do they only consider their own benefit? To test this fundamental assumption, Ref. [176] recently conducted a survey about individual vaccination decisions during the influenza season. The questionnaires, from direct campus survey and Internet-based survey, are mainly composed of two items: self-interest ones (the concern about becoming infected) and altruistic ones (the concern about infecting others), as schematically illustrated in Fig. 12\n. If agents are driven by self-interest, they attempt to minimize their cost associated with vaccination and infection, which gives rise to selfish equilibrium (or the so-called Nash Equilibrium). By contrary, if individual decision is guided by altruistic motivation, the vaccination probability reaches community optimum (or the so-called Utilitarian Equilibrium), at which overall cost of the community is minimal. The authors unveiled that altruism plays an important role in vaccination decision, which can be quantitatively measured by \u201cdegree of altruism\u201d. To further evaluate its impact, they incorporated the empirical data and altruistic motivation into SVIR compartmental model. Interestingly, they found that altruism can shift vaccination decisions from individual self-interest to a community optimum via greatly enhancing total vaccination coverage and reducing the total cost, morbidity and mortality of the whole community, irrespective of parameter setup.",

According to general experience, elderly people, who are most likely to be infected in the case of influenza, should be most protected by young vaccinators, who are responsible for most disease transmission. To examine under which condition young agents vaccinate to better protect old ones, the authors organized the corresponding social behavior experiment: participants are randomly assigned to \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201celderly\u201d roles (with young players contributing more to herd immunity yet elderly players facing higher costs of infection). If players were paid based on individual point totals, more elderly than young players would get vaccinated, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction of self-interested behavior (namely, Nash Equilibrium). On the contrary, players paid according to the group point totals make decisions in a manner consistent with the Utilitarian Equilibrium, which predicts community-optimal behavior: more young than elderly players get vaccinated yet less cost. In this sense, payoff structure plays a vital role in the emergence of altruistic behavior, which in turn affects the disease spreading.",

Accompanying altruistic behavior, another type of behavior addressed within decision-making frameworks is free-riding behavior, which means that people can benefit from the action of others while avoiding any cost [79], [178], [179]. In a voluntary vaccination campaign, free riders are unvaccinated individuals who avoid infection because of herd immunity, as illustrated by the gray nodes in Fig. 4. To explore the impact of free-riding behavior, John et al. even organized a questionnaire containing six different hypothetical scenarios twenty years ago [180]. Under such a survey, altruism and free-riding were simultaneously considered as the potential decision motivations for vaccination. They found that, for vaccine conferring herd immunity, the free-riding frame causes less sensitivity to increase vaccination coverage than does the altruism frame, which means that free-riding lowers preference of vaccination when the proportion of others vaccinating increases. In addition to homogeneous groups of individuals, Yoko et al. recently conducted a computerized influenza experiment, where the groups of agents may face completely different conditions, such as infection risk, vaccine cost, severity of influenza and age structure [181]. They found that high vaccination rate of previous rounds certainly decreases the likelihood of individuals' vaccination acceptance in the following round, indicating the existence of free-riding behavior. Both empirical surveys thus showed that individuals' decision-making may be driven by the free-riding motive, which depresses vaccination coverage.",

Using the short text messages (tweets) data collected from Twitter between August 2009 and January 2010, during which pandemic influenza A (H1N1) spread globally, Salath\u00e9 et al. analyzed the spatiotemporal individuals' sentiments towards the novel influenza A (H1N1) vaccine [97]. They found that projected vaccination rates on the basis of sentiments of Twitter users can be in good accord with those estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of United States.

            "text": "We have reviewed some of the recent, rapidly expanding research literature concerning nonlinear coupling between disease dynamics and human behavioral dynamics in spatially distributed settings, especially complex networks. Generally speaking, these models show that emergent self-protective behavior can dampen an epidemic. This is also what most mean-field models predict. However, in many cases, that is where the commonality in model predictions ends. For populations distributed on a network, the structure of the disease contact network and/or social influence network can fundamentally alter the outcomes, such that different models make very different predictions depending on the assumptions about human population and diseases being studied, including findings that disease\u2013behavior interactions can actually worsen health outcomes by increasing long-term prevalence. Also, because network models are individual-based, they can represent processes that are difficult to represent with mean-field (homogeneous mixing) models. For example, the concept of the neighbor of an individual has a natural meaning in a network model, but the meaning is less clear in mean-field models (or partial differential equation models) where populations are described in terms of densities at a point in space. We speculate that the surge of research interest in this area has been fuelled by a combination of (1) the individual-based description that characterizes network models, (2) the explosion of available data at the individual level from digital sources, and (3) the realization from recent experiences with phenomena such as vaccine scares and quarantine failures that human behavior is becoming an increasingly important determinant of disease control efforts. We also discussed how many of the salient dynamics exhibited by disease\u2013behavior systems are directly analogous to processes in statistical physics, such as phase transitions and self-organization.",

            "text": "The growth in research has created both opportunities as well as pitfalls. A first potential pitfall is that coupled disease\u2013behavior models are significantly more complicated than simple disease dynamic or behavior dynamic models on their own. For a coupled disease\u2013behavior model, it is necessary not only to have a set of parameters describing the human behavioral dynamics and the disease dynamics separately, it is also possible to have a set of parameters to describe the impact of human behavior on disease dynamics, and another set to describe the effect of disease dynamics on human behavior. Thus, approximately speaking, these models have four times as many parameters as a disease dynamic model on its own, or a human behavioral model on its own: they are subject to the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. A second pitfall is that relevant research from other fields may not be understood or incorporated in the best possible way. For example, the concept of \u2018social contagion\u2019 appears repeatedly in the literature on coupled disease\u2013behavior models. This is a seductive concept, and it appears to be a natural concept for discussing systems where a disease contagion is also present. However, the metaphor may be too facile. For example, how can the social contagion metaphor capture the subtle but important distinction between descriptive social norms (where individuals follow a morally neutral perception of what others are doing) and injunctive social norms (where individuals follow a morally-laden perception of what others are doing) [184]? Social contagion may be a useful concept, but we should remember that it ultimately is only a metaphor. A third pitfall is lack of integration between theoretical models and empirical data: this pitfall is common to all mathematical modeling exercises. The second and third pitfalls are an unsurprising consequence of combining natural and human system dynamics in the same framework. There are other potential pitfalls as well.",

For systems that are too complicated for pen-and-paper methods, then methods for visualization of large and multidimensional datasets may prove useful. The second and third pitfalls, where physicists and other modelers, behavioral scientists and epidemiologists do not properly understand one another's fields can be mitigated through more opportunities for interaction between the fields through workshops, seminars and colloquia. Interactions between scholars in these fields if often stymied by institutional barriers that emphasize a \u2018silo\u2019 approach to academic, thus, a change in institutional modes of operation could be instrumental in improving collaborations between modelers, behavioral scientists and epidemiologists.",
