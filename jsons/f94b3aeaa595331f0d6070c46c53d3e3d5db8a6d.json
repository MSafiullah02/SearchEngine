Furthermore, just as LRT infections and higher viral load among fatal cases may increase the probability of direct secondary infections, such clinical manifestations may also increase the probability of indirect transmission. Thus, under the assumption that the statistical results from Analysis 1 are applicable to other nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-coronavirus, contact tracing should be prioritized for cases that fail to recover (post-mortem), as well as for cases that have a high risk of mortality, such as the comorbid and the elderly. 34, 35 While human-to-human transmission contributed substantially to nosocomial amplification during the 2015 South Korean MERS outbreak, it is possible that environmental contaminationas noted above-played a role as well. The relevant literature suggests that fomite and indoor ventilation system transmission may be the mechanism through which environmental contamination potentially amplifies disease transmission in hospital settings (Table 4 ). Although fomite transmission of viral pathogens is notoriously challenging to eliminate (e.g., via sanitization), simulation studies involving computational fluid dynamics suggest that low-cost solutions for the mitigation of indoor ventilation system transmission may exist. 36, 37 Unfortunately, such simulations remain limited in terms of use for recommendations due to lack of calibration and excessive utilization of free parameters, as well as notable absences of physical modeling for critical small-scale processes, such as mixing and pathogen re-suspension among others. However, recent validation studies -which have directly measured the role of violent respiratory events (e.g., sneezing and coughing) on indoor environmental contamination-show a new path ahead where pathogen loads, transport and mixing from a range of patient types can be addressed. 19, 20, 31 Moving forward, such studies will likely be integral to the development and effective deployment of more robust solutions for low cost redesign of indoor ventilation systems and patient-specific pathogen containment strategies, Translatability of these findings to Saudi Arabia, where MERScoronavirus is endemic and causes frequent nosocomial outbreaks, requires deeper consideration given the additional complexity posed by the prevalence of zoonotic transmissions from dromedary camels to humans, as well as the occurrence of household and community spread.

For example, MERS cases that failed to recover may have received more visitors on average due to the severity of their illness or been more likely to undergo aerosolizing procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy) in advanced stages of illness than those who recovered. Forthcoming work will explore these factors-namely, length of stay, visitor volume and virus dissemination (including aerosolizing procedures)-and their impact on nosocomial amplification of MERS-coronavirus in the future.
