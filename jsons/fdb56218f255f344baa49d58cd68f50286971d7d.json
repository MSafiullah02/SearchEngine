This study explored the epidemiological characteristics and molecular evolution of HBoV-1 in southeastern China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infections. HBoV-1 was detected using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and further characterized by complete genome sequences analysis. Among the 3,022 recruited children, 386 (12.77 %) were HBoV-1-positive and 300 (77.72 %) had co-detection with other respiratory viruses. Seasonal prevalence peaked in summer. HBoV-1 presence was significantly associated with asthma attack [odds ratio = 1.74; 95 % confidence interval: 1.30, 2.31; p<0.001]. Similar results were obtained when either single detection or co-detection of HBoV-1 was considered, demonstrating the minor impact of co-detection on the clinical characteristics or epidemic pattern.",

Selective pressure analysis showed that all the \u03c9-values were less than 1, suggesting that HBoV-1 was under negative selective pressure. Site-by-site analysis identified the codon site 40 of the VP1 gene under positive selection. In conclusion, our study disclosed the epidemiological and genetic dynamics of HBoV-1 epidemics in southeastern China in the most recent 3 years, the information of which might help to further improve our understanding of HBoV-1 infection and guide better surveillance and control strategies in the future.",

The sites were confirmed when they were selected by more than two methods. A single breakpoint recombination (SBP) test with both Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) calculation was conducted. The overall \u03c9-value and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were estimated based on NJ trees. Selective pressure was defined as neutral evolution with \u03c9=1, purifying or negative selection with \u03c9<1, and positive selection with \u03c9>1. A p-value of less than 0.10 was considered as the threshold for strong evidence of selection in SLAC, FEL, and IFEL, and posterior probability \u22650.9 in FUBAR, respectively. Statistical analysis was done by the Chi-square test for categorical variables. Logistic regression models were used to explore the factors associated with higher HBoV-1 detection and to determine the association between clinical characteristics and HBoV-1 infection, with clinical disease as the dependent variable and HBoV-1 infection as the independent variable. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95 % CIs were estimated using maximum likelihood methods. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05. All the tests were performed by using SAS 9.13 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).",

The monthly positive rates of HBoV-1 displayed specific seasonal distribution, as plotted in Fig. 1 . One seasonal peak was observed in summer, demonstrated by remarkably higher infection rates during May-August. An exception was noticed in 2010, when another low peak was also observed in the winter season from November to December. When the HBoV-1 single infection was plotted, a similar seasonal pattern was derived, with a clearly increased activity of HBoV demonstrated in summer.",

Vallet et al. found a high concordance between HBoV-1 detection and exacerbation of asthma requiring eventual hospitalization [27] . In our study, HBoV-1 detection was not associated with pneumonia. Instead, HBoV-1 tended to cause more upper respiratory tract infections, and its infection was also related with asthma exacerbation.

Analysis of the genomic and epidemiological data of HBoV-1 from the current study, as well as those available from different localities, revealed limited heterogeneity, and high conservation was demonstrated from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Zehender et al. reported that the estimated mean evolutionary rate of the HBoV-1 VP2 gene was 8.6\u00d710 \u22124 s/s/y using 48 non-recombinant isolates [28] , demonstrating that HBoV-1 was characterized by a rapid evolution. The rate identified in the current study is slower, which might be partially caused by the sample size of analyzed HBoV-1 sequences. A few of the previous studies explored the estimated evolutionary rates of parvoviruses in carnivore parvoviruses (7.9\u00d710 \u22125 -1.7\u00d710 \u22124 s/s/y) [29] and human parvovirus B19 (1.1\u00d710 \u22124 -2.6\u00d710 \u22124 s/s/y) [30] . The estimated mean evolutionary rates of the complete genome, VP1, VP2, and NS genes of HBoV-1 were similar to those of carnivore parvoviruses and human parvovirus B19. The NS gene was highly conservative among the four genes. Surprisingly, the NP gene showed a slightly higher substitution rate than the other genes.",

For HBoV-1, VP1 and VP2 have the same sequence of 542 aa at the C termini, while VP1 has an additional 129 aa peptide at the N-terminus. One study indicated that the VP1U of HBoV-1 also had sPLA2-like enzymatic activity, and these residues are crucial for its sPLA2-like activity [32] . Mutation of one of the amino acids (21Pro, 41His, 42Asp, or 63Asp) in the VP1U almost eliminated the sPLA2 activity of the HBoV-1 VP1U. Interestingly enough, one positive selection site (codon 40) was identified near codon 41 and 42 in the current study, which indicated a high probability of VP1U undergoing selective pressure. In spite of this finding, the associations between the positive selection site and sPLA2 activity or amplification of DNA need further investigation.",

The disclosure of the temporal pattern of HBoV infection provided the season when HBoV infection could be highly suspected and surveillance should be strengthened. The current data also demonstrated that HBoV was co-detected with a high prevalence; therefore, the sole presence of HBoV in patients should be interpreted carefully as to its causal role in causing disease. This information might help to further improve our understanding of HBoV-1 infection and guide better surveillance and control strategies in the future, especially among children.",

When compared with the >25 months group, the ORs for HBoV-1positive detection were 1.92 (95 % CI: 1.32, 2.80) for the 7-12 months group and 2.57 (95 % CI: 1.75, 3.76) for the 13-24 months group after adjustment for the confounding factors. The HBoV-1 detection rate was significantly higher in children having asthma attack (OR = 1.74; 95 % CI: 1.30, 2.31). Among the 386 children with positive results, 86 (22.28 %) had single HBoV-1 detection and the remaining 300 (77.72 %) were co-detected with other viruses, including human rhinovirus, enterovirus, human adenovirus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, and coronaviruses. The most frequently presented co-detection occurred between HBoV-1 with parainfluenza virus (30.05 %), followed by with RSV (28.50 %) and influenza virus (26.17 %). The patients with single detection had a median age of 11 months (range 1 months to 13 years) and 265 (68.65 %) were boys, which were comparable with the subjects with HBoV-1 detection as a whole. The patients with HBoV-1 detection presented clinical manifestations of cough (291, 97.00 %), sputum (226, 75.33 %), and diarrhea (91, 30.33 %). These syndromes were presented with highly comparable frequencies among patients with HBoV-1 single detection [cough (83, 96.51 %), sputum (63, 73.26 %), and diarrhea (26, 30.23 %)].
