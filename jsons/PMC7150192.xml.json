            "text": "Inulin is a plant-based polysaccharide composed of \u03b2(2\u21921) polyfructofuranosyl \u03b1-d-glucose polymer chains in which a linear chain of fructose rings is terminated by a glucose ring (Fig. 10.1A\n). Plants of the Compositae family (dahlias, chicory, artichoke, onions, garlic) produce inulin as a storage carbohydrate (reviewed in1). Inulin's medicinal uses date back to ancient times; as early as AD 100 Pedanios Dioscoride, a Roman army physician, identified the beneficial effects of chicory root extract (\u223c40% inulin by weight) for the treatment of stomach, liver, and kidney complaints.2 In 1804, inulin was purified from a boiling water extract of Inula helenium\n3 leading to its current name.4 The beneficial effects of inulin were rediscovered in 1874 when it was shown diabetic patients put on a daily diet of 100 g of inulin lost their glycosuria.3 Dietary inulin has been shown to reduce fasting insulin, triacylglycerol,5 hepatic lipogenesis,6 and atherosclerotic lesions7; as well as enhance expression of histone deacetylases; and induce apoptosis of colon cancer cells.8 It also has antiinflammatory effects and has been shown to suppress autoimmune disease.9 The inability of mammals to metabolize inulin led in the 1920s to its use for the measurement of glomerular filtration, confirming its exceptional safety including in pregnant women and newborn babies.10 Injection of inulin has no adverse effects other than a mild osmotic diuresis.11 Some patients injected with inulin developed transient hypotensive symptoms, found to reflect complement activation, a finding that led to the discovery of the alternative complement pathway (ACP).12 The ability of crystalline (gamma) inulin to activate the ACP was initially exploited as an anticancer treatment.13, 14, 15, 16, 17 However, the connection between complement activation and adaptive immunity promted the testing inulin particles for their ability to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. Inulin particles turned out to have surprisingly potent immune modulatory properties, an attribute not shared by soluble inulin. This led to development of delta inulin (Advax) as a highly stable well-defined microcrystalline inulin particle (Fig. 10.1B) with potent vaccine adjuvant action, as described below.",

Adult subjects received three intramuscular doses of a commercial HBsAg vaccine antigen supplied by Butantan Institute, alone or formulated with Advax adjuvant.26 Advax significantly increased antibody levels and anti-HBsAg CD4+ T-cell responses. By comparison, the majority of subjects immunized with antigen alone did not achieve seroprotection or measurable T-cell responses after three immunizations. Advax was well tolerated with no significant differences in injection site pain scores or adverse events when compared to injection of HBsAg alone.",

Addition of Advax adjuvant to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluvax, CSL Australia) or a monovalent inactivated H1N1 influenza virus antigen (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) enhanced neutralizing antibody titers and provided up to 100-fold antigen sparing in mice.27 This correlated with a higher frequency of IgM- and IgG-secreting memory B cells in the bone marrow and spleen. Advax increased influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferative responses and IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, and GM-CSF production, and this translated into enhanced protection against a lethal influenza challenge. The effect of Advax on immune memory was long lived with elevated antibody titers, T-cell responses, and protection still evident 1 year postimmunization.27 Injection of mice with Advax alone in absence of antigen provided no protection against influenza infection, indicating Advax, unlike Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, does not activate nonspecific innate immune pathways. Advax was also tested for its ability to help overcome the negative effects of pregnancy on influenza vaccine responses. Pregnant dams immunized intramuscularly with a single dose of inactivated influenza antigen with Advax had higher serum antiinfluenza IgG titers and this translated into higher influenza-specific IgG titers in their breast milk and higher IgG titers in the serum of their suckling pups, which were completely protected when challenged with a lethal influenza challenge at 4 weeks of age.28 Advax was well tolerated by the pregnant dams and no adverse effects were observed on mothers or their pups. Other adjuvants, namely, alum29 and MF59 squalene emulsion30 failed to protect neonates, even when given as a two-dose vaccine regimen at 7 and 21 days of age. The ability of Advax to enhance influenza vaccine protection was therefore tested in 7-day-old pups. Immunization of 7-day-old pups with a single dose of influenza antigen with Advax increased serum IgM and IgG1 levels, memory B and T cell frequency, and protected against influenza challenge at 28 days of age.31 Remarkably, given that neonatal T cells have been described to have a fixed defect in the ability to make IFN-\u03b3 irrespective of stimulus,32 Advax restored the ability of neonatal T cells to make IFN-\u03b3 recall responses. The benefits of Advax are not just restricted to seasonal influenza vaccines as in a ferret H5N1 challenge model, Advax enhanced protection against high-pathogenicity H5N1 avian influenza.33 Reduced clinical disease, absence of brain invasion, faster virus clearance, and complete survival were seen in the Advax-adjuvanted groups.",

Hence, these adjuvants all induce activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB and an inflammatory response.51 Advax does not induce inflammatory cytokine production, thereby distinguishing it from other adjuvants. Although its mechanism of action remains the subject of intense ongoing study, it is hypothesized to work by modulating antigen-presenting cell function in a noninflammatory manner, thereby enhancing the costimulation and activation of antigen-specific helper T cells that in turn license the expansion of memory B cells and CD8 T cells. In human subjects receiving seasonal influenza vaccine Advax enhanced the day 7 plasmablast response, and enhanced influenza-specific B-cell affinity maturation, as reflected by a higher rate of nonsilent mutations in the B-cell receptor CDR3 region.

These studies have all confirmed the lack of significant local and systemic reactogenicity of Advax-adjuvanted vaccines. Histology of the injection site in these studies revealed a collection of macrophages and neutrophils, as typically seen with vaccine injections, but without any muscle necrosis or overlying skin swelling or heat to suggest overt inflammation. Similarly, even when given at high doses Advax did not induce pyrexia, and there were minimal changes to acute-phase reactants, serum inflammatory markers, and hematological or biochemical parameters in response to Advax administration. Although typical pharmacokinetic studies are not required for licensing of vaccines, long-term tissue residence of adjuvants such as alum and oil emulsions has been suggested to contribute to potential toxicity. Studies undertaken into the biodistribution and excretion of parenterally administered Advax have shown that it is rapidly excreted through the urine. Hence, the majority of an intramuscular injection of Advax in mice was shown to be cleared through the urine within 7 days.",

It is effective in a broad range of animal species and is safe and well tolerated when administered during pregnancy and early neonatal life. It acts synergistically with traditional innate immune activators such as murabutide or CpG oligonucleotides. Positive results in preclinical studies have translated into successful human clinical trials, which have confirmed its exceptional safety, tolerability, and efficacy.\n",

When formulated with SARS coronavirus vaccine, Advax reduced the risk of lung eosinophilic immunopathology, suggesting that it may be beneficial for use in respiratory virus vaccines, e.g., against SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and respiratory syncytial virus, where the risk of vaccine-enhanced lung immunopathology is a major concern. Advax's ability to enhance both humoral and cellular immunity makes it particularly suited for use in antiviral vaccines, given the important role of T cells in clearing viral infections. Its ability to induce high numbers of antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells also makes Advax well suited for use in vaccines against intracellular pathogens, such as Listeria or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other areas of promise are use in allergy vaccines to accelerate desensitization, and in vaccines against chronic viral infections where T-cells are needed for control of viral replication.",
