            "text": "CSF collection is contraindicated when the CNS signs are associated with known trauma or intoxication (Parent and Rand, 1994), when anesthesia is contraindicated (Carmichael, 1998, Cook and DeNicola, 1988), and when increased intracranial pressure is suspected. Increased intracranial pressure should be suspected with acute head trauma, active or decompensated hydrocephalus, anisocoria, papilledema, or cerebral edema. Expansile mass lesions and unstable CNS or systemic conditions may result in increased intracranial pressure or decreased pressure in the spinal compartment relative to the intracranial compartment. In these situations, herniation of the brain may result in severe compromise of brain function, tetraplegia, stupor/coma, and/or death (Parent and Rand, 1994). The history, physical and neurologic examinations, and results of imaging studies are critical in determining if these conditions are likely before deciding to collect CSF. Should the benefit of obtaining CSF outweigh the risk, the risk of herniation can be reduced by administration of dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg IV) just before induction of anesthesia and by hyperventilation of the patient with oxygen during the procedure (Fenner, 2000). Except in cases in which dexamethasone is administered prophylactically because of suspected increased intracranial pressure, CSF collection should predate corticosteroid administration because of potential alteration of CSF composition (Rand, 1995).",

CSF collection from the lumbar cistern is more difficult and more likely to be contaminated with blood than that from the cerebellomedullary cistern (Chrisman, 1992). Sometimes no fluid or only a very small amount of fluid is obtained owing to the small size of the lumbar subarachnoid space. Lumbar puncture may be preferred in cases with localized spinal disease because it may be more likely to confirm abnormality than cerebellomedullary cistern collections (Thomson et al., 1990).",

            "text": "Cells lyse rapidly in the low-protein milieu of CSF, so cell counts and cytologic preparations of unfixed fluid should be done within 30 to 60 minutes of collection (Fry et al., 2006). The likelihood of misinterpretation due to sample deterioration depends on the initial protein concentration of the sample and how long the analysis is delayed. For example, if the CSF protein concentration is more than 50 mg/dL, a delay in analysis of less than 12 hours is unlikely to alter final interpretation. Addition of an equal volume of 4% to 10% neutral buffered formalin or 50% to 90% alcohol, depending on availability, is recommended for fixation of specimens that cannot be immediately delivered to a laboratory and processed immediately (Carmichael, 1998). Alternatively, the addition of one drop of 10% formalin to 1 to 2 mL of CSF can be used to preserve cells for cell counts and morphologic examination when submitted to a referral laboratory; cell count will be different from unfixed, but the difference is clinically insignificant. Refrigeration will help retard cellular degeneration. Cellular stability can be increased by addition of fresh, frozen, or thawed serum or plasma (Bienzle et al., 2000) or by addition of 20% albumin (Fenner, 2000). If a CSF sample is not analyzed within 1 hour from collection, Fry et al (2006) recommend dividing the fluid into two aliquots, an unadulterated aliquot for total nucleated cell count (TNCC) and protein measurement and an aliquot added with 20% of fetal calf serum (or 10% autologous serum) for differential cell count and morphologic evaluation. For those samples of insufficient volume (less than 0.5 mL total), hetastarch can be added to CSF for routine assays. In the last situation, the dilutional effect of adding a stabilizing agent must be taken into account when calculating results. Hetastarch comes ready to use as 6% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.9% NaCl solution and is then added to CSF 1:1 (vol/vol). Protein and enzyme concentrations in CSF are relatively stable during transit by routine pick-up, overnight postal, and courier delivery (Carmichael, 1998). Analyses other than cell counts and cell differentials are best performed on the unadulterated aliquot to ensure no interference.",

Refractometer total protein evaluation is not accurate for assessment of CSF since the concentration of protein is quite low compared to serum or plasma and clinically significant changes may not be easily detectable on the refractometer scale. Special analytic techniques most often available at commercial or reference laboratories and not available in practice are needed owing to the minute protein concentration in CSF. Due to the minute amounts present, CSF protein analysis may be referred to as \u201cmicroprotein.\u201d An estimate of CSF protein content can be obtained using urine dipsticks.

The ratio between blood glucose and CSF glucose is frequently reduced in bacterial infections of the CNS in humans and has been reported to occur in some cases of pyogenic infections of the CNS, CSF hemorrhage, or blood contamination that may result in increased utilization of glucose by cells. However, the relationship between bacterial encephalitis and decreased CSF glucose compared with serum or plasma glucose may depend on multiple factors, including the blood glucose level, degree of permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and presence or absence of glycolytic cells or microorganisms. Fenner (2000) stated that the reduction in glucose does not occur in dogs. Significant reductions in CSF glucose concentrations have been reported in human malignant disorders involving the leptomeninges, and it is considered a relatively specific finding for this condition (Chamberlain, 1995).",

Evaluation of multiple preparations or preparations from larger volumes of CSF increases the likelihood of detection of minor abnormalities. Because CSF has low cellularity, a concentration procedure is generally required: cytocentrifugation, sedimentation, or membrane filtration techniques may be used. Cytocentrifugation is commonly available in reference or commercial laboratories. The membrane filtration technique requires special staining that is not commonly available in practice. Several sedimentation techniques have been described and are suitable for use in practice or commercial or reference laboratories to which rapid submission of CSF specimens is possible (Cook and DeNicola, 1988, Parent and Rand, 1994). Readers are referred to these sources for more detail on construction of a sedimentation apparatus and preparation of sedimentation specimens. A sample device is demonstrated in Fig. 14-2A&B\n. Sedimentation preparations may be made if a specimen cannot be delivered the same day to the laboratory for cytologic processing. Prepared slides are sent to the laboratory for staining and evaluation.",

Leptomeningeal (subarachnoid lining) cells are described as individual or small clusters of mononuclear cells with moderate to abundant lightly basophilic cytoplasm containing round to oval eccentric nuclei with a delicate chromatin pattern.

Parasites such as Toxocara canis, Dirofilaria immitis, Cuterebra larva, or Cysticercus that may cause neurologic disease have not been reported in CSF cytology preparations. The presence of marked neutrophilic pleocytosis or increasing numbers of neutrophils in sequential CSF collections has been reported to be an unfavorable prognostic finding. Neoplasia should be considered as the most likely diagnosis in a cat more than 7 years of age with progressive clinical neurologic signs of greater than 4 weeks\u2019 duration (Rand et al., 1994).",

The main neurologic signs are depression, tetraparesis, head tilt, nystagmus, and intention tremor (Baroni and Heinold, 1995). It accounted for 44% of 61 feline cases of inflammatory CNS disease (Rand et al., 1994). Parent and Rand (1994) indicated that marked neutrophilic pleocytosis with TNCC of more than 100 cells/\u03bcL and neutrophils greater than 50% is commonly seen with FIP, along with increased CSF protein (usually greater than 200 mg/dL). They indicated a high probability of FIP if a cat is less than 4 years of age and shows multifocal neurologic signs referable to the cerebellum and/or brainstem, protracted course of illness, and CSF protein greater than 200 mg/dL. Later in the course of the disease, a mixed cellular population may be found with large mononuclear cells and lymphocytes present to a significant degree (Fig. 14-7A&B\n). Similar results were found by Singh and others (2005) in a series of 11 cats with FIP. CSF analysis in that study was characterized as suppurative in seven cats, mixed in one, and mononuclear in three. Five cats had marked elevations in the CSF WBC count (more than 1000 cells/\u03bcL), three had moderate elevations (51 to 1000 calls/ \u03bcL), two had mild elevations (6 to 50 cells/\u03bcL), and one had insufficient sample for a WBC count.",

Bacteria are not observed or cultured and improvement is often seen within 72 hours following glucocorticoid administration; long-term prognosis is good. One report investigated the immunologic response in these cases finding IgG and IgA synthesis intrathecally and suggested the humoral response is primary rather than the result of a generalized immune complex disease (Tipold et al., 1995). In another more recent paper, Behr and Cauzinille (2006) evaluated clinical findings and prognosis in a series of 12 cases of aseptic suppurative meningitis in juvenile Boxers, of which 10 of the dogs exhibited the acute form of the disease and had TNCC of more than 100 cells/\u03bcL, with neutrophils ranging from 72% to 100%. The two other dogs presented with a more chronic form that produced a mixed pleocytosis, with neutrophils about 60% of total nucleated cells. An abnormal cell count of mixed cell population or mononuclear cells in CSF are seen in the protracted form, and monitoring of CSF cell count in dogs with this condition seems to be a sensitive indicator of success of treatment (Cizinauskas et al., 2000).",

However, monocytoid/macrophage cells may also predominate in these conditions and most commonly with cryptococcosis (Figure 14-12, Figure 14-13\n). Mononuclear pleocytosis was noted in two cats with cuterebriasis (Glass et al., 1998) and in another cat with cerebral cholesterol granuloma (Fluhemann et al., 2006). The appearance of CSF macrophages containing vacuoles and pink-purple amorphous granular material in a young cat with mononuclear pleocytosis, elevated protein content, seizures, incoordination, and tremors indicated the presence of a lysosomal storage disease (GM2-gangliosidosis) (Johnsrude et al., 1996). A young Miniature Poodle with necrotizing meningoencephalitis had pleocytosis with primary large granular lymphocytes (Garma-Avi\u00f1a and Tyler, 1999). The most frequent noninflammatory neurologic diseases of CNS in the cat are neoplasia and ischemic encephalopathy, which usually present with an elevated CSF protein and slight lymphocytic pleocytosis or normal TNCC (Rand et al., 1994). Hemorrhagic conditions may be accompanied by a mononuclear pleocytosis composed of foamy macrophages (Fig. 14-14A&B\n).",

A study of 42 dogs found that a high percentage of affected animals were Toy or Terrier breeds (Munana and Luttgen, 1998). Clinical signs of fever, ataxia, tetraparesis, cervical hyperesthesia, and seizures have been reported. Designation of the clinical signs into focal or multifocal was helpful in determining prognosis, with dogs having focal clinical signs surviving longer. Lesions are histologically found in both white and gray matter of the brain and predominantly the white matter of the caudal brainstem and spinal cord. CSF has variable cytology ranging from a mild to moderate lymphocytic, mixed cell pleocytosis to neutrophilic predominance (Chrisman, 1992). Nucleated cell counts had a median of 250 cells/\u03bcL (range 0 to 11,840) with the majority having counts greater than 100 cells/\u03bcL (Munana and Luttgen, 1998). In this same study, dogs with multifocal signs all had pleocytosis, whereas some of the dogs with focal signs had normal cell counts. The predominant cell type was lymphocytic (52%), monocytic (21%), neutrophilic (10%), and mixed cell (17%). CSF protein is variably elevated, with a mean value of 256 mg/dL (range 13 to 1119), as reported by Bailey and Higgins (1986). Differential diagnoses include infectious diseases and idiopathic necrotizing encephalitis. Electrophoretic separation of CSF proteins in GME has shown increases in the alpha and beta globulin fractions (Sorjonen, 1990), whereas these fractions are generally decreased in canine distemper (Chrisman, 1992). Both GME and canine distemper may have increased gamma globulins. GME lesions involve widely disseminated perivascular, lymphocytic-granulomatous meningeal, and parenchymal infiltrates. Necrosis and demyelination are major features in necrotizing encephalitis and may be present to a minor extent in GME. GME cases with lesions that involve the caudal brainstem or spinal cord progress slowly, permitting longer survival. Radiation has been recommended as an adjunct to treatment, especially in dogs with focal clinical signs. The disease is poorly responsive to glucocorticoids despite the suggestion of an immune-mediated etiopathogenesis (Kipar et al., 1998). GME inflammatory lesions are composed of predominantly CD3 antigen\u2013positive T-lymphocytes and a heterogeneous population of activated macrophages with MHC class II expression, suggesting a T-cell\u2013mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity of an organ-specific autoimmune disease (Kipar et al., 1998).",

Cell counts may be variable, ranging from normal to greater than 50 cells/\u03bcL; and lymphocytes represent the predominant cell population, accounting for greater than 60% of the cells present. Abate et al (1998) indicated that CSF in distemper cases had increases in macrophages, total protein concentration, and gamma-globulin fraction by electrophoretic separation and the presence of cellular inclusions. Amude et al (2006) described a marked CSF pleocytosis (554 cells/\u03bcL) with protein content within normal limits in a 7-month-old dog with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed viral distemper. In this case, the nucleated cell differential count was 70% lymphocytes, 25% neutrophils, and 5% monocytes. Diagnosis of canine distemper often involves suggestive history, clinical signs, and evidence of serum or CSF IgM in response to active infection by canine distemper virus. In addition, RT-PCR on CSF is considered a useful, fast, and specific method to diagnose canine distemper virus infection (Amude et al., 2006).",

Spinal cord infarction with diffuse myelomalacia in a dog resulted in the presence of foamy macrophages in CSF (Mesher et al., 1996). Luxol fast blue staining of the amorphous eosinophilic material found within the macrophages was positive in this case, which was suggestive of myelin.

Myelin-like material was observed in 20 of 98 (20%) samples and was more frequently observed in lumbar than in cerebellomedullary samples. Samples from dogs less than 10 kg were more likely to contain myelin compared with dogs more than 10 kg. Larger amounts of myelin-like material were observed in CSF from dogs with intervertebral disc disease compared with other diseases. No association was found between myelin-like material and outcome. These results suggest that the presence of extracellular myelin-like material in canine CSF samples is more often an artifact of collection technique and anatomy rather than the result of neurologic disease; in addition, myelin-like material in CSF is not associated with a poorer prognosis.",

This will depend on the location of the mass with its proximity to the ventricle, its involvement with the meninges, or its communication with the subarachnoid space in order to have access to CSF. CSF was collected in 51 dogs with primary intracranial neoplasia, in which the fluid was normal in 10% of cases, characterized by an elevated cell count in 58% of cases, and characterized as albuminocytologic dissociation in 30% of cases. A mixed cell pleocytosis was the most common cytologic abnormality in the 51 samples, and cellular atypia or neoplastic cells were detected in only two dogs with CNS lymphoma (Snyder et al., 2006). The authors concluded that in the case of CNS lymphoma, CSF analysis may be helpful in achieving a diagnosis. Similarly, in 28 cats with intracranial neoplasia, Troxel et al (2003) found that albuminocytologic dissociation was noted in eight (28.6%) cats. The remaining 20 (71.4%) cats had varied increases in nucleated cell counts, while a definitive diagnosis of lymphoma was made in only one cat in which lymphoid blast cells were detected in CSF.",

The use of immunocytochemistry can assist to determine the immunophenotype of suspected lymphoma cases (Fig. 14-31A&B). Well-differentiated lymphoid malignancies may not be readily distinguished from a lymphocytic pleocytosis involving granular lymphocytes (Fig. 14-33A&B\n).

Medulloblastoma should be considered as another differential diagnosis for atypical round cells in CSF of young dogs (Thompson et al., 2003).

Intraoperative cytology has been successfully applied in veterinary medicine (Vernau et al., 2001) and compares well with histologic interpretation (De Lorenzi et al., 2006). Elective employment of smear cytology in neuropathology is based on several considerations: it is very simple and quick to perform, it requires few materials and equipment, and the specimens can be prepared directly in the operating or adjacent room. Small pieces of tissue can be examined and smears can be repeated several times with different portions of the same specimens. Various fast-staining techniques can be used. Smear preparations appear to be of greater diagnostic value, with fewer nondiagnostic specimens, when compared with touch preparations (Long et al., 2002). Moissonnier et al (2002) demonstrated that stereotactic CT-guided brain biopsy can be considered as a valued technique in the neurologic workup of patients with brain diseases, and that an early cytologic assessment is considered important even during conventional intracranial and spinal surgery.",

The tumors are derived from leptomeningocytes that associate with neural crest tissue and have both epithelial and fibroblastic ultrastructural characteristics. As a result, these tumors have several variant forms (Montoliu et al., 2006), which are found both in cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord as well as intracranially and within the retrobulbar region (Zimmerman et al., 2000). Spinal cord meningiomas are mostly extramedullary, but few reports note the radiographic presentation of them as intramedullary (Hopkins et al., 1995). According to Bailey and Higgins (1986), meningiomas are associated with a high prevalence of pleocytosis (nucleated cell counts greater than 50/\u03bcL), with a predominance of neutrophils that is attributed to a response to tumor necrosis. In contrast, pleocytosis was detected in only 27% of 56 dogs with intracranial meningioma, and a neutrophil predominance was observed in only 19% of dogs. It is possible that the incidence of the tumor necrosis was less in their study. Myelography, MRI, and CT are imaging tools used currently to identify tumors of the brain and spinal cord. Fine-needle aspirations, crush preparations (De Lorenzi et al., 2006, Moissonnier et al., 2002), and incisional cutting needles (Platt et al., 2002) have been used to obtain cytologic and tissue samples for biopsy.

Meningioma cells had round to slightly elongate, uniform-sized nuclei with a small, prominent nucleolus, diffusely coarse chromatin, and a well-defined nuclear border. Rarely, there were intranuclear cytoplasmic evaginations, but these were plentiful in some individual tumor cells of the meningothelial subtype (Fig. 14-46A\n). More elongated cells sometimes had a central bar or fold through the longitudinal axis of their nucleus. There were variable amounts of eosinophilic, granular, wispy to solid cytoplasm that appeared round to elongate, often with a polar location. Mitotic figures were extremely rare.

The ependymoma (Box 14-1) is a rare tumor (Fig. 14-57\n) that was reported in the cat, with neoplastic cells found in CSF with a moderately elevated protein content, mild pleocytosis, and macrophages as the predominant cell type along with evidence of chronic hemorrhage. The neoplastic cells were described as large cells having nuclear hyperchromatism, prominent nucleoli, and moderately abundant, highly basophilic agranular cytoplasm appearing singly and in clusters. An anaplastic ependymoma in a dog was diagnosed from partial positive staining with GFAP and vimentin but a negative reaction with S100, CD3, and cytokeratin (Fernandez et al., 1997). The choroid plexus cells represent a highly vascular portion of the pia mater that projects into the ventricles of the brain and is thought to secrete CSF. Positive cytokeratin staining is expected in choroid plexus tumors (Box 14-1). A cytologic example of a choroid plexus tumor is shown as an imprint of the tumor mass and within CSF (Fig. 14-58A&B\n). The choroid plexus tumors were associated with increased protein content and increased nucleated cell count in a study (Bailey and Higgins, 1986). These cells appear similar to mesothelial cells, having a large, round nucleus with abundant, well-defined, deeply basophilic cytoplasm having surface projections (Fig. 14-58C). A papillary appearance with epithelial features can be seen in cytologic preparations of choroid plexus papilloma (Fig. 14-58A). Two choroid plexus carcinomas were cytologically misdiagnosed as choroid plexus papillomas (De Lorenzi et al., 2006). Both of these tumors occurred within a ventricular site and consisted of large, pedunculated, friable masses that presented cytologically as well-formed papillary structures, usually showing a fine fibrovascular core covered by uniform cuboidal or columnar epithelium having minimal cytologic atypia with moderate pleomorphism (Fig. 14-59A\n). The final histologic diagnosis of carcinoma was made based on the presence of single-cell infiltration into the fibrovascular cores, suggesting that a definitive diagnosis of choroid plexus carcinoma can be made only after thorough histologic examination of the resected specimen (Fig. 14-59B). Magnetic resonance imaging and CSF analysis were helpful in determining a difference between choroid plexus papilloma and choroid plexus carcinoma (Westworth et al., 2008). In this study, Golden Retrievers were overrepresented compared with the hospital population and median CSF protein concentration in carcinomas was 108 mg/dL (range 27\u2013380 mg/dL) that was significantly higher compared to papillomas whose median was 34 mg/dL (range 32\u201380 mg/dL).",

During the last decade, there has been an increased use of sophisticated imaging techniques with increased surgical investigation and surgical and medical treatment of neurologic disease. These trends indicate there may be opportunity to expand the use of nervous system cytology to include examination of fine-needle aspirates of lesions identified within the brain or spinal cord, ventricular fluids obtained by direct aspiration or by cannula, and squash preparations of small biopsy specimens or tissue fragments. All of these techniques are currently used in cytologic evaluations of human patients (Bigner, 1997) and to a limited extent in veterinary medicine (De Lorenzi et al., 2006, Moissonnier et al., 2002, Vernau et al., 2001). There may be increased demand and/or need for development of special preparative techniques such as cell blocks and immunocytochemistry for more precise identification of primary or metastatic tumors, inflammatory cell types, or immunophenotype of malignant or nonmalignant lymphoid proliferations. This is useful in human medicine for the purpose of diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring.",

This intradural spinal mass is composed of large cells with a histiocytic appearance having an eccentrically placed nucleus and abundant pink, granular cytoplasm. Also present is a normal-appearing mitotic figure. A positive immunohistochemical stain for glial fibrillary acid protein was determined, which confirmed the astrocytic origin. (MGG; HP oil.)
