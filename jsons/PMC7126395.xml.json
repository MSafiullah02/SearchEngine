It has been shown that analyzing microarray data is a challenging task due to its high-dimensionality and small-sample nature. The most popular way to utilize the array data is to identifying biomarkers for specific diseases [3], [5], [6], [8] or building classification models [4], [7], [8]. These conventional approaches only target for achieving highly differentiated biomarkers or signatures, thus the relationships among biomarkers are not of their concern. Biomarker can vary drastically in different circumstances, suggesting it is risky to rely on individual biomarkers without knowing its regulations in between.",

[11] applied Bayesian networks to analyze gene regulations with a probabilistic manner; Curtis and Brand proposed a modular regulation analysis method [14]; Yeung et al. presented the dominant spectral component technique for discovering transcriptional regulations [15]. Some researches devoted to exploring molecular interactions for classification purpose. For instance, Qiu et al. proposed an ensemble dependence model-to-model linear dependence relationships among gene clustering centers [12]. In particular, Antonov et al. believed that molecular patterns vary in different patient groups, and proposed to extract regulatory relationships by using linear programming methods [13]. As a result, by adopting a weighted sum of the logarithms of the expression levels, the authors proposed a classification model based on regulation information. One disadvantage of aforementioned methods is that the regulation relationship is constructed for all groups, thus no unique feature can be extracted for individual patient group [16].",

In this paper, we propose to construct a regulatory network (RN) to model the biological regulations. In brief, a RN is constructed to be a hopfield-like network with nodes representing biomarkers and directional connections to be regulations in between. The input to the network is the measured expression levels of biomarkers, and the output is the summation of regulatory strengths from other biomarkers. An energy function is defined as the measure of the disagreement between the input and output of the network. Minimizing the energy function can thus reconstruct the regulatory relationships among biomarkers. Since RN can extract unique features of each disease condition, one immediate application of RN is to classify different diseases. To simulate more complicated regulations, a sigmoid kernel function is imposed on each node to construct a non-linear regulatory network (NRN), which will be shown can enjoy higher stability and accuracy in disease classification.",

Unlike genome, which is relatively constant and simple, proteome is much more complicated due to its extensive interactions with other molecules and environmental conditions. For instance, many proteins only function in the presence of other molecules, and some proteins may cooperatively form complexes that could be involved in the translational modification of other proteins. Proteinchip of SELDI-TOF-MS (surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) is a high-throughput technique that can simultaneously interrogate thousands of proteins, thus providing abundant information of protein expressions in an organism. Two datasets have been used as test beds, one dataset includes patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with different responses to chemotherapy drug, and the other consists of patients of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, and control normals. The regulatory networks among protein biomarkers were reconstructed for different disease conditions in each dataset. We demonstrated our methods have better classification capability when comparing with conventional methods including Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), K-nearest neighborhood (KNN), linear support vector machines (linSVM) and radial basis function based support vector machines (rbfSVM)).",

For example, interaction coefficients between protein M7993_48 and M2193_50 in RS group are 0.26 and 0.32, suggesting mutual promotion between the two proteins. However, the regulatory strengths become negative, suggesting mutual repression between them. Moreover, in the network of RS group, the mutual regulations between M7993_48 and M9209_62 are very weak (0.035, 0.025), but the regulation from protein M9209_62 to M7993_48 becomes very strong (12.15). Furthermore, both of the NRNs have different dominant biomarkers with greater regulatory coefficients than any others, as marked in the hexagon nodes in Fig. 5(A) and (B). Such dominant biomarkers may dominate the networks associated with cancer and are the hub biomarkers of the networks, which play a crucial role in cancer development [24]. The biomarkers having smaller regulatory coefficients than others are marked in the smaller circle nodes in Fig. 5(A) and (B), which may locate at the far end of the cancer regulation pathway.

Best protein combinations were sought through searching the panel with cross-validation training RN and NRN on the training data. Fig. 7\nshows the classification performances with different number of biomarkers (p). It can be seen that both for RN and NRN, the testing accuracies increased when more proteins were involved and similar trend on LOOCV accuracies. This again confirmed that the regulatory network approach can perform very robustly with excellent generalization power. The best test accuracy of 89% was achieved by NRN when 5 proteins were involved. Fig. 8\nillustrates the expression range of the 5 proteins, in which it can be seen that C03278_7 and C08131_5 highly expressed for SARS group, C08989_3 and C08954_7 highly expressed for IFZ group, and all the proteins down-regulated for control normals.",

It can be found that the connection metrics of the three networks are remarkably different, suggesting the regulation patterns change in the three patient groups. For example, the regulations between C08989_3 and C3278_7 are weak in SARS (\u22120.10, \u22120.12) and normal (0.09, 0.14), while in IFZ group, the repression strength from C3278_7 to C08989_3 becomes very strong. Also in SARS group, regulatory coefficients between protein C05909_7 and C08989_3 are 0.23 and 0.30, suggesting mutual promotion between the two proteins; while in normal and IFZ groups, their regulatory coefficients become negative, suggesting mutual repression in between. Similar to the analysis on the NPC data, the dominant and minor biomarkers of the regulatory network of each patient group are marked in hexagon and smaller circle nodes respectively. It is observed that the three NRNs have different dominant and minor biomarkers. In summary, the obtained NRNs can remarkably discriminate the three groups from the aspect of protein regulations.",

            "text": "From the above two applications, it can be seen that the non-linear regulatory network performs better than its linear version. Hence we believe that the non-linear transformation in the NRN classifiers plays a crucial role in improving the performance. The sigmoid coefficient \u03b2 is an important parameter of the sigmoid function, which controls the non-linear transformation and can improve the separability of the original data by reducing noise. To investigate the impact of this coefficient, we check the classification performance of the NRN classifier under different values of \u03b2 on the NPC dataset. As a result, it is observed that even when the coefficient is fixed in range of [0.00, 10.1], similar classification performances can still be obtained, which shows NRN is not sensitive to the sigmoid parameter. We then check the optimized non-linear regulatory coefficients for the NR and RS groups with different values of \u03b2. Fig. 11\nshows the Pearson relation values between obtained regulatory matrices for the two groups under the setting of \u03b2\n = {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5}, of which subfigure (A) is for NR, (B) is for RS, and (C) is between NR and RS. In these subfigures, the different colors represent different Pearson relation values, as shown in the color bar (right panel) (For interpretation of the references to colour in the text, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.). From Fig. 11(A) and (B), it can be found that for the same patient group, the relation values between the regulatory matrices obtained for different values of \u03b2 are very high (>0.8), while those for different groups are very low (<0.4), as shown in subfigure (C). To check more details, we further compute the deviations of the five regulatory coefficient values of a protein relation. Fig. 12\nshows the probability distribution of the deviations for each patient group, indicating that the deviations approach zero. The results suggest that our proposed regulatory network approach can obtain the stable and reliable regulatory relationships as long as the sigmoid parameter is properly set.",

In general, sensitivity is considered to be capable of reflecting how good a test is at picking out patients with a disease, and specificity refers to the ability of the test to pick out patients who do not have the disease. As an example, for the NPC dataset, we set the nonresponder group as the positive class and responder group to be negative. For SARS dataset, we take one class as the positive class and the left two classes as negative in turn to make evaluation. As a result, the sensitivities and specificities of our NRN classifiers and the three methods, KNN, linSVM and rbfSVM, are shown in Table 1\n. It can be found that all sensitivity and specificity values of our NRN classifier are higher than 80%, which are better than those of the three previous approaches. It is also observed that irrespective the NPC dataset or the SARS dataset, the NRN classifier has less variation between sensitivity and specificity than any of the three previous approaches. This advantage should be due to the capsulation of the optimized regulatory networks for each group in the NRN classifier.",

The derived networks can effectively capture the unique regulatory patterns of protein markers associated with different patient groups and hence can be used for disease classification. In the experimental section, the proposed regulatory networks have been validated on two real-world protein profiling dataset, NPC and SARS. The comparisons of our method and the conventional methods, including FLD, KNN, linSVM and rbfSVM have been made as well. Experimental results showed the effectiveness and efficiency of our networks in capturing the regulatory patterns of various diseases as well as the excellent discriminative power. In contrast to conventional methods, the proposed approach can characterize complex regulation relationships and perform disease classification in an accurate manner. The regulatory patterns of disease classes were encapsulated in the regulatory coefficients of the RNs. From a biological viewpoint, the positive coefficients represent up-regulation which promotes the expression of the regulated genes, while the negative coefficients represent down-regulation which represses the expression of the regulated genes, and the absolute values of the coefficients indicate the corresponding regulation strengths. The discovered regulation relationships can potentially provide insights to revealing the molecular signaling pathways.",
