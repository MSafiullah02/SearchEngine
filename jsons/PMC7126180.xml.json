            "text": "Ribosomes (see Glossary) are cellular factories that produce proteins in all cells using the nucleotide sequence of mRNAs as a blueprint. Nucleotide triplets of an mRNA \u2013 the codons \u2013 are translated into an amino acid sequence of a protein. The selection of the translation start and the reading frame on an mRNA is tightly controlled during the initiation phase of protein synthesis. The subsequent elongation phase entails repeated cycles of codon decoding by aminoacyl-tRNA, peptide bond formation, and tRNA\u2013mRNA translocation. Elongation cycles continue until the ribosome reaches a stop codon, on which translation is terminated. It is intuitively clear that translation of an mRNA sequence into a protein must be colinear and highly accurate. Errors can lead to the formation of toxic or misfolded proteins, increase the energetic cost of translation, and cause additional load on the cellular clean-up and quality-control machineries [1]. To avoid this burden, cells have evolved sophisticated control mechanisms that ensure the fidelity of decoding and reading frame maintenance. However, in special cases, the ribosomes, guided by signals encoded in the mRNA, abandon the principle of mRNA\u2013protein colinearity and read the message in an alternative way, which results in mRNA recoding (Box 1\n) 2, 3, 4. Programmed frameshifting is a recoding event that can occur in the + or \u2212 direction relative to the normal 0-frame mRNA translation by shifting the ribosome by one or two nucleotides, thereby producing two (or even three) different proteins from one mRNA. In contrast to spontaneous frameshifting, which is infrequent, the efficiency of programmed frameshifting may be as high as 80%, although in many cases it is only a few percent [5]. Programmed frameshifting increases the coding potential of the genome and is often used to expand the variability of cellular proteomes, adapt to changing environments, or ensure a defined stoichiometry of protein products. The mechanisms of +1 and \u22121 frameshifting appear to be different, and particularly the mechanism of \u22121 programmed ribosome frameshifting (\u22121PRF), its abundance, and physiological significance have remained unclear for a long time. The advances of biophysical techniques and reconstitution of highly-purified translation systems has recently provided new insight into how and when ribosomes slip into the \u22121 reading frame. New examples of \u22121PRF in eukaryotes and the identification of previously unknown trans-acting elements show how cells can regulate gene expression through frameshifting. This review is intended to summarize these recent breakthroughs in understanding the mechanism and biological importance of \u22121PRF.Box 1Translational recoding eventsProtein synthesis is usually very accurate. If nevertheless an error occurs it can lead to insertion of a wrong amino acid into a protein at a particular position due to incorrect decoding of a sense codon (a missense error) or a stop codon (stop-codon read-through). Alternatively, the ribosome may spontaneously change the reading frame on the mRNA, resulting in a completely different protein sequence (frameshifting). Spontaneous missense, nonsense, or frameshifting errors occur at frequencies of 10\u22127 to 10\u22123 per codon 57, 58, 59, 60.In contrast to spontaneous errors during elongation, recoding, or reprogrammed genetic decoding, is a process that alters the reading of individual codons (usually stop codons), alleviates the colinearity of mRNA and protein, or changes the reading frame of an mRNA. Recoding events are usually \u2018programmed\u2019 by stimulatory elements in the mRNA. The efficiency of recoding can reach up to 80% of normal translation 61, 62, 63. Main types of recoding are read-through, ribosomal frameshifting, and bypassing (Figure I\n) 3, 4. A stop codon can be interpreted as a sense codon for non-standard amino acids, such as selenocysteine or pyrrolysine (read-through). The ribosome can skip a part of the mRNA producing a single protein from a discontinuous reading frame (bypassing); examples of bypassing are in gene60 of bacteriophage T4 and in the mitochondrial genome of the yeast Magnusiomycetes\n62, 64, 65. Slippage of the ribosome in + or \u2212 direction changes the reading frame on the mRNA. The best known examples of +1 frameshifting are the RF2 gene in bacteria [66] and the ornithine decarboxylase gene [67] in eukaryotes; examples of \u22121PRF are summarized in Table 1.",

            "text": "Although the large majority of reported frameshifting sequences have so far been found in viral genomes, programmed frameshifting exists in all branches of life from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. The important role of \u22121PRF in viruses and bacteria is well documented [6]. In bacteria, \u22121PRF is required to produce the \u03b3 subunit of DNA polymerase III and is particularly abundant in bacterial transposable elements, which use \u22121PRF to generate their transposase 2, 7. \u22121PRF is also found in several families of eukaryotic viruses, where it is often used for the expression of viral replicases [8]. In retroviruses such as HIV, \u22121PRF is necessary to produce the DNA polymerase Pol and defines the ratio of Gag to Pol proteins. Because this ratio should not exceed a particular threshold value to maintain efficient virus assembly, genome packaging and maturation [9], changing \u22121PRF efficiency can be detrimental to the virus 10, 11. In comparison to viruses and bacterial mobile elements, only a few examples of \u22121PRF have been described in higher eukaryotes, although computational analysis have predicted that \u223c10% of cellular mRNAs may be controlled by \u22121PRF [12]. Recent evidence suggests that \u22121PRF may have unexpected roles in regulating not only the production of particular proteins but also in regulating mRNA and DNA stability (Table 1\n). Dinman and colleagues demonstrated operational \u22121PRF signals in four mRNAs encoding proteins crucial for yeast telomerase maintenance [13], and reported an example of eukaryotic \u22121 PRF in ccr5 and six other genes for cytokine receptors [14]. Overexpression of the telomerase gene Est2 through inhibition of frameshifting leads to formation of shorter telomeres, suggesting the importance of \u22121PRF for the maintenance of eukaryotic genomes [13]. Translation in the \u22121 frame of ccr5 leads to a premature stop, which targets the mRNA for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) [14]. This appears to be a general phenomenon because, for the large majority of predicted genes, \u22121PRF leads to premature termination less than 30 codons beyond the frameshifting site [15]. Thus, in eukaryotic genomes \u22121PRF can be used to regulate gene expression. Another notable example is the embryonal carcinoma differentiation regulated gene (edr), where \u22121PRF regulates the synthesis of two distinct polypeptides [16]. Edr is a single-copy gene in mice and humans. Its expression is regulated in a spatiotemporal manner during embryogenesis, suggesting a role of \u22121PRF in development [17]. Global analysis of dual decoding potential in human cells revealed several new examples of alternative frame reading in ribosome profiling data [18]. By analogy, one can expect more examples of \u22121PRF emerging with advances in high-throughput analysis of cellular proteomes. Together, these findings indicate that \u22121PRF may be more abundant and more important in eukaryotic cells than previously thought.",

The crucial regulatory element is the so-called slippery sequence, which is usually a heptameric sequence with the pattern X XXY\nYYZ (the underlined sequence denotes the 0-frame codons). The slippery sequence ensures correct base-pairing between the mRNA codon and the tRNA anticodon before and after the slippage, provided that the 0-frame and \u22121-frame codons can be decoded by the same tRNA through wobble interactions at the third codon position [XXY (0-frame) vs XXX (\u22121-frame), or YYZ (0-frame) vs YYY (\u22121-frame)]. Another stimulatory element is an mRNA secondary structure element, usually a pseudoknot or a stem-loop located 5\u20138 nt downstream of the slippery sequence. Interestingly, antisense oligonucleotides or guanine-rich sequences that can fold into four-stranded structures of stacked guanine-tetrads, so-called G-quadruplexes, can also stimulate \u22121PRF, reaching efficiencies up to 40% 20, 21. In addition, in some cases a Shine\u2013Dalgarno-like element 11\u201314 nt upstream of the first slippery codon [22] or even long-distance base-pairing appear to stimulate frameshifting [23].",

            "text": "To understand the mechanism of \u22121PRF, it is first essential to identify the precise timing of slippage and the position of the frameshifting ribosome on the slippery sequence. One straightforward way to determine the timing of slippage is to analyze the kinetics of translation at each codon before, over, and after the slippery sequence (through a \u2018codon walk\u2019) to find the step which is different for ribosomes that undergo \u22121PRF compared to those continuing unperturbed translation in the 0-frame. Previous reports suggested that a ribosome, when it encounters a frameshifting pseudoknot or a stem-loop, pauses or even drops off the mRNA track 24, 25, 26. Such losses in translation rate and efficiency can be reliably monitored by rapid kinetic analysis that monitors the chemical reactions during translation. For example, the stepwise insertion of amino acids into the nascent peptide can be measured using the quench-flow technique (Figure 2\n) [27]. The outcome of \u22121PRF can be also monitored by mass spectrometry or peptide analysis 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, which may provide information about the slippage pathway. Alternatively, the timing of \u22121PRF can be identified by following single ribosomes while they translate the mRNA using various techniques, such as optical tweezers [28] or single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 34, 35, 36. In the latter case, fluorescence labels must be attached to elements of the ribosome or to tRNAs. Translation is then monitored using changes in FRET efficiency between two reporters, or fluorescence changes of single reporters 35, 36. Fluorescence and FRET approaches were also used in ensemble kinetic experiments using the stopped-flow technique [27].",

IBV 1a/1b is a model system that \u2013 after some adjustments in the frameshifting signals \u2013 works well in eukaryotic and bacterial cells 27, 37. The frameshifting site of the IBV 1a/1b construct optimized for E. coli contains a slippery sequence U UUA AAG followed by a pseudoknot 6 nt downstream of the slippery sequence. When translation in the 0-frame is not perturbed by \u22121PRF signals, the ribosome rapidly moves over the mRNA incorporating Tyr, Leu, Lys, and Phe (the 0-frame amino acids) at rates of 4\u201315 s\u22121\n[27]. Tyr, Leu, and Lys are also rapidly incorporated when the \u22121PRF stimulatory signals are present (Figure 2C). However, Phe insertion is delayed (insertion into peptide is 0.1 s\u22121, 40-fold slower than during normal translation) and inefficient (on only 25% of the ribosomes). Instead, the \u22121-frame amino acid Val is preferentially incorporated (on 75% of the ribosomes), albeit also at a low rate (0.3 s\u22121). Notably, Phe and Val tRNAs do not compete with one another for binding to the ribosome, indicating that the partitioning of the ribosomes between the 0- and \u22121-frames occurs after Lys insertion, but before the next codon is decoded. These data indicate that commitment to the alternative frame occurs sometime after Lys insertion, but before the next decoding step. Thus, \u22121PRF must take place during the movement of the ribosome over the slippery sequence, when peptidyl-tRNALys is translocated from the A to the P site of the ribosome, while tRNALeu moves from the P to the E site [27]. Notably, as the ribosome sets out to move over the slippery codons, the pseudoknot/stem-loop is located 12 nt from position 1 of the P-site codon, very close to the entry to the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome [38]. Translocation over the slippery sequence would require that the first two base-pairs of the pseudoknot/stem-loop structure open up to enter the channel. Thus, to continue translation, the ribosome must unwind the double strand at the base of the pseudoknot.",

The frameshifting sequence of dnaX has the slippery sequence A AAA AAG, an mRNA stem-loop structure as a stalling element located 6 nt downstream, and a Shine\u2013Dalgarno-like sequence upstream of the slippery sequence (Figure 1B). Mass spectrometry of translated products showed that ribosomes can slip not only by \u22121 but also by \u22124 or +2 nt, suggesting the existence of alternative frameshifting sites [28]. Similarly to IBV 1a/1b, slippage on dnaX occurs during tRNA translocation 28, 35, 36. Earlier work suggested that \u2212PRF may occur by different pathways [29] and, accordingly, Chen et al.\n[35] reported that tRNA accommodation contributed to frameshifting in addition to translocation. By contrast, Yan et al.\n[28] did not find any evidence for \u22121PRF pathways via schemes other that translocation; such alternative pathways were rigorously ruled out for IBV 1a/1b\n[27]. The timing of \u22121PRF on dnaX may depend on the position and strength of the Shine\u2013Dalgarno-like sequence and the exact location of the stem-loop base. A codon walk over the dnaX sequence, and over other examples of frameshifting sequences, should clarify how the regulatory elements govern the timing and mechanism of \u22121PRF.",

            "text": "Recent results from ensemble kinetics and smFRET suggest a picture of what takes place on the ribosome during frameshifting (Figure 3\n). Frameshifting signals have only a small effect on the conformational dynamics of the ribosome before tRNA-mRNA translocation [in the pre-translocation (PRE) state, Box 2\n] [36]. The rate of EF-G binding to the PRE state is somewhat reduced by the presence of the pseudoknot [27]. However, these effects are mild and do not limit the rate of subsequent steps. In addition, the rate of tRNA movement after EF-G recruitment is not affected by frameshifting 27, 35, 36. Notably, at this stage the tRNA anticodons move together with the head of the 30S subunit [27]. However, from this point on translocation on frameshifting ribosomes is perturbed. The tRNA bound on the first slippery codon (XXY) is retained in the E site longer than normally. EF-G apparently must undertake multiple binding attempts and remains bound to the ribosome for a longer time before translocation is completed 27, 35, 36. The ribosome is stalled in a long-lived rotated (or even hyper-rotated) state 35, 39, and backward movement of the 30S subunit is impeded [27]. Thus, during \u22121PRF ribosomes are trapped in a metastable state in which both backward movement of the 30S head and reverse rotation of the 30S subunit are impeded, most probably by the pseudoknot/stem-loop blocking the entrance to the mRNA tunnel. Although both dissociation of the E-site tRNA and backward rotation of the 30S subunit are slow, the E-site tRNA is released before the ribosome rotates backwards [35]. This would suggest that there is a time-window when only one tRNA is bound to the ribosome. Furthermore, such a metastable ribosome conformation may also destabilize the tRNA in the P site [40], which may increase the chance of slippage. The ribosomes can also undergo back-and-forth translocation excursions exploring alternative reading frames [28]\nBox 2TranslocationMovement of the ribosome along the mRNA is a complex, multiphasic process which is catalyzed by the translation elongation factor G (EF-G) in bacteria (Figure I\n) (for recent review, see [68] and references therein). Before translocation, deacylated tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA reside in the P and A sites of the ribosome, respectively, with their anticodons attached to the mRNA codons on the 30S ribosomal subunit (the pre-translocation or PRE complex). On the 50S subunit, the 3\u2032 ends of the tRNAs can spontaneously move from their classical (C) positions in the P and A sites towards E and P sites, respectively, entering the so-called hybrid (H) states. Concomitantly, ribosomal subunits rotate relative to one another from the classical non-rotated (N) to the rotated (R) state. Recruitment of EF-G and GTP hydrolysis promote rapid translocation of the tRNAs on both ribosomal subunits. At this point in time, the head of the 30S subunit moves together with the tRNAs and mRNA. Then, the E-site tRNA and EF-G become free to spontaneously dissociate from the ribosome, the head of the 30S subunit moves backwards, and the 30S subunit as a whole rotates relative to the 50S subunit into the N state, resulting in a post-translocation state (POST). These steps form the conformational landscape of translocation and couple the energy of Brownian motion and GTP hydrolysis of EF-G to the directed movement of the ribosome along the mRNA.Although translocation is obviously a complex process, there are well-established methods to follow the elemental steps by ensemble kinetics and single-molecule techniques. One reliable diagnostic test to determine whether the peptidyl-tRNA has been translocated to the P site is the ability of peptidyl-tRNA to react with the antibiotic puromycin that replaces aminoacyl-tRNA as the A-site substrate: if peptidyl-tRNA rapidly reacts with puromycin it is in the authentic P site on the 50S subunit. To monitor the kinetic steps of translocation a variety of fluorescence labels attached to mRNA, tRNA, or the ribosome have been utilized, for example to measure FRET between two ribosome-bound tRNA; between the P/E site tRNA and ribosomal proteins L1 or S13; or the A/P site tRNA and the ribosomal protein L11 27, 34, 35, 36. Rotation is monitored using fluorescence reporters attached to the 30S and 50S subunits [69]. Finally, EF-G binding and dissociation can be followed using labels in EF-G on one side and ribosomal proteins L11 or L12 on the other side 27, 34.",

            "text": "Deciphering the molecular mechanism of \u22121PRF provides novel insights into the roles of the regulatory elements in the mRNA. In general, the presence of the pseudoknot/stem-loop structure stalls the ribosome by impeding translocation 27, 34, 35, 36 (Figure 2D). Optical-trap experiments have shown that folded elements in the mRNA decrease elongation rates and that the mRNA structure stability correlates with elongation velocity [42]. The pseudoknot/stem-loop may act as a roadblock for rapid translation. Because the size of the double-helical stem region of the pseudoknot or a hairpin (21 \u00c5) is larger than the average diameter of the mRNA tunnel (15 \u00c5) [43], the mRNA must unwind before entering the tunnel. The bacterial ribosome has an intrinsic helicase activity attributed to the 30S subunit proteins S3, S4, and S5 [38]. This mechanism may work in both pro- and eukaryotic systems because the helicase residues in S3 and S5 are evolutionarily conserved. The ribosome may exploit charged residues in proteins S3, S4, and S5 to unwind the mRNA either actively, acting as a processivity clamp, or passively, by stabilizing the open form of the mRNA at the entrance of the mRNA tunnel [41]. For complex RNA structures such as a pseudoknot, its overall thermodynamic stability does not directly correlate with the efficiency of frameshifting; instead, the stability of the double strand at the mRNA entrance channel of the ribosome at the base of the pseudoknot is important [44]. In addition, the downstream RNA secondary structure may dynamically switch between different conformations [45], explaining why structural plasticity is important for \u22121PRF [46]. Interestingly, ribosome stalling at an mRNA roadblock inhibits dissociation of the E-site tRNA and EF-G even in the absence of frameshifting 27, 34, suggesting a global effect of an mRNA roadblock on ribosome dynamics.",

One group of potential \u22121PRF regulators acting in trans are antibiotics [48]. Ketolide antibiotics such as erythromycin (Erm) promote frameshifting at the ermC mRNA leader segment (ermCL). Expression of ermCL regulates the expression of the downstream ermC resistance gene, allowing the translating ribosome to enter the intergenic spacer and alter the mRNA structure in a way that unmasks the start codon of ermC and leads to the translation of the main ermC open reading frame (ORF) [49]. The slippage in ermCL occurs on a run of adenine residues, AAA AAA, at the last two sense codons of ermCL. Such a slippery sequence would allow tRNALys (anticodon UUU) to re-pair to the alternative Lys codon in the \u22121-frame, similarly to what is observed in the IBV 1a/1b system. How exactly ketolides, which bind in the peptide exit channel of the 50S subunit, promote frameshifting is not known. One possibility is that stalling of translation by a roadblock in the exit tunnel has a similar effect on the slippage as a roadblock in the mRNA. A similar regulatory principle may be utilized in other bacterial and eukaryotic genes that are activated in response to different environmental conditions 49, 50.",

A putative RNA-binding domain in the nsp1\u03b2 protein is likely to bind to a conserved CCCANCUCC motif located 11 nt downstream of the slippery sequence. The complex (alone or with other cellular components) may provide a roadblock analogous to a pseudoknot/stem-loop structure, favoring ribosome rearrangements that may lead to \u22121PRF. Notably, nsp1\u03b2 appears to interact with rpS14, a ribosomal protein located close to the ribosomal helicase site [51].

            "text": "A special group of trans-acting factors comprises proteins or RNAs that stabilize or destabilize the stimulatory mRNA element. For example, annexin A2 (ANXA2) binds to the IBV pseudoknot; overexpression of ANXA2 reduces \u22121PRF, whereas knockdown of the protein stimulates \u22121PRF [52]. Because ANXA2 has been implicated in diverse cellular functions, including exocytosis, DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, the protein may contribute to the host defense in virus-infected cells by inhibiting frameshifting. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) can also modulate \u22121PRF by binding to the pseudoknot. The efficiency of \u22121PRF on ccr5 mRNA, coding for the cytokine receptor used by HIV, appears to be modulated by at least two different miRNAs [14]. Binding of miRNAs stabilizes the frameshifting pseudoknot, thereby leading to increased \u22121PRF. miRNA-regulated \u22121PRF has also been demonstrated in mRNAs encoding six other cytokine receptors. Finally, a more complex example of regulation by a protein (or a group of proteins) is provided by the viral Tat protein, a regulatory protein that upregulates the efficiency of HIV transcription. Tat modulates \u22121PRF by binding to the TAR region in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) on the HIV mRNA or by some indirect effect related to disruption of Tat\u2013TAR interaction [53]. Destabilization of the Tat\u2013TAR interactions in the mRNA 5\u2032 UTR would facilitate the ribosome access to the start codon of gag/pol mRNA and accelerate ribosome loading. As a result, the distance between the ribosomes translating HIV mRNA would not provide enough time for the frameshifting stem-loop structure to refold between the passages of consecutive ribosomes [54]. Furthermore, Tat also regulates translation by favoring cap- over internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiation. Because IRES-dependent translation makes much less \u22121PRF than does cap-dependent translation, the switch from cap- to IRES-mediated initiation alters the overall amount of the \u22121-frame Pol product [53]. Thus, translation efficiency per se can modulate \u22121PRF 25, 55. Along the same lines, changes in global translation rates may account for the stimulation of \u22121PRF upon downregulation of eukaryotic translation release factor levels [56]. Together, these results highlight a complex network of trans-acting factors that can modulate \u22121PRF.",

Steps 3 and 4 are particularly slow for the tRNA that remains in 0-frame, which limits the decoding rate in the 0-frame by Phe-tRNAPhe (step 5). By contrast, tRNALeu movement on those ribosomes that shift to the \u22121-frame is faster (step 6), followed by dissociation of tRNALeu from the 30S subunit, 30S head rotation, dissociation of EF-G (step 7), and binding of Val-tRNAVal (step 8).
