            "text": "Despite the practical relevance of digitalization, academic research in this area was limited at the time we proposed this special issue. We noticed a large gap between theory and practice: academic papers hardly discussed the effects of digitalization on the finance function, while in our meetings with practitioners this was generally the only topic on the agenda. Many practitioners indicated that the potential impact on management accounting practices and the finance function was huge, with several companies having special transformation departments (for example in marketing, human resources, and finance) to guide the digital transition.",

Most of the papers are largely conceptual (e.g. Bhimani & Willcocks, 2014; Quattrone, 2016; Arnaboldi, Busco, & Cuganesan, 2017a, b; Appelbaum et al., 2017), with some case studies (Arnaboldi, Azzone, & Sidorova, 2017a, b) and empirical analyses (Labro et al., 2019; Oesterreich et al., 2019). The field still appears dominated by consultants and practice pioneers (e.g. McKinsey, 2018; Deloitte, 2020). We believe that the development is too important for academia to leave it at that. The topic deserves a careful definition (what exactly are we talking about?), as there are many \u2018digitalization topics\u2019 that may have a different impact on the finance function. In addition to this, an overview and structuration of the field as well as conceptual ideas and reflection may be required.",

Controllers should play an active role in addressing digital opportunities and corresponding changes in business models and organizational strategies. That has many implications. Controllers not only need to develop and adapt new KPIs, but also flexible steering approaches (e.g. the Objective and Key Results system) and new portfolio techniques, mixing traditional with digital business models. In addition, traditional capital budgeting or investment control approaches might be inadequate in the context of exponential growth fueled by digital products, platform strategies, and network economies.",

Creating and maintaining such \u2018a single source of truth\u2019 is a core responsibility of controllers that is, however, increasingly challenged by data scientists and other functions like IT. In the WHU digitalization pulse check, Sch\u00e4ffer and Weber (2018b) find that only 50% of chief data officers in large German companies report to the chief financial officer (CFO) or (in one case) the head of controlling. In other words, in half of the companies, the person ultimately responsible for data quality does not report to the person who traditionally claims to be the company\u2019s single source of truth regarding financial data and the interpretation thereof. In addition, new information routines might lead to a more decentralized, self-service-based reporting and decision-making environment that may change the nature of control as well as the role of controllers. The use of chat bots and other robotic process automation techniques can create efficiency gains, but requires sound governance.",

Kolthof et al., 2017b; Sch\u00e4ffer & Brueckner 2019). On an organizational level, the finance function will likely face a reduction in size (in the number of full-time equivalents; see Frey & Osborne, 2017; Sch\u00e4ffer 2017).

They conducted three studies on the future of controlling (2012, 2015, and 2018a). In the first survey, the average difference between the perceived importance of the top ranked controlling trends in 2011 and the importance expected in five years from then was 0.39 points (on a 7-point Likert scale). The respective delta points increased to 0.73 in 2014 and 1.00 in the 2017 study; the latter increase being primarily driven by trends relating to digitalization.",

The authors consistently found that actual implementation is still in its infancy: 50% of the controllers surveyed indicated that their company has no digitalization strategy for controlling, while 30% reported the presence of only a preliminary strategy and a mere 6% of companies reported a relatively mature digitalization strategy in controlling. In addition, only 12% of respondents consider their company\u2019s financial investment in the digitalization of controlling to be sufficient. Similarly, in the Netherlands Kolthof et al. (2017a) found that robotic process automation (RPA) is used in transaction processing for less than 50% of the activities.

However, most controllers are not inherently competent in this area.

In the companies they surveyed, data scientists typically worked in IT and operations and only 22% of companies that employ data scientists did so in the controlling function. The findings also indicate relatively little interaction between controllers and data scientists, regardless of whether the latter work in controlling or elsewhere. According to respondents, controllers and data scientists work closely together in only 17% of companies in the sample of the WHU digitalization pulse check (Sch\u00e4ffer & Weber, 2018b).",

            "text": "So why does it take so long for the postulated transformation of the controlling function to get underway? First of all, we know from numerous studies that processes of fundamental change take time\u2014at least when the changes are to be sustainable and more substantial than merely scratching the surface (Frey & Osborne, 2017). For example, Pritsch (2000) showed that it took at least 25 years\u2014an entire generation\u2014for the NPV method to become widespread (cf. Pritsch, 2000). In addition, the call for a new and more proactive controller role is not new, but can be traced back to the 1970s (see Henzler, 1974; Z\u00fcnd, 1985; Siegel, 1999). However, many controllers still seem reluctant to act as business partners and the concept is far from being intern internalized by the majority of controllers in the field. And finally, the study by Sch\u00e4ffer and Matlachowsky (2008) demonstrates that even a structured implementation project provides no guarantee that an instrument\u2019s use (specifically the balanced scorecard) will be securely anchored long-term and that this process often spans many years. In all three examples, sustainable change in the finance function is therefore a long process that cannot be measured in months or a few years. Why should this be any different in the case of digitalization?",

However, anecdotal as well as more substantive empirical evidence seems to show that CEOs tend to prioritize areas that directly add to corporate value creation, such as marketing and supply chain. Internal service providers tend to be deprioritized, resulting in the finance function being a relative latecomer as far as digital transformation is concerned. This may have implications for the overall status of the finance function and for its role in digital transformation. Indeed, the WHU digitalization pulse check of Sch\u00e4ffer and Weber informs us that only slightly more than half (56%) of digital steering committees include members from the finance function. A relatively large portion of German companies therefore appear to address digitalization topics without directly involving the finance function.",

We have selected five articles for this special issue: Alnoor Bhimani starts with an overview of digital data and management accounting\u2014why we need to rethink research methods. The next two articles focus on the effects of digitalization on core controlling processes: budgeting and reporting. Mareike Bergmann, Christian Br\u00fcck, Thorsten Knauer and Anja Schwering deal with the digitalization of the budgeting process. Based on an empirical study, they research the determinants of the use of business analytics and its effect on satisfaction with the budgeting process. Lisa Perkhofer, Conny Walchshofer and Peter Hofer focus on visualizing the design of big data and investigate the effect of visualization type and interaction in an empirical study. Then we enlarge the perspective on the overall control system in two articles with a more holistic approach: Thorsten Knauer, Nicole Nikiforow and Sebastian Wagener deal with information systems, but on a more abstract level, by analyzing determinants of information system quality and data quality. Finally, Gianluca Vitale, Sebastiano Cupertino and Angelo Riccaboni show the interplay between formal and informal control systems, influenced by big data based on a case study.",
