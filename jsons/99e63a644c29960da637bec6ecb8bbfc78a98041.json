Whether these parasites secrete proteins capable of interfering with host ubiquitination in nucleated cells remains to be determined. As a eukaryote, Plasmodium possesses its own post-translational modifying machinery, including a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

The quality of the mass spectra obtained and the extent of sequence coverage allowed robust and unambiguous identification (Fig. 3) . Although the gene designation suggests DUB activity, as determined by sequence similarity with known mammalian UCH-type enzymes, these data are the first evidence that this gene product is both expressed and functional. For this reason, the identified protein was named PfUCH54, for P. falciparum Ub C-terminal hydrolase with a molecular mass of 54 kDa. The discrepancy in predicted versus observed size of the protein (54 kDa versus ~100 kDa) can possibly be explained by aggregation in the course of electrophoresis. It has been established that consecutive repetitions of a single amino acid, such as glutamine or alanine, can lead to protein aggregations (Ravikumar et al., 2002) . We believe that the homopolymeric region of asparagines embedded in the PfUCH54 sequence may cause the observed aggregation. Peptides matching PfUCH54 were also recovered from 65 kDa and 40 kDa regions of the gel. The 65 kDa mass is consistent with a 54 kDa protein with a 10 kDa probe attachment, while the 40 kDa fragment most likely represents a degradation product. Mass spectral quality for these polypeptides was inferior to that of the 100 kDa band, hence, the latter data are presented in Fig. 3 . When a BLAST database homology search was performed (use of BLOSUM62 matrix, gap costs for existence 11 and for extension 1; low-complexity filter), the human proteasome-associated DUB, UCH37, was identified as a homologue (e-value of 1 \u00a5 10 -30 ) despite its significantly smaller size. A sequence alignment of these two proteins, in addition to two other well-characterized human DUBs, UCH-L1 and UCH-L3, revealed only moderate sequence identity but conservation of all active site residues, consistent with the observed DUB activity of the parasitic protein (Fig. 4A ). The predicted active residues for PfUCH54 are Cys145, His220 and Asp235. The insertion of a homopolymeric asparagine stretch in the parasite sequence is common to many expressed proteins (Pizzi and Frontali, 2001) in P. falciparum. Although the function of these lowcomplexity homopolymeric regions is not known, they may serve as sites of interaction with other proteins or may expand the parasite's antigenic repertoire, thereby contributing to immune evasion (Schofield, 1991) . As the crystal structure of UCH-L3 has been solved (Johnston et al., 1997; Misaghi et al., 2005) and as the structure of UCH37, the closest PfUCH54 homologue, is predicted to be very similar (Kelley et al., 2000) , we prepared a threaded model of PfUCH54 based on that of UCH-L3 (Fig. 4B) . The predicted structure of the PfUCH54 insertions were calculated using ROSETTA (Bystroff and Shao, 2002) and manually inserted into the final model (Guex and Peitsch, 1997) . We were encouraged to see that the three major insertions in the parasitic protein sequence (shown in green in the model) are unlikely to interfere with the predicted architecture of the catalytic site (active cysteine residue shown in blue), as was confirmed by experiment (see Fig. 5 ). If these homopolymeric amino acid stretches serve a function, it is likely one not directly related to the protein's enzymatic activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1031, "end": 1055, "text": "(Ravikumar et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2324, "end": 2350, "text": "(Pizzi and Frontali, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2599, "end": 2616, "text": "(Schofield, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2670, "end": 2693, "text": "(Johnston et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2694, "end": 2715, "text": "Misaghi et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2810, "end": 2831, "text": "(Kelley et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2990, "end": 3015, "text": "(Bystroff and Shao, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3059, "end": 3083, "text": "(Guex and Peitsch, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 369, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1561, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2133, "text": "(Fig. 4A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2898, "end": 2907, "text": "(Fig. 4B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3365, "end": 3371, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Identification of Ub-VME-reactive proteins"}, {"text": "To verify DUB activity for this protein and to probe the extent of possible deNeddylating, deSUMOylating and deISG15ylating activity, the PfUCH54 coding region (which does not contain introns) was cloned from genomic DNA and a catalytically inactive mutant was generated based on this sequence by mutating the putative active site cysteine residue to serine.

Differences in the ubiquitinproteasome system have been successfully used for diagnosis of parasitic diseases (Telles et al., 2003) . The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is ancient and has been conserved throughout evolution (Catic and Ploegh, 2005) , and the dynamic addition and removal of Ub is central to a wide variety of eukaryotic cellular processes in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. The many effects of ubiquitination render the enzymes that act on Ub crucial to proper cellular function and survival, a possible target for development of methods to handicap pathogens. The evolutionary distance between the parasite and its host may have resulted in differences in enzyme structure sufficient to allow selective inhibition, with the core function of the enzyme remaining conserved. Interference with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been successfully targeted in cancer therapy (Voorhees and Orlowski, 2006) but has been largely overlooked within infectious disease, particularly with regard to diseases of significant public health importance, such as malaria. Indeed, interference with protein degradation in P. falciparum, by blocking proteasome function, results in growth inhibition and toxicity to the parasite (Gantt et al. 1998; Lindenthal et al., 2005) and validates this pathway as a legitimate drug target. Given the variety of molecules that mediate this branch of the ubiquitination pathway, more specific and elegant therapies might be developed by targeting individual components of the processing cascade, rather than by indiscriminately blocking the proteasome itself. The data presented here establish the expression and functionality of the enzyme PfUCH54, both as a deubiquitinating and as a deNeddylating agent and provide the first experimental evidence that these enzyme families are active in P. falciparum. The dual deubiquitinating and deNeddylating activity of PfUCH54 is reminiscent of UCH-L3 dual reactivity (Wada et al., 1998) and has been reported for other enzymes as well (Linghu et al., 2002; Misaghi et al., 2005) , suggesting that this dual activity may be a widespread, conserved and significant phenomenon. Although the alignment of UCH-L3 with PfUCH54 does not show a high level of identity between the two proteins, putative active site amino acids reside within highly conserved sequence blocks. The dual specificity observed for PfUCH54 does not allow us to state with confidence whether its primary function is to target Ub-modified or Nedd8-modified proteins. Nedd8's role, as far as is known, is restricted to the modification of cullins, which are part of the SCF-type Ub ligases involved in cell cycle control (Chiba and Tanaka, 2004) . It is possible that PfUCH54 may contribute to regulation of both Ub and Nedd8 conjugation in P. falciparum. The Nedd8 reactivity of PfUCH54 is of particular interest given that mammalian and parasitic Nedd8 share only 52% identity. Nonetheless, there are three distinct blocks of conserved sequence (aa 5-11, 42-50, Fig. 5 . Evidence of dual Ub and Nedd8 specificity for PfUCH54. In vitro transcription/translation using HA-tagged, wild-type PfUCH54 (left) and the catalytically inactive cysteine to serine mutant (right) as templates was performed in the presence of 35 S-methionine. Translation products were reacted with the range of untagged probes followed by immunoprecipitation against HA. Analysis by autoradiography reveals Ub and Nedd8 activity specific to the wild-type PfUCH54. Two unreactive truncated translation products are indicated by asterisk.
