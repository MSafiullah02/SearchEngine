            "text": "Every year, respiratory viruses cause seasonal epidemics. In Northern Europe, the epidemic season starts in September\u2013October and lasts until April. Since several respiratory pathogens are circulating at the same time and typical symptoms of different respiratory infections (cough, fever, rhinitis, headache etc.) are quite similar, it can be difficult to identify and diagnose different pathogens based on symptoms alone. To be able to avoid unnecessary antimicrobial treatment and to focus antiviral treatment properly, rapid and reliable detection of respiratory pathogens is needed. At the moment, verified viral results in Finland are reported to the Register for Infectious Diseases of the National Institute for Health and Welfare (NIHW, http://www.thl.fi/ttr/gen/rpt/tilastot.html, [1]). Data from this national register go to The European Surveillance System (TESSy), a data bank organised by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC, [2]), and these European-wide data are further combined with data collected all over the world by the World Health Organization (WHO, [3]). After the data are collected, they need to be analysed and further processed into reports, and this can take 1\u20132 weeks. Thus, although these reports are extensive and usually rapidly and widely available in electronic format, the data themselves have already expired. In addition, at least in Finland, the data do not represent the outpatient setting, but hospitalised patients and military recruits. New rapid and automated multianalyte tests could potentially help to provide more accurate and real-time data to help health care professionals in infection management and containment, especially in outpatient settings.",

The automated mariPOC\u00ae analyser has been designed for point-of-care use and it can be connected to laboratory information systems (LIS).

Samples were taken from patients suffering from typical symptoms of respiratory tract infection, whenever aetiological diagnostics was considered necessary by the attending physician. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and handled as previously described [4, 5].

During the 2013\u20132014 annual epidemic, IAV and RSV peaks arrived in adjacent weeks (7 and 8/2014) in Southern Finland, whereas in other parts of Finland, the IAV peak came 3 to 5 weeks earlier than the RSV peak (Fig. 5a, b). Geographically, a wider variation was seen in the RSV annual epidemiological peak compared to the IAV peak. RSV epidemics also lasted longer than IAV epidemics, and broader peaks were detected especially on the west coast of Finland (Fig. 5b). In early 2013, there was also a small IBV epidemic in Western Finland, which was detected in week 8/2013, simultaneously with the IAV peak (Fig. 3).\n",

A positive preliminary result is true in 97 % of cases, on average. For IAV, the positive predictive value is up to 97.8 %, and for RSV 99.1 % (data not shown). Negative fluorescence readouts (results) are not reported in the preliminary phase, since some may turn positive in the 2 h that it takes for the assay to reach equilibrium. Nevertheless, the negative predictive value of the preliminary results (no results shown) is 98 %, indicating that most of the preliminary negatives remain negative for that particular analyte also after 2 h. Typically, POC tests are rapid, but less sensitive than polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. However, mariPOC\u00ae antigen detection has shown good sensitivity, especially in the detection of influenza viruses and RSV and group A Streptococcus, and the specificities of all methods have been excellent [4, 5, 9]. Ivaska et al. reported that mariPOC\u00ae had, in their study, only a moderate sensitivity for AdV and hMPV compared to PCR, but also noted that, sometimes, DNA/RNA findings by PCR may be clinically non-relevant [4].

Sharing this information with patients might make it easier for doctors to justify not prescribing antibiotics. Mehil\u00e4inen, a country-wide private health care provider in Finland, already has such a tool, where positive virus results and the numbers of tests performed in the laboratory are updated on a daily basis, and the epidemiological trend is presented in real time to their clinicians and laboratories all over the country.",

Thus, potentially available epidemiological data have reached completely new levels, and this should be put into use more efficiently for real-time epidemiological surveillance. In contrast to conventional rapid assays, the mariPOC\u00ae technique is characterised by an automated results readout. Thus, the analysers could be connected not only to LIS but also via the internet to a national or global database and surveillance system, allowing health care authorities to monitor ongoing infections online. Such a surveillance system would support the control of infectious diseases and epidemics, and provide an \u2018early warning\u2019 system for changes in pathogen activities [10\u201312]. Influenza virus, for example, causes milder disease before the epidemic peak arrives.

Although the test\u2019s slightly variable sensitivity against different viruses might have some impact on the results, the epidemiological picture produced by the mariPOC\u00ae respi test was well in line with virus results reported from the virology unit at the NIHW.

Our results show that the seasonal epidemics of respiratory pathogens start almost simultaneously all over Finland, and only slight variations in epidemiological peaks were detected geographically. Our geographically divided data also showed that the prevalence of different pathogens varied between different areas. For example, no clear RSV peak was detected in South-Eastern Finland, and the IBV epidemic in 2013 was concentrated in Southern Finland. In Northern Europe, IAV epidemics are concentrated in the winter months, and the peak is usually in February [14]. RSV epidemics occur simultaneously with IAV, and the peak is in February, but with a wider time span [14, 15]. Our results were in concordance with these reports: the IAV peak was commonly detected between weeks 7 and 9, whereas the annual RSV peak had a wider range (from week 7 in 2012 to week 14 in 2014).

Samples were taken from patients suffering from symptoms of respiratory infection; thus, the patients with a sample negative for the tested viruses probably had some other respiratory virus. For example, rhinovirus, which is the predominant cause of common cold, coronaviruses, which are a significant cause of common cold in adults, human bocavirus, which might cause lower respiratory tract infections and non-polio enteroviruses, which can cause mild respiratory symptoms, circulate at the same time as the pathogens currently included in the mariPOC\u00ae respi test panel [16\u201318]. Since the sensitivity of any rapid POC immunoassay test can hardly be 100 %, some positive cases have supposedly gone undetected. Based on the previous studies, this fraction may be expected to be 10\u201320 % with mariPOC\u00ae [4, 9].",

During off-season, between May and October, only sporadic infections are encountered, and only 1.4 % of tested samples are positive. Findings positive for pneumococci did not follow the seasonal epidemics, and the percentage of positive findings, 10 %, can signify carriage: 5\u201310 % of adult and >30 % of child patients have been reported to be carriers of pneumococci [8, 19].",

For example, IAV and RSV circulation shows a wave-like pattern, whereas adenovirus is present throughout the year. It is also commonly known that RSV causes larger epidemics biannually [15, 20], which could also be seen in our material: RSV was detected more frequently in samples in 2012 and 2014 compared to 2013 (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Based on these commonly known patterns for respiratory virus circulation, clinicians probably use this \u2018educated guess\u2019 when they order laboratory tests for their patients. However, this educated guess can also cause bias: if RSV is tested more often every other year, it can be expected to be found more frequently. If the mariPOC\u00ae multianalyte test is used, this forethought has no impact on results. With multianalyte testing, it is possible to get results on several pathogens simultaneously, and although the swab might have been taken to assure RSV positivity, the result might show that the patient actually has an adenovirus or an RSV\u2013pneumococcal co-infection. Our results show that viral co-infection was detected among 0.65 % of the tested samples (3 % of the positive samples), and 67 % of these were double infections, with RSV being the most common virus present in co-infections. Thus, mariPOC\u00ae detects and reports the actual epidemiological situation of respiratory pathogens.",
