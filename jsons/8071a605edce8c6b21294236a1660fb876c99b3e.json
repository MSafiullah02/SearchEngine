In a previous report of a case with pneumonia and severe respiratory distress, fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline mem-brane formation were the main histopathologic findings. 2 Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 is possible 3 and the pathologic findings in the lungs mentioned by Tian et al. 1 To the Editor: Thank you for forwarding the letter by Joob and Wiwanitkit 1 regarding our recent paper \"Pulmonary pathology of early phase 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia in two patients with lung cancer.\" 2 We thank Dr. Joob and Dr. Wiwanitkit for their interest in our work and appreciate their comments.",

Afterward, both patients were confirmed to have developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Retrospective reviews revealed radiographic changes in the patients' lungs around the time of the operation. Both patients had a history of exposure to the virus. Although the patients did not exhibit symptoms at the time of the operation, subsequent pathologic examination revealed changes as reported in the paper; 2 thus, this represents the early changes seen in COVID-19 pneumonia. As we know, many diseases can have radiographic or pathologic changes before clinical symptoms develop.",
