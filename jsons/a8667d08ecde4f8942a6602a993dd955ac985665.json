With most countries in some kind of lockdown, consumer demand for products and services has plummeted. The lockdown has also stalled production and service supply chains both nationally and internationally. Together with the human and medical system ramifications, this pandemic is causing significant job losses that will further drive demand downwards, thus leading to a potential global economic recession (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, 2020a) .

We then analyze how each financial ratio changes for every percentage change in sales within our theoretical framework. The first ratio is Cash burn rate, which measures how long a firm is able to finance its operating costs without further cash contributions from creditors or shareholders. In our context, this ratio indicates how many years it would take for the firm's current cash flow from operations to build up (if positive) or burn through (if negative) its cash holdings. The second financial ratio is Cash flow from operations to current liabilities ratio, which estimates the percentage of current liabilities, including short-term debt, covered by annual cash flows from operations, if these are positive, or the expected net growth in current liabilities, if the cash flows are negative. The third ratio is Cash flow from operations to total debt ratio, which measures the extent to which the cash flow from operations is sufficient to repay all liabilities, including noncurrent liabilities, if positive, or the percentage increase in noncurrent liabilities that the firm requires to cover its cash needs, if negative. Unlike the previous ratios, Cash flow from operations to total debt ratio measures a firm's long-term liquidity risk.",

The ratio of cash flow from operations to current liabilities is CFO=CL. Finally, the ratio of cash flow from operations to total debt is CFO=TD; where TD is equal to the sum of short-term and long-term debt. 8 Consistent with our discussion, when sales drop by a percentage equal to @Sales=Sales, the three ratios will become where @CFO is obtained from Eq. (1) and @CL is obtained from Eq. (2). All the other variables are defined as above.",

            "text": "To clarify the interpretation of these three ratios, we use the following example. Let us assume a hypothetical firm for which Cash equals about USD 40 million, CFO about USD 25 million, CL about USD 15 million, and TD about 50 million, all values as of 2018. The elasticities are such that, if sales decreased by 50%, Eq. (1) predicts that @CFO would be equal to USD -40 million, whereas Eq. (2) predicts that @CL would be equal to USD -10 million. Hence, after the drop in sales, the cash burn rate would amount to \u00c02.7, the cash flow from operations to current liabilities would be equal to \u00c0300%, and the cash flow-to-debt ratio would be about \u00c030%. Thus, the cash flow from operations would become USD -15 million and current liabilities would amount to USD 5 million. The cash burn rate implies that the firm would have about three years before the accumulated cash holdings are exhausted, assuming that no further debt or equity is issued in the meantime. The cash flow from operations to current liabilities implies that, in the fourth year, current liabilities would increase by three times relative to their level in the third year, to a total of USD 20 million (=USD 5 million \u00c2 (1 + 300%)) if no additional capital were raised. This would pose a liquidity threat to the firm. Alternatively, to avoid a cash crunch, noncurrent liabilities would have to increase by 30% relative to their level in 2018.",

Firms are said to have full operating flexibility if they can quickly adjust to an adverse shock by scaling down production, whereas firms exhibit partial operating flexibility if they face frictions in the ability to adjust. We operationalize this using the estimated elasticities per country b k y to compute @CFO and @CL when we assume full operating flexibility, and b k y divided by two when we assume partial operating flexibility. 13",

We start by downloading the accounting data for all firms incorporated and headquartered in one of the 35 OECD countries, plus China. To draw meaningful inferences from our analyses, we require each country to have at least 50 listed firms. This sample requirement excludes 10 of the 35 OECD member countries. We rely on the International Monetary Fund's website to retrieve exchange rates and to convert each variable into US dollars. Furthermore, we collect the corporate tax rates from the KPMG's Corporate Tax Guide 2018. We exclude financial firms (SIC codes 6000-6999) and firms with negative equity, cash holdings, sales, or total assets. These restrictions result in a sample size of 14,245 unique firms across 26 countries in 2018. Note that all the analyses focus only on the fiscal year 2018, which is also the last reporting period currently available. However, for the variables defined in terms of change, such as change in current assets and change in current liabilities, we also use financial information from the fiscal year 2017. 14 9 In our analyses, we implicitly assume that the financial statement remains that of 2018 for each firm. 10 Banker et al. (2013) employ a similar approach, although their regression model differs slightly from ours, since they focus on cost stickiness. 11 For each country-level regression, we use all firms available from Compustat's Global and North America databases from 2013 to 2018. However, when the variables are defined in terms of change, such as change in current assets and change in current liabilities, we use accounting data for the fiscal years 2012 to 2018. Moreover, before estimating the regression model, we require each country to have at least 50 observations. 12 The average b y across countries ranges from 0.80 for the elasticity of the change in current liabilities to 0.89 for the elasticity of operating costs. The summary statistics of the elasticities are presented in Table A1 of the Internet Appendix. 13 Our methodology is consistent with recent anecdotal evidence, which suggests that several countries have enacted laws that constrain firms from scaling back production during the outbreak of COVID-19 (e.g., by preventing firms from laying off employees). For an overview of policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis, see also OECD (2020b). Moreover, for a similar approach, see Schivardi (2020) . 14 Table A2 of the Internet Appendix presents the sample distributions by country (Panel A) and by industry (Panel B), the latter defined at the one-digit SIC code level.",

In the base case scenario, we find that the average firm would be able to cover about 66% of its current liabilities using cash flow from operations (column (3) of Panel A of Table 2 ). In the moderate-risk scenario, when firms are assumed to have full operating flexibility, they would still be able to cover a portion, albeit smaller, of their current liabilities using cash flow from operations. As shown in column (3) of Panel B in Table 2 , the average cash flow from operations would be positive and would amount to about 4 percentage points of current liabilities. On the other hand, in the high-risk scenario, this ratio would decrease and would become negative (column (3) of Panel C). The ratio of cash flow from operations to current liabilities appears to be more problematic when firms are assumed to have partial flexibility. In both distress scenarios, we find the ratio to be negative, averaging from \u00c0216.01% for the moderate-risk scenario to \u00c0779.26% for the high-risk scenario. This result implies a potential spillover effect that would further magnify the impact of a sales drop on the cash burn rate of suppliers. Furthermore, in Fig. 2 , we plot the distributions of cash flow from operations to current liabilities. In the base case scenario and in both distress scenarios under the assumption of full operating flexibility, firms are distributed on both sides of the density function. On the other hand, under the assumption of partial operating flexibility, we observe that firms are mostly concentrated on the negative side of the density function, lending further support to our previous analyses.",

As shown in Table 2 Fig. 1 . Distributions of the cash burn rate under different distress scenarios and for different levels of operating flexibility. This figure plots the distribution of the cash burn rate for the base case scenario (Panel A) and for each of the two distress scenarios (Panels B and C). Panels B and C plot the distributions of the cash burn rate allowing firms to respond to the shock with full or partial operating flexibility. Appendix C provides the variable definitions. firms in the base case scenario as well as those in the moderate-risk scenario with full operating flexibility would not need to issue additional debt, since their ratio of cash flow from operations to total debt is positive. However, in the other scenarios, we find that, firms would have to increase noncurrent liabilities by about 5.63 (high-risk scenario with full operating flexibility) to 53% (high-risk scenario with partial operating flexibility) to avoid a cash crunch. These results are also consistent with the distributions of cash flow from operations to total debt in Fig. 3 , which are negatively skewed in the high-risk scenario when firms are assumed to have full operating flexibility, and in both distress scenarios when firms are assumed to have partial operating flexibility. Next, we focus on the most illiquid firms with partial operating flexibility and estimate how many would burn through all their cash holdings in just half a year in each of the two possible distress scenarios. We operationalize this by computing the number of firms whose cash burn rate lies between \u00c00.5 and zero. We label these firms as illiquid (i.e., firms with high shortterm liquidity risk). In column (7) of Table 2 , we find that, on average, 717 and 1367 firms would deplete their cash reserves in half a year in the moderate-risk and high-risk scenarios, respectively. 16 To further analyze the characteristics of these (partially flexible) illiquid firms, we conduct two tests, whose results are shown in Table 3 . In Panel A, we present the results of the univariate analysis of key firm characteristics by differentiating between illiquid and liquid firms. The 1367 illiquid firms in the most adverse scenario have a leverage ratio that is, on average, 45% higher than that of the liquid firms. Further, these illiquid firms are smaller, and have, on average, a negative return on assets, in stark contrast with the return on assets of the average liquid firm (i.e., about 3.50%). In sum, these illiquid firms are smaller, less profitable, more levered, and hold a lower percentage of cash relative to total assets compared to their liquid counterparts. 17 In Panel B of Table 3 , we confirm these results by performing a logistic model whose dependent variable (Illiquid) is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if the firm is illiquid, and zero otherwise. We use the firm characteristics from the univariate analysis as determinants of short-term liquidity risk. Furthermore, we include industry fixed effects to absorb industry shocks that could affect the probability of a firm becoming illiquid. We include country fixed effects to ensure that unobservable political and economic conditions do not spuriously drive the results.",

Specifically, we investigate which fiscal measures could be more effective in ameliorating the risk of a COVID-19 cash crunch. We focus on firms assumed to have partial operating flexibility in the moderate-and high-risk scenarios and analyze two policies: a six-month tax deferral and a direct provision of cash to firms as a lump sum akin to a bridge loan granted by the government. Although both measures mitigate short-term liquidity risk, they work in different directions. In particular, the tax deferral decreases a firm's current taxes, whereas the bridge loan increases a firm's cash holdings. 18 To operationalize this, for each illiquid firm in both distress scenarios, we increase either the denominator of the cash burn rate for the amount of a six-month tax deferral or the numerator for the amount of a bridge loan that would adjust the cash burn rate to \u00c00.5. Table 4 presents the results. Columns (1) and (3) show the number of firms that a two-quarter tax deferral would prevent from becoming illiquid within six months. In total, a half-a-year tax deferral would prevent only 14 (27) firms from becoming illiquid within six months in the moderate-risk (high-risk) scenario. On the other hand, columns (5) and (7) assume that the government facilitates a bridge loan to the 717 (1367) illiquid firms in the moderate-risk (high-risk) scenario to shore up all their cash burn rates to \u00c00.5. With respect to the costs of each measure, columns (9) and (10) show that the bridge loan is, on average, twice as costly as a six-month tax deferral. Nevertheless, the bridge loan appears to be more cost-effective than a tax deferral. As shown in columns (2) and (4), on average, 1.8 (one) firms would avoid a cash crunch within six months per USD 1 billion of deferred taxes in the moderate-risk (high-risk) scenario. On the other hand, columns (6) and (8) show that a bridge loan to each firm for the amount necessary to prevent a cash crunch within six months would, on average, save 105.64 (11.67) firms per USD 1 billion loan from becoming illiquid within six months in the moderate-risk (high-risk) scenario. This table compares the absolute number of firms and the number of firms per USD 1 billion invested that would become liquid (cash burn rate lower than \u00c00.5) in the moderate-risk and high-risk scenarios. Firms are assumed to have partial operating flexibility. The policy in columns (1) to (4) consists of a sixmonth tax deferral; in columns (5) to (8), the government grants a bridge loan to each illiquid firm such that the cash burn rate is adjusted to \u00c00.5. Columns (9) and (10) report the extra cost (in percent) to implement the bridge loan policy relative to the tax deferral. Appendix C provides the variable definitions.",

We assume that firms either have full or partial operating flexibility. In the most adverse scenario, and under the assumption of partial operating flexibility, we find that the average firm would exhaust its cash holdings in about two years.
