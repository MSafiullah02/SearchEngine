            "text": "A week after alerting the WHO of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, the Chinese authorities announced on 7 January 2020 that a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of these pneumonia. According to phylogenetic analysis, this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously named 2019-nCoV, belongs to the B lineage of betacoronavirus genus and the sarbecovirus subgenus and has more than 85% nucleotide sequence identity with a bat SARS-like CoV genome published previously [1,2]. Initially described in China, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 rapidly gained ground and evidence of human-to-human transmission rose. On January 30, WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and the disease has now spread worldwide. Highly sensitive and specific tests are crucial to identify and manage COVID-19 patients and implement control measures to limit the outbreak. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in respiratory samples is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection [3,4] However, performing RT-qPCR requires special equipment and skilled laboratory personnel familiar with molecular techniques. Moreover, molecular tests are costly and often time consuming. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip (Coris BioConcept, Gembloux, Belgium) is a dipstick immunochromatographic test designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens in nasopharyngeal secretions within 15 minutes. This rapid test was approved by the belgian Federal Agency of drugs and health products (AFMPS) and included in the first line of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 by the public health institute in Belgium (Sciensano).",

This test, based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticules, uses monoclonal antibodies to detect highly conserved SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antigen. Another monoclonal antibody is conjugate to colloidal gold nanoparticules. These antibodies are immobilized onto the nitrocellulose membrane. The test was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction by mixing 100 \u00b5L of nasopharyngeal secretions with 4 drops (approximately 100 \u00b5L) of LY-S dilution buffer in a tube and the strip was added. When the nasopharyngeal secretions come into contact with the strip, passive diffusion allows the solubilized conjugate to migrate with the sample and react with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies immobilized onto the membrane. A control line is included in the strip to assess the correct migration of the sample. Visual interpretation of the result is performed after 15 minutes. Two versions of the test were evaluated. On the second version, conjugate was coupled on a different way and the control line was optimized.",

            "text": "In the ongoing pandemic context of COVID-19, diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in order to limit the spread of the virus as well as appropriately manage infected patients. Different diagnostic test manufacturers have developed rapid tests based on SARS-CoV-2 proteins detection in respiratory samples. However, the analytical performances of these rapid antigenic tests depend on different factors including the viral load, the quality of the specimen and how it is processed. The performances also depend on the setting of patients tested. Although the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip has several advantages such as the ease and fast achievement of the test, the rapid answer, the lower cost and the non-requirement of special equipment or skills compared with molecular techniques, data presented here suggested that this rapid test is suffering from poor sensitivity. The rapid antigen detection test is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity in nasopharyngeal samples with high viral load equivalent at least to 1.7 \u00d7 105 copies/mL (Ct <25), but the sensitivity declines substantially when the viral load decreases with Ct values over 30, equivalent to 9.4 \u00d7 103 copies/mL, which is often the case in patients suffering of COVID-19. Actually, in our study, while the specificity was 100%, the overall sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip was 30.2%. This lack of sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests for virus detection was already observed during the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic [5]. Ensuring accurate diagnosis is essential to limit the spread of the virus. The poor sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip leads to false negative results, which in these times of pandemic can be of great consequence. This rapid test was thought to be used as a first line COVID-19 diagnostic test in Belgium in order to possibility reduce the number of RT-qPCR testing in case of positive results, but requiring confirmation for negative results. However, because negative results cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, this test is of little use in a pandemic setting. Pending more evidence of their performances, our data suggest that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip should not be used alone for COVID-19 diagnosis and shows no benefit in reducing the use of RT-qPCR.",
