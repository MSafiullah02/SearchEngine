As a result, there has been a need for draconic emergency governmental actions. There is a strong effort to change the behavior of citizens, primarily through social distancing and \"stay at home\" strategies. The effort is to \"flatten the curve\" in order to reduce the public health burdens on the system. While the cause of the disruption was public health, the resulting changes have been gigantic. It is no exaggeration to describe the pandemic as a once-in-a-generation \"black swan\" event (Taleb 2007) in terms of the resulting economic and societal consequences. A comparison of recent \"black swan\" events reveals the uniqueness of the current pandemic. The resulting economic and social phenomenon from social distancing has led to some swift changes in the higher education landscape. Never in our history have entire student bodies been abruptly shifted from face-to-face to remote instruction through the use of digital technologies (Zimmerman 2020) . Faculty members have had to adapt their courses in very short order to meet the moment with very little formal training. The lives of students have been changed in multiple ways, including the loss of internships, dislocations from their homes and campuses, and, the need to learn new technologies in addition to the content area (Govindarajan and Srivastava 2020) .",

Students that were planning careers in these fields might expect long waits or the need to pivot in other directions. Most small to medium businesses have few cash reserves. Despite governmental assistance, this crisis will lead to the bankruptcy of several companies leading to bleak economic prospects for the current batch of graduates.

Business schools are ensuring that students receive instruction during this time. The focus is on finding a way to maintain services during the time of an emergency. During this time, business schools are engaging in \"emergency remote teaching\" (Hodges, Moore, Lockee, Trust and Bond 2020, no page numbers). The excerpt below provides a clear distinction between emergency remote teaching and online learning-In contrast to experiences that are planned from the beginning and designed to be online, emergency remote teaching (ERT) is a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate delivery mode due to crisis circumstances. It involves the use of fully remote teaching solutions for instruction or education that would otherwise be delivered face-to-face or as blended or hybrid courses and that will return to that format once the crisis or emergency has abated. The primary objective in these circumstances is not to re-create a robust educational ecosystem but rather to provide temporary access to instruction and instructional supports in a manner that is quick to set up and is reliably available during an emergency or crisis. When we understand ERT in this manner, we can start to divorce it from \"online learning.\" (Hodges, Moore, Lockee, Trust and Bond, 2020) Importantly, we must recognize that what universities currently face is a short-term effect. It is a stop-gap measure rather than a first-principles design of the instructional experience. During this time, the nature of degrees, the business model used by the college and the curriculum are static. There is simply an attempt to deliver the existing curriculum and programs to the current audiences.",
