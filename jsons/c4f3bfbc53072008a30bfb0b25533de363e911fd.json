As far as in the 1890s, serum immunoglobulin was used to neutralize bacterial virulence [7] . Later, serum therapy was applied to a wide range of other infectious diseases such as meningococcal meningitis, pneumococcal pneumonia, streptococcal scarlet fever, varicella, measles, the pandemic Spanish influenza [15] and Ebola virus disease as well as cytomegalovirus [14, 31] . However, adverse reactions such as serum sickness and anaphylaxis harmed the efficacy of serum therapy [9] . With the discovery of antibiotics, serum therapy in infectious pathogens quickly declined. Antibiotics therapy soon became a mainstay of bacterial infections treatment. However, the success did not last long with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The failure to develop new antibiotics with different mechanisms of actions again trapped patients by the super drug-resistant bacteria. Besides, for individuals with compromised immunity, antimicrobial chemotherapy provides a less effective treatment [28] . Obviously, antibiotics are ineffective at eliminating viruses. The emergence of antibiotics resistance calls for renewed efforts. Among the many options, monoclonal antibody (mAb) may be an alternative, reminiscent of the successful application of antitoxin in fighting against meningococcal meningitis in pre-antibiotic era. Indeed, Nebacumab, the first human therapeutic mAb reviewed by a regulatory agency, was engineered for the treatment of sepsis and gram-negative bacteremia [61] . However, the CHESS (Centocor: HA-1A Efficacy in Septic Shock) trial conducted in the USA which found non-statistically significant increase in mortality between the monoclonal antiendotoxin antibody Nebacumab and placebo groups in patients with gram-negative bacteremia lead to the withdrawal of Nebacumab [20] . Currently, only two humanized antibodies Palivizumab and Raxibacumab are approved for infectious diseases. Many other engineering antibodies against infectious pathogens are under development [2, 5, 16, 45, 67] .
