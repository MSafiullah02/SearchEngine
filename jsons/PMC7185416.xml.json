Different nanofiber morphologies can be obtained via control of the processing conditions to produce beaded as well as smooth and ribbon structures (Fig. 1a-c\n). Recent studies have demonstrated that this technique can also produce nanofibers with core-sheath or hollow12, multichannel tubular13, nanowire-in-microtube14, multi-core cable-like15 and porous16, 17, 18 structures (Fig. 1d-i).",

An ideal fiber diameter is below 20 nm for optimal performances20, however an electrospun fiber from the traditional process typically have a diameter in the range 100-500 nm. The objective is a robust method for manufacturing extremely small nanofibers in large quantities and with a uniform size. Recently, the novel two-dimensional (2D) nanowebs were generated in 3D fibrous mats by optimizing processing parameters in electrospinning21. The electrospun fibers act as a support for the \u2018fishnet-like\u2019 nanowebs comprising interlinked 1D nanowires (Fig. 2a-e\n). The nanowire diameter distribution of nylon-6 nanowebs is shown in Fig. 2f. The major range (over 80%) of nanowire diameters was 10-20 nm with a mean at 17 nm and a standard deviation of 5 nm. The mean diameter of the nanowires contained in typical nanowebs is about one order of magnitude less than that of conventional electrospun fibers. To date, various nanowebs have been successfully prepared using different polymer systems such as nylon-621, polyacrylic acid (PAA)21, 22, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)23 and PAA/nylon-624 (Fig. 2-e). The formation, morphology and area density of the nanowebs in electrospun fibrous membranes are strongly affected by the applied voltage, relative humidity (RH), solvents, solution concentration and distance between the capillary tip and the collector.",

A more surface-confined acoustic wave can be obtained by depositing sensing layers onto the active area of the SAW device. The change in electrical conductivity or mass of the sensing layer perturbs the velocity of SAW due to mechanical and piezoelectric effects. Concentrated efforts have been focused on depositing nanostructured coatings on SAW via electrospray or electrospinning techniques to improve the sensor sensitivity27, 28. For example, He et al.\n28 demonstrated that a sensor for H2 could be prepared by electrospinning deposition of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)/LiTaO3 composite nanofibers on the electrodes of SAW.",

The QCM as an analytical tool is able to detect very tiny mass changes of even less than a nanogram deposited on crystal surface. Recent efforts have been focused on the development of nanostructured coatings on QCM to improve sensor sensitivities30, 31. Taking the advantages of large specific surface area, high porosity and good interconnectivity of the electrospun fibrous assemblies, NH3\n30, 32, H2S33, formaldehyde34 and moisture22 have been successfully detected under more challenging conditions at the room temperature in flow-type (Fig. 4a\n) or static-type gas testing systems (Fig. 4c) by measuring the resonance frequency shifts of QCM caused by the additional mass loading. The PAA nanofibers coated QCM sensors exhibited ultra-high sensitivity towards very low concentrations of NH3, such as 130 ppb at the RH of 40%32 (Fig. 4b). Additionally, a humidity sensor was fabricated by electrospinning deposition a network of PAA nanowebs on a QCM22. The fibrous coatings produce a response increased by more than two orders of magnitude as RH increases from 6 to 95% (Fig. 4d). The sensitivity of the fibrous membranes coated QCM sensors was several times higher than that of the flat films coated QCM sensors. These experiments have demonstrated the possibility of using electrospinning technique to regulate structures of membrane for higher surface activity and gas sensitivity. More experiments using more complex arrangements and structures of fibers are expected to expand the capabilities of this platform in the future.",

Many attempts have been taken to prepare ultrasensitive resistive sensors to detect NH3, H2S, CO, NO2, O2, CO2, moisture and volatile organic compounds vapors with new detection limits using electrospun nanofibers functionalized MOS such as TiO2, ZnO, WO3, MoO3, SnO2, In2O3 and ITO35, 36, 37, 38, 39. Among MOS, TiO2 have been the most popular candidate used in ultrasensitive resistive sensors. Kim et al.\n19 have demonstrated the use of nanofibers functionalized TiO2 as detectors for NO2. Li et al.\n40 demonstrated the fabrication of LiCl-doped TiO2 nanofibers via electrospinning as the humidity sensors (Fig. 5\n). They prepared a solution of tetrabutyltitanate, LiCl, and PVP in ethanol and acetic for electrospinning, followed by calcination to obtain TiO2/LiCl composite nanofibers (Fig. 5a). The as-prepared humidity sensor based on the LiCl-doped TiO2 nanofibers exhibited greatly improved sensitivity compared to the pure TiO2 nanofibers. Additionally, the composite nanofibers also exhibited an ultra-fast response and recovery behavior (Fig. 5b). Recently, SnO2 nanostructures have also received much attention due to their high transparency, wide-bandgap semi-conductivity, and huge magnetooptic and chemical-sensing effects41, 42. SnO2 nanofibers exhibit an electrical resistance sensitive to harmful chemical gases or vapors, such as ammonia43, methanol44, ethanol45, 46, toluene47 and moisture48. Ultrasensitive detection of analytes in air with semiconducting metal-oxide resistive nanofiber chemiresistors provided one of the most impressive demonstrations of nanoelectronic sensing to date and has clear implications for the future environmental pollution monitoring devices. Given the distinct properties of these wide-band semiconductor materials possess, it is easy to envision them as a basis for a future generation of non-intrusive highly efficient and extremely sensitive multifunctional electronic devices.",

Recently, Shi and coworkers60 have developed a method to fabricate Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) embedded silica nanofibers via electrospinning and thermal decomposition of hybrid nanofibers, which exhibited an obvious photoelectric response under the illumination (Fig. 6a\n). Upon illumination, the hybrid peapod nanofibers presented a wavelength-dependent photoelectric current response. In particular, the current photoresponse reached a maximum value under illumination at a wavelength of 550 nm, which was close to the SPR absorption band of the AuNPs nanofibers (Fig. 6b). These results showed the potential of using gold nanopeapodded silica nanowires as wavelength-controlled optical nanoswitches.",

Considering the distinguished optical and electric performance, electrospun GaN nanofibers are suitable for ultraviolet photodetection applications. Pan and coworkers61 demonstrated that electrospun GaN nanofibers were promising candidates for easily assembled high-performance UV photodetectors (Fig. 6c). The photoconductance of an electrospun GaN nanofiber increases by 830 times compared with single crystalline GaN nanowires when UV was on. This high sensitivity can be attributed to the polycrystalline structure and rough surfaces of GaN nanofibers, which lead to a high surface area-to-volume ratio, and subsequently result in more photogenerated carriers compared with a smooth GaN nanowire. Besides high sensitivity, the electrospun GaN nanofiber UV sensor also showed advantages in response speed and reversibility as seen in Fig. 6d.",

Owing to the intriguing stress-induced chromic transition and nonlinear optical properties, polydiacetylene supramolecules (PDAs) have been extensively investigated as potential chemosensors and photonic materials. Chae et al.\n64 have demonstrated the feasibility of PDA-embedded electrospun microfibers as potential sensor materials by detecting the fluorescence generation upon specific ligand-receptor interactions (Fig. 7b-d). Incubation of the porous PMMA microfibers, containing embedded polymerized PCDA, in an \u03b1-cyclodextrin (\u03b1-CD) solution (10 mM) resulted in the generation of red fluorescence (Fig. 7d), however, much weaker fluorescence signals arose from fibers treated with \u03b2- and \u03b3-CD.",

            "text": "The manufacturing of structured yet compact polymer fibers with diameters from submicrometer to 10 nm meets with considerable interests for various kinds of applications. The reduction of diameter into nanometers gives rise to a set of favorable properties, including increase of surface-to-volume ratio, unique electronic properties, and simple integration with two-terminal microcircuits, which will further enhance the sensitivity of the sensor. Craighead and coworkers50 investigated the diameter-dependent response of single PANI upon exposure to NH3. The PANI nanowires with two different diameters (335 and 490 nm) were fabricated and their sensitive properties were examined. As a result, the electrical response of single PANI nanowire sensors depended on the vapor concentration as well as the nanowire diameter. Both the response time and the sensitivity were greatly improved with the decrease of diameter. Therefore, a smaller diameter leads to a faster response due to more rapid diffusion of gas molecules through the nanowire.",

With regard to mass sensing technique, a thicker nanofibrous membrane has a larger sensing area and vacant volume in which more analytes can be absorbed and diffuse into the membranes. We demonstrated that the nanofibrous PAA membranes coated QCM sensors with a larger coating load exhibited a larger frequency response for the same RH22. For resistive sensors, increased interaction of the analyte with the conduction channel is of importance, as the sensitivity and response time ultimately depend on the analyte transport to this region. It may be possible that a thicker semiconductor or conducting polymer layer could protect the conduction pathway from the deleterious effects of environment as well as analytes of interest. Wang et al.\n84 demonstrated how ultrathin PPy membranes influenced the sensor characteristics. The high sensitivity and fast recovery time can be attributed to the ultrathin PPy-coating layer (\u223c7 nm), in which the ultrathin PPy layer greatly reduces the diffusion resistance of NH3. Nevertheless, the dependence of sensing performance on nanofibrous membranes thickness has not been clearly established for resistive sensors85.",
