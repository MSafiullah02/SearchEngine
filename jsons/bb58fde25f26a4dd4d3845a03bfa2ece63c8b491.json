This may be accomplished Because of the previously described problems of by viral culture, detection of viral antigens in respirviral lability and low titres in secretions, new molecatory secretions, molecular techniques or serology. ular techniques that detect very small amounts of RSV can be detected in a variety of respiratory viral RNA by amplification are currently regarded secretions including nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal as the optimal method of diagnosis of acute RSV washes, sputum or bronchial alveolar lavage fluinfection.

Although sensitive and 99% specific, whereas viral culture was 39% sensispecific, serology based on IgG is limited by the tive and 100% specific.
