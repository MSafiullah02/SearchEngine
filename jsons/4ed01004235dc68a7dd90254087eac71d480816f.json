Multivariable logistic regression models measured the association between patient age/comorbidity burden as measured by Charlson-Deyo index, 3 and the outcomes of ICU admission and ventilation, to validate the perception that younger and healthier patients are less likely to require these resources.",

These patients are not only less likely to require ICU or ventilation, but they are also at lower risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms were they to contact the virus during their hospital stay. 4 However, if patients do not meet these criteria and their health could worsen from delaying surgery, it may be advisable to instead space out surgeries of older patients with underlying conditions to optimize resource utilization.",
