Noncoding RNA (ncRNA) molecules are increasingly recognized as key regulatory players of biological processes3, 4 in which they participate based on their three\u2010dimensional structure rather than sequence. With their well\u2010defined structure, ncRNA folds provide potentially unique interaction sites for selective small\u2010molecule ligands that affect the RNAs\u2019 biological function. Outside the bacterial ribosome, untranslated RNA regions as drug targets have been pursued to discover therapeutics for viral infections including those caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)5 and hepatitis C virus (HCV).6 These pathogens have single\u2010stranded RNA genomes which include structured noncoding regions that play key roles in the viral infection cycle and harbor potential binding sites for small molecule inhibitors. The high conservation of untranslated regions in viral genomes along with the absence of homologous host cell RNAs render structured viral regulatory RNAs attractive targets for the development of novel antiinfective drugs.7, 8\n",

Therefore, structural and physicochemical properties of small molecule ligands for RNA differ markedly from drugs targeting proteins.9 Clinically used RNA\u2010binding antibiotics are derived from natural products which, on average, are structurally more complex, more hydrophilic, and contain a larger number of hydrogen bond donors compared to drug\u2010like compounds.10 These molecular properties create challenges in reconciling the design and optimization of RNA\u2010binding ligands with drug\u2010like features affecting absorption and distribution in vivo. Strategies for the design and discovery of RNA\u2010binding ligands have been outlined long before the rise of ncRNA,11, 12, 13 and comprehensive reviews on targeting RNA with small molecules have been published regularly over the last years.14, 15, 16 Among the chemically diverse classes of RNA binders,9 recurring scaffolds are found among derivatives of aminoglycosides and planar intercalators including acridine and phenothiazine (Figure 1).",

Aminoglycosides and their semi\u2010synthetic derivatives have been reported to promiscuously bind numerous ncRNA targets9, 14, 15 including regulatory elements from HIV, which over two decades ago were the first viral RNAs to be investigated for small\u2010molecule inhibition.18, 19, 20 It has been suggested that aminoglycosides bind to RNA folds through structural electrostatic complementarity whereby positively charged ammonium groups of the ligand recognize metal\u2010ion\u2010binding pockets created by the RNA architecture.21, 22 Similarly, promiscuous binding to structured RNA has been observed for intercalating compounds which contain flat aromatic scaffolds such as acridine, phenazine and phenothiazine derivatives. While early ligand\u2010binding studies of ncRNA focused on proof of concept and often involved promiscuous binders including aminoglycosides and intercalators, more recently, considerations of compounds\u2019 drug\u2010likeness have been prominently included in RNA targeting efforts.

Formation of the Tat/TAR complex stimulates transcription elongation to yield full\u2010length transcripts by a complex mechanism that also involves host cell factors.34 The Tat\u2010binding site in TAR consists of a conserved RNA stem\u2010loop with a pyrimidine\u2010rich bulge (Figure 2) which is conformationally dynamic but adopts a stable, ordered structure in complex with Tat peptide, and small molecule ligands. Disruption of the Tat/TAR complex by competing ligands binding to the RNA target blocks efficient HIV replication and was recognized early as a potential path to the development of antiviral drugs.19, 30, 34 Numerous studies have focused on the discovery and design of TAR RNA\u2010binding inhibitors, including peptides, natural products such as aminoglycosides and synthetic small molecules.

A counter\u2010screen was applied against an unrelated RNA hairpin to exclude promiscuous binders. The SMM screen returned a low hit rate of 0.02%, excelled with a low false\u2010positive rate, and eventually delivered a confirmed hit compound (1, Table 2) with reasonable drug\u2010like properties, anti\u2010HIV activity in T\u2010lymphoblasts (EC50 value of 28 \u03bcM), as well as low cytotoxicity. The thienopyridine derivative 1 is surprisingly hydrophobic for an RNA\u2010binding ligand and similar chemotypes have not been reported before as TAR\u2010binders. It remains to be seen if the potency of thienopyridine derivatives can be improved to furnish lead candidates for the development of antiviral drugs targeting the HIV TAR. Nevertheless, the SMM screening approach has proven to be a promising method for the discovery of drug\u2010like ligands for RNA and fruitful application to other ncRNA targets is expected.",

A fluorimetric competition assay (Box 2) was used to determine ligand binding by testing for the ability of a compound to displace a dye\u2010labeled Tat peptide from a TAR model RNA. Seven small molecules from the screening set were found to compete with Tat peptide binding at TAR with IC50 values between 40 and 70 \u03bcM, including the quinazoline 2 shown as an example in Table 2 (IC50 value of 60 \u03bcM). At least two of the hit compounds had been identified previously as inhibitors of Tat/TAR complex formation and were shown to downregulate Tat transactivation in a cell\u2010based assay.30 While cellular activity was not tested in the fragment screening approach reported by G\u00f6bel et al., one\u2010dimensional 1H NMR was used to confirm ligand interaction with the RNA target by monitoring changes in imino\u2010proton signals upon titration with compound. As a consequence of the composition bias of the screening set with small molecules rich in hydrogen bond donors, the hit compounds tended to exceed the number of hydrogen bond donors of typical drug\u2010like molecules. However, fragment incorporation for construction of larger ligands in the future would reduce the number of hydrogen bond donor sites.",

As a consequence of the design paradigm focusing on a scaffold for nucleobase\u2010like interaction, the resulting compounds were hydrophilic and carried a larger number of hydrogen bond donor groups. Ligands of the TAR element were identified by monitoring fluorescent changes upon compound titration to a terminally dye\u2010labeled TAR model oligonucleotide (Box 2). S nucleobase conjugates of arginine, lysine, and histidine were found to tightly bind the TAR RNA. However, only the histidine derivative 3 (Table 2) was a selective TAR binder (K\nd = 17 \u03bcM) whose affinity for the target was not diminished in the presence of other nucleic acids. The arginine and lysine conjugates showed better interaction with TAR RNA (K\nd = 2.4 and 7.5 \u03bcM, respectively) but binding was promiscuous and strongly affected by the presence of competitor nucleic acids. Perhaps attesting to a correlation of target selectivity and biological activity, only the histidine derivative 3 showed antiviral activity in HIV\u2010infected human cells (IC50 = 0.41 \u03bcM). It is not clear why the viral inhibition potency of 3 exceeds the target binding affinity by 40\u2010fold. This finding suggests, however, that compound 3 may act on other targets in addition to the TAR RNA.",

Clomiphene (4), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, inhibited Rev peptide binding to RRE SL\u2010IIB with an IC50 value of 3.5 \u03bcM and had antiviral activity with an EC50 value of 4.3 \u03bcM in the cell\u2010based assay.

Interaction of clomiphene (4) was highly specific for the RRE SL\u2010IIB target while target binding of cyproheptadine (5) was significantly compromised in the presence of competitor tRNA or DNA. NMR spectroscopic studies revealed the G\u2010rich internal loop in the lower stem of SL\u2010IIB as the interaction site for 4 and 5, which overlaps with the binding region of Rev and is consistent with the proposed mechanism of inhibition by ligand competition.

The unique role of the viral IRES and its high conservation in clinical isolates has led to recognition of this ncRNA as a potential drug target.60, 61 High throughput screening of over 200,000 compounds for inhibition of IRES function in cell\u2010based reporter translation assays led to the discovery of phenazine derivatives62 and biaryl guanidines63 which had moderate selectivity for the viral translation target. While the structures of compounds from these chemical series suggest that they may interact with the IRES RNA, target binding or antiviral activity were not reported in these early studies. An important breakthrough was achieved by Seth and colleagues who used mass spectrometry\u2010based screening of 180,000 compounds to identify 2\u2010aminobenzimidazole derivatives as ligands binding the internal loop RNA of subdomain IIa in the HCV IRES (Figure 4(a)).41 Lead optimization driven by structure\u2010activity relationship data furnished compound 6 (Table 3) which had an affinity of 0.9 \u03bcM (K\nd) for the IRES target (determined by mass spectrometry) and inhibited HCV in cell culture with an EC50 value of 3.9 \u03bcM while showing no cytotoxicity up to 100 \u03bcM concentration.41 Mechanism of action studies of 2\u2010aminobenzimidazoles revealed that these compounds act as allosteric inhibitors of an RNA conformational switch in the IRES subdomain IIa.40 In contrast to metabolite\u2010sensing riboswitches, the HCV IRES subdomain IIa motif is representative of a new class of RNA conformational switches that are structurally well\u2010defined in both ligand\u2010free and bound states and may represent the simplest form of ligand\u2010responsive, purely mechanical switches in nucleic acids.64\n",

Moreover, construction of the pyran ring in 6 required a lengthy synthetic route that hampered a deep exploration of this chemical series.41, 67 We have recently designed second generation ligands for the guanosine binding pocket in the HCV IRES subdomain IIa target which address the shortcomings of the original 2\u2010aminobenzimidazole derivatives. In an approach to maintain the nonplanarity of benzimidazole ligands, which is introduced by the sp3 carbon centers in the pyran ring of ligands such as 6, we have designed N1\u2010coupled aryl derivatives represented by compound 7. Sterical hindrance of the N1 aryl substituent induces a twisted conformation with an overall nonplanar shape of the resulting compounds.44 In another set of analogs, we have replaced the basic imidazole ring in the first generation ligands with the less basic oxazole system.45 The resulting ligands, exemplified by compound 8, were accessible through straightforward synthetic routes and displayed good drug\u2010like properties. However, none of the synthesized N1\u2010coupled aryl benzimidazoles44 or oxazole derivatives45 had an affinity for the IIa RNA superior to the original 2\u2010aminobenzimidazoles. The best ligands in the new compound series showed EC50 values for target binding of 74\u2013120 \u03bcM.44, 45 A computational molecular dynamics (MD) study of 2\u2010aminobenzimidazoles in complex with the IRES IIa RNA inspired the design of tetracyclic dipyrroloindoles which were proposed as rigid, less basic ligand candidates.68 However, synthesis or testing of the in silico designed compounds was not reported. The structural plasticity of the HCV IRES subdomain IIa illustrates the challenges facing computational approaches for RNA targets in general. Large conformational changes in the IIa RNA target upon ligand binding, accompanied by extensive rearrangement of base stacking, were unexpected and likely beyond the predictive ability of current computational approaches. The relative success of MD studies reproducing the conformational rearrangement and benzimidazole ligand binding of the IIa RNA68, 69 may be attributed to the fact that experimental waypoints in the form of high\u2010resolution crystal structures were available to guide the calculations. Challenges of large conformational changes in RNA targets are compounded by the dominant electrostatic interactions in the anionic polymer and concurrent impact of counter\u2010ion binding and hydration,70 which are recognized as the Achilles\u2019 heel of computational approaches for RNA.71\n",

Translational frameshifting is triggered by the interplay of two RNA motifs which include a slippery sequence where the reading frame change occurs, followed by a structured region that stalls the ribosome. The structured frameshift motif in HIV consists of a long RNA hairpin with an internal loop, which has been explored in ligand targeting approaches that were aimed at stabilizing or disrupting the RNA fold. Earlier studies on the HIV target have been discussed in recent comprehensive reviews by Le Grice, Brakier\u2010Gingras, and coworkers.5, 33 In SARS CoV, translation of viral proteins required for replication including the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase is initiated by a \u22121 programmed frameshift which is triggered by a three\u2010stemmed RNA PK (Figure 5).76, 77\n",

Efficiency of frameshifting is not determined by thermodynamic stability of the PK or impact on ribosomal pausing but rather by the ability of the RNA fold to adopt alternate conformations and structures.78 Therefore, ligand binding may affect translational frameshifting through a complex mechanism that only partially relies on stabilization of the PK RNA. For some of the previously identified inhibitors of HIV translational \u22121 frameshifting, it has been suggested that their promiscuous RNA\u2010binding ability may affect ribosomal RNA rather than the viral genomic frameshifting signal.33 Interaction with multiple targets may play a role for the inhibitory action of 10 as well, which may account for the over 450\u2010fold higher potency of this compound as a frameshifting inhibitor in a cell\u2010based assay47 compared to its RNA binding affinity.50\n",

Investigations of the RNA promoter structure by NMR revealed a bifurcated interaction of a uracil base hydrogen bonding with two consecutive adenine residues in the opposite strand.83 This motif in conjunction with a neighboring noncanonical AoC base pair induces widening of the major groove of the RNA promoter helix near the polymerase initiation site. Since unique structural features introduced by internal loops and noncanonical base pairs have previously been shown to provide ligand recognition sites in duplex RNA, it is conceivable that selective compound binding to the influenza A RNA promoter might interfere with polymerase interaction and prevent viral replication. Inhibitors that interfere with viral gene expression by binding to the RNA promoter would provide a novel mechanism of action for the development of anti\u2010influenza drugs.

Ligand binding is observed in a widened RNA major groove at the internal loop formed by the bifurcated U < A/A motif. The NMR model of the promoter complex suggests that 11 interacts with the RNA target mainly by contacts of the methoxy substituents which are positioned closely to residues of the internal loop motif (Figure 6(c)). The researchers point out that methoxy group protons in 11 are within hydrogen bonding distance to A11, A12, G13, and C22.48 Hydrogen bond formation involving carbon\u2010attached donors interacting with oxygen (CH\u22efO) and nitrogen (CH\u22efN) acceptors is unusual but has precedent in biomolecular structures.85, 86 While such interactions are weak and may be rare in small molecule recognition of RNA folds, CH\u22efO hydrogen bonds involving an aryl\u2010methoxy donor have been observed contributing to binding of a 6\u2010O\u2010methylguanine ligand in crystal structures of purine riboswitches.87 For several natural product antibiotics that contain aryl\u2010methoxy groups, including anisomycin and puromycin,9 crystal structures of ribosome\u2010bound complexes are available.

The repertoire of drug targets may be expanded by targeting structured RNA elements in the genomes and transcripts of viral pathogens. In this review, I have discussed recent progress in the discovery of small molecule\u2010targeting approaches directed at structured RNA motifs in the genomes of HIV, HCV, SARS CoV, and influenza A, which represent a variety of virus families. Regulatory sequences in viral genomes and transcripts stand out for their conservation in clinical isolates which promise a high barrier to resistance development against inhibitors targeting these structured RNA elements. Nevertheless, criteria of drugability have to be thoughtfully applied to select RNA targets for small molecules in the development of novel antiviral therapies. Such considerations are more important than ever in light of an unprecedented surge of new ncRNA species emerging as key participants in biological processes.4 Structurally well\u2010defined, deep and solvent\u2010excluded ligand binding pockets are rare in RNA folds but provide the most promising opportunities for discovery of drug\u2010like inhibitors on par with drugs targeting viral proteins. Among the viral RNA motifs discussed here, the HCV IRES subdomain IIa perhaps best embodies such advantageous characteristics of a drug target, but is also unique with respect to its function as a conformational switch that harbors a proper ligand binding pocket. Similar RNA switch motifs have been discovered in over 10 other flavi\u2010 and picornaviruses,64 however, none of which rise to a level of threat as a human pathogen comparable to HCV.

A variety of potential drug targets in structured RNA elements is also found in filoviruses, which include the etiologic agents of Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Replication of these negative\u2010sense RNA viruses relies on a structured RNA promoter element that consists of a large hairpin involving nucleotides 1\u201355 in the 5\u2032 terminus of the viral genome whose secondary structure has been established by chemical probing.98, 99 The 3\u2032 terminus of the filovirus genome does not interact with the 5\u2032 end, unlike in the RNA promoter of influenza A virus which also has a negative\u2010sense ssRNA genome. Filovirus genomes consist of a nonsegmented RNA that encodes reading frames for seven structural proteins which are separated by long intergenic regions (IGR). The IGR between virus proteins VP30 and VP24 has been suggested to fold into a two\u2010armed stem\u2010loop structure that includes a complex RNA four\u2010way junction.101 Transcription of viral genes involves the VP30 nucleocapsid protein as an anti\u2010termination factor that binds to a hairpin loop at the transcription start site.102, 103 Viral transcripts have long 5\u2032 UTR elements that derive from the IGR and contain hairpin loop structures which may play a role in transcriptional regulation and translational control.109 Examples of attractive RNA targets for ligand inhibition are also found in DNA viruses. Among them is the oncogenic Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) which is a common cause of malignancies in AIDS patients. Translation of the viral homolog of the FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP), a key player involved in KSHV\u2010induced tumorigenesis,110 is initiated at an IRES element that adopts a complex RNA secondary structure including a conserved segment of 252 nucleotides.104, 111 Functional and chemical probing analysis of the vFLIP IRES revealed an independently folding RNA core domain linked to flexibly linked hairpin motifs which provide several structurally well\u2010defined sites for ligand targeting.106 KSHV also encodes a 1077 nucleotide polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) ncRNA, which is the most abundant transcript produced from the viral genome during lytic replication.107 PAN RNA is essential for viral propagation, and its accumulation relies on posttranscriptional stabilization involving a cis\u2010acting RNA motif which acts as an enhancer of nuclear retention element (ENE).112 The ENE is a 79 nucleotide motif in the PAN 3\u2032 terminus which sequesters in cis the PAN poly(A) tail in a unique triple helix structure that protects the ncRNA from decay and leads to accumulation of PAN.113 Both, the ENE hairpin structure, which contains a uridine\u2010rich, large internal loop, and the ENE\u2010poly(A) triple helix complex are potential targets for small molecule ligands that may interfere with KSHV replication. One final example for a tractable RNA target in a DNA virus is the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) which serves as an intermediate template in viral replication through reverse transcription.114 Prior to reverse transcription, the HBV pgRNA is sequestered together with polymerase into subviral particles. Both encapsidation and initiation of reverse transcriptase require a conserved sequence in the 5\u2032 terminal region of the pgRNA which folds into a stem loop structure with a uridine\u2010rich internal loop referred to as the epsilon encapsidation signal.108, 115, 116, 117 While small molecule ligands of this RNA motif have not been reported yet, RNA decoys of the epsilon sequence have been developed that sequester reverse transcriptase, which provided proof\u2010of\u2010principle that disruption of the pgRNA\u2010polymerase interaction suppresses HBV replication.118\n",
