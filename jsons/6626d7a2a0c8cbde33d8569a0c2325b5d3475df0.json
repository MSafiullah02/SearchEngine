It is thus suggested that modulators of the RAAS system may be therapeutic targets against SARS-CoV-2. The findings of current trials using ARBs as well as early phase 2B trials using intravenous recombinant human ACE2 may provide further evidence to support the suggestions of Bombardini et.al. (4) ",

            "text": "The recent publication by Bombardini et.al. suggests an important role of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with underlying infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. (1) The complex interplay between the angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE)/ACE2 pathways in the development of ARDS is supported by extensive literature. This is further highlighted by Bombardini et.al. in their article describing the translational mechanisms behind lung injury in patients with SARS-CoV-2. (1) We however contest the suggestion made by the authors regarding the presence of increased levels of ACE2 expression in patients with underlying hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Previous work on both animal and human models have in fact suggested otherwise. (2,3) There is still however an imbalance as suggested by the authors in favour of the vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic ACE/AngiotensinII(ATII)/Angiotensin type 1 receptor(AT1R) pathway in comparison to the counterregulatory ACEII/Angiotensin 1-7/Angiotensin type 2 receptor pathway. This may explain the development of severe acute lung injury in these group of high risk patients when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Hypertensive and diabetic patients who are treated with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may however express increased levels of ACE2 on cell surface membranes. Whether this necessarily translates into increased coronavirus viral load or disease severity is still not known. (4) It has rather been suggested, that despite increasing ACE2 levels, ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may rather play a protective role. ACE-I by reducing the conversion of ATI to ATII and ARBs, by reducing the binding of ATII to AT1R (and preferably binding AT2R) may tilt the scale suggested by Bombardini et.al. in favour of a protective ACE2-signaling pathway.",
