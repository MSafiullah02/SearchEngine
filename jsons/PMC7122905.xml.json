            "text": "The discovery of endogenous proteins that regulate hematopoiesis led to the identification of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, it became possible to manufacture bioactive recombinant proteins for medicinal use. Since the approval of recombinant human G-CSF (rHuG-CSF), such as filgrastim in 1991 and pegfilgrastim in 2002, millions of patients at risk for severe myelosuppression have received these products. Overall, filgrastim and pegfilgrastim have a high margin of safety for short-term use; however, rare severe adverse events have emerged and questions remain regarding the long-term safety and consequences of use of these products. This chapter primarily focuses on the safety and adverse event profile of the most widely used commercially available rHuG-CSF, Neupogen (filgrastim) and Neulasta [a modified (pegylated) filgrastim, pegfilgrastim]. As safety information can change rapidly, we suggest readers consult the latest package inserts for any changes that have occurred from the time of this writing. Other chapters in this volume discuss key studies in specific disease settings in greater detail than is the purview of this chapter, and we encourage the interested reader to reference them for further information.",

As a result of extensive investigations, filgrastim is approved for prevention and treatment of severe neutropenia in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. It is also approved for use in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are undergoing induction or consolidation chemotherapy, and in patients who are receiving myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation. Filgrastim is also approved, used to treat patients with chronic forms of neutropenia such as idiopathic neutropenia, congenital neutropenia, and cyclic neutropenia.",

The focus of research turned to discovery of ways to abrogate the neutropenia, as well as anemia and thrombocytopenia, of high-dose chemotherapy. Bone marrow transplantations, both autologous and allogeneic, were first steps, but with the advent of hematopoietic growth factors, the utility of filgrastim in mobilizing PBPC for reinfusion after ablative therapy became apparent. Collection of PPBC is inherently less hazardous than harvesting of bone marrow and there was hope that reinfusion of PBPC would be without tumor contamination.",

In a phase 3 study, 123 patients with documented severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 \u00d7 109/L were randomly assigned to receive filgrastim or to undergo a 4-month observation period followed by treatment with filgrastim [45].

In rare cases, the use of these drugs has caused fatal splenic rupture and other rare but serious side effects but overall the benefit of these products has clearly outweighed the risks and has contributed to the survival of millions of cancer patients. The success of these products is an important contribution in the overall supportive care of patients receiving chemotherapy for life-threatening cancers.
