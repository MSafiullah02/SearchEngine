Six weeks after enrollment, end-of-study samples identical to enrollment samples were collected, and each participant completed a questionnaire of symptoms experienced during training.

These sites included toilet handles, sink handles, bedposts on the left and right side of each room, pillows, drinking fountains, clothing lockers on the left and right side of each room, and rifles. Samples were collected using the same type of swabs and VTM as those used for participants. In each squad bay, a random selection of 4 different representative surfaces for each of the chosen sites was sampled daily, to avoid comprehensive \u201ccleaning\u201d of the sites. For example, 15 toilet handles were present in the bathrooms of each squad bay.

The second sample was collected on a commercially available electrostatic air-filtration system (Ionic Breeze Quadra, model SI637; Sharper Image). The DFU operated for 12 h daily, during the evening, night, and early morning hours, when recruits were present. Two polyester filters (DFU-P-24; Lockheed Martin) were used in each DFU. Each morning, both filters were removed from the DFU. One was stored in 20 mL of 1\u00d7 PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for molecular testing, and the other was stored in 2.5 mL of VTM for growth in cell cultures.

Although it is beyond the scope of the present article, a thorough description of this technology has been presented elsewhere [13]. Briefly, the TIGER technology uses broad polymerase chain reaction (PCR) priming teamed with determination of base composition of the resultant amplicons by electrospray ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometer analysis (ESI-TOF). These resulting base compositions can be used to identify and characterize the nature of the pathogen(s) present in relevant samples. Genomic DNA was prepared using the QiaAmp Virus BioRobot MDx kit (Qiagen). After broad PCR amplification designed to identify the presence of adenovirus in the sample and the specific identity of a number of specific serotypes, the samples were desalted and then subjected to ESI-TOF mass-spectrometer analysis. Signal processing of the mass-spectrometry data then determined the quantity of PCR product, which is reported as the \u201ccalibrated amplitude\u201d (the estimated number of input genomes) for each primer set",

Since the loss of the adenovirus vaccines, this serotype has caused >98% of all captured adenoviral FRIs among US military recruits [12, 16]. During historical effectiveness studies of the oral Ad-4 vaccines in the late 1960s, it was found that, once this serotype was controlled with vaccination, Ad-7 quickly filled the niche [25]. For this reason, current efforts to resume vaccine production are following the historical precedent; both Ad-4 and Ad-7 are being included in the vaccine formulations. In this new era, the demonstration that >79% of incoming recruits may be vulnerable to Ad-4 or Ad-7 infection is critical information. This is similar to historic rates of seroprevalence at matriculation that were documented during the 1960s [26] and 1990s [27]. Likewise, the clear demonstration that antibody titers are protective is important. All recruits with captured Ad-4\u2013positive FRI had enrollment anti\u2013Ad-4 titers of <1:4. Historically, this was less clearly demonstrated, with at least some individuals with demonstrable titers developing febrile adenoviral illness during outbreaks [26]. The ultimate cost for the adenovirus vaccines currently under development is unclear; however, they will likely be significantly more expensive than those of previous decades. For cost savings and the alleviation of unnecessary vaccination, serological testing is being considered in our recruit camps to guide vaccination efforts for most required vaccines. The present data would support such a policy for the oral adenovirus vaccines",
