To this end, lung recruitment maneuvers have been under investigation over the past two decades [2\u20136]. To date, despite numerous studies, no clear definition of the optimal inflation duration, nor of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) optimal level exists. According to current knowledge on the respiratory transition at birth [7], sustained inflation (SI) aerates the fluid-filled lungs homogeneously during the initial fetal-neonatal transition phase, and thereafter, adequate PEEP helps to maintain the fluid in the interstitial tissue.",

Despite encouraging results such as a reduced need for intubation, no benefit was found for reduction of mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, studies in the premature lamb have shown better oxygenation, lung mechanics, and end-expiratory global lung volume after a dynamic PEEP strategy based on a step-by-step PEEP increase far beyond 5 cmH2O compared with a nonoptimized SI strategy [4, 6]. However, none of these differences were observed when the dynamic PEEP strategy was compared with a SI strategy optimized by real time electrical impedance tomography for the duration of the inflation [5]. We hypothesized that individualized LR maneuvers combining dynamic PEEP and gradually extended SI, as needed, would lower the incidence of mechanical ventilation (MV) in the first 72 h, without increasing neonatal complications. To this end, we retrospectively compared short-term and before discharge outcomes, before and after introducing LR maneuvers in very low gestational age infants (VLGAI) < 32 weeks of gestation and especially in the subgroup of extremely low gestational age infants (ELGAI) < 29 weeks of gestation, with higher morbidity and mortality rates.",

In the 2014/2015 period, the respiratory assistance of VLGAI was conducted according to international recommendations (PEEP of 5 cm H2O, inflation duration of 2\u20133 s, peak inspiratory pressure of 20\u201325 cmH2O) using a face mask with a T-piece resuscitator (Neopuff, Fisher & Paykel, Auckland, New-Zealand), followed by intubation if the baby remained apneic or cyanotic with a pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 75% at 5 min of life whatever the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), or with a heart rate (HR) < 100/min or an FiO2 > 0.4 at 10 min of life in order to achieve an SpO2 > 85%. During 2016, respiratory support was changed to gradual increase in inflations duration (from 3 to 5, to 10, then 15 s), as needed, and performed with a simultaneous increase in PEEP every 1 to 2 SI from 5 to 8, 10, 12, then 15 cmH2O, according to the clinical response, which included persistent bradycardia, apnea or gasping. A gradual decrease in PEEP was performed when FiO2 reached 0.4, while SIs were stopped when regular spontaneous breathing was observed. In case of severe asphyxia, emergency intubation with or without chest compressions did not cancel the LR strategy. During both periods, the resuscitation team included at least a neonatologist, a pediatric resident, and a midwife. The team member at the head of each newborn kept track of the titrating of SIs by counting aloud each duration, and announcing the PEEP level set at the PEEP cap located on the T-piece. The PIP level which was not modified with the PEEP level, was eventually increased by turning the ad-hoc knob by the team member closest to it.\n",

The synchronized mode was used in case of hypercapnia or moderate apnea despite caffeine treatment.During 2016, permissive hypercapnia was introduced with a maximal tolerated pCO2 limit of 65 mmHg (vs 55 mmHg during 2014/2015).Oxygen level was adjusted to obtain an SpO2 target range of 87\u201393% during 2016 instead of 85\u201395% during 2014/2015.During 2016, the maintenance dose of caffeine (5 mg/kg/day) was doubled in case of moderate apnea.During the second period, the first surfactant administration (200 mg/kg of Curosurf, Chiesi, Parma, Italy) was indicated when FiO2 exceeded 0.25 and 0.30 in ELGAIs and VLGAIs respectively, instead of 0.4 during the first period, whatever the gestational age (GA). During both periods, a second dose (100 mg/kg) was administered when FiO2 exceeded 0.4.

A change from a systematic sedation-analgesia toward an individualized approach based on the EDIN scale [14] was also performed in invasively ventilated infants.No major changes in the nutrition protocol occurred, except for probiotics (Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) introduced in April 2016.",

Paradoxically, our results show immediate benefits of the LR strategy, despite the absence of improved clearance of lung fluid that occurs during vaginal delivery [35]. Until recently, one of the described mechanisms of airway liquid clearance at birth was Na+ uptake across the airway epithelium. However, this cellular mechanism develops only in late gestation [36], and is too slow to clear the volume of liquid to be expelled within seconds to minutes after birth from airways. Therefore, the airway liquid clearance after birth is thought to result from an increase in the transepithelial pressure gradient, occurring during inspiration, which is incompletely effective in premature neonates [7]. Thus, our results might validate that personalized LR maneuvers helped to clear the fluid-filled airways and initiate gas exchange.",

Thus, the steady high rate of IUGR observed in our population (~ 24%) could account for a greater rate of morbidities. Given the changes that occurred in our neonatal management, confounding factors were introduced such as lowering the FiO2 threshold for surfactant administration, INSURE procedure, volume guarantee ventilation, early-rescue HFO, permissive hypercapnia, individualized doubling of the caffeine maintenance dose, and individualized sedation-analgesia. All of these factors may have protected the developing lung, and heavily influenced the pulmonary outcomes. Moreover, the multiple secondary statistical analyses made in this study limit the value of significant results. Therefore, the beneficial pulmonary outcomes must be interpreted very cautiously except probably for the intubation and surfactant administration in the DR which could not be impacted by the subsequent management changes.",
