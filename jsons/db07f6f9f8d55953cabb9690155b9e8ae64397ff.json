Normally, the dried licorice root extract may contain around 4-25% of the saponin, along with other compounds such as polyphenols, saponins, triterpenes, etc. One of the triterpenes found in the extract is the triterpenic aglycone, glycyrrhetinic acid, or \"enoxolone\" (2) . Further purification using several extraction techniques gives usually the monoammonium glycyrrhetinate salt as the purified product [2] . The World Health Organization (WHO) report on Glycyrrhizin recommends that the compound must be named \"Glycyrrhizinic acid.\" According to the report, \"Glycyrrhizin\" is the name given, more correctly, to the Licorice extract and not the saponin itself, and \"Glycyrrhizin\" and \"Glycyrrhizinic acid\" should not be used as synonyms [1] , although this is common practice in the literature. This chapter will follow this recommendation and use the second term as the saponin name.",

The intent of this chapter is to report the wide range of pharmacological activities reported in the literature for the saponin (1) and its aglycone (2) . The inclusion of the aglycone in this chapter is justified due to the fact that the saponin has no oral bioavailability, being absorbed as glycyrrhetinic acid (2) after hydrolysis of its carbohydrate moiety by intestine bacteria [5] . Since there are several reports published regarding those compounds until ca. 2010 [3, 6, 7] , the time period covered by this chapter is from 2010 onwards.",

Wang et al. reported the in vitro activity of 1 against gastric cancer cell line BCG-823. The saponin was able to prevent cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration at a 40 \u03bcM dose and they observed also that the expression of \u03b2-catenin, Bcl-2, CyclinD1, and survivin was significantly decreased [9] . In order to evaluate the carbohydrate moiety importance in the anticancer properties of 1, Yang et al. synthesized two monoglucuronides from 1 by means of a glucuronidase from Aspergillus sp. (Scheme 1). The authors reported that 18\u03b1-monoglucuronide (5) obtained was more effective against HepG2, HeLa, and A549 cancer cell lines (IC 50 values: 6.67, 7.43, and 15.76 \u03bcM, respectively) than 18\u03b2-monoglucuronide (3), 1, and 18\u03b1-glycyrrhizinic acid (4). The monoglucuronide 3 was also the best Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, with a IC 50 of 0.028 \u03bcM. Molecular docking simulations indicate that 3 also is able to bind with EGFR, suggesting that the anticancer properties of this glucuronide are related to EGFR inhibition [10] . Huang et al. in order to clarify the mechanism of the anticancer activity of 1 against lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell lines, evaluated the expression of several enzymes in an in vitro model and found that the anticancer activity of 1 against this cancer cell line can be, according to the authors, related to the inhibition of Thromboxane Synthase by 1. The same results were also found in an in vivo mouse model using a western blot assay [11] .",

Several clinical trials regarding the anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activity of 1 were also discussed. The wide range of reported activities of 1 and 2 can lead to a very important question: how safe it is the use of 1 as a sweetener? Glycyrrhizinic acid is currently considered \"Generally recognized as safe\" by the US Food and Drug Administration, and there is a guideline for maximum permitted levels of the saponin in several preparations [75] . Also, the European Commission report on Glycyrrhizin states that the saponin is safe for consumption with the warning that the maximum daily dose of 1 should not be higher than 100 mg because of the glucocorticoid effects of glycyrrhetinic acid (2), given that the saponin is absorbed by the intestine as the aglycone, after hydrolysis of its carbohydrate moiety [2] .",
