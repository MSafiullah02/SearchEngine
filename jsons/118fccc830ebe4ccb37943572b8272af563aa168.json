Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) examinations carry a heightened risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread in non-intubated patients due to possible direct droplet transmission and/or viral aerosolization and inhalation during insertion/removal of the probe and/or coughing. Although conducting a TEE in an already intubated patient may reduce the risk of viral aerosolization, viral transmission may still occur through direct contact with the patient's secretions, resulting in contaminated hands and surfaces. These infection risks apply not only to echocardiographers, but also to other patients and personnel in the vicinity, as a result of cross-contamination whenever there may have been improper handling or cleaning of the equipment.",

This focused exam approach should also be extensive enough for detecting and adequately evaluating any significant unexpected pathology. Limiting factors in performing a comprehensive TEE exam may be related to the patient's clinical condition and the nature of the surgical procedure, 6 especially in patients undergoing urgent or emergent cardiac surgery. It is important to record and store the acquired imaging data and cine loops so that they are available for review by other clinicians. Findings should be communicated and reported in a timely manner, as per routine practice.ProtectionPersonnel The levels and categories of personal protection equipment (PPE) are detailed in the main statement of the ASE on protection during COVID-19 3 . While the type of PPE may depend on institutional policies and available resources, it is generally accepted that performing TEEs in suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 warrants the use of airborne precautions, irrespective of the intubation status of the patient. All personnel should be educated in appropriate utility of PPE as per institutional policies. Whenever possible, trained observers or the use of a \"buddy system\" should ensure appropriate donning and doffing of the PPE. The most experienced echocardiographer should perform the examination, including probe insertion/removal. Although airborne precautions should be followed in all high risk patients (patients under investigation or confirmed COVID positive patients), droplet precautions are recommended for TEEs in all non-COVID patients 4, 5 .",

One approach would be to have trainees involved in interpreting and reporting 8 but not in performing these examinations. As institutional practices may vary, if trainees in advanced fellowship programs are involved in performing this examinations, they should be knowledgeable and trained in the institutional protocols to reduce infection transmission. This group does not recommend the involvement of medical students and residents in performing perioperative TEEs in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.ConclusionThe performance of transesophageal echocardiography carries a heightened risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This risk may be greater in non-intubated patients. TEE should be avoided in these patients and alternative imaging modalities considered. TEE should be performed in intubated patients only in those perioperative situations in which the benefits outweigh the risks.Careful consideration and practice of the recommendations above may help reduce the risk of transmission and cross contamination.",
