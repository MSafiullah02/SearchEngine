She asked the airline staff to witness it before boarding a plane for Hanoi. Her task was to lead a team trying to bring Vietnam out of its sudden nightmare of the deadly disease of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an illness that no one knew the cause of, nor how it spread. The person she was replacing, Dr Carlo Urbaniwho had identified the new syndromelay sickened by it in a hospital in Bangkok.",

The first was that the Vietnamese government agreed that external help should be soughtan extraordinary admission in communist Vietnam at that time. The second was the dedication of the Vietnamese staff, who quarantined themselves in the hospital and worked with little in the way of modern technology or resources. Aileen thought they should have been awarded the Medal, rather than her. Her own keen sense of family no doubt contributed to her great respect for the grief and isolation of any individual. Finally, in June, Aileen was able to return home to her recovering sister.",

Already evident to her colleagues by this time were her razor-sharp \"bullshit detector\", her interest in all matters and her keen sense of humour.Aileen went on to study at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. On returning to Australia, she obtained a Master of Public Health at the University of Sydney, eventually joining the faculty as a lecturer, while also working with the New South Wales Department of Health. Aileen co-authored a book on the impact of SARS and another on the approach to communicable diseases. 4,5 Aileen's delight was to do projects with her friends and family, and their interests were hers, be they research projects, scientific books, teaching friends' children to swim, writing creative fiction or designing tree farms.Aileen died suddenly at Jakarta Airport on 27 March 2007, while travelling home from a WHO meeting, where she had helped to bring about consensus on the issues of sharing avian influenza viruses and access to influenza vaccine for developing countries. Her spirit and values live on in her colleagues and her students. The Australian Science Communicators honoured Professor Plant as the 2007 Unsung Hero of Australian Science. The University of NSW introduced the yearly Aileen Plant Memorial Prize in Infectious Diseases Epidemiology, an honour for emerging researchers. The Public Health Association of Australia, together with three other peak public health bodies, awards the Aileen Plant Medal for Contributions to Population Health at every Population Health Congress (4-yearly), and Curtin University grants Aileen Plant Memorial Scholarships for Indigenous students and conducts an annual oration, the Aileen Plant Memorial Lecture.",
