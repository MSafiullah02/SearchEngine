Data sharing is critical to the pertinent institutions and agencies, which have to coordinate by explicitly specifying data ownership and access rights, as well as delineating the responsibilities associated with legal and privacy considerations.

Typically, public health professionals approach the surveillance or detection of a probable outbreak as an event for which all related data are dotted and analyzed in spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, the value of an IDI system is generally determined by the extent to which the system can present data and analysis results through intuitively comprehensible and cognitively efficient visualization.

In Section IV, we summarize our findings and note that our data support most of the hypotheses tested.

In this section, we summarize BioPortal's architectural design, its main components, data set availability, system functionality, and related outbreak detection research. The information that we present herein establishes the background for the evaluation study reported in the subsequent sections of this paper. Fig. 1 illustrates the architecture of the BioPortal system, including the data flows between/among the main components of BioPortal as well as between BioPortal and external data sources. From a system's perspective, BioPortal is loosely coupled with state public health information systems in California and New York. It does not change the way these state systems operate. As needed, these systems transmit WNV/botulism information through secure links to the BioPortal using mutually agreed protocols. Such information is then stored in an internal data store maintained by the BioPortal. The system also automatically retrieves data items from sources, such as those from the USGS, and stores them in this internal data store.",

Technically speaking, we adopt a data warehousing approach, rather than alternative approaches such as query translation, information linkage, or terminology mapping [9] to address the distributed data integration challenges in IDI. This choice of approach is primarily based on the following characteristics of infectious disease data sources and associated analysis needs. First, unlike many other biomedical applications for which it has become increasingly easy to query data sources automatically from remote locations, most infectious disease data sets have been developed primarily for internal use. Although accessing the underlying databases through remote queries is technologically feasible, in practice, most IDI data providers are unwilling to \"open up\" their databases. Instead, they prefer pushing preprocessed data to (or preprocessing data waiting to be pulled by) a data warehousing system such as BioPortal while retaining full control over data fields to be shared (directly at the data level as opposed to at the data access control level). Second, the types of queries performed on IDI data sources typically are confined to data aggregation requests over particular geographical regions and time periods. Therefore, there is no need to strategize complex distributed queries. However, processing speed of the data aggregation is important because such operations must be carried out in large numbers for some outbreak detection analysis approaches (see Section II-C). Third, the amount of IDI data is relatively small in terms of storage volume because epidemiological information tends to contain a few short data fields, which makes a data warehousing approach feasible. Furthermore, overlaps between epidemiological data coverage are rare; therefore, the data warehousing effort becomes relatively manageable.",

BioPortal follows a standard three-tier web architecture. The data store component, developed using SQL Server, provides a data warehouse with information pulled from or pushed by contributing data sources. The communication backbone uses standardcompliant XML formats, and is built as multiple standalone Java applications that interface with various data sources using different messaging protocols. Most system functions are developed in Java using JSP pages to interact with the user. As such, all except one major component of BioPortal can be accessed by users through a standard Web browser.

Typically, data from different organizations have different designs and are stored in different formats. To enable data interoperability, we use HL7 standards internally as the main storage format. Some data providers (e.g., New York state's HIN) have already adopted HL7 and can, thus, send HL7-compliant data to BioPortal directly. Additional steps are needed to ensure data interoperability for those data providers that do not yet have HL7-compliant data. First, we reach an agreement with them regarding the format (typically a simple home-grown XML format) for their data. Second, the data providers modify their data export module to implement this mutually agreed format. Third, when data from these providers reach BioPortal, a data normalization module maps the customized XML format on to HL7 using predetermined mapping rules implemented by the BioPortal team. In effect, the data from the HL7-compliant data providers also are processed by this module, because it removes from them unneeded data attributes, duplications, and common misspellings (based on a customized home-grown dictionary). This normalization module is not intended to resolve structural or semantic incompatibilities in an automated fashion; rather, it converts data to a predetermined format and performs shallow syntactic checking.",

When an underlying data set changes its data structure, a portal data store based on the consolidated database must be redesigned and reloaded to reflect the changes, which severely limits system scalability and extensibility. To alleviate potential computational performance problems with our XML-based design, we identify a core set of data fields based on the queries that are likely to be performed frequently. These fields are extracted from all XML messages and stored in a separate database table to enable fast retrieval.",

It builds on a set of recognized national standards such as HL7 for its data format and messaging protocols, and provides basic modeling and ontological support for data models and vocabularies. The NEDSS and HL7 standards have had major impacts on the development of IDI systems.

The connector on the portal side runs a data receiver daemon to listen for incoming messages. After a message is received, the connector checks for data integrity syntactically and normalizes the data. The connector then stores the verified message in the portal's internal data store through its data ingest control module.

The types of data that must be addressed separately with regard to access are data from humans or owned animals that require the highest levels of confidentiality, data from freeranging wildlife, and data from other systems such as vectors (e.g., mosquitoes for WNV), land use, and so forth. The need for maximum access to track diseases must be balanced against the confidentiality concerns and risks of jeopardizing data reporting to the system. We summarize BioPortal's data coverage in Table I. 4) Data Search and Alerting: BioPortal provides limited data search functions to regular IDI users. Instead of developing a generic data search interface with a full range of search criteria, after extensive discussions with potential end users (i.e., state and county epidemiologists and public health researchers), we decided to concentrate on search criteria based primarily on location and time. A specialized tabular interface allows users to quickly identify infectious disease cases that occurred at certain locations within a specified period of time. Through this interface, the user can also get summary case counts across locations and times with different levels of granularity. An advanced search module is also available to power users. Using this module, a power user can build a personalized search interface that includes additional data-set-specific search criteria.",

The user can select multiple data sets to be shown on the map in a layered manner using the checkboxes (e.g., disease cases, natural land features, land-use elements). The top-right panel corresponds to the timeline view and displays the occurrences of various cases using a Gantt chart-like display. The user can also access case details easily using the tree display located to the left of the timeline display.

How can observers determine whether unusual measures can be attributed to known random variations or are statistically significant? In the latter case, how should the explanatory factors be assessed? How can statistically significant changes be identified in a timely manner in specific geographic areas?

As a result, when the real underlying clusters do not conform to such shapes, the identified regions are often poorly localized. To overcome this major computational limitation, as part of the BioPortal technical research effort, we have developed an alternative and complementary modeling approach called riskadjusted support vector clustering (RSVC). Hotspot analysis differs from standard clustering in that clustering must be performed relative to baseline data points (representing a \"normal\" situation). In RSVC, we apply the \"risk adjustment\" concept from a crime hotspot analysis approach [12] to incorporate baseline information in the clustering process. The basic intuition behind RSVC is as follows: A robust, SVM-based clustering mechanism called support vector clustering allows detection of clusters with arbitrary shapes based on the distances defined over pairs of data points. By adjusting distance measures proportionally to the estimated density of the baseline factor, areas with high baseline density make it more difficult to group data points together as clusters, because the distances between these data points have been adjusted upward. We have also extended our RSVC approach to perform prospective hotspot analysis aimed at monitoring data sources on a continuous basis. For technical details of this BioPortal spatial-temporal data analysis work, interested readers are referred to [13] and [14] .",

(complexity = high) To assess an individual subject's accuracy in each task, we consolidated the analyses by the assisting experts to establish a \"gold-standard\" solution for that task. We measured analysis accuracy using a ten-point scale, with one being completely incorrect and ten being completely correct. We measured task completion efficiency by using the amount of time that a subject needed to complete a task. We evaluated user information satisfaction [17] using a sevenpoint Likert scale, with one indicating extreme disagreement and seven indicating extreme agreement. We adapted question items from previous research [21] to measure system usefulness and ease of use, using a seven-point Likert scale with one indicating extreme disagreement and seven indicating extreme agreement. We adopted the QUIS instrument [19] with a nine-point Likert scale to evaluate system usability. 1 Before the experiment, we used a script to inform the subjects explicitly of our objective and data analysis plan while ensuring them of the necessary information privacy. Subjects were asked to provide some demographic information, and self-assessments of their general computer self-efficacy and knowledge about computer-based spreadsheets and public health. We provided each subject with an overview of his or her assigned system and a training session based on sample tasks to illustrate how to use that system. In the experiment, each subject was asked to complete all analysis tasks grouped by analysis scenario and sequenced in increasing complexity, i.e., tasks progressing from low to high complexity. After completing all the tasks, each subject had to complete a questionnaire survey to provide his or her assessment of the system's usability, usefulness, and ease of use, as well as his or her satisfaction with the information support by the system. We imposed a 50-min time limit in the experiment, which was appropriate according to the results of a pilot study [24] .",
