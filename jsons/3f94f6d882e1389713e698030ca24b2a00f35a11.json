            "text": "Global warming imposes us to reflect on the way we carry research, embarking on the obligation to minimize the environmental impact of our research programs, with the reduction of our travel footprint being one of the easiest actions to implement, thanks to the advance of digital technology. The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), the cryogenic spectrometer of the Athena space X-ray observatory of the European Space Agency will be developed by a large international consortium, currently involving \u223c 240 members, split over 13 countries, 11 in Europe, Japan and the United States. The travel footprint associated with the development of the X-IFU is to be minimized. For that purpose, a travel footprint calculator has been developed and released to the X-IFU consortium members. The calculator uses seven different emission factors and methods leading to estimates that differ by up to a factor of \u223c 5 for the same flying distance. These differences illustrate the lack of standards and regulations for computing the footprint of flight travels and are explained primarily, though partly, by different accounting of non-CO 2 effects. When accounting for non-CO 2 effects, the flight emission is estimated as a multiple of the direct CO 2 emission from burning fuel, expressed in CO 2 -equivalent (CO 2 eq), with a multiplication factor ranging from 2 to 3. Considering or ignoring this multiplication factor is key when comparing alternative modes of transportation to flying. The calculator enables us to compute the travel footprint of a large set of travels and can help identify a meeting place that minimizes the overall travel footprint for a large set of possible city hosts, e.g. cities with large airports. The calculator also includes the option for a minimum distance above which flying is considered the most suitable transport option ; below that chosen distance, the emission of train journeys are considered. To demonstrate its full capabilities, the calculator is first run on one of the largest scientific meetings; the fall meeting of the American Geoscience Union (AGU) gathering some \u223c 24000 participants and the four meetings of the lead authors of the working group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) preparing its sixth assessment report. In both examples, the calculator is used to compute the location of the meetings that would minimize the travel footprint. Then, the travel footprint of a representative set of X-IFU related meetings is estimated to be \u223c 500 tons of CO 2 eq per year (to place this number in perspective, it is equivalent to \u223c 2 billion kilometers driven by an average passenger vehicle). Of this amount, each annual consortium meeting accounts for \u223c 100 tons, being located at a site of minimum emission and for a minimum distance for flying of 700 km. Actions to reduce the X-IFU travel footprint are being implemented, e.g., the number of large consortium meetings has been reduced to one per year and face-to-face working meetings are progressively replaced by video conferences. As the on-line travel footprint calculator may be used to all scientific collaborations and meetings, the calculator and its methodology described in this paper are made freely available to the science community 1 .",

More specifically, in order to keep global warning below 1.5 \u2022 C, CO 2 emission must be reduced globally by 45% by 2030 (from the 2010 values) with the need to reach net zero by 2050 [1] . In 2018, the total CO 2 emissions from all aviation services was 918 million metric tons. That was 2.4% of global CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel use, with a 32% increase over the last five years [2] . Aviation contributes to \u223c 10% of all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from all transportation sources [3] . The demand for flying is expected to increase following the growth and development of the world economy, the development of trade and commerce and cultural exchanges among peoples and nations, thus leading to an increase of the aircraft emission. At the current pace, aircraft emissions of carbon dioxide may reach \u223c 2400 million metric tons by 2050, with an annual traffic growth rate of 4.6% and a 2% efficiency saving, e.g. [4, 5] and references therein.",

            "text": "In addition, it is generally agreed that aviation contributes to climate change more than just with the emission of CO 2 from burning fuels, by releasing gases and particles directly into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere where they have an impact on atmospheric composition. Atmospheric changes from aircraft result from three types of processes: direct emission of radiatively active substances (e.g., CO 2 or water vapor); emission of chemical species that produce or destroy radiatively active substances (e.g., NOx, which modifies O 3 , CH 4 concentrations); and emission of substances that trigger the generation of aerosol particles or lead to changes in natural clouds (e.g., contrails) [6, 7, 8] . While the radiative forcing due to changes in CO 2 is as well characterized as those from any other sources due to human activity, estimating the forcings of non-CO 2 agents acting on shorter timescales than CO 2 is much more challenging and still subject to some uncertainties [8] , see also [4] . Because of that, in the tools commonly used to compute the emissions of flights, either non-CO 2 effects are not accounted for, or simply modeled by a multiplier of the direct CO 2 emission. The CO 2 -multiplier varies between 1.3 to 2.0, based on the estimates of the Global Warming Potential 2 of aviation emissions integrated over a 100 year timescale [8] .",

They define what they call as aspirational goal of keeping the global net CO 2 emissions from international aviation from 2020 at the same level, through technological and operational improvements, the use of sustainable aviation fuels and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) 3 . The above approach has however received a fair amount of criticisms and its overall effectiveness would need to be demonstrated, e.g. the controversial biofuels, especially those from palm oil that would result in more emissions even than the fossil fuels they replace and are a cause of biodiversity loss, deforestation and human rights abuses, or because offsetting diverts the focus from reducing emissions to trading on emissions 4 . This has been re-emphasized in the IPCC 2019 report on climate change and land (SRCCL) which flagged the limited potential to use additional land for afforestation and bioenergy production, in a context of growing concerns for increasing pressures on land, conservation of terrestrial biodiversity and food security [10] .",

Hence, the X-IFU calculator provides estimates from seven different methods, including some of the most widely used, from either national governmental agencies or Carbon offsetting companies. In interacting with members of the community, the need for a transparent calculator became obvious, and the calculator was automized and developed as an easy-to-use web application.",

The methods which do not account for non-CO 2 effects are plotted with dashed lines in Figure 1 . DEFRA provides emission factors with and without a multiplier. Here we use the DEFRA emission factors, which include a multiplication factor, referred to as a radiative forcing index, of 1.9 to account for non-CO 2 effects, noting however that DEFRA raises a warning on the uncertainty associated with the latter value [27] .

Depending on the way the plane is assumed to be filled the CO 2 emission factor per passenger.km could differ by about a factor of 1.5 (that may explain in part why the ICAO estimates are lower than the others in Figure 1 , because it makes the assumption that all aircrafts are entirely configured with economic seats). The parameters entering the emission factors are not always available for the methods used by the calculator, while one would naively expect that they are somewhat standardized and known to some accuracy. However, this is clearly not the case and the way they are considered by the data providers must explain the remaining factor of 2-2.5 difference, on top of the different assumptions they consider for accounting for non-CO 2 effects. In addition to the need to settle on the issue of the accounting for non-CO 2 effects, this clearly calls for a neutral organization to define a commonly accepted methodology for computing aircraft emissions, even more so because the overall demand for flying is predicted to increase significantly over the next decades, with little hope to make it more energy efficient.",

            "text": "The IPCC Working Group I (WGI) aims at assessing the physical scientific basis of the climate system and climate change. It is currently in its Sixth Assessment cycle, leading to the sixth Assessment Report (AR6). This assessment is done by authors from various regions of the world, and supported by bureau members and a Technical Support Unit (partly based in Paris Saclay, France, and Beijing, China, where co-chairs are located). As part of the preparation of the AR6, four Lead Author Meetings (LAM) are needed: one took place in Guangzhou (China, 215 participants), another one in Vancouver (Canada, 222 participants), another one in Toulouse (France, 248 participants) and the last one is planned in Santiago (Chile, 304 participants). In an inter-governmental organization such as the IPCC, there is a systematic search for balance between regions of the world where meetings are hosted. The location of Lead Author meetings results from proposals from governments, cities, and universities or research centers. Here we are interested to compare the travel footprint of the four meeting locations, with respect to their attendance. The participant list to each of the four LAM was provided by the Working Group I Technical Support Unit. For illustrative purposes, the travel footprint calculator was first run, considering the ICAO, DEFRA, and atmosfair estimates, i.e. from the lowest to the highest estimates, and considering a minimum distance for flying of 700 km, equivalent to accepting train journeys up to \u223c 10 hours or so. Summing the footprint of the 4 meetings, the estimates of ICAO, DEFRA, and atmosfair are \u223c 870 tons of CO 2 and \u223c 2700, 4940 tons of CO 2 eq respectively, meaning a factor of \u223c 5.5 difference in the computed emissions between the low (ICAO) and high (atmosfair) estimates. This range simply reflects the different emission functions reported in Figure 1 . The four LAM meetings ought to be located in four different continents, namely Asia, North America, Europe and South America. The calculator was run to identify the city of each continent that would be associated with the minimum emission given the audience of each meeting. For this purpose, a list of cities hosting large international airports in each continent, was given as an input to the calculator as the list of potential city hosts of the LAM. The calculator was run assuming the DEFRA emission factors and considering a minimum distance for flying of 700 km. The results are shown in Figure 3 . Because for all four LAM, there is a relatively large number of participants from Western Europe, reflecting a geographical imbalance in the authors of the AR6 WGI Report linked to an existing imbalance in ongoing world climate science research activities, the best meeting locations is expected to be on the western part of Asia and the eastern part of South and North America. This is obviously what shows Figure 3 . For example, for the meeting in Asia, Istanbul would have reduced the emission from 584 tons to 400 tons of CO 2 eq (\u223c 30% reduction). Constraining the meeting to be in China, Beijing would have reduced the emission to 530 tons of CO 2 eq (\u223c 10% reduction). Similarly, for the LAM4, having it located at Barcelona (Venezuela) would have saved \u223c 20% of the emission compared to Santiago. For the other two meetings (LAM2 and 3), the city selected was within \u223c 10% of the city of minimum emission. For indication, the total travel distance of the 4 LAM is also shown in Figure 3 . It varies from \u223c 3 (Toulouse) to \u223c 7 (Santiago) millions of km.",

Let us define the objective of a minimum distance for flying of 700 km, meaning that participants from e.g. Milan, Paris, Saclay, Grenoble, Marseille reached Toulouse by train. The X-IFU travel footprint calculator was run, assuming the mean of the ADEME, myclimate, and DEFRA estimates, and considering such a minimum distance for flying. The footprint associated with such a consortium meeting is shown in Figure 4 . The total emission of the meeting would be about \u223c 62 tons of CO 2 eq (it would be 70 tons of CO 2 eq, under the assumption that no one came by train). As can be seen, 4 attendees from Japan would then represent 25% of the travel emission, more than twice the travel emission from 12 attendees from SRON Utrecht.

Accepting 100 tons as a maximum amount of CO 2 eq emission for an extended consortium meeting would imply that the attendance of such a meeting in Japan be reduced by a factor of \u223c 10, assuming everyone flies in economy seats. The calculator offers the option to select the minimum distance for flying from 100 km to 1000 km, which then enables us to visualize easily the savings associated with train travels. We have repeated the computation above but varying the minimum distance for flying. In the worse case scenario in which nobody travels by train, the site of minimum emission would correspond to a travel footprint of 147 tons of CO 2 eq. This amount would reduce by about 42% if the minimum distance for flying is set to 1000 km. This is illustrated in Figure 7 where we show the savings, against the case where no one travels by train for the meeting described above.

Extrapolating the CNES/IRAP number per personal (0.5 ton of CO 2 eq per year) to the whole consortium, one would obtain a total footprint of 120 tons CO 2 eq per year for X-IFU representation to conferences. Again, this number should be considered uncertain, but should also be seen as a maximum value being computed prior to any optimizations of the X-IFU presence to conferences (see discussion below).",

The staffing required for the integration sequence of these instrument models is not known yet, but it appears plausible that about 100 engineers and scientists from the Consortium will have to travel to Toulouse several times for each model. Note that each sub-system may also have its own integration sequence involving additional travels. These travels are absolutely mandatory but their footprint will also be monitored. Assuming 3 models and 100 travels per model and 3 travels to Toulouse per model integration, this would amount for an CO 2 eq emission of 3 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 0.5 = 450 tons (again considering that a minimum distance for flying is 700 km). Although this number should be considered with great caution and very likely on the low side (e.g. as not accounting for trouble shooting activities, travels to support calibration. . . ), it is comparable to the one year CO 2 eq emission budget of all other X-IFU related meetings (see Table  1 ).

Integrated from 2015 until the year of the delivery of the flight model of the X-IFU, the total travel footprint associated with the development of the X-IFU is rounded to \u223c 7000 tons of CO 2 eq. It is interesting to note that this is less than the saving of 10000 tons that would have been achieved by moving the 2019 Fall meeting of the AGU from San Francisco to Detroit/Chicago. This being said, the numbers provided in table 1 are rather large, and should be seen as maximum values, against which efficient reduction measures are going to be implemented. So let us first consider the average annual travel footprint of X-IFU to be \u223c 500 tons of CO 2 eq and relate this rather abstract number to quantities that can be better apprehended. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator 9 , 500 tons of CO 2 eq correspond to \u223c 106 passenger vehicles driven for one year, 85 home electricity use for one year, could be avoided by recycling \u223c 170 tons of waste or would be sequestered by \u223c 8300 tree seedlings grown for 10 years.",

            "text": "Based on the numbers presented in table 1, the X-IFU Consortium board has already agreed to take actions to monitor and reduce the travel footprint of the X-IFU. The first decision taken was to reduce the number of Consortium meetings to one per year instead of two. The numbers presented in table 1 are the one to work against, and to which reduction measures will be proposed for implementation within the X-IFU Consortium on the shortest possible term. Those measures have already been discussed in the context of reducing the environmental impact of scientific activities [11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] , such as conferences, but they now have to be put in place along the development of a large infrastructure, such as the X-IFU. The actions foreseen for X-IFU are listed below: -Favor video conferences whenever possible, even for meetings in which critical matters are discussed and face-to-face discussions may be preferred. As an example, analyzing the total cost of videoconferencing, including operating costs of the network and videoconferencing equipment, lifecycle assessment of equipment costs, although the footprint of virtual meetings depend on many factors such as distance travelled, meeting duration, and the technologies used, [33] found that videoconferencing takes at most 7% of the energy/carbon of an in-person meeting. A videoconferencing system (e.g. Zoom) has been set-up for both the CNES and IRAP teams, and provides satisfaction, even for meetings attended by more than 40 people. It is thus likely that some topical meetings will be held by videoconference. This may have the further benefit of increasing attendance and increasing efficiency due to the time saved by not traveling. -Optimize the travels of all participants to the one week long Consortium meetings by organizing topical meetings, next to the plenary sessions, as to cover a full week. On a project like X-IFU, we do need physical interactions within and outside work. This also means that special attention should be brought to the social events linked to consortium meetings. -Avoid short duration single goal meetings, and make the best use of each travel, extending the stay to participate to nearby events (schools, seminars,. . . ), to network, especially for the youngest members of the Consortium. -Keep the CO 2 eq emission of all consortium meetings around 100 tons, and restrict the attendance accordingly, but sweep the locations across the whole consortium, i.e., not always meeting in western Europe. This is required not to impose the most distant members of the X-IFU consortium to fly every time, hence being always exposed to jet lags, fatigue, losing time on travels. . . . This is also required to ensure that each contributing country receives proper visibility. -Investigate the possibility to hold multi-node distributed consortium meetings: in Europe, Japan, and United States for instance. This scheme is now broadly discussed for large scientific events. Assuming a minimum distance for flying of 700 km (and the mean of the ADEME, myclimate, and DEFRA estimates), and assuming one hub in Europe, one in Japan and one in the United States, if each hub is located at the site associated with the minimum emission, the 100 tons could be reduced to \u223c 36 tons of CO 2 eq by meeting in Geneva, Sagamihara, and Greenbelt, meaning a reduction by a factor of 3. This shall be considered as a maximum saving, as each hub meeting may receive attendees originally associated with another hub (e.g. youngest members of the Consortium, Consortium board members. . . ). -Locate always X-IFU related meetings at the site of minimum emission for the given audience, reachable by train within less than a day, close to international hubs which can be reached directly (to avoid connecting flights), with the list of attendees restricted to key persons, whose presence is mandatory. Changes in meeting organization may be needed to enable people to reach the meeting place by train, without impacting their private life, i.e. not having to travel over the weekends. -Coordinate the presence of X-IFU to international conferences, restricting the number of attendees to the bare minimum, sending representatives of the project residing close to the conference sites, and privilege those conferences where there is a clear policy towards minimizing the travel footprint and/or which promote alternative ways of attendance (e.g., virtual participation). Give priority to the youngest consortium members to attend conferences, e.g., for presenting and promoting their work and contribution to the project but also for networking. . . . Within X-IFU, one should accompany and support the transition to evaluating differently the evolution of academic careers, as to ensure that those who fly less are not penalized. -Compensate: X-IFU is funded by public money. At the level of the funding agencies, there is no global compensation mechanism yet implemented. Compensation occurs only at personal level. Shall compensation be made possible in the future, its efficiency should however be demonstrated.",

We have computed road distances from Toulouse and Paris to a set of cities across Europe, within \u223c 1300 km. We plot road distances versus great circle distances in Figure 9 . As can be seen, under the above assumption, with some scattering, road distances are found on average 35% larger than great circle distances. Since the calculator computes the great circle distances between city pairs, to compute the emission of the train journey, a 1.35 multiplication factor is applied to the emission associated with the measured great circle distance.",

The methodology applied in calculating the Eurostar emission factors accounts for the total electricity use by Eurostar trains on the UK and France/Belgium track sections, the total passenger numbers (and therefore calculated passenger km) on all Eurostar services, the emission factors for electricity (in kgCO 2 per kWh) for the UK and France/Belgium journey sections. On the other hand, the national rail factor refers to an average emission per passenger km for diesel and electric trains in 2017-18 (\u223c 40 g of CO 2 per passenger.km). For both international and national rail factors, the CH 4 and N 2 O emission factors have been estimated from the corresponding emission factors for electricity generation, proportional to the CO 2 emission factors. The sum of CO 2 CH 4 and N 2 O emissions is expressed in CO 2 eq (see [27] for more details).",
