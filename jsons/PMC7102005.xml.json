            "text": "Invasive bacterial infections are common complications following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. During the early post-transplant period, HSCT recipients have two critical risk factors for invasive infections: prolonged neutropenia and breaks in the mucocutaneous barrier, resulting from the HSCT preparative regimen and from frequent vascular access required for patient care. The use of long-term central venous catheters (CVC) has become an essential part of the management of bone marrow transplant recipients and its importance in the pathogenesis of bacterial, as well as invasive fungal blood stream infections is well established [1\u20133]. A recent German multicenter study of a total of 1899 patients who had undergone bone marrow transplant or peripheral blood stem cell transplant demonstrated incidences of bloodstream infections (BSIs) of 22.4 BSIs per 100 patients following allogeneic transplantation and 18.2 BSIs per 100 patients following autologous transplantation. The majority (57%) of pathogens associated with BSI were coagulase-negative staphylococci [4].",

Specifically, they are more common in allogeneic transplants (5.6%) as compared with autologous transplants (1%). Recently, Labarca et al. reported an outbreak of S. maltophilia bacteremia in eight allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients in a bone marrow transplant center in the USA. Compared with concurrently hospitalized allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients, these patients were more likely to have severe and prolonged neutropenia as well as severe mucositis [9]. In our study, the higher incidence of bacteremia in the allogeneic HSCT group may also be due to higher incidence of prolonged neutropenia and non-engraftment in these patients. In addition, patients after allogeneic transplants are immunocompromised more deeply and for longer periods of time, cutaneous and gastrointestinal GVHD in allogeneic transplantations could facilitate bacterial seeding into the blood, and possibly most importantly, CVCs were kept during longer periods following allogeneic transplants as compared with autologous transplants (median, 4.5 vs. 2 months, respectively) and were more frequently manipulated (e.g. for blood sampling and transfusions). Both long duration of catheterization and number of manipulations have been linked to increased risk of CVS infection [10, 11].",

S. maltophilia is intrinsically resistant to carbapenems and exposure to these antibiotic agents may perpetuate the infection [13].",

It demonstrated that octenidine in alcoholic solution may be a better option than alcohol alone for the prevention of CVC-associated infections, due to significantly fewer positive cultures of the catheter tip and a non-significant reduction in catheter-associated bloodstream infections in the octenidine group [14].",
