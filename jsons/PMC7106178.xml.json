            "text": "Since the majority of emerging infectious diseases in humans have their origin in animals (Wolfe et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2008), improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying interspecies transmissions is of major importance. Bats are of particular interest in this respect for a number of reasons: Firstly, they represent almost 20% of all recognised mammalian species, forming the second largest mammalian order after rodents, with more than 1300 different bat species distributed almost worldwide (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015). Secondly, bats harbour a large variety of viruses. Mostly in tropical regions, bats have been identified as reservoir hosts of some highly pathogenic and zoonotic viruses such as rabies virus, Ebola and Marburg viruses, Hendra and Nipah viruses, and coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like coronaviruses (Burns et al., 1958, O'Shea et al., 2014, Smith and Wang, 2013, Calisher et al., 2006). For European bat species, several studies revealed a broad variety of viruses by examining samples of various species, mostly using molecular detection methods, e.g. astroviruses, coronaviruses, herpes viruses, picornaviruses and paramyxoviruses in insectivorous bats from Germany, Hungary and Italy (Wibbelt et al., 2007, Drexler et al., 2011, Kurth et al., 2012, Kemenesi et al., 2014, Kemenesi et al., 2015, Lelli et al., 2012). Except for lyssaviruses and potentially orthoreoviruses, however, there is no proof to date of any pathogenicity of European bat viruses to humans (Kohl et al., 2012, Lelli et al., 2013, Steyer et al., 2013). Thirdly, bats are very gregarious and the vast majority of all species form colonies, which can reach enormous numbers and densities of individuals during certain periods of the year (Kerth, 2008). This could facilitate the spread of viruses within bat populations. Fourthly, due to their ability to fly, several bat species are potentially capable of spreading viruses over large distances (species specific dispersal distances range from dozens to hundreds of kilometres, Dietz et al., 2007). Finally, bats often share roosts, such as tree cavities, with other animals and/or settle close to humans, e.g. in roofs of houses. As a consequence bats may spread viruses to other animals and to humans (Steyer et al., 2013, Kemenesi et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Despite the large number of molecular virus records in temperate zone bats, hardly anything is known about the course of infection in the individual hosts and the factors that influence intra- and inter-species transmission of viruses. The particular life history and physiology of bats may reduce the pathogenic effects of virus infections, but at the same time increase the virus diversity in bats. For example, the elevated body temperature due to flight activity may mimic the fever reaction of other mammals. This increased body temperature activates the immune response (O'Shea et al., 2014). In contrast, the reduced body temperature during torpor bouts in summer and prolonged torpor during hibernation will reduce the immune response and therefore hamper the virus clearance. At the same time torpor has been suggested to facilitate the development of a persistent virus infection (Sulkin and Allen, 1974, George et al., 2011). It has even been postulated that with these mechanisms bats may have developed the preference of incomplete viral clearance in order to evade immunopathologically induced morbidity and mortality (O'Shea et al., 2014). Given these facts, we predicted to observe an intermittent virus detectability rather than a long-term presence of the same virus strain in individual bats sampled at different time points.",

In our study, we analysed the detection rates of nucleic acids related to astro-, corona- and paramyxoviruses in bat colonies in the German regions of Bavaria (BY), Mecklenburg Western Pomerania (MV) and North Rhine Westphalia (NRW). We focused on Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii), Natterer's bat (M. nattereri), Daubenton's bats (M. daubentonii) and brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), which have a similar roosting ecology (Dietz et al., 2007) and where long-term data on the social structure and the individual movements among roosts are available (e.g. Kerth and Van Schaik, 2012, Fleischmann and Kerth, 2014). Some of the colonies studied in BY have been monitored for more than twenty years. In these colonies, subcutaneously implanted microchips, so called PIT-tags, allowed precise monitoring and documentation of social structures in the past (Kerth et al., 2011) and for this present study.",

While bats were captured from bat boxes in forests in BY and MV, animals in NRW were captured in their nursery roosts in cow barns and during swarming at hibernacula in autumn. The urine and faeces samples were collected directly from the individual bats during regular capture events while being handled, in order to minimise the possibility of cross-contamination. Urine samples were collected as a swab sample. The permissions to capture and sample the bats were issued by the respective local conservation authorities. Adult bats in the sampled colonies in BY were individually marked with implanted passive integrated transponders (PIT-tags; Kerth et al., 2011). The last four digits of their PIT tags were used to identify individuals. In these colonies, samples were collected from the majority of individuals twice per year over four consecutive years (from 2011 until 2014), once before parturition and once after parturition.

Samples were investigated for the presence of astrovirus (AstV) related RNA by hemi-nested RT-PCR targeting the highly conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (Chu et al., 2008). A synthetic RNA based on a bat AstV sequence detected in China (Bat astrovirus 1 isolate AFCD337 polyprotein GenBank: EU847155) was used as the positive control. To confirm our results, we have performed exemplary repeats (up to four times) of PCR and sequence analysis, and the results were 100% consistent in all cases. Samples were also analysed for the presence of paramyxovirus (PmV) and coronavirus (CoV) RNA as described before (Tong et al., 2008, de Souza Luna et al., 2007).

In detail, the first round of RT-PCR was carried out using the Super Script III One Step RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and a mixture of two forward and one reverse primers (Supplementary Table 1) with a final concentration of 2 \u03bcM each. The total reaction volume of 50 \u03bcl contained 5 \u03bcl of purified RNA per investigated sample. Amplification involved 30 min at 50 \u00b0C for reverse transcription of RNA and 2 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 30 cycles of 15 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at 50 \u00b0C for annealing and 40 s at 72 \u00b0C for extension, completed by a last step of 7 min at 72 \u00b0C for final extension. Hemi-nested PCR was conducted with two forward primers and the first-round PCR reverse primer at a final concentration of 2 \u03bcM each. Reactions were composed using the PWO DNA Polymerase Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim) and a 10 mM dNTP Mix (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim). The final volume of 50 \u03bcl contained 2 \u03bcl of the first-round product.

            "text": "Sequences were assembled and proofread in Geneious 8.1.3 (Biomatters Limited, Auckland, New Zealand). We only included sequences in the phylogenetic analyses of which the quality was satisfactory, i.e. where the electropherogram signals were readable and where forward and reverse sequencing resulted in the same sequence, and if the contig sequence generated from the forward and reverse sequencing results comprised more than 250 nt. Fragment lengths from 279 to 389 nt were included in the phylogenetic analysis of AstV sequences, while the fragments used for the phylogenetic analysis of CoV comprised 381\u2013419 nt, and of 382\u2013459 nt for the PmV analysis. According to BLAST analyses against the GenBank database, sequences were allocated to the host species of the most similar hit. For phylogenetic analyses, our sequences and selected reference sequences from GenBank were aligned using MAFFT 7.017 (Katoh and Standley, 2013). As the AstV and PmV sequences exhibited indels, these alignments had to be corrected manually in a few positions. Base frequencies of the AstV and PmV sequences were inhomogeneous as indicated by a \u03a72-test implemented in PAUP* 4b10 (Swofford, 2003) [\u03c72\n = 193.123, df = 159, p = 0.034; \u03c72\n = 100.055, df = 63, p = 0.002; after exclusion of constant sites as proxies for invariant sites (Lockhart et al., 1994): \u03c72\n = 240.429, df = 159, p < 0.001; \u03c72\n = 124.562, df = 63, p < 0.001]. Therefore, the phylogeny of the AstV and PmV sequences were not only reconstructed using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BA) methods as the CoV sequences, but also by neighbour-joining trees based on LogDet distances, which are insensitive to the effects potentially caused by inhomogeneous base frequencies (Lockhart et al., 1994). The neighbour-joining analyses were conducted in PAUP* 4b10 and invariant sites were removed in proportion to the frequencies estimated from constant sites (Waddel and Steel, 1997). For ML and BA, jModeltest 2.1.4 (Darriba et al., 2012) was used to find the best fitting substitution models. These were TVM + I + \u0393 for the AstV sequences and TIM3 + \u0393 for the CoV and PmV sequences according to the Bayesian information criterion. ML and BA were conducted in GARLI 2.1 (Zwickl, 2006) and MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003). As MrBayes implements only a restricted number of models, the next similar to those identified by jModeltest, viz. GTR + I + \u0393 and GTR + \u0393, were applied for AstV sequences and CoV as well as Paramyxo sequences, respectively. MrBayes was run for 2 Mio generations sampling every 100th with a burn-in of 10%, and otherwise default settings. Convergence of parameter estimates was monitored using the criteria implemented in MrBayes as well as in Tracer 1.6 available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/. The best ML tree was selected among 500 replicates. The analysis comprised 500 replicates in the case of ML bootstrap analyses, and 1000 replicates for the neighbour-joining trees. The PmV trees contained one long-branching sequence. Excluding it from the analyses did not change the topologies so that long-branch attraction (Felsenstein, 1978) can be ruled out.",

The highest detection rates were determined for six out of 74 analysed individual samples from M. nattereri in NRW (8.1%) and two out of 22 analysed samples from P. nathusii in MV (9%), while the average detection rate for CoV was only 1.4%. Sequence analysis revealed a close similarity to alphacoronavirus sequences described from P. nathusii in Northern Germany (Gloza-Rausch et al., 2008) and greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) in Rhineland-Palatinate (RP) (Drexler et al., 2011) (Supplementary Fig. 1; Genbank accession numbers KT894920 - KT894926). Six of our CoV sequences were included in further phylogenetic analyses. These analyses indicated a species-specificity of CoV strains, i.e. sequences detected in samples from P. nathusii from MV and RP (Drexler et al., 2011), two sites, which are approx. 600 km apart from each other, showed a sequence similarity of 97.3%, while CoV strains from P. pygmaeus from MV and a sampling location approx. 100 km apart (Gloza-Rausch et al., 2008) displayed a similarity of 98.5%. Moreover, sequences amplified from M. nattereri from our different sampling locations showed a similarity of 98.9% with a sequence from M. nattereri sampled in Hungary (Kemenesi et al., 2014). The only CoV sequence we obtained from a M. bechsteinii sample also falls into this cluster of M. nattereri bat-associated sequences.

For M. nattereri, representing the only bat species that could be analysed in all three sampling areas, the AstV detection rate was lowest in BY (50 positives out of 152 samples, i.e. 32.9%) and highest in NRW (39 positives out of 74 samples, i.e. 52.7%). The detection ranges determined for BY, where sampling was performed in four consecutive years, varied between the years, resulting in a comparably broad range of determined detection rates (Supplementary Tab 4). We detected 47 different AstV sequences altogether, from 200 positive out of the 775 analysed bats. 16 different sequences alone were identified from 30 positive M. daubentonii samples (out of 47 analysed individuals of this species). On the other hand, M. bechsteinii, representing the species where the largest quantity of bats were sampled (321) only yielded 35 positive samples carrying 8 different sequences.",

However, in some rare instances (5 animals out of 28 recaptured positive bats, representing 18%), animals were identified as positive again after recapture. One M. bechsteinii (PIT-tag: C073) turned out to carry the same AstV sequence (B1, Table 1\n) in May 2011 as well as three months later in August. Another M. bechsteinii (1A0D) also carried the sequence B1 in May 2011, and carried a sequence assigned as avian AstV by GenBank (sequence B8) in August 2013. AstV sequences amplified from a M. nattereri (2ACE) at both sampling events (sequences N8 and N4) just showed an 80% similarity, suggesting a re-infection with a different strain.

The phylogenetic analysis of the 47 sequences detected in four bat species revealed a good correlation between the sampled bat species and the AstV strain, almost completely irrespective of the sampling region in Germany and Hungary.

It must however also be kept in mind that the applied RT-PCR assay was selected for its ability to detect a wide range of different virus strains, at the cost of a high detection sensitivity, therefore some false negative results cannot be completely ruled out. In order to increase the sensitivity of our assays, we considered establishing specific real-time PCR assays, but due to the variability of the sequence types, at least eight different real-time PCR assays would need to be established to be able to detect all sequence types known so far.

These AstV sequences were predominantly found in M. bechsteinii, where we only detected one AstV sequence type that was directly allocated by GenBank as a bat AstV. In this species, we detected five AstV sequences that were assigned as avian AstV, which were closely related to a similar sequence from a M. Nattereri, suggesting the presence of a novel AstV group. Similar findings on species assignment of AstV sequences have been reported by others in AstV screening studies. For example, AstV surveys of bats (Zhu et al., 2009) and birds (Chu et al., 2012) in China also revealed a close relation of AstV sequences assigned as human and feline sequences with bat associated sequences. Furthermore, screening of a variety of small mammalian species in China revealed a surprisingly close phylogenetic relationship between some rodent AstV and ungulate AstV (Hu et al., 2014), that cannot be explained yet. It therefore cannot be completely ruled out that the AstV nomenclature is in some cases misleading, since the newly identified virus sequences are often simply nominated according to the species of first detection of virus related nucleic acid (Monroe et al., 2005, De Benedictis et al., 2011). In most cases, this is done without a successful virus isolation from this species as a proof of a productive infection herein, leaving the possibility of a passive virus transmission, or even an external contamination. From these findings we conclude that further studies regarding the occurrence of AstV in different mammalian species, especially bats, is required. Such studies need to include virus isolation attempts, in order to be able to assess the real species spectrum of AstV strains that have been assigned to a species based on phylogenetic analysis. Results of such studies would also shed more light on a possible zoonotic potential of some AstV strains.",

It is possible that different species meet at joint hibernacula, which thus provide opportunities for virus transmission. However, this should not affect our conclusions, because if bats of different species meet during winter and if viruses were not species specific we should find the same or at least very similar virus sequences in different bat species within a region where joint hibernation is possible. This was clearly not the case, supporting our conclusion of a strong species specificity of the detected virus sequences.",

The finding is interesting, as our four main study species are not migrating very far (typically less than 50 km; Dietz et al., 2007). As a consequence our study populations are very unlikely to exchange individuals between the sampled regions MV, BY, and NRW. Overall, our findings are valuable for the general understanding of virus distribution in habitats with mixed species, and also to improve our understanding of the spectrum of host species of AstV and CoV strains.",
