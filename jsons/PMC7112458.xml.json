We build scale-free networks (SFNs)\nbased on the configuration model.10 The\nso-called structural cutoff40\nkmax\u223cN1/2\nis considered to constrain the maximum possible degree kmax on\nSFNs. Fig. 3 shows the final outbreak size and the\neffective epidemic threshold as a function of \u03bc for SFNs with \u03b3=2.5 and \u03b3=4.0. Like the case on RRNs,\nthe final outbreak size increases with recovery rate when the value of \u03bb\nis given [see Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)], and the effective epidemic threshold decreases with\n\u03bc [see Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)]. Due to the weak degree heterogeneity of SFNs with \u03b3=4.0, the effective epidemic\nthreshold decreases more rapidly with \u03bc in such networks than that for\nSFNs with \u03b3=2.5. The theoretical\npredictions are very close to the simulated results for SFNs with \u03b3=4.0, while there are some\ndifference between them for SFNs with \u03b3=2.5. This can be explained\nby the fact that for scale-free networks with small degree exponent \u03b3 and\nlarge network size N, the strong degree heterogeneity leads to the result\nthat the high degree vertices connect preferentially to low degree ones, and as a\nconsequence, such networks show disassortative mixing.41 The actual disassortative mixing pattern contradicts with the\ntheoretical assumption that the network is uncorrelated, which results in the difference\nbetween the simulated result and the theoretical prediction. While for the networks with\nlarge degree exponent \u03b3=4.0, the degree\ndistributions are relatively homogeneous, thereby the edge-based compartmental theory\ncould provide the relatively accurate predictions.",

Two basic updating methods\nare considered: asynchronous updating and synchronous updating. For the case of asynchronous\nupdating, the recovery rate only alters the time scale of SIR spreading dynamics but does\nnot affect the phase transition and final state.

We numerically identified the effective epidemic\nthreshold \u03bbc with the variability measure, which has been\nconfirmed to be effective for identifying the SIR effective epidemic threshold, and found\nthat \u03bbc indeed decreases with \u03bc for the case of\nsynchronous updating. As the infection and recovery events may happen consecutively in the\nsynchronous updating process, the mean infection ability of a single infected node is\nenlarged by large recovery rate. The results showed good agreements between the theoretical\npredictions and the simulated results on RRNs. To explore the university of these\nconclusions, we further carry on these studies on scale-free and real-world networks, where\nthe similar phenomena were observed.
