Many countries have instituted measures to stop the spread of the virus throughout the world. Currently, many hospitals in China have only limited amounts of medical supplies. As one of the first areas in which patients are seen, the radiology department should not delay the use of hierarchical management of the department. Our department is a noncentralized isolation hospital outside of the Hubei region. The patients are diverse, and the medical staff is at risk of infection. Although there may be some deficiencies in the regionalized management of our institution, preliminary prevention and control work can still be promptly instituted. In the face of acute infectious diseases, including SARS, MERS, Zika virus infection, and Ebola virus infection (7), it is very important to maintain strict isolation procedures in the radiology department. This not only protects the medical staff but also improves their clinical work (8).",
