            "text": "Background: Human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Translational challenges include restoring hMSC efficacy following cryopreservation, developing effective xenogeneic-free (XF) hMSCs and establishing true therapeutic potential at a clinically relevant time point of administration. We wished to determine whether cytokine pre-activation of cryopreserved, bone marrow-derived XF-hMSCs would enhance their capacity to facilitate injury resolution following VILI and elucidate mechanisms of action. Methods: Initially, in vitro studies examined the potential for the secretome from cytokine pre-activated XF-hMSCs to attenuate pulmonary epithelial injury induced by cyclic mechanical stretch. Later, anaesthetised rats underwent VILI and, 6 h following injury, were randomized to receive 1 \u00d7 10 7 XF-hMSC/kg that were (i) naive fresh, (ii) naive cryopreserved, (iii) cytokine pre-activated fresh or (iv) cytokine pre-activated cryopreserved, while control animals received (v) vehicle. The extent of injury resolution was measured at 24 h after injury. Finally, the role of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in mediating the effect of pre-activated XF-hMSCs was determined in a pulmonary epithelial wound repair model. Results: Pre-activation enhanced the capacity of the XF-hMSC secretome to decrease stretch-induced pulmonary epithelial inflammation and injury. Both preactivated fresh and cryopreserved XF-hMSCs enhanced resolution of injury following VILI, restoring oxygenation, improving lung compliance, reducing lung leak and improving resolution of lung structural injury. Finally, the secretome of pre-activated XF-hMSCs enhanced epithelial wound repair, in part via a KGF-dependent mechanism.",

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) demonstrate beneficial effects in diverse pre-clinical lung injury models including pulmonary [4] [5] [6] and abdominal sepsis [7] [8] [9] , bleomycin-induced acute lung injury [10] and fibrosis [11, 12] . Human-derived MSCs (hMSCs) enhance injury resolution following established VILI [13, 14] , enhance recovery of human lungs ex vivo [15] and reduce the severity of Escherichia coli pneumonia [16] . Finally, recent phase 1-2 studies suggest that allogeneic bone marrow-derived hMSCs (BM-hMSCs) can be safely administered to patients with moderate to severe ARDS [17, 18] .",

Xenogeneic culture-free (XF) supplements such as the recently patented XF supplement (WO2015121471 A1) have been developed that preserve the differentiation, proliferation and low immunogenicity properties of MSCs [26] .

IL-8 secretion from naive or pre-activated hMSCs, before and after freezing (24 and 48 h post-cryopreservation), was determined using an IL-8 sandwich ELISA DuoSet kit (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) to confirm the responsive state persisted post-thaw (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). For in vivo experiments, cryopreserved XF-hMSCs were stored for up to 2 months and cell viability after thaw was between 95 and 97% as determined by trypan blue exclusion.",

Third, we demonstrate the potential for Fig. 2 Pre-activated, cryopreserved, XF-hMSCs restore lung function after VILI. All MSC treatments significantly restored arterial PO 2 , with pre-activated cryopreserved cells statistically better than their naive alternatives (a). For static lung compliance, only activated fresh and activated frozen delivery showed significant restoration and were statistically different to their naive counterparts (b). All treatment groups restored the lung wet to dry ratio (c), but only pre-activated MSCs modulated BAL protein content (d). *, ** and ***P < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively, versus PBS control groups; $ P < 0.05 versus corresponding naive groups.

The alternative, namely provision of freshly cultured hMSC, would require that hMSCs are continuously available for harvest, in facilities adjacent to the clinical settings, which presents substantial logistical and economic challenges. Other challenges include the risk of increased cell batch variability and the potential for contamination of batches. However, several studies demonstrate that the cryopreservation and thawing processes may significantly reduce the efficacy of hMSCs [19, 40] . Our finding that cryopreserved XF-hMSCs can enhance the resolution of VILI when administered at therapeutically relevant time points in our rodent model supports recent findings in other models, including pneumonia-induced ARDS [41] , and are important demonstrations of the feasibility of cryopreservation of hMSCs. This insight is further supported by the observation that the secretory profile of hMSCs in regard to IL-8 release, whether the hMSCs were pre-activated or not, remained the same pre-and post-cryopreservation.",

These findings were also true for the enhancement of wound healing. We further went on to show that KGF neutralization can negate the enhancement observed as a result of cytokine preactivation. These outcomes extend findings from previous in vitro and in vivo studies showing that the MSC secretome resolved the inflammatory response and promoted repair and recovery post-VILI [13, 33] and thus strengthens the justification for the use of the secretome as a viable alternative therapy against VILI. However, it should be noted that the secretome may be less effective compared to hMSCs, especially in the early phases of the injury resolution process [46] .",

            "text": "There are a number of limitations to these studies. First, while we provide data to demonstrate that pre-activation of cryopreserved XF hMSCs enhances their ability to promote injury resolution following VILI and the ability of their secretome to reduce stretch injury and promote pulmonary epithelial wound repair, these studies were carried out in a rodent model and in vitro, and caution must be exercised in extrapolating to the clinical situation. However, we have used a clinically relevant injury resolution VILI model and utilized human MSCs. Thus, these findings strongly suggest that the therapeutic potential of cryopreserved XF-hMSCs for human ARDS may be enhanced by pre-activation measures. Second, we did not use a control non-stem cell group, such as a fibroblast group. In our previous experiments, rodent fibroblasts had no beneficial effect [35] , while in experiments using human fibroblasts in rodents, some parameters indicative of injury were worsened [51] . Therefore, we believe that a fibroblast control is not justifiable for these studies. Our in vitro studies used A549 cells, an adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal cell line. These cells did have the advantage of being a widely used cell line, and they had an integrated NF-\u03baB reporter. Finally, we do not provide data on a single overall mechanism of action of MSCs. Our studies to date [33, 35, 51, 52] , and those of other groups [15, 53, 54] , indicate that the effects of MSCs on, for example, innate and adaptive immunity, including antimicrobial effects, are varied, context dependent and not encapsulated by a single secreted mediator or group of mediators. Nonetheless, we show that the mechanisms of MSC therapy via their secretome as a whole is enhanced with pre-activation and is partly mediated through KGF.",

These xenogeneic hMSCs were similarly effective following cryopreservation and thawing to fresh MSCs. Cytokine pre-activation further enhanced the efficacy of cryopreserved xeno-free MSCs. KGF may mediate some of the protective effects of these cryopreserved xeno-free MSCs. Taken together, these findings address important translational concerns and significantly advances cryopreserved xeno-free hMSCs towards clinical testing for patients with ARDS.",
