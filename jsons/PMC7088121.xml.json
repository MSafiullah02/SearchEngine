            "text": "\nInhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. A biological target with regard to the treatment of obesity is the inhibition of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC). ACC is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, a step that is vital in fatty acid synthesis. Two isoforms of ACC, ACC1 and ACC2, have been identified in mammals. Acetyl-CoA is metabolized via the citric acid cycle if it is not converted into malonyl-CoA. ACC1 and ACC2 are highly expressed in the liver where fatty acid synthesis and oxidation are important. ACC2, the isoform predominantly present in heart and skeletal tissues, regulates the amount of fatty acid used in \u03b2-oxidation by inhibiting carnitine palmitoyl transferase. Inhibition of both isoforms would decrease the synthesis of new fatty acids and deplete the use of fatty acids stored, thereby resulting in weight loss.4 Additionally, ACC inhibitors may be used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.5 ACC inhibition is expected to impact both skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity by rebalancing lipid metabolism associated with insulin resistance pathogenesis. Menhaji-Klotz and coworkers at Pfizer Inc. synthesized many 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecan-2-ones containing a pyrazole ring fused to positions 3 and 4 in two different ways to achieve this ACC inhibition.5 IC50 values for ACC inhibition of 67 and 174 nM were measured for compounds 1a and 2, respectively (Fig. 4). Part of the same group synthesized a library of 125 3,4-pyrazole-fused 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecan-2-ones (compounds 1b\u2013o as representative examples) and tested them for IC50 values on human recombinant ACC1 and ACC2. The smallest IC50 for ACC1 and ACC2 found were 3.4 and 1.0 nM, respectively, both exhibited by compound 1b (Fig. 4).4\n\n",

In this study, additional pharmacokinetics were studied along with the IC50 values for ACC1 and ACC2, such as the lipophilic ligand efficiency (LipE), measured lipophilicity (ElogD), human liver microsomal incubation (HLM), and passive permeability (Papp) in Ralph Russ canine kidney cells.6 1,9-Diazaspiro[5.5]undecan-2-one 1c (Fig. 4) was selected for a SAR study of the effects of modifying the 3,4-pyrazole-fused moiety. Herein it was found that decreasing the bulk of the substituent at N-2 atom of the pyrazole ring (with respect to t-Bu group) similarly decreased ACC1/ACC2 inhibition. Increasing the bulkiness of this group (tert-pentyl) improved the IC50 values for both ACC1 and ACC2, but also resulted in an increase in HLM by a factor of 4, which outweighed the small inhibitory advantage. Introducing substitution at the N-1 atom did improve the Papp values, but resulted in too much loss of ACC inhibition. Therefore, the tert-butyl-substituted pyrazole-fused core was used for the further studies.",

Comparisons were made with compound 1c. Compounds 1d,e showed similar ACC inhibition, HLM clearance, and LipE, but only modest improvement of Papp. Compounds 1f,g showed improved Papp, and good ACC inhibition, but LipE values lowered along with higher HLM clearance. The very good ACC1 and ACC2 IC50 values of compound 1g (7 and 3 nM, respectively) were matched by compound 1h (11 and 5 nM, respectively). Compound 1h was designed on results obtained from compounds 1f,g in the hope of showing a better LipE value, which it did. The downside was the poor Papp value obtained for compound 1h when compared to compound 1g. Compound 1i showed reasonable LipE values and diminished ACC inhibition (74 and 29 nM for ACC1 and ACC2, respectively), but a greatly increased Papp value of 9.7 (\u00d710\u20136 cm/s) vs 0.8 for compound 1h. Based on these results, a further SAR study was performed by using isoquinolines and quinolines as substituents (compounds 1j\u2013o). The development of aminosubstituted species 1l\u2013o did result in improved thermodynamic solubility at pH 1.2 with a factor up to 10 when compared to compounds 1j,k. The Papp values of compounds 1l,m were as bad as those of compound 1h. Efforts to improve Papp by increasing the alkylation on the amine led to compounds 1n,o exhibiting better Papp than compounds 1l,m. The Papp values of compounds 1n,o were still lower than those obtained for compounds 1j,k and, in addition, HLM clearance significantly worsened. Compounds 1j,k were chosen for in vivo examination of their pharmacological properties. Compound 1j showed the best pharmacokinetics with an oral bioavailability of 71%, c\nmax 403 ng/ml, AUC 2070 ng\u00b7h/l when administered to rats at 5 mg/kg. An intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg in rats demonstrated a moderate systemic clearance of 29 ml/(min\u00b7kg) and volume of distribution of 1.7 l/kg. Similarly, compound 1k showed lower bioavailability and better clearance and volume of distribution than compound 1j. Different oral dosages of compound 1j were administered to rats in combination with 14C-labeled acetate precursors of lipids. The conversion of these acetate precursors into their respective lipid products for different dosages is shown in Figure 5.6 It became clear from these results that compound 1j could be very effective in decreasing new fatty acid synthesis and, therefore, in treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n",

NPY is most abundant in the brain and has a high expression in the hypothalamus.12 Furthermore, NPY is expressed in the spinal cord and most sympathetic nerve fibers, especially around blood vessels. Antagonism of the NPY receptors (NPY Y1\u2013Y5) has been related to reduced food-intake in mammals,11 making NDY antagonists that especially the NPY Y1 and NPY Y5 are important targets for treating obesity.13 The treatment of obesity by NPY Y5 antagonism works in two ways. Firstly, it was found that food consumption was lowered by 10% in diet-induced obese mice. Secondly, the chronic treatment with NPY Y5 antagonists inhibited the reduction of the metabolic rate. This indicated that NPY Y5 antagonists could be used to prevent decrease in energy expenditure due to dieting or other anti-obesity treatments.2 It was also shown that the combination of food restriction and administration of an NPY Y5 antagonist was more successful in giving weight loss than either treatment alone.2\n",

Introduction of small substituents (e.g., methyl groups) on the benzyl group led to compound 6b, which exhibited a more than tenfold increase in inhibition of both OX1R and OX2R. The lipophilicity of compound 6b was, however, too high and substitution with monoaryl groups (e.g., pyridines) resulted in loss of inhibition potency. The introduction of bicyclicfused aryl substituents led to compounds 6c,d, which showed a similar increase in inhibition for both OX1R and OX2R, whilst also favorably reducing the lipophilicity. The SAR study was then carried out for substitution at position 9. When testing compounds 6d\u2013f, it was observed that OX2R inhibition was maintained in a high range, whereas OX1R values greatly varied, leading to more selective OX2R antagonists like compound 6e. For compound 6d, an excellent subnanomolar Ki was obtained for OX2R (pK\ni 9.34). When examined in vivo such compounds, containing the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane core, were found ineffective. A high blood clearance and volume distribution were found (188 ml/(min\u00b7kg) and 3.1 l/kg, respectively), along with poor c\nmax (18 nM), AUC (31 nM\u00b7h) and oral bioavailability (5%). The 2,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane performed much better in in vivo testing and it was suggested that poor in vivo performance is directly related to the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane core.27\n",

The treatment of pain in general has always been important because one out of five adults suffer from pain and one out of ten are diagnosed with chronic pain each year.28 The incidence of pain is only increasing due to population ageing and is often related to comorbidities like depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Existing pain therapies, which use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioid agents, calcium channel blockers, and antidepressants, exhibit limited efficacy and a range of side effects, limiting their usefulness in chronic pain treatment. In addition, pain is often multimodal, making the use of monomodal treatment not able to relieve all of the pain. The multimodal activity of the compounds containing the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane core against multiple receptors associated with pain or side effects related to pain could make this class of compounds of high interest in new treatments of pain.",

The side effects associated with the use of opioids are also the most severe and can include derangement, hallucination, nausea, constipation, respiratory depression, and addiction.29\n,\n30 In addition, opioids have not proven useful in the treatment of chronic pain, as demonstrated by morphine. Morphine has only a limited effectiveness against chronic pain of neuropathic or inflammatory origin, opposed to greatly diminishing acute pain. Furthermore a tolerance for morphine is built up in the body, which leads to an increase of dosage to maintain the same pain-suppressing effects. Weaker opioid analgesics, like pentazocine, are less effective at suppressing strong pain and display the same side effects, albeit less intense.31 Some of the mentioned side effects are associated with an activation of the dopamine D2 receptors.32 Antagonistic activity against the dopamine D2 receptor has also been linked to reducing the addictive effect of opioid analgetics.32 Therefore, the possible combination of \u03bc opioid and dopamine D2 antagonistic activity may lead to development of new pain-control agents with reduced or suppressed side effects.32 Studies with mice have also shown that \u03c31 receptor antagonism may also relieve neuropathic pain and address some comorbidities (e.g., anhedonia, a core symptom in depression) related to pain states.30\n",

In particular, the CXCR3 chemokine receptor is activated by three chemokines: IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC.52 CXCR3 is expressed in the T cells, B cells, and NK cells among others. T cells are known to participate in autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, type I diabetes), allergic diseases (e.g., bronchial asthma, transplanted organ rejection) and they generate interfusions in immunologic diseases (e.g., psoriasis). Since CXCR3 is involved in migration and accumulation of T cells, inhibition of CXCR3 by an antagonist could be useful in the treatment of the aforementioned diseases. In addition, CXCR3 is expressed in the neoplasm of a malignant B cell system, making a CXCR3 antagonist effective for carcinomatous immunotherapy, metastasis control in particular. All this would make CXCR3 antagonists useful therapeutic agents in treatment, prevention or suppression of carcinoma diseases (e.g., leukemia, cancer metastasis), metabolism-related diseases (e.g., diabetes), infections or diseases with an infection (e.g., AIDS, SARS), allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease, colitis ulcerosa), respiratory diseases, and neurologic diseases (e.g., infarct, thrombosis).

A main mechanism for regulating cyclic nucleotide signaling is phosphodiesterase-catalyzed cyclic nucleotide catabolism. There are 11 families of PDEs, encoded by 21 genes.59 Each gene can also yield splice variants, which increases the isozyme diversity. PDE families are functionally distinguished based on cyclic nucleotide substrate specificity, mechanisms of regulation, and sensitivity to inhibitors. PDEs are differentially expressed throughout the organism. Depending on the function and localization of the different PDE isozymes, they may serve distinctly in different physiological functions.

It has been noted that the main cause of obesity is the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TG) in adipose tissue, caused by excessive caloric intake. There are two pathways that synthesize TG: a glycerol pathway in organs and a monoacylglycerol pathway involved in aliphatic acid absorption from the small intestine. The final step in TG synthesis of both these pathways is catalyzed by diglyceride acyltransferases (DGATs).64 Of the two subtypes, DGAT1 is present in the adipose tissue, the liver, and the small intestine and is involved in lipid absorption in the small intestine, lipid accumulation in the fat cells and in the liver. DGAT1 knockout mice have been demonstrated to be resistant to fatty liver development, insulin resistance, increased fat mass, and abnormal glucose tolerance when fed a high-fat diet. In addition, energy expenditure was accelerated and transplantation of adipose tissue from DGAT1 knockout mice to wild-type mice resistant to obesity induced by a high-fat diet. On the other hand, DGAT1 overexpression in mice resulted in worsening of diabetes mellitus and obesity. These results led to the conclusion that DGAT1 inhibitors could be therapeutic drugs for treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, arteriosclerosis, lipidosis, fatty liver, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease.65\n",

As such, inhibition of CDK7 may be used for treatment of cancer, cardiac hypertrophy, and inhibition of virus replication (e.g., HIV, EBV, HCV). A study to find anticancer agents developed multiple pyrazolo[1,5-a][1, 3, 5]triazine derivatives, including one compound containing the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane moiety (compound 25) as a substituent (Fig. 29).76 The IC50 value for CDK7 inhibition of compound 25 was in the range of the lowest values of the library (\u22645 nM).",

It is believed that phosphorylation of eIF4E is necessary for its oncogenic activity.

As a result, an impressive number of research publications and patents have been published in this field. The vast array of biological properties displayed by this family of compounds opens a door for the development of new therapeutics for a variety of diseases. The synthetic strategies toward these scaffolds are determined by their substitution pattern. It is worth mentioning that most of the synthetic methods start with a 4-substituted piperidine moiety and construct the second piperidine ring from this substitution at position 4. Variable cyclization methods are used for the generation of this spiro linkage, the Pictet\u2013Spengler reaction being the method of choice for the 4,5-arene-fused scaffolds, the most common among these compounds.",
