Diseases are prescribed when there is a recognized risk to workers in an occupation and where the risk is uncommon or absent in the general population. For some occupational diseases there is a strong association with occupation and the disease rarely occurs outside work (e.g. mesothelioma, coal miner's pneumoconiosis). However, most infections are common in the general population and it is difficult to establish a causal link with the occupation. In lay terms an infection will be attributed to an occupation if it is more likely than not to be caused by that occupation. In epidemiologic terms this means an attributable fraction (the proportion of the additional risk that can be attributed to the exposure in the exposed population) of 50% or more, which equates to a relative risk of two (a doubling of the background risk caused by exposure).",
