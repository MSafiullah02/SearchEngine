Anhui and Henan provinces were at the center of the iatrogenic epidemic driven by commercial plasma donation among rural farming communities in the early 1990s, and in these provinces, there has been a key emphasis on expanding access to, and improving the quality of, HIV treatment and care services. In Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Yunnan provinces as well as Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (hereafter Xinjiang), where the epidemic was initially driven by injecting drug use, the key emphasis has been on counseling and testing, as well as active case-finding and targeted interventions, including harm reduction capacity-building and follow-up services for PLWH (Li et al. 2013). Beijing municipality, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Inner Mongolia), Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia), and Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet) have concentrated epidemics among key populations, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM; Wu et al. 2013). In these provinces, the primary emphasis has been on studying the epidemic among key populations and supporting innovative, targeted prevention, care, and treatment activities and capacity building among the local implementing units. As the collaboration has progressed, direct support has increasingly focused on those provinces and prefectures with the highest HIV prevalence, and by 2014, the focus centered on Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Sichuan\u2019s Liangshan prefecture.",

As a result, all GAP-supported provinces have established sound and smooth linkage programs for case finding and case management. For instance, the CD4 testing rate among PLWH, the percentage of eligible HIV/AIDS patients on ART, and the viral load testing rate of patients on ART in the 15 GAP-supported provinces dramatically increased from 30%, 48%, and 27% in 2008 to 71%, 90%, and 80% in 2011, respectively.

As a result, the number of sentinel surveillance sites increased sixfold during the period from 2003 to 2008, and 18,820 PLWH received diagnoses at these sites. This activity increased the coverage and quality of surveillance information available for decision-making, while also increasing local capacity for developing referral systems, care linkages, and case management capacity (Wang et al. 2010). Over the subsequent years, these surveillance sites have been transitioned to local public health authorities and continue to function as an important tool for both local and national public health decision-making. GAP has also supported an external evaluation of the adequacy of the HIV surveillance system in China (Lin et al. 2012), and the findings of this evaluation have been used by national authorities for further system strengthening (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_2 for more information).",

Again, the national program called for implementation of a public health approach based on increased rates of case finding, epidemiological investigation, CD4 testing, and follow-up services. As part of the China-US collaboration, pilot programs were established in Yunnan and Guangxi to increase the proportion of individuals who knew their status and increase the number of PLWH who completed at least two linked follow-up visits for care and support. These pilot efforts were carried out from 2006 to 2011, and the epidemiological investigation rate rose from 25% to 99% in Yunnan and 31% to 99% in Guangxi. Since 2009, these measures have served as national core indicators for all provinces, with similar improvements over time\u2014a key contributor to program success at the national level (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_23 for more information).",

Particularly in the rural areas hardest hit by the iatrogenic, plasma donation-related epidemic of the 1990s, it became apparent that the healthcare providers did not have adequate training or clinical mentoring to provide quality HIV care and treatment to increasing numbers of patients on ART. In close collaboration with the NCAIDS Division of Treatment and Care at China CDC and the Clinton Foundation, the US CDC established China\u2019s first rural AIDS Clinical Training Center in 2004 in Lixin county, Anhui province. Its mission was to provide in-service AIDS clinical training to rural clinicians selected from local Anhui and other high epidemic provinces in China. These clinicians had little training or experience dealing with patients on ART, and the Center\u2019s intensive 10-week residential training program included classroom training, direct clinical mentoring, and outreach within the local area to township and local hospitals. This approach proved extremely successful. The model was replicated in two additional provinces in the later years of the GAP collaboration, and in 2011, leadership for the training center in Anhui was transitioned to the provincial government (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_27 for more information).",

Through these pilots, stakeholders developed a better understanding of field implementation methods, which proved invaluable in the national adoption of RDS.

            "text": "An additional priority during this period was developing successful models for PMTCT of HIV, and the China-US collaboration expanded to include work within the maternal and child healthcare system. GAP helped to demonstrate that with conservative cost estimates, integrated nationwide HIV and syphilis testing of pregnant women in prenatal care in China was substantially more cost-effective than HIV screening alone (Owusu-Edusei et al. 2014). Comprehensive, integrated PMTCT efforts were highly effective in reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission to very low levels whether in rural or urban settings (Shan et al. 2014; Song et al. 2013). In 2007, GAP started to collaborate with the Guangxi Women and Community Health Bureau and the Guangxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital to pilot an integrated PMTCT program in 112 antenatal care clinics (ANCs). By fostering integration across China\u2019s three-tier health system, ANC, and ART services, this program successfully linked women with HIV infection and their children to HIV care and treatment. It was shown to be an effective model that was expanded first to the entirety of Guangxi where the approach continues to deliver results. From 2009 to 2011, 174,776 pregnant women (97%) were tested for HIV, with 728 (0.41%) diagnosed with HIV infection. HIV testing coverage during pregnancy significantly increased from 80% in 2009 to 87% in 2010 and to 91% in 2011. From 2009 to 2010, 12 out of 379 infants born to HIV-infected women tested HIV-positive, for a transmission rate of 3.2%. In part thanks to these early results, the National Center for Women and Children\u2019s Health (NCWCH) expanded coverage and implemented this program in all seven of the highest prevalence provinces in China. By 2015, the comprehensive, integrated PMTCT program was implemented nationwide by the Chinese government (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_15 for more information).",

A relatively low dosage of methadone may have been a key reason behind this (average dose was only 48 mg in 2007), as well as low training coverage and high turnover among MMT providers. Although it has been shown in other settings that higher methadone doses can lead to higher retention and other favorable MMT outcomes, it is often not practiced in the field.

The primary objective of the survey was to better understand risk perceptions and behaviors of low- to medium-fee FSW in China as well as seroprevalence rates of HIV, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in this population. A total of 1487 eligible low-fee and medium-fee FSW were recruited in the study. Findings have been published in close collaboration with NCAIDS and show that low-fee FSW were more likely to have HSV-2 infection, but not more likely to have HIV or syphilis infection, compared with medium-fee FSW. The survey also demonstrated that low-fee FSW in China have unique risks for acquiring STIs, in part due to greater economic pressures (Han et al. 2016). Tailored interventions targeting low-fee FSW, in particular, that incorporate prevailing condom use negotiation challenges are urgently needed. The potential for prevention methods alternative to male condoms has received greater attention in recent years including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and female condoms. Gaining knowledge on awareness and acceptability of these prevention methods among high-risk FSW in China will help inform the potential implementation of these prevention methods in China (see Chaps. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_3 and 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_7 for more information).",

This phase II clinical trial was primarily supported by the Division of Reproductive Health at US CDC, as well as the Guangxi Bureau of Health and the Guangxi CDC. There was limited information on antiviral therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among pregnant women coinfected with HIV and HBV (Kourtis et al. 2012). Up to 90% of infants who acquire their HBV infection perinatally will develop chronic infection. Because HIV/HBV coinfection rates are relatively high among pregnant women in Guangxi province, this study was conducted to provide unique answers to an important research question around prevention of HBV-HIV perinatal transmission to their dually exposed infants (Kourtis et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2016).",

Most conventional CD4 instruments are centrally located in provincial- and prefecture-level facilities with adequate infrastructure and skilled technicians. However, more than 70% of HIV-infected persons in China live in remote rural areas (Wu et al. 2007). Blood specimens have to be transported to centralized laboratories in a timely and secure manner in order to maintain CD4 cellular integrity. These issues are more prominent in provinces in the West and Southwest of China (e.g., Guangxi, Sichuan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Yunnan) where a large proportion of patients reside in hard-to-reach, rural, and/or mountainous areas.",

A joint study on the performance of the Alere PIMA\u2122 POC CD4 instrument was carried out in 2012 by the NHRL, Yunnan CDC, Dehong prefecture CDC, and the GAP office in China. In this study, venous and finger-prick blood samples were collected from participants with HIV infection from two VCT sites in Yunnan. Both venous and finger-prick blood specimens were collected from HIV-infected participants. This feasibility study found the PIMA POC CD4 analyzer to be a reasonable alternative to the traditionally employed flow cytometry method (using, e.g., the BD Biosciences FACSCalibur\u2122 instrument) to determine ART eligibility (Liang et al. 2015). This study found that the Alere PIMA analyzer provides satisfactory CD4 counting using venous blood but is less reliable when finger-prick blood is used. Given the frequent use of phlebotomy in rural China, the POC CD4 analyzer using venous blood could play an important role in improving HIV care in resource-limited settings in China.",

By targeting key populations for HIV prevention and early initiation of treatment as key strategies, new techniques and management concepts were introduced and adapted to the Chinese context. With valuable experiences and momentum, many of these models developed in the first decade of implementation of the GAP and NCAIDS technical collaboration were replicated and expanded nationwide. Chinese technical experts at the GAP office have a unique ability to market the evidence to key stakeholders and to build bridges at provincial and national levels. A productive working relationship with well-conceived models, a results-based activity implementation plan, and proper linkage to the domestic policy process have made significant contributions to further strengthening HIV control and prevention in China.",
