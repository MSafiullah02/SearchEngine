While a decrease in students\u2019 formal learning habits during holidays is seasonal and predictable [1], the adjustments in their learning habits during a sudden pandemic are still unresearched. The preparation of this dataset is a response to the call for inter-disciplinary research about the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic [2]. As a country that dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak very early and productively, Vietnam is a notable case study of instantaneous and conspicuous collaboration between the government and society [3]. However, the shift in the educational system was unforeseen and caused significant side effects [4]. This dataset [5] focused on the learning habits of 420 secondary students (Grade 6-12) in Hanoi during the first two weeks of school closures due to COVID-19. The dataset includes three major groups of variables: (A) Individual demographics, including family socioeconomic status (SES), school type, and occupational aspirations; (B) Students\u2019 learning habits, including hours of learning before and during the period of school suspension, with and without other people's support; and (C) Students\u2019 perceptions of their self-learning during the school closures. In addition, we added a question to measure the integration of online lessons during this time with sustainability topics. Detailed descriptions of all variables, together with the questions for each variable, and descriptive tables and figures can be found in the Mendeley data repository [5].",

Scholars have pointed out that SES factors such as monthly family income, parents\u2019 occupations, number of siblings, school type, and grade level have significant influences on students\u2019 learning habits [6,7]. This study complements the conventional notion of SES with additional variables about students\u2019 competencies. Specifically in the case of Vietnam, we added subjects for university entrance, which demonstrate students\u2019 occupational aspirations, and English, which is a crucial competency in today's world.",

All items in this section were measured using a five-point Likert scale (1: Totally Disagree, 5: Totally Agree). First, we examined students\u2019 perceptions on the necessity for self-learning during COVID-19. According to the literature on transformative learning, students\u2019 learning practices are influenced by their beliefs about learning and influences from teachers, parents, and peers [9]. Thus, we constructed the variable of \u201cstudents\u2019 necessity for self-learning\u201d using the following items: (i) to ensure my learning progress; (ii) to maintain my learning habits; (iii) influenced by teachers; (iv) influenced by parents; (v) influenced by siblings; (vi) influenced by friends. Second, we measured students\u2019 self-reports on factors that influence self-learning effectiveness. This variable consisted of different physical factors (the availability of learning resources [10], learning space [11]), psychological factors (self-motivation [12], family support [13]), and behavioural factors (concentration, goal setting [14], communication and peer collaboration [15]).",
