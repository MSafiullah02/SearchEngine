            "text": "Obstruction of the upper urinary tract has become a common cause of feline AKI in the last 20 years. The inner diameter of the feline ureter is approximately 0.4 mm (0.016 inches), making this structure highly prone to obstruction due to stricture, intraluminal concretion, mural inflammation or edema, muscular spasm, or extramural compression.4, 5 Although calcium oxalate nephroliths and ureteroliths are most frequently implicated as obstructive lesions,6 the emergence of blood stones,7 inflammation and fibrosis with smooth muscle hypertrophy of the ureteral wall (strictures),8 and circumcaval ureters9 have made advanced imaging techniques paramount for accurate presurgical identification of the cause of ureteral obstruction. This information can inform whether referral to select institutions for specific interventions (e.g., subcutaneous [SC] ureteral bypass) is indicated. The pathophysiology of AKI secondary to ureteral obstruction is complex, and most of the available information has been obtained from species other than the cat.3, 10 Pathophysiologic processes shared among various species include vasoconstriction, an influx of inflammatory cells and the release of proteolytic enzymes, and fibroblast recruitments with resultant fibroplasia.",

            "text": "In the authors' experience, the most commonly cited differential diagnosis for AKI (alone or superimposed on pre-existing chronic kidney disease [CKD]) is pyelonephritis. A definitive diagnosis of pyelonephritis requires identification of bacteria within the urine collected by pyelocentesis, but this procedure is rarely performed due to the associated risks of uroretroperitoneum, uroperitoneum, or urosepsis. Therefore, this diagnosis is frequently made based on the ultrasonographic appearance of the renal pelves with or without a positive bacterial culture of urine obtained by cystocentesis. The use of renal pelvic dimensions for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis is problematic for several reasons. First, there appears to be a large overlap in renal pelvic dimensions among healthy cats and cats with a variety of renal diseases, including pyelonephritis.16 Second, the association between renal pelvic dilation and pyelonephritis was largely shaped by an experimental study in which pyelonephritis was induced in cats by ligation of the ureter and intravenous injection of Escherichia coli.\n17 Finally, in other species (particularly humans), imaging criteria for pyelonephritis do not typically include the degree of renal pelvic dilation that is accepted as supportive for this disorder in veterinary medicine.18 For these reasons, despite its ubiquity as a presumptive diagnosis for AKI, the true incidence and importance of this disease in the feline population are currently unknown.",

Furthermore, epidemiologic data likely varies, depending on the underlying etiology of AKI. For example, the patient population susceptible to unilateral ureteral obstructions resulting in uremic complications (i.e., typically middle-aged to older cats with underlying CKD) is likely different from the population at greatest risk for AKI secondary to lily exposure (i.e., young, curious cats). Lastly, the limited data that is available characterizing feline AKI has been generated from single institutions with limited patient and client demographics and geographic range.

Recent standardization of the definition and stratification of severity of AKI in human medicine has not only allowed for more applicable epidemiologic studies but has allowed for the extraction of more clinically meaningful results from various clinical trials. The two most widely accepted schemes for defining and classifying human AKI are the Risk Injury Failure End-Stage Kidney Disease (RIFLE) scheme and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN), the latter of which was developed by modification of the former, with the intent to improve the sensitivity of detection of AKI.23, 24 Both sets of criteria appear to perform equally well when both sensitivity for detection of AKI and predictive ability for adverse outcomes are evaluated; therefore, these schemes have become accepted within the human nephrology community as the standard means of defining AKI for epidemiologic characterization. Based on several obstacles preventing application of these schemes to the feline population, Cowgill recently proposed a veterinary staging scheme designed for application to the veterinary population (Table 50-1\n).25 This proposed scheme has yet to be validated for clinical utility in cats.",

However, inaccurate assessment of hydration status by physical examination parameters is common, and many euhydrated and overhydrated patients are erroneously categorized as dehydrated. Other findings may include halitosis, scleral injection, bradycardia, cutaneous bruising, peripheral edema, melena, and diarrhea. Oral mucosa ulceration and necrosis are common in patients with severe uremia. These findings may be due to the phenomenon of either uremic calciphylaxis or uremic stomatitis. Although the anatomic distribution and histologic lesions vary between these two processes, the gross appearance may be similar (i.e., ulceration).26, 27 Further work is warranted to better characterize these lesions because appropriate treatment may vary. Many of the aforementioned physical examination findings may be secondary to uremia, the primary disease process resulting in AKI (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation, vasculitis), or concurrent extra-renal organ injury (e.g., pancreatitis). Hypothermia is a frequent finding, and in the absence of circulatory shock, is thought to be associated with alteration of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory set point secondary to the influence of uremia.28 Normothermia or hyperthermia may be suggestive of an infectious, inflammatory, or immune-mediated etiology.",

The presence of underlying CKD can have serious implications in determining a patient's prognosis and potential for renal recovery and can influence a cat owner's willingness to pursue the intensive treatment often necessary to maximize the likelihood of a positive outcome. Clinicopathologic data characterizing prior renal function is frequently not available, however, making subtle historical and physical examination findings vital in assessing the likelihood of underlying CKD. Body fat and muscle condition can provide insight into the chronicity of renal or extra-renal disease. Careful palpation of the kidneys can aid in assessment of renal size and shape (e.g., small size or irregular contours of kidneys are often detected in association with CKD). A more sensitive means of assessing these characteristics is visualization with radiography or ultrasonography. Although the use of imaging, clinicopathologic techniques, and (rarely) renal histopathology can be helpful for cases in which underlying CKD is not readily apparent, many feline AKI cases with an underlying chronic component can be identified by a thorough questioning of the owner and physical examination.",

Although the presence of anemia can be due to a multitude of causes, this abnormality has important implications for both determination of chronicity and planning for treatment options, such as hemodialysis. Although anemia can be a complication of both acute and CKD, it is more frequently encountered and is more frequently severe (i.e., hematocrit less than 20%) in cases with an underlying chronic component. A moderate to severely anemic cat will almost assuredly require a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion during an extended course of treatment, given the need for serial blood sampling. Therefore, the availability of donor blood products, as well as blood typing and crossmatching capabilities, should be determined near the time of initial presentation. Although the leukon frequently displays abnormalities consistent with a stress or inflammatory response, changes such as the presence of a left shift (circulating band neutrophils) may indicate more clinically significant inflammation, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (with or without concurrent sepsis).",

Ionized calcium concentrations are normal or low, provided that hypercalcemia is not the cause of the AKI. Ethylene glycol intoxication causes a profound ionized hypocalcemia, due to both severe hyperphosphatemia and chelation of calcium by oxalate. The anion gap is usually high secondary to retained organic and inorganic acids, but it can be normal early in the course of disease, or if hypoalbuminemia is present.

The urine specific gravity is frequently isosthenuric (1.007 to 1.015) in cases of intrinsic failure. A urine dipstick may reveal any combination of glucosuria (without hyperglycemia), proteinuria, bilirubinuria, and hemoglobinuria, depending on the underlying etiology. Care must be taken to obtain a thorough history, however, as administration of various medications (e.g., ascorbic acid, cephalexin, enrofloxacin) can interfere with the results of certain assays aimed at detecting glucosuria.29, 30 Proteinuria is frequently present, but qualitative (dipstick) and quantitative (urine protein : creatinine ratio) severity can vary within a specific etiology. Dipstick assessment of proteinuria has limited value in cats, due to discordance with urine protein : creatinine ratios.31 The urine pH is usually acidic, unless there is a concurrent bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI). Careful microscopic assessment of urine sediment may disclose pyuria (suggestive of nephritis), dysmorphic RBCs (suggestive of glomerular disease, an uncommon diagnosis in the cat), or casts (most frequently granular, but red and white blood cell casts are uncommonly observed). In human medicine, eosinouria has historically been associated with acute interstitial nephritis (secondary to a drug reaction). However, more recent publications have shown that this finding lacks the satisfactory test characteristics to make it useful in the identification of this specific etiology.32 Calcium oxalate crystals present in large numbers are supportive of ethylene glycol intoxication, although a few oxalate crystals may be present in the urine of healthy patients. Crystalluria is a common in vitro artifact that is secondary to prolonged storage of urine prior to analysis.33 An in-house variation of a Romanowsky stain is frequently useful for detailed assessment of red and white blood cell morphology, as well as for the identification of bacteria. A bacterial urine culture is important to confirm the presence of a UTI and to guide antimicrobial therapy.",

The presence of ultrasonographic changes consistent with CKD does not preclude the possibility of a superimposed acute injury and, thus, the potential for at least partial renal recovery. Likewise, normal ultrasonographic renal architecture does not rule out the possibility of CKD. Perirenal fluid is commonly seen with a variety of etiologies of AKI and can also be seen secondary to volume overload. Aspiration and analysis of the perirenal fluid is typically unrewarding, because the fluid can be viscous, resulting in an inability to collect a sufficient volume for analysis.34 A renal ultrasonographic finding described as subcapsular hypoechoic thickening has been described in cats undergoing fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or needle biopsy of the kidney. The presence of renal subcapsular hypoechoic thickening has a reasonably high positive predictive value for the identification of renal lymphoma (80.9%), but the negative predictive value (66.7%) does not allow for lymphoma to be ruled out in the absence of this finding.35\n",

Potential exists, however, for stent encrustation, obstruction, and/or migration. Additionally, in some cases, the presence of a ureteral stricture prevents stent placement.

Colloidal support may also be considered to reduce the total amount of fluid administered if oliguria or anuria is suspected to be secondary to severe deficits in renal perfusion, although no benefit over crystalloid therapy has been documented in human or veterinary medicine.42 Historically, synthetic colloids have been considered to have a volumetric equivalence ratio of 1 : 4 compared to crystalloids.43 However, evidence suggests that the true, overall volume-sparing benefit of colloids is far less.44 Furthermore, evidence compiled in multiple meta-analyses in humans suggests that synthetic colloidal solutions may have a deleterious effect not only on renal function, but overall survival, especially in septic patients.45, 46 For these reasons, it is the authors' opinion that colloids should be used with caution and only be considered in the resuscitative phase of fluid therapy. In the resuscitative phase, goal-directed therapy to restore surrogate markers of perfusion (e.g., blood pressure, venous lactate concentration, venous oxygen saturation) should be employed with endpoints set to be reached within 24 hours. If oliguria or anuria is present and persists despite achievement of normal surrogate markers of perfusion, additional fluid administration should be withheld to avoid fluid overload. Avoidance of fluid overload (typically defined as fluid accumulation greater than 10% of baseline body weight) is essential, because there is ample evidence documenting the association between fluid overload and worse clinical outcomes in both humans47, 48, 49, 50 and, more recently, dogs.51\n",

Insensible losses have been estimated to range between 12 and 29 mL/kg/day55, 56 and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as patient activity level, underlying disease process, and body temperature. Careful attention must be given to serial changes in the patient's body weight, because peracute fluctuations in weight are most likely due to changes in fluid balance rather than changes in lean muscle or fat content. High maintenance fluid rates have been historically advocated for patients producing urine, based on the rationale that high volume fluid administration beyond that which is necessary to restore normal volume status will improve GFR.

In fact, there is little or no clinical evidence in human or veterinary medicine that diuretics improve outcome in established AKI. It has been postulated that the ability to respond to diuretics is a marker of less severe renal injury associated with a better prognosis. However, an increase in urine output after diuretic administration does not necessarily coincide with an increase in uremic solute excretion and, therefore, does not preclude the need for renal replacement therapy if severe uremia or acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities persist. In veterinary medicine, because renal replacement therapies are not readily available, diuretic administration plays a large role in volume management. Conversion from an oliguric or anuric state to normal urine production or polyuria may enhance the clinician's ability to prevent or manage fluid overload and thus allow administration of necessary medications and nutrition that would otherwise contribute to fluid overload.",

However, the use of loop diuretics predominates in both human and veterinary AKI patients due to the relatively high efficacy and safety margin of these drugs, compared to the osmotic diuretics. There are several potential adverse effects associated with the administration of mannitol. Mannitol is typically administered in concentrations ranging from 20% to 25%, which correspond to osmolalities of 1100 to 1373 mOsm/L, and this high osmolality can contribute to fluid overload by promoting water movement from the intracellular to extracellular space. Furthermore, administration of mannitol has been associated with the development of a renal tubular morphologic lesion called osmotic nephrosis.\n61 This lesion is characterized by swelling and vacuolization of the renal tubules and resultant renal tubular dysfunction and obstruction. Cumulative doses of approximately 200 g/person/day have been associated with this lesion, but when baseline renal function is normal, the toxic dose appears to be significantly higher.62 When extrapolating a dose of 200 g for a 70 kg (154 lb) human to that for a 5 kg (11 lb) feline patient, the g/kg cumulative dosage frequently found in many veterinary textbooks (0.25 to 1 g/kg bolus a variable number of times, followed by 1 to 2 mg/kg/min as a constant rate infusion) reaches the human nephrotoxic dose. For these reasons, the author does not recommend the use of mannitol as a diuretic for AKI.",

For example, the most commonly used concentration of sodium bicarbonate is 8.4% (2000 mOsm/L). The osmole load administered with this formulation is considerable, and volumes necessary to correct acid-base derangements may easily result in hypernatremia. Therefore, an alternative strategy for administration of this medication is dilution with sterile water and IV administration at the desired maintenance parenteral fluid rate (provided the patient is not anuric or severely polyuric). In the authors' experience, this practice allows for gradual (over 24 hours) correction of acidemia and avoidance of rapid administration of a large solute load. In cases of oliguria or anuria, it is difficult to provide supplementary, parenteral alkali without provoking solute and fluid perturbations. In these cases, hemodialysis is indicated to correct acid-base derangements.

However, electrocardiographic abnormalities are variable and difficult to predict based on the degree of hyperkalemia. Concurrent acidemia and hypocalcemia likely potentiate the effect of hyperkalemia on cardiac conduction. Therefore, addressing these abnormalities may mitigate the adverse effects of hyperkalemia. Severe hyperkalemia can lead to a ventricular fibrillation or standstill. There are a variety of pharmacologic treatments available for severe hyperkalemia, but these therapies act to translocate potassium to the intracellular space or increase the resting membrane potential to allow repolarization of excitable cells, rather than enhance excretion of potassium.

Nonetheless, correction of acidemia may mitigate the deleterious effects of hyperkalemia on cardiac conduction. Loop diuretics can promote kaliuresis in the distal nephron by promoting tubular flow. Although conversion from an oliguric state to one of increased urine production assists in management of electrolyte excesses (such as hyperkalemia), the authors have treated several patients whose hyperkalemia persisted despite resumption of urine production. Furthermore, loop diuretics are not a reliable means of increasing urine production in cases of anuric AKI.

Human guidelines do not support protein restriction for patients with AKI.85, 86 Furthermore, some disease states associated with AKI promote a hypercatabolic state and, therefore, may result in greater protein requirements than the established maintenance requirements. Patients treated with dialysis may actually require more protein than patients with extra-renal disease, due to loss of amino acids in dialysate/filtrate.

Therefore, treatment of the feline patient poses some important problems regarding blood volume regulation and RBC transfusion requirements. First, the size of the extracorporeal circuit determines the amount of blood that must circulate outside of the patient's body during the treatment. The smallest circuits currently used in veterinary medicine are approximately 60 mL. In a typical 5 kg (11 lb) cat with a normal RBC concentration, removal of this volume of RBCs should not contribute greatly to overall cardiovascular instability. However, removal of this volume of blood can be catastrophic in a smaller patient (e.g., 2.5 kg [5.5 lb]) that is anemic. Second, the chemical composition of some of the available hollow fiber membranes affects the tendency for blood to clot or to adhere to the fibers. If a large volume of the patient's blood remains within the fibers following attempts to return blood to the patient at the end of the treatment, significant blood loss accompanies each treatment. For these reasons, the authors recommend that any institution providing extracorporeal renal replacement therapies for cats have access to a plentiful donor RBC supply. Lastly, the extracorporeal circuits must be primed with either a crystalloid, colloid, or blood product prior to treatment. The priming solution represents a volume load obligatory to commencement of treatment. Therefore, ultrafiltration (plasma water removal) of at least the extracorporeal circuit must be achieved to maintain a neutral fluid balance throughout the treatment, unless the clinician plans to discard the blood present in the circuit following completion of the treatment. Ultrafiltration of any volume of plasma water may be difficult in patients that are hemodynamically unstable.",

A recent meta-analysis showed superiority of proton pump inhibitors versus H2 receptor antagonists in the prevention of stress-related mucosal bleeding.94 These results, in combination with the potential for accumulation of H2 receptor antagonists in patients with diminished renal function, favor the use of proton pump inhibitors.

            "text": "Dopamine is a pharmacologic treatment for AKI that has fallen out of favor with both human and veterinary nephrologists. Dopamine was initially advocated for its perceived augmentation of renal blood flow. Its benefit in cats, however, was doubted as it was originally thought that cats did not possess renal dopamine receptors, a concept supported by the absence of changes in urine output, sodium excretion, or GFR in cats administered a low-dose dopamine infusion.97 However, a putative dopamine receptor (DA-1) has been identified in the feline renal cortex.98 Regardless of this recent discovery, the evidence available assessing the effect of dopamine on the feline kidney, when infused via the IV and intra-arterial routes, suggests that an increase in renal blood flow is not due to the renal effects of dopamine, but rather to the systemic cardiovascular effects.99 Furthermore, the observed increase in urine flow is likely due to a combination of these systemic effects and an alteration in renal tubular function.99 Fenoldopam is a drug that has received recent interest as a pharmacologic treatment option for feline AKI, because the feline DA-1 receptors show higher affinity for this drug versus dopamine.98 Although a prolonged infusion of fenoldopam increased creatinine clearance and urine output in healthy cats,100 the authors are unaware of any evidence of efficacy in conversion from an oliguric or anuric state in clinical cases of feline AKI. The authors do not recommend this drug as a first-line treatment, because the expense, undetermined efficacy, and unknown pharmacokinetic properties in feline AKI are major drawbacks to its use.",
