We counted whole blood\u2013derived (WBD) platelets as individual units, not pools; the proportion of WBD platelets issued as prepooled doses from blood centers (and therefore subject to recall as 1 unit, not 5) was not given in the survey. Using this denominator, the recall rate for the annualized 2011 data was 1 in 5800 units, one-third of the rates seen in earlier years.

The annual numbers of recall BPDs in Figure 1 do not correlate precisely with the annual recalls in the FDA Enforcement Reports because the latter reports lag months or years behind the recall actions. We excluded Enforcement Report recalls of units for further manufacture (eg, source plasma) from our analysis. However, the 2011 rate of 1072 blood component recalls per year in the Enforcement Reports is of similar magnitude to the BPD statistics of 1189 and 838 potential recalls in the preceding FY 2009 and 2010.",

These modified rules incorporated donor nucleic acid testing (NAT). The FDA issued a May 2010 guidance on donor HIV and HCV NAT, which included test result algorithms on which donors needed to have a lookback performed and a December 2010 guidance on performing HCV lookback [16], [17]. In some cases, donors with ambiguous HIV NAT results must still have lookbacks performed as a precaution. All historical lookbacks on donors identified before February 2008, which permitted the hospital transfusion service 1 year to trace and notify recipients, were to have been completed by 2009. For current lookbacks, the consignees have 12 weeks to make reasonable attempts to complete their notifications. However, the CMS rule says if the hospital cannot locate the recipient, it can document in the patient medical record extenuating circumstances beyond the hospital's control as to why more than 12 weeks was needed [14]. Either the patient or the physician of record can be notified by the transfusion service or the hospital, but in either case, the recipient must be notified, according to commentary accompanying the rules changes [13]. For deceased recipients of HIV lookback units (in case of potential exposure to others) and for legally incompetent or minor recipients, the next of kin or legal representative must be notified. These rule changes also increased the FDA requirement for record retention of all blood component dispositions from 5 to 10 years [12], [18].",

As part of the British response to this concern, transfusion recipients from donors who later developed vCJD are notified [30], [31]. In May 2010, the FDA issued guidance on CJD and vCJD donor issues, which included recommendations about recipient notification [10]. Notification was not recommended for recipients from donors deferred for vCJD geographical risk, use of bovine insulin, a single family member with CJD, or transfusions in Britain or France. (The FDA is considering whether to add Saudi Arabia to the vCJD risk regions [32].) For donors younger than 55 years subsequently found to have vCJD, suspected vCJD, or CJD, the FDA requests telephone notification and a BPD report from the collection facility as soon as possible, for review with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For donors with CJD, suspected or diagnosed vCJD, or other risk factors, \u201cconsignee notification could enable the consignee to inform the physician\u2026so that medically appropriate notification and counseling may be performed at the discretion of health care providers.\u201d There is still no evidence to date of transfusion transmission of traditional CJD [33]. Transfusion services receiving a notice about donor CJD or vCJD may contact the FDA or the CDC for the most current advice on recipient counseling and evaluation.",

The CDC has added information about deferring blood donations to the malaria section of its Yellow Book for travel medicine [46]. However, unrecognized malaria risk travel is still the most common single reason for BPDs in blood components (Fig 1). Donor travel to Mexico has been scrutinized in recent years. Malaria (Plasmodium vivax) has drastically declined in Mexico from historical levels, with reported cases down 98% from 1985 to 2005. Although Mexican travel is probably the most common locale for malaria deferrals in US donors, detailed analysis of local malaria infections by the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II group showed that three-fourths of US donors deferred for Mexican travel went to areas where little or no local malaria is occurring, such as Quintana Roo (Cancun and Cozumel region, Yucatan peninsula) [45]. The FDA Blood Products Advisory Committee recommended in 2009 to lift the deferral for travelers to rural Quintana Roo, and the FDA's June 2012 draft guidance would do so, if adopted [20], [45]. The Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II group estimated that with the exception of Oaxaca, which accounted for less than 3% of US donor deferrals for Mexican travel, the risk of malaria transmission from US blood donors returning from Mexico might be around 1 unit every 20 years nationwide [45]. Given this low probability, in our practice, we are not notifying the transfused patient's physician when Mexico is the donor's travel risk.",

Workers in South Korea studied blood donors who were taking retinoids and their transfusion recipients. Thirty-two percent of donors on these drugs and 2 of 41 recipients of blood products from such donors had detectable plasma drug levels [55], [56]. Nine women with pregnancies during or after such transfusions had no problems in their babies, although none of them were transfused during the first trimester, the greatest period of risk [57], [58]. If a pregnant woman receives a blood component from a donor who should have been deferred for teratogenic medication use, we would notify the patient's physician, but the risk from acitretin-exposed donors appears to be very low.",

In newly infected blood donors, the initial WP is thought to be only 1 to 2 days of rapid ramp-up, followed typically by 6 to 9 days of viremia detectable as routinely tested in plasma with pooled NAT [67]. Then a \u201ctail\u201d of lower-level viremia has been detected for up to 3 months [68]. Donors could be infectious but NAT negative in the early or late stages of this sequence, depending in part on test sensitivity, for example, switching to more sensitive individual-donor NAT when infections are identified locally. Whole blood specimens are under investigation for donor testing because they have higher WNV levels than plasma in the convalescent phase [68]. For assessment of a recently potentially exposed transfusion recipient, the CDC's recommendations on acute and convalescent anti-WNV serology in suspected illness may be consulted [69].",

Still, by our estimates, there may be more than 108 000 blood components annually in the United States\u2014about 1 (0.4%) in 250\u2014which, after issuance, are found to be out of compliance. Transfusion services have become accustomed to these notices, and accrediting bodies require procedures for managing them. However, familiarity should not preclude local and national efforts to improve practices and reduce problems in this arena. We offer the following suggestions for quality improvement and prevention of blood component recalls and market withdrawals.1.\nImprove data availability and analysis. The FDA publishes weekly raw data on recalls but should also publish annual summaries, as is done for BPDs. Better yet would be an interactive database for organizing and searching public information on these and all other recalls.2.\nImprove donor screening. Numerous problems have been identified that may contribute to false-negative deferral screening, but demonstrations of successful interventions are scarce. Better screening might even reduce unnecessary deferrals, as was observed in one malaria travel project [87].3.\nImprove processes to notify transfusion services and transfusing physicians. The Canadian analysis indicated needs for better communications to hospitals about problems with donors or components [41]. When there are infectious disease concerns about a donor, supplying information on whether the donor was subsequently tested and the most recent results, if any, is a simple but helpful measure.4.Improve knowledge of the medical consequences of transfusing nonconforming blood components. Other than HIV/HCV lookback, little information has been collected on the outcomes in transfusion recipients or the concerns of their physicians.5.Use outcomes knowledge from recipients to better inform the donor screening process. This would help complete the quality improvement loop from donors to recipients and back to donors again.\n",
