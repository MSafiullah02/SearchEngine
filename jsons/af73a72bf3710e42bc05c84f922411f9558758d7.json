[1] [2] [3] The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection in a large data set in nonpregnant patients from China were fever (99%), fatigue (70%), cough (59%), shortness of breath (31%), myalgias (35%), headache (6.5%), sore throat (17%), diarrhea (10%), nausea (10%), and vomiting (4%). 4 An additional manifestation noted among patients with COVID-19 infection is the sudden loss (or reduction) of the sense of smell and taste, which is currently recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head With increasing numbers of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) cases due to efficient human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States, preparation for the unpredictable setting of labor and delivery is paramount. The priorities are 2-fold in the management of obstetric patients with COVID-19 infection or persons under investigation (PUI): (1) caring for the range of asymptomatic to critically ill pregnant and postpartum women; (2) protecting health care workers and beyond from exposure during the delivery hospitalization (health care providers, personnel, family members).

In addition, women infected with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic until their admission in labor and beyond, 6 which in itself poses a significant risk of exposure for their family members (including the newborn) and all providers involved in their clinical care.",

A sideby-side comparison of recommendations from many professional societies for labor and delivery units is presented in Table 1 . For institutions with multiple labor and delivery sites, consideration should be given to designating 1 institution to care for patients with COVID-19 infection. This proved useful in managing patients during the SARS epidemic and for cases in the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. [11] [12] [13] Resource allocation within the Labor and Delivery Unit as well as other units (including intensive care unit) should be proactively addressed. It is imperative to establish a back-up team to care for patients without COVID-19 infection due to the time-intensive tasks of donning/doffing PPE, transporting the patient, providing anesthetic care, and performing surgery in patients with active COVID-19 infection.",

Early multidisciplinary collaboration should be arranged to determine level of care, fetal monitoring, and delivery plan. Discussion of the risks and benefits for administering steroids for fetal lung maturity, magnesium for neuroprotection, and indomethacin for tocolysis should be addressed, since there is concern those drugs may worsen COVID-19 infection (Table 2) . 9 Avoiding urgent cesarean delivery is essential to reduce the risk for general anesthesia and provider exposure during uncontrolled transfers to the operating room. Therefore, ongoing assessment of both maternal and fetal statuses are key to balance risks of prolonged labor versus cesarean delivery. It is unclear whether uterine decompression improves maternal respiratory status and how the potential benefit balances against the known operative risks in the setting of COVID-19. On the other hand, prolonged maternal hypoxemia may ultimately cause fetal acidemia, leading to a more urgent cesarean delivery. 9 Routine monitoring should include frequent vital signs (tailored to the current clinical status and adjusted as necessary) with the addition of continuous pulse oximetry and strict input and output measurements to assure fluid restriction. Pulse oximetry goal should be an oxygen saturation \u226595%. Early warning criteria systems specific for obstetric patients may aid in early detection and prompt escalation of care. 16 Women requiring supplemental oxygen, who develop increasing oxygen requirements or worsening hypoxia (pulse oximetry [Spo 2 ] < 95%), should have prompt arterial blood gas analysis with frequent clinical reassessment to guide the requirement for escalation of care and mechanical ventilation. Highflow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation may be considered as temporizing measures but are generally discouraged due to the potential for greater aerosolization. In addition, increasing oxygen requirements serve as a marker of disease progression, with increasing risk of atelectasis and pulmonary consolidation. It is recommended to perform early endotracheal intubation in a controlled manner minimizing exposure to health care workers and equipment with airborne precautions in an urgent/emergent situation. 17 One of the frequent complications of patients with COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome The routine use of oxygen for fetal indications should be suspended",

In fact, early epidural placement is desirable to avoid exacerbation of respiratory symptoms with labor pain and to reduce the likelihood of general anesthesia if intrapartum cesarean delivery becomes needed. The benefits of neuraxial analgesia in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia are 2-fold: (1) for the patient, it will help avoid any exacerbation of respiratory status with intubation and mechanical ventilation and (2) for health care providers, it reduces the risks associated with aerosol exposure and transmission of COVID-19 infection during intubation and extubation, if general anesthesia is provided.",

Have the most experienced anesthesiologist perform the procedure to ensure adequate placement and reduce the risk of accidental dural puncture that may require an epidural blood patch. 6. Increase the dosing of neuraxial medications for labor analgesia (eg, increasing the bupivacaine concentration from 0.0625% to 0.1%) or changing the setting of the programmed epidural intermittent bolus (eg, increasing the volume from 5 to 8 mL, or decreasing the interval from every 45 to 30 minutes) or adding neuraxial adjuvants (eg, epidural clonidine) to minimize intrapartum breakthrough pain requiring epidural top-up. 7. Round on parturients with video or phone calls into the patient's room for hourly assessments of general status and effects of neuraxial analgesia. spinal-epidural, epidural procedures all are acceptable, and no technique confers more risk that the other based on the literature available. None of the patients experienced neurologic sequelae. Current recommendations on the use of nitrous oxide (Entonox) for labor analgesia suggest \"there is insufficient information about the cleaning, filtering, and potential aerosolization of nitrous oxide in the setting of COVID-19.\" Individual Labor and Delivery Units should consider suspending use. 9 Additionally, the practice of high-flow oxygen for fetal distress does not improve fetal outcomes and should be suspended due to the risk of aerosolization. 9 ANESTHESIA FOR CESAREAN DELIVERY In reports from China, most women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection underwent a cesarean delivery. 25 In the absence of universal testing and rapid availability of results, COVID-19 status may not necessarily be known at the time of cesarean delivery. The baseline failure rate for conversion of labor epidural analgesia to cesarean delivery anesthesia is 5%. 30 Urgent intrapartum cesarean delivery represents an important risk factor for failed conversion from intrapartum neuraxial labor analgesia to cesarean delivery anesthesia-therefore, ongoing communication with the obstetricians is crucial to allow safe transfer to the operating room, and adequate time for initiation of surgical block to avoid general anesthesia. 30 To minimize the risk of exposure during urgent endotracheal intubation, airborne protection (N95 respirator mask) is recommended for all providers in the operating room unless the patient is known to be COVID-19 negative.",
