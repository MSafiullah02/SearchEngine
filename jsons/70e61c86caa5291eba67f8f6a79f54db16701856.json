Practically the experience of carring NIMV on patients with ARF on early stadies of MOSF is absent. Until now, the criteria of uneffectiveness of NIMV and indications for cessation of mask ventilation and moving of patients to mechanical ventilation are not determined. METHODS. There were included 48 patients with ALI in the examination. The cause of this condition was the MOSF, developed in postoperative period. Diagnosis of ALI/ARDS was stated on the criteria adopted The American European Consensus Conference on ARDS (1). Presence of organs failure was determined on Multiple organ dysfunction score (Table 1) . NIMV was carried out by seances from 5 to 8 hours. Average duration of NIMV consisted 39.5\u00b15.3 hours. RESULTS. Improvement of gases change was determined on 28 patients (58%) out of 48. Though 20 patients with MOSF were reintubated, out of which 13 patients (27%) died lately as the result of MOSF progressing. The condition of gases changing functions before intubation is one of the determining factors of prognosis. The patients reintubated under satisfactory indices of gase blood composition and early symptoms of MOSF survived. Patients, who were reintubated on decreased indices of arterial oxygenation under MOSF progressing died in 100% cases ( NIMV is effective method in complex therapy of ARF, developing in postoperative period after cardiac surgery, that leads to significant improvement of lungs biomechanics and gases change function. Progressing of MOSF and storage disturbance of lung oxygenation is absolute indication for intubation and applications of special regimes of mechanical ventilation. REFERENCES. 1.

Several bioimpedance cardiac output systems have been developed in the past in order to measure cardiac output in a wide variety of clinical situations. However, open thorax surgery negatively influences the accuracy of the measurement of thoracic electrical bioimpedance cardiac output (TEB-CO) (1). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of a new bioimpedance cardiograph HL-4 (Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre Amsterdam and Hemologic Amersfoort, The Netherlands), using a new algorithm and a new electrode configuration, during open and closed chest in CABG patients, comparing TEB-CO with transcardiopulmonary thermodilution (TCPCO). METHODS. After Hospital Ethics Committee approval and written informed consent, fourteen patients with preserved LV-function at cineangiography or echocardiography, scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting were included. For the TEB system two current injecting electrodes were placed on the forehead and the left thigh respectively and two voltage sensing electrodes were used: one above the left clavicle at the base of the neck and the other at the level of the xyphoid in the left midaxillary line. For TCPCO, the PiCCO-system (Pulsion, Munich, Germany) was used. Hemodynamic measurements were recorded at three time points: t1 before the operation, t2 after weaning from bypass before sternal closure and t3 after sternal closure. TEB-CO and TCPCO data were compared with Pearson's r correlation coeficient. p<0.05 was considered significant. Bland-Altman analysis (2) with bias and precision was carried out at each of the three time points. RESULTS. Ten males and 4 females with age 64\u00b19 yr, body weight 78 \u00b1 13 kg and height 172\u00b18 cm were included. A total of 34 matched data pairs were available for analysis. Table 1 shows the results of correlation, bias and precision of the measurements at the three different time points. TEB consistently underestimated TCPCO. At all time points, there was a good correlation between both techniques. INTRODUCTION.

All patients received morphine analgesia. Quality of sedation was assessed hourly in all patients.\"Adequate sedation\" was pre-defined as a set interval on the Bloomsbury Sedation scale. Additionally, the patient's nurse determined if sedation over the previous hour in general had been adequate or not. Time from discontinuation of the sedative drug until the patient followed verbal command and to extubation was compared between groups. In the isoflurane group a gas evacuation system was used during isoflurane administration. Athmospheric concentration of isoflurane was measured at 0.5 m from the ACD. RESULTS. In the isoflurane group patients were adequately sedated by the Bloomsbury Scale for 58 \u00b1 9 % of the study period, compared to 50 \u00b1 28 % in the control group.Nurse satisfaction in the isoflurane group was 88 % of time and 57% of time in the control group.Mean time to extubation after cessation of sedative administration was 11 min in the isoflurane group and 1864 min in the control group, mean time to patient cooperation was 55 min in the isoflurane group, and 1866 min in the control group. No significant hemodynamic changes were noted at initiation of the sedation in either of the groups. No serious complications related to sedation were noted in either group.Opioid requirements in the isoflurane group were lower, with a mean rate of 1.6 0.9 mg/hr, compared with a mean rate of 4.2 2.4 mg/hr in the control group.Mean isoflurane infusion rate was 2.5 ml/hr, with mean end-tidal isoflurane concentrations of 0.37% (0.19-0.82%).Environmental levels of isoflurane were generally low,with a mean of 0.43 \u00b1 0.27 ppm, well below the recommended long-term exposure limit of 2 ppm. Brief peaks (<2min) between 2 and 15 ppm were noted during endotracheal suctioning, etc on an average of 0.1 times/hour of exposure. CONCLUSION. Isoflurane administered via the ACD for sedation of ICU patients is environmentally safe, requires small volumes of isoflurane and may provide better quality of sedation than midazolam. It appears to be more titratable with a shorter time from adequate sedation to extubation and ability to cooperate. REFERENCES.

            "text": "Increased capillary permeability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS and organ failures. Surgery and ischaemia-reperfusion injury are both associated with stimulation of the acute inflammatory response, an early feature of which is an increase in systemic capillary permeability. The kidneys amplify small changes in systemic capillary permeability (1).The aim of this study was to explore any association between ACR during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and subsequent pulmonary and renal function. METHODS. Forty patients (9 female) mean (range) age 67.8 (50-85) yrs undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were enrolled. Patients with severely impaired left ventrICUlar function (<35% EF) were excluded. Ten mL of urine was collected at intervals from the start of surgery until 48 hours post CPB. Microalbuminuria was measured by automated immunoturbidimetry and expressed as the albumin creatinine ratio (ACR: ref. range <2.3 mg/mmol). ACR was compared with pO2/FiO2 ratio, hours on IPPV, renal function and duration of inotropic support, using Spearman's rank correlation procedure. RESULTS. Two patients were excluded (death at 6 hours and acute renal failure post CPB). The median (range) duration of IPPV was 15 (4-72) hours. 22 patients required inotropic support for median (range) 12 (2-96) hours. Median (range) ACR increased during surgery and was maximal 10 minutes post CPB. (Table) Two hour ACR was inversely correlated with the mean pO2/FiO2 ratio up to 12 hours (rs = -0.46 p = 0.0044). Two and 12 hour ACRs were both positively associated with duration of IPPV (rs = 0.46 p = 0.0071 and 0.62 p <0.0001 respectively). ACR at 4 and 12 hours were associated with serum creatinine 24 hours post CPB, (rs = 0.35 p = 0.045, rs = 0.50 p = 0.003 respectively). ACR at 2, 4 and 12 hours post CPB were associated with serum creatinine 48 hours post CPB (rs = 0.45 p = 0.033, rs = 0.59 p = 0.003 and rs = 0.49 p = 0.016 respectively). There was no significant association between duration of inotropic support and ACR at any time point up to 48 hours. CONCLUSION. CPB leads to a perioperative microvascular insult, causing increased capillary permeability which influences later pulmonary and renal function. These rapid changes in microvascular permeability can be monitored as the ACR, and in the patient group studied, the magnitude of the ACR as early as 2 hrs post CPB is associated with later organ function. ACR may provide a tool allowing early identification of patients at risk of developing organ dysfunction, who may benefit from early intervention aimed at modifying the inflammatory response. ",

Whether additional bacterial toxins play a role in the development of acute pulmonary inflammation during gram-negative sepsis remains an unresolved issue. Flagellin, a principal component of bacterial flagella, has been recently shown to elicit immune responses via activation of the toll-like receptor 5 (2). We have newly found that flagellin induces an expression of ICAM-1 and a massive production of IL-8 by human lung epithelial cells. In mice, flagellin produces a severe acute lung inflammation with local release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, accumulation of inflammatory cells and increased pulmonary permeability that was more pronounced than following endotoxin (3). The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the influence of flagellin on lung fluid filtration in rats.",

INTRODUCTION. Protein C is activated by thrombin bound to thrombomodulin and this effect is enhanced in the presence of the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that components of this pathway may also inhibit inflammatory responses. Protein C was able to inhibit leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells and to reduce neutrophil accumulation in rat lungs [1] . Protein C inhibits proinflammatory cytokine release in monocytes [2] that were shown to express EPCR [3] . Soluble EPCR binds to proteinase-3 and CD11b/CD18 of activated neutrophils [4] , which were previously shown to synthesize thrombomodulin but not to promote thrombin-dependent protein C activation [5] . If protein C directly affects neutrophil functions has not jet been sufficiently demonstrated. We investigated the in vitro effects of protein C and activated protein C on chemotaxis of isolated human neutrophils and explored wether EPCR may be involved.",

INTRODUCTION. : Ischemia/reperfusion or sepsis is initially responsible of an acute activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF-)). It is followed by a rise of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. Interleukin-10 (IL-10)). In Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) TNF-induces a mitochondrial release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dosedependent manner.

The aim was therefore to investigate regional net fluxes of the fibrinolytic enzyme tissue-type plasminogen activator, tPA, and its main inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1, PAI-1, in response to endotoxemia. METHODS. Anesthetized pigs (n=8) were instrumented for registration of cardiac output (CO, thermodilution) and portal (QPV), hepatic (QHA) and renal (QRA) blood flows (ultrasound flowmetry, Transonic). Blood samples were collected from the aorta and pulmonary artery as well as the portal, hepatic and renal veins. After baseline registrations, all animals were subjected to an E. coli endotoxin infusion for 90 min, followed by a volume/norepinephrine resuscitation for 210 min targeting baseline CO levels. Plasma concentrations of both total and active tPA and PAI-1 were determined as described [1, 2] and net organ fluxes (ng/min) were calculated based on in-/outflowing plasma concentrations and local plasma flow [1]. RESULTS. Endotoxemia induced a low CO state and a decrease in QPV. Total liver blood flow was preserved due to a concomitant increase in QHA. During resuscitation CO and QPV were restored to baseline values. Systemic plasma levels of total tPA increased over time during endotoxemia, peaking at 90 min, whereupon a decline occurred. However, plasma levels of total tPA had not returned to baseline values at the end of the registration period (300 min). Changes in systemic levels of active tPA mirrored changes in total tPA. A marked (8-fold) increase in mesenteric net release of total tPA was observed. This response was paralleled by a pronounced increase in hepatic uptake of tPA. PAI-1 described a different response to endotoxemia. By the end of the experiment plasma levels of both active and total PAI-1 increased. In contrast, no significant net fluxes of PAI-1 were observed across any of the investigated vascular beds except for the hepatic vascular bed, where a net release of both total and active PAI-1 occurred at approximately 150 min. Hepatic PAI-1 release rates then increased progressively. CONCLUSION. Endotoxemia induced a marked increase in mesenteric release of tPA which however was not entirely responsible for the increase in systemic plasma level of tPA. The results indicate that this profribrinolytic response at later stages are counteracted by increased plasma levels of PAI-1 and this increase is mainly derived from the hepatic vascular bed. Thus, patients with altered regional endothelial functions or liver capacity prior to a septic challenge can be expected to demonstrate varying susceptibility to thrombotic events. ",

After a resting period segments of 8 cm length were set up in parallel organ bathes containing oxygenated Tyrode's solution. Peristaltic contractions were elicited by perfusion of the segments with Tyrode's solution at a rate of 0.5 ml/min, against an aboral resistance of 400 Pascal. The intraluminal pressure increased gradually until it reached a pressure threshold (PT) which triggered peristaltic contractions. These contractions were recorded via a pressure transducer at the aboral end of the segments.

Administration of reconstituted HDL reduces cytokine release and attenuates shock in experimental endotoxaemia (1). The HDL associated enzymes paraoxonase (PON) and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT), destroy oxidised lipids that induce inflammatory changes in vascular endothelium (2). Incorporation of Serum Amyloid A (SAA), an acute phase protein, into the HDL particle during the inflammatory response, may displace these protective enzymes producing a particle with proinflammatory properties (3). Alterations in HDL composition may, therefore, be implicated in dysregulation of the inflammatory response and could influence outcome from septic shock. METHODS. Patients with septic shock, not given TPN or propofol, were recruited. APACHE II scores and ICU mortality were recorded. Plasma and serum samples were taken within 48 hours of the onset of shock. HDL cholesterol was measured by microenzymatic colorimetric assay. Apolipoprotein AI (APO AI) was quantified by liquid phase radioimmunoassay. PON activity was determined by measuring the rate of paraoxon hydrolysis and described as percent of a control serum pool. LCAT activity was quantified by measuring the esterification rate of 14 C labelled cholesterol. SAA was measured by ELISA. Results were compared with those of a pool of healthy volunteers and between survivors and nonsurvivors. (Mann Whitney U test). RESULTS. 20 patients were recruited.

LPS concentrations in the gastro-intestinal tracts of these patients are elevated as a consequence of bacterial overgrowth. LPS processing in the mesenteric circulation may influence the systemic inflammatory response (2). TLR4 is an integral part of the LPS receptor complex. A TLR4 polymorphism (Asp299Gly) is associated with hypo-responsiveness to LPS in human bronchial epithelial cells. We examined the association of this polymorphism with clinical outcome in ICU patients with severe SIRS. METHODS. Adult ICU patients with evidence of severe SIRS were studied. Patient demographics, APACHE II data, length of stay and outcome data were collected. Genotype was determined using PCR amplification. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.0. RESULTS. 67 patients have been genotyped of whom 2 are still in ICU. Of the remaining patients, 20/65 (31%) died in ICU and 9 died in hospital after discharge from ICU, giving an overall hospital mortality rate of 29/65 (45%). Mean (SD) APACHE II score was 21 (5).The TLR4 genotype frequencies were Asp/Asp 88.1% (59/67), Asp/Gly 10.4% (7/67) and Gly/Gly 1.5% (1/67). The allele frequencies were Asp 93% and Gly 7%, similar to previously reported frequencies in Caucasians. Preliminary analysis revealed no significant differences between APACHE II scores in patients with the Asp/Asp genotype (mean 20.7, SD 5.6) and those with Asp/Gly or Gly/Gly genotypes (mean 19.0, SD 2.8) (p=0.40, Student's t-test). 5/29 (17%) of patients who died during the hospital episode carried the Gly polymorphism, compared to 3/36 (5%) of those who survived the hospital episode (p=0.45, Fisher's exact test, OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.5-10.5). CONCLUSION. No associations with severity of illness on admission to ICU, ICU length of stay or hospital outcome were detected with the present sample size. Recruitment is ongoing, to attain sufficient power. We aim to study genes coding for components of the LPS receptor complex, which are biologically relevant to innate immunity and the development of SIRS. Detailed, prospective study of the role of polymorphisms in innate immunity has the potential to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of SIRS, and to influence risk stratification and management of this severe complication of life-threatening infection.

First 24 hours of PO: dobutamine or norepinephrine (NOR) use, blood drainage volume, lowest blood lactate measurement and prognostic scores SOFA, TISS and MODS. For dichotomyc variables, Mann-Whitney Test was applied; for continuous variables we used Kendall's Tau Non-Parametric Correlation Test; Cuzick Tendency Test was used to evaluate association with LVD. RESULTS. Median MV duration: 8 hours; mean duration time 37.8 hours (1 to 742). Increased MV duration was associated with emergency surgery (p=0.0117), coronary artery bypass graft surgery (p=0.0307), need of IAB counterpulsation after ECC (p=0.0005), use of NOR (p<0.0001). Increases in MV duration were associated with increasing values of some variables (Positive Correlation): age (p<0.0001), surgery duration (p=0.0058), blood input/output difference (p<0.0001) and SOFA, TISS and MODS scores (p<0.0001). Negative Correlation was presented for fluids input/output difference (p=0.0142) and P/F (p<0.0001). Increased linear tendency for MV duration correlates with worsening of LVD (p=0.012). CONCLUSION. More sophisticated statistical analysis should be applied in order to determine the cause-effect correlation for these variables. Interventional studies will be conducted in the following months. ",

            "text": "Cerebral vasospasm is a, potentially, life threatening phenomenon after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). As part of \"triple H\" therapy, fenylephrine and norepinephrine in combination with dobutamine and dopamine, are used most frequently to elevate systemic arterial blood pressure (ABP) in order to preserve optimal cerebral blood flow. In obtaining increased arterial blood pressure during episodes of vasospasm we altered medical therapy from fenylephrine to norepinephrine but experienced an increasing incidence of paralytic ileus. In a retrospective cohort study we evaluated clinical outcome and the incidence of paralytic ileus. METHODS. In 1991-1999, a consecutive series of 146 patients had surgery (aneurysmal clip ligation) within 72 hours after SAH. 80 patients with clinical vasospasm, were subdivided into two groups with respect to medication used. Group A (N=48) was treated with a combination of dobutamine, dopamine and fenylephrine (mean increase syst. ABP 40.0\u00b120.5 mm Hg). In group B (N=32) norepinephrine was used instead of fenylephrine (mean increase in syst. ABP 57.8 \u00b1 27.3 mm Hg). We compared basic variables of the two treatment groups, and investigated the clinical outcome using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), one year after initial SAH. Complications were registered and compared between these treatment groups. RESULTS. The two treatment groups were evenly matched concerning age (p=0.28), WFNSscore at admission (p=0.89), amount of subarachnoid blood on CT-scan (Fisher) (p=0.75), and observed prognostic variables as hypertension (p=0.50) and smoking (p=0.65). The clinical outcome, was not influenced by the kind of medication used (p=0.55). The incidence of paralytic ileus differed between the two groups (group A: 2/48 vs group B: 12/32, p<0,001). Paralytic ileus occurred mainly in patients treated with norepinephrine (12/32=37.5%, Odds Ratio=13.8). No relationship was found in height of systolic ABP or dosage of norepinephrine administered to these patients. We observed a significant difference in duration of administration of norepinephrine in patients, who did develop a paralytic ileus (see -12.14 / -3.42 p=0.002 Table: norepinephrine use in cerebral vasospasm; patients with or without paralyticileus. CONCLUSION. -The use of norepinephrine in patients with cerebral vasospasm after SAH did not influence clinical outcome, although higher blood pressure levels were reached. -Norepinephrine administered during longer periods than 12 days, increases the risk of paralytic ileus.-Fenylephrine is recommended in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after SAH.",

Paradoxically, prognosis is slightly better than in patients with isolated refractory congestive heart failure. Organic renal failure could artificially worsens cardiac function by increasing diuretic resistance which may be improved by SDUF. (1). This study aims to evaluate the influence of factors affecting renal blood flow including MAP, CVP, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) on immediate graft function. METHODS. 15 consecutive patients undergoing live-related kidney transplant were included. Prior to anaesthesia, a 7.5F continuous cardiac output pulmonary artery catheter was placed via the right internal jugular vein. A continuous cardiac output monitor (Baxter Edwards PX 1800) was used for haemodynamic monitoring. Baseline values of the MAP, CVP, PAWP, CI, SVR and PVR were computed. Data was collected at 30-minute intervals thereafter and immediately before and after release of the vascular clamps. The ischemia time, intravenous fluids, dopamine use and blood transfusion were noted. If warranted by low preoperative haemoglobin or increased surgical blood loss, blood was administered as 200 ml packed cell units using leukocyte filters. The outcomes chosen for graft function were the urine output on table (UO-OT), 24-hour urine output (UO-24), fall of serum creatinine from the preoperative value on day 1 (Creat-1) and day 7 (Creat-7). Using SPSS statistical software, multiple linear regression analysis was done to find the variables significantly affecting the outcome. RESULTS. The only variable found to have a statistically significant influence on UO-OT was the MAP. No variable had any effect on the UO-24.

Postoperative transfusion needs were 8.4 ml/kg (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1-12.8) for AP fusion, 6.8 ml/kg (95% CI 4.8-8.7)for P fusion; A fusion and IW doesn't need postoperative blood replacement. Total blood transfusion was 40.7 ml/kg (95% CI 29.7-51.8)for AP fusion, 23.2 ml/kg (95% CI19.3-27.1)for P fusion; 6.9ml/kg for A fusion and 7.6 ml/kg for IW.Volume demands(no blood products)during first postoperative day were 81.4 ml/kg (95% CI 50.5-112.2)for AP fusion, 59.1 ml/kg (95% CI 48-69.7) for P fusion;38ml/kg for A fusion and 44.8 ml/kg for IW. CONCLUSION. Spine surgery has few major complications rate in a reference spine surgery pediatric hospital. Minor respiratory complications affect 15% of our patients without repercussion in outcome. Total blood loss is greater in AP fusion than in other procedures, but postoperative blood replacement in PICU didn't differ between procedures. ",

All the patients were treated by a flowtriggered intensive care mechanical ventilator (Siemens Servo 300 ventilator, Siemens-Elema, Sweden) through a tight fitting face mask. NPPV was administered for at least 24 hours postadmission. A pressure-control mode was adopted for better compensation of leaks around the mask. Flow-sensitive trigger permitted a better synchronization of patient's spontaneous breathing, limiting the need for deeper patient sedation (low-dose midazolam drip). Initially, a relatively low ventilator frequency delivery was set (8-10 b/min). Peak inspiratory pressure was tritrated upward to obtain an exhaled tidal volume of 5-6 ml/kg maintaining a PaCO2 value <65 mmHg and a pH >7.25; PEEP value was adjusted to maintain an oxygen saturation >91-92% with a required FiO2 <0.6. RESULTS. All patients were referred to PICU on spontaneous breathing: those admitted with ET tube already positioned were not considered eligible for this study. An oxygenation improvement was obtained in all patients within 3 hours from the onset of NPPV . The PaO2/FiO2 increased from 86.29 \u00b116.13 to 235.6\u00b132.32 (p<0.05) and 292.6 \u00b1 25.75 (p<0.001) on selected time points (3 and 12 hours after NPPV introduction, respectively); conformly, alveolar-to-arterial oxygenation difference (A-aDO2) decreased from a 462.3 \u00b1 77.77 to 195.7 \u00b1 59.67 (p<0.05) and 101.8 \u00b1 23.92 (p<0.001) respectively. CONCLUSION. NPPV resulted a safe and effective therapeutic approach in both hypoxemic and hypercapneic ARF episodes in this children group affected by NMD. Even in cases of emergency presentation or when resuscitation is needed, it is of importance to identify NMD children with residual ventilator-free breathing ability thus performing a NPPV trial. Life-threatening respiratory distress and young age should not preclude NPPV application in a PICU setting. ",

The technique relies on the presence of adequate peripheral arterial pulsations, which are detected as photoplethysmographic signals (PPG). When peripheral perfusion is poor as in states of hypovolaemia, hypothermia and vasoconstriction oxygenation readings become extremely unreliable. Hence, pulse oximetry becomes unreliable in a significant group of children just at the time when accurate readings are most needed. To overcome this limitation, the oesophagus has been investigated as a potential measurement site on the hypothesis that perfusion may well be better preserved at this central site. Studies on adult patients have shown that measurable PPG signals at red and infrared wavelengths can be detected within the whole depth of the oesophagus. A new system to investigate the quality of oesophageal PPG signals is being constructed with the aim of developing a neonatal and paediatric oesophageal pulse oximeter.",

Patient 1 (E.G, swiss, 1,75 y) suffered from an acute myelogenous leukemia (M 7 with t(1;22) of early infancy After complete first remission by conventional chemotherapy an allogeneic stem cell transplantation with a matched unrelated donor was performed. Conditioning comprised busulfan, VP16 and cyclophosphamide. Patient 2 (M.K, iranian, 11 y) suffered from beta-thalassemia major with secondary moderate hemosiderosis, as well as chronic persisting hepatitis C infection with liver fibrosis. He received a matched related bone marrow transplantation, using i.v. busulfan , reduced cyclophosphamide dose and fludarabine. Both patients received low dose heparin (100 IU/kg) and antithrombin III substitution. In addition, pat. 2 got prophylactical defibrotide (20 mg/kg) and N-acetylcystein. Two weeks after transplant both patients developed VOD (severe (pat 1); moderate to severe (pat 2))with weight gain, hepatomegaly, massive ascites and severe thrombocytopenia. Maximal bilirubin was 15 mg/dl (pat 1) and 2 mg/dl)(pat 2). Therapy with defibrotide (60 mg/kg) was started immediately. In pat.1 the pulmonary situation deteriorated rapidly with massive aszites and oxygen need and a reversed portal venous flow. Defibrotide was stopped after 5 days. Thrombolytic therapy using rTPA and a continuous PC substitution (PC level 16%; bolus 100 IU/kg, followed by 100 IU/kg every 4h)) were started. Lysis therapy had to be abandoned due to respiratory tract bleeding Global coagulation (PT 34 %, aPTT 250 sec) and PC level normalized within hours after PC substitution. A normal centripetal portal flow could be achieved by high dose defibrotide (120 mg/kg) and continued PC substitution after several weeks. Pat. 2 showed only a temporary improvement under defibrotide treatment. Due to clinical deterioration (hepatic pain, increased ascites) and low PC level (38%) a continuous PC substitution (50 IU/kg every 6 h) was initiated. There was a prompt recovery after adding PC with a dramatic reduction of ascites, weight and abdominal pain within 2-3 days after start of PC infusion. Elevated bilirubin levels returned to normal in both patients.",

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of local transfusion guidelines emphasizing restrictive strategy on patients undergoing heart surgery and the prognostic value of transfusion following those restrictive criteria. METHODS. Two groups of 100 heart surgery patients were compared before and after the introduction of local transfusion guidelines. These guidelines involved general information on blood transfusion risks and obligation for the physician to respect predetermined transfusion criteria (Hb <7g/dl or >7 g/dl associated to systolic arterial pressure <90 mmHg or age over 70yrs or HR >100/min or CI <2.2 l/mim/m\u00b2 or other associated disease 5.5 5.2 6 6.4* 5.6 5.6 8.5 9.9* <0.05 Mortality (%) 4 6* 6 19* <0.05 CONCLUSION. Introduction of local restrictive transfusion guidelines was associated to a significant reduction in red cell transfusion during the postoperative period of heart surgery. The global morbidity and mortality rates in the whole group of patients were not affected. However patients who required blood transfusion following the restrictive strategy had a worse outcome. Transfusion was probably more the consequence than the cause of this worse prognosis. If transfusion was the cause of the worse prognosis, then morbidity and mortality rates would have been higher among patients requiring transfusion during liberal period than in the whole group of patient.",

Immunoparalysis, including monocyte deactivation assessed by decrease in HLA-DR expression, has been repeatedly described during the first stage of human septic shock (SS) (1). In order to evaluate the specificity of monocyte deactivation in SS, we compared HLA-DR expression between severe shock from various origin [SS, cardiogenic shock (CS), hemorrhagic shock (HS)] and sepsis (S) and healthy volunteers (V). Severity of shock was analysed by lactate level values and catecholamine use.METHODS.After approval of the hospital's ethics committee, 82 patients were enrolled in a bicentric study. Monocyte HLA-DR surface expressed as % of CD14+ monocytes expressing HLA-DR, was determined at day 1 (D1), D3 and D7 by flow cytometric analysis. Data are presented as mean SEM, statistics were performed by Anova test followed by Fisher test.RESULTS.As previously reported, HLA-DR expression is severely decreased at D1 and D3 in SS. Despite the presence of lactic acidosis and similar use of catecholamines in CS and HS, HLA-DR expression remained normal in those 2 groups. However, in 5 patients admitted for CS, HLA-DR eventually decreased when septic shock occurred in those patients.CONCLUSION.Our data confirms the transient monocyte deactivation in SS and show that monocyte deactivation is a specific marker of SS since no alteration in HLA-DR expression was observed in CS and HS.",

E. 1 , Gueguenia C. 2 , Diby M. 2 , Romand J. A. 2 , Walder B. 2 1 Medical Intensive Care Unit, Surgical Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Geneva, Geneva, SwitzerlandINTRODUCTION.Sleep is an important parameter of quality of life. The aim was to assess the impact of cardiac surgical insult and ICU environmental factors on sleep observed over one month. METHODS. Prospective cohort study in a tertiary teaching hospital. Exclusion criteria: major comorbidities, dementia, chronic pain, insomnia, chronic intake of hypnotics, antiepileptics or antidepressants. A validated French translation of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (1) was applied before surgery, at the end of ICU stay, and one month after surgery. For parametric data, unpaired t-test and one way ANOVA, for nonparametric data, Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used. RESULTS. Eighty French speaking patients of 62 \u00b113 years (mean \u00b1 S.D.), male:female 79%:21%, were included consecutively. 44% had coronary artery bypass grafting, 13% aortic valve replacement, 6% mitral valve replacement, 29% combined, 9% other cardiac surgery. Compared with before surgery, patients presented significantly more cough, nycturia and pain disturbing their sleep after one month. Compared with before surgery and after 1 month, patients presented significantly more pain and bad dreams at the end of ICU stay. Eleven of 55 patients (20%) reported a new regular intake of hypnotics after one month. Four of 55 patients (7%) who did use hypnotics before surgery stopped doing so one month after. 63 patients presenting complete insomnia, temporal disorientation, amnesia or delirium were temporarily excluded ; * significantly different from end of ICU stay and after 1 month ; \u00b0 significantly different from before surgery and after 1 month.CONCLUSION.Cardiac surgery and ICU stay are followed by an impairment of quality of life due to sleep disturbances for at least 1 month.They lead to a new postoperative intake of hypnotics in 20% of the patients. Disturbances, i.e. more frequent sleep interruption, are mainly related to more nycturia, coughing and pain compared with the preoperative status. REFERENCES. 1.

Acute pain after surgery may contribute to chronic pain and may worsen quality of life after a successful intervention. The aim was to assess pain intensity after cardiac surgery during intensive care (ICU) stay, and during convalescence.METHODS.Prospective cohort study in a tertiary teaching hospital. Pain evaluation and treatment of the health care provider was not standardized; pain intensity was evaluated daily by an independent observer during ICU using visual analog scale (VAS). An adapted, validated questionnaire of the American Pain Society on pain during ICU was applied at ICU discharge, and on pain during convalescence at one month after surgery. For proportions, Fisher's Exact tests, for nonparametric data, Mann-Whitney tests, for correlations, Spearman Rank Tests were used.RESULTS.Eighty patients following cardiac surgery of 62 13 years (mean S.D.), male:female 79%: 21% were included consecutively. Median VAS at rest during ICU was 24 mm, median VAS at mobilisation 50 mm.Table 1. VAS at rest and at mobilisation measured on day 2 correlated with NRS at rest during convalescence(r=0.36, p=0.008; r=0.38, p=0.005). VAS at mobilisation (cut-off 60 mm) on day 2 predicted NRS at rest (cut-off 3) during convalescence [0.CONCLUSION. High pain intensity levels are reported by the patients during ICU after discharge. Pain after on month is reduced compared with ICU discharge. However, one third suffer from moderate to severe pain at rest, two thirds at mobilisation during convalescence. There is a correlation between pain during ICU and pain during convalescence.

T-student, Mann-Whitney, Chi-squared and Fisher Tests were used in the statistical analysis. CONCLUSION. there is a rather singular distribution of surgeries in this group. Many of the previously described variables showed correlation with mortality or longer admission in the ICU. Prospective studies will be held in order to adjust these variables and determine new ones more relevant to underdeveloped countries.",

One of the major morbidity's in use of CVC is catheter-related infection (CRI). The incidence of bacteremia with CVC use is approximately 5.3/1000 catheter days and mortality as high as 25%. One approach to reduce the incidence of CRI has been to decrease catheter bacterial colonization (CBC). Reduction in CBC is achieved by coating or impregnating antimicrobial substances into the catheter material. Use of minocycline/rifampin treated catheters has been shown to reduce the rate of CRI in critically ill patients. The concern in pediatric population is the use of minocycline. Tetracycline and its derivatives (minocycline), when used in young children, carry the risk of dental and sceletal abnormalities. The problem of potential eluting of minocycline from minocycline-impregnated catheters may pose a risk for young children. Our study examined whether detectable levels of minocycline and rifampin were present in the serum of the pediatric intensive care unit patients with indwelling minocycline/rifampin impregnated CVC. METHODS. Patients admitted to PCCU age 8-18 years and in need of CVC were eligible for study. Six patients were enrolled. Each patient had two samples of blood 2 and 2.5 ml withdrawn for rifampin and minocycline assays respectively. Collection times were at the time of catheter insertion and 24h thereafter for seven days or until catheter removal, whichever came first. Rifampin serum samples were processed prospectively soon after colection by standard HPLC. Minocycline serum samples were stored frozen in -80 centigrade and assayed in one batch using reverse phase HPLC. RESULTS. Demographic data are in table. Ranges with mean values in ( ). None of the minocycline samples had detectable level of antibiotic. The limit of sensitivity for minocycline was 0.4 mg/l. Therapeutic levels are 1.4-1.8 mcg/ml. One patient had 4 consecutive samples 3 to 6 with low therapeutic levels of rifampin (4-5 mcg/ml). Therapeutic levels of rifampin are 4-32 mcg/ml. Rifampin sensitivity was 1 mcg/ml. Rifampin has distinct peak time and no interfering substances were identified.Sex (3), the emergence of this consequences required fast and corrective treatment.

More frequent procedures were : 54 lumbar punctures (LP), 23 thoracentesis or drainages, 21 central catheters insertion, endoscopys 18. We identified 3 different groups in relation to methods of sedation/analgesy : 1-Procedures done in the emergency department with local anesthesia; 2-procedures done with administration of intravenous midazolan+ketamine; 3-procedures done with anesthesic support. We used the Ramsay scale to classify the degree of anesthesia and the Serna behavioral scale to classify the reaction to the procedure.RESULTS. Group1(n=36):42%patients fighted against the procedure (serna scale 1) and in 25% of the patients, complications of the procedure were found to be related to inadequate sedation. Group2 (n=67): in 10%, sedation was considered inadequate -serna level 1 (n=1) and 2 (n=5)-and in 1 case there were complications of the procedure related to unsufficient sedation; there were 7 (10%)cases of minor complications sedation-related; Group3(n=51): patient confort and adequacy of the sedation were found in 100%, with 2 (4%) complications of the anesthesic method.CONCLUSION.

During the study period all adult patients who had been intubated and mechanically ventilated for at least 48 hours were included (patients who died before 48 hours are excluded). Three to six months after their critical illness, survival data were retrieved from hospital and national registers. All patients surviving at this time were sent a health survey questionnaire (SF-36) and the Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome 10-Questions Inventory (PTSS-10). RESULTS. 153 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 69 years, 40% were women. Health questionnaires were returned by 36 (58 %) of the 62 survivors at follow-up time. 28-day survival rate was 58 %, at 100 days survival rate had fallen to 46%. Among the 36 responding survivors the frequency of a response pattern compatible with PTSD was 28%. Survivors without signs of PTSD had SF-36 mean scores more than 1 standard deviation (SD) below the Swedish norm in the domains of Physical Functioning, Role-Physical and Social Functioning. Survivors with signs of PTSD scored below non-PTSD survivors in every domain, and were more than 3 SD below the Swedish norm in the domains of Social Functioning, Roleemotional and Mental Health. In total, there were only five persons (14 % of respondents) who scored at or above the Swedish norm for both the Physical and the Mental Health Summary Scales. Assuming the same outcome in non-respondents this figure would correspond to about 6% of all the 153 included patients. CONCLUSION. In this cohort of severely ill patients 28-day mortality was in the expected range but much mortality (another 12 %) occurs in the following 10 weeks, indicating a number of patients who have been subjected to long-lasting care with very meagre benefits. At 3-6 months following onset of their disease, survivors show considerably reduced subjective rating of their general health and life quality. As much as 28 % of the survivors show signs compatible with PTSD. It could be estimated that about 6 % of all patients included will both survive and within 3 -6 months reach a level of general health comparable to that of the general population. ",

RESULTS. Of 1451 patients in our ICU during two years, we include those 613 (42.2%) who stayed for more than 72 hours. According to results from cultures we divided them to three groups. Group one included 355 (57.9%) patients without bacterial growth. Group 2 included patients with proved nosocomial infections /NCI/. We obtained samples: 898 from urinary catheters (376 positive-41.9%), 552 from tracheal tube (457 positive-82.8%), 597 from blood (282 positive-47.2%), 64 intradermal segments from central venous lines (34 positive-53.1%), and 17 from sputum (15 positive-88.2%). The most common place for emergence of NCI in our ICU is respiratory tract. On 5-th ICU day the tract became infected in almost 56% of the patients. The major role among pathogens played Acinetobacter spp. (27.4%), Citrobacter spp. (20.3%), P.aeruginosa (12% and Serratia spp. (10%). The second place for emergence of NCI is \"reserved\" for blood-stream infections. Almost the half of the cultures (47.2%) showed bacterial growth. The isolated pathogens were the same: Acinetobacter spp (19%), Serratia spp. (16%), but there was substantial rise in frequency of emergence of S. epidermidis during the last years (see figure) . Its frequency almost equalized that of Acinetobacter spp. The other two main sources for NCI were urine catheters and CV catheters. They remained on 3-rd and 4-th place. Group 3 included patients with endogenous surgical wound infections. In this group we obtained samples from surgical wounds and drainages. In 1999 25.6% of cultures showed bacterial growth. During next 2000 this figure rose nearly twice (48.3%). The leading role played the same Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and E. coli.

SAP cases are identified in accordance with generally accepted criteria in each ICU, such as Ranson, Imrie, PCR and CT-dynamic criteria. SAP was selected from the data base of the National Study of Spanish Nosocomial Infection Monitoring (ENVIN). This study covered the period from 1997 to 2000. ENVIN is an observational, prospective and multicentre study. SAP patients hospitalized during more than 24 hours in all the participating ICU's have been included in the study. These patients were monitored until their discharge from the ICU or up to a maximum of 30-60 days. Secondary infections have also been monitored. Severity is measured by means of APACHE II. Infections, mortality, epidemiological data and antibiotics used as a means of prevention are described. The statistical analysis used the Chi X2 Test for the association of qualitative variables, the Student t for the comparison of averages and the 5% statistical significance level RESULTS. 199 patients (1.18%) of the 16,927 patients monitored by ENVIN were found to have SAP. The average APACHE II was 14.9 and the average stay was 12.2 days. The base illness was medical (94.5%) and surgical (5%). 30.7% of the patients underwent emergency surgery. NI accumulated incidence was 48.7% and density incidence was 40/1000 hospitalization days. Crude mortality was 31% and NI-related mortality was 45%. 97 infections were detected: 27 of abdominal origin (27.8%), 17 ventilator-associated pneumonias (18.5%), 12 secondary bacteremias related to abdominal infection (12.4%), 12 catheter-associated urinary tract infections 12.4%; primary bacteremias (10.3%); 3 central venous catheter-associated bacteremia (1.5%). A total of 66 pathogens were isolated. BGN 58.5%, CGP 24.5% (MRSA 4.2%), Fungii 17% (principally Candidas), Enterococci 15% and anaerobes 3.7%. 85.4% of the SAP patients received antibiotic treatment. The antibiotic most frequently used in prophylaxis was Imipenem-cilastatine (70%) and Piperaciline-tazobactam (10%). The antibiotics most frequently used in absolute indication were Imipenem 70%, Piperaciline/tazobactam 19.4%, Metronidazol 14%, Vancomicina 13.5%, Ciprofloxacino13%, Amikacina in 13% and Fluconazol 7.6% CONCLUSION. SAP cases in Spanish ICU's account for little more than 1% of all hospital cases, but they result in high levels of severity, morbidity and mortality. Crude mortality and SAP septic complication-related mortality in Spanish ICU's are much higher than the average indicated in the literature (29.7% and 14.9%). Imipenem is the antibiotic most frequently used in prophlaxis. The irruption of Candidas has been detected. ",
