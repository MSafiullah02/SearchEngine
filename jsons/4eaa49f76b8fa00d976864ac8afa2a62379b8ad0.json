Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths immediately indicate that countries like Italy and Spain have the worst situation as of mid April 2020, on its own, reported cases do not provide a correct picture of the situation. The reason is that different countries diagnose diversely and present very distinctive reported case fatality rate (CFR). The same levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying picture. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain an uniform unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empiric. The key assumption of the method is that the real CFR in Europe of COVID-19 is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol has a dynamic nature, and it has been giving converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as of mid April 2020. From this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain an Effective Potential Growth (EPG) updated everyday providing an unbiased assessment of the countries with more potential to have an uncontrolled situation. The method developed will be used to track possible improvements on the diagnostic rate in European countries as the epidemic evolves.",

            "text": "The evolution of the epidemic in Europe has affected Spain and Italy more strongly 2 than in other countries so far. This is clear from reported cases and fatalities in these 3 However, they lack the recipe-type nature needed sometimes to direct a policy response. 22 The focus of this paper is, thus, to introduce a method to compute the real 23 diagnostic rate and the real incidence of COVID-19 in each European country, testing 24 that the key hypothesis of the method is fulfilled and that, if they were to be slightly 25 off, they would affect all countries in the same direction. In other words, we provide a 26 recipe for policymakers that we have tested to be correct, unbiased across countries and 27 useful to make cross-country comparison provided the evolution and prognosis of the 28 disease in a patient is not strongly dependent on socio-economic factors and only on age, 29 sex and previous clinical history. 30 We must recall here that the ability to determine the diagnostic ratio is essential to 31 evaluate what the real number of infected people is. Knowledge of this number is not 32 only useful to visualize the full scope of the epidemic but also to properly estimate the 33 number of people with probable short-term immunity. In this sense, our method can be 34 added as an empirical take of other assessments about the real incidence of the disease 35 and to study the possibility of developing herd immunity. A large number of real 36 infected people would be a positive scenario for policymakers while a low number will be 37 negative. It is thus very important to err on the side of caution in all our estimates 38 giving always the less optimistic take. 39 The basic structure of the paper is the following. First, we give a general overview of 40 our framework in the methods section. Then we discuss our key assumption: the real 41 case fatality rate (CFR) in European countries experiencing a significative incidence will 42 be roughly the same, given the similar structure of the population. If the real CFR were 43 to be lower, or higher, it would affect all countries in the same way and would not affect 44 most policy decision-making since it will move all countries in the same direction. We 45 take this real CFR to be 1% and proceed to test that, effectively, there is a strong 46 correlation between the day of reported deaths with the number of cases taken 7-10 47 days before. Once a given value for the real CFR is taken, one must consider that 48 people do not die immediately from the disease, as it takes roughly 18 days after 49 infection [10] [11] [12] . In other words, the present values of the death toll can provide an 50 estimation of the number of infected people 18 days ago. Knowing the number of 51 infected people at present, not 18 days in the past, is crucial. We attack this problem 52 considering that people who become infected are usually diagnosed a few days after the 53 onset of the symptoms, which can be 8 to 14 days after infection occurs. By comparing 54 the number of people diagnosed on a certain date with our estimation of the real number of infected people, we can estimate what percentage of the cases are being 56 diagnosed. We can calculate this for different countries and regions and test how this 57 ratio has changed dynamically as the epidemic advanced. 58 In the results section, we provide a full detailed description of how this fraction has 59 become steady in the last weeks. We demonstrate that the percentage of diagnosis 60 throughout the development of the epidemic has taken values that gradually converge 61 for most countries. This gives a final clear picture showing the rate of diagnosis for each 62 country. Using this rate is straightforward to give a present-day estimate of the 63 incidence given the number of reported infected people in each country as long as we 64 can observe that the rate of diagnosis remains fairly constant. For policymakers, we 65 have constructed an index named Effective Potential Growth (EPG) that combines this 66 information with the growth rate of the epidemic to provide insight regarding which 67 countries are, comparatively and in the short-term, in the most potentially complicated 68 situation [9] . 69 ",

Our two core assumptions are that the real 75 CFR in all European countries is roughly the same and that reported data of death due 76 COVID-19 is uniform in all European countries under consideration. We will address 77 these two hypothesis in the following sections. With these assumptions we need to carry 78 out four steps, as indicated in Fig. 1 , to obtain the percentage of diagnosis. First, using 79 a common reference CFR = 1% and, given the reported reported death count, we 80 estimate the number of cases 18 days ago. According to medical reports people die 81 between 15 and 22 days after the development of the first symptoms [13] . This time to 82 death, TtD, after the development of the first symptoms will not be country-specific for 83 demographic reasons. The estimated number of infected people with the disease at time 84 t (see process in Fig. 1 This allows us to know to estimate the number of cases 18 days ago. This value can 86 be compared with the number of cases detected 18 days ago, obtaining a diagnostic depending on the availability of tests, saturation of the health system and other 91 external factors, countries have a great variability in the time of diagnosis delay.",

Therefore we cannot assume 97 that the estimated and the reported are comparable and we need to know what the 98 diagnostic time was for each of the countries studied. 99 We can compare the reported deaths with the reported cases to find the maximal 100 correlation, see process 2 in Fig. 1(A) , to estimate the DD, see process 3 in Fig. 1(A) .",

An increase of 68% is observed. However, it is 212 interesting to compare this with the data reported for COVID-19 deaths. The reported 213 deaths by COVID-19 are roughly 20000, depending on how you attribute deaths to a 214 particular day in the calendar.

It seems reasonable to expect other countries to have underreported way below 218 or slightly below this level.

In Fig. 2C we can see the correlation [25] between reported cases and reported 230 deaths assuming different DtD for Germany, Spain and Switzerland. As you might 231 expect, correlations have values close to 1. In most cases the correlation has a concave 232 parabolic shape with a clearly defined maximum. We assume this maximum represents 233 DtD for each country. The correlation interval is estimated as the points where the 234 correlation is greater than 99% of the observed maximum.

The bias due to demography was 245 shown to be around 10-15%, precisely the same order of magnitude we obtain for the 246 possible bias in the counting of reported mortal cases. Given that our aim is to provide 247 a clear method for policymakers and that there is no data on how, or even if, both 248 correlate, a common CFR allows us to homogenize the results with the clear limitation 249 that we will obtain reasonable estimations and not exact results. The resulting picture 250 is expected to be closer to reality than using purely reported data, but worse than 251 correcting properly for age and diagnosis if the data of CFR for all age brackets and 252 locations (nursery homes, hospitals, individual homes) were available, which is not the 253 case. The estimation of the diagnostic rate is straightforward. From the cumulative 255 number of deceased each day, and multiplying by 100 (1% CFR) we get the cumulative 256 number of people with symptoms 18 days ago [10] [11] [12] simply by rescaling and displacing 257 backward in time the cumulated death curve of any country. To give an initial realistic 258 and homogenous diagnostic rate we must establish how many days are needed as a bare 259 minimum to be able to detect a patient from the onset of symptoms. First, the patient 260 has to feel sufficiently sick and then contact the Health Service. From this contact, the 261 doctor needs to be suspicious that the person has the disease and request a test. Then, 262 this test must be available, performed and the result received and annotated. It is clear 263 that a bare minimum of one week is needed for this process. We use the name 7-Days .

From this curve, we 270 can obtain the rate between the cumulated number of people who had symptoms for 7 271 or more days and the cumulated number of people detected 11 days ago. It is thus clear 272 that this homogenous analysis across countries could be performed assuming 5D-DR or 273 9D-DR and different CFR. It gives a proper first estimation of the situation. We argue, however, that there is indeed bias in the way people deal with the health 275 care system in normal situations and, especially, under an epidemic. Different countries 276 and populations are in fact behaving very differently. We have observed that this is the 277 case in the methods section checking the delay between diagnostic and death using 278 time-displaced correlation analysis. This is the reason why we also define the Delay to 279 Detection Diagnostic Rate (DD-DR) as the diagnostic rate computed using a time delay 280 between the appearance of symptoms and detectability different for each country. We 281 proceed to use Fig. 4 , with Spain as an example, to explain the concept behind DD-DR. 282 For Spain, the maximum correlation between cumulated death curves and cumulated 283 reported cases appears when cumulated deaths are displaced 4 days backward. This 284 suggests a DD of around two weeks (18 \u2212 4 = 14 days). This makes sense in a situation 285 like the one in Spain during March 2020. The population receiving news that the health 286 care system is under stress may decide to delay reporting of symptoms unless they are 287 very serious. Additionally, there is the possibility that tests are not available to people 288 who report with symptoms to primary health care centers, and that the delay between 289 the test, its positive result, and its record to official information systems is not 290 negligible as well.",

Even if the precise 333 number of people with the disease were known, and the distribution of symptoms by sex 334 and age was reported, there is no clear knowledge regarding the level of infectivity of 335 the different type of person and symptoms. For instance, it is not known the days a 336 person with mild symptoms can transmit the disease. The same can be said for people 337 with serious symptoms. Virus loads in the throat seem to be rather high across the 338 board [26] , but data on how this influence contagion is unclear. The only way to assess 339 the situation is to use a general unbiased broad measure, which is indicative of the 340 potential for infection. The ECDC uses the number of newly infected people in the last 341 14 days [27] . We use this same criterion. This number can only be obtained properly some days in the past, on the day we have a 346 typical diagnosis.

The complete 400 picture must be given by a more complex analysis of other data such as the number of 401 diagnoses per 100,000 inhabitants, distribution of these cases among regions and 402 according to age and sex, percentages of asymptomatic and mild cases, and spreading 403 rate of the epidemics, among others.
