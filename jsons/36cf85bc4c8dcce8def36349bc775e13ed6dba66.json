The carboxypeptidase ACE2 negatively regulates angiotensin II production by cleaving a single residue from both angiotensin I and II, thus interfering with the renin-angiotensin cascade. This cascade has recently been demonstrated to play a role in diffuse pulmonary alveolar injury mediated by the interaction of angiotensin II with angiotensin II receptor type 1. ACE2 has been demonstrated in vitro to be a cell-surface receptor for the surface spike protein of the SARS coronavirus. This suggests the possibility that the severe diffuse alveolar damage commonly seen in patients with SARS may be, at least in part, the consequence of the effects of angiotensin II. If so, the down-regulatory effects of ACE2 could play a protective role.",

These findings were reproduced by exposure to SARS coronavirus spike protein in the absence of replicative virus. In a murine model of acute lung injury due to acid aspiration, SARS coronavirus spike protein exacerbated lung failure by down-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system. SARS coronavirus Spike protein-induced lung failure could be mitigated by inhibition with angiotensin II receptor type 1, the receptor that mediates angiotensin II-induced vascular permeability and lung injury. In a separate publication, the same investigators demonstrated that recombinant ACE2 protects mice from acid aspiration-induced lung injury [1] . The investigators also note that ACE1 polymorphisms have been associated with progression of SARS [2] .",

The decreased availability of ACE2 impairs the ability to down-regulate the renin-angiotensin system, exacerbating lung injury. The authors suggest that recombinant ACE2 protein could be a potential therapeutic agent in this and related pulmonary infections and diffuse alveolar injuries. Trim5 is an intracellular retroviral restriction factor that effectively binds to incoming retroviral capsids and inhibits their replication at a stage prior to or concurrent with reverse transcription. Trim5a appears to account for the resistance of Old World monkeys to HIV-1 infection. Human Trim5a, in contrast, is unable to abort intracellular HIV-1 infection, despite having 87% homology at the amino acid level with its rhesus monkey counterpart.",

Finally, these results point to the potential therapeutic value of molecules that mimic Trim5a, as well as to the possibility of future targeted gene therapy. The golden pigment produced by S. aureus is compromised of a group of carotenoids. Carotenoids produced by fruits and vegetables are capable of scavenging free radicals and quenching singlet oxygen.
