Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus primarily causes equine infections. The agent may be found in the nasopharynx, on the tonsils, in the respiratory tract and on the genital mucous membranes of healthy horses and cattle. It is an important cause of respiratory tract infections in foals and young horses and it is involved in uterine infections in mares. The agent has also been associated with a wide variety of infections including mastitis in pigs, sheep, cows, goats and several other mammalian species [8] . These hosts can be a reservoir for human infections. The clinical manifestation includes pharyngitis, septicemia, meningitis, purulent arthritis and endocarditis. The source of human infection is often traced back to contact with domestic animals, especially horses, or ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products. Streptococci are colonizers of mucous membranes and are transmitted through droplets or direct contact.",

The clinical signs of the disease included severe purulent conjunctivitis, rhinitis, pharyngitis, respiratory distress and lethargy. Six of 45 animals died within a few days after developing signs of infection. Methods and results Histopathologic and microbiologic examinations of the dead animals were consistent with a severe fibrinopurulent bronchopneumonia. Microbiology revealed a Lancefield group C streptococcus identified as Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus as the causative agent of infection. Conclusions The infection was passed on from animal to animal but did not spread to the other five breeding groups nearby. Extensive diagnostic testing failed to reveal the consisting presence of copathogens in individual cases. A visitor with upper respiratory disease was suspected as source of infection.",

In the described monkey group the situation seems to be different. Bacteriologic investigation of tonsillar swabs indicates that there was no colonization or asymptomatic infection with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus among the group members which could have been activated by a stressor. The only exceptions were three animals (animal No. 7-9) that died in the consequence of heavy position fights. In these animals streptococci were found in the tonsils but they developed no clinical findings. The three animals belonged to the same family and had been in close contact to the dead animals. They developed a purulent tonsillitis and it is speculative if these animals may have established a latent infection comparable to horses if they survived the attacks.",

This observation should lead to a critical discussion of housing primates and other animal species in close vicinity of each other as is often the case in zoological gardens.
