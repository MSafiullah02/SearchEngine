The major characteristic of the WSSV infection is that the carapace and the body develop obvious white spots. In China, the outbreaks and prevalence of WSSV were greatly reduced with some control measures, such as eliminating infection source, cutting off the infection pathways of transmission, strengthening the control of water quality, and enhancement of diseases resistance in shrimp (He et al., 2000, He et al., 2003a). The production of cultured penaeid shrimp accounted for more than 600 thousand tons in 2004 in China. Up to now, the prevalence of WSSV remains and there is no effective antiviral treatment to control the outbreaks and prevalence of WSSV.",

            "text": "RNAi is a common mechanism for post-transcriptional gene silencing. It is a phenomenon recently observed in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. RNAi is initiated by the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific endonuclease or Dicer, which promotes cleavage of long dsRNA into 21\u201323-mer short interfering RNA (siRNA). Then siRNA molecules induce sequence-specific degradation of homologous single-stranded RNA (Elbashir et al., 2001, Sharp, 2001, Zamore, 2002). RNAi has been employed to manipulate gene expression, elucidate signal pathways, and knock down specific genes to evaluate their physiological roles or perhaps control pathogen infection (Fire et al., 1998, Kennerdell and Carthew, 1998, Ngo et al., 1998, Wianny and Zernicka-Goetz, 2000). In addition, RNAi has been widely proven as an effective mechanism to suppress the viral infection or replication of many viruses, including the several important human pathogens such as poliovirus (Gitlin et al., 2002), HIV-1 (Jacque et al., 2002), hepatitis B virus (McCaffrey et al., 2003, Shlomai and Shaul, 2003), hepatitis C virus (Kapadia et al., 2003), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) (Kahana et al., 2004), influenza virus A (Ge et al., 2003), Dengue virus (Adelman et al., 2002), and SARS coronavirus (SCV) (He et al., 2003b, Li et al., 2005). The results of these studies suggest the possibility of using RNAi as an antiviral tool in disease prevention in shrimp aquaculture.",

            "text": "Recently, a few groups have reported that viruses from the aquatic animals could be inhibited by exogenously synthetic long dsRNAs or siRNAs (Robalino et al., 2004, Robalino et al., 2005, Tirasophon et al., 2005, Westenberg et al., 2005, Xie et al., 2005). They showed that long dsRNA molecules could induce a sequence-independent antiviral immunity in shrimp (Robalino et al., 2004, Robalino et al., 2005), and viral replication could be effectively inhibited by long dsRNA molecules and siRNA molecules in shrimp or fish cells (Tirasophon et al., 2005, Xie et al., 2005). siRNA cannot act on non-specific sequence. However, it has been shown that non-specific siRNAs also reduce mortality in shrimp (Westenberg et al., 2005), and neither sequence-dependent nor sequence-independent siRNAs could induce the antiviral action (Robalino et al., 2005). In this paper, we have synthesized five siRNAs targeting the five WSSV genes and studied their effectiveness in inhibiting WSSV replication in vivo. The five genes include DNA polymerase gene (dnapol), ribonucleotide reductase small subunit gene (rr2), thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase gene (tk-tmk), two structural protein genes vp24 and vp28. We showed that siRNAs targeting the mRNA of these genes effectively inhibited WSSV replication in shrimp, but the mutant siRNA could not inhibit expression of target genes of WSSV and viral replication. Our results suggest that siRNA technology might represent a potential therapeutic or preventive approach against shrimp viral diseases.",

The genes with important roles in WSSV replication, nucleotide metabolism and virus\u2013host interactions were chosen for the experiment. For example, DNA polymerase is an important enzyme for DNA replication of WSSV (Chen et al., 2002). Both of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and thymidine kinase & thymidylate kinase (TK-TMK) are the key enzymes of nucleotide metabolism (Tsai et al., 2000, Tzeng et al., 2002). VP28 is the major WSSV envelope protein related to systemic virus infection (van Hulten et al., 2001b), and VP24 is the basic WSSV nucleocapsid protein (van Hulten et al., 2000). The mutant siRNA was used as non-specific control for interference action of siRNAs. Delivery of the selected sequence-specific siRNAs resulted in increase of survival rate of shrimp infected by WSSV, as compared to the virus injected controls (Fig. 1\n). At 6 days post-infection (p.i.), the survival rates of shrimp injected with siRNAs for dnapol, rr2, tk-tmk, vp24 and vp28 genes were 50%, 50%, 66%, 33% and 33%, respectively, while the survival rate of the control shrimp was 0% (Fig. 1). At 10 days p.i. after siRNA and virus injection, the survival rates of shrimp of siDNApol, siRR2, siTK-TMK and siVP28 groups were 33%, and that of siVP24 group was 17%. Thus, the protection provided by specific siRNAs of WSSV genes was significant. However, the protection rate could not reach 100% by one injection. At the same time, the shrimp of control groups only injected with sequence-specific siRNA or PBS were all alive. These results indicated that these sequence-specific siRNAs were safe for shrimp.",

As a powerful tool, RNAi technology plays an important role in protecting host from viral infection (Ge et al., 2003), suppressing the transcription of viral genome (Yoshinouchi et al., 2003) and blocking viral replication (Hamasaki et al., 2003). The present work indicates that RNAi directed against WSSV genome could effectively block expression of target genes and viral replication. Thus, it is possible to use RNAi to silence viral gene expression and to inhibit viral replication in shrimp. RNAi also provides a useful tool for further study of gene functions in shrimp and for prevention and treatment of viral diseases in aquatic animals.",

            "text": "In this study, siRNAs were synthesized to target several major genes of WSSV, including structural proteins and enzymes involved in virus replication, transcription, and virus\u2013host interaction (Chen et al., 2002, Tsai et al., 2000, van Hulten et al., 2000). Among these five genes, dnapol, rr2 and tk-tmk were early expression genes and the other two (vp24 and vp28) were late expression genes (Liu et al., 2005, Marks et al., 2003). In mammalian cells, ribonucleotide reductase (RR) catalyzes the reaction in which 2\u2032-deoxyribonucleotides (dADP, dGDP, dUDP, and dCDP) are synthesized from the corresponding ribonucleoside 5\u2032-diphosphates (ADP, GDP, UDP, and CDP) (Engstr\u00f6m et al., 1985). In addition, the level and activity of ribonucleotide reductase are highly regulated by the cell cycle (Yao et al., 2003). Consequently, some large DNA viruses such as herpesviruses and poxviruses can synthesis their own ribonucleotide reductases to replicate in non-dividing cells in which the cellular ribonucleotide reductase expression level is low (Lin et al., 2002). Besides ribonucleotide reductase, thymidine kinase (TK) and thymidylate kinase (TK-TMK) are also important enzymes of nucleotide biosynthesis in WSSV replication. TK and TMK are related to virulence influence (Stanberry et al., 1985, Tzeng et al., 2002). VP28 is identified as a major envelope protein of WSSV and is involved in viral infection (van Hulten et al., 2001b). In contrast, VP24 is a nucleocapsid protein of WSSV and its function is still unclear (van Hulten et al., 2000). We designed one specific siRNA (21 nt) corresponding the conservative region of each selected genes, all of which proved to be effective (Fig. 2B). The results showed that delivery of sequence-specific siRNAs could result in significant reduction of the corresponding gene expression (Fig. 2A), and decrease the number of WSSV virions (Fig. 3). It was more important that the death of shrimp infected by WSSV was delayed after injecting sequence-dependent siRNAs into the shrimp (Fig. 1). Therefore we concluded that the anti-WSSV activity is probably the result of siRNA-mediated WSSV RNA degradation in shrimp. The silencing of the non-structural viral protein genes (dnapol, rr2 and tk-tmk) increased the shrimp survival rate more than the silencing of the structural protein genes (vp24 and vp28). But the reduction of vp24 and vp28 gene expression was greater than the reduction of the other 3 genes. siRNA silencing experiments were repeated three times, and the results were consistent. It is worth further investigation to see whether the metabolism related genes expressed in early replication stage would play a more critical role in WSSV replication.",

The results showed that siMUT could not inhibit the expression of vp28 and the other four selected genes of WSSV (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the viral replication did not decrease (Fig. 3) and the death of shrimp infected by WSSV did not delay by the control siMUT (Fig. 1). Thus, the observation of this study suggested that siRNAs mediated significant reduction specifically, and not a global down-regulation resulting from activation of the dsRNA-activated RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), which could lead to an innate immunoreaction in a non-sequence-specific manner (Hannon, 2002; Robalino et al., 2004). Meanwhile, our results showed that interference was sequence-specific using siRNAs. However, in a recent RNAi research in shrimp in vivo (Westenberg et al., 2005), GFP-siRNA (non-specific siRNA control) induced reduction of shrimp mortality. In other species such as mice (Flynn et al., 2004, Tompkins et al., 2004), GFP-siRNA as controls did not inhibit the expression of target gene and viral replication in vivo. This phenomenon was interesting and worth further investigation.",

Although WSSV infection is a major problem in shrimp aquaculture worldwide, there is no effective antiviral treatment. siRNA technology may provide a possible therapeutic strategy against WSSV infection. Recently, several researches about RNAi in shrimp and the results of our study suggested that effective time of RNAi in vivo is limited, and the delivery efficiency of dsRNA or siRNA is not difficult to control and detect (Robalino et al., 2004, Westenberg et al., 2005). The half-life of synthetic RNA duplexes is very short. In some circumstances, these siRNAs will not stay long enough for complete elimination of virus replication in an infected cell. Further studies are necessary to construct high expression vectors and better transfection approaches of dsRNA/siRNA in shrimp in vivo. Therefore, it is necessary to study siRNA injection continuously into shrimp instead of single injection so that the siRNA may perform more effectively. Moreover, a permanent shrimp cell line would bring further advantages.",
