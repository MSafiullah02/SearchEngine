Lymphadenopathy may be present as a primary sign in neoplastic conditions, such as juvenile lymphosarcoma and adult lymphosarcoma (Figure 4-3, Figure 4-4\n), or as a secondary sign, in cases of soft tissue infections. Unilateral Horner's syndrome and progressive exophthalmos have been observed in slow-growing adenocarcinomas of respiratory epithelial origin in the nasal pharynx (Figure 4-5\n). Cattle with unilateral nasal obstruction often show more obvious respiratory signs during hot weather. One cow with Horner's syndrome would demonstrate open mouth breathing on hot days because of the nasal mucosal vasodilation and edema (Figure 4-6\n). A fetid odor may exist on the breath caused by chronic inflammation or tumor necrosis in some cattle. The owner may report a progressive course of stertorous breathing eventually leading to open mouth breathing. Inflammatory lesions often have a more acute course than neoplasms, but this is a generality rather than a rule.

When acute sinusitis follows recent dehorning, purulent drainage or heavy scabs may be observed at the wound in the cornual portion of the sinus. A multitude of bacteria such as A. pyogenes, Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli, and anaerobes may contribute to acute frontal sinus infection.

Chronic frontal sinusitis associated with old dehorning complications such as low-grade infection, bony skull fragments, or sequestra typically is associated with infection by A. pyogenes or mixed infections that may include A. pyogenes, P. multocida, anaerobes, or miscellaneous gram-negative organisms. Signs of chronic frontal sinusitis include gradual loss of condition and production that may be constant or intermittent; unilateral nasal discharge usually is observed, again as a persistent or intermittent complaint. Additional signs include head pressing, an extended head and neck, partially closed eyes, or resting of the muzzle on inanimate objects, all of which signal headache or pain. Intermittent or consistent fever is present. Bony expansions of the sinus may occur, causing asymmetric facial distortion\u2014especially in cattle that do not have significant nasal discharge because of occlusion or obstruction of the ethmoidal meatus opening into the nasal cavity. In fact, some cattle will have intermittent bony swelling of the sinus that becomes less apparent during times of sinus drainage with subsequent nasal discharge. Palpation or percussion of the frontal bone overlying the affected sinus causes pain, and the patient is extremely apprehensive when the examiner approaches the head. Bony expansion of the sinus may result in ipsilateral exophthalmos and decreased air movement through the ipsilateral nasal passage (Figure 4-8\n). Neurologic complications, including septic meningitis, dural abscesses, and pituitary abscesses, are possible in neglected cases as a result of erosion of the bony sinus. Tetanus is another potential complication. Occasionally cattle with chronic frontal sinusitis have developed orbital cellulitis, pathologic exophthalmos, or facial abscesses from infectious destruction of the postorbital diverticula of the sinus, allowing soft tissue infection of the orbit (Figure 4-9\n).",

Attempts to establish rostral-medial drainage in these animals may risk invasion of the calvarium.

Several properties of M. haemolytica contribute to its pathogenicity. These include a capsule that provides defense against phagocytosis; production of an exotoxin (leukotoxin) lethal to alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils; cell wall\u2013derived endotoxin that helps to initiate complement and coagulation cascades; and the ability to reside in the upper airway among other nonpathogenic serotypes and then convert and/or overgrow under stressful stimuli to a pathogenic serotype, A1, that is more virulent. The cytotoxicity of the leukotoxin is associated with its ability to bind and interact with B2 integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen 1. Currently M. haemolytica is a leading cause of death as a result of respiratory infection in dairy cattle and calves in most areas of the United States. This organism is a primary pathogen not always needing assistance from other viral or Mycoplasma agents to establish lower airway infection, although it is well demonstrated that bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) infection can activate genes that will increase leukotoxin binding, cytotoxicity to bovine mononuclear cells, and the severity of M. haemolytica infection. When a virus such as IBR, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), or bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) does infect a herd, mortality will be greatly increased if M. haemolytica bronchopneumonia is superimposed. In this situation, the bacteria may cause death because the viral infection compromises mechanical and cellular defense mechanisms. Mortality may approach 30% to 50% when a virulent M. haemolytica infection is superimposed on a preexisting viral infection (e.g., BHV1 or BVDV) in a herd. Cattle that are stressed are at great risk of M. haemolytica pneumonia because stress triggers both activation of the organism to a more virulent form, permits greater colonization of the virulent strain, and compromises the host defense mechanisms. Thus M. haemolytica is frequently isolated as the cause of \u201cshipping fever pneumonia\u201d associated with shipment of cattle, transport of cattle to shows, or recent purchase of replacement animals. Classic signs of pneumonia generally develop 1 to 2 weeks following any of these stresses. The morbidity and mortality percentages tend to be much greater for M. haemolytica pneumonia outbreaks than if P. multocida is found as the cause of shipping fever.",

Signs in acutely affected cattle include high fever (106.0 to 108.0\u00b0 F/41.11 to 42.22\u00b0 C), marked depression, salivation, increased respiratory rate (60 to 120 breaths/min), complete anorexia and milk cessation, reluctance to move, absence of rales when the ventral lungs are ausculted, profound bronchial tones bilaterally that indicate consolidation of 25% to 75% of the ventral pulmonary parenchyma (Figure 4-18\n), and quiet or inaudible sounds in the dorsal lungs where the remaining pulmonary tissue has been subjected to extreme mechanical and physiologic stress to maintain gas exchange. Subcutaneous emphysema and pulmonary edema are common sequelae in these cattle. Ventral abdominal pain can be elicited in the cranial abdomen as a result of the fibrinous pleuritis present. This pain and absence of rumen activity coupled with the other signs have caused many veterinarians to confuse the initial case of rapidly consolidating pneumonia as peritonitis caused by hardware or perforating abomasal ulcer.

Therefore we have had to \u201cretrain\u201d our ears to auscult carefully for bronchial tones versus normal or harsh vesicular sounds. Careless auscultation of air sounds in the ventral lung field may not discriminate between bronchial tones and vesicular sounds.

Because life-threatening signs usually appear in at least some of the affected cattle, the veterinarian is more likely to select broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately. The current popular antibiotics for cows and calves are shown in Table 4-1\n. Even when the causative bacterial organism is known, antibiotic therapy may be unable to cure the patient for a variety of reasons, such as the chosen antibiotic does not reach adequate tissue levels in the lung; the organism is resistant to the antibiotic; the organism is sensitive in vitro but in vitro inhibitory concentrations do not occur in the cow as a result of the dose, frequency of dosage, or other pharmacologic considerations; the drug may not be able to penetrate consolidated tissue or work in purulent tissue; and in vitro susceptibility tests may not reflect in vivo success of an antibiotic against a specific organism\u2014thus the Kirby-Bauer disc assay has been criticized as too gross compared with mean inhibitory or bactericidal concentration tests that can give a concentration of drug that inhibits or kills an organism. This mean inhibitory concentration then can be compared with known achievable blood and tissue levels of the antibiotic in the cow to determine likelihood of successful treatment. The pathology may be irreversible or viral, and Mycoplasma or A. pyogenes pathogens may coexist to complicate the treatment plan. Textbook charts that quote percentages of isolates sensitive to various antibiotics are seldom helpful because both geographic differences in strains and temporal resistance patterns occur.

Therefore initial treatment is based on previous experience, geographic differences in antibiotic sensitivity, and economic factors. Animals that are febrile, anorectic, and dyspneic require treatment. Other animals that have mild fever and depression but continue to eat and do not act very ill may not require treatment. Individual or small groups of sick animals may be treated empirically if fatalities are not anticipated. However, if an epidemic situation is apparent, it always is best to do transtracheal washes from several animals before any treatment.

The two general groups of drugs include corticosteroids and NSAIDs, such as aspirin and flunixin meglumine. Corticosteroids have a marked antiinflammatory and antipyretic activity that often leads to a \u201csteroid euphoria\u201d with resultant improved attitude and appetite within 24 hours. Although corticosteroids have these positive effects and also block several parts of the inflammatory cycle, they are dangerous if used repeatedly or in high dosages. Corticosteroids may reduce some of the chemotactic factors and lysosomal enzymes that cause a vicious cycle of increasing inflammation in the lung and tend to stabilize small vessels. However, they also partially or completely inhibit macrophage activation and antimicrobial peptide expression, which are serious detriments to the defense mechanisms of the lower airway. If the veterinarian elects to use corticosteroids, one treatment of low-dose (10 to 20 mg/450 kg) dexamethasone may be given as part of the initial therapy and should not be used thereafter. This treatment cannot be used in pregnant cows because of the abortifacient qualities of dexamethasone. Corticosteroids have potent antipyretic properties, and this may lead to a false sense of security because the veterinarian may assume that the proper antibiotic has been used based on a decreasing fever 24 hours following treatment when in fact the antibiotic has not been effective and fever will return 24 to 48 hours later.

Occasionally aspirin and flunixin meglumine have caused abomasal ulceration when administered for a prolonged time to sick cattle. Renal toxicity also is a risk\u2014especially in a dehydrated animal in which the cytoprotective and vascular effects of prostaglandins are essential during reduced renal perfusion. I prefer flunixin when NSAID therapy is selected, but similar to corticosteroids, these drugs are adjuncts, not essentials, for the treatment of bronchopneumonia caused by P. multocida.",

The history usually indicates illness of at least 1 week's duration or recurrent episodes of pneumonia over weeks to months. There may only be one (usually adult cattle) or a few animals (usually calves) affected out of a group or herd. In adult dairy cattle, it is common for clinical signs to develop following freshening (Figure 4-24\n). In some cases, there may be severe subcutaneous emphysema over the dorsum, suggesting a rupture of diseased alveoli associated with calving as a cause of the pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and sometimes pneumothorax. Although this should be considered in cattle with dorsal emphysema following calving, similar emphysema may be found sometimes in apparently healthy cattle following calving and of course in cattle with interstitial pneumonia. Affected animals may show low-grade fever (103.0 to 105.0\u00b0 F/39.44 to 40.56\u00b0 C), rapid respiratory rate (40 to 100 breaths/min), dyspnea characterized by exaggerated inspiratory and especially expiratory efforts (particularly when stressed), head and neck extension when lying down, cough, nasal discharge (Figure 4-25\n), rough hair coat, poor body condition, depression, inappetence, or decreased milk production.

High environmental temperatures, high humidity, and poor ventilation exacerbate the clinical signs. A fetid smell may be present following a cough if anaerobic bacteria are present. Auscultation during rebreathing, paying close attention to the cranioventral lung fields under the triceps musculature for the presence of bronchial tones indicative of consolidation, is important when investigating possible cases of mild to moderate chronic suppurative bronchopneumonia.",

M. dispar and M. bovis probably are the two major types identified. The organisms may be normal inhabitants of the upper airway in some cattle. Experimentally, Mycoplasma spp. have caused pneumonia in calves when introduced into the lower airway. This pneumonia is characterized by peribronchiolar and peribronchial lymphoid hyperplasia and purulent bronchiolitis. Lesions usually are limited to the anterior ventral tips of the lung lobes, and the associated clinical signs are mild. Gross inspection at necropsy reveals ventral areas of lung lobes that are red-blue and firm, appear almost as atelectatic areas, and ooze purulent material from the airways on cut sections. Mycoplasma pneumonia has been described as a \u201ccuffing pneumonia\u201d because lymphoid hyperplasia appears around the airways and expands with time. Mycoplasma organisms have several properties that contribute to their pathogenicity, including inhibition of the mucociliary transport mechanism (at least in humans); they cause some degree of humoral and cell-mediated immunosuppression in calves; and they avoid phagocytosis by attaching to ciliated epithelium above the level of alveolar macrophages.",

However, Mycoplasma sp. seldom is the only pathogen isolated in these outbreaks, and H. somni, P. multocida, and M. haemolytica usually are isolated as well. Because Mycoplasma appears ubiquitous on many farms, we wonder whether the Mycoplasma infection has been present in the calves' lungs for a long time and contributes to impaired host defense against bacterial and viral pathogens or whether the Mycoplasma infection is acute along with the other pathogens. In herds with Mycoplasma pneumonia, Mycoplasma frequently can be isolated from almost all adult cows and calves\u2014most of which appear healthy. Therefore the ubiquitous nature of the organism makes it nearly impossible for calves on these farms not to be infected. The subsequent low grade pneumonia and defense mechanism compromise caused by the Mycoplasma infection may precede the onset of clinical pneumonia caused by bacterial and viral pathogens. How significant Mycoplasma sp. is to the entire problem is difficult to determine, but we believe it increases the risk of calfhood pneumonia. In addition to pneumonia, M. bovis may also cause otitis media, mastitis, and arthritis once it becomes established in a herd. Some of the spread is likely from feeding infected milk. Effective control measures for Mycoplasma when it is ubiquitous on a premise are challenging and made more so because effective vaccines are not available. In endemic herds, the feeding of waste milk is a known risk factor for transmission of the organism to calves, and this practice should be actively discouraged. Pasteurization will remove the risk of Mycoplasma spread by this means but only makes economic sense on larger dairies or heifer-rearing operations.",

Calf hutches and individual rearing of calves may not be effective in preventing Mycoplasma infection in some of these herds, but calf hutches do seem to prevent bacterial infection in the calves. Therefore as soon as the calves are grouped following weaning, a pneumonia outbreak is caused by both bacterial and Mycoplasma components. Every new group seems to be affected, and attempts at prevention appear futile. Isolation of calves to a separate farm following immediate removal from their dams may be the only solution.

Infection may assume many forms in cattle, including respiratory, conjunctival, or infectious pustular vulvovaginitis affecting the caudal reproductive tract, infectious balanoposthitis of the male external genitalia, endemic abortions, and the neonatal septicemic form characterized by encephalitis and focal plaque necrosis of the tongue. Bovine herpesvirus 5 (BoHV5) may also cause outbreaks of encephalitis in young stock. The respiratory form of BHV1 is the most common and may occur alone or coupled with the conjunctival form. DNA variants of BHV1 initially described correlated to specific system disease, but recent genomic mapping has found no basis for these divisions. Abortions may occur in association with any of the forms of the disease, either during the acute disease or in the ensuing weeks following an endemic. Each infected herd seems to have one predominant clinical form of the disease, but occasional animals may also show signs of other forms during an endemic. Recent work suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the relative resistance of cattle to IBR virus and that this resistance may be mediated by type 1 interferon genotypes.",

The virus certainly may have been present for much longer, but new diagnostic procedures, increased technology in virology, and recognition of the virus and its pathophysiology have heightened awareness of this disease. The virus is a pneumovirus within the paramyxovirus family and is distinctly different from the bovine syncytial virus (BSV), which is a spumavirus in the retrovirus family. There is no current evidence that the BSV is a pathogen in cattle. Respiratory disease caused by BRSV was first reported in Europe during the 1970s and has been recognized throughout the United States in the 1980s in endemic form in beef and dairy cattle. Experimental and natural diseases have been reported, and it is now accepted that BRSV is likely the cause of many poorly defined epidemics heretofore diagnosed as \u201catypical interstitial pneumonia\u201d in calves and cattle. It also is likely that BRSV infection has proceeded, and predisposed cattle to, severe bacterial bronchopneumonia but gone undiagnosed because of overwhelming bacterial lesions.",

Based on surveys completed in several regions of the United States, BRSV infection appears common in cattle because 50% or more of cattle surveyed have titers to BRSV. The virus has caused sporadic clinical disease in dairy cattle and calves and probably has gone undiagnosed frequently. Outbreaks of BRSV may be limited to calves, affect only adult cows, or can involve all animals in a herd. Morbidity is high, but mortality as a result of BRSV infection is much lower unless secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia ensues. The virus apparently does not infect alveolar macrophages but may damage physical defense mechanisms of the lower airway, such as mucociliary transport, and may lead to antigen-antibody complexes that subsequently engage complement and result in damage to the lower airway. Although experimental reproduction of the clinical disease has not been consistently successful in challenge studies, there have been recent studies that help explain the pathogenesis of the disease further. Two- to 6-month-old calves have been successfully infected and have marked production of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 6, and interferon); these are thought to help promote viral clearance but may have a pathogenic role in causing airway obstruction. Previous work suggests that BRSV alters macrophage function sufficiently to short cycle and depress responsiveness of lymphocytes. In any event, interstitial pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, airway obstruction, and pneumothorax are very common following BRSV infection. Many unexplained facets of BRSV infection persist despite the proliferation of research on the virus. For example, BRSV infection often arises in herds that appear to have excellent management and have not purchased new cattle, shipped and returned existing cattle, or stressed animals in any apparent way. Where did the infection come from in these herds? Was it latent in a recovered animal, or was it introduced by regular visitors to the farm? Cattle are thought to be the reservoir, but it has not yet been shown how or why the virus activates, replicates, and spreads to cause all clinical epidemics.",

Clinical signs include high fever (104.0 to 108.0\u00b0 F/40.0 to 42.22\u00b0 C); depression, anorexia, and decreased milk production; salivation and serous or mucoid nasal discharge; degree of dyspnea varies from simple increased respiratory rate (40 to 100 breaths/min) to open mouth breathing; and in all but the most mild outbreaks, a percentage of the affected cattle will have subcutaneous emphysema palpable under the skin of the dorsum, especially near the withers (Figure 4-33\n). Auscultation of the lungs in acute cases may reveal a wide range of sounds. Increased bronchovesicular sounds, bronchial tones, fine crepitation caused by emphysema, and rales (usually as a result of secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia) have been described. In New York, practitioners have found the lungs may auscult as diffusely very quiet or almost inaudible in acutely affected cattle in some outbreaks. This has been a very important sign and initially appears in contrast to the outward signs of dyspnea displayed by these cattle. However, the relative deficit of airway sounds fits the existing pathology because pneumothorax and/or diffuse interstitial edema and emphysema compress the small airways and cause the lungs to be quieter than one would expect (Figure 4-34, Figure 4-35\n). This is the same phenomenon that occurs in proliferative pneumonia in which the alveoli and small airways are obliterated or reduced in size. If secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs, bronchial tones or rales are heard in the anterior ventral lung region, and the dorsal and caudal lungs become quieter because of mechanical overwork, increasing the degree of edema and emphysema. Dyspnea will be severe in such cases, and affected animals usually show open mouth breathing and an audible grunt or groan with each expiration. This dyspnea is more obvious if affected animals are stressed by handling or being made to move. Despite the high fevers and respiratory distress, affected cattle frequently do not look septic (e.g., severe depression, scleral injection) as with acute overwhelming bacterial pneumonia.",

These signs are rarely seen in calves younger than 6 weeks, but calves aged 2 to 6 months seem to be most commonly affected. Auscultation of the lungs in acute cases may be helpful if the lungs sound diffusely quiet despite obvious severe dyspnea. The veterinarian must be cautious in diagnosing BRSV based only on the finding of subcutaneous emphysema or pneumothorax in some animals. Any severe pneumonia (especially other interstitial pneumonias or severe consolidating bronchopneumonia) can also cause subcutaneous emphysema because the only remaining normal lung tissue (dorsal or caudal lung fields) is overworked to the point at which emphysema and interstitial edema are likely. Therefore subcutaneous emphysema may be suggestive of but not pathognomonic for BRSV. As with most of the diseases discussed thus far, laboratory confirmation is the only definitive means to confirm a diagnosis of BRSV. Viral cultures from tracheal wash fluid or necropsy specimens are indicated but often are not rewarding because BRSV is quickly cleared from the respiratory tract or a rapidly developing secretory antibody neutralizes the virus within the respiratory tract. The best results are from viral cultures or FA testing taken in the very early stages of the disease and quickly transported unfrozen to a diagnostic laboratory equipped with appropriate cell cultures. FA techniques may be used for tracheal wash samples, nasopharyngeal smears, and necropsy specimens of infected lung. Serology is helpful in establishing a diagnosis of BRSV because a marked humoral antibody titer occurs in response to the infection. Baker and Frey emphasize that antibody titers may increase early after acute infection and often peak before 2 weeks postinfection. Therefore collection of serum on day 1 and day 14 is very important when evaluating seroconversion. The same authors state that young calves may have titers derived from colostrum. These titers, indicative of passive immunity, are not protective against BRSV infection. Thus older calves, heifers, or adult animals are better populations to sample. Necropsy specimens may be very helpful in establishing a diagnosis. This is especially true if death has been acute and secondary bacterial pneumonia has not yet developed to somewhat mask the pulmonary lesions caused by BRSV. In pure BRSV infection, diffuse edema and emphysema may be present (see Figure 4-35). In addition, focal firm areas of pneumonia will be palpable throughout the entire lung. Lesions are not limited to any one area of lung tissue. If secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia coexists with BRSV, the anterior ventral lung fields usually are dark colored, firm, fibrin covered, and consolidated (Figure 4-36\n). In this instance, typical BRSV lesions of emphysema, edema, and scattered palpably firm areas will be found in the lung caudal and dorsal to the consolidated areas.",

Alveolar macrophages are frequently infected with BVDV, which would be expected to have a direct negative effect on lung protection against invading bacteria. Therefore the results are devastating if a cow or group of cows acutely infected with BVDV has the bad fortune to become infected with P. multocida, M. haemolytica, or H. somni pneumonia at the same time. Bacterial bronchopneumonia may progress rapidly because host defense mechanisms are negligible. In addition, cattle may die so quickly from severe pneumonia that necropsy identifies bacterial pneumonia as the cause of death.

When the environment is managed in this way, most bacterial and viral pneumonias will be prevented, primarily by ensuring good ventilation that dilutes potential pathogens. Mycoplasma may be a herd problem even with good environmental management. Feeding of contaminated colostrum or waste milk is thought to be the primary means of transmitting Mycoplasma to young calves. Aerosol spread may subsequently occur to calves housed with or very near infected calves. Use of colostrum replacer, milk replacer, and pasteurization of waste milk are all alternatives to prevent exposure of young calves. Recent studies of heat-treating colostrum have shown that heating to less than pasteurization temperatures is very effective in killing important calf pathogens without damaging the immunoglobulins. Heating to 140\u00b0 F (60\u00b0 C) for 30 minutes eliminates M. bovis from colostrum.

Exhaled bacteria and viruses are included in microscopic droplets of moisture. Prevention of respiratory infections in these settings requires improvement in the ventilation to dilute the pathogens and remove the irritants. There is a wealth of information on techniques for designing or retrofitting appropriate ventilation systems available from agricultural engineers through the extension services of each state. If the walls or ceiling accumulate condensation or the odor of ammonia in the barn is noticeable, there is inadequate ventilation. Normally the inside temperature in these barns in winter should not exceed 50\u00b0 F (10\u00b0 C).

Prevention consists both of effective vaccination programs and management designed to reduce the probability of infectious respiratory disease. Currently, effective vaccines are available for IBR, PI3, and BVDV. Vaccines against H. somni and P. multocida, although available, have not been proven to be of any benefit. Newer vaccines against M. haemolytica that are based on leukotoxins of this bacterium have been proven beneficial in reducing morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle. No comparable data have been published for dairy cattle, but by extension a benefit is probable if mannheimiosis were to occur. Vaccination strategies for herds should be individually determined and include the assessment of risk for all age groups. Closed herds in isolated settings have a much lower risk of contagious pathogens than herds that continuously purchase animals or exhibit cattle. Regardless, primary immunization requires two doses of vaccine and is best done at an early age. Optimal response to vaccines occurs after the waning of colostrally derived antibodies. Thus current recommendations are to begin the primary series at about 3 months of age with the second dose administered 2 to 4 weeks later. Recent research indicates the greatest response to immunization against IBR and BVDV occurs if the first two doses are a killed product and the subsequent booster is a modified live vaccine. All major vaccine producers offer combination products with options of killed virus or modified live virus that provide the four viral components in a single injection. The M. haemolytica leukotoxoids are usually a distinct product. Subsequent boosters are administered at frequencies that correspond to the perceived risk and usually at times or ages that offer some convenience to management. The duration of immunity following proper vaccination is mostly not known for each of the components of the routinely used products. Thus recommendations for low-risk herds may be annual revaccination of the entire herd, whereas high-risk herds may be given boosters two or three times per year. Alternatively, in many large herds adults are vaccinated in conjunction with the lactation cycle. For example, a modified live booster is given at 30 days in milk, and killed boosters are given at 120 and 240 days of gestation.",

Another widely used strategy for undifferentiated respiratory disease of recently weaned calves is metaphylaxis of the at-risk group. Current practice in many dairies is to wean a group of calves and move them within 1 week or so to group housing. This change, particularly when more than 10 calves in a group are moved at one time, seems to be a trigger for respiratory disease. Control has been achieved in many herds with mass medication at the time of a move with a single injection of a long-acting antibiotic such as oxytetracycline, tilmicosin, tulathromycin, or florfenicol or by feeding chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine pellets for 5 to 7 days.

Although most ingested larvae are killed or fail to mature in previously infected cattle, heavy exposure apparently allows large numbers of larvae to reach the lungs and cause respiratory signs through either an immune-mediated means and/or from migration of large numbers of larvae into the lung. Signs usually develop 14 to 16 days following exposure to contaminated pastures. Coughing that is frequent and deep, as well as an increased respiratory rate, characterizes the syndrome.

Highly acidic diets that predispose to clinical or subclinical rumenitis and abomasal ulceration have to be tempered by buffers, prefeeding hay before high energy grains such as high moisture corn, or by feeding total mixed rations. Dairy rations should not be fed to yearling or bred heifers. High production herds are most at risk for rumenitis and abomasal ulceration secondary to intensive feeding of high-energy acid diets. Most cattle with liver abscesses are asymptomatic, and those having hilar abscesses probably suffered initiation of pathophysiology months to years before the onset of clinical signs. When more than an occasional case of caudal vena caval thrombosis appears in a herd, immediate evaluation of the herd's nutritional program is in order. One cow in a herd with caudal vena caval thrombosis is unfortunate but a common clinical problem. More than one cow in the same herd with caudal vena caval thrombosis, however, signals a potential serious economic loss and requires changes in the feeding program. Evaluation of the herd for subacute rumen acidosis is indicated under these circumstances and is described in Chapter 5.",

This neurogenic injury may lead to dysphagia and to defective eructationand regurgitation, and may predispose to inhalation pneumonia. Inadvertent intubation of the trachea during attempts at stomach tubing by an unskilled person creates a significant risk of inhalation in adult cattle as in calves.

Pulmonary edema is an early sign of severe thermal damage and suggests that subsequent pathology with hyaline membrane formation will follow. Other signs in severely affected animals include cough, tachypnea, wheezing, cyanosis, and stridor. In severe cases, respiratory distress will develop 1 to 24 hours following initial injury, and bacterial bronchopneumonia may develop within 1 to 4 days in cattle that survive the initial thermal injury.

As a result of this contact, moist tissue rapidly desiccates followed by necrosis as the chemical dehydrates the tissue. Corneal edema, epithelial necrosis, and corneal stromal burns immediately develop in the eyes.

Use of corticosteroids for acute pulmonary distress caused by thermal injury is controversial. Steroids have been proposed as initial therapy to \u201cshort cycle\u201d parts of the vicious cycle of inflammation because they decrease mediators of inflammation, stabilize inflamed vasculature, and decrease edema of the upper and lower airway. If steroids are used, they should be given immediately rather than waiting for the subsequent pathology and respiratory distress that will follow thermal injury in the following 1 to 24 hours. Dosages vary but may be as high as 0.1 to 1.0 mg/lb dexamethasone as a one-time treatment. Abortifacient properties of the drug need to be considered before it is used on pregnant animals, and a significant risk associated with the use of steroids in the form of possible secondary bronchopneumonia also must be considered before dexamethasone's use. Dr. Rebhun commented that he had treated some barn fire victims with dexamethasone but that the results were hard to interpret. In one valuable yearling bull, a high dose of corticosteroids was used initially without respiratory consequences, but the bull developed a left displacement of the abomasum within 24 hours of treatment. The cause/effect relationship of the exogenous source of corticosteroids on the displacement never was confirmed but certainly was suspicious. NSAIDs may be used at regular dosages without the additional risks presented by corticosteroids. However, NSAIDs probably do not block the ongoing pathophysiology of lower airway disease corticosteroids. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics are reported not to influence the subsequent development of bacterial bronchopneumonia. Some literature regarding usage in humans discourages the use of prophylactic antibiotics for fear of allowing resistant strains of bacteria to emerge in the lower airway. In cattle, especially valuable ones, broad-spectrum antibiotics usually are used on a prophylactic basis, although no controlled data support their use. Tetracyclines may help decrease inflammation via their inhibitory effect on metalloproteinases. Disadvantages of tetracyclines would be that they are bacteriostatic and many commensal organisms may be resistant to the drug. If used, practitioners should be aware of their potential to cause nephrotoxicity, particularly in hemodynamically challenged patients. If tracheostomies or tracheal washes are performed, extreme care should be taken to minimize iatrogenic introduction of pathogens into the respiratory tract.

The disease occurs in a single animal among a group of calves affected by Pasteurella or Mannheimia pneumonia 2 to 4 weeks previously that had seemingly recovered. This single animal develops an acute severe respiratory distress syndrome with tachypnea, hyperpnea, elevated heart rate, open mouth breathing, fever (103.0 to 106.0\u00b0 F/39.44 to 41.11\u00b0 C), and pulmonary edema and may have an expiratory grunt.

The lungs are very quiet on auscultation and have reduced sounds throughout all fields. If the previous pneumonia resulted in consolidation of anterior ventral lung lobes, bronchial tones may be heard ventrally and reduced sounds elsewhere. Usually both lungs are involved, but occasionally one lung has much more serious lesions. Unless treated quickly and intensively, the calf dies within 24 hours. Gross necropsy reveals diffusely heavy, wet, firm lungs with evidence of resolved or resolving anterior ventral pneumonia (Figure 4-53\n).

When proliferative pneumonia is confirmed or strongly suspected, the following therapy is suggested:Remove affected cattle from any source of toxic plants, nitrogen gases, or fumes; for example, if the only affected cows are confined near a silo chute or manure pit, move them. Affected cattle should be moved only when their ventilation and environment need to be improved. Otherwise, any movement constitutes a severe stress.Furosemide (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg or 25 to 50 mg/100 lb body weight by injection once or twice daily) for the first 2 days of therapy if hydration status allows.Atropine (0.048 mg/kg or 1/30 grain [2.2 mg] per 100 lb body weight twice daily).Dexamethasone (10 to 20 mg once daily) for 3 days unless the affected cow is pregnant.Broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 to 7 days to protect against secondary bacterial pneumonia.\n",

Lung sounds are diffusely harsh and generally do not have rales. The heart rate will be high, but loud murmurs are usually absent unless the respiratory distress is caused by a congenital heart defect. An arterial sample can be collected from the brachial artery to confirm the severity of the hypoxemia. In some cases, the CO2 will be elevated, and this can be confirmed by a venous sample (.45 mm Hg). If the CO2 is elevated in a rapidly breathing calf, the PaO2 will be extremely low. Pulse oximetry is useful in calves to confirm the hypoxemia and for monitoring therapy. A chest radiograph will reveal diffuse underinflation of the lung and parenchymal collapse. Some premature calves will have moderate to severe respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia but because of inappropriate/underdeveloped central responses will appear eupneic or only slightly tachypneic.

Intranasal oxygen must be administered and the calf given prophylactic antibiotics. One dose of corticosteroid (10 mg of dexamethasone) is often given and empirically does seem to help, especially following meconium aspiration. Although it is proven that corticosteroids given to cattle in the last 2 weeks of gestation improve lung function at birth in cesarean-derived calves, there is limited proof that postnatal-administered steroids will similarly accelerate lung maturation. It may be that postnatal-administered steroids, if they help at all, are inhibiting oxidative lung damage in the hypoxic calf. If surfactant is available, it should be given to the calf via intratracheal instillation via a tube, less commonly by direct injection, or it can be nebulized. Commercially prepared surfactant is preferred, but we have collected surfactant from healthy donor cows by bronchoalveolar lavage using 100 ml of sterile saline and then using the top (foamy) part of the collection for intratracheal administration or nebulization. We have also nebulized the affected calves with acetylcysteine while they were being administered an aminophylline drip. The aminophylline not only serves as a bronchodilator but also has antiinflammatory properties and helps maintain diaphragm strength. Fluids (crystalloids and colloids such as plasma) may be given IV as a continuous drip if needed. We have also administered thyrotropin releasing factor and/or thyroxin in hopes of increasing surfactant production. If pulmonary gas exchange cannot be sufficiently improved with the above and the owners request further treatment, the calf can be placed on a mechanical ventilator, but this is expensive. It is sometimes more difficult to keep calves quiet on a ventilator as compared with foals. Cloned calves with ascites and enlarged umbilical vessels seldom survive even when placed on the ventilator. Persistent pulmonary hypertension causes progression of right heart failure and sometimes reversion to fetal circulation patterns. Nitric oxide (ratio NO to oxygen 5 1:9) can be administered through the oxygen line in hopes of decreasing the pulmonary hypertension (Figure 4-55\n).

Certain biologics have been incriminated more than others in this regard. Antibiotic-induced anaphylaxis has been observed as a result of penicillin, tetracycline, sulfas, and other antibiotics. Penicillin may cause respiratory distress from a true anaphylaxis (usually hives accompany the respiratory distress) or as part of the procaine reaction. Biologics that cause an anaphylactic reaction in more than an occasional cow should be avoided unless suitable alternatives are not available.
