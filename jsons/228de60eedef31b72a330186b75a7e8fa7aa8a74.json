EBOV comprises the species Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV), and Reston ebolavirus (REBOV). As agents of human disease, filoviruses are usually encountered in the context of outbreaks in Africa. Imported cases of filovirus infection are very rare. Nevertheless, potential importation of filoviruses by returning travelers is a frequent concern because of symptom similarity with other dis-eases-for example, malaria-and the risk of nosocomial filovirus transmission. Although, in a confirmed outbreak situation, case definitions can partially substitute for laboratory tests [1] , in suspected cases of importation, laboratory diagnosis is always required. Severely ill patients have to be tested for a number of hemorrhagic fever viruses (e.g., EBOV, MARV, Lassa virus, yellow fever virus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) in a very short time and with such high reliability that an excluding result can be issued [2] . Similar scenarios arise in the screening of sick nonhuman primates, in the monitoring of workers after laboratory accidents, and in the context of suspected bioterrorism.",

Seven new sequences for the target region were generated (GenBank accession no. EF490228, SEBOV Gulu 10/200; EF490229, ZEBOV Gabon 1995; EF490230, ZEBOV Gabon 2003; EF490231, ZEBOV Gabon 2001; EF490232, MARV Ravn; EF490233, CIEBOV) and used for assay design, together with the 8 sequences available at that time. Initially, attempts were made to keep the published Filo-A/Filo-B primer positions. However, Filo-A was not very appropriate for REBOV and CIEBOV. It was shifted downstream (positive mRNA sense), and a mix of 3 primers was used at a more appropriate binding site. This was also beneficial for obtaining a short amplification fragment, as required in probe-based real-time RT-PCR. Primer Filo-B could be kept, but it was supplemented by an additional oligonucleotide that was more specific for MARV. Three detection probes were formulated separately for ZEBOV/REBOV, SEBOV/CIEBOV, and MARV, as shown in figure 1A . With inosine-containing probes, it was possible to compensate for as many as 4 nucleotide mismatches, as maximally observed in EBOV, without losing signal intensity ( figure 1B and 1C ). For MARV, such an adaptation was not necessary. There was no need to change the assay design in view of more recently published filovirus sequences [10] . Figure 1A provides a summary of sequence diversity observed at all oligonucleotide binding sites, as updated in October 2006. Sequences from the 2005 outbreak of MARV infection in Uige, Angola, were not yet published when oligonucleotides were designed for this study, but compatibility with these sequences was confirmed to us before publication [11] .",

The feasibility of developing such kits through close collaboration with industry has been demonstrated in connection with the SARS outbreak in 2003, when a test kit was made available during the epidemic. The main purpose of the present study was to design a similar kit for filoviruses. Most of the preliminary work was done by academic and governmental institutions, lowering the financial entry threshold for a company that collaborated as a network partner. Kits could be produced in accordance with high quality standards, with features comparable to those of commercial diagnostic PCR systems (e.g., HIV-1, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus). This is the first probe-based assay compatible with all known filovirus species. An internal control monitors the sensitivity in every single reaction. Analytical properties have been evaluated in accordance with industry-approved standards, such as probit analysis with a broad range of filovirus strains, intra-and inter-assay variability analysis, and specificity testing with an exhaustive panel of viruses causing related clinical manifestations. These data not only will ensure wide acceptance of the assay as a standard test in Europe but could also serve as an entry point into production as an in vitro diagnostic procedure.",

Note that only representative sequences are shown. All sequences occurring more than once at each of the oligonucleotide binding sites have been deleted from the alignment. The alignment was updated in October 2006 with latest GenBank entries. The complete alignment can be retrieved from http://www.bni-hamburg.de/ebovalign. B, A probe matching ZEBOV (top panel), modified to adapt a single nucleotide mismatch as present in REBOV (probe EBOg, lower panel). No loss of signal occurred for ZEBOV (bottom panel), and the signal for REBOV improved (not shown; REBOV was not yet available at the time these experiments were performed). C, top panel, A probe containing 2 inosin residues at positions of variability but otherwise matching SEBOV (probe EBOSu), yielding a good detection signal (similar to the signal from a corresponding RNA concentration of ZEBOV; compare with panel B). C, middle panel, A probe of similar design, adapted to CIEBOV, yielding good signal for CIEBOV. However, because CIEBOV was also detectable with good efficiency with the EBOSu probe (C, bottom panel), EBOSu was used for both SEBOV and CIEBOV. D, Detection signals with oligonucleotides, as shown in panel A, in reactions containing low concentrations of virus RNA (flat lines denote controls; the figure shows signals with all probes and primers mixed in 1 reaction). E, Determination of working concentration for competitive internal control. A constant small amount of target gene RNA (solid line; 50 copies of ZEBOV transcript per assay) was amplified in the presence of increasing concentrations, as plotted on the X-axis, of the internal control (dotted line). Observed crossing point values were plotted on the Y-axis for both target genes (note that the virus and internal control carried different reporter dyes). Increasing values on the Y-axis indicate decreasing amplification efficiencies. From 40 copies of internal control onward, stable amplification was possible. From 400 copies/reaction (cps/rxn) onward, amplification of ZEBOV RNA lost efficiency, as is represented by the increasing crossing point value.",
