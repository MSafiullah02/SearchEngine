Recent news1 that researchers in the USA, Canada, and Hong Kong have applied for patents covering the SARS genome illustrates how the patent system is still not yet ready for the breakout of genomic patent claims. In particular, the news demonstrates that the patent system needs to be adjusted\u2014not discarded\u2014by governments to better reach the goal of that system: the attainment of the public good.",

As an alternative, these agencies could have published the genome, thus preventing others from being able to patent it. Instead they will eventually spend about US$10 000 per country to not only prevent others from patenting the genome but also to obtain the exclusive right to use and sell molecular forms of the genome.",

For there are good reasons why the CDC and the BCCA actually prefer the patent option. First, this option provides them with more leverage in dealing with the University of Hong Kong's Versitech Ltd, which has also applied for a patent. Second, and more importantly, publishing is not enough for the two agencies to prevent others from patenting the SARS genome given their goal of preserving the public domain.",

What this argument ignores is that, as genomic patents increase in number, it will become prohibitively expensive for public organisations to afford not only the expense of patenting genomes and DNA sequences, but also the significant costs of entering into licences and administering those licences. Expecting nonprofit organisations to obtain patents on all their genomic inventions is not a sustainable solution to maintaining an open and free public domain.",

Thus, if we keep our eye on the target of our efforts, we soon realise that the system as currently constructed fails to meet its own objectives. As the CDC's and BCCA's efforts illustrate, researchers are concerned that patents held in private hands will decrease research, particularly for the development of clinical applications such as genetic tests. Whilst empirical data are not yet conclusive,4, 5, researchers are feeling threatened by the current system. Health-care administrators have also voiced concern that the patent system limits access to biomedical advances.6, 7 Whatever the empirical data eventually demonstrate, there is an emerging crisis of confidence in the patent system that is in itself serious.",
