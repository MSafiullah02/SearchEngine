            "text": "Stress and burnout have been recognized as significant factors that influence medical trainees\u2019 aptitude [1], learning [2\u20135], professionalism [6\u20139], wellness [9\u201312], and care of patients [8, 9, 13]. Stress is a psychological and physical process that occurs when a person is faced with a demand that is perceived to exceed the resources available to respond to it effectively [14, 15]. Burnout is a state of mental and/or physical exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress, and can be measured through the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory [14\u201317]. A recent study reported that at least half of all medical students might be affected by stress and burnout during medical school [17]. Dyrbye and colleagues revealed that the learning environment was significantly associated with medical student burnout; specifically, students rotating on hospital wards and those required to stay for overnight call were more likely to experience burnout [18]. Psychological distress can lead to depression and thus medical students are at high risk [19\u201322]. Compared with US college graduates age 22\u201332, medical students were more likely to exhibit symptoms of depression and had higher levels of fatigue [23]. Even more alarming is the recent finding that the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among medical students was 27.2% and that of suicidal ideation was 11.1% [24]. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to the stress phenomenon during undergraduate medical education, including students\u2019 awareness of stress and how to improve students\u2019 stress coping skills. This is particularly important during the challenging transition from the mostly didactic-filled pre-clerkship curriculum to patient-care focused clerkships which requires medical students to adjust to new learning environments, unpredictable schedules, and different expectations.",

            "text": "Studies have investigated interventions for students to minimize the stress inherent to medical education and training and to improve wellness [25, 26]. Specifically, the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training on pre-clinical and clinical medical students have been shown to reduce depression [27, 28], anxiety [27], psychological distress [27, 29, 30], perceived stress [28, 31, 32], and emotional exhaustion [28] and to increase empathy [27], self-compassion [28, 31], mindfulness skills [28, 30], positive mental health [30], life satisfaction [30], and spirituality [27]. Medical students, however, use various coping mechanisms that vary by year in training and source of the stress [33]. The specific coping strategies that students use may determine the effect of stress on their academic performance and well-being [14]. However, little is understood regarding medical students\u2019 knowledge of the impact of stress on their own health, learning, and patient care. In addition, there is a paucity of literature on medical students\u2019 knowledge of coping strategies available and self-awareness of the need to utilize adapting coping strategies to prevent burnout and depression [9]. Given the significant prevalence of psychological distress, burnout, and depression among medical students, it is critical for medical schools to equip students with the knowledge necessary to recognize stress, ability to determine when to seek assistance, and capacity to manage stress effectively to promote well-being and prevent burnout [9, 34, 35]. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal survey study in medical students poised to initiate clinical clerkships in order to investigate the impact of a stress management workshop on knowledge and self-awareness of stress symptoms, impact of stress, and potential adaptive positive coping strategies.",

The standardized workshop format consisted of a 1 h didactic on stress and burnout with specific emphasis on manifestations in clinical medicine including definitions, epidemiology, time trends, hypothesized contributors, recognition in self and others, management, and approaches. In addition, the didactic highlighted the importance of seeking help and resources available to students. The second hour consisted of a panel discussion and small group breakouts on topics of role confusion, power in the hospital, benefits/risks of empathy, competition with colleagues, conflicts with other medical professionals/patients, dealing with disappointment, pimping, challenges of learning, self-care, handling stressful events, facade of perfection, and work/life balance, as well as recognizing and managing symptoms of burnout.

The Maslach Burnout Inventory evaluates three aspects of perceived burnout including emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment [37]. The Maslach Burnout Inventory is widely used to assess burnout in a variety of settings, and has been extensively validated as a tool to assess perceived burnout in medical professionals [38]. Research team members reviewed and reached agreement on the final questions and construct of the survey instruments. Cognitive pretesting was conducted with four medical students to ensure that students would interpret the survey questions in the intended manner. All survey instruments included identical questions to measure students\u2019 perceived changes in stress management in four domains: knowledge (impact of stress on their own health, learning, and patient care), confidence, perceived skills, and attitude (towards utilizing adaptive coping strategies to prevent burnout), which used a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely). Self-reported level of burnout (5-point Likert-type scale; 1 = completely burned out, 5 = no symptoms of burnout) was assessed in the pre- and long-term post-workshop surveys. Ten questions (4-point Likert-type scale; 1 = not at all, 4 = a lot) about workshop satisfaction and helpfulness were also included in the post-workshop survey.",

This finding may be identifying premorbid depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns; perhaps students who have already sought help in the past and are not opposed to reporting difficulty or seeking help in general. This highlights that it is critically important for students to know where to find resources should they need to seek help. Further, this finding may also reveal students who are empathetic and thus more likely to talk about their feelings and seek help. One theory is that a high level of empathy may cause \u201ccompassion fatigue\u201d which then leads to emotional exhaustion and burnout [39]. Future studies are needed to further investigate the relationship between empathy and burnout among medical students, including whether increased screening for burnout should be used in students who are more likely to ask for help.",
