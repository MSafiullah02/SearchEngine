These gonadotropins play a critical role in the development and maintenance of the gonads. LH stimulates production of progesterone by granulosa cells from large follicles40 and testosterone by Leydig cells of the testes.41 FSH increases proliferation of granulosa cells, expression of both steroidogenic acute regulator (StAR) and inhibin \u03b1 genes in granulosa cells and release of progesterone with the effect progressively greater with tissue from larger follicles.42, 43 In addition, prolactin can exert an inhibitory effect on the chicken ovary.44\n",

Moreover, the levels of calcium in diets are higher as the production cycle proceeds presumably due to the increasing size of the egg. This is the case irrespective of whether the recommendations are for layer or broiler breeder hens (Table 20.5).",

Most broiler breeder molt programs are achieved by restricting feed consumption and supplementing water containing essential micro-nutrients allowing utilization of fat stores. This reduced fat stores such that hens achieve a more pullet-like body composition before being photostimulated again. In addition to feed restriction, to induce molting in broiler breeder hens, the daylength is decreased to 8L:16D and light intensity is reduced.85, 86 Production levels with molted broiler breeders are about 10% less than their previous laying cycle.85, 86 The lower production level appears to be due to there being fewer follicles after a forced molt compared to their initial lay cycle.25\n",

Broodiness has been effectively genetically eliminated in commercial chickens irrespective of whether broilers or laying hens.104 Approaches that could reduce the unfavorable effects of broodiness in turkeys include: genetics and active or passive immunization with antisera reducing available prolactin. Administration of antisera to turkey prolactin increased egg production in turkeys.105 An alternate approach is active immunization. Similarly, egg production was markedly increased in turkey hens actively immunized against VIP (with VIP being conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin) due to impairment of prolactin release and consequently reduction in incubation behavior(s).106, 107 It was hoped that antisera could also enhance reproduction in males. Young male chickens exhibited multiple changes after active immunization against both inhibin and VIP. These included increases in semen volume and spermatozoa mobility together with spermatozoa concentrations.108 In contrast, this improvement in reproductive performance was not seen in old roosters actively immunized against both inhibin and VIP.109 Antibody approaches do not appear to be widely adopted due to expense of registration.",
