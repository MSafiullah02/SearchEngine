In spite of the various advancements made in the medical and research field, containment of this virus has proven to be difficult on several levels. As such, it is a necessary requirement to identify possible hotspots in the early stages of any disease. Based on previous studies carried out on coronaviruses, there is a high likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 may also survive in wastewater. Hence, we propose the use of nanofiber filters as a wastewater pre-treatment routine and up-gradation of existing wastewater evaluation and treatment system, to serve as a beneficial surveillance tool.",

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome Though coronavirus infection is primarily believed to occur by inhaling or coming in contact with aerosols [3] , viral RNA has also been detected in the stools of infected individuals with SARS and MERS [4] infection. There are reports of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the stool of infected individuals in the Netherlands, USA, France and Australia [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Another study by [10] showed potential evidence of the faecaloral transmission of SARS-CoV, and hence concerns have been raised regarding the spread of this virus through the water system. Water treatment systems play a significant role in public health protection. Treated wastewater has a wide range of uses from drinking, recreational purposes like a spa or an open pool for irrigation and food production [11] . With the potential for being part of the environmental transmission, a significant concern regarding the safety of drinking water, wastewater sanitation as well as the sewages was raised. In addition, the role of biofilms has also been questioned since it is possible for slimy bacteria that form a thin coat over the pipelines to aid in the spread of the virus [12] . This article discusses the current water management system and the benefits of installing a monitoring tool in wastewater treatment facilities.",

A study using SARS and poliovirus showed that the survival of the viruses decreased drastically when factors such as temperature, organic matter, light exposure, and aerobic microorganisms were unfavourable for the viruses under study. The use of detergents, solvents, and protozoa is also capable of inactivating viruses [17] . For the virus to infect a person through water, it is necessary to survive through the treatment process and retain its infectivity before coming in contact with a host, which is very unlikely [18] . Studies have shown that the rate of inactivation of SARS is faster than poliovirus, which indicates that enveloped viruses are unstable, and the mode of transmission through wastewater is unlikely [17] .",

Pre-treatment methods such as wet-oxidation, microwave, and ultrasonic waves can also be implemented before the effluent enters the treatment routine.

Monitoring tools have already been successfully implemented for viruses like poliovirus and Aichi virus [30] [31] , which have aided in strategies that resulted in their elimination. The efficiency of a monitoring tool depends on various factors such as geographical location, general sanitary, climatic conditions, sampling methods like trap sampling, precipitation methods, charge-based filters, and detection methods [34] .

            "text": "Although there is no concrete evidence of COVID-19 transmission through water systems, it is essential to study the survival rate of SARS-CoV-2 in surface wastewater and sewage water as a precaution. Since there are several cases of asymptomatic infections of COVID -19, it will be useful to identify the populations with these carriers to prevent further spread of this virus. The study by Gundy et al. [17] showed that SARS survives in wastewater for a limited time. The number of viruses present in the water is proportional to the number of infected individuals in the area. By constantly monitoring the levels of these viruses, it is possible to determine the spread of the COVID -19 infections. This tool will serve as an efficient and sensitive monitoring tool to measure virus levels in hotspot populations and provide early warning signs before a potential epidemic in the future. A major drawback of this tool is the lack of detection of enveloped viruses during the treatment process, the need for special laboratory skills as well as sustainable financial resources. It will be invaluable to develop direct detection methods like ELISAs, RT -PCR, digital RT -PCR, multiplex PCR, cDNA microarrays, Isothermal nucleic acid amplification-based methods, or the newly discovered paper-based device for coronaviruses in these wastewater treatment facilities [46] [47] [48] . Another aspect to be noted is sensitivity. The tools should be sensitive enough to capture even the smallest amount of viral infection during the initial stages to prevent the spread of viral particles.",

            "text": "One of the most effective monitoring tools to date is the use of electrospun nanofiber membranes to screen disease-causing pathogens. These nanofibers are effective in isolating pathogens using a polyurethane nanofiber material (147nm), which is active in filtering intestinal enterococci, E. coli, and coliform bacteria [49] . Characterization of the nanofiber membranes could be achieved by Fourier transform infrared spectrometers with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), scanning electron microscopy, surface area analysis, and contact angle measurements. The bioengineering of these nanofibers with specific binding sites increases the specificity towards its target, in this case, SARS-CoV-2 [49] . This pretreatment technique has proven effective in filtration. These flat sheet membranes are electrospun with a range of functionalizing agents such as nanosilver, bronopol and WSCP (Poly[(dimethylimino)(2-hydroxy-1,3-propanedily) chloride] based on the required pore size and colony-forming units of the microorganism. Although there is a high risk of losing functionality during leaching, the microorganism removal capacity of these nanofibers was shown to be preserved [50] . Hence, we propose that a custom-made, removable, electrospun nanofiber membrane with a positive charge could be effective in attracting the genetic material of a virus, making it a potential monitoring tool. This membrane, when lysed using standard protocols [50] , would give a higher yield of the genetic material when compared to isolation from a crude sample.",

Providing additional treatments to the wastewater before it enters the treatment routine, thus upgrading the existing process, is a well-conceived notion. Home-made treatments like boiling and large-scale processes like ultrafiltration, inactivation by ultraviolet irradiation, and chlorination are promising tactics that can be used to upgrade the treatment, especially in pandemic hotspots. An investigation of the spread of viruses through biofilms also needs to be better prepared for future situations. Once the countermeasures of social distancing are uplifted, and people return to their routine lifestyle, there is a high probability of the re-emergence of this virus. Hence, facilities like a monitoring tool for increased scrutiny of wastewater treatment industries must be enforced to minimize public health risks.",
