            "text": "Despite the attempts to improve patient outcomes by incorporating new active systemic agents into clinical practice, there has been little improvement in the metastatic CRC patient cure rate. In spite of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) use, with or without additional therapy, to eradicate metastatic disease after \u201ccurative\u201d surgery for CRC, most cancers relapse within the first few years following treatment completion. This suggests that there is a relatively rapid repopulation of neoplastic progeny, i.e., CRC stem cells [1,2]. A more aggressive treatment with higher or prolonged doses of multiple drug combinations, such as 5-FU and oxaliplatin, leads to serious side-effects [3,4]. Despite the frequent use of 5-FU in cancer, a thorough understanding of its mechanisms of action and interventions to overcome resistance are still relatively limited. One of mechanisms of resistance to 5-FU occurs through the induction of the EMT pathway [5,6]. The down-regulation of epithelial markers (APC, \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin) is characteristic to the EMT pathway EMT, which is involved in CRC stem cell invasion, metastasis and drug-resistance [[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]].",

            "text": "In an effort to develop a more effective drug that has a minimal side effect profile on normal epithelial cells in CRC treatment, we recently identified a novel tetraazaadamantane containing small molecule NSC30049 (1-(4-Chloro-2-butenyl)-1\u03bb\u223c5\u223c,3,5,7-tetraazatricyclo[3.3.1.1\u20133,7\u223c]decane) that either alone or in combination potentiates 5-FU-mediated growth inhibition of CRC heterogeneous bulk, FOLFOX-resistant and CRC stem cells while maintaining the integrity of the normal colonic epithelial cells [13]. Nitrogen containing adamantane analogs [14,15], e.g., 1-azaadamantanes, 1,3-diazaadamantanes, 1,3,5-triazaadamantanes and 1,3,5,7-tetraazaadamantanes are of great interest as conformationally constrained motifs for the design of various pharmacological tools [16]. Structural uniqueness of these azaadamantanes is related to both physical and chemical properties, most notably in the reduction of lipophilicity thus inducing higher aqueous solubility of these compounds compared to that of adamantanes consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms [14,15]. However, studies of the biological activity of azaadamantanes and their derivatives are still relatively less explored despite having good pharmacological properties. A few representative examples of 1-azaadamantane motif (Fig. 1\n) include 5-HT4 receptor agonist SC-54750 (1) [17], a modulator of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 2 [[18], [19], [20]], inhibitors of \u03c31 (CNS related diseases) and \u03c32 (cancer), inhibitors of human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1), and anti-viral and analgesic agents [[21], [22], [23]]. Furthermore, the natural product, ansabananin (ABN) (3) that inhibits SARS Coronavirus (SCV) [24], and other natural alkaloids dapholdamine B (4) [25], daphnezomines A (5) [26] possess 1-azaadamantane moiety (Fig. 1). Recently, a diazaadamantane derivative 6 has been reported as an inhibitor of the rimantadine-resistant strain of the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus [27]. It is noteworthy that although methenamine is clinically used to prevent urinary tract infections [28], the tetrazaadementane skeleton is barely utilized to design small drug-like molecules except in synthesizing the crucial reaction intermediate phenacyl amines [[29], [30], [31]]. NSC30049 (7a) is a unique tetraazaadamentane (methenamine) analog identified recently by our group that showed activity against 5-FU/oxaliplatin resistant and stem cells [13].",

Since Chk1 plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation in response to DNA damage, several Chk1 inhibitors have been developed and tested as chemo-sensitizing agents [[32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]]. Compound 7a has been shown to inhibit Chk1 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo CRC models [13]; however, the pharmacokinetic analysis showed a short plasma half-life similar to 5-FU [40]. The short plasma half-life of 7a is likely due to the presence of a reactive alkyl chloride group. To overcome this problem, we designed and synthesized several novel tetraazaadamantane 7a analogs, and tested their cytotoxic efficacy against CRC bulk, FOLFOX-resistant as well as CRC stem cells.",

The rationale is that reactive alkyl chloride can potentially react with protein thiols and amines to compromise its plasma half-life and thus the biological activity. The functionalities that replaced cholo (Cl) group were chosen to enhance the overall stability of the molecule while retaining or possibly enhancing the potency (Fig. 2\n). In addition, the approaches of modification also included saturation of the olefinic group, shortening of the alkyl chain length, and replacement of nitrogen (N-7) of tetraazaadmantane ring with phosphorus having more labile valence shell electrons (Fig. 2).",

Results showed a variable range of IC50 of these analogs. Based on the results of this cell viability assay, some structure-activity relationship (SAR) can be inferred: First, reducing the olefinic double bond by retaining chlorine atom (7g) reduced the potency of the compounds on cancer cell viability. Second, replacing the chlorine atom of 7a by a phenyl (ASR352, 7b) retained the activity of the molecule while the removal of the chlorine atom (7c) led to reduced potency (Table 1\n). Third, isosteric phosphorous analogs of 7a (i.e. 7d) and 7b (i.e. 7e) displayed only moderate cell viability when compared to its parent nitrogen analogs, while both 7c and its isosteric phosphorus analog 7h exhibited poor activity (Table 1). Compound 7h having a 3-phenyl boronic acid functionality also led to a reduced potency. Fourth, among the analogs designed by replacing chlorine atom of 7a with phenacyl groups of different alkyl chain lengths (11a-c), analogs having phenyl (ASR367, 11a, IC50 18.53 \u00b1 1.41 \u03bcM) and 4-methoxy phenyl (11b, IC50 13.10 \u00b1 0.16 \u03bcM) displayed moderate inhibition of cell viability, while 11c designed by extending the alkyl chain length of 11a lost the activity (Table 1). Overall, except replacement of Cl\u2212 group of 7a by a phenyl group, all other modifications in structure including chain length, functional group variation, or isosterically replacing nitrogen by phosphorous, caused a dramatic reduction in or the total loss of cytotoxicity against HCT116 cells (Table 1). Compounds 7d, 11a and 11b showed IC50 in the range of 13\u201318 \u03bcM; other analogs, such as 7c, 7e, 7f, 7h, 7g and 11c did not show any or very poor inhibitory activity against HCT116 cells (Table 1).",

The consequence of this leads to drug resistance and cell survival [47,48]. Therefore, current efforts are to induce death of the arrested cells by using inhibitors of the checkpoint kinases [[49], [50], [51]]. It was known that the therapeutic activity of 5-FU is linked to the replication stress as one of the mechanisms [52,53]. Several other inducers of the replication stress pathways have been implicated as therapeutic agents [51,[53], [54], [55], [56]]. By enhancing replicative stress through perturbing the S-G2/M checkpoints in cancer cells, a mitotic catastrophe can be induced with accumulated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks, that exceeds the repair capacity of the cell; and leads to cell death [[57], [58], [59]].",

The cell cycle analysis results showed 5-FU-induced S phase arrest of HCT116 cells (Fig. 3B). However, after combination treatment with 7a, while S phase arrest continued the G2/M phase arrest was abrogated. Interestingly, in combination with 5-FU, 7b abrogated the S phase and increased the G2/M phase arrest (Fig. 4\nB). The structural differences in 7a and 7b seem to be important for the differential activity of these two compounds on cell cycle profiling.",

Therefore, to impair DNA repair or cellular division, Chk1 (S317P) inhibitors as single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents may be important for further research. It is well-established that ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation at S317P and S345P plays a critical role in DNA replication, DNA repair, S-G2/M phase checkpoint control [62], and has been the target for cancer therapy [63], It has been also shown that the inhibition of Chk1(S317P) and Chk1(S296P) abrogates S-phase progression [64,65]. Since 7b abrogates S phase arrest, we determined the phosphorylation level of Chk1 after treatment with 7b either alone or in combination with HU, a pure inducer of S phase arrest [60,61]. The experimental protocol is described in Fig. 4A. Results showed a high level phosphorylation of Chk1(S317P), Chk1(S345P) and Chk1(S296P) after the treatment with HU (Fig. 5\ncompare lane 1 with 2)\u2019 which was reduced after combination treatment with 7b (Fig. 4, compare lane 2 with 4). However, treatment with 7b alone did not affect the phosphorylation of Chk1 (Fig. 4, compare lane 1 with 3). These results suggest that 7b blocks HU-induced Chk1 phosphorylation and thus is involved in the abrogation of S phase as seen in Fig. 4.",

ATR phosphorylates histone H2A variant H2AX at Ser139 to form \u03b3H2AX that is considered as a marker of DSBs [68,69]. Previously, it has been shown that the inhibition of Chk1 by gemcitabine and 5-FU treatments increases \u03b3H2AX levels through ATR-mediated replicative stress [66,68]. In the present study, we examined whether 7b-induced toxicity either alone or in combination with 5-FU, was related to DSBs and phosphorylation of \u03b3H2AX. We examined the levels of \u03b3H2AX by IHC staining. The cells treatment protocol is given in Fig. 6\nA. We observed an increased \u03b3H2AX-foci after treatment with 7b alone in HCT-116 cells that was further increased in combination with 5-FU (Fig. 7\nB). Thus, these results show that 7b either alone or in combination with 5-FU induces replication stress-mediated DNA damage in HCT-116 cells.",

For direct mechanism, we performed in vitro Chk1 kinase assay by using purified Chk1 protein. Results showed no inhibition of the Chk1 activity by any of these compounds (Table 4\n). Next, we tested whether any other kinases may be a target of these compounds. We profiled the activity of 366 kinases in an in vitro assay system but did not find a significant inhibition by 7a and 7b (see Table S1, Supplementary Material). From these results it became clear that the inhibition of Chk1 phosphorylation is not directly caused by 7a and 7b, but possibly due to some unknown mechanism(s) which remain to be elucidated.",

In our studies, the inhibition of Chk1 phosphorylation by 7a and 7b is caused only at Ser317 not at Ser345, indicating that ATR may not be a target of 7a and 7b. However, this possibility cannot be completely ruled out as the ATR was not included in our kinase profiling assays. It is also possible that Chk1 is indirectly inhibited by proteins, such as Claspin, that serves as a scaffold protein in ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation [72,73]. The down-regulation of Claspin expression have been shown to inhibit Chk1 activation in response to replication stress [74]. Studies are awaited to examine whether 7a- and 7b-mediated inhibition of Chk1 phosphorylation is due to down-regulation of Claspin. Furthermore, 7a and 7b might down-regulate mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, that in turn, may down-regulate Chk1 phosphorylation and induce \u03b3H2AX phosphorylation [75]. However, we have not yet experimentally verified the role of mTORC1 in 7a- and 7b-mediated inhibition of Chk1 phosphorylation.",

Thus, the increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio plays a critical role in determining the susceptibility to apoptosis in cancer cells. We determined the effect of 7a and 7b treatments on the expression of apoptotic marker proteins e.g. cleaved caspase 3 and PARAP 1 and then determined their correlation with Bax/Bcl2 ratio in FOLFOX-HT29 and FOLFOX-HCT116 cells.

According to Lipinski's rule, any compound with the molecular weight (MW) greater than 500 Da, hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) more than 10, hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) more than five, and an octanol-water partition coefficient (logP) value more than 5, is likely to have poor absorption or membrane permeation under physiological conditions. Similarly, Veber et al., based on their studies in rats, suggested that any compound with rotatable bonds \u226410 would have good oral availability [82]. A closer inspection of Table 5 shows that both 7a and 7b showed compliance with the Lipinski's as well as Veber indicators. The topological polar surface area (TPSA), which is an indicator for hydrogen bond forming capability of molecules, was also computationally predicted using the same tool in DS. More than 90% drugs targeting human proteins are reported to have PSA <140 \u00c52, hence considered to be an important indicator to predict the bioavailability of drug candidates after oral absorption. Both 7a and 7b with TPSA around 10 \u00c52 exhibited compliance with TPSA indicator (Table 5), again suggesting their potential to be developed as drug molecules.",

Briefly, 1500 cells were plated in quadruplets in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates. After treatment with compounds for certain periods as described in respective figure legends, 10 \u03bcl of MTT reagent was added to each well and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h to allow the formation of purple color crystals of formazan. In total, 100 \u03bcl of detergent solution was added to each well, and the reaction mixture was incubated in dark for 2\u20134 h at room temperature. The developed color density was then measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm using the POLARstar Omega micro-plate reader (BMG Labtech, Inc., Cary, NC).",
