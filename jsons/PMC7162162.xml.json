            "text": "Enveloped RNA viruses replicate and assemble in association with cellular membranes, often in a complex structure, a \u2018viral factory\u2019, to which the participating cell and viral factors are recruited. Mitochondria, cytoskeletal elements and cellular endomembranes are frequent participants in the factory architecture. Knowledge about the signals involved in organelle recruitment and modification, as well as mechanisms operating in spatial connection between viral replication and morphogenesis, is very limited. One of the earliest events in the construction of the factory is the formation of the replication complexes (RCs). In this sense, the replication of viral genomes in association with intracellular membranes is a common feature of many viruses, particularly of positive\u2010stranded RNA viruses (Salonen et al., 2005). A variety of membranes are used by different viruses, including membranes of secretory pathway organelles (picorna\u2010, arteri\u2010, bromo\u2010 and flaviviruses) (Schlegel et al., 1996; van der Meer et al., 1998; Mackenzie et al., 1999; Suhy et al., 2000; Dubuisson et al., 2002; Westaway et al., 2002), mitochondria (nodaviruses) (Miller et al., 2001), peroxisomes and chloroplasts (tombusviruses) (Rochon, 1999), endosomes and lysosomes (togaviruses) (Froshauer et al., 1988; Lee et al., 1994; Magliano et al., 1998; Kujala et al., 2001) and autophagosomes (arteriviruses, coronaviruses, poliovirus and rhinovirus) (reviewed by Wileman, 2006). It appears that targeting to the specific organelle is mediated by viral replicase components (Salonen et al., 2003; 2005).",

            "text": "A very unique feature of togaviruses is that their RCs assemble in modified organelles of endo\u2010lysosomal origin that have been termed \u2018cytopathic vacuoles\u2019 or CPVs (Froshauer et al., 1988; Lee et al., 1994; Magliano et al., 1998). CPVs contain internalized, membrane\u2010bound spherules of 50\u201370 nm which are thought to be the sites of viral RNA synthesis. In some electron micrographs, these spherules appear to be connected with the organelle membrane by slender threads or \u2018necks\u2019. It is probably through these necks that newly synthesized RNA is transported to the cytoplasm. While the two togavirus genera, alphaviruses (e.g. Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus) and rubiviruses (rubella virus, RUB), generate CPVs with a similar morphology and have rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) cisternae and mitochondria around, Golgi stacks are additionally recruited to RUB CPVs (Lee et al., 1992; Magliano et al., 1998; Risco et al., 2003) forming a \u2018viral factory\u2019 where the virus replicates, assembles and matures (Lee and Bowden, 2000; Novoa et al., 2005a).",

            "text": "The study of intracellular RUB infection has been hampered by the slow rate of virus replication and lack of synchronous infection in culture cells. The RUB genome is a single\u2010stranded RNA of plus\u2010polarity of \u223c10 kb in length that contain two open reading frames (ORF), a 5\u2032 proximal ORF (the NS\u2010ORF) that encodes the two non\u2010structural replicase components, P150 and P90, and is translated from the genome RNA and a 3\u2032 proximal ORF (the SP\u2010ORF) that encodes the virion structural proteins, capsid (C) and envelope glycoproteins E2 and E1 and is translated from a subgenomic RNA synthesized in infected cells (Frey, 1994). Replicons which substitute reporter genes for the SP\u2010ORF have been developed and used to study replication in the absence of the virion proteins (Tzeng et al., 2001). Recently, genomic and replicon constructs have been generated which express an additional gene under control of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (Pugachev et al., 2000). When the additional gene is an antibiotic resistance gene, populations of stably transfected cells that uniformly harbour the replicon can be selected (Chen and Icenogle, 2004) enhancing the ability to study intracellular replication events.",

Although it is not required for RNA synthesis, the virus C protein has recently been shown to both enhance and modulate virus RNA synthesis (Tzeng and Frey, 2005; Tzeng et al., 2006) and rescue a variety of deleterious viral mutants, an effect manifested at the level of RNA synthesis (Tzeng and Frey, 2003; Chen and Icenogle, 2004; Tzeng et al., 2006). Furthermore, the C protein binds to a mitochondrial protein, P32, and has been reported to alter the cellular distribution of mitochondria (Beatch et al., 2005). Therefore, it was of interest to study the effect of expression of the C protein on RCs in replicon\u2010transfected cells. For EM, specimens were prepared by freeze substitution, allowing for superior structural preservation, prior to embedding and sectioning. This is the first study of togaviruses RCs and CPVs in which freeze substitution has been employed for sample preparation and differences in CPV morphology were noted, included discovery of a novel CPV architecture in replicon\u2010transfected cells that is also present in CPVs assembled in virus infected cells.",

The former construct was termed RUBrep/GFP/neo and the latter was termed RUBrep/C\u2010GFP/neo. Confocal microscopy of Vero and BHK\u201021 cells transfected transiently (2\u20134 days post transfection with no drug selection) revealed that P150 (Fig. 1B) and P90 (not shown), the two replicase components, localize in organelles labelled with antibodies against the lysosomal marker LAMP\u20101, GFP localizes in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B and C) while the C\u2010GFP fusion localizes in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D and E), the site of accumulation of C protein in RUB\u2010infected cells. Double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA), an intermediate of RNA replication, also localized with lysosomes (Fig. 1C and D), but interestingly was also sometimes on the cell periphery as well, either in association with lysosomes or without apparent association with lysosomes (Fig. 1E). Many cells exhibited both patterns of dsRNA distribution, depending on the plane of the micrograph within the cell (Fig. 1F and G). Similar findings were made with stably transfected cell cultures obtained following drug selection (not shown). Replicons thus assemble RCs in association with lysosomes, similarly to virus\u2010infected cells.",

No significant alterations in the global distribution of lysosomes, Golgi or mitochondria were observed between control and transfected cells.

Colocalized C\u2010GFP and replicase occasionally exhibited a filamentous pattern reminiscent of cytoskeletal architecture (Fig. 3D).

Two views of CPVs in RUBrep/C\u2010GFP/neo stably transfected cells are shown in Fig. 4A and B which likely represent a cross\u2010section and a side view respectively. The CPV in Fig. 4A is electron\u2010dense and contains a number of hollow vacuoles while the CPVs in Fig. 4B are characterized by a large vacuole and a long straight element. CPVs in RUBrep/GFP/neo stably transfected cells had a similar morphology (not shown). As a control for the replicon\u2010transfected cells, uninfected and RUB\u2010infected BHK\u201021 cells (24 and 48 h post infection) were similarly analysed (Fig. 4C and D). Lysosomes in uninfected cells (inset in Fig. 4D) were electron\u2010dense with some small vesicles occasionally distinguishable (but at a much lower number than in CPVs in replicon\u2010transfected cells) and usually devoid of vacuoles and straight elements and without local recruitment of mitochondria and RER (not shown). However, RUB\u2010infected cells (Fig. 4C and D) contained electron\u2010dense CPVs with internal vacuoles and straight elements, although these were usually smaller and in lower abundance than in replicon stably transfected cells. Immunogold labelling with antibodies against P150 and P90 replicase components (Fig. 5) demonstrated the presence of both proteins in CPVs, which were also labelled by anti\u2010lysosome antibodies (not shown). Thus, these CPVs contain RUB replicon RCs. Both P150 and P90 were associated with both vacuoles and straight elements in the CPVs. Side views of CPVs suggest that straight elements and their replicase proteins are in contact with the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B and C). To study if RNA replication takes place on the cytosolic or on the lumenal side of the CPVs, transfected cells were treated with streptolysin\u2010O (SLO) to open pores in the plasma membrane without altering intracellular membranes before immunolabelling with anti\u2010dsRNA antibodies (Fig. 5E\u2013G). Saponin, which permeabilizes all endomembranes, was used in some of the samples as a control. Labelling of the cytosolic domain of TGN38 and the mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp\u201060 (not shown) served as controls for the permeabilization procedures and confirmed the topological interpretation of dsRNA localization. After saponin treatment an intense signal associated to dsRNA is observed as shown in Fig. 5D. After SLO treatment and immunolabelling before fixation, similar dsRNA signals were obtained but only in permeabilized cells, where free cytosolic GFP has been released (Fig. 5F and G). These results indicate that RNA replication is taking place on the cytoplasmic side of CPVs.",

It is thought that these complex structures are built by viruses to concentrate key components and increase the efficiency of replication and assembly of new viral particles (Novoa et al., 2005b; Wileman, 2006). Modified organelles that are specifically labelled for lysosomal markers are the central elements of RUB factories, and RER cisternae, mitochondria and Golgi stacks are among the recruited cellular factors. The architecture of the RCs inside the modified lysosome or CPV and the mechanism of transfer of replicated genomes to the assembly sites in Golgi membranes remain to be elucidated. Towards this end, in this study we investigated RCs in cells transfected with RUB replicons. With replicons, the contribution of the structural proteins can be dissected from the non\u2010structural replicase proteins. Additionally, as the replicons used expressed a GFP reporter gene and an antibiotic resistance gene, transfected cells could be readily identified and drug selection could be used to select a population of cells that uniformly harboured the replicon. We found CPVs in replicon\u2010transfected cells that were modified lysosomes similar in structure to those found in RUB\u2010infected cells, although they were present in greater abundance and appeared to have a more developed internal architecture of vacuoles and membrane\u2010bound straight elements. These elements were also present in a small percentage of lysosomes in control cells and thus the generation of these structures in CPVs may be a normal process stimulated by virus/replicon replication. Interestingly, viral replicase proteins reach the same intracellular location during infection and transfection. The use of replicons is then a valuable strategy to study these early interactions that trigger the formation of the RUB factory and the beginning of viral genome replication in cell membranes.",

Some viruses replicate in autophagosomes (Jackson et al., 2005; Wileman, 2006), that are double\u2010membrane vacuoles where cytosol and organelles are sequestered and delivered to lysosomes (Klionsky, 2005). However, when treating cells transfected with RUB replicons with 3\u2010methyl\u2010adenine, a specific inhibitor of early stages of the autophagic process (Seglen and Gordon, 1982) no decrease in dsRNA signal was observed (not shown). Viruses that use the autophagic machinery induce an increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles and consequently in the signal provided by monodansyl\u2010cadaverine (MDC), a fluorophore specific for autophagic vacuoles under certain fixation conditions (Jackson et al., 2005). However, in cells transfected with RUB replicons there was no increase in the number of autophagosomes as observed after incubation with MDC (not shown) while Lysotracker signal colocalized with the CPVs (Fig. 3C). These data would suggest that CPVs are not related to autophagosomes but with modified lysosomes as reported (Magliano et al., 1998). However, a detailed study should be done at very short times post transfection to study if autophagy is induced by the virus at the very beginning of the life cycle.",

Similar observations have been made in RUB\u2010infected cells (reviewed in Lee and Bowden, 2000). As lysosome modification to generate CPVs and organelle recruitment was observed with replicons lacking the C protein, the non\u2010structural replicase proteins by themselves can carry out these functions. Although local organelle recruitment was observed, global organelle recruitment in replicon\u2010transfected cells was not, independently of whether the replicon expressed the C protein or not. Beatch et al. (2005) recently reported a global recruitment of mitochondria to perinuclear regions in cells expressing the RUB C protein. However, as such a global recruitment is not observed in RUB replicon\u2010transfected cells, this observation appears to be specific for expression of the C protein alone. Although expression of the C protein by replicons was not necessary for generation of CPVs, in cells transfected with replicons expressing the C protein, colocalization of the C protein with P150 and P90 was detected and the C protein accumulated on the exterior of CPVs. Small amounts of C were also detected inside CPVs. Confocal microscopy suggested that C covered the exterior of some modified lysosomes. The replicon expressed C protein is actually a fusion protein with GFP and we cannot rule out a different behaviour of C\u2010GFP when compared with C alone. However, C\u2010GFP fusions are functional in modulation of replicon RNA synthesis and mutant rescue (Tzeng and Frey, 2003; 2005) and Lee et al. (1999) detected C protein around CPVs by immuno\u2010EM of RUB\u2010infected cells (Lee et al., 1999). With regard to C\u2010mediated enhancement and modulation of replicon RNA synthesis and mutant rescue, it was recently found that P150 and C can be co\u2010immunoprecipitated (Tzeng et al., 2006) and our finding of colocalization of C, P150 and P90 further confirms an interaction, which may play a role in these C\u2010mediated phenomena. Colocalization of C with P150 was previously reported in RUB\u2010infected cells (Kujala et al., 1999).",

(1999) also observed the colocalization of P150 with actin and a considerable disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in RUB\u2010infected cells. It is known that viruses frequently use actin filaments for intracellular transport while some viruses disrupt the actin cytoskeleton to facilitate infection (Cudmore et al., 1997; Dohner and Sodeik, 2005). Actin could also be a structural component of herpesviruses (Gr\u00fcnewald et al., 2003) and the participation of actin in organizing the sites of mRNA accumulation and synthesis of viral structural proteins has been reported for HIV (Kimura et al., 1996). The potential role of actin in RUB replication remains to be established. We also detected small amounts of the mitochondrial P32 protein in modified lysosomes and, conversely, C located on the exterior surface of mitochondria. The association of C and P32 was reported by two groups (Beatch and Hobman, 2000; Mohan et al., 2002) and Beatch and Hobman (2000) demonstrated that C and P32 interacted on the periphery of mitochondria in transfected cells expressing C protein. The function of this interaction in RUB replication has not been elucidated although Beatch et al. (2005) recently reported that mutations in the C protein that disrupt the interaction adversely affect virus infectivity. Our results confirm the localization of C to the exterior of mitochondria and are the first demonstration of P32 associated to RUB CPVs. We cannot discard that the presence of P32 inside CPVs could be due to autophagy. However, as P32 is able to leave the mitochondria (Matthews and Russell, 1998; Brokstad et al., 2001) its presence inside CPVs could have a different meaning. It has been proposed that RUB C could interact with P32 shortly before it is translocated into mitochondria or alternatively as it leaves it (Beatch et al., 2005). On the other hand, our results indicate that C protein would not be necessary for P32 association with RUB RCs because P32 is detected in CPVs when cells are transfected with RUBrep/GFP/neo. These data suggest that P32 could be a structural component of the RUB RC and it is tempting to speculate that P32 could participate in directing C protein to the RC for packaging of the newly synthesized RNA before virus assembly. Further studies will be necessary to clarify these key aspects of RUB replication.",

It has been previously reported that both alphaviruses and RUB RCs are secreted by infected cells at extended times post infection (Froshauer et al., 1988; Lee and Bowden, 2000). It is known that an increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ above 1 \u03bcM induces secretion of conventional lysosomes in many cell types (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 1997; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2000). This mechanism could be upregulated in infected/transfected cells. dsRNA detected on the cell surface could be actually contained in CPVs from which specific markers had disappeared on the way to the plasma membrane. This may be a mechanism for cells ridding themselves of virus\u2010specific dsRNA.",

Although size, shape and organelle association are similar, CPVs in RUB\u2010infected cells described in previous studies (Lee et al., 1994; Magliano et al., 1998; Lee and Bowden, 2000) generally appeared empty. However, the electron density of the CPVs in this study was consistent with the electron density of lysosomes in control cells and the difference is likely due to fixation techniques employed because we used conventional processing with very short dehydration steps or freeze substitution, both of which have been shown to yield superior structural preservation (Risco and Carrascosa, 1999). The filled vesicles we observe likely correspond to the spherules in the CPVs in RUB\u2010infected cells described in previous studies while the large vacuoles and straight elements were absent in CPVs described in these previous studies. In addition to differences in processing, it is also possible that we could have visualized stages in the biogenesis of the CPVs that were missed in these earlier studies.",

            "text": "The straight elements frequently observed inside CPVs in replicon\u2010transfected cells were particularly striking. Their rigidity suggested a high protein content and immunolabelling demonstrated that both replicase components were particularly abundant in these membranes while dsRNA and C, while detected, were present in lower amounts. Sectioning along the plane of the membrane revealed an apparent two\u2010dimensional proteinaceous sheet. The potential formation of 2D arrays of viral polymerases has been previously proposed in studies with poliovirus using in vitro transcription assays (Hobson et al., 2001; Lyle et al., 2002) but to our knowledge this has not been previously observed in infected cells. The participation of such arrays in virus or replicon RNA synthesis remains to be established, although the presence of dsRNA indicates that they are active. The availability of drug\u2010selected, uniformly transfected cell lines will allow us to further explore the structure of RUB RCs in CPVs at the molecular level by 3D reconstruction based on serial sectioning and electron tomography.",

E. coli JM109 and DH5\u03b1 were used as the bacterial hosts. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA) or Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN) and used as recommended by the manufacturer. To generate the RUBrep/GFP/Neo and RUBrep/C\u2010GFP/Neo constructs, a SpeI site was first introduced between the IRES and SP\u2010ORF in siRobo402 (Pugachev et al., 2000). This intermediate construct, termed siRobo402\u2010SpeI, was generated by a three\u2010round asymmetric PCR followed by a three\u2010fragment ligation (Tzeng and Frey, 2002). In the first round of PCR amplification, mutagenic oligo 937 (5\u2032\u2010GCTTGCCACAACCACTAGTATGGCTTCTACTAC\u20103\u2032; SpeI site underlined) was used to prime an asymmetric amplification on a PstI\u2010linearized siRobo402 template.

The amplified gene was restricted with SpeI and StuI and cloned into siRobo402\u2010SpeI, creating siRobo402\u2010Neo. To generate RUBrep/GFP/Neo and RUBrep/C\u2010GFP/Neo, an NsiI\u2010EcoRI fragment was removed in siRobo402\u2010Neo and was used to replace the corresponding fragments in RUBrep/GFP and RUBrep/C\u2010GFP (Tzeng and Frey, 2002; 2003) respectively.",
