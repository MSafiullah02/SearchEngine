All 8 acute care hospitals in Sa Kaeo (beginning in September 2003) and all 12 hospitals in Nakhon Phanom (beginning in January 2005) participated. Eligible patients included persons admitted to these hospitals with ARI, defined as evidence of active infection (body temperature <35.5\u00b0C or >38.2\u00b0C documented within 24 hours after admission, history of fever or chills, or abnormal white blood cell count or differential) and documented respiratory tract illness (abnormal breath sounds during physical examination or presence of tachypnea, cough, sputum production, or dyspnea). After enrollment, blood, urine, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected by study nurses. During 2003\u20132005, a second blood specimen was collected 3 weeks after enrollment for serologic testing. Leftover serum specimens were stored at \u221270\u00b0C at the Thailand National Institute of Health (Thai-NIH) for future testing.",

Some respiratory signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea and sputum production, were different between patients with versus without cryptococcal antigenemia; however, these characteristics are subjective and, on an individual level, unlikely to be useful diagnostically. Total white blood cell counts, which were significantly lower among antigenemic than nonantigenemic patients, were not different when patients with evidence of CM were excluded from the antigenemic group. This suggests that antigenemic patients with CM had more advanced HIV infection than did antigenemic patients without CM.

A high proportion (43%) of all CrAg+ patients had no evidence of any CM nor any detectable coinfections, suggesting that Cryptococcus species were a possible etiologic agent of their respiratory illness. Cryptococcal antigenemia, particularly at high titers, has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for future CM and a prognostic factor increasing the risk of death in certain populations [29]. Meya et al [16] demonstrated that asymptomatic antigenemic patients who are given fluconazole have improved survival over asymptomatic antigenemic patients who are not given fluconazole. For CrAg+ patients without overt signs and symptoms of cryptococcal infection, a window of opportunity for treatment might have existed to administer amphotericin B or high-dose fluconazole to reduce their risk of developing CM [7, 16, 22, 29\u221231]. Blood culture positive for Cryptococcus, as shown in our study, was associated with CrAg+ among patients in whom a clinical suspicion of CM already existed but was less frequent among patients without symptoms of CM. These data strongly point to a role for cryptococcal antigen testing among HIV-infected patients hospitalized with acute respiratory infection in Thailand. A highly sensitive and specific point-of-care test, such as the lateral flow assay recently described by Lindsley et al [32], could facilitate such rapid testing in this population.",

First, patient medical records were available for only a subset of patients, who might not be representative of the overall patient population. In addition, few follow-up data were available, which inhibited our ability to monitor the development of CM and survival among CrAg+ patients without evidence of meningitis. Second, our study was performed in rural areas of Thailand; because most HIV-infected patients in Thailand live in Bangkok, where exposures (such as to Cryptococcus species) of HIV-infected patients might differ from exposures in rural areas, the results might not be generalizable to the entire population. Third, P. jirovecii, a well-known fungal agent of pneumonia in HIV-infected patients in Southeast Asia [34, 35], was not included in the diagnostic testing for the pneumonia etiology study. Although few of the patients with medical records were found to have discharge diagnoses of P. jirovecii pneumonia, we cannot rule out the presence of this agent in these or other patients as a cause of their respiratory symptoms. Finally, we did not attempt to detect Cryptococcus species from lung tissue or respiratory specimens from patients enrolled in this study and, thus, cannot demonstrate conclusively that it was the cause of ARI in these patients. However, antigenemia indicates active infection, and many patients did not have other etiologic agents identified, despite testing for multiple common pathogens. Even without definitive evidence of a causal link with ARI, the high prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia in hospitalized HIV-infected patients with ARI in Thailand supports testing this population, regardless of signs and symptoms of meningitis.",
