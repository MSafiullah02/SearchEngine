Recent reports suggest that ACE2, which is the target protein to invade the host, has a ubiquitous presence in human organs, including lung parenchyma, gastrointestinal tract, nasal mucosa, renal and urinary tract, airway epithelia, lymphoid tissues, reproductive organs, vascular endothelium and neurons. In this scenario, neurologists are particularly involved into considering even more specific therapeutic strategies according to the available data during the pandemic. In particular, MS patients are usually receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) with immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory effects, which increase the risk of infections and morbidity, compared with the general population. Development of PML or other serious opportunistic infections during treatment with natalizumab forces to consider whether de-risking strategies are needed in this particular context and how to manage a high-efficacy treatment.",

EID has been suggested to reduce significantly PML risk compared to SID (4).

            "text": "infection of vascular endothelium or macrophages. Many factors have drawn the attention of neurologists: a significant number of cases of altered mental status and other neurological symptoms like anosmia and ageusia (2). The first report of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), a rare complication of influenza and other viral infections, in a COVID positive female patient, has increased even more the alert in the neurological community (3). This issue sounds relevant in particular for patients treated with immunosuppressant drugs. In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), prolonged treatment with natalizumab can reduce immune surveillance in the CNS, increasing the risk that poliomavirus JC could establish a lytic infection in oligodendrocytes, leading to Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). To limit the onset of this peculiar adverse event we adopted strategies to mitigate the risk, such as dosing of natalizumab in a less frequent range (extended interval dosing-EID) of 6-8 weeks, differently from the approved treatment schedule of every 4 weeks (standard interval dosing-SID) (4). We report a case of COVID-19 in a patient with MS treated with the monoclonal antibody natalizumab (humanized anti-VLA4), a 28-year old Caucasian health worker male (118 emergency ambulance driver). He received the diagnosis in the year 2000, when he developed acute upper and lower limb hyposthenia on the left side. Nothing relevant appears in his past medical history. He was previously treated with dimethyl fumarate and has always tested JCV-negative. At the end of February 2020, he underwent his 14th infusion in an EID regimen at 6 weeks. Routine haematological screening resulted in normal peripheral blood lymphocyte count; renal and hepatic function parameters were in the normal range. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) was 1.5. On March 11 he developed a fever (38,6\u00b0C), no other symptoms. PCR on nasal swab resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two consecutive samples. He was admitted to Spallanzani Hospital in Rome on March 19, due to persistent high fever and the emergence of dyspnoea. Chest CT showed mild bilateral interstitial pneumonia with ground glass opacities and arterial blood gas test showed normal blood oxygenation. Patient was treated with antipyretics, hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics, with resolution of symptoms within 10 days. He was discharged home on the 1 st of April after double-negative swabs. Patient returned to our hospital for treatment infusion at 7 weeks, still in the window of the EID. Blood exams showed normal leucocyte and lymphocyte count (5.68\u00d710^9 cells/L, range 4.00-10.00 and 2.17\u00d710^9 cells/L, range 1.00-4.50, respectively), with normal C-reactive protein (0,4 mg/L, range 0-5) and a slight increase of fibrinogen (467 mg/dl, range 150-450). At 2 weeks from the last administration, the patient is still at home due to the institutional lockdown, without the onset of any new symptoms or worsening of previous clinical conditions. Most notably, he hasn't developed any respiratory symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a natalizumab treated patient developing COVID-19, recovered and then retreated, without short-term complications.",
