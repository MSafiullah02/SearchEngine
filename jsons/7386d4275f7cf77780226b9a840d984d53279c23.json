Concurrent antibodies may neutralize the agent, or only noninfectious RNA or DNA remnants of the agent may be present. Proven transmission of the agent by blood components does not equate with disease in the recipient.

Sometimes the true costs and benefits of a safety measure only become clear years after its introduction. For example, universal leukodepletion of blood donations was hoped to reduce the risk of transmission of the vCJD agent. The filters involved were expensive. The efficacy of prion protein removal by leukodepletion is based on indirect evidence, obtained using laboratory animals which only partially reflect human blood donors incubating vCJD. Years later, leukodepletion filters have become very cheap; they virtually remove the risk of CMV, EBV, and HTLV transmission; they reduce transfusion reactions and alloimmunization; and it still is expected that they reduce the risk of vCJD transmission. All in all, leukodepletion turned out to be very effective but in unexpected ways. On the other side of the spectrum is the donor screening for HIV RNA in countries with a low incidence of HIV infection. Introduction of universal HIV RNA donor screening was considered to be indispensable for the societal trust in blood transfusion. However, in countries with a low incidence of HIV infection, \"HIV NAT only\" donations may not be encountered. Based on carefully collected data and using advanced modeling, Borkent and colleagues calculated that triplex-NAT donor screening for HIV, HCV, and HBV, on pools of six donations, costs Euro 5,200,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the Netherlands [14] . For this exercise, detailed characteristics of blood transfusion, recipients, and local HBV, HCV, and HIV epidemiology were taken into account.",

Reliable and detailed quantitative analysis of the impact of a transfusion-transmitted infection, including the costs and yield of mitigating measures, needs a team of specialists and considerable time. Figure 2 .1 illustrates the complexity of only one aspect of this matter. Considering the impact of a transfusion-transmitted infection in terms of lost years of life and chronic sequelae, the a priori life expectancy of the exposed recipients varies considerably [17] . Figure 2 .1 shows that platelets often are transfused to persons with (potential) long life expectancy, including young adults, children, and neonates at the far left of the graph, while Fig. 2.1 shows that the majority of fresh frozen plasma units was administered to patients with short life expectancies. Considering an emerging transfusion-transmitted threat, it appears that especially the administration of infectious platelets may have considerable consequences.",

            "text": "Remarkable details have been reported about the complex relation between infectivity of donated material and the detection of West Nile virus RNA in blood and organ donors [18] . In 54 blood donors, WNV RNA no longer was detectable in plasma 3 weeks after the donation that tested positive for WNV RNA. However, in 42% of the donors, WNV RNA remained detectable in whole blood up to 3 months after the index donation. In this phase, WNV is bound to erythrocytes, but -except for one case -blood components of the donors involved are not infectious for the recipients, probably due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies [18] . In contrast, organs from two donors in the later phase of infection (both testing positive for WNV IgG antibodies; one testing positive for WNV RNA in serum, one negative) caused WNV infection in their recipients [19] . Blood donors may silently harbor acute parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection. After acute infection, decreasing levels of parvovirus DNA are detectable during months to years. Once the parvovirus DNA level drops below 100,000 IU/mL (ref. 20) or 10,000 IU/mL [21] , donors do not transmit B19V to their recipients, which is attributed to concurrent neutralizing antibodies or to a noninfectious amount of transfused virions. However, recently, an alternative explanation was reported [22] . Studying ten donors up to 22 months after acute asymptomatic B19V infection, viral DNA remained detectable for more than 1 year. After 150 days post-infection, the B19V DNA of the donors became degradable by endonucleases, indicating that this concerned naked DNA, not the protected, encapsidated DNA as present in intact B19V virions. Hence, potentially infectious B19V viremia is only present during the first months of a much longer episode of B19V \"DNA-emia\" as detected by PCR.",

            "text": "Considering the assessment of blood-borne threats to public health, possibly the most difficult task is to estimate the remaining threat of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), as posed by blood donors with possible subclinical vCJD infection. As reviewed by Seed and colleagues, several studies indicate that the classic, sporadic form of CJD is no threat to the safety of transfusion, but three fatal cases of vCJD and one subclinical infection have been attributed to transmission via blood transfusion [23] . Since the outbreak of mad cow disease (BSE) in Great Britain, with subsequent cases of vCJD in humans, many blood banks maintain safety measures to prevent transmission of vCJD via blood transfusion and blood products. Examples of safety measures are the exclusion of blood donors who stayed at least 6 months in the UK during 1980-1996 and the exclusion of donors who themselves were transfused. Is it time to lift these restrictions? Until recently it seemed that the outbreak of vCJD had ended. Unfortunately in 2016 a new vCJD patient was reported. This patient was found to be heterozygous (methionine/ valine) for codon 129 of the human prion gene. This is alarming, because so far all vCJD patients were methionine homozygous ( Fig. 2.2, lower panel) . Possibly this first heterozygous patient reflects the start of a second wave of vCJD cases, with longer incubation times than the former homozygous cases. Apparently, people may harbor the infection during many years and, regarding blood banking, could be seen as asymptomatic but possibly infectious carriers. Studies of archived appendices suggest that indeed roughly 1 in 2500 British appendices tests positive for the vCJD agent. The first and second appendix studies involved 12,674 resp. 32,441 appendices, from persons born between 1961 and 1985 resp. 1941-1985 [24, 25] ; see the two middle panels in Fig. 2. 2. These persons experienced dietary exposure to the vCJD agent around 1990; and their appendices were removed in 1995-1999 resp. 2000-2012; in which 3 resp. 16 vCJD-prion-positive appendices were found. Is this finding really linked to dietary exposure to the vCJD agent in the 1980s and 1990s, or is there an unrelated, harmless, and natural background presence of the protein in appendices? The Appendix-III study included appendices and persons who did not live in the late 1980s and early 1990s [26] . The upper panel in Fig. 2.2 shows the confusing findings of the Appendix-III study: is the period of dietary exposure larger than assumed? Or is there no connection to the BSE/vCJD outbreak? Currently it seems wise not to abandon vCJD blood safety measures yet.",

A blueprint for a qualitative inventory and a report, describing the relevant characteristics of the emerging agent, is offered in tables 2.1 and 2.2. 2. Two more sophisticated, \"off the shelf\" methods for the quantitative analysis of a threat to blood safety, the Biggerstaff-Petersen model and the European Up-Front Risk Assessment Tool (EUFRAT), are described. The output of the Biggerstaff-Petersen model is the number of potentially infectious donations, while EUFRAT additionally takes into account the components prepared from donations and the efficacy of mitigating interventions such as donor screening and pathogen inactivation, enabling an estimation of the consequences for recipients. 3. Examples of sophisticated quantitative studies of specific agents are mentioned:",

Sometimes an additional detailed costbenefit analysis is needed. Only the implementation of partial or universal donor screening may generate sufficient data to precisely calculate the impact of the agent, facilitating the decision whether donor screening indeed is useful (in hindsight). In real-life blood banking, once safety measures have been implemented, it often is hard to stop them, even when the cost-benefit ratio is found to be very poor. Therefore, when a new threat arises, it must be considered to start donor screening only for a limited period [27] . This serves two purposes: it helps to prevent transmissions in an uncertain situation and maintains the public trust in blood transfusion, and it generates valuable data. When the period of temporary donor screening has ended, it can only be extended by an active decision to do so, based on the analysis of data that have become available in the meantime. This approach prevents the accumulation of inefficient preventive blood safety measures over time.",
