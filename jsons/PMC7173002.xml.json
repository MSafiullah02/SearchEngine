            "text": "FLUV are continuously evolving through amino acid substitutions altering antigenic properties (antigenic drift) or, less frequently, by segment reassortment events (antigenic shift) [7]. Some amino acid substitutions in the HA receptor binding site (RBS) can alter the cellular host tropism, conditioning the species range and tissue tropism, which may be also related to viral virulence [8]. The high mutation rate of the NA protein can also affect the antiviral susceptibility to currently available neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) drugs [9]. In addition, changes in the antigenic features of FLUAV or FLUBV, mainly in HA, explain the occurrence of seasonal influenza epidemics and are the reason for the annual vaccine composition update needed for a more effective prevention of disease and the related complications in high-risk patients [10]. Vaccination is the most effective public health action for preventing influenza. A higher vaccination enhances the achievement of community immunisation [11]. In Catalonia, the influenza vaccination is recommended to individuals over 60 years of age, especially those living in nursing homes, children over 6 months of age and adults with high risk comorbidities for clinical complications due to influenza infection, such as pregnancy or chronic diseases. It is also recommended to healthcare professionals and people working for public services (police, firefighters or teachers). The influenza vaccines available in Catalonia are subunit, adjuvanted and cell-based vaccines. The tetravalent vaccines have only been available since the 2016\u20132017 season for the vaccination of high-risk patients at hospital settings [12]. The vaccination coverage in our region is variable and goes from 10 to 70% depending on the age group, although the mean coverage is around 35% each season [13].",

Therefore, some differences were found between influenza types (A vs B) or subtypes (H1pdm09 vs H3), or vice versa regarding the age and the clinical outcomes of influenza-confirmed cases, such as hospitalisation, ICU-admission, and mortality rates. In the present study, the population susceptible to FLUAV infection seemed to be older than that susceptible for FLUBV, although FLUAV was predominant in almost all age groups, except to 5\u201314-year-old group in whom FLUBV prevailed as previously reported by other authors [31], [32]. On the other hand, while no differences were found between A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), the distribution of cases by age groups was different. The hospitalisation rate was variable throughout the study reporting differences between seasons, which might be related to the predominant influenza types or subtypes. Overall, FLUAV and A(H3N2) were related to higher hospitalisation rates than FLUBV and A(H1N1)pdm09, respectively. However, the association of A(H3N2) with a higher hospitalisation and lower ICU-admission rates than A(H1N1)pdm09 might be explained due to the high number of hospitalised cases during the 2014\u20132015 season when a drifted A(H3N2) virus was circulating [20]. Mortality rate was declining along the study period, not showing differences between FLUV types or subtypes, but highlighting the high mortality rate for A(H1N1)pdm09 during the 2012\u20132013 season when a low number of FLUAV cases was reported. This decreasing mortality rate over the four seasons could be related to the increase frequency of sampling due to the introduction of PCR-based methods to speed diagnostic and treatment and reducing complications.",

During the last seasons, A(H3N2) viruses acquired a great number of amino acid substitutions, diverging in different genetic clades and subclades as shown in the present study, and continuously changing the potential glycosylation features of HA. In fact, as previously commented, the high activity of A(H3N2) viruses during the 2014\u20132015 season was related to the circulation of A(H3N2) viruses antigenically different from the vaccine strain used [20]. However, the unpredictable evolution of FLUV together with the current challenges for the correct antigenic characterisation of A(H3N2) viruses, make difficult to forecast the vaccine composition for upcoming seasons [20].",

On one hand, A(H1N1)pdm09 strains from ICU-admitted cases carrying mutations D222G or D222N in HA1, which are still the unique genetic markers related to disease severity [23], [24], [25], [26], were detected during the 2012\u20132013 season but not in later seasons, when a higher A(H1N1)pdm09-related mortality rate was reported. Surely, the prevalence of variants carrying these mutations might be underestimated due to a suboptimal characterisation of severe influenza cases, since the virological surveillance of influenza viruses is overall carried out from samples collected from community-based surveillance networks. On the other hand, the emergence of genetically resistant variants to antiviral drugs is one of the main concerns of influenza surveillance and Public Health worldwide [9], [16]. In the present study, three viruses carrying the mutations H275Y and S247N, associated with resistance or reduced susceptibility to NAIs, were found in respiratory specimens from hospitalised patients under standard oseltamivir treatment during the 2015\u20132016 season. The fact that immunosuppression status and antiviral treatment administration are considered high-risk factors for the selection and emergence of resistant strains [35], conditions that are accomplished by many of the patients hospitalised in tertiary centres, highlights the importance to strengthen the virological surveillance of influenza viruses in hospital settings. While surveillance tasks in community-based networks is highly valuable, the information reported in hospital settings, where cases of severe disease or antiviral resistance are attended, should be always considered to monitor circulating viruses, in particular those with novel phenotypic features.",
