Cryptosporidium parvum develops in a wide variety of mammals, including humans, and is responsible for diarrhoeic disorders which are particularly serious in neonates and in immunosuppressed individuals (Dubey et al., 1990, O\u2019Donoghue, 1995). Cattle are a major source of C. parvum which is responsible for neonatal diarrhoea in calves and for zoonotic contamination (Angus, 1990, O\u2019Donoghue, 1995).",

            "text": "Bovine cryptosporidiosis is widespread and prevalence studies show a wide range of oocyst shedding from 14 to over 80% depending on the age, clinical situation and breeding regime of the animals (Chermette and Boufassa-Ouzrout, 1988, Angus, 1990, Garber et al., 1994, Fagan et al., 1995, Olson et al., 1997, de la Fuente et al., 1999). Overall, prevalence studies in cattle ranging from 3-day-old to adult usually give results of approximatively 20% of animals shedding oocysts (Quilez et al., 1996, Olson et al., 1997), while prevalence in neonates is higher, especially when diarrhoeic calves are concerned (Angus, 1990, Garber et al., 1994, Fagan et al., 1995, Quilez et al., 1996, SAC Veterinary Services, 1996, de la Fuente et al., 1999). However, the pathogenic role of cryptosporidia has remained controversial as they were often detected in combination with other enteropathogens such as rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli or Salmonella. Although some veterinary practitioners doubt the real pathogenicity of cryptosporidia, many experimental and field trials have demonstrated that cryptosporidia may act as a primary pathogen, sometimes being the predominant enteropathogens of calves (Tzipori et al., 1983, Heine et al., 1984, McDonough et al., 1994, SAC Veterinary Services, 1996, SAC Veterinary Services, 1997; de la Fuente, 1999).",

The methodology of Survey 1 ensured a good representative sample of the entire population of dairy calves as most of the included calves came from different dairy farms. This kind of protocol also generated a lot of data for a moderate cost. However, it does not allow an estimation of infected farms and it introduces a systematic bias resulting in an underestimation of the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis infection as dairy calves presenting diarrhoea are not usually sent to distribution centres. That is demonstrated by the low rate of diarrhoea (5.2%) observed during Survey 1. This survey probably gives a good estimation of the prevalence of infection in calves populations free of clinical symptoms. Finally, prevalence of infection was pretty stable over the 1-year follow-up, except in July and August which had a lower prevalence of 7 and 8%, respectively. This result is linked to the seasonal incidence of calving which usually shows a decrease during summer. Consequently, the more susceptible calves, i.e. those younger than 1 month, represent a small population at that period of the year which might explain the lower contamination of livestock.",

This is reinforced by the fact that the selection of farms was the decision of the investigators who possibly selected livestock farms with a history of cryptosporidiosis. This second survey probably gives a good estimation of the prevalence of the infection in populations experiencing clinical symptoms. The 43.4% mean prevalence found in this survey confirms that the prevalence of cryptosporodiosis is higher in diarrhoeic than in non-diarrhoeic calves, as found in other studies (Angus, 1990, Quilez et al., 1996). Compared with the prevalence of oocyst excretion in diarrhoeic calves from other European countries, our results are higher than those in Denmark (17%), Hungary (27%), and UK (23\u201332.9%), similar to those reported in Italy (40%), Germany (40\u201344%), and the Irish Republic (44.4%), but lower than those from central Spain (52.3%), the Netherland (55%), and Finland (76%) (Angus, 1990, Fagan et al., 1995, SAC Veterinary Services, 1996, de la Fuente et al., 1999).

However, our results reflect a prevalence of cryptosporidiosis at a point in time as calves were sampled only once. As the pattern of antigen and oocyst excretion in calves is intermittent and false negatives can result if animals are sampled only once (Farrington et al., 1995, McCluskey et al., 1995), a 100% prevalence for calves between 1 and 30 days of age is possible, which means that all animals will pass oocysts at least once during this period of time (Xiao and Herd, 1994, McCluskey et al., 1995).",

Antigen capture ELISA techniques are sufficiently sensitive to detect clinical cases of cryptosporidiosis when numerous oocysts are shed (McCluskey et al., 1995, Peeters and Villacorta, 1995), however, more sensitive techniques, such as immunofluorescence or concentration techniques, are necessary in cases of light infection with calves passing few oocysts (Robert et al., 1990, Xiao and Herd, 1993, Webster et al., 1996).

Cryptosporidia were detected in 43.4% (191/440 ) of the calves in Survey 2, while 90.5% (398/440) of the animals showed diarrhoea. The remaining diarrhoeic animals without Cryptosporidium infection at the time of sampling may reflect either a lack of sensitivity of the detection method and/or the involvement of other infectious agents (e.g. rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli, Salmonella or Giardia), environmental or nutritional factors, which were not investigated according to our initial objective. The present surveys demonstrate that Cryptosporidium infection of calves is wide-spread in France and that further studies are needed to show the relative importance of cryptosporidia, which have emerged as major enteropathogens of calves, in the neonatal diarrhoea syndrome.",
