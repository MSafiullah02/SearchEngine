However, even a much milder epidemic would have vast social impact as services such as health care, police and utilities became severely hampered by staff shortages. Workplace absenteeism might also become a serious concern [49]; for example, the New Zealand government has predicted overall absenteeism levels as high as 40% ([34] and references therein) 1",

In contrast to our focus, much valuable research has been directed at addressing the epidemic itself; such work studies public health measures that would reduce the epidemic's severity and its direct impact, for example by managing the supply of vaccines and antivirals (see [35, 28, 36] ).

In cases such as police departments, staff would likely be more exposed to the epidemic than the general public and (particularly if vaccines are in short supply, or apply to the wrong virus mutation) shortfalls may take place just when there is greatest demand for services. Power plants and waste water treatment plants are examples of facilities whose operation will be degraded as staff falls short and which probably require minimum staff levels to operate at all [29] . Supply chains would very likely be significantly slowed down as their staff is depleted, resulting, for example, in food shortages [43] . In all these cases, organizations cannot implement \"work from home\" strategies as urged for private businesses by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Department of Labor 2 .",

Such additional resources are likely to be significantly constrained in quantity, duration and rate, among other factors. Such emergency staff deployment plans would entail some complexity in design, calibration and implementation, but as a result of other disasters such, as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the anthrax attacks in 2001, it is now agreed that there is a compelling need for emergency planning [20] . 1 In the healthcare setting, the opposite may take place: health care workers reportedly avoid calling in sick during an emergency [18, 8] 2 http://www.osha.gov/Publications/employers-protect-workers-flu-factsheet.html 1 arXiv:1507.08648v1 [math.OC] 30 Jul 2015",

The evolution of the contagion rate is a function of poorly understood dynamics in the mutations of the different strains of the flu virus and environmental agents such as weather [10, 37] . In addition to uncertainty, a decision-maker will also likely be constrained by logistics. In particular, it may prove impossible to carry out large changes to staff deployment plans on short notice, particularly if such staff is also in demand by other organizations (as might be the case during a severe epidemic). We will return to these issues in Sections 6.2 and 8. As a consequence of the two factors (uncertainty, and logistical constraints) a decision-maker may commit too few or too many resources -in this case emergency staff-or perhaps at the wrong time, if there turns out to be a mismatch between the anticipated level of staff shortage and what actually transpires (after the resources have been committed).",

Staff shortfall directly resulting from individuals becoming sick could be intensified by policy or absenteeism. For example, during the last H1N1 influenza outbreak, CDC recommended that people with influenza-like symptoms remain at home until at least 24 hours after they are or appear to be free of fever. In the particular case of health care workers it is advised that they refrain from work for at least 7 days after symptoms first appear (see [17] for additional details). Moreover, staff shortages may occur not only due to actual illness, but also from illness among family members, quarantines, school closures (combined with lack of child care), public transportation disruptions, low morale, or because workers could be summoned to comply with public service obligations [49, 21] . Indeed, employees who have been exposed to the disease (especially those coming into contact with an ill person at home) may also be asked to stay at home and monitor their own symptoms.",

The infectivity of the disease can be approximated using serologic data and contact rates are usually estimated from census and transportation data after making assumptions about the contact processes that reduce the number of unknowns to the number of age classes. However, both contact or infection rates estimates can serve only as a baseline; a population could change its behavior significantly during a severe epidemic (due to school closures, for example); further, environmental changes (e.g. weather changes) could also have a significant impact on the virus transmissibility [37] .",

It seems very difficult to predict the evolution of new virus strains. In fact, as far as we know [44, 40] ) research that relates mutations of influenza virus to infectivity is inconclusive. Previous work has proposed different upper and lower bound values for p, depending, among other factors, on the geographical location of the study and the pandemic wave of interest. For example, [51] uses the interval [0.025, 0.5] while [0.02, 0.16] is used in [52] . Both studies use these intervals to conduct sensitivity analysis. In another study, Larson [33] classifies the population into three groups according to social activity levels; the three groups have p value 0.07, 0.09 and 0.12 and corresponding \u03bb values 50, 10 and 2, respectively. In summary, the precise estimation of p values appears quite challenging, especially prior to or even during an epidemic. Given this uncertainty, it is likely that basing the response to an epidemic on a fixed estimate for p is incorrect. To illustrate the impact of such a decision we refer the reader to Figure 1 . It shows the availability of staff as a function of time, for different two values of p, from two different perspectives. Figure 1a shows how the workforce becomes ill at the actual time it happens. In contrast, 1b presents these curves all starting from the time the epidemic is declared. Indeed, a planner deploying a contingency plan at the moment an epidemic is declared would be interested in the preparing for different scenarios according to what is shown in 1b, rather than 1a. This point will be touched upon again in Section 6.2.",

For p = 0.015 this period spans days 18 through 37 (from the declaration of the epidemic), whereas for p = 0.01 the baseline is not reached. As expected, the epidemic is more severe for higher values of p; however, somewhat lower values of p result in longer-lasting epidemics. In particular, p = 0.01 results in an extended period of time (days 13 through 69) where even though staff availability is above the baseline, it is still significantly below 100%. If, in the above example, p were unknown, a planner would have to carefully ration scarce resources over a nearly month-long period. If the planner were to assume a fixed value for p throughout the epidemic, then the example suggests allocating comparatively higher levels of surge staff to earlier periods of time, to overcome the higher shortfalls to be expected in the case of higher values for p. Of course, this higher level of initial allocation needs to be carefully chosen to obtain maximum reward.",

Here, p changes from 0.012 to 0.03 on day 130, 28 days after the epidemic has been declared. Thus, for more than half of the epidemic, the disease spreads slowly and even though the 90% baseline is approached, it is not reached. However, after the change in p the epidemic becomes severe and a significant shortfall arises. This type of variability would be especially problematic when resources are limited. The epidemic, on the basis of observations of its initial progression, would likely be classified as relatively mild, and, perhaps, action might be taken to at least partially abandon the surge staff buildup. However, if the a change in p as shown in Figure 2 were plausible, then a careful planner would have to hedge by hold backing staff so as to handle the potentially critical situation in later periods. Should the change in p not take place, the chart indicates that any held back staff would essentially be wasted. And should the change take place somewhat earlier, then the opportunity cost is significantly higher. The critical question, of course, is whether this type of virus behavior is possible. As far as we can tell, current knowledge of the influenza virus cannot categorically reject a change in p as shown, although planning for such a change might be construed as an overly conservative action. Thus, it remains to be seen if a robust strategy that can protect against a change in p entails higher cost or other compromises. In this paper we model the variability of the product \u03bb j p using techniques derived from robust optimization. For ease of exposition, we assume that the infectivity probability p is uncertain, and that the values for the contact rates \u03bb j are fixed (and known); thus the contact probabilities \u03b2 t are also fixed. Our goal is to produce surge staff deployment strategies that are robust with respect to variability of p in a number of models of uncertainty. Robust optimization provides an agnostic methodology for assessing competing allocation plans and for computing good plans according to various criteria. Above, we described two such criteria. Our optimization procedures are fast and flexible, making it possible to evaluate multiple plans and different levels of conservatism in a practicable time frame.",

Consequently, future epidemic waves will necessarily be milder and cause decreased social cost (so surge staff will be less critical). On the other hand, over a long period we could have well-separated strong epidemic waves. However, we would argue that from the perspective of surge staff deployment, each such wave should be handled as a separate event, with its own surge staff deployment strategy. A significant element in our approach is that it produces a fixed deployment vector h 1 , . . . , h T which, from a formal standpoint, will be applied regardless of observed conditions. Of course, the strategy should be interpreted as a template and a planner would apply small deviations from the planned surge levels, as needed.

Additionally, we assumed an epidemic is declared only once. In other words, once the rate of infectives slow down below the epidemic threshold, the epidemic is considered to be terminated.",

This shows the importance of Scenario 1 as the costliest case and, at the same time, how the strategy hedges against scenarios where the epidemic has its peak later (than under the No-Action-Max-Cost tuple), even if not so aggressively. In particular, the last wave of staff deployed by the Robust Policy (on days 54, 58, and 63) could seem somehow wasteful under Scenario 1; however their utility is displayed under Scenario 2, where the Robust Policy tackles a delayed, weaker \u03c1 peak much more effectively than the Na\u00efve-worst-case Policy.

The total number of available volunteers is 2, 000 and the contact rates are not dampened while the epidemic is being declared. All other data remains as in the first example. Following the same logic as in the previous example, we present the Robust Policy and compare it to the Na\u00efve-worst-case Policy (obtained as before by solving the linear program associated with the worst-case tuple of our uncertainty set). We present results for the same three scenarios: the No-Action-Max-Cost tuple, the costliest tuple for the Na\u00efve-worst-case Policy, and the costliest tuple for the Robust Policy, respectively. This fact hints on the nonconvexity of the problem, a topic we will touch upon later in this section. Table 4 displays the results. The Robust Policy is worse than the Na\u00efve-worst-case Policy in the first instance, while keeping a fairly consistent and low cost for the other scenarios; where the Na\u00efve-worst-case Policy does not perform as well. What is worth noting is that, unlike in the previous example, the structure of the deployment strategies is much more similar (see Figure 4) ; nevertheless, the small differences make the Robust Policy more resilient to other scenarios.

Table 5 displays the change in the worst-case cost given that the corresponding policy is being implemented and its corresponding cost if no contingency plan had been put in place. Similarly, the change in the maximum value of \u03c1 and the number of days that \u03c1 is at or above 1 are also presented. The last row of the table shows the ratio between the change in the worst-case cost and the change in the number of available surge staff. For example, when there are 1, 500 volunteers available, there is a change in the cost of 0.156% for each of the 500 that are now not at hand. At the same time, the benefit obtained per additional worker available decreases for both the Robust and the Na\u00efve-worst-Case Policy, but more so for the latter. This is again because the Robust Policy allocates the additional staff to cover up for different bad cases, while the Na\u00efve-worst-case Policy has only one scenario to focus on. This is depicted in Figure 5 : for the cases in which the Robust Policy has more surge staff available, more people are hired towards the end of the planning horizon, while the Na\u00efve-worst-case Policies look to tackle the system congestion early after the epidemic has been declared.

In the tests reported in Tables 6 and 7 , p is allowed to change to a value larger than 0.0135 and allowed to change later than in day 160. Thus, the experiments go out-of-sample in two ways. The tests were constructed as follows. First, the epidemic is declared on day 113 with deployment under the Robust Policy beginning on day 140, i.e. 28 days after the declaration. As we saw in Example 1, the costliest tuple should the Robust Policy be implemented is (0.01168, 0.0135, 140) (thus, p changes on the day of deployment). Table 6 evaluates the Robust Policy (and the No-Intervention policy) against this tuple, and also against tuples of the form (0.01168,p,d), withp = 0.014, or 0.015 andd = 150, 155, 160, and 165 and greater.

Most importantly, the cost of the Robust Policy decreases rapidly asd moves out of scope of the original model. In fact, the same is true even under the No-Intervention Policy. This is the salient fact that we want to point out. Its explanation is simple: even though p is increasing to a larger value than originally envisioned, ifd is large, the impact of the increase is negligible -the increase is taking place so late, that by then the epidemic (under the initial p value) has largely run its course. In other words, we have a long-running epidemic which, under the Robust Policy, ends up having no impact.",

However, the proper statement to make is that the plans will be conservative only if the data (the tranches, in particular) allow it to be so. A different drawback in this model is that an adversary could simply \"wait\" to change p until just after the review period S. As the experiments in Section 7.1.5 indicate, if S is not too small the impact of such a late change in p is much decreased. If S is chosen too large, then the adversary can change p much earlier, and then the impact will be felt before the review can take place. Thus, care must be chosen in selecting S. A review strategy that proceeds dynamically is given next.",

There are current concerns that an influenza virus might mutate into a highly contagious strain for which humans have little or no immunity, resulting in a rapid widespread of the disease. In the event of such an epidemic, or pandemic, organizations that provide critical social infrastructure, such as health care clinics, police departments, public utilities, food markets and supply chains are likely to face severe workforce shortage that would jeopardize their continuity of operations. In particular, at the most critical stage of the epidemic, health care clinics would be required to provide care for an extraordinary number of patients, and thus could ill-afford staff shortfalls. To address these issues, the CDC and the HHS Department have urged organizations to design contingency plans. As part these plans, organizations would deploy emergency 'surge' staff to compensate for a potential deficit in workers' availability.",

In this study we are considering the entire workforce of a particular organization as a whole; however, as part of the contingency plans proposed by the CDC, organizations are encouraged to identify critical staff positions and cross-train personnel accordingly. The model could also be furthered refine by modeling varying levels of exposure according to different subgroups of employees.

The resulting algorithm, while theoretically efficient, may not be practical. Instead, in practice researchers in the nonconvex optimization community would rely on a classical cutting-plane algorithm such as Algorithm B. This discussion highlights the importance, both theoretical and practical, of Step 2 of the algorithm, namely the computation of argmax p\u2208P V (h | p) for a given deployment vector h. This is a one-dimensional maximization problem, but possibly non-concave (recall Figure 6b) . In this context, an important experimental observation is that the computation of V (h | p) for given h and p is extremely fast, even for large T -typically, V (h | p) can be computed in approximately one hundred thousandth of a second on a modern computer. In our implementation we make use of this observation by discretizing the set P.",

The computation of the worst tuple is the most time-consuming task at each iteration. At present we have implemented this step as a search process which could be improved in a number of ways. However, the algorithm appears effective; note that in this case the total CPU time does not exceed 35 seconds. Table 8 also shows how fast the algorithm converged for this example. In terms of the enhancement, we chose the maximum number of iterations to be K = 10 and = 0.05. The enhancement was used for the first 8 iterations, after which only one more cut was added to the Master Problem. The resulting duality gap is slightly larger than 0.005%. ",

Further, J min = 18 and J max = 60. A realization of the data is the following: J = 20, p (1) = .155, H = I 3 and p (2) = .19. Thus, for t < 20 we have p t = .155 while for t \u2265 20, p t = .19. Suppose S = 30. The decisionmaker knows that .15 \u2264 p 1 \u2264 .18; at time S = 30 the decision-maker observes the tranche I 3 and thus knows that for t \u2265 30, .18 \u2264 p t \u2264 .19, leading to an appropriate set of deployments for future periods.",

It is worth mentioning that with each iteration the program acquires a significant number of constraints: for a single tuple, under the queueing scenario, there are close to 2,800 constraints and more than 2,500 variables (after pre-solving). Thus, we expect K to be small (not larger than 10).Once Procedure A terminates, we start Algorithm B, with the proviso that the Master Problem is initialized as:Algorithm B is then run as before.
