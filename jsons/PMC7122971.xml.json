            "text": "Although viruses tend to be diverse in terms of the diseases they cause and the organs they attack, all viruses have a unity of structure and consist of proteins and nucleic acid. Some viruses are also encased in a lipid membranous envelope (Fig. 2.1). Their mode of replication is not binary (one divides into two, two divide into four, etc.), as in most other organisms, but occurs as a burst of thousands of virus particles from a single virus over a short time. The number of viruses produced in cell culture or the blood is in the tens of millions per milliliter of media or blood. This mode of replication alone makes viruses unique. All other life forms contain DNA as genetic material and RNA as a message or intermediate for the formation of proteins or other structures. Viruses are also unique in that they contain either RNA or DNA as the genetic material. To date, no virus has been discovered that contains both types of nucleic acid as genetic material, although both types are used during virus replication in the cell. Viruses do not contain ribosomes, mitochondria or other cell-like organelles, and are thus completely parasitic. Since they cannot replicate without the metabolic processes of the host cell, they are genetic parasites. This differentiates viruses from bacteria or other single-cell microorganisms (e.g., protozoa), most of which can replicate in culture on their own, although they can also be parasitic. One other feature distinguishing viruses from other organisms in general is their small size and ability to pass through filters. This was certainly a major criterion in the early days of virology, although large viruses have recently been discovered. Viruses were not retained by filters made from diatomaceous earth (kieselguhr), extensively used at the beginning of the twentieth century. This characteristic was originally used as the major characteristic in differentiating a virus from bacteria, fungus or protozoa.\n",

In 1931, two German scientists, Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll, invented the electron microscope (Fig. 2.2). This was a great improvement over the light microscope and allowed one to actually \u201csee\u201d viruses. One major disadvantage, however, is that the preparation for visualizing material by EM may distort the specimen because viable material cannot be used. The EM, as it became, uses electrons speeded up in a vacuum, aimed at the specimen, and gives an outline of the structure on an electron-sensitive photographic plate. Ernst Ruska later moved to the Siemens Company in Germany, where the first commercial electron microscope was developed. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986.\n\n",

Is a bean seed alive? It has the properties of life under certain circumstances, but can be kept in an inert state for years. As soon as it is planted under appropriate conditions, it becomes \u201calive.\u201d A virus differs in that it cannot reproduce unless it is in a host cell. Thus, one may think of the virus as the bean and the host cell as the soil. Viruses use the metabolism of the host cell, although there are large viruses, such as smallpox, that carry genes similar to those of the host cell, which code for metabolic enzymes, and some genes mimic those of the host cell and thus disrupt cellular metabolism by acting as decoys. These viral products are termed virokines. However, even such viruses cannot multiply on their own since they need cellular components for their replication and protein synthetic apparatus. Where did those mimicking genes come from? Were these genes derived from the host cell since they mimic host functions and interfere with these functions, or were they acquired by the host eons ago from the virus? (This is a controversial and open question). Thus the virus is at the edge of life, and can exist in two states\u2014an inert state and a living state.",

            "text": "In 2004, a large virus (Mimivirus) was discovered in a strain of amoeba, [3]. It is considered and called a virus since it cannot replicate outside its host, and although it carries genes for many metabolic functions, it does not code for ribosomal genes, making it dependent on the host cell for protein synthesis. It is as large as many bacteria, but despite this, it seems to be another example of an entity at the boundary between living and inert forms. One has to consider a continuum from the inert chemical (organic chemical) to more complex ones with the ability to reproduce, which then gives life. The definition of life or living is an arbitrary one (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-07758-1_4 on bacteriophage), and is defined in different ways by different scientists and philosophers. The discovery of the Mimivirus has given rise to the discussion as to whether this is an ancestor of other viruses or is the result of genes breaking away from the host and becoming independent. An electron micrograph of Mimivirus is shown in Fig. 2.3, and a schematic in Fig. 2.4.\n\n",

When a virus kills a cell in culture, it is referred to as a lytic infection and in the whole organism, such as a human as an acute infection. Examples of this type of infection are poliovirus, the common cold virus (rhinovirus), and smallpox. Such viruses either \u201ckill\u201d the host or are eventually controlled by the immune system and are thus self-limiting.",

The interaction occurs through the binding of the virus to a unique receptor domain on the cell membrane (Fig. 2.11). This receptor is a normal component of the cell and may have other functions. Virus proteins are made and modify the host cell metabolism so that host proteins are no longer made, or the host cell replication cycle is affected. All of this is to allow the virus to produce more of itself, thus diverting cell metabolism to virus production. The viral proteins are produced in one part of the cell, the replicated nucleic acid in another, and somehow they find each other, interact, and form virus particles that are expelled from the cell. These viruses then infect nearby cells. Immediately after infection in vivo, the body reacts by producing interferon and other immune enhancing molecules known as cytokines, which are the first line of defense against the virus; this response is called \u201cinnate immunity.\u201d Adaptive immunity, the production of antibodies for a specific virus, will not occur until much later (10\u201321 days). Symptoms usually occur a few days after infection, although during this asymptomatic period a person may be infectious. This is particularly true in the case of viruses such as HIV, where obvious symptoms may not occur for quite some time (The role of the immune response is discussed in detail in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-07758-1_6).",

Thus some viruses, such as hepatitis virus, attack the liver and no other tissue. Other viruses, such as the common cold virus (rhinovirus), have adapted to cooler body temperatures and infect the lining of the nose, which is cooler than the rest of the body. Mutations in a receptor\u2014or lack thereof\u2014can lead to resistance to virus infection.

Adults with naturally acquired rhinovirus colds have been found to contaminate 35 % of environmental surfaces in hotel rooms after overnight occupancy, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) to detect viral RNA. In addition, viral RNA on surfaces (light switch, phone button, and telephone handset) could be transferred to fingertips during activities of daily life. Although RTPCR measures viral RNA contamination, parallel experiments testing for growth of virus in cell culture resulted in similar results. Virus could be found on these objects for as long as 18 h. There are, however, two conflicting sets of data on how rhinoviruses are spread, one maintaining that the virus is predominantly spread by indirect contact through nasal secretions, the other that the major mode of transmission is through aerosol. Studies at the University of Wisconsin have shown that when individuals with a cold are kept in the same room with uninfected individuals, the virus does spread by aerosol, but not as fast as expected. It may take hours of exposure for others to contract the cold. However, in these experiments, virus was not detectable on game chips, suggesting that in the case of contact infection, there is a need for large amounts of fresh secretion [8].

Symptoms of norovirus illness usually begin about 24\u201348 h after exposure to the virus, but they can appear as early as 12 h after ingestion of contaminated food. People infected with norovirus are contagious from the moment they begin feeling ill until at least 3 days after recovery. Some people may be contagious for as long as 2 weeks. Therefore, it is particularly important for people to practice good hand-washing after having recently recovered from a norovirus.
