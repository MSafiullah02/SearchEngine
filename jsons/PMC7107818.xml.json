We acknowledge that the presence of diabetes mellitus in the first patient and the use of high-dose methylprednisolone in the second patient might have further compromised their host immunity. However, the fact that TB was isolated from the sputum sample only 4 days after initiation of intravenous methylprednisolone argues against corticosteroids as a contributing factor for immunosuppression.",

It is highly likely that both of our patients developed active pulmonary TB after acquiring SARS because both presented with clinical syndromes consistent with SARS that were supported by laboratory findings, and they both recovered well, with initial biochemical and radiological improvement, without anti-TB therapy. It is possible that infection with the SARS coronavirus causes a temporary suppression of cellular immunity which further predisposed our patients to aggravated reactivation or new infection with TB, much as is the case with the measles virus and HIV.",
