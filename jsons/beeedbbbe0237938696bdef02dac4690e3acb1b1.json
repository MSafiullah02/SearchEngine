All areas of research within IR thus strive to improve relevance of documents to a user's information need (IN). These research areas of IR can be broadly divided into two: system-oriented and user-oriented IR. Whereas the system-oriented viewpoint ties relevance to be an objective property of the document and query content, the user-oriented approach to IR views relevance as a cognitive property. Although IR fundamentally involves user interaction and decision-making, the user-oriented approach has been found harder to implement, especially in evaluating performance of IR systems. This is because of the variability in user judgements of relevance [5] .",

Order effects have been investigated and found to exist in IR in the presentation order of documents [4, 6, 9, 24] . For example, in a recent study reported in [22] , two groups of participants were presented with a pair of documents D 1 and D 2 in two different orders. For some of such pairs, it was found that the relevance of a document judged by users is different depending on the order it was presented. Although the phenomenon may appear to have an intuitive explanation, it violates one of the fundamental assumptions of classical probability theory -joint distributions, where, for two random variables representing relevance of the documents -R 1 , R 2 , P (R 1 , R 2 ) = P (R 2 , R 1 ), i.e., the order of judging the documents does not matter. Order effects violate this fundamental assumption. Such order effects have also been investigated and reported in between the different dimensions of relevance, like Topicality, Understandability, Reliability, etc. [1, 19, 20] , where different orders of dimensions considered to judge a document lead to different relevance judgements.",

            "text": "The field of Quantum Cognition [2] offers a generalised framework to model probabilistic outcomes of human decision-making. It has been successful in modelling and predicting order effects [16, 23] and other paradoxical findings where axioms of classical probability theory are violated [3, 14] . Conceptually, it challenges the notion that cognitive states have pre-defined values and that a measurement merely records them. Instead, the act of measurement creates a definite state out of an indefinite state and in doing so, changes the initial state of the cognitive system. In terms of relevance, we cannot pre-assign relevance of a document for a user. Instead, relevance is defined only at the point of interaction of the user's cognitive state with the document. Therefore, judgement of document D 2 first, changes user's initial state and the subsequent judgement of relevance of D 1 is different than when D 1 is judged before D 2 . Should relevance of the documents for a user be a pre-defined entity, it would not be influenced by judgement of other documents and a joint distribution over relevance of the two documents would exist. We also say that these two measurements of relevance are incompatible with each other. That is, it is not possible to jointly consider the relevance of the two documents, at the same time. At the mathematical level, measurements in quantum theory are represented by operators, which in general, do not commute with each other. In a classical system, all measurements will commute with each other. However, conversely, commutativity of measurements does not necessarily imply that the system is classical. Therefore, the type of measurements becomes imperative in identifying a quantum system. Even then, not all measurements on quantum systems generate data violating the classical probability theory. The system needs to be probed in a way which exploits the underlying quantum structure. In physics, this was done by experiments such as Stern-Gerlach and double-slit experiments [15] which showed the violation of classical probability principles for microscopic particles like electrons and photons. In cognitive science too, several experiments performed by Tversky, Kahneman and colleagues showed such violations in human decision-making under uncertainty [17] .",

By quantum-like structure we mean the representation of a system using the mathematical framework of quantum theory in order to model and predict the experimental data. In [19] , this experiment was performed in an IR scenario involving judgement of relevance with respect to different dimensions. Extending from the Stern-Gerlach protocol, in this paper we design a new experiment to show the violation of classical probability theory in multidimensional relevance judgements. We hypothesise that multidimensional relevance judgement has an underlying quantum-like structure, which when subject to appropriate measurement design can exhibit violations of classical probability theory. Specifically, we investigate the violation of a particular axiom of Kolmogorovian probability theory [11] . Our results show that the experimental data indeed violates classical probability theory, and a quantum framework provides more accurate predictions to describe the data. This experiment not only shows the necessity of the quantum framework as an alternative for constructing probabilistic models, but also gives novel insights into user behaviour in IR. This understanding can contribute to improvement of interactive IR systems and we also discuss such implications in this paper.",

The S-G experiment [15] was an important milestone in quantum physics as it showed the non-classical behaviour of microscopic systems. The key was a particular design of the experiment which exploited the incompatibility between measurement of electron spin states along different axes. An electron has a particular property (a) Asking three questions in TUR order (b) Asking three questions in TRU order Fig. 1 . S-G type experiment to construct a complex-valued Hilbert space called spin, having two possible values -up (+), down (-), which can be measured along different axes. An electron may have spin state + along the x-axis but state \u2212 along y-axis. So the outcome of measurement of the spin property of the electron depends upon the axis of measurement. Also, any measurement of spin disturbs the system. If a measurement of spin is made along X axis and Z axis, then a third measurement along X axis may give a different answer than the first one. This phenomena is called measurement incompatibility, where two measurements cannot be jointly conducted on a system -one measurement disturbs the system and the other would then measure the changed system. The S-G experiment also describes the minimum number of measurements required from a system to construct a complex-valued Hilbert Space structure. In particular, we need three incompatible measurements each with two mutually exclusive outcomes. We can use this arrangement of measuring properties of a quantum system to measure relevance of a document in IR. For this, we consider three dimensions of relevance: Topicality (T ) -whether a document is topically relevant to a query, Understandability (U ) -how easy it is to understand the content of the document, and Reliability (R) -how much can the document be relied upon. Each of these three dimensions can be posed as questions requiring a Yes/No type answer (denoted as + and \u2212 respectively) for a document. These three dimensions are important factors considered by users for deciding relevance. Besides, they are tied to a single document, unlike diversity or novelty, which is always considered in comparison with other documents. Certain dimensions like Interest, Habit, etc. are difficult to ascertain via crowdsourcing. As reported in [1] , the different relevance dimensions can exhibit incompatibility for certain query-document pairs.",

For two such vectors, their projection onto each other is given as the square of their inner product -| A|B | 2 . Each vector is written as a linear combination of the vectors of the basis in which it is represented. For the purpose of representing the cognitive state of a person judging a document as topically relevant or topically irrelevant, we consider a basis formed by two orthogonal vectors |T + and |T \u2212 respectively. Before a user considers a judgement of topicality, the cognitive state is indefinite with respect to considering the document as topically relevant or irrelevant. Both potentialities exist. We say that the cognitive state collapses to either |T + or |T \u2212 after the judgement. Before the judgement, we can represent the indefinite cognitive state in terms of probabilities of its potential responses. This is represented as a linear combination of the two basis states, weighted each by real or complex coefficients (called probability amplitudes), such that the square of the probability amplitude gives the probability of collapsing to the respective state. The initial state S is thus written as: In the S-G inspired experiment design, we ask the user sequential questions about judgement of Topicality (T), Understandability (U) and Reliability (R) in the order TUR or TRU, as shown in Fig. 1 .

We already have the single question probabilities from the experiment in [19] and we need to obtain the probabilities of conjunction and disjunction. We do so by posing questions about Understandability and Reliability at the same time, as a pair, rather than sequentially. Each of the dimensions have two outcomes (e.g. Reliable or Not Reliable) and therefore we construct four pairs of statements, as listed in Fig. 4 . For the disjunction measurement, we ask the participants to select whether they agree with at least one of the two statements or none of them (corresponding to a Boolean Or condition). For a conjunction measurement on each of the four statement pairs, we ask the participants whether they agree with both of the questions or not. Figure 5a and b show the designs for the disjunction and conjunction questions for a query-document pair. We now have a total of eight such questions and we follow a between-subjects design such that a participant is shown only one of these eight questions randomly. Note that we are able to use the probabilities from the experiment in [19] because our experiment is a between-subjects design. The same participant is not asked all the questions -to avoid memory bias. The design is summarised in the following steps for each of the three query-document pairs:",

As we can see, if operators of U and R commute with each other, the quantum correction term in the Eq. (7) approaches zero (the commutator is zero). In fact, the probability values obtained may violate some of the other basic axioms of classical/Kolmogorovian probability. For example, for Query 2, we can see that P (U \u2212\u2227R+|T +) = 0.414 and P (U \u2212|T +) = 0.198 which clearly violates P (A, B) < P (A). Also, for this query, P (U \u2212\u2227R\u2212|T +) is greater than both P (U \u2212 |T +) and P (R \u2212 |T +). This type of violation has been termed as conjunction fallacy in the cognitive science literature [18] . Quantum models have been previously used to explain such violation [3] where the fundamental notion of incompatibility in judgements is identified as the potential cause. Figure 7 shows a comparison between quantum and classical probabilities with the experimental data for first two queries. The data for Query 3 had many probabilities close to 0 (see Fig. 2 ) and hence the sample became too small for a meaningful comparison. The probabilities are calculated for prediction of judgement of Reliability given the participant has judged Understandability and Topicality (positively), using equations derived in Sect. 2.1. Bayesian probabilities, in some cases, are significantly different from experimental data (P (R + |U \u2212, T +) for query 1 and P (R \u2212 |U \u2212, T +) for query 2). Quantum probabilities are consistently closer to the experimental data.",

The fundamental assumption here is that the variables corresponding to R, U and T can be jointly measured. In terms of the judgement process, this implies that a user can jointly consider information regarding the Reliability, Understandability and Topicality of a document with respect to the query. The incompatibility revealed in [19] and the order effects shown in [1] suggest that this is not always the case in general. Therefore we see Bayesian predictions deviate from the experimental data. As the quantum probability theory based on the Hilbert space model is free from this assumption of compatibility, it provides a promising alternative model that gives predictions closer to the experimental data. In fact, the modelling of incompatibility of different judgement perspectives forms one of the pillars of the Quantum Cognition research framework. ",

Therefore, different orders of consideration of dimensions would lead to different final relevance judgements, making the order a factor in the variability of relevance judgements by users. When using an IR system to perform a task or make an important decision, there might be a particular order of dimensions which can lead the user to make an optimal decision. For example, for a health related query, a user might find a document difficult to understand, which may affect his or her judgement of Reliability and hence the overall relevance. However, if another user first judges reliability and finds it highly reliable, the judgement of understandability might be different. The IR system can help users to consider the optimum sequence of dimensions and thus maximise the utility, by providing extra information. For example, if the system can also provide information about the Reliability of the document in terms of a Reliability score or ratings by other users, it can reduce uncertainty in judgement and thus minimise the influence of judgement of other dimensions. Thus, for the given medical document, the low understandability might not affect the perception of Reliability.",
