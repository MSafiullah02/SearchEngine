All these possibilities present unique operational challenges, such as imposition of unpractised routines in the context of rapid incremental demand for inpatient census. Furthermore, most options need hospital staffing to be increased at a time when the case-mix index can also be expected to increase. However, during some public-health emergencies, especially those of a communicable nature, hospitals are likely to have substantial reductions in available staff, as happened during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak.17, 18, 19 Thus, for acute-care hospitals, a means to achieve maximum availability of capacity resources to allow for the care of victims of a disaster is a priority.20\n",

The aim of this phase was to develop a disposition classification system (reverse triage) based on risk tolerance of a consequential medical event as a result of discharge; assuming that critical interventions were withdrawn or withheld. We focus on the main components of the first phase: (1) conceptualisation of the disposition classification system; (2) development of operational definitions of consequential medical events and critical interventions; and (3) derivation of risk estimates related to early discharge from a multidisciplinary panel of experts. Subsequent phases of this project will use clinical data obtained from nearly 4000 hospital patients to examine the validity of the classification system to correctly identify those who can be discharged early.",

To accomplish this, measurable outcomes and prognostic variables are required. The panel initially defined critical interventions as a means to understand the notions of risk. However, the consensus critical interventions will also serve as the outcome measures in subsequent studies. What constitutes a consequential medical event is subjective. Thus, the critical interventions that are the outcome proxy measures were weighted for likely importance. Future analysis will consider the accuracy of such weighting.",

In view of the increasing trend toward electronic medical data, prognostic variables of potential interest\u2014eg, vital signs, key laboratory values, diagnostic considerations, co-morbid conditions\u2014could be captured and continuously updated in real-time. Thus, in the event of a disaster, patients would be predesignated for the lowest risk disposition options, through the use of a system such as the one proposed here. If such a system were in place, each patient would have a continuously, updated reliable risk score to assist in disposition making. Starting with those with the lowest risk, discharges would take place in an ascending order of risk. Furthermore, in the future when prognostic scoring of risk for pre-hospital or emergency-department based disaster triage are developed and reliable, the entire demand for inpatient resources from all sources can be simultaneously ascertained and decisions made accordingly. The value of such a device is not only to augment surge capacity, but also to help with rapid decisions when complete or part hospital evacuations are required, such as happened during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Toronto.",

Simulating a disaster, we randomly sampled non-intensive-care unit adult patients from 50 medical units in our three-hospital system during 19 weeks.37 Of the 4781 patients sampled, 786 (16%) were discharged routinely on the day of the disaster. Of the remaining patients, 2797 (70%) either had no critical interventions or were discharged in any event during the next 72 h. Although full analysis remains to be completed, these data are consistent with those reported by Davis and colleagues.38 Physicians and nurses in this study opined that about 50% of patients were dischargeable during 72 h. When controlling for patients in intensive-care, the proportion of capacity is similar to ours. Finally, a study from a tertiary-care teaching hospital in the UK, also using opinion survey of nurses showed that more than a third of inpatient beds (including those in intensive-care units) could be made available within 4\u201312 h of a disaster if increased care were available in the community.39\n",

Although many of the panellists have varied geographic and institutional experience, we did not attempt to ensure that every hospital structure and size was represented by all disciplines. Thus, inherent geographic or regional bias in the established ranges of risk tolerance could have occurred. However, as noted, about 25% of the panel were not from our system, and most of the panellists had other national and international experience. Even so, the model described is sufficiently robust that risk tolerance notions can be scaled to an individual hospital and even an individual service. If adopted for daily routine use, risk tolerances for categories 1 and 2 might change or be subject to local customs. We did not consider patient or lay perspectives, but again, the variables of the proposed device can be modified in those settings that wish to consider such views. Also, simulations used here might not represent reality, but most disaster planning is based on simulated exercises due to an absence of empirical data. Furthermore, other systems have been developed on the basis of clinical judgment, in the absence of empirical data. One example is the Abbreviated Injury Scale,40, 41 which was originally based on clinical-judgment ratings, and has subsequently been shown to be both valid and reliable in measuring injury severity. More recently, Hick and O'Laughlin,42 using a less structured consensus format, developed an ethical framework for the distribution of scarce intensive-care-unit resources during disasters.",
