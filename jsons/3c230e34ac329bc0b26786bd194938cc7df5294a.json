With the drastic increasing number of the positive cases 25 around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the importance in the 26 assessment of the risk of spread and understanding genetic modification that could have 27 occurred in the SARS-CoV-2 (www.coronavirus.gov). Hence it is worthwhile to look for any 28 mutations or SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 alone that could the cause for the constant change and 29 virulence causing increase in continuing mortality and morbidity.",

The overall mutations phylogeny shows the 3 groups (https://www.gisaid.org/) of 45 mutations which are evolved in these 3 months. Predominantly, the mutations were also found 46 in the different vital proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike glycoprotein, Nsp1, RdRp and others) 47 (Fig. S1 and S2) and warrants epidemiologists and medical fraternity for the use of drug 48 treatment options. This also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is highly venerable to have quick 49 changes and mutate even during the person-to-person transmission. This also helps to 50 overcome the previous misconception of SARS-CoV-2 may not get mutated during person-51 to-person transmission [4]. The rate and number of SNPs or mutations in SARS-CoV-2 within 52 three months of outbreak underlines the complexity of virus to handle and corroborate the quick 53 evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S3). 54 55 We next looked at individual mutations that occurred in the three different prime 56 proteins (i) outer membrane spike glycoprotein, (ii) Non-structural protein (Nsp1) and (iii) 57 RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) [5-8] (Fig. 1B-D). Foremost in spike glycoprotein, 58 the mutations or SNPs occurred are surface exposed and in the solvent-accessible regions some 59 involved in the host receptor (ACE3 and CD26) binding and Furin cleavage site (Fig. S1C and 60 D) [5, 6, 9]. These mutations could make the virus more resistant to receptor binding inhibitors 61 and some of the antibodies. These warrants epidemiologists, medical fraternity and 62 pharmacologists to use the antivirals and antibodies which are compatible and promising to 63 their strain of SARS-CoV-2 and not to be generalised in some cases. Furthermore, we also 64 noticed a number of mutations or SNPs in other key proteins Nsp1 and RdRp (Fig. 1B and S1A65 and S2). Interestingly, most mutations were also surface exposed and show the high possibility 66 to impede the antiviral drugs.",
