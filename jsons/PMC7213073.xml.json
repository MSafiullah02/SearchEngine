New therapeutic options are needed now but are limited by a lack of evidence and require time to develop. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals provides an immediate treatment opportunity. While there is no licensed treatment that specifically acts against COVID-19, medications such as broad-spectrum antivirals are being employed as experimental adjuncts to supportive care [1]. Potential drugs that may be repurposed include antimalarial hydroxychloroquine, antiretrovirals lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir, and influenza drugs oseltamivir, remdesivir and favipiravir [2\u20134]. These drugs are now being trialled globally in different combinations for the treatment of COVID-19. Because of the pandemic status of COVID-19, detailed safety analysis and access to generic treatment production are vital.",

Doses equivalent to proposed human regimens were tested in animal models and demonstrated delayed development or embryonic death in the first trimester in four separate animal species [14]. Given this potential AE, no human study has included pregnant or lactating women; therefore this review could provide no further analysis on the issue. Participants in existing trials were required to avoid unprotected sexual intercourse for 90 days from the end of phase 3 studies. Despite these precautions, seven subjects became pregnant during this period, but limited fetal outcome information is available for those pregnancies. To assess the drug's effect on testicular function, a safety study (US105) was carried out and no adverse effect on sperm count or motility could be demonstrated [14].",

Other drugs designed for infectious diseases with pandemic potential, such as oseltamivir or zanamivir for influenza, typically have relatively little safety information at licensing. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) assessment report for zanamivir contained safety data from only 611 phase 2/3 trial participants [22]. Similarly, oseltamivir was approved by the EMA with data from only 1504 trial participants [23]. However, in contrast to current knowledge of favipiravir, data were available on oseltamivir as prophylaxis in 1230 participants [23]. Furthermore, although oseltamivir was shown to cross the placenta at higher doses in animal models, there was no evidence of animal or human teratogenicity prior to licensing, with 115 pregnancy outcomes available in the Roche database [24]. Exemplifying the limited safety data on favipiravir, the WHO VigiAccess tool for AE reporting contains only 11 records despite favipiravir having been licensed in Japan since 2014 [25].",
