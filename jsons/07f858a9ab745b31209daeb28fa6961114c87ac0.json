For example, Greenstone and Nigam (2020) (building on Ferguson et al., 2020) estimate that 630,000 lives in the US could be saved by social distancing policies assuring that intensive care units are not overwhelmed during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, slowing down disease transmission appear to cause large economic costs due to a fall in both consumption and production. Fernandes (2020) estimates the costs of the Covid-19 outbreak for 30 countries under different scenarios, and finds a median decline in GDP in 2020 of 2.8 percent, but that GDP can fall by more than 10-15 percent in some scenarios. Many have therefore concluded that the Covid-19 outbreak involves a key tradeoff: a higher spread-intensity is advantageous for economic activity, but disadvantageous for population health.",

In contrast to most previous work, we simplify the epidemiological model by only allowing two states: individuals are either susceptible or infected. This modelling choice implies that the whole population is eventually infected and that there is no death or recovery from the infection. 1 This is overly simplistic for studying disease transmission more generally, but we believe it can be an useful simplification when integrating epidemiological and economic models. In particular, our model allows the social planner to influence how quickly the infection spreads, and therefore also the economic activity and population health, by choosing a single parameter. A lower spread-intensity increases economic activity, but harms population health if the number of infected at the peak of the epidemic exceeds health care capacity.",

The same conclusion holds if the social planner is also concerned about upholding economic activity, but production is not affected by how quickly the disease is spreading. In more realistic scenarios where the social planner attaches a positive weight on economic activity and it is more harmful for the economy to be locked down for longer than shorter time periods (e.g., because social distancing policies are more harmful for the economy the longer time they are enforced), the optimal policy is to (weakly) exceed health care capacity during the some time of the epidemic.",

The trade-off between economic activity and population health would arise also in more elaborate models, but the finding that it is optimal to (weakly) exceed health care capacity is more sensitive to modelling assumptions. There are several possible reasons why a slower spread of the disease (a flatter curve) below the health care capacity constraint may be optimal in a richer model. For example, if patients recover from the disease and develop immunity (as in a SIR-model), a slower spread of the desease may limit the share of the population that is eventually infected. A slower spread may also be optimal if population health is negatively affected when more individuals are simultaneously infected also below the health care capacity constraint. Finally, the possibility that a vaccine or better medical treatments becomes available provides additional incentives to delay the epidemic.",

In the context of our model, it would be beneficial to develop policies and technologies that can lower spread intensity while harming production less, perhaps using testing (e.g. Berger et al., 2020) . Another potential mechanism is that high disease transmission may reduce economic activity because people spontaneously limit consumption and reduce labor supply in fear of being infected also in the absence of a policy response (Fenichel, 2013; Atkeson, 2020; Eichenbaum et al., 2020) . Finally, because we do not explicitly incorporate mortality in our model, one apparent mechanism that dampens the tradeoff is that high mortality reduces population size and thereby production. However, we believe this latter channel to be of minor importance in the context of Covid-19 due to relatively low mortality during productive years.",

(2020) , that combine the canonical epidemiological SIR-model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) with macroeconomic models to analyze how policymakers should optimally respond to a pandemic while taking both economic activity and population health into account. For example, Eichenbaum et al. (2020) assumes that social distancing reduces consumption and labor supply, which limits spread of the disease and reduce economic activity. Social distancing hence exacerbate the recession but raise welfare by reducing the number of pandemic-related deaths. Eichenbaum et al. (2020) solve the model numerically and calibrate it to the Covid-19 pandemic and find that it is optimal to introduce large-scale containment measures even if they result in a sharp (and sustained) output drop. Several other papers using similar modelling approaches calibrated to the Covid-19 pandemic also conclude that drastic front-loaded policies are optimal (Alvarez et al., 2020; Gonzalez-Eiras and Niepelt, 2020; Jones et al., 2020) .",

To complete the proof, we need only to demonstrate that the welfare equals T \u2212 \u03bb(x(T ) \u2212 x(0)) for any b > b * . But if b > b * , the capacity is never exceeded so the welfare function is given by equation (12) for g(b) = 1 and g (b) = 0, i.e., W (b) = T \u2212 \u03bb(x(T ) \u2212 x(0)) for all b > b * , which concludes the proof.",
