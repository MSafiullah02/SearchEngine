The strong mitigation and timely implementation of lockdown are of paramount importance to halt public movements and thereby prevent an upsurge in the disease counts.",

Neurosurgery also has been left crippled by this pandemic. Most of the elective surgeries have already been canceled. Although the incidence of road traffic accidents might have decreased, owing to the lockdown, the neurosurgeons still need to plan emergent care for patients with cardiovascular accidents, acute hydrocephalus, and tumors with impending herniation. Moreover, all of their patients are at risk for finding available beds in intensive care units, and for those in the intensive rehabilitation unit, the discharge from hospital is almost difficult. The study from Italy has provided a framework for creating an emergency task force and creating focused treatment hubs. 9 They have implemented transfer of needful patients into these hubs either primarily or through secondary transport from the peripheral spokes. Most of the urgent neurosurgical procedures can be performed by a strict number of operators. The clinical situations defined as neurosurgical emergencies are cerebral hemorrhage, acute hydrocephalus, brain tumor with a forthcoming risk of intracranial hypertension, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, and spinal cord compression. 9 Also, a direct neurosurgical involvement in the management of infected patients cannot be excluded because of the recent evidence of acute brain hemorrhage observed in patients with COVID-19. 10 Another aspect to be of concern in neurosurgery is pertaining to the continuation of residency programs. To date, most of the academic educational activities have been halted and residents from various specialties, including neurosurgery, have been reassigned to the new COVID wards. In this unforeseeable scenario, remote education, telementoring, virtual teaching, cloud learning, and virtual rounds are valuable alternative models for continuing education and preventing the sense of isolation and depression that is sweeping over the weeks.",
