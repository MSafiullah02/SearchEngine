            "text": "Healthcare workers are at the frontline when treating infectious disease cases and at high risk of acquiring influenza and other respiratory infections [1], [2], [3]. Several outbreaks of new infectious diseases have occurred in recent decades, such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002\u20132003 [4], influenza pandemic (H1N1) in 2009 [5], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [6] and Ebola virus diseases in 2014\u20132016 [7]. Many healthcare workers were infected and died during these outbreaks because of a lack of infection control [4], [8], [9], [10] Various infection control strategies are used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory and other infections in healthcare settings [11], [12]. These strategies can be broadly classified as administrative control measures, environmental control measures and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Administrative control measures include developing policies and procedures, implementing triage protocols and providing health education and trainings. Environmental control measures includes ensuring proper ventilation, establishing airborne infection isolation and negative pressure rooms, developing systems for cleaning and waste disposal. [13], [14]. PPE is commonly used in healthcare settings as standard or transmission based precaution to protect healthcare workers from infections and to prevent further spread to patients around them [14], [15].",

            "text": "PPE is generally ranked lowest in the infection control hierarchy due to less effectiveness compared to other control measures and high expenditure in the long run. Therefore, most infection control guidelines recommend using PPE together with other administrative and environmental control measures. However, PPE is important during the early stage of an outbreak or a pandemic when drugs, a vaccine and other control measures are not available, or access is limited. Commonly used PPE to protect from respiratory infectionsare; face masks, respirators, gloves, and goggles or face shields [16]. Face masks (or medical masks) and respirators are the most commonly used PPE to protect from influenza and other respiratory infection in healthcare settings. However, these two products are not the same. Face masks are not designed for respiratory protection and are used to avoid respiratory droplet and spray of body fluids on the face. They are also used by sick patients to prevent spread of pathogens to others (referred to as \u201csource control\u201d), or by surgeons in the operating theatre to maintain a sterile operating field. Face masks are not fit to the face and have varying filtration capacities [17]. Respirators are designed for respiratory protection and are used to protect from respiratory aerosols [18]. A properly fitted respirator provides better protection again respiratory infections than a face mask. Gloves are used to protect hands from blood and body fluids, including respiratory secretions. Goggles and face shields are used to prevent transfer of respiratory pathogens into the eyes from contaminated hands and other sources. Gowns, coveralls, surgical hoods and shoe covers can also be used where procedures on infectious patients generate aerosols or when a new respiratory virus has emerged [18].",

Most studies are observational and on the use of masks and/or respirators [18]. To date, only five randomized clinical trials have been conducted on use of PPE in hospital settings and all were on face masks/respirators [18]. Moreover, most studies on PPE use were conducted in high/middle income countries and currently there are limited data from low-income countries where the burden of infectious diseases is high. It is therefore important to examine the use of PPE in low resource countries to inform infection control policies.",

A study in a ward for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis reported that 65% of the healthcare workers used N95 respirators and 58% were provided with a mask [20]. A study on 253 biosafety level (BSL) 2 laboratory workers showed that PPE was not used by about half of the staff (46.2%) [27]. A countrywide survey showed that almost one third (31.9%) of BSL-2 laboratory workers did not routinely use PPE [26]. Both gloves and laboratory coats were used by only 26.7% of the personnel, while a laboratory coat or gloves alone were used by 30.4% and 8.1%, respectively. Less than 1% of all the respondents across Pakistan reported using eye covers [26]. In a survey of medical students during pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 75% said that they would use a face mask to protect from infection. Students with less risk perception were more hesitant to use face masks [24]. The use of face masks was common in dental practice and according to various surveys, 68\u2013100% of dentists wear masks during dental procedures [28], [29], [30], [31]. Across all the studies in dental settings, more than 90% also used gloves. Among the PPE, face masks were considered the most bothersome to use by wearers.",

The different policies and practices may be because of the different recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [33], [34]. Debate continues about the selection and use PPE for different infections, for example, face masks versus respirators, gowns versus coveralls, face shields versus goggles [7], [18], [34], [35]. Selection of PPE mainly depends on mode of transmission, however, several individual and organizational factors also contribute the selection and use of PPE, such as risk perception, presence of adverse events, pre-existing medical illness, availability and cost [7]. Respiratory infections are generally transmitted through contact, droplet and/or airborne routes. Gloves should be used to protect from infections transmitted through contact (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus), face masks should be used for droplet infections (e.g. influenza and coronavirus) and a respirator should be used to protect form airborne infection (e.g. tuberculosis and measles). However, infection transmission is rarely by only one route and most infections are transmitted by more than one route [36]. For example, influenza and SARS primarily transmit through droplet and contact routes, but airborne transmission has also been reported [37], [38]. Similarly, Ebola primarily transmits through direct contact with blood and body fluids [39], but animal studies have shown that airborne transmission is also possible [7]. The risk of transmission further increases during aerosol-generating and other high-risk procedures [40], [41]. Moreover, uncertainty exists about how pathogens transmit during outbreaks and pandemics [14], [34], [42], [43]. Therefore, superior PPE should be used where the mode of transmission is uncertain, the case-fatality rate is high and pharmaceutical interventions are not available [7]. Infection control guidelines in Pakistan need to be updated urgently to reflect these recommendations. Given that MERS CoV is circulating in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), policies and practices on the use of PPE in other countries of the region should also be examined.",

The availability of PPE is a challenge, not only in low-resource counties, but also in high-income countries, particularly during outbreaks and pandemics when the use of PPE greatly increases [46], [47]. This may result in non-standard practices such as reuse and extended use of PPE. Shortages of PPE were even reported in many high-income countries during the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic and staff had to use various alternatives [46], [47], [48]. The availability of PPE is important to ensure proper use and compliance. Low use of PPE among laboratory workers in Pakistan may be due to non-availability and a lack of resources. For example, PPE use was relatively higher in laboratory workers in Punjab, which is an affluent province, than other provinces [26]. Moreover PPE use was reported more in the private sector in Pakistan than the public sector which has fewer resources [27]. Proper use of PPE depends on several factors such as availability, knowledge, training, risk perception and comfort [7], [44], [45].",

While the use PPE depends on many factors, a greater perception of risk was positively associated with compliance [24]. Continuous use of face masks and respirators may have psychological and physiological effects on the wearer and result in more adverse events [49], [50], [51]. Compliance with the use of face masks has been shown to be based on the nature of the disease, infectiousness of patients and the performance of high-risk procedures [52]. Previous studies have tested the PRECEDE (predisposing, reinforcing and enabling) framework to examine healthcare workers\u2019 compliance with universal precautions [53]. The results showed that reinforcing factors, such as availability of PPE and less job hindrance, and enabling factors, such as safety climate and regular feedback, were significant predictors of compliance with PPE [53]. In addition, the health belief model [54] was also used to examine the compliance and use of face mask during the SARS outbreak [55], [56]. Perceived susceptibility (vulnerability to acquiring SARS and close contact with case), perceived benefits (that face masks can prevent infection) and cues to action (someone asked them to use face masks) were significant predictors of protective behaviour and use of face masks [55].",
