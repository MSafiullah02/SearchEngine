The most globally accepted definitions of at-risk patients rely, primarily, on epidemiological characterization of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, such characterization overlooks, and fails to correct for, the prevalence of existing conditions in the wider SARS-CoV-2 positive population. Here, we use the complete medical records of 4,353 Israeli SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, of whom 173 experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, to identify the conditions that increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications, as previously reported. Interestingly, it also indicates that depression (e.g., odds ratio, OR, for males 65 years or older: 2.94, 95% confidence intervals [1.55, 5.58]; P-value = 0.014) as well cognitive and neurological disorder (e.g., OR for individuals \u2265 65 year old: 2.65 [1.69, 4.17]; P-value < 0.001) are significant risk factors; and that smoking and background of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment efforts.",

This pandemic poses grave challenges to patients, healthcare providers, and policy makers. Many of these challenges may be better addressed with timely stratification of patients to risk groups, based on their past and current medical characteristics. For example, reliably identifying patients at increased (or decreased) risk could guide clinical decisions (e.g., hospitalization vs home care), public health policies (e.g., risk-based quarantine), and preparedness efforts (e.g., expected medical equipment required).",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified individuals 65 years and older, living at nursing home or long-term care facility, or suffering from underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, as being at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 [3] . Similarly, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) lists age above 70 years and some underlying conditions as risk factors for critical illness [4] . The United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) included solid organ transplant recipients, patient with specific cancers or severe respiratory conditions, pregnant women with significant heart disease, and those with increased risk of infection (e.g., due to immunosuppression therapies) in the highest clinical COVID-19 risk group [5] . On April 2020 approximately 1.3 million people in this group were asked to \"shield\" by staying at home for a period of at least 12 weeks. In addition, patients over 70 years and those suffering from some underlying health conditions (e.g., chronic respiratory diseases, BMI \u2265 40, and pregnant women) were considered in a wider vulnerable group (also referred to as the \"flu group\"). Finally, a more quantitative risk model has been adopted by the Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH), assigning a point for each underlying condition from a predefined list, then considering age group and point count to identify high risk patients.",

Unlike these studies, we compare here the prevalence of existing conditions in SARS-CoV-2 positive and complicated COVID-19 patients and identify those associated with COVID-19 complications in various age and sex strata.

We do, however, identify a few additional risk factors, notably depression in patients 18-50 years old and males 65 years or more; and cognitive and neurological disorders in patients 65 years or older. These additions may be, in part, associated with different age distribution in the 65+ years group (median 76y, IQR [70-83.5y] versus 72y [68-78y] in the complicated and non-complicated COVID-19 cohorts, respectively) and rely on small sample size (only seven 18-50y patients with depression in the complicated COVID-19 cohort; Table 3 ); nonetheless, they may deserve more consideration in future studies. Our analysis also points out to reduced importance of respiratory diseases and smoking. Both conditions appear as factors in most at-risk definitions [3, 5] : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been associated with severe COVID-19 in multiple (though not all [6] ) studies [18] , while the role of smoking has been somewhat controversial [18, 19] . The discrepancies between our analysis and previous reports likely stem from the different cohorts analyzed: SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, ranging from asymptomatic to severe COVID-19 versus hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively.",

For example, DeCapprio et al [19] trained models on US Medicare claims data to predict inpatient visits with a primary diagnosis of either pneumonia, influenza, acute bronchitis, or other specified upper respiratory infections as proxy for COVID-19 complications. However, as previously reported (e.g., in [22] ), and in agreement with our analysis, severe COVID-19 patient characteristics differ considerably from other diseases', thus undermining the generalizability of such models to COVID-19.",

Third, asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients (currently in the non-complicated cohort) may deteriorate and eventually be part of the complicated cohort, potentially modifying the results of the analysis. Fourth, our analysis is univariate in nature, testing the association of individual conditions with COVID-19 complications; as such, it is unable to uncover more complex relations, e.g., interdependencies between conditions and COVID-19 complications. Finally, we focused on data from Israel; characteristics in other geographies may differ [22] .
