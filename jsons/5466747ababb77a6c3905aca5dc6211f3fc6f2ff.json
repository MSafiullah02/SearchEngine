The major objective is to introduce genetic material into cancer cells with the intent of sensitizing them to chemo-and radiation therapy. A number of strategies have now reached phases I and II clinical trials, with some showing promise. In addition, using molecular tools and engineering, a major thrust in the field is to image affected cancer cells and their fate during therapy, for example by positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Occasionally, this can be achieved by the conversion of an image probe by the therapeutic protein itself resulting in an imageable feature and sometimes a co-expressed protein can accomplish this.

One overriding technical diffi-culty shared by all gene therapy vectors is the relative inefficient delivery of DNA into the tumor. All tumor cells need to be affected or the cancer would recur. Virus vectors including adenovirus (ADV), adeno-associated virus (AAV), and retrovirus (RV) have traditionally been the vectors of choice for introducing genetic material (e.g., suppressor genes, dominant-negative genes, and \"suicide genes\") into cancer cells to make them more sensitive to chemo-and radiation therapy. Viruses have evolved highly effective mechanisms for infecting cells, on which has been capitalized. However, each vector has its pros and cons (Table 18 .1). By molecular engineering, these viruses have been altered to accommodate the therapeutic gene and at the same time allow for efficient growth and safe handling.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 62, "end": 76, "text": "(Valerie 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 738, "end": 747, "text": "(Table 18", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Vectors"}, {"text": "A significant problem using viral vectors for cancer gene therapy are production and quality control issues, safety, and cost associated with obtaining clinical grade preparations suitable for human use. In terms of the efficiency of delivery, ADV remains the most effective viral vector because of the ability to obtain high titers and higher multiplicities of infection ([MOI] i.e., virus per cell ratio) than other viral vectors, and the relative ease by which large quantities of virus can be isolated and purified (Table 18 .1). Retrovirus, and more recently lentivirus (LV), remain promising vectors. However, whereas ADV is not typically integrated into the genome of infected cells, both RV and LV integrate and potentially could be a safety concern due to the possibility that a critical cellular gene is inactivated by insertion of the virus. Because of these advantageous properties, ADV is considered a more suitable vector for cancer therapy than RV and LV. However, the efficient delivery of viruses into the tumor is still a major problem despite viruses' ability of infecting cells in culture at high levels. The effective delivery of virus or by any other means (physical or chemical) within the tumor bed remains a major technical hurdle (Freytag et al. 2004) . Penetration of ADV within tissue rarely exceeds a volume larger than a cubic centimeter , thus limiting potential success only to small tumors. AAV has also been considered as a vector for cancer therapy (Li et al. 2005b ). However, even though AAV supposedly is integrating at a specific chromosomal site, potentially avoiding mutagenesis, production issues and relatively low expression levels of therapeutic genes from AAV vectors are shared with RV and LV (Table  18.1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 372, "end": 378, "text": "([MOI]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1277, "text": "(Freytag et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1500, "text": "(Li et al. 2005b", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 519, "end": 528, "text": "(Table 18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1753, "text": "(Table  18.1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Vectors"}, {"text": "Some studies have attempted direct injection of DNA into tumors, either alone or in complex with lipids.

Attempts to incorporate molecules in the lipid bilayer that bind to cell surface receptor to improve cell specificity have been investigated, but the differential effects seen in vitro are not generally duplicated in vivo.

Furthermore, wild-type AAV does not cause any known disease and does not stimulate a cell-mediated immune response. In order for AAV to propagate, it requires a helper virus such as ADV. The relatively small genome size of 4.7-kb only allows smaller therapeutic genes to be transferred. Similar to ADV, attempts to change the cell tropism for AAV infection have been successful in vitro, but these approaches have not yet been fully tested in vivo.

The typical LV used for gene therapy is a human retrovirus derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) that is highly efficient in infecting cells. In contrast to the mouse retrovirus, human LV infects nondividing cells in addition to dividing cells, which makes this vector very attractive for somatic cell gene therapy and in vitro work.

Entirely manmade DNA/RNA and lipids needed for human use would provide excellent scaleup capabilities, quality control, and increased safety, similar to the manufacturing of small molecule cancer drugs.

The basic idea is for this ADV to replicate only in cancer cells but not in normal cells, due to a mutation in a specific viral gene, E1B, that renders ADV replication dependent on mutant or abnormal p53, a condition found in about half of all cancers. When ONYX-015 infects a p53 mutant cancer cell, it subsequently lyses or breaks open the cell and releases new ADV available for infection of additional cancer cells, thus the name oncolytic. The tumor suppressor p53 was initially believed to make the decision whether replication occurred or not-mutant p53 allowed the oncolytic virus to replicate whereas wild type did not. Since normal somatic cells express wild-type p53 they would not allow the ADV to replicate and thus would be spared. However, it turns out that other p53-related processes and modulators of cell cycle checkpoints in-cluding p14 arf /p16 InK4a may also play important roles in whether the oncolytic ADV replicates or not. Nevertheless, oncolytic ADV showed some positive initial clinical results, but it is not a magic bullet for cancer.

The incredible specificity inherent in RNAi is derived from its basic mechanism of action, whereby the small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule hybridizes specifically with its cognate messenger RNA, resulting in degradation of the mRNA. This endogenous silencing mechanism, found in all multicellular organisms, can be exploited to achieve silencing of specific genes by introduction of synthetic siRNA molecules predesigned to hybridize to target genes ( Fig. 18.1) . These siRNA molecules also hold significant promise for gene therapy approaches. (For a recent review of siRNA biogenesis and the mechanism of inhibition by RNAi, see Liu et al. 2008 ). In addition to extracellularly introduced siRNA, there exists another class of small RNA molecules, termed micro-RNA (miRNA), which is encoded by the genome of an organism. miRNA represent the most abundant class of naturally occurring small RNAs but differ from siRNA in their origins. Unlike siRNA, miRNA is initially transcribed as part of a much longer primary transcript and then processed to liberate a hairpin precursor of ~65 nucleotides in the nucleus (Liu et al. 2008 ). This precursor is then exported to the cytoplasm where it is processed by the enzyme Dicer to produce a ~22-bp RNA duplex. Thus, at this point, miRNA and siRNA is similar and both enter a common pathway in which one strand of the RNA duplex becomes incorporated into a protein complex known as RISC (for RNA-induced silencing complex). The function of RISC is to guide the interaction between the siRNA or miRNA and the mRNA and catalyze either the degradation of the mRNA or inhibit its translation ( Fig. 18.1 ) (Hutvagner and Simard 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 146, "text": "(Kim 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 797, "end": 812, "text": "Liu et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1293, "text": "(Liu et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1838, "text": "(Hutvagner and Simard 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 159, "text": "(Fig.  18.1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 617, "end": 627, "text": "Fig. 18.1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1799, "end": 1808, "text": "Fig. 18.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "RnA Interference"}, {"text": "Once the basic mechanism of RNAi was uncovered, it was clear that siRNA could be introduced into cells to silence the expression of specific genes.

Indeed, miRNA has been found to control a wide range of biological processes, including development, metabolism, cell growth, cell death, and cell fate determination (Ambros 2004) , and altered expression of miRNA has been associated with human diseases including cancer (Hammond 2006) . One strategy to inhibit the function of miRNA is the use of antagomirs, which hybridize to miRNA and prevent its incorporation into RISC (Mattes et al. 2007) (Fig. 18.1 ).

ADV was readily detected in the pancreas but not in other tissues, suggesting that this ADV can be combined with radiotherapy of the pancreas without resulting in excessive systemic toxicity. Currently, this novel ADV is undergoing a phase I trial in patients with pancreatic cancer. Other studies have tested the feasibility of using 8-[ 18 F]fluoroganciclovir (FGCV) as probe for imaging HSV-TK-expressing cells and tissues in preclinical animal models using microPET with similar positive results (Lu et al. 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 468, "end": 490, "text": "(Freytag et al. 2007a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 993, "end": 1009, "text": "(Lu et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Applications Related to Radiotherapy and Imaging"}, {"text": "Most times the therapeutic protein itself is not imageable. In this case, a second protein needs to be expressed that can be imaged, ideally with clinically suitable imaging technologies such as PET or MRI. The vector for such studies is usually limited to ADV or any other viral vector able to harbor larger DNA inserts. One example of this strategy is using the same double suicide gene prodrug with conditionally replicating ADV as mentioned above and co-expressing the human iodide symporter (hNIS) gene as a reporter for singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT) (Sid-diqui et al. 2007 ). hNIS will sequester the probe sodium pertechnetate (Na 99m TcO 4 ) to affected tissues, in this case the prostate (SIDDIQUI et al. 2007 ). Na 99m TcO 4 is an US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved diagnostic imaging probe. It was found that SPECT images were readily detected up to 4 days after administering the ADV. Currently, such ADV is undergoing clinical testing. The ability to image the expression of the therapeutic gene increases the information gained from clinical trials tremendously. In the future, more, novel ways of imaging tumors by PET, MRI, or other clinically utilized imaging technologies of patients undergoing gene therapy, will likely continue to facilitate the assessment of vector penetration and treatment efficacy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 576, "end": 598, "text": "(Sid-diqui et al. 2007", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 716, "end": 737, "text": "(SIDDIQUI et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Applications Related to Radiotherapy and Imaging"}, {"text": "The idea of using cancer gene therapy to improve chemoand radiotherapy was initially very exciting. Promising results were generated in various animal tumor models. However, clinical trials have so far shown little to no impact on patient survival, with a range of different types of cancers. Almost 20 years later, the field is still trying to deal with technical issues. Regardless of therapeutic strategy, the efficient delivery of therapeutic DNA or RNA into tumors needs to improve. RNAi-based strategies look very promising and so does the nanoparticles because of this vector's added benefit of being able to image the targeted cells and tissues. It is very likely that many of these technical hurdles will be overcome in the future, resulting in improved clinical outcome.
