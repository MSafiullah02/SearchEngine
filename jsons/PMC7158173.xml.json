For example, a cat may be in proper physical condition and free from infectious or other physical disease, yet suffering from severe stress and anxiety. In this case, the patient cannot be assessed as healthy, because its behavioral (emotional) state is compromising its health and well-being. Thus physical health and behavioral health are both essential components of wellness, and preventive health care must actively address each of these.",

Even the best-designed facilities cannot favor good health in a multicat environment without thoughtful implementation of environmental wellness protocols. In small animal practice, environmental wellness is frequently not emphasized simply because many owners are accustomed to providing a reasonably healthy environment for their pets. In contrast, a structured program to address environmental wellness is essential in the context of a population, regardless of the actual physical facility.

In the context of a breeding colony, the goals might include increasing kitten birth weights, decreasing neonatal mortality, or improving socialization of kittens. By identifying and tracking measurable factors (often called performance targets in large animal medicine), it is possible to measure progress toward these goals.

Rounds should be conducted at least once daily (preferably twice a day or more often, depending upon the needs of individual cats) for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating both physical and behavioral health. Medically trained caregivers should visually observe every animal and its environment, taking note of food and water consumption, urination, defecation, attitude, behavior, ambulation, and signs of illness, pain or other problems. Monitoring should take place before cleaning so that food intake and the condition of the enclosure, including the presence of feces, urine, or vomit can be noted. Alternatively, observation logs can be completed by caregivers at the time of cleaning and reviewed during walk-though rounds. Any cat that is observed to be experiencing a problem, whether it be signs of respiratory infection, diarrhea, anxiety, or obvious pain, suffering, or distress must be assessed and treated in a timely manner.

Feline herpes virus type 1 (FHV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV) have been implicated as the causes of most infections: Both viruses induce persistent carrier states and are widespread in the cat population.36 Cats that recover from FHV-1 remain latently infected and shed virus intermittently, especially following periods of stress. FCV carriers shed continuously for months to years following infection. A variety of other viral and bacterial pathogens may also contribute to feline upper respiratory disease, and Bordetella, Chlamydophila, and Mycoplasma are problematic in some populations. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is another disease that is nearly impossible to eradicate from a multicat environment, and sporadic cases can be expected to occur, especially in young cats.93 Fortunately, proper wellness programs can greatly limit the incidence and severity of diseases, even for pathogens that are difficult to control.",

Because of their unique biology, cats are particularly prone to experiencing acute stress and fear in novel environments. Anything unfamiliar to a cat can trigger apprehension, activating the stress response. Confinement in a novel environment can result in a wide variety of behavioral indicators of stress including hypervigilance, feigned sleep, constant hiding, activity depression, and loss of appetite, among others. In the long term, if cats are unable to acclimate or cope in their environments, chronic stress, fear, frustration, or learned helplessness may result. In group settings, signs of social stress may also manifest with increases in problem behaviors, including urine marking, spraying, or other inappropriate elimination; constant hiding; and/or aggression.46 Stress not only has the potential to negatively impact behavioral health but also physical health as well. The intimate link between stress and immunity has been well described. In fact, stress is a leading factor in the development of infectious disease and is particularly important in the pathogenesis of feline upper respiratory infections.37, 47 Wellness programs that reduce stress will also serve to minimize the morbidity of infectious disease.",

The procedure is well tolerated by the vast majority of cats without the need for sedation. Unlike visual means of identification, a scanner is necessary for positive identification of a microchipped animal. For this reason, microchips are often used in conjunction with a visual means of identification and serve as important permanent means of backup identification. Box 46-3\ndescribes the proper technique for scanning for a microchip.BOX 46-3Microchip Scanning TechniqueEvery cat, including those surrendered by their owners, should be systematically scanned for the presence of a microchip at the time of intake, as well as prior to being made available for adoption or being euthanized. Proper technique and scanning more than once are crucial to avoid missing microchips.67, 68 A universal (global) scanner (e.g., one that will read all microchip frequencies that are currently in use) should be used to ensure that all microchip frequencies are detected. At this time, the only universal scanners available in the United States are the new Home Again Global World scanner (Schering Plough, Whitehouse Station, NY) and the iMax Black Label ResQ scanner (Bayer Animal Health, Shawnee Mission, Kans.). One of the most common causes of scanner failure is weak batteries; therefore it is imperative that batteries be checked and replaced regularly.To ensure a thorough scan and avoid missing chips, cats must be removed from carriers or cages prior to scanning. Metal and fluorescent lighting may interfere with chip detection. Metal exam surfaces should be covered with a towel or other material prior to scanning to minimize interference. The entire animal should be scanned using a consistent speed, scanner orientation, scanning pattern, and distance.\u2022Scanner orientation: The scanner should be held parallel to the animal. Rocking the scanner slightly from side to side will maximize the potential for optimal chip orientation and successful detection. The button on the scanner should be depressed continuously during the entire scanning procedure.\u2022Scanning distance: The scanner should be held in contact with the animal during scanning such that it is lightly touching the hair coat.\u2022Scanner speed: The scanner should not be advanced any faster than 0.15 m/second (0.5 ft/second). Scanning slowly is crucial, because universal scanners must cycle through various modes to read all possible chip frequencies.\u2022Areas of animal to scan: The standard implant site is midway between the shoulder blades, and scanning should begin over this area. If a microchip is not detected here, scanning should proceed systematically down the back, on the sides, neck, and shoulders\u2014all the way to the elbows in the front and the hindquarters in the rear.\u2022Scanning pattern: The scanner should be moved over the scanning areas in an \u201cS\u201d-shaped pattern in a transverse direction (from side to side). If no microchip is detected, the scanner should be rotated 90 degrees, and then the \u201cS\u201d-shaped pattern should be repeated in a longitudinal direction (e.g., the long way) on both sides of the animal. This pattern of scanning will maximize the ability of the scanner to detect the microchip, regardless of its orientation.\n",

Because some scanners read only certain radiofrequencies, it is possible to miss detecting a microchip that is present, depending on the scanner being used. Currently, there are efforts to standardize microchipping in the United States, including widespread distribution of universal (global) scanners to ensure that all implanted microchips can be reliably identified. Once global scanners are widely available, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) recommends adoption of the 134-kHz (ISO) microchip as the American standard, because this frequency is recognized as the international standard for microchips in the rest of the world. Efforts have also focused on improving, updating, and centralizing microchip registries. This is extremely important in the context of animal shelters.

Such long-term confinement may compromise quality of life and may compound the emotional stress of caregivers who may later be faced with euthanizing cats that have been held for long periods awaiting confirmatory testing or adoption opportunities.

It is caused by infection of the skin, hair, and nails with microscopic fungal organisms that cause varying degrees of hair loss and dermatitis. The dermatophyte that causes the majority of cases in felines is Microsporum canis, which is responsible for greater than 96% of all cases.82 If left untreated, most infections will spontaneously resolve within 12 to 14 weeks postinfection. However, during this time, the infected cat will infect the surrounding environment and other animals or humans in the area. Not all cats infected with dermatophytosis develop lesions, and some may become chronic carriers. Control of dermatophytosis is difficult, because the spores formed by M. canis can survive in the environment for up to18 months or longer and are extremely resistant to disinfectants and detergents. In addition, the presence of asymptomatic carriers makes it difficult to readily recognize all infected cats. For this reason, consideration should be given to culturing all cats prior to entry to a closed colony. In particular, Persian cats may be predisposed to dermatophyte infection and can be particularly difficult to clear once infected. In closed colony settings, dermatophyte testing by culture is highly recommended unless the source of the cat excludes the possibility of infection (e.g., specific pathogen-free [SPF] cats, purpose-bred laboratory cats). To screen cats using cultures, samples should be collected using the McKenzie toothbrush method, where a new toothbrush is used to brush the cat's entire body, giving special attention to the face, ears, and limbs. In addition, if skin lesions are present, hair should be plucked around these areas for culture as well.",

Even injured cats, those with medical conditions, and those that are pregnant or lactating should be vaccinated on entry, because vaccination will likely be effective and the small risk of adverse effects is outweighed by the high risk of disease exposure and infection in the shelter.96 When vaccination of all cats on entry is not financially feasible, the next best practice is to vaccinate all those that are deemed adoptable at the time of entry or that are likely to be in the shelter long term.41 Whenever possible, vaccinated cats should be separated from those that will remain unvaccinated (e.g., those that will be euthanized following a brief holding period) as soon as that determination can be made.",

For this reason, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Companion Animal Parasite Council strongly advise routine administration of broad-spectrum anthelminthics for their control.17, 20 Pyrantel pamoate is one of the most cost-effective and efficacious drugs for treatment and control of roundworms and hookworms. In both shelter and cattery settings, the author recommends administration of pyrantel pamoate at a dosage of 10 mg/kg to all cats with re-treatment in 2 weeks and then at monthly intervals.41 In shelters, if it is not possible to treat all cats at the time of entry, at a minimum, all cats that are deemed adoptable should be treated as soon as possible. In addition, kittens should be treated at 2-week intervals until 4 months of age. For cats with diarrhea, fecal examination (e.g., flotation or centrifugation, direct fecal smear and cytology) should be performed with treatment according to results. Even if results are negative, the administration of broad-spectrum anthelminthics should be strongly considered.",

In animal shelters, spaying and neutering cats prior to adoption will ensure that they do not reproduce and contribute to the surplus of community cats. This will also serve to enhance husbandry, because the procedures rapidly decrease spraying, marking, and fighting; eliminate heat behavior and pregnancy; and greatly mitigate stress. In addition to reducing stress and odor, spaying and neutering sexually mature cats will facilitate group housing, which is often beneficial for cats, especially when housed longer term (see below). The medical benefits of spay/neuter have also been well described, including dramatic reductions in the risk of mammary carcinoma, elimination of cystic endometrial hyperplasia, pyometra and ovarian cancer in queens, and decreased risk of prostate disease in toms.55 Thus spaying and neutering favors both individual as well as population health.",

Major disadvantages include the fact that cats that are not eating may remain unrecognized for several days, especially when more than one animal is fed together, and some cats may choose to continually overeat and become obese. Free choice feeding is an excellent method for cats that require frequent food consumption. These include kittens up to 5 to 6 months of age, queens in late gestation, and those that are nursing. Unlike dogs, who are competitive eaters by nature, free choice feeding may benefit cats that are group housed, because it ensures that there will be ample time for all members to eat, provided that dominant members of the colony do not block the access of subordinate cats.49\n",

Meal feeding also has the benefit of enhancing caregiver\u2013cat bonding and provides a pleasant and predictable experience for cats when done on a regular daily schedule. Using a combination of free choice plus once daily meal feeding takes advantage of the positive aspects of both methods and works well for most cats in a population setting. Typically, dry food is available free choice, and a small meal of canned food is offered once daily. This combination approach accommodates the normal feeding behavior of cats by allowing them to eat several smaller meals throughout the day while allowing caregivers to monitor the cat's appetite at least for the canned food meal. As necessary for the individual cat, some may be fed additional meals of canned food to ensure adequate nutritional support.",

Matted hair coats are not only uncomfortable for the animal, but may lead to skin infection. Overgrown nails can also be a problem for some cats, particularly those that are geriatric or polydactyl. The provision of appropriate surfaces for scratching will encourage cats to condition their own claws; and a system for regular inspection of the hair coat and nails should be established. In addition to ensuring proper coat and nail maintenance, regular grooming sessions provide an excellent opportunity to monitor body condition; and some cats enjoy the physical contact and attention. In high-risk settings, the use of stainless steel combs or undercoat rakes that can be readily disinfected are generally preferable to the use of bristle brushes because the latter are impossible to disinfect and have the potential to spread common skin infections such as ringworm.",

Affiliative behaviors are those that facilitate close proximity or contact. Cats within groups commonly practice mutual grooming and allorubbing (e.g., rubbing heads and faces together). This may serve as a greeting or as an exchange of odor for recognition, familiarization, marking, or development of a communal scent.

Manifestations of both normal and abnormal behavior indicate how successfully an animal is coping with its environment. Common behavioral expressions of feline anxiety may manifest with inhibited or withdrawal behavior, defensive behavior or disruptive behavior.46, 90 Inhibited or withdrawal behavior refers to activity depression or the absence of normal behaviors (e.g., grooming, eating, sleeping, eliminating, stretching, greeting people). Defensive behavior may involve characteristic postural and/or vocal responses, and is usually motivated by fear. Disruptive behavior involves destruction of cage contents and creation of a hiding place. Stereotypic behaviors (e.g., repetitive pacing, pawing, and circling) may also develop as a result of stress but generally occur less commonly. As an illustration of these feline behaviors, consider the responses of a typical social domestic cat when caged in a novel environment (Box 46-7\nand FIGURE 46-12, FIGURE 46-13, FIGURE 46-14, FIGURE 46-15\n).BOX 46-7Typical Behavioral Responses of a Cat Caged in a Novel Environment46\n\u2022Fear is typically the initial response, and if threatened by the proximity of unfamiliar caregivers, defensive aggression may be displayed. Alternatively, the cat may freeze or appear catatonic.\u2022If provided with a box for concealment, the cat will hide or otherwise slink against the back of the enclosure, behind the litter box, or disrupt the cage and hide under the paper.\u2022Given time, most cats become more active and engage in greeting behaviors, coming to the front of the cage and pawing or mewing as caregivers approach.\u2022If the cat remains confined with time without adequate periods of exercise, mental stimulation, and social companionship, stress and frustration will manifest with activity depression and withdrawal (lying in the litter box, failure to groom, failure to greet caregivers, and, in some cases, displaying aggression towards caregivers).\u2022Displays of stereotypic behavior (such as pacing) may occur; however, inhibited or withdrawal behaviors are much more common (see FIGURE 46-12, FIGURE 46-13, FIGURE 46-14, FIGURE 46-15).\n",

Colony members commonly display aggression toward unfamiliar or new cats entering the group. Within an established group, however, most social conflicts are not characterized by overt aggression. Instead, the main mode of conflict resolution is avoidance or deference (Figure 46-16\n).9, 46, 90 Deference behaviors include looking away, lowering the ears slightly, turning the head away, and leaning backward. Large numbers of cats peacefully co-exist together, using such strategies for avoidance provided ample space and resources are available for all members of the group.10\n",

Current guidelines (European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes, ETS123) promulgated by the Council of Europe (http://www.coe.int) for laboratory cats are similar, but proposed revisions call for substantially more floor space for cats, at 1.5 m2 (16.7 ft2) per adult cat with a height of at least 2 m (6.5 ft).21, 22 The revisions, which have not been approved to date, also call for the provision of shelves, a box-style bed, and a vertical scratching surface. Animal shelter facilities in the United States have traditionally been equipped with small perchless cages (e.g., 0.5 to 0.75 m or 1.5 to 2.5 ft long) that are poorly designed for housing cats. The Association of Shelter Veterinarians (http://www.sheltervet.org) recommends a minimum enclosure size of 1 m2 (11 ft2) for adult cats.7 Commercially available cages are typically approximately 0.75 m (2.5 ft) deep (e.g., an arm-length deep so that they can be readily accessed); therefore a cage with a length of 1.2 m (4 ft) is required to provide this approximate square footage, and it will also allow for adequate separation of food, water, and litter (Figure 46-21\n). Similarly, the Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association (http://www.cfa.org) recommends a minimum of 0.85 m3 (30 ft3) of space per cat for those weighing 2 kg or more.16 Cubic measurements take into account the use of vertical space in addition to floor space, which is crucial for improving the quality of the environment. For example, a 0.85-m3 (30-ft3) enclosure would measure approximately 0.75 m deep \u00d7 1.2 m wide \u00d7 1 m high (2.5 ft deep \u00d7 4 ft wide \u00d7 3 ft high).",

For long-term housing, most cats will benefit from colony-style housing, provided there is sufficient space, easy access to feeding and elimination areas, an adequate number of comfortable hiding, and resting places and careful grouping and monitoring to ensure social compatibility among cats. Not every cat, however, will thrive in a group setting, and certain individuals will require enriched single housing, depending on their unique physical or behavioral needs. These may include cats that bully other cats or are otherwise incompatible and those with special medical needs. It is important to recognize that such singly housed cats will require more regular contact with their human caregivers and higher levels of mental and physical stimulation in order to maintain behavioral health during long-term confinement. Whenever possible, long-term housing of such individuals should be avoided. When cats are housed in amicable groups, it is easier to maintain proper behavioral welfare in the long term, because many of their social and emotional needs can be met by conspecifics.",

Because it can be behaviorally beneficial, it is desirable for them to remain with her for a longer period of time when this is feasible. In fact, queens frequently do not fully wean their kittens until 12 to 14 weeks of age if left to their own devices. If older kittens are housed with their mother, it is important to provide a perch that allows her the option of periodically resting away from them if desired. Most queens will accept the kittens of another cat; therefore young orphan or singleton kittens should be housed with other lactating queens and/or kittens of similar age/size. In a shelter setting where there is a high turnover of cats, it may be beneficial to house young kittens up to 4 to 5 months of age in large cages or condos for biosecurity purposes. Juveniles and adults can be housed in colony rooms or runs but should be segregated by age (e.g., juveniles 5 to 12 months old, young adults, mature adults, geriatrics). Well-socialized juveniles tend to adapt quickly in a group setting with other cats of similar ages and exhibit healthy activity and play behavior. In contrast, mature adults and geriatric cats often have little tolerance for the high energy and playful antics of many younger cats, which can cause them substantial stress. For this reason, adult cats should be kept separate from juvenile cats, and aging or geriatric cats separate from other age groups. In animal shelters, compatible cats that enter the shelter together should be housed together regardless of age, whenever possible.",

In contrast, in breeding colonies, harem-style housing may be used to facilitate breeding (e.g., a few queens with a tomcat). It is also advantageous to house compatible pregnant queens together before delivery, because they will usually share nursing and neonatal care (Figure 46-24\n).45 After delivery, pairing of queens becomes more difficult. When tomcats are not breeding, they can usually be co-housed with a spayed female, a neutered male, or a compatible juvenile for companionship.

To maintain harmony, removing cats of this personality type from a colony is usually necessary. Reassignment is possible, but may prove difficult, necessitating single housing. Shy, timid cats sometimes have difficulty interacting successfully with more dominant members of a group or may fall victim to a bully, resulting in chronic stress and increased hiding. Placement of shy cats in smaller groups or with calm juvenile cats, where they will not be intimidated or harassed, is generally rewarding and often helps them to \u201ccome out of their shells.\u201d46, 90 Similarly, dominant cats will often accept calm, younger cats, as opposed to other adults by whom they may feel threatened.

Cats typically prevent social conflict through avoidance, and adequate space must be available so that cats can maintain social distance as needed. Crowding can make it impossible for animals to maintain healthy behavioral distance, creating situations where individuals may not be able to freely access feeding, resting, or elimination space because of social conflicts over colony resources. Both crowding and constant introduction of new cats induce stress and must be avoided to ensure proper welfare. The addition of new cats always results in a period of stress for the group, and if there is constant turnover within the group, cats may remain stressed indefinitely. High turnover also increases the risk of infectious disease. If cat group numbers are small, disease exposure will be limited, facilitating control. For all of these reasons, housing cats in small groups is preferred.41, 45, 46\nBOX 46-8Factors Influencing Spatial Needs of Housed Cats46, 59\n\u2022Length of stay\u2022Overall quality of the environment, including use of vertical space\u2022Overall quality of behavioral care\u2022Physical and behavioral characteristics of the cat (e.g., age, personality type, prior experience, and socialization)\u2022Individual relationships between cats (e.g., family groupings, previously bonded housemates, versus unfamiliar groupings and degree of social compatibility among cats)\u2022Turnover of cats (e.g., frequency of introduction of new members)\u2022Total room size\u2022Absolute number of cats\u2022Individual needs and levels of enrichment being used to meet these needs\n",

Juveniles tend to accept a slightly higher housing density than adults. Likewise, previously bonded housemates and families will generally peacefully co-exist at a higher density than will unfamiliar cats. When runs are used, they must have a top panel and should be at least 1.8 m (6 ft) high to allow caregivers easy access for cleaning and care. If chain-link is used, 2.5-cm (1-inch) mesh is ideal, but larger mesh can be used. Existing dog kennel runs can be converted into areas for cat housing. This is an important and practical consideration in animal shelters, because many shelters have experienced a decrease in dog intake, while the need for improved cat housing is great.

These signs usually subside once a new social hierarchy and territorial limits (usually favored resting places) are established. In some cases, arrangement of incompatible cats, even within visible distance of one another, may create substantial anxiety, necessitating rearrangement (Figure 46-26\n). In the case of animal shelters, where population interchange is high, it is generally not feasible to maintain consistent groupings of cats. This underscores the absolute necessity of careful selection and compatibility matching, as well as maintaining a variety of housing styles. Even in modestly populated, carefully introduced, environmentally enriched colonies, behavior problems may occur. For this reason, some facilities elect to use an \u201call in\u2013all out\u201d approach to avoid repeated introductions of new cats into stable groups. In animal shelters, bonded pairs and family groupings of cats frequently enter the shelter together and are usually perfect choices for co-housing.46\n",

If only one or two cats are responsible for social destabilization of a group, they can usually be reassigned to another colony, because it is often the social grouping, not the individual, that is the problem. If a cat shows persistent incompatibility with other cats, he or she should be housed singly. Studies indicate that cats that fight at the time of initial introduction are nearly 40 times more likely to continue fighting in the following weeks and months.61 If overt fighting occurs, cats should be permanently separated.

The physical environment should include opportunities for hiding, playing, scratching, climbing, resting, feeding, and eliminating. Whenever possible, a minimum of 1 litter box and 1 food and water bowl should be provided per 2 to 3 cats and arranged in different locations of the colony space, taking care to separate food and water from litter by at least 0.6 m (2 ft). In addition, placement should allow cats to access each resource from more than one side, whenever possible, without blocking access to doorways. Litter boxes should not be covered, to allow easy access and to prevent entrapment or ambush by other cats. The number of resting boards and perches should exceed the number of cats and should be arranged in as many locations within the enclosure as possible. Open single perches should be separated by at least 0.6 m (2 ft) or staggered at different heights to ensure adequate separation, while larger perches should be available for cats who choose to rest together in close proximity. Many cats enjoy hammock-style perches or semienclosed box-style perches where they can hide. If there are not enough comfortable, desirable resting and hiding places, cats may choose to lie in litter boxes. Comfortable bedding (that is either disposable or can be easily laundered) should be provided. Not only do cats demonstrate preferences for resting on soft surfaces, they experience longer periods of normal deep sleep with soft bedding.23 The environmental temperature should be kept comfortable and constant, and living quarters should be well ventilated, without drafts. By changing location within the colony (e.g., from the cooler surface of the floor to a sunny window), cats should be able to choose the environmental condition they prefer (Figure 46-27\n).46\n",

Depending on the setting, it may not be desirable for cats to access areas above the level of an arm's reach so that cleaning is easy and cats can be easily retrieved from the highest perches if needed. Colony room design should also ensure that cats cannot easily escape. In some cases, constructing a foyer at the entrance to the room will be necessary to minimize the risk of escape when the room is entered (Figure 46-30\n). In addition, ceilings should be constructed of solid surfaces, because cats can easily dislodge the panels typically used for dropped ceilings, and escape into the rafters (Figure 46-31\n).46\n",

This is also important, because not all cats uniformly enjoy human companionship and will be more likely to be stressed by the presence of different caregivers, rather than becoming familiar and more at ease with one.

It is a common misperception that housing more animals in a shelter will result in saving more lives. To the contrary, euthanasia rates are highly correlated to intake rates, regardless of the number of animals that a facility houses. In many instances, keeping more animals in the shelter may actually reduce the organization's ability to help animals, because time and resources are tied up caring for a crowded, stressed population, rather than focusing on adoption or other positive outcomes.",

Moving animals through the system efficiently is the foundation of effective population management. To move animals through the shelter more quickly, delays in decision making and the completion of procedures (e.g., intake processing, transfer from holding to adoption areas, spay/neuter surgery) must be eliminated or minimized whenever possible. In open-admission shelters, even delays of 1 to 2 days can have a dramatic effect on the shelter's daily census, particularly for shelters handling thousands of animals per year. This, in turn, affects the ability to provide adequate care. It is important to recognize that effective population management does not change the final disposition of an animal. It does mean that determinations are made as soon as possible, which serves both the individual animal as well as the population as a whole.",

            "text": "Disinfection is usually accomplished through the application of chemical compounds or disinfectants. The most commonly used of these are reviewed in Box 46-9\n. Product selection should take into consideration the conditions present in a given environment (e.g., the type of surface and the presence of organic matter) and the compound's activity against the pathogens for which the animals are at greatest risk. The nonenveloped viruses, panleukopenia and feline calicivirus, are of particular concern. It is important to note that despite product label claims to the contrary, multiple independent studies have consistently shown that quaternary ammonium disinfectants do not reliably inactivate these important feline pathogens.31, 34, 56 In addition to selecting effective agents, ensuring adequate contact time followed by thorough drying of surfaces is essential for achieving proper disinfection.BOX 46-9Key Clinical Information Regarding Use of Common Disinfectants27, 53, 92Alcohol Hand Sanitizers (70% Ethanol)\n\u2022Although commonly used, they must be applied to clean hands and allowed 20 seconds of contact time to be effective.\u2022They are highly effective against bacteria, but have only moderate activity against viral agents, including feline calicivirus (FCV).\u2022They should not be used as a substitute for hand washing or the use of gloves.\nBiguanides\n\u2022Chlorhexidine is the most commonly used biguanide and is relatively expensive. Its major use is as a surgical preparation agent.\u2022Although biguanide compounds have broad antibacterial activity, they have limited efficacy against viruses and are ineffective against nonenveloped viruses, such as panleukopenia and FCV. Therefore they are not recommended as general-purpose environmental disinfectants.\nChlorine Compounds\n\u2022Household bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) is the most commonly used chlorine compound and is an excellent, safe, and highly cost-effective disinfectant when used correctly.\u2022At a dilution of 1 : 32, bleach is highly effective against bacteria and viruses, including nonenveloped viruses, such as panleukopenia and FCV.\u2022Solutions must be made fresh daily and stored in opaque containers, because bleach is highly unstable once mixed with water and degrades in the presence of ultraviolet light.\u2022Surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned with a detergent, rinsed, and dried prior to the application of bleach, because it is ineffective in the presence of detergents and organic material.\u2022Proper disinfection requires 10 minutes of contact time with a bleach solution.\u2022Although bleach is not effective when mixed with detergents, it can be safely and effectively mixed with quaternary ammonium compounds, which do provide some cleaning activity.101 Therefore this combination can be used for cleaning and disinfection, provided gross organic material is first removed and adequate contact time is allowed. The addition of bleach improves the disinfection properties of the solution, making it effective against nonenveloped viruses, including panleukopenia and FCV.101\n\u2022Concentrations stronger than a 1 : 32 dilution can result in respiratory irritation for both animals and people, as well as increased facility corrosion, and are therefore not recommended for routine use.\u2022At a dilution of 1 : 10, bleach will destroy dermatophyte spores. However, cats must be removed from the environment prior to application of this concentration.\u2022The use of calcium hypochlorite (Wysiwash, St. Cloud, Fla.) is becoming more common and offers the potential advantages of reduced contact time and a neutral pH, which prevents corrosion.108\n\nOxidizing Agents\n\u2022Potassium peroxymonosulfate (Trifectant; V\u00e9toquinol, Buena, NJ) is a commonly used oxiding agent. A 1% solution is reliably bactericidal and virucidal (including nonenveloped viruses).\u2022Despite label claims, independent studies have demonstrated that potassium peroxymonosulfate does not effectively inactivate dermatophyte spores.83\n\u2022Trifectant contains a detergent; therefore it can be used as the primary agent for both cleaning and disinfection. However, periodic use of a degreaser will be necessary to remove ground-in dirt and buildup of organic debris.\u2022Trifectant retains activity in the presence of small amounts of organic material, making it ideal for use on porous surfaces, such as concrete and laminate. Once mixed, the solution is stable for 7 days. A 10-minute contact time is required to ensure complete disinfection.\nQuaternary Ammonium Compounds\n\u2022Numerous products containing quaternary ammonium compounds are available, many of which contain detergents. At appropriate dilutions, as recommended by the manufacturer of a specific product, these compounds have activity against both bacteria and viruses; however, they do not reliably inactivate panleukopenia or FCV, despite label claims to the contrary.31, 34, 56\n\u2022A 10-minute contact time in the absence of organic material is required for proper disinfection.\u2022Although quaternary ammonium compounds may be safely used in cat housing areas, care should be taken to dry surfaces thoroughly before returning cats. Cats that lick quaternary ammonium compounds may develop ulcers of the tongue that can be severe.\nDisinfectants Not Recommended Due to ToxicityThe use of products containing phenolic compounds (e.g., products such as Lysol [Reckitt Benckiser, Parsippany, NJ]) or pine oils (e.g., products such as Pine-Sol, The Chlorox Company, Oakland, Calif.) should not be used in areas housing cats. Exposure to these compounds can cause serious neurologic effects and liver damage.",

It should be used whenever it is feasible to implement effectively, such as in a laboratory setting, a private cattery, or a low-volume, limited-admission sanctuary setting. However, quarantine practices are not effective in most animal shelters, because the high volume and turnover of animals precludes proper implementation of a true quarantine where an \u201call in\u2013all out\u201d system is used.41 Instead, incoming animals are usually added to the \u201cquarantine group\u201d on a daily basis, effectively defeating the purpose of true quarantine and simply prolonging the animal's stay. This is especially concerning given the fact that a cat's length of stay in a shelter is a major risk factor for development of upper respiratory infection.26 For this reason, the use of quarantine is not recommended in most shelter settings. Instead, high biosecurity areas are recommended for housing the most susceptible animals (e.g., kittens less than 4 to 5 months of age). On the other hand, quarantine is warranted when a serious disease is discovered in a shelter population. If healthy-appearing animals are exposed during a serious outbreak, quarantine procedures should be used to stop the movement of animals and prevent further spread of disease. If possible, temporary closure to admittance is also recommended. Quarantine may also be required in bite cases to ensure compliance with state rabies laws.41\n",

In some cases, holding times will be influenced by legally required holding periods prescribed by state laws that allow owners a chance to reclaim lost pets. Legal holding periods are usually not required for owner-relinquished pets and preweaning-age animals, but a brief medical hold (e.g., 1 to 2 days) for evaluation and triage is usually warranted.

In populations where upper respiratory infection is problematic, having two isolation areas for cats with respiratory infections is ideal: one area for those cats with moderate to severe signs that will require more intensive monitoring and treatment, and a separate area for those cats with only mild clinical signs and those that have been treated and are nearly recovered.43 When mildly symptomatic cats can be housed separately from those that are very ill, staff compliance with isolation procedures are often improved.

Poor ventilation and high humidity favor the accumulation of infectious agents, while dust and fumes may be irritating to the respiratory tract. Many cats are particularly sensitive to drafts and chilling, both of which can predispose to upper respiratory infection. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) specialists are uniquely qualified to help establish and maintain the environmental conditions required for animal health. When facilities are designed specifically for housing animals, these specialists should be consulted beforehand to ensure installation of the most effective and efficient systems possible. In reality, many facilities that house cats, including private catteries and shelters, among others, were not originally built for this purpose. Retrofitting existing facilities with the ideal HVAC system is often neither logistically nor financially feasible. Regardless, consultation with HVAC specialists is recommended in order to maximize the potential of the facility's existing system.",

For example, neonatal kittens are more susceptible to hypothermia and generally require warmer temperatures than healthy adult cats. The location of the cats may also be a consideration. For example, enclosures located closer to floor level are often a few degrees cooler than those at higher levels. The exact temperature setting may also vary somewhat based on the season of the year. For instance, power companies typically recommend keeping the temperature between 25\u00b0 C and 26\u00b0 C (78\u00b0 F and 79\u00b0 F) during hot weather to conserve electricity and reduce power bills.41\n",

Although the range considered acceptable is large, a given room should have a relatively constant humidity (i.e., it should not have large fluctuations).

Ten to fifteen air changes per hour is the standard recommendation for an animal room, but more or less airflow may be acceptable or necessary depending on the housing density.54 Theoretically, the best case scenario, and what is typical in laboratory animal settings, is for the HVAC system to allow for 100% fresh (e.g., nonrecycled) air in each room so that the air entering a given room is exhausted out of the building and not recirculated to another room. Maintaining separate ventilation systems for various rooms or areas of a facility prevents exchange of air among them and is recommended, because air pressure gradients that recirculate or cause exchange of air between rooms have been associated with the spread of disease by aerosols.",

            "text": "When applying these standard recommendations to a particular setting, there are some practical considerations that should be taken into account.41 First, even when ventilation systems provide 10 to 15 room air changes per hour, airflow may be restricted inside of cages or other enclosures within the room. In other words, the body of the room may be well ventilated, yet inside the cages, the air may remain relatively stagnant. In this case, ventilation may be improved by altering the housing design or arrangement; for example, the use of flow-through cages, runs, free-range rooms, or outdoor access may result in improved air quality. When considering the recommendations for 100% fresh, nonrecycled air with separate ventilation systems in various areas of the facility, consideration should be given to the fact that respiratory pathogens in cats are not aerosolized because of the cats\u2019 small tidal volume.36 Although droplet transmission is possible, droplet spray does not extend more than 4 feet, and most transmission of respiratory disease in cats is through direct contact with infected cats, carriers, or fomites.94 Although this recommendation seems prudent to consider, especially for isolation areas, it is very expensive to install and operate this type of ventilation system throughout a facility, especially in very cold or very hot climates. If air quality remains good and the facility maintains effective comprehensive wellness protocols, it may not be necessary for animal health.41 More research is needed on the impact of such air exchange, but in the meantime, the author recommends consulting with an HVAC specialist to establish effective and efficient settings to suit the specific needs of the given population. In addition to ensuring good ventilation, it is imperative to use other strategies for maintaining good air quality, including regular maintenance of filters, control of dust and dander through routine vacuuming and periodic deep cleaning, and the use of dust-free litter.52\n",

If rodent control is necessary, the use of rodenticide baits should be avoided, because cats can be exposed even if the bait is not within their reach. Rodents that have ingested the poisonous bait may enter an animal enclosure and, if the animal ingests the rodent, the poison will affect that animal. Humane live traps can be used to capture rodents for removal from a facility. Food containers should be kept tightly sealed, and clutter should be minimized to discourage pests in the environment.",
