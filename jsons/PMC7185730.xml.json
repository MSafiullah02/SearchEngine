Drawing attention to the fact that she was speaking from Canc\u00fan, Mexico \u2013 from where the virus was transmitted by air travel to the UK \u2013 Chan declared that: \u2018Recommendations to avoid travel to Mexico, or to any other country or area with confirmed cases, serve no purpose\u2019 (WHO, 2009a). Building on the WHO\u2019s previous, controversial, decisions to impose travel advisories during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak (WHO, 2003a, WHO, 2003b; Ali and Keil, 2006), Chan continued:They do not protect the public. They do not contain the outbreak. And they do not prevent further international spread (WHO, 2009a).\n",

A considerable literature exists on \u2018pathologies of travel\u2019, much of it historical, focusing on a number of themes including perceptions of European travellers in the colonies (Jennings, 2002; Livingstone, 1999, Livingstone, 2002; Kennedy, 1990), the significance of mobile bodies as a threat to the greater, Hobbesian, \u2018social body\u2019 (Kraut, 1995, Cresswell, 2000) and the role of certain, defined, \u2018others\u20191\nin the spread of infectious disease (Joffe, 1999, Sontag, 1991). More recently, scholarly work has been conducted into the spread of infectious disease by air travel (Mangili and Gendreau, 2005, Tatem et al., 2006, Tatem and Hay, 2007, Budd et al., 2009). A number of these studies, particularly in the field of epidemiology, have tested hypotheses and analysed the results for statistically significant differences. In this paper, we adopt a more qualitative approach, considering the messages broadcast by the UK print media in relation to the H1N1 pandemic. Moreover, we identify the importance of place in the context of emerging infectious disease.",

The liberalisation of its aviation sector and the associated growth in international services at UK regional airports opened up a number of places through which infectious disease could enter the country. It is widely believed that the H1N1 influenza virus arrived in the UK not via London Heathrow or Gatwick (the traditional entry points for all the UK\u2019s long-haul airline traffic) but on a direct charter flight from Canc\u00fan, Mexico to Birmingham International Airport (BIA) in the West Midlands. Whilst its spread has been well documented by \u2018official\u2019 bodies such as the WHO and the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA), there is scope also to focus on UK media discourses. An emphasis on messages given by national and, especially, regional newspapers, in the context of the spread of a specific emerging infectious disease, sets this investigation apart from earlier analyses of international sanitary initiatives aimed at the global traveller (Budd et al., 2009, Bashford, 2006, Zylberman, 2006) and from work on the challenges faced by UK regional airports in preventing the spread of global disease following the liberalisation of the European aviation sector (Budd et al., in preparation).",

This period effectively covers what Chan considered to be the \u2018first wave\u2019 of spread (WHO, 2009a). Our analysis commences with an overview of some existing literature on pathologies of travel, focusing on biosecurity practices in the UK and the international spread of disease. We then consider themes that emerge from the media discourse, notably the contrasting biosecurity practices being performed at airports overseas and within the UK, and their impact on the individual as a potential carrier of disease. In the discussion section, we locate our findings within existing debates on the airport as a site for the control of emerging infectious disease and on the representation of the travelling body.

Much of the rhetoric employed in this discourse has its origins in security policy research, where a distinction is drawn between the \u2018outside\u2019, deemed to be dangerous, and the \u2018inside\u2019, which is \u2018locked down tightly, secured and safe\u2019 (Nerlich et al., 2009, p. 2; see also, Wallis and Nerlich, 2005, Chilton, 1996). In this perspective, rooted in Cold War literature on \u2018containment\u2019, a \u2018unitary state actor\u2019 provides the interface between the inside and outside (Chilton, 1996: 408). The threat posed to a nation\u2019s health by global infectious disease has been \u2018problematized\u2019 as \u2018biosecurity\u2019 (Collier and Lakoff, 2008). Problematization \u2013 often associated with the work of Foucault (Salter, 2007, Dillon, 2007) \u2013 refers to the addressing of events or situations \u2018not as a given but as a question\u2019 (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p. 11). \u2018Biosecurity\u2019, the broad heading given to technical and political efforts to secure health, has become a prominent site of enquiry as scholars seek to understand various forms of expertise and practices through which disease threats are articulated and managed (Collier et al., 2004, Collier and Lakoff, 2008, Bingham et al., 2008).",

Of particular interest is the increased movement of people across borders and the challenge this presents to national and regional practices of containment. The role of mass air travel in the recent worldwide spread of a number of diseases including tuberculosis, SARS and the present H1N1 influenza virus has been documented, analysed and discussed by transnational and governmental agencies (WHO, 2003b, Cooper et al., 2006, Health Protection Agency (HPA), 2007), clinical practitioners (Morens and Fauci, 2007) and academic researchers (Colizza et al., 2006, Avila et al., 2008). At the time of the last influenza pandemic, in 1968, 261 million passengers worldwide travelled by air (ICAO, 1968). In 2008, passenger air traffic exceeded two billion (ICAO, 2008). Such high volumes of travel make containment more problematic. In a recent report, the WHO drew attention to the speed of spread of the current H1N1 outbreak virus:During previous pandemics, influenza viruses took >6 months to spread as widely as the new influenza A (H1N1) pandemic virus has taken to spread in <6 weeks\u2026 (WHO, 2009b, p. 249).\n",

This led to initially complementary media reporting on a number of practices being adopted by other jurisdictions to slow or even halt the spread of disease (The Guardian, 30 April 2009). Many of the measures focussed on the airport, and included: \u2018reinforced checks\u2019 for visitors from affected countries (for example, by the authorities in France); provision of additional medical staff (Australia); use of thermal imaging scanners (for example, Bulgaria, Australia, Singapore, Philippines, and Indonesia); planned detention/quarantining of passengers suspected of carrying H1N1 (for example, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, China, Russia, Taiwan, and Bolivia); and powers to \u2018disinfect\u2019 suspected passengers (Australia) (examples extracted from: The Times, 27 April 2009; The Mirror, 28 April 2009; The Guardian, 30 April 2009).

A mismatch was highlighted between regional airports increasingly hosting flights to more \u2018exotic\u2019 locations, and the capacity of regional cities to manage, and prevent the spread of, an infectious disease epidemic. During the early days of the H1N1 outbreak, BIA, and the Birmingham public authorities, had sought to reassure residents that they would be able to cope with such a public health emergency. Doctors and nurses at the airport had been briefed and would \u2018be available if anyone [was] feeling unwell\u2019 following the flight from Canc\u00fan (Birmingham Evening Mail, 27 April 2009).

A spokeswoman for Manchester Airport, defending this approach, was reported as stating that travellers were only being screened at Heathrow because flights landed there from Mexico City, the then centre of the outbreak (Belfast Telegraph, 27 April 2009; see also The Scotsman, 28 April 2009). At Heathrow and Gatwick airports, health officials and clinicians were reported as being more pro-active, boarding aircraft arriving from Mexico, asking passengers questions and checking them for symptoms of the disease (The Guardian, 27 April 2009; The Express, 28 April 2009; The Mirror, 28 April 2009).

In our analysis, the airport assumes an important role as a site for the operation of various practices of control, ranging from completion of questionnaires to checking passenger body temperature using thermal imaging technology. It is a place where operations of containment were enacted and biosecurity interventions performed. In relation to press reporting, practices of control in overseas airports were frequently presented as being technologically advanced. By contrast, regional airports within the UK were represented somewhat differently. Whilst their hosting of long-haul flights opened up new opportunities for the international traveller, regional press reporting focussed on inconsistencies between airports and, more generally, reflected unease about the ability of these nodes to manage the spread of emerging infectious diseases. In this respect, by not having the technologies or the infrastructure to conduct biosecurity practice rigorously, regional airports were frequently depicted as being less advanced \u2018others\u2019 within the UK. We argue that greater attention needs to be paid to hitherto neglected regional discourses in this area. In their general coverage of the current H1N1 pandemic, we found regional publications to be more pro-active than the national press, urging containment measures from public authorities situated in their locality. Their approach may, in part, be explained by the commercial requirement of regional newspapers to address as great a proportion of the local population as possible, thus creating a \u2018community of readers\u2019 based on membership of a particular place (Aldridge, 2003, p. 498). In this role, the regional press also serve as a disseminator of key public health messages produced both by local health authorities and by airports to give advice and reassurance to the local population.",

On the one hand, there was a key role played by the airport as \u2018censor\u2019 and a point at which the threat posed by the at-risk \u2018other\u2019 could be minimised. Within this context, elements of the UK press have depicted, sometimes through a nationalist lens, the stringent deployment of technologies against UK travellers, in a way that both restricted their freedom and purportedly damaged their human rights. Equally, our analysis has shown that, in certain instances, the outward traveller is expected to behave in a specific, \u2018responsible\u2019 way. In providing evidence of \u2018fitness to fly\u2019, the UK traveller was required to exercise governance over his/her body. Moreover, in electing not to travel to the countries of the South, the UK traveller would demonstrate their \u2018personal ethical responsibilit[y]\u2019 to the population of the country they had planned to visit (The Observer, 2 August 2009). These representations of the \u2018ethical\u2019 long-haul traveller, policing themselves and showing consideration to \u2018others\u2019, contrasts with long-established narratives in which the Western traveller sought to safeguard their own health against contamination from the \u2018degenerate\u2019 environment of the global South (Kennedy, 1990, Anderson, 1996, Anderson, 2002, Livingstone, 2002). In this paper, therefore, our analysis of biosecurity amongst UK press reporting during the first \u2018wave\u2019 of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlights how the global spread of infectious diseases is grounded in particular localities associated with distinctive notions of biosecurity and the traveller.",
