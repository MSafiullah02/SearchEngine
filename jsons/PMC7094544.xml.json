Seven immunocompromised patients with pneumonia due to Aspergillus species were included, and no cases of viral HAP were identified. Kollef et al13 examined 4,543 patients with pathogen-positive pneumonia admitted to 59 US hospitals between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003.13 NVHAP accounted for 18.4% of the patients with pneumonia, and again there were no cases of viral pneumonia identified in this study. More recently, the importance of viruses as a cause of HAP has been recognized because of the availability of molecular probes for the identification of respiratory viruses. A single-center study from South Korea identified 59 patients with severe HAP attributed to a respiratory virus over a 2-year period, accounting for 22.5% of all their cases of severe HAP.5 Over a 6-year period (August 2007 to September 2013), Andruska et al17 identified 9,624 patients with a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia from Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Although viral pneumonia accounted for only 2.7% of all pneumonia cases during this period, it was associated with the second highest rate of hospital readmission (8.3%) after pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria (11.4%).",

Esperatti et al14 examined patients in the ICU setting in whom either NVHAP or VAP developed.14 Despite a lower proportion of identified pathogens in the patients with NVHAP compared with those with VAP, the type of microbiological isolates and clinical outcomes were similar regardless of whether pneumonia was acquired during or without mechanical ventilation. This finding would suggest that patient-specific findings, such as severity of illness and immune function, may be more important factors predisposing to nosocomial pneumonia than previous intubation. Moreover, both types of patients should receive similar empirical antibiotic treatment and benefit from preventive measures that are preferentially directed at intubated individuals. Hospital-based quality-improvement initiatives have primarily focused on preventing the occurrence of VAP and not NVHAP.19, 20 However, it has been difficult to demonstrate attributable mortality from VAP because of the overall severity of illness in the \u201cat risk\u201d ventilated patient population.6 This may account for the inability of the majority of VAP prevention studies to demonstrate reductions in mortality. Our data suggest that NVHAP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality excess and that the prevention of NVHAP could potentially improve patient outcomes.",

Furthermore, it is possible that we did not identify all cases of NVHAP given that we used respiratory culture results and not International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes to screen for study entry. This was purposely done to obtain a patient cohort for whom the treating physicians had a high enough suspicion for pneumonia to obtain microbiological cultures. Second, the data are derived from a single center, and this necessarily limits the generalizability of our findings. As such, our results may not reflect what one might see at other institutions. For example, Barnes-Jewish Hospital has a regional referral pattern that includes community hospitals, regional long-term acute care hospitals, nursing homes, and chronic wound, dialysis, and infusion clinics. Patients transferred from these settings are more likely to be infected with potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This may explain the relatively high rates of infection with potentially antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria and S aureus. Third, given our sample size, we may have lacked power to identify all important confounders that could affect our mortality end point. Fourth, we did not use a protocol for obtaining specific types of culture samples in all patients, rather deferring this evaluation to the treating physicians. This may have contributed to sampling errors in identifying cases of NVHAP. Fifth, we limited the number of matching variables to maximize the number of patients with NVHAP in our study analysis. This may have contributed to unidentified differences in the case and control populations, such as severity of illness or admission diagnoses, which may have contributed to the outcome differences observed. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that bacterial coinfection was present among patients with a viral cause of NVHAP. Antibiotic administration may have limited the ability of conventional culture methods to identify antibiotic-susceptible bacteria in that setting.",
