MHC Class I antigen presentation is critical for CD8 T cell mediated control of viral infections, as secretion of anti\u2010viral cytokines and perforin\u2010mediated cytolysis require T cell receptor: MHC molecule interactions (Slifka et al., 1999). T cell effector functions are also associated with pathologies and neurological abnormalities (Dorries, 2001; Huseby et al., 2001; Ip et al., 2006). Consequently, T cell interactions with CNS glial cells require stringent regulation to balance the positive aspects of antiviral activity with the potential for detrimental immunopathological damage.",

            "text": "Class I surface expression is regulated at multiple levels including proteolysis, peptide transport, and chaperone\u2010aided complex assembly. The majority of peptides presented by Class I molecules are derived from proteasomal degradation of ubiquitin\u2010tagged proteins in the cytoplasm. Proteasomal specificities are conferred by three \u03b2 subunits localized in the catalytic 20S core complex (Strehl et al., 2005). The constitutive proteolytic subunits involved in homeostatic protein turnover can be replaced by interferon (IFN) inducible proteosomal subunits Type 8, 9 and 10 (PSMB8, PSMB9, PSMB10; also known as LMP7, LMP2, and MECL\u201010, respectively) to form the immunoproteasome. Immunoproteosomes release peptides with increased Class I binding affinities (Strehl et al., 2005). Peptides are selectively shuttled from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the heterodimeric transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), formed by the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits (Garbi et al., 2005). In the ER, chaperones aid in assembly of Class I heavy chains, peptides and \u03b22\u2010microglobulin (\u03b22M) to form a stable complex capable of trafficking to the cell surface (Garbi et al., 2005). The major antigen processing components, immunoproteosomes and TAP are encoded in the MHC Class I locus and are inducible by both IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 (Jamaluddin et al., 2001; Paulsson, 2004).",

            "text": "Consistent with sparse Class I expression, the CNS expresses minimal antigen processing associated proteins compared with peripheral organs and lymphoid tissues (Fruh et al., 1992; Stohwasser et al., 1997). However, inflammatory stimuli rapidly induce Class I expression on microglia in vitro and in vivo, coincident with upregulation of antigen processing components (Bailey et al., 2006; Stohwasser et al., 2000). Similar to microglia, IFN\u03b3 stimulates Class I expression on oligodendroglia in vitro and in vivo (Popko and Baerwald, 1999; Sedgwick and Hickey, 1997). By contrast, oligodendroglia specific transgenic expression of Class I heavy chains leads to ER accumulation and severe myelination defects (Baerwald et al., 2000; Power et al., 1996; Turnley et al., 1991). This suggests basal levels of the antigen processing machinery in oligodendroglia are insufficient to deliver peptides for Class I assembly and egress from the ER. The regulation of Class I antigen processing components by oligodendroglia is not only of interest in elucidating their role as targets of anti\u2010microbial CD8 T cells, but also of self reactive CD8 T cells in autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (Huseby et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2001). Stringently regulated Class I expression is also important in prolonging survival of oligodendroglia grafts for therapeutic remyelination approaches (Tepavcevic and Blakemore, 2006).",

            "text": "The present study investigated the regulation of Class I antigen presentation components in oligodendroglia and microglia in a model of neurotropic coronavirus induced encephalomyelitis (Bergmann et al., 2006). The sublethal JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV\u2010JHM) infects astrocytes, microglia and oligodendroglia, spreading rapidly from the brain into the spinal cord (Wang et al., 1992) where it establishes a persistent infection (Marten et al., 2000). Acute viral replication in the CNS is controlled by CD8 T cells, consistent with Class I expression on all glia (Bergmann et al., 2003; Hamo et al., 2007; Ramakrishna et al., 2006; Redwine et al., 2001). Microglia and astrocytes, but not oligodendroglia are susceptible to perforin\u2010mediated CD8 T cell viral control in the absence of IFN\u03b3. By contrast, IFN\u03b3 is required to control virus in oligodendroglia (Gonzalez et al., 2006; Lin et al., 1997; Parra et al., 1999). Whether IFN\u03b3 has a direct antiviral effect or enhances Class I antigen presentation by oligodendroglia is unclear. Delayed Class I upregulation on astrocytes compared with microglia in this viral model presents a precedence for differential regulation of Class I antigen presentation (Hamo et al., 2007).",

Despite undetectable Class I protein na\u00efve microglia expressed significantly higher basal levels of mRNAs encoding Class I antigen presentation components compared with oligodendroglia. Following infection, delayed Class I expression by oligodendroglia compared with microglia correlated with a requirement for IFN\u03b3 and de novo transcription of MHC genes required for antigen presentation. By contrast, microglia only moderately upregulated mRNAs encoding antigen presentation machinery, yet expressed MHC Class I protein earlier and independent of IFN\u03b3. These results are the first to demonstrate more stringent regulation of the Class I antigen presentation pathway by oligodendroglia compared with microglia during CNS inflammation.",

Both glial populations expressed similar levels of Gapdh transcripts per cell when compared with J774A.1 macrophages (Fig. 2A).

By contrast, oligodendroglia within the na\u00efve CNS expressed 10 times lower levels of these transcripts compared with microglia or J774A.1 cells. Similarly, na\u00efve microglia expressed comparable levels of Tap2 and Psmb8 encoding mRNA as J774A.1 cells, whereas these transcripts were barely detectable in na\u00efve oligodendroglia.

To confirm a block in translation rather than ER retention of Class I in na\u00efve microglia, intracellular retention of H2\u2010Db was examined using a Db and Ld cross\u2010reactive mAb (see Fig. 3). Antigen processing deficient T2\u2010Ld cells were used as a control for intracellular accumulation of unassembled Class I in the ER and negligible surface staining. J774A.1 cells were used as a positive control for both surface and intracellular Class I expression. Surface staining confirmed undetectable expression of Class I on microglia, sparse expression on T2\u2010Ld cells and prominent expression on J774A.1 cells (see Fig. 3). Accumulation of intracellular Class I was analyzed following monensin treatment to block the secretory pathway. Detection of surface expression was blocked by pre\u2010incubation with unlabeled mAb to maintain similar conditions (see Fig. 3). Under these conditions, intracellular Class I remained undetectable in na\u00efve microglia. By contrast T2\u2010Ld cells exhibited robust intracellular accumulation of Class I molecules. J774A.1 cells also accumulated intracellular Class I, albeit at lower levels compared with T2\u2010Ld cells. Similar results were obtained in two additional independent experiments in the absence of monensin treatment. These data suggest that the inability of na\u00efve microglia to express Class I complexes (see Fig. 1), despite abundant transcripts encoding all the necessary components (see Fig. 2), is the result of translational repression rather than a post\u2010translational block.",

This dramatic increase in RNA accumulation coincided with expression of Class I molecules on the surface of oligodendroglia (Fig. 1B) and suggests de novo transcriptional activation of genes encoding Class I presentation components.

This local IFN\u03b3 in turn induces Class I expression by oligodendroglia, which peaks coicident with maximal IFN\u03b3 transcript levels and prominent T cell infiltration into spinal cords (Marten et al., 2000). The timing of these interactions is thus critical in establishing a balance between viral spread and CD8 T cell mediated control, as cytolysis is downregulated during the transition to viral persistence (Bergmann et al., 2006) and IFN\u03b3 is crucial in controlling MHV\u2010JHM replication specifically in oligodendroglia (Bergmann et al., 2004; Gonzalez et al., 2006; Parra et al., 1999).",

The high basal levels of Class I transcripts in purified microglia, suggest they are a major source of Class I transcripts previously detected at low levels in the na\u00efve adult brain (Fahrner et al., 1987). Class I expression is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level with conserved promoter elements determining both tissue specific expression as well as responsiveness to cytokines and hormones (Howcroft and Singer, 2003). Coordinated transcriptional upregulation of MHC genes in both oligodendroglia and microglia is consistent with similarities in their core promoter elements (Arons et al., 2001; Brucet et al., 2004). The Tap1 and Psmb9 genes even share a bi\u2010directional promoter. IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 directly activate Class I transcription via JAK/STATs or indirectly via IRF\u20101 induction, which binds the IFN\u2010stimulated response element. IRF\u20101 also binds the shared promoter of Tap1/Psmb9 to drive transcription (Brucet et al., 2004). The critical role of IRF\u20101 in controlling the Class I presentation pathway is demonstrated by low levels of Class I expression in IRF\u20101\u2212/\u2212 mice (Hobart et al., 1997). Following MHV\u2010JHM infection, increased IRF\u20101 to IRF\u20102 mRNA ratios support IRF\u20101 as a primary candidate in enhancing transcription of these genes. IFN\u03b1 mRNA was associated with upregulation of IRF\u20101 mRNA and Class I expression by microglia, whereas IFN\u03b3 mRNA expression correlated with accumulation of mRNAs encoding IRF\u20101 and antigen presentation components in oligodendroglia.

In addition, the modest increases in mRNAs encoding antigen presentation components in microglia support a partial contribution of translational regulation. Post\u2010transcriptional repression of MHC genes has been observed in a variety of cancers, yet the mechanisms are unclear (Luo et al., 1995; Ponzoni et al., 1993). Analysis of proteasomes from primary microglia cultures derived from neonatal mice revealed low, yet detectable protein levels of the immunoproteasome subunits PSMB9 and PSMB8 (Stohwasser et al., 2000), which were significantly increased following IFN\u03b3 treatment. Although IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulation was not analyzed in the latter studies, the data support constitutive transcription of Class I related genes in na\u00efve microglia. Our data suggest that translational repression of MHC associated transcripts, potentially released by IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling, may constitute a provocative new mechanism regulating MHC Class I expression by microglia.",

Low mRNA levels and undetectable protein expression were also observed in unstimulated neonatal oligodendroglia cultures (Massa et al., 1993).

The delayed, yet prominent increase in Class I related genes may result from synergistic stimulation by IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 (Agresti et al., 1998). This strict regulation suggests deviation of cellular resources from myelin maintenance to host defense, a notion consistent with IFN\u03b3 mediated induction of ER stress in oligodendroglia and perturbation of remyelination (Lin et al., 2006).",

Nevertheless, as oligodendroglia are myelin factories, it is feasible to assume they present myelin derived epitopes during inflammation associated with IFN\u03b3 secretion. Indeed, MBP specific CD8 T cells can recognize and lyse oligodendroglia in the absence of exogenous peptide in vitro (Huseby et al., 2001). Similarly, CD8 T cell inflammation induced by overexpression of PLP by oligodendroglia is associated with Class I expression on oligodendroglia and CNS damage (Ip et al., 2006). Activation and clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in brain biopsy samples and CSF of multiple sclerosis patients supports a role of local CNS autoantigen presentation (Babbe et al., 2000; Jacobsen et al., 2002; Skulina et al., 2004). Furthermore, although Class I and IRF\u20101 was prominently expressed by activated microglia/macrophages in multiple sclerosis lesions, both proteins were also localized to oligodendroglia (Gobin et al., 2001). However, in vivo interactions between CD8 T cells and Class I peptide complexes presented by oligodendroglia have not been formally proven. The potent transcriptional upregulation of Class I antigen presentation components by oligodendroglia presented in this report clearly demonstrates a potential for oligodendroglia to present myelin antigens. However, the exquisite sensitivity of microglia to early inflammatory cytokines implicates these cells as targets for initial CD8 T\u2010cell interactions.",
