One of the main causes for the high number of HAI reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) is related to the ability of the microorganisms to survive for long periods in hostile environments such as dry surfaces [1], [2].",

This cross-contamination mechanism has already been recognized and lead to the implementation of hygiene procedures for hands when contacting with patients. Still, it is more likely for a patient to get an infection when staying in a room previously occupied by an infected patient. Thus, infected patients are the primary source of surface and material contamination. Visitors and/or asymptomatic carriers also contribute to the spread of microorganisms, especially in situations where there is an apparent sense of safety [3]. As said before, there are guidelines for surface cleaning and disinfection in hospitals, however, those recommendations are not sufficient to solve such a problem and the incorrect following of the disinfection instructions can even cause greater contamination problems [4].",

Its bactericidal mechanism is based on the binding of silver atoms with thiol (SH) and disulfide (S\u2013S) groups present in the proteins of bacterial cell membranes, leading to its disruption and eventual cell death [87]. Silver has been used for many applications on medical field especially when added in the form of silver sulfadiazine to creams or wound dressings [88]. Several wound dressing containing silver are available on market, however, not always they comply the expectations. Cavanagh et al. [89] analyzed 6 different silver dressings on market and only two of them showed bactericidal activity against S. aureus. Apart from that, silver dressing may be related with increased serum silver levels with an associated decrease on white blood cells [90]. This leads us to conclude that the delivery system of the antimicrobial is very important. A delivery mechanism that acts by contact without leaching silver ions to the surrounding areas or tissues would be good strategy to achieve antimicrobial action without compromise the safety of the product.",

Silver may also have different ranges of efficacy according to the class of bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria's cell walls do not have an outer membrane as Gram-negative bacteria do, but they have several layers of peptidoglycans, making their cell wall thicker [94]; this, along with their negative charge results in the trapping of silver ions (positively charged) preventing their entrance into the bacteria [95].",

Some products even with great results on laboratory will fail when brought to larger scale due to their high cost of production, making them commercially unattractive. But, looking at the numbers nosocomial bacteremia alone can cost a hospital over 1 million euros per year [141], and antibiotic resistance-associated infections may cost more than 900 million euros per year in European Union.",
