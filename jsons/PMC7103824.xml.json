At the beginning of the 21st century, the push for UHC seems stronger than ever.4 The new WHO director general, Dr Tedros, emphasised that UHC is the \u2018top strategic priority\u2019 in the road map for WHO\u2019s renewal.5 Accordingly, WHO\u2019s General Program of Work for 2019\u20132023 has set an ambitious goal of benefiting more than 1 billion people from UHC by 2023.6",

Evidence from China is especially timely for countries pursuing UHC. However, much of the early research focused solely on the first 3-year reform after 2009 in China, without addressing the issue of the reform evolution and progress during the past decade. There is inadequate understanding of how China moves towards UHC step by step. We undertook a literature review, and analysed policies and secondary data from governmental sources. We aim to share the complete experience and strategy about China\u2019s healthcare reform, and provide the critical lessons for other nations, especially for LMICs.",

Priority was given to expanding the scope and health service package of the basic insurance coverage, improving provider payment mechanisms, as well as increasing the financing level, fiscal subsidies and reimbursement rates. To improve equity in access to healthcare between rural and urban areas and efficiency in operation of the schemes,53 the Chinese government consolidated the fragmented health insurance schemes by merging NRCMS and URBMI into the Urban and Rural Resident Medical Insurance in 2016,54 and then established the National Healthcare Security Administration in 2018 to implement unified management for these insurance schemes. In addition, the government launched Medical Financial Assistance in 2003 and Catastrophic Medical Insurance in 2012 as supplementary medical insurance to provide funds for patients with poverty and catastrophic illness.55 The moves, parts of \u2018Health Poverty Alleviation (HPA)\u2019 (a critical element of the national Poverty Alleviation Project), are significant steps towards \u2018Healthy China\u2019 and UHC, protecting people with low incomes from impoverishment due to exorbitant healthcare costs, and breaking the cycle of poverty and illness.55 The payment reform is being implemented to modify the behaviour of providers and to control the unreasonable growth of medical expenses\u2014replacing fee-for-service payment with comprehensive payment methods based on disease category.56",

This innovative strategy can help promote the dynamic balance among medical care, medical insurance and medicine, and construct a coordinating healthcare system to achieve UHC.",
