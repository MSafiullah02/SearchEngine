She also has treated arterial hypertension and evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy but is otherwise free of heart disease. Her medications include bisoprolol, letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor prescribed for breast cancer), memantine (an N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonist used to treat Alzheimer's disease) and apixaban. On admission, she was in no obvious distress but her chest X-ray revealed typical bilateral opacities. Her ECG ( Figure 1A) showed sinus rhythm 63/min, PR interval of 320 msec and narrow QRS with small Q waves in the inferior leads. Her QT and QTc were 450 and 462 msec, respectively. Her laboratory results were significant for positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from throat and nasal swab, lymphopenia, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 14 mg/L, Troponin I of 22 ng/L (range 0-50), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 105 pg/mL, creatinine of 0.81 mg/dL, potassium of 4.51 mmol/L and magnesium of 1.84 mg/dL, along with normal venous blood gases. Her COVID-19 modified early warning score (COVID-19 MEWS) was 3. The next day, her ambient O 2 saturation declined to 93%, and her COVID-19 MEWS was updated to 5. According to our institutional COVID-19 therapeutic approach, oral therapy with chloroquine diphosphate (Remedica Ltd, Cyprus) 500 mg twice daily was initiated. After 5 days of treatment, there was no significant clinical change. A follow-up ECG showed sinus rhythm of 47 beats/min with an extremely prolonged QT-interval (QT=720 msec and QTc=627 msec) ( Figure 1B) .",

She was treated with intravenous magnesium (2 gr of magnesium sulfate injected over 10 minutes), potassium (3 gr diluted in 1L 0.9% normal saline administered over 5 hours) and lidocaine (100 mg in slow bolus followed by a 2mg/min infusion). Also, to prevent the pauses precipitating TdP, isoproterenol (1 mg/50 cc glucose 5%) was administered intravenously at an infusion-rate titrated to raise her heart rate to 80-90/min. This led to immediate resolution of all ventricular arrhythmias. Repeated blood potassium level was 4.43 mmol/L and magnesium was 2.55 mg/dL. The isoproterenol infusion was discontinued after 18 hours. The patient remained free of arrhythmias with no apparent clinical change.

[11] [12] [13] [14] Based on our patient's baseline QT interval (QTc of 462 msec), it was permissible to treat her with chloroquine according to each of these four documents. [11] [12] [13] [14] However, all 4 documents emphasize the importance of discontinuing all QT-prolonging drugs at the onset of chloroquine treatment rather than when excessive QT prolongation is first recognized (as done in our case). Furthermore, all 4 documents emphasize the need for repeated QTassessment at shorter time intervals (rather than after 5 days, as done here). Our patient developed an arrhythmic storm of recurrent TdP 6 hours after discontinuation of chloroquine despite potassium supplementation, probably reflecting the relatively long half-life of chloroquine. 15 A huge number of patients are being treated with chloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive QT prolongation, defined as prolongation to a QTc >500 msec, has already been reported for 11%-25% of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin. 7 Many of these patients are elderly and have comorbidities that increase the risk of drug-induced LQTS. Given its questionable efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 and its risk of QT-prolongation, chloroquine treatment must be considered thoroughly, and reviewed on a regular basis. Clinicians should monitor COVID-19 patients when treating them with chloroquine or other QT-prolonging drugs, with special attention to females, patients with structural heart disease, baseline QT interval on ECG, concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications, potassium or magnesium abnormalities and bradycardia.
