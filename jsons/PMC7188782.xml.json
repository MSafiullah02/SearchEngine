The authors also observed numerous, and often unjustified, changes to recommendations such as adaptations in the processes of quality evaluation, assessment of applicability, and integration of qualitative and quantitative evidence (12, 13). These methodological tweaks were mainly linked to the fact that complex PH interventions implement diverse methodologies that often fall outside a controlled experimental setup such as those processed in randomized controlled trials. However, this could not be a justification for the scarce number of PH technologies assessed by HTA bodies.",

However, this will likely lead to an extension of the survey and fewer responses of individuals. There were clear differences concerning the accuracy of fit. Nevertheless, there has been coding in all four categories of interventions. Differences were found in the three axes of each ICHI measure (target, action, and means).

Reshaping the current public health HTA methods and related practices of policy priority setting will be crucial for implementing efficient and effective interventions. The quickly expanding use of the HTA concepts by professionals and stakeholders from different horizons holds great promise for ameliorations in PH-oriented research and strategies across the different scientific and policy territories in spite of the challenges this poses (13, 49\u201351).",
