Each year, 211,240 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and 40,870 of them will die in 2005 (American Cancer Society, 2005). In United States alone, it is estimated that there are 1 million women with undetected breast cancer; to date, the figure of women affected has surged to 1.8 million and 45, 000 women die per year (Diakides & Diakides, 2003). This high death rate has stimulated extensive researches in breast cancer detection and treatment. Recent studies have determined that the key to breast cancer survival rests upon its earliest detection possible. If discovered in its earliest stage, 95% cure rates are possible (Gautherie, 1999, Pacific Chiropractic and Research Center,). On the other side, it is reported that 70 to 90% of the excisional biopsies performed are found to be benign (Lay, Crump, Frykberg, Goedde, & Copeland, 1990). Owing to this high false positive rate, many endeavors have been putted into ameliorate the breast cancer early detection.",

            "text": "Breast imaging is a noninvasive and inexpensive cancer detection technology. Amongst, mammography is accepted as the most reliable and cost-effective imaging modality. However, its false-negative rates is high (up to 30%) (Elmore et al., 1994, Rajentheran et al., 2001). In addition, the danger of ionizing radiation and tissue density, which has been associated with increased cancer risk (Boyd, Byng, & Jong, 1995), is linked with patient who underwent mammography screening. It is also uncomfortable, because the breast has to be compressed between flat surfaces to improve image quality. Furthermore, obtaining adequate images from radiologically dense breasts (with little fat) or in women with breast implants are difficult (Foster, 1998), and it is difficult to detect breast cancer in young women (Gohagan, Rodes, Blackwell, & Darby, 2004). Despite of these limitations, mammogram remains the gold standard for screenings (Gohagan et al., 2004, Moore, 2001). Since early detection is important, new technologies such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computed Tomography-Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (CT-SPECT) (Del Guerra, Di Domenico, Fantini, & Gambaccini, 2003), and ultrasound have been applied as complement to mammogram (Ng & Fok, 2003). Fig. 1\nand Table 1\nshow the available modalities for breast cancer detection at present, and the reported accuracy, respectively. Note that the reported accuracy is only an estimate because these modalities perform differently on different types of breast cancer, on different age group, apart from the fact that most of the tests are done on small populations.",

Each has its limitations. For example, clinical examination is insensitive, examiner-dependent (McDonald, Saslow, & Alciati, 2004); biopsy is invasive, causes complications, leaves scars, and requires long recovery time (Imaginis, Breast Cancer Diagnosis, 2004, Simmon et al., 2000); MRI is inconsistent, costly and low-resolution (Cardillo, Starita, Caramella, & Cilotti, 2001); PET, CT-SPECT, is expensive and scarce; ultrasound images are of poor resolution (Kotre, 1993, Moore, 2001), and operator-dependent (Chen, Chang, & Huang, 2000); microwave imaging requires accurate modeling of the relation between various tissues\u2019 frequency dependency, and its sensitivity is affected by many factors (Bond et al., 2003, Fear et al., 2002, Kosmas et al., 2004); PEM (Thompson, Murthy, Picard, Weinberg, & Mako, 1995) is expensive and insensitive (Moses, 2004); FNA is operator-dependent (Pisano, Fajardo, Caudry, & Sneige, 2001), and incurs complications (Lucas & Cone, 2003); Gene expression analysis on genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, whose mutations are associated with breast cancer, is difficult as the genes are highly complex. The costly blood storage worsens the matter (Spengler, 2003); MRS is technically demanding, and only of confimatory value to MRI (Cecil et al., 2001, He and Shkarin, 1999); EIS requires localization of lesion before hand (Glickman et al., 2002), insensitive, and observer-dependent (Malich et al., 2003). These methods are often too cumbersome, costly inaccessible or invasive to be used as first-line detection modalities alongside clinical examination and mammography (Keyserlingk et al., 2000, Qi and Diakides, 2003).",

            "text": "Thus, thermogram appears as one of the most promising and suitable alternatives for preliminary screening (Amalu, 2003). Thermogram monitors the breast health based on the heat pattern variation that correlates with the patients\u2019 medical condition (Gautherie, 1999, Head et al., 2000). It is cheap, noninvasive, simple, painless, low cost, and highly accurate if done right, safe (no side effect known), practical, and it requires no contact nor compression, no radiation or venous access (Aksenov et al., 2003, Bamberg, 2002, Gautherie, 1989, Head et al., 2000, Keyserlingk et al., 2000). Infrared breast thermography can increase sensitivity at the critical early detection phase by providing an early warning of an abnormality that is not evident by other approaches (Keyserlingk et al., 2000). It is able to warn women up to 10 years before a cancer is found (Amalu, 2003, Pacific Chiropractic and Research Center,). Furthermore, thermography is the only physical method that mediates significant information on breast physiology (Gautherie, 1989). In contrast to other techniques, its result is independent of nodal status, and unrelated to age, tumor location (right or left breast), and estrogen, progesterone receptor status (Head et al., 2000). Hence, thermogram plays a pivotal role in breast cancer, be it risk assessment (Amalu, 2003), detection, diagnosis, or prognosis (Gautherie, 1989, Head et al., 2000).",

As a result, breast thermography is yet to be widely used and is not recommended by National Breast Cancer Centre (National Breast Cancer Centre Position Statement, 2004). Apparently, thermogram performs no better than other modalities. All in all, if the thermography is done right, it offers a very powerful tool for fighting breast cancer. Thus, by providing decision aids using intelligent system (Ng and Fok, 2003, Ng et al., 2002), good and consistent diagnosis performance can be maintained using breast thermography. At the same time, these intelligent tools can lighten the pressures upon the physicians, and ease the burden of examining large number of images (e.g., 1 million pairs of X-ray images per year is needed to be reviewed Kotre, 1993). A summary of the use of complementing breast cancer detection modalities with intelligent tools is given in Table 2\n.",

This is consistent with a recent review that computer-aided diagnosis shows incremental improvement in sensitivity (Irwig, Houssami, & van Vliet, 2004). MLP or BP is the favorite algorithm to complement various modalities, in spite of its limitations such as slow learning, likely to be trapped in local minima, etc. SOM is another common adjunct for imaging modalities, albeit its poor classification performance, and high memory requirement. Statistical methods like LDA, Bayesian network, and logistic regression are often applied in assisting diagnosis and prognosis. However, statistical methods are difficult to develop, and oftentimes they work under the assumption that the underlying data is normally distributed. Whereas RBF has heavy computation and memory requirements, decision tree is limited in its representation power due to the use of crisp rule. On the other hand, evolving ANN, although it is able to achieve optimal performance, is time-consuming to develop since it may take a few hundreds to thousands runs before it can find the appropriate parameters. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, it may generate inconsistent knowledge base. Most of all, these methods (except decision tree) do not provide any explanations for their computations and reasoning. As a result, the physicians have no way to validate the system operation, and hence, they find it difficult to trust the system.",

            "text": "\nComplementary Learning Fuzzy Neural Network (CLFNN) is therefore proposed to be Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) for breast thermography. CLFNN is a neuroscience-inspired, evolving, and autonomous fuzzy neural network that based on positive and negative learning. CLFNN not only provides good performance in classification, but also fast in learning. Most importantly, CLFNN offers human-like reasoning as well as intuitive fuzzy rules to explain its computations. Since human observer\u2019s image interpretation is often lack of thoroughness and lack of consistency (Bick, 2000), the capacity of CLFNN in providing cognitive interpretation on given thermogram is of great importance for aiding image analysis. Psychophysical evidence demonstrates that even imperfect prompts can enhance human ability in pattern detection (Kotre, 1993). Therefore, CLFNN is believed to enhance the overall accuracy of breast thermography. On the other hand, most of the disease detection works in CAI adopted physic or physically inspired models (Ellis & Peters, 2004), statistical methods such as Bayesian theory and nearest neighbor (Sajda, Spence, & Parra, 2003), or Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (Frigyesi, 2003, Joo et al., 2004). These methods however possess some shortcomings: statistical methods and ANN do not justify, and provide no explanation for their computation. As a result, the output is difficult to trust because it comes without reason. As for model-based system, it is difficult to develop, and many a times requires assumption to be made. This applies to statistical methods as well, as many statistical methods assume that the data is normally distributed. Conversely, other than superior accuracy, CLFNN provides positive and negative fuzzy rules to reason its decisions, and this reasoning is closely akin to diagnostician\u2019s decision-making process. These rules not only can be used to countercheck physician\u2019s diagnosis, they could potentially guide junior physician. Besides, CLFNN can also be adopted to confirm or investigate hypothesis associated with breast cancer such as women having family history of breast cancer belong to high risk group (Cancer Research UK, 2002), temperature difference between left and right breast suggests possible case of cancer (Gautherie, 1989), and so on.",

            "text": "FALCON-ART has five layers and each layer is mapped onto the elements of the fuzzy rule (Fig. 2\n). Before training commences, FALCON-AART consists of input and output layers only. As training progresses, FALCON-AART evolves and automatically constructs its hidden layer by modified Fuzzy ART algorithm (Tan et al., 2004). This algorithm is based on complementary learning paradigm that comprises positive (learn from positive patterns) and negative learning (learn from negative patterns). The modified fuzzy ART algorithm (known as Another ART) improves Fuzzy ART (Baraldi & Bonda, 1999) by functionally models and incorporates the human visual cortical plasticity. With this, FALCON-AART structural learning becomes a function of time (age), which enables FALCON-AART to alleviate the stability\u2013plasticity dilemma as well as to avoid the problem of generating bad clusters as suffered by most competitive learning algorithm. It dynamically partitions the input and output spaces into trapezoidal fuzzy clusters, and subsequently these clusters are finetuned using modified adaptive back-propagation algorithm (Tan et al., 2004). The tuning is done simultaneously to the slope and the location of fuzzy sets. When new training patterns are presented, the stored cluster will resonate if the new training patterns are sufficiently similar to them. The resonant cluster will then expand to incorporate these patterns using the Another ART algorithm. Training terminates when the mean square errors between two consecutive epochs are sufficiently equal.",

They were advised not to put on any powder, ointments, perfume, or any other wipes that will affect the conduction through the skin, around regions to be examined. Before the examination was carried out, volunteers were required to rest for 15\u201320 min for acclimatization to room temperature upon arrival at the examination room. This is important to keep patients in basal metabolic rate which will result minimal surface temperature changes for satisfactory thermograms. Since standardized ambient conditions are necessary to minimize variations in thermography, the ambient temperature was carefully observed for the examination. The examination environment was a controlled, air-conditioned room maintained at an ambient temperature of 20\u201322 \u00b0C (maximum variation is \u00b10.1 \u00b0C), with humidity between 55% and 65%. Direct draughts are avoided in the areas where the patient is positioned. Volunteers wore loose gowns that do not restrict airflow for equilibration and do not constrict the skin surface during this equilibration period. It was ensured that patients were within the period of the 5th\u201312th and 21st day after the onset of menstrual cycle as this is the most suitable period for imaging. This is because women body temperature is known to be stable in this period (Gautherie, 1989), and the vascularisation is at basal level with least engorgement of blood vessels (Ng et al., 2001).",

In this particular case, FALCON-AART is as fast as kNN, LDA, SVM, and Na\u0131\u00a8ve Bayesian classifier in learning (\u2248245 ms). In contrast to statistical methods, FALCON-AART did not make assumption on the data distribution, and this may give superior classification performance even for non-normally distributed data. Note that this result is not comparable to the one in Table 1, Table 2 as this is a different classification task. This classification task involves normal, benign, and malignant whereas the task in Table 1, Table 2 involves only benign and malignant. In other words, from the experimental result shown in Table 4, complementary learning displays superior capacity in multi-class classification than conventional methods.",

In contrast to conventional methods, FALCON-AART constructs intuitive positive and negative fuzzy rules dynamically to depict its reasoning process; these rules can be scrutinized by the physicians and decide upon whether to adopt the system suggestion. In addition, accurate rules identified may be used as a guideline for inexperience physicians in diagnosis. As shown in Table 4, rule generation capability of FALCON-AART is better than its ancestor, in which lesser rules are generated but greater accuracy are attained. Some authors have proposed a few criteria for measuring system interpretability: compactness (lesser number of rule in rule base), coverage (every value in universe of discourse should belong to one of the rule), normality (every rule has at least one pattern exhibit full-matching), and so on (Casillas, Cord\u00f3n, Herrera, & Magdalena, 2003). FALCON-AART learning is a data-centered learning and therefore, it fulfills the coverage and normality criteria. From this experiment, it can be seen that FALCON-AART generates a smaller rule base then its ancestors. Thus, from this aspect, FALCON-AART offers a more interpretable system than its ancestors. Examples of the rules generated are given in Table 5\n.",

This confirms that family history is important risk factor for breast cancer, lending support to the hypothesis that women who have family history of breast cancer belong to the high-risk group. Another example: the performance of FALCON-AART trained on files TH (FATH) and TDF (FATDF) seemed to be inconsistent with the belief that temperature asymmetry between left and right breast suggests possible case of cancer. This happens because the classification task is to classify three classes, instead of classifying out the cancerous case. In fact, the temperature asymmetry between left and right breast may be more useful in determining the stages of cancer instead of cancer detection (Usuki, Maeta, Maeba, & Wakabayashi, 2000).

Besides, sensitivity and specificity are offered as high/higher than the reported accuracy on breast thermography alone, as well as other modalities. However, CLFNN is not to replace, rather, is to complement the breast thermography and to assist the physicians in breast cancer diagnosis. The contribution of CLFNN-breast thermography in enhancing the consistency of breast cancer diagnosis accuracy is believed to bring forth better patient outcome. Comparing the results of Table 2, Table 7, confluence of CLFNN and breast thermography shows a superior performance in breast cancer detection over different conventional methods in medical diagnosis and medical imaging analysis. Medley of CLFNN and breast thermography gives as accurate result, if not better, compared to other combinations of ANN and breast imaging modalities in tumor classification and detection. In general, CLFNN has relatively good generalization capability, in that it can classify well using only a small fraction of the data. Together, this supports the application of CLFNN and breast thermography. This also suggests that the confluence of breast thermography and CLFNN is a promising system for fighting breast cancer.",

            "text": "In this study, it is shown that CLFNN complements breast thermography in various ways. The combination of breast thermography and CLFNN gives better or more consistent result than using breast thermography alone. Whether it is cancer detection, tumor classification or breast-cancer diagnosis (multi-class problem), CLFNN outperforms conventional methods, showing the strength of complementary learning in recognition task. FALCON-AART assists the physicians in different diagnostic tasks by providing relative accurate decision support, and hence could potentially enhance patient outcome. FALCON-AART not only gives superior result than conventional methods, but it also offers intuitive positive and negative fuzzy rules to explain its reasoning process. FALCON-AART satisfies the criteria of an interpretable system: normality, compactness, coverage, and therefore is a more interpretable system. The rules generated are useful because it gives insight to the problem space, provides simple cognitive interpretation of medical image, and could potentially serve as guidelines or arguments for its decision to the physicians. Apart from assisting physician in diagnosis, FALCON-AART can also be used to investigate or to support hypothesis associated with the problem domain, i.e., concept validation (Qi & Diakides, 2003). In this study, only two hypotheses were analyzed. In future, more hypotheses can be assessed using CLFNN by proper experiment setup. Examples are thermal challenge test (Eccles, 2003), cold stress (Usuki et al., 2000) or cooling-rewarming tests (Gautherie, 1999) (outside cooling of the breast will increase the temperature contrast if the breast is cancerous), injection of vasoactive substances (Gautherie, 1999), microwave or ultrasonic irradiation (Gautherie, 1999) and so on. Likewise, FALCON-AART can be applied with advanced technologies, which provides more information in thermography: dynamic thermography (Ohashi & Uchida, 2000), 3-dimensional thermography (Aksenov et al., 2003), or thermal texture map (Hassan, Hattery, & Gandjbakhche, 2003), or Dynamic Area Telethermometry (DAT) (Anbar et al., 2000). Conversely, FALCON-AART can complement thermogram in other application areas such as injuries monitoring (Bamberg, 2002), neurology, vascular disorders (e.g., diabetes), rheumatic diseases, tissue viability, oncology (especially breast cancer), dermatological disorders, neonatal, ophthalmology, surgery (Jones, 1998), as well as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Diakides & Diakides, 2003). Alternatively, CLFNN can be used to complement other medical imaging modalities such as MRI, MRS, PET, etc., as well as to serve as a concept validation tool for techniques such as nipple fluid bFGF (Liu, Wang, Chang, Barsky, & Nguyen, 2000), Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) (Cherepenin et al., 2001), etc. In current study, FALCON-AART does not perform feature analysis, which is an important area that may improve the system performance and deserved to be studied, as recognition requires one to make decision based on some \u201cimportant features\u201d. Moreover, performing feature analysis can reduce the number of antecedents of the rule, and hence improve the interpretability of the system. This will be investigated in future.",
