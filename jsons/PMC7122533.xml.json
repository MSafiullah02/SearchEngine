Rejection can be divided into cellular and humoral forms. Acute cellular rejection is the predominant type of acute rejection of lung allografts . It is mediated by T lymphocytes that recognize foreign human leukocyte antigens (HLA) or other antigens [1, 2]. Humoral rejection is mediated by preformed or de novo recipient antibodies (therefore, also referred to as antibody-mediated rejection [AMR]) against antigens of the donor organ cells.",

For instance, the recipient alloimmune response is thought to be related to the recognition of differences to donor antigens leading to acute lung allograft rejection. Indeed a higher degree of HLA mismatch has been shown to increase the risk of acute rejection although this effect is not consistent across all HLA loci or studies [4, 7\u201310]. Mismatches at the HLA-DR, HLA-B [7], and HLA-A [8] loci, as well as a combination of all three loci [9], appear specifically important. For instance, acute rejection within 2 months after transplantation has been shown to be associated with HLA-DR mismatch, while acute rejection at 4 years has been found to be associated with HLA-B mismatch [11].",

A similar association between vitamin D deficiency and acute rejection has been described in other solid organ recipients including the liver, kidney, and heart. Although the exact mechanism for this phenomenon is not entirely clear, it is speculated that (1) vitamin D might slow down the maturation of antigen-presenting cells as in vitro studies have shown, (2) vitamin D might induce dendritic cells to acquire tolerance, and/or (3) a synergistic effect between vitamin D analogs and immunosuppressants occurs [19].",

Moreover, patients with multiple episodes of even minimal acute cellular rejection were shown to be at increased risk for BOS [46], and yet a single episode of minimal acute rejection without recurrence or subsequent progression to a higher grade has been identified as an independent significant predictor of BOS [47]. Because of these findings, patients who are asymptomatic but are found to have acute cellular rejection (even minimal acute cellular rejection) on a surveillance allograft biopsy might be treated accordingly.

The fibrosis can range from loose myxoid granulation tissue with variable numbers of inflammatory cells filling or partially obstructing the airway lumen in the more acute phase (Fig. 13.7a) to dense hyalinized collagen in the wall of bronchioles that is a characteristic of the chronic phase (Fig. 13.7b). Metaplastic squamous or cuboidal epithelium may overly the bronchiolar fibrosis. Sometimes, only a slit-like lumen of the airway may remain as a result of a confluent submucosal scar or intraluminal polyps of scar tissue. There may be rather prominent capillaries supplying the intraluminal fibrotic areas. Ultimately, the bronchiolar lumen might be entirely occluded by dense scar tissue (Fig. 13.7c, d). In these cases, only an elastic stain highlighting residual elastic tissue, the vicinity of the scar to a pulmonary artery, and residual smooth muscle may indicate that a small airway has been replaced by fibrotic scar. In the chronic phase, inflammation may be minimal or absent.

Although cryobiopsies contained more small airways, all nine cryobiopsies that were also included in that study from patients with clinically proven BOS did not reveal obliterative bronchiolitis in the tissue [31]. This low sensitivity is largely due to sampling and its patchy nature. Therefore, BOS is used and more reliable for the clinical assessment of chronic airway rejection. BOS is calculated as <80% FEV1 in at least two consecutive lung function tests of the patient\u2019s maximum FEV1 posttransplantation [51]. Despite the low sensitivity of transbronchial biopsies for obliterative bronchiolitis, the specificity of this morphologic finding in an allograft biopsy is high, ranging from 75 to 94% [49, 50].

Nine experienced lung transplant pathologists from multiple institutions performed digital slide interpretation to study transbronchial biopsy specimens from patients with known antibody status (established within 30 days of biopsy) and negative infectious workup. The study demonstrated that biopsies from patients with DSA more commonly showed morphologic features of acute lung injury with or without diffuse alveolar damage than biopsies from patients with non-DSA or no circulating antibodies. Endotheliitis was more common in patients with DSA than patients without circulating antibodies. However, there was no difference in occurrence of endotheliitis\nbetween biopsies from patients with circulating non-DSA vs DSA or non-DSA vs no circulating antibodies. Specimens associated with DSA had a significant higher frequency of capillary inflammation, including neutrophilic margination, increased neutrophils, or capillaritis with karyorrhexis than patients with non-DSA or no circulating antibodies. C4d staining was positive in less than 50% of capillaries in 14% of biopsies and in more than 50% of capillaries in 7% of biopsies. While there was no difference between the groups in biopsies with <50% staining, biopsies with DSA more often had over 50% capillaries staining for C4d than biopsies without any circulating antibodies. There were no significant differences identified between HLA classes of the DSA and any of the evaluated pathologic findings. Taken together, this study identified capillary inflammation, acute lung injury, and endotheliitis as morphologic features in lung allograft biopsies that correlate with the presence of circulating DSA. However, none of these histopathologic features were specific to patients with DSA. Morphologic findings of acute lung injury with diffuse alveolar damage had the highest odds ratio for the presence of circulating DSA. This study also cautioned the usefulness of C4d immunohistochemical stain for the diagnosis of AMR in lung allografts because of its infrequent diffuse positivity. Although the study shows that some morphologic features correlate with the presence of circulating DSA and, therefore, might be histopathologic markers to at least suggest the possibility of AMR, the reproducibility of these morphologic features is quite problematic even among experienced lung transplant pathologists. In fact, the interobserver reproducibility kappa values ranged between 0.14 and 0.4, indicating a less than a chance to moderate agreement. The lowest agreement was noted for suspicion for aspiration (median kappa, 0.14) and the highest for acute cellular rejection, alveolar hemosiderosis, and C4d staining (median kappa, 0.4, all).",

This specimen requirement was based on the \u201cuniform opinion of the consensus meeting.\u201d To ensure that the minimum number of required pieces of alveolated lung parenchyma is available for pathology review, it is recommended that the bronchoscopist needs to take more than five pieces. Even more pieces might be necessary to provide small airways for review. Interestingly, a prospective 12-month single-operator study by Scott and colleagues [88] including 219 transbronchial allograft biopsies with 6 to 56 samples per procedure (mean 17.3 samples per procedure) taken from 3 lobes (or 2 lobes and the lingula of 1 lung) of 54 heart-lung transplant and 2 single lung transplant recipients revealed a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 90% for identification of rejection by histopathology. This study estimated that 18 samples per procedure are needed to have a 95% confidence of finding rejection. Therefore, false-negative results due to patchy distribution of acute rejection are likely not uncommon. The absence of histologic and immunophenotypic features of acute rejection or antibody-mediated rejection requires clinicopathologic correlation as a negative biopsy does not necessary rule out rejection. Furthermore, the bronchoscopist should be familiar with imaging studies, especially high resolution computed tomography studies if available, and aim to sample radiologically abnormal bronchopulmonary segments. If such imaging was not recently performed or the results are normal, then samples should be obtained from different lobes to try to minimize sampling error.",

When reviewing transbronchial biopsy material of these patients, attention must be paid not only to features of rejection but also to its morphologic mimickers, especially infection, PTLD, and abnormal drug effect. Before a diagnosis of acute cellular rejection can be rendered, an infectious process should be excluded by using stains for microorganisms and/or clinical tests including cultures of BAL and/or tissue and serology. While studies to identify histopathologic and immunophenotypic features of AMR are evolving, there are currently no specific morphologic findings, and clinical and serologic correlations are required for the diagnosis. Prospective, well-designed long-term studies with longitudinal data of therapeutic intervention of ACR on histopathology in totally asymptomatic patients with no physiological or HRCT evidence of allograft dysfunction are needed to determine the clinical significance and relevance of such interventions.",
