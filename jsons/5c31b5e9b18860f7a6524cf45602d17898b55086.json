Diatom morphologists have long recognized the diversity of form within it, and since the works of Kiitzing (1 833, 1844), common practice has been to divide it into a number of sections containing species that appear similar with light microscopy. Patrick (1 959) described the historical development of these sections and proposed raising them to the rank of subgenera. In spite of this taxonomic formalization, the sections established by Cleve (1 894, 1895) , with modifications by and Hendey (1964) , are deeply embedded in contemporary diatom taxonomy and still enjoy common usage.",

Glutaraldehyde fixed cells and hydrogen peroxide cleaned cells were washed several times in distilled water, settled onto polylysine (Polysciences Inc.) coated coverslips (Sanders et al. 1975) , dehydrated in a 10% graded acetone series (10 min each) and processed in a Denton DCP-1 (Cherry Hill, NJ) critical point drying (CPD) apparatus using liquid CO,. After CPD the coverslips were attached to aluminum SEM specimen stubs and coated with 30 nm Au/Pd in a Denton DV 515 vacuum evaporator.

This has caused some difficulty in interpretation. Each side of the raphe sternum bifurcates externally (Fig. 10) to form the longitudinal ribs in the axial area. Either three (Figs. 6, 8) or four (Figs. 5, 7) such ribs may be visible depending on the position or specimen. In those specimens with four axial ribs the raphe slit is visible between the two medial ones. However, the slit is only visible near the central area in those valves with three ribs apparent. As Figures 8 and 11 suggest, the two medial ribs may overlap one another, obscuring the raphe slit and one rib in surface views. It is likely that overlap of the medial ribs is the natural configuration and that partial collapse of the girdle during preparation exerts a force pulling the raphe slit open (Fig. 9 ).",

Only the inner edge of the right half of the sternum is visible; it wraps over the left half (Fig. 14, white arrow). The raphe slit is visible between the two (Fig. 14, SL) . Because one side of the sternum wraps over the other, the raphe slit is difficult to observe internally ( Fig. 12 ) except near the valve apices where the sternum ends in small straight helictoglossae (Fig. 15 ). Presumably it is the helictoglossae which form the \"terminal nodules'' as viewed with BFM.",

In general, bands decrease in diameter in an abvalvar direction (Fig. 22) . The valvocopulae and copulae are split rings (not completely encircling the girdle) opening alternately at opposite apices (Figs. 24, 26, 27) . The gap in each copula is closed by a ligula on the adjacent abvalvar copula, and the ends of the copula appear to fuse to the ligula (Figs. 26, 27) . Copular overlap is facilitated by a flattening of the semi-tubular elements at the poles, but the elements do not overlap along most of the length of the frustule. T h e valve mantle overlaps neither the inner nor outer valvocopular wall; instead the comblike teeth of the inner wall fuse directly to the valve margin (Figs. 11, 15 ), whereas the exterior wall often appears free (Figs. 9, 24) .",

Crosssections of valves show that the external strips are flat in H. ostrearia (Neuville et al. 1975 ) but subcylindrical in N. complanatoides.

More similarities between these taxa become apparent when the internal raphe paths are examined. They all have the raphe slit in a ridge which is bordered by additional ribs developed to different degrees. In N. ramosissima (C.A. Ag.) Cleve (Sect. Lineolatae) one rib extends almost the entire length of the raphe system (Cox 1977) . In Pleurosigma angulatum (Quekett) W. Smith there is a short rib on both sides of the raphe near the center of the valve (Schrader 1973 , Cox 1977 , 1979c , and in Gy- rosigma the two ribs may differ in the extent of their development from species to species. T h e two ribs are developed equally in G. balticum (Ehr.) Cleve (Schrader 1973 ) and G. fasciola (Ehr.) Cleve (Cox 1979c ) but unequally in G. attenuatum (Kutz.) Rabh. (Cox 1977) and G. litorale (W.

In N. complanato~~es these ribs (comprising the raphe sternum) are much deeper than in the above taxa, but once again their development is asymmetrical. The larger one covers the raphe and wraps over the smaller one in the central area, with the overlap decreasing toward the poles until the raphe is visible near the valve apices. iV. pswdocomoides (Sect.

He stated that all raphes examined thus far are variations on four basic designs. The only species shown by Krammer (1982) in which the raphe slit is formed by two deeply intruding ribs of the sternum (termed raphe costae) is from the genus Mastagloia Thwaites. He considered it a variant of the key and slot design typical of the Naviculaceae (Krammer 1982) . Unfortunately, information about the raphe slit in cross-section is not available for all the taxa appropriate for comparison to N . complanatoidrs. T E M investigations of Neuville et al. (1975) show that the raphe in Haslea ostrearia is of the key and slot variety. There is one deep and one shallow raphe rib, and each has a key and slot such that the raphe slit follows two sharp bends forming an \"S.\" Both ribs in N. complanatoides deeply intrude into the frustule but the single key and slot is weakly developed so that the raphe slit is straight except for the slight hook at the internal edge of the ribs.",

Such an axial canal-raphe is structurally similar to that in the Epithemiaceae and Surirellaceae (Paddock and Sims 1977) but is unknown in the Naviculaceae. Geissler and Gerloff presented no solid evidence in support of their claim, nor did Karayeva (1978b) provide new evidence to support this for N. complanatoides.

With the exception of N. hjlalosira, drawings and micrographs (Hustedt 1962) show very similar girdles in Group 3 species. In N. hjalosira, however, the girdle bands are wide and curved, with bands from the epicingulum and hypocingulum intersecting at an angle (Hustedt 1962 , Fig. 1447 ). The figure bears strong resemblance to that of N. pseudocomoides drawn by Cox (1977, Fig. lH) , perhaps indicating a fundamental difference between Group 3 species.

It is possible to envisage such a structure as the progenitor of tubular bands. Paddock and Sims (1 980) have shown the presence of hollow bands in two Undatella species and believe that a third also has such bands. Their precise structure and integration were not determined, but struts crossing the cell interior from one side of a band to the other were found. The complex girdle of Rhabdonema arcuatum (Lyngbye) Kutz. includes hollow bands which are rectangular in cross-section and internally partitioned into a number of chambers (Pocock and Cox 1982) . Each band possesses a collar-like margin on its abvalvar edge and overlaps the succeeding band. Although complanatoides bands often appear not to overlap the succeeding bands, they may have been pulled apart during specimen preparation. As in N. complanatoides, R. arcuatum has flat pleurae facilitating overlap of the epicingulum over the hypocingulum.",

It may be obvious that such deep girdles need to be strengthened; more intriguing questions are: Was the evolution of deep girdles via selection for that trait or the result of selection on a correlated trait? If deep girdles were selected for, what is their adaptive value? In any case, the presence of collar-like margins on tubular bands and the retention of flat pleurae in otherwise tubular girdles, in two unrelated species, may be indicative of shared constraints in the evolution of novel frustule designs.",

Similarities in valve construction between Naviculae lineolutae, Pleurosigma, Gyosigma, N. complanatoides and Haslea suggest a close affinity between these taxa. The development of continuous longitudinal striae from cross-lineate striae, and the increasing size and asymmetry of the raphe ribs from the N . lineolatae to Pleurosigma, Gyrosigma, and N. complanatoides and Haslea, is hypothesized to represent change in homologous characters from the ancestral to the derived state.

As a consequence, N. complanatoides and similar species in the Naviculae microstigmatacae Group 3 should be removed from Navicula and placed in their own genus within the Naviculaceae. T h e genus Proschkinia has been published by Karayeva (1 978b) for N . complanatoides and similar species, but it was not placed in the Naviculaceae. Future phylogenetic work on the taxa discussed here would benefit from detailed investigations of additional species so that more characters can be incorporated into the analysis.",
