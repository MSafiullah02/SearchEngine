Pathogen detection in the clinical laboratory is also limited by the available tests, which often target conserved sequences (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or real-time [RT]-PCR) or specific antigens or antibodies to detect known viruses. Multiplex testing for clinical syndromes, particularly for respiratory-tract infections, allows for a less biased approach to viral diagnosis but still faces limitations in identifying emerging pathogens [2] .

Amplicons can then be recovered from the array, then cloned and sequenced [5] . This technology was used in the identification of SARS coronavirus from a cultured patient isolate [4] .

Sequence-independent approaches include subtractive hybridization or representation difference analysis, sequence-independent single-primer amplification, and rolling circle amplification. These techniques have been used to identify agents such as human herpes virus 8, torque teno viruses (TTV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), Norwalk virus, parvovirus 4, and human bocavirus (HBoV) [4, 7] . Viral metagenomics has been aided by the development of a number of new sequencing platforms. Termed next-generation sequencing (NGS, or deepsequencing), such technologies allow for the rapid and parallel generation of 10 6 to over 10 9 sequences per run. Most current technologies rely on nonspecific amplification of viral DNA or RNA from samples treated to remove host nucleic acids. Amplification is followed by sequencing by synthesis using different technologies to detect base incorporation [6] [7] [8] . NGS has been utilized to identify novel viruses in patient samples and in studies of fevers of unknown origin [9, 10] . NGS has a great ability to detect both known and previously unknown (divergent) viruses, but mere detection does not demonstrate causation. For many of these viruses, classical Koch's postulates cannot be applied, and as demonstrated with TTV and HBoV, establishing a causative role for these agents can be difficult [6, 11, 12] . Mokili and colleagues [6] proposed \"Metagenomic Koch's Postulates,\" but whether they are sufficient remains moot. At this time, NGS is largely a tool for research purposes. Sequencing reactions take a good deal of time to set up and perform [8] . These runs generate massive amounts of data that must be filtered prior to analysis using various alignment programs designed to handle the large numbers of short reads [8, 9] . Finally, results must be interpreted carefully. Contaminants from the laboratory and even from commercial reagents are often identified (eg, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus), and confirming the presence of a virus identified with small numbers of reads may not be possible [9, 13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 137, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 138, "end": 140, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 521, "end": 524, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 525, "end": 527, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1031, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1035, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1039, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1155, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1159, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1482, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1486, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1490, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1518, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1737, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1912, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1913, "end": 1915, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2209, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2213, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "VIRAL DISCOVERY"}, {"text": "Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type 1", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EMERGING AND REEMERGING VIRAL PATHOGENS"}, {"text": "Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) seroprevalence rates range from 3% to 30% in endemic areas, to <1% in Western countries [14] .

The largest study of HSCT for ATL involved the retrospective analysis of 386 patients with ATL who had undergone an allogeneic HSCT at 3 centers in Japan [23] . Their 3-year survival rate was 33%; ATL recurred in 41% of patients who survived to 30 days post transplant. Those who received transplants from a related HTLV-1 seropositive donor had a higher risk of disease-associated mortality relative to those whose related donor was HTLV-1 negative. HSCT recipients in complete remission at the time of transplantation had a higher rate of survival compared to patients not in complete remission (51% vs 26%) [23] . The transmission of HTLV-1 through transplantation or transfusion has been documented. In Spain, 3 HTLV-1-negative recipients of organs from a single HTLV-1-positive donor (1 liver and 2 kidney transplants) developed HAM within 2 years of transplantation [24] . Two case reports document the occurrence of HAM in a heart transplant recipient and an HSCT recipient who acquired HTLV-1 through blood transfusions [16, 25] .
