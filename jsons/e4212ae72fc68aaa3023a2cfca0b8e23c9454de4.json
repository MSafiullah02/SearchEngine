            "text": "Viruses other than the classic hepatotropic viruses, hepatitis A through E, may cause hepatic injury [ 1 ] . Among these are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpes viruses (HHV) 6, 7, and 8, human parvovirus B19, and adenoviruses (Table 12 .1 ). The clinical presentation of infections with these viruses may be indistinguishable from that associated with infection with classic hepatotropic viruses. The presentation ranges from a mild and transient elevation of aminotransferases to acute hepatitis and liver liver failure [ 1 ] . These viruses should be considered as possible etiologic agents in patients who have acute liver injury and whose serologic markers for the classic hepatotropic viruses are not indicative of an active infection [ 1 ] . In the present chapter, we review the clinical manifestations and the potential for immune-mediated liver injury associated with several of these viruses (see summary Table 12 .2 ). the virus to establish different forms of infection [ 2 ] . Cell entry and translocation of EBV particles to the nucleus is confi rmed by detection of the EBV genome in isolated nuclei [ 3 ] . While B cells in the oropharynx may be the primary site of infection, resting memory B cells are thought to be the site of persistence of EBV throughout the body. EBV has evolved several strategies to evade immune system recognition and to establish latent infection in memory B cells, where it resides lifelong without any consequence in the majority of individuals [ 4 ] . After infecting B lymphocytes, the linear EBV genome becomes circular, forming an episome, which usually remains latent in these B cells. Only ten of the viral proteins are expressed in latently infected B cells in vitro. Limited gene expression during latency ensures successful escape from cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition [ 2 ] . EBV shares the tendency of establishing latency in the host with other herpes viruses [ 2 ] . Viral replication is spontaneously activated in only a small percentage of latently infected B cells [ 5 ] .",

Innate immunity uses several \"pattern recognition\" receptors to sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [ 4 ] . Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation has downstream effects during primary EBV infection that favor viral latency or reactivation and facilitate immune control. Intact viral particles are recognized by the membrane surface receptor TLR2 [ 11 ] . Following viral entry into cells, viral DNA is recognized by TLR9. Dual interactions through TLR2 on the cell membrane and intracellular TLR9 lead to a rapid production of IL-8, initiating an effective antiviral immunity. Innate lymphocytes also play a role in resistance to EBV-associated malignancies. Mutations in SAP (signalinglymphocyte activation-molecule-(SLAM)-associated protein) are associated with loss of EBV-specifi c immune control [ 4 ] . During EBV latency, the virus develops mechanisms of immune escape from innate immunity-dependent mechanisms, including the inhibition of NK cell activation through EBV-induced gene 3 (EBI3) [ 4 ] . EBV-transformed B lymphocytes express high levels of EBI3 protein, which has immunosuppressive activity [ 12 ] .",

This is also demonstrated by the reduced phagocytic activity observed in EBV-infected monocytes [ 3 ] . EBV infection inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge by reducing their phagocytic potential [ 15 ] . By inhibiting the differentiation of monocytes into mature DCs, EBV temporarily halts the onset of immune responses during primary infection, enabling effi cient viral replication. This permits the accumulation of a large pool of virus-infected B lymphocytes, allowing access of the virus to the memory B-cell compartment, interfering with the functions of DCs during the initiation of virus-specifi c immunity, and modifying the profi le of secreted cytokines, thus creating a favorable environment for viral propagation [ 3 , 4 ] .",

If infection is delayed to adolescence or adulthood, it can cause infectious mononucleosis (IM), a self-resolving lymphoid disorder largely resulting from an uncontrolled T-cell reaction directed against EBVinfected cells. In IM patients, EBV is exclusively found in B blasts that proliferate under the infl uence of latent genes [ 4 ] . Following resolution of the primary infection, EBV establishes a lifelong persistence in memory B cells in which the virus remains clinically silent. In this B-cell reservoir, viral expression is entirely repressed, a process described as \"true latency.\" Short episodes of spontaneous reactivation and consequent viral replication normally occur in healthy individuals [ 24 ] . Manifestations of liver involvement in immunocompetent hosts range from mild self-limiting acute hepatitis to occasional reports of fatal acute fulminant hepatitis. Abnormal liver blood tests are common in EBV infection and occur in up to 90 % of patients, but symptomatic hepatitis is rare [ 23 ] . Jaundice is present in only 5-10 % of cases. Typically, the rise in aminotransferases is gradual, reaching a peak that is lower than that encountered in acute viral hepatitis [ 1 ] .

CAEBV is defi ned by chronic severe illness, which begins as a primary EBV infection associated with elevated transaminases, abnormal EBV serology, suggestive histopathological features, and detection of viral genome in the liver tissue. Evidence of recurrent EBV reactivations, increased circulating EBV-specifi c CTLs, and increased CD38 B-cell expression, along with increased LDH levels, mild splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia, can support the diagnosis [ 2 , 31 ] . CAEBV may also progress to a chronic or recurrent IM-like disease [ 35 ] . In Western countries, CAEBV is milder than in Asian countries [ 2 ] . The mild form is characterized by intact immune control of B cells, relatively low viremia, and EBV-specifi c CTL expansion comparable to those of seropositive donors. Patients with iatrogenic, congenital, or acquired immunodefi ciency are at increased risk for EBV-associated lymphomas and CAEBV. Immune senescence in the elderly is also associated with both reactive and neoplastic EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV may also trigger autoimmune hepatitis [ 36 ] , chronic granulomatous hepatitis [ 37 ] , and vanishing bile duct syndrome [ 38 ] . While the existence of acute mononuclear hepatitis during primary EBV infection is accepted, skepticism has been expressed as to the hypothesis that EBV causes chronic liver disease in immune-competent patients. EBV in this setting may be referred to as an \"incidental virus,\" refl ecting a co-infection with other hepatotropic viruses that are a more likely cause of chronic liver disease or amplifi cation of the EBV genome in circulating B cells that turn up in the liver [ 2 ] .",

            "text": "Primary EBV infection is subclinical in the majority of immunocompetent individuals; it may lead to IM in adolescents and adults. It is generally self-limiting; therefore, in immunocompetent individuals, symptomatic treatment alone is recommended. This includes rest, adequate hydration and nutrition, and analgesics or antipyretics as needed. In patients suffering from IM, avoidance of exertion and participation in sports is recommended for at least 3 weeks due to the rare risk of splenic rupture. Rare patients suffering from severe complications of acute EBV are usually treated with corticosteroids even though there is little evidence to support their use [ 43 , 44 ] . The dose used varies in different reports. The use of antivirals in the management of severe EBV infections in immunocompetent hosts is debatable. However, it is suggested as an adjunct to steroid treatment [ 45 ] , especially in cases of refractory disease [ 46 ] . Several antiviral drugs, including acyclic nucleoside and nucleotide analogues and pyrophosphate analogues, inhibit replication of EBV in cell culture via inhibition of EBV DNA polymerase. Acyclovir inhibits in vitro EBV replication and transiently reduces viral shedding in the oropharynx but does not reduce viremia or symptoms. Ganciclovir was effective in the treatment of EBV hepatitis in a small number of children and in adults [ 47 ] . Valganciclovir, the oral pro-drug of ganciclovir, has been successfully used in the treatment of severe acute EBV hepatitis (900 mg \u00d7 2/daily for 15 days) [ 46 ] . Additional drugs with antiviral activity against EBV include valacyclovir, famciclovir, and foscarnet. Patients with acute liver failure should be considered for urgent liver transplantation, as the likelihood of spontaneous recovery is small [ 48 ] . Patients with immunodefi ciencies are at increased risk of liver failure and the development of lethal lymphoproliferative diseases. The major pathogenic causes thought to be important in the development of lymphoproliferative disorders/lymphomas are primary immunodefi ciency (XLP, ataxia telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, SCID, CVID, and others), immunosuppressive therapy, and HIV/AIDS. In these patients, primary EBV infection should be treated preemptively with ex vivo-generated EBV-specifi c CTLs or effective antiviral medication. In seronegative patients with XLP, monthly prophylaxis with IVIG is recommended. Patients who have developed EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease may benefi t from chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biological therapy with monoclonal antibodies or EBV-specifi c CTLs. Hematopoetic stem cell transplantation is the only potentially curative therapy for many patients but is usually recommended only in children [ 49 ] .",

An association between CMV and an accelerated course of HCV recurrence was described [ 64 ] . Forty-eight percent of HCV-transplanted patients who developed CMV disease had allograft loss or died within 3 years of transplantation, compared to 35 % of patients with asymptomatic CMV infection and 17 % of those who did not develop CMV infection [ 64 ] .",

Prophylaxis is recommended in all CMV D+/R\u2212 liver recipients [ 75 ] . Several clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in preventing the direct and indirect effects of CMV after liver transplantation [ 68 ] . Compared to placebo, patients who received antiviral prophylaxis had a 58-80 % reduction in CMV disease and a 40 % reduction in CMV infection [ 68 ] . The use of acyclovir as anti-CMV prophylaxis after liver transplantation has been supplanted by ganciclovir and valganciclovir because of their superior effi cacy [ 71 , 76 , 77 ] . Prophylactic versus preemptive therapy for intermediate-and low-risk groups (D+/R+, D\u2212/R+, and D\u2212/R\u2212, respectively) is based on the local expertise of each transplant center. However, the general approach for D\u2212/R\u2212 patients is that only seronegative blood products are used and no prophylaxis is administered. D+/R+ or D\u2212/R+ patients are monitored for CMV reactivation and treated preemptively for 7 days. Where available, \"protective matching\" of donor and recipient based on CMV serological status is advocated because it has been shown to reduce the risk of post-transplant CMV disease [ 69 ] . The current recommendation for antiviral treatment of CMV disease after liver transplantation is intravenous ganciclovir along with a reduction in the degree of pharmacologic immunosuppression [ 78 ] . Valganciclovir is a possible oral treatment for mild to moderate disease [ 78 ] . In cases of ganciclovir-resistant CMV disease, treatment options include foscarnet, cidofovir, CMV hyperimmune globulins, or lefl unomide [ 69 ] .

In transplanted patients, primary infection can present with an aggressive liver disease [ 1 ] . Such infection may occur in the immediate postoperative period or up to several months after liver transplantation and is usually associated with rapid onset and fatal hepatitis [ 87 ] . Serologic testing is of little value in immunocompromised patients. Confi rmation of diagnosis is made through isolation of VZV from skin lesions or from the affected organs. Liver biopsy often shows foci of coagulative necrosis and intranuclear inclusions with an infl ammatory response [ 1 ] . Early administration of intravenous acyclovir is critical in the setting of VZV hepatitis, especially in immunocompromised patients [ 1 , 88 ] .",
