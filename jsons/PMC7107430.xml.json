Recombinant GP (1\u2013650 residues) and rGP-N-terminal half containing receptor binding domain ([RBD] 1\u2013308 residues) were expressed fused to a polyhistidine tag at the C-terminus and purified using Ni-NTA chromatography. The EBOV-GP proteins were coupled to a GLC sensor chip with amine coupling at pH 4.5 (partial denaturing condition) with 100 resonance units (RUs), or they were captured on an HTG surface (native condition) via the His6 tag at 100 RUs in the test flow cells. Samples of 200-\u03bcL serially diluted purified SAB-132 and SAB-139 at 1, 0.1, and 0.01 mg/mL were injected at a flow rate of 50 \u03bcL/minute (240-second contact time) for association, and dissociation was performed over a 1200-second interval (at a flow rate of 50 \u03bcL/minute). Responses from the protein surface were corrected for the response from a mock surface and for responses from a separate, buffer-only injection. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2D7 (anti-CCR5) was used as a negative control in these experiments. Antibody off-rate constants, which describe the stability of the complex, ie, the fraction of complexes that decays per second, were determined directly from the SAB-132 and SAB-139 polyclonal IgG interaction with rGP using SPR (as described above) and calculated using the Bio-Rad ProteOn manager software for the heterogeneous sample model as previously described [11, 13]. To improve the measurements, the off-rate constants were determined from 2 independent SPR runs.",

These IgG preparations were evaluated using a highly diverse EBOV GP GFPDL library (>107 unique phage clones) composed of GP fragments spanning the entire GP that was previously used for analyzing human antibody response to live rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP vaccination in adults [11]. The GFPDL affinity selection showed that the prevaccination IgG (negative control) bound very few phages across most of the GP (data not shown). SAB-139 (rGP nanoparticle vaccinated animals) purified IgG demonstrated 2-fold higher number of phages bound compared with the SAB-132 (DNA vaccinated animals) IgG. Sequencing of GP fragments expressed by eluted phages showed a high frequency of phage displayed peptides mapping across the GP1 head domain and the C-terminal GP2 stalk domain of the EBOV GP (Figure 1A and B). Both SAB-132 and SAB-139 bound phages containing GP sequences predominantly from the glycan cap and the mucin-like domains (MLDs). However, rGP nanoparticle-generated SAB-139 antibodies showed more diverse antibody epitope profile than the DNA vaccine-generated SAB-132 IgG. Specifically, SAB-139 recognized more epitopes mapping to the C-terminus of GP1 and to the heptad repeat 2 in GP2 stalk domain.",

The EBOV/SUDV-GP DNA (SAB-132) and rGP nanoparticle (SAB-139) vaccination of TcBs induced antibodies that identified 6 additional antigenic sites in the current study (represented with black bars in Figure 1C and D); site IV.4 is in the glycan cap, and sites IV.5\u2013IV.7 and V.8\u2013V.9 are located in the MLD of EBOV-GP. The frequency of the antibody captured phage clones displaying these 25 antigenic sites by SAB-132 and SAB-139 antibodies was evaluated. No antibodies bound to previously described antigenic regions I, II, III, IV, and V or antigenic sites II.1, III.1, and V.3 (represented by gray bars with gray letters in Figure 1C) that were recognized by antibodies induced by a live rVSV\u2206G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in humans [11]. The EBOV/SUDV GP DNA vaccine (SAB-132) induced a higher frequency of antibodies that bound primarily to antigenic sites IV.1, IV.2, IV.4, and IV.5 in the GP glycan cap and V.1 and V.2. in the MLD. The rGP vaccine (SAB-139) induced antibodies that predominantly recognized antigenic sites IV.6 in the MLD, V.7 and V9 in the C-terminus of GP1, and site VI in GP2. Taken together, the results from the EBOV-GP GFPDL affinity selection showed that the rGP nanoparticle vaccine induced a more diverse antibody repertoire than the DNA vaccine, and the antibodies recognized a wider range of epitopes in the EBOV GP.",

In previous studies, SPR using His6-tag captured protein on HTG chips with a panel of conformation-dependent GP-specific neutralizing MAbs confirmed conservation of native GP structure. However, these MAbs lost binding to rGP that was amine-coupled directly to GLC chips, suggesting partial denaturation of the GP and loss of conformational epitopes [11]. The negative control-purified TcB IgG showed very low reactivity (<5 RU at 1 mg/mL total IgG concentration) to rGPs in SPR. SAB-139 (rGP nanoparticle-induced IgG) showed 2-fold higher binding to native homologous EBOV rGP compared with SAB-132 (DNA vaccine-induced IgG) (Figure 2A). Binding of these 2 antibody preparations was also evaluated to the N-terminal half of GP (1\u2013308 residues) containing the RBD (GP-RBD) and lacking the highly glycosylated MLD. Surface plasmon resonance antibody analysis showed that antibody binding for both SAB-132 and SAB-139 IgG to the GP-RBD was >3-fold lower than binding to complete rGP ectodomain, confirming the GFPDL analysis (Figure 1) that the majority of the antibodies after vaccination in these 2 IgG preparations recognized epitopes primarily in MLD. The 2 IgG preparations showed equivalent antibody binding levels to the partially denatured rGP\u2019s, suggesting that the rGP nanoparticle-induced antibodies (SAB-139) recognized conformation-dependent epitopes that were sensitive to partial denaturation in this SPR binding assays (Figure 2A). However, the EBOV/SUDV DNA vaccine-generated antibodies (SAB-132) recognized nonconformational/linear epitopes that were not impacted by low pH-mediated denaturation in the SPR assay.",

That difference in antibody affinity between SAB-132 and SAB-139 was highly diminished when partially denatured rGPs were used, confirming that the high-affinity binding of SAB-139 IgG after GP nanoparticle immunization was primarily due to conformational-dependent epitope-specific antibodies, whereas the DNA-vaccinated SAB-132 antibodies have higher level of antibodies specific for linear/denatured epitopes in EBOV GP.",

However, the efficacy of humoral immune response after vaccination against EBOV depends on the vaccine platforms and the animal models used in such studies. Understanding the immune correlates of protection against EBOV is essential for the development of an effective vaccine as well as antibody-based therapeutics. Several MAbs, polyclonal antibody preparations, and convalescent sera from nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans have shown variable efficacy in different EBOV animal model challenge studies. KZ52 is an example of a MAb that controls infection in a small animal model but not in NHPs [15, 16]. Cocktails of MAbs or polyclonal antibodies have been developed to increase the breadth of protection that can be passively transferred with the goal of decreasing EVD severity. Transchromosomal bovines have recently been developed to produce large quantities of human IgGs that can be used for passive immunization against various pathogens including EBOV [4, 5, 9, 10].",

The rGP based nanoparticle vaccine (SAB-139) induced more diverse GP-specific antibody repertoire than the EBOV/SUDV DNA-encoded GP vaccine (SAB-132) as determined by unbiased GFPDL approach. Although both vaccines induced similar antibody epitope profiles in the glycan and MLD, which has been previously identified to be recognized by some protective MAbs, the antibodies induced by the rGP vaccine recognized more antigenic sites of the EBOV GP, which could potentially include more, so far unknown, protective epitopes within these antigenic sites. The DNA vaccine-induced antibodies that recognized antigenic site V.8, which includes the epitope of protective antibody 6D8 [17, 18], whereas the rGP vaccine-induced antibodies that bound antigenic site V.9, which includes the known epitope of protective MAb 13F6 [18]. To compare the amounts of antibodies against these V.8 (394\u2013405) and V.9 (399\u2013414) site epitopes identified using GFPDL, SPR was performed with respective synthetic peptides. SAB-132 and SAB-139 binding profile against the 2 peptides (V.8 and V.9) demonstrated differential recognition of epitopes of these antibody preparations for the 2 overlapping antigenic sites. However, neither of the vaccines generated significant binding antibodies to the fusion loop of GP that is recognized by the anti-pan ebolavirus antibodies, CA45, ADI-15742, and ADI-15878 [19, 20]. Because the DNA vaccine contains both EBOV and SUDV GP-encoding sequence in the plasmid, it is possible that DNA vaccination induced antibodies in the SAB-132 IgG preparation recognizing the common conserved epitopes of Zaire and Sudan EBOV GP in the glycan cap region (residues 282\u2013305) [11]. However, DNA vaccination did not induce significant binding antibodies in GP2 region that have high sequence conservation between EBOV and SUDV.",

The difference in antibody response was not only quantitative but also qualitative. Antibody affinity after nanoparticle vaccination to native GP was 4-fold higher compared with the DNA vaccine-induced antibodies. However, this trend was specific for affinity to the native GP, because the antibody affinity to the denatured form of GP was higher for DNA vaccine-induced IgG compared with the nanoparticle protein-based vaccine. These findings may suggest differences in processing of the native intact GP nanoparticle and DNA-encoded GP expression in host cells after immunization by the TcB immune system. The level of GP expression/secretion in vivo, after plasmid DNA vaccination, cannot be easily determined. Furthermore, the 2 vaccine platforms may also differ in the levels of CD4+ T helper cells and T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells induced. The Tfh play an important role in antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers. In BALB/c mice challenge studies with mouse-adapted (ma) EBOV strain, 7 of 10 mice treated with the 100 mg/kg SAB-132 (V3) IgG and 9 of 10 mice treated with 100 mg/kg SAB-139 (V2) IgG intraperitoneally 1 day postchallenge survived the lethal EBOV infection [9, 10]. The greater antibody epitope diversity and antibody affinities observed for the SAB-139 (rGP vaccine) compared with SAB-132 (DNA vaccine) may explain the better in vitro neutralization as well as in vivo protective efficacy observed for the SAB-139 IgG preparation in the previous mice challenge studies [9, 10].",
