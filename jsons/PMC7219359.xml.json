P waves are noted at cycle length of 1200 msec (50 bpm) and AV dissociation is noted. This is consistent with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and not a supraventricular rhythm with ST-elevation MI. The QRS morphology suggests origin from inferoseptal left ventricle. A junctional ectopic tachycardia with V-A block is also a less likely possibility. Figure 2 shows that a slower tachycardia (123 bpm) with QRS width of 148 msec. There is a significant loss of R wave across precordial leads and no discernible P-waves noted. Premature ventricular contractions are noted which appear to reset the tachycardia which could suggest a reentrant mechanism vs. fortuitous cycle length variation. There is no prior history of MI or Q waves in inferior leads. This is likely ventricular tachycardia originating from inferoapical left ventricular septum.",

(2, 3) During the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, a case of myocarditis was reported. (4) Acute viral myocarditis can be fulminant and may sometimes mimic acute MI and cause arrhythmias. (5) Patients with COVID-19 can deteriorate rapidly with shock and multi-organ failure. There are also reports suggesting significant cardiac injury and arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients (6, 7). Fulminant myocarditis has been reported in COVID-19 patients (8) While it is possible that COVID-19 was a mere bystander in this patient, his history of COVID-19 related symptoms, acute respiratory failure, atypical EKG findings as well a precipitous course point towards myocarditis.",
