In contrast, the AA genotype associated with prostate cancer is frequent in African Americans compared with Caucasians. For the sake of brevity, we propose that the higher incidence of prostate cancer in African Americans may be caused by absence of the GG genotype; however, a larger cohort and specific biologic endpoint measurements, such as the effect of this genotype on expression, enzyme activity, apoptosis, proliferation, and other yet unknown biologic activities, are needed to support this statement.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 719, "end": 728, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 803, "end": 825, "text": "(PERLEGEN [ss24415263]", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "OAS1 Polymorphism and Prostate Cancer/Mandal et al"}, {"text": "The rs2660 genotype is in linkage disequilibrium with rs10774671. 32 The G and A alleles in rs10774671 govern splicing to the last OAS1 exon (exon 7), which harbors rs2660. The GG genotype (in rs10774671) retains the splice site, resulting in high enzyme activity; whereas the AA genotype disrupts the splice site, leading to low enzyme activity. 32 Because of altered splicing, the 3 genotypes reportedly generate different OAS1 isoforms: p46 (GG), p46 and p48 (AG), and p48 (AA). 38 The p46 and p48 isoforms have identical exons 1 through 6 but divergent exon 7. As expected, Two transcripts corresponding to p46 (approximately 500 bp) and p48 (approximately 400 bp) isoforms were observed in the PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines, which harbor the AG genotype (rs2660), using primer pairs spanning exons 3 through 7. Surprisingly, LNCaP cells, which also have the heterozygous AG genotype, did not express any of the OAS1 spliced variants, suggesting a splicing event 5 0 from exon 3 or between exons 3 and 7. In addition to rs2660, rs10774671 also is in linkage disequilibrium with rs1051042 and rs3177979 (all on exon 7). 32 It will be interesting to investigate whether the proposed linkage disequilibrium exists between this block in prostate cancer cells and in our sample set. The rs1131454 SNP (previously rs3741981) in the evolutionary conserved exon 3 also is nonsynonymous (G!A allele results in G!S amino acid change) and is close to the double-stranded RNA binding domain of all OAS1 isoforms.

(A) The structure of the OAS1 gene reveals isoform 1 (p46/E18), Isoform 2 (p42/E16), and Isoform 3 (p48/9-2). Exons are designated A through E. The last exons in isoform 1 (p46/E18) and Isoform 3 (p48/9-2) are not labeled. The nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1131454 (nucleotide, guanine to adenine [G!A]; protein, glycine to serine [G!S]) appears in all isoforms. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs2660 (G!A) is located in the last exon in Isoform 3 (p48/9-2), resulting in a glycine-to-arginine (G!R) amino acid in the 3 0 -untranslated region in isoform 1 (p46/E18). The SNP rs34137742 (C!T) is in the intron between exons B and C. (B) A typical restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to confirm the rs1131454 SNP with Tau1 restriction digest of the amplified genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment using the primer pairs described in the text (see Materials and Methods). (C) Reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out on messenger RNA isolated from LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cells using the primer pairs described in the text (see Materials and Methods). These primers were designed to differentially amplify OAS1 Isoforms 1 (p46) and 3 (p48), resulting in approximately 500-base pair (bp) and 400-bp bands, respectively. (D) OAS1 protein expression is observed in prostate cancer cell lines with Western blot analysis. Whole cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis with antibody against OAS1 and b-actin as a loading control.
