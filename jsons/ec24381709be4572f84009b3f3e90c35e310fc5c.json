            "text": "This study by Boldanova et al. addresses an important question in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) field: to what extent does the virus itself -and not secondary effects coming from immune/interferon responses, immune cell infiltration or similar -reprogram hepatic gene expression? An intriguing, additional facet to this issue is that HCV requires the liver-specific miRNA, miR-122, for its replication, a discovery made by Peter Sarnow lab a decade ago (Science 2005) that has led to high interest in HCV-host gene expression interactions ever since. Recent cell culture studies by Bob Darnell's lab (Cell 2015) have led to the suggestion that miR-122 sequestration by HCV derepresses endogenous hepatocyte transcripts and thus directly and supposedly specifically reprograms the host cell transcriptome. Finally, and of clinical importance, it has been known for many years that endogenous interferon responses to HCV in patients can be rather variable and predict the success of interferon treatment therapy (absence of endogenous response leads to better outcomes of IFN treatment). An obvious question is thus also whether endogenous and exogenous IFN lead to qualitatively or quantitatively different gene expression responses that could underlie the observed therapeutic differences. The one difficulty that has hampered progress in answering these seemingly obvious questions is of course the lack of a good HCV animal model and the reliance on human (or, in some cases, primate monkey) material. The study is based on human material from HCV patients with either high endogenous IFN or such with low endogenous IFN (before and after IFN treatment), plus healthy (non HCV) controls. The last author (Necsulea) has a distinguished bioinformatics background, which shows in an expert and rigorous transcriptomics analysis throughout the manuscript. My prediction is that the datasets will thus serve as an influential reference for HCV researchers -which is one of the important values of the study altogether. Main findings are that (1) many of the observed gene expression changes (low IFN) stem from immune cell infiltration rather than intrinsic cellular reprogramming; (2) that the gene expression changes engendered by endogenous vs. exogenous/therapeutic IFN are probably mainly of quantitative rather than qualitative nature and that (3) the previously published trans-effect of miR-122 sequestration (see above, Cell 2015) on endogenous mRNAs is not specific for targets of this miRNA and may therefore rather be an unspecific effect altogether. (4) However, the authors propose a specific miR effect that occurs via the transcriptional downregulation of several miR loci.",

Although I understand that the authors restricted this analysis to the known IFN effectors, I think it would be helpful to show all/more genes with a similar response, even if they are not yet known as IFN effectors. This information is in principle already there (one of the Suppl. Tables), but I find it difficult to extract this gene set from the genome-wide tables. Can the authors provide a better table/list with these genes and, depending on how many there are, even a Suppl. This study examines the effects of the endogenous interferon (IFN) and post-treatment pegylated IFN (pegIFN)/ribavirin responses on the overall gene expression profile in liver biopsy samples taking from HCV-infected patients. One interesting conclusion is that, while qualitatively similar, the IFN-stimulated gene expression profile was quantitatively different plus/minus pegIFN treatment. This finding offers an explanation why the endogenous IFN response fails to clear HCV. Another important result was the finding that IFN-response gene expression was provided by infiltrating cells of the immune system and not by cell-intrinsic signaling alterations. This study is perfectly executed using high quality bioinformatics analysis. The description and discussion of the results are very scholarly. As the authors know, pre-miR 122 is modulated in a circadian rhythm in the mouse liver. However, mature miR-122 is very stable, at least in the mouse liver or in cultured human liver cells. Thus, it is imperative to examine the abundance of mature miR-122.",

This should be done either globally (small RNA-seq / arrays) or specifically for some miRNAs (RT-PCR). In particular, it is difficult to imagine how downregulation of certain pri-miRs at some time-points only (Fig. 8A ) can lead to global effects at the target level (Fig. 8C) .

            "text": "That being said, we agree with both reviewers that data on the mature levels of the miRNAs would provide important support to our observations on primary miRNA transcripts and miRNA target genes. We would like to stress that, in the case of miR-122, previous publications have already shown that its mature miRNA levels are affected by IFN. To directly evaluate aspect in our study, we selected three miRNAs whose primary transcripts were shown to be down-regulated after pegIFNa treatment (miR-122-5p, miR-146a-5p and miR-331-3p) and quantified their expression levels before and after pegIFNa treatment, by qPCR. For all three miRNAs, this data indicates that the mature miRNAs are indeed down-regulated after pegIFNa treatment at the 16h time-point (also at the 96h time-point for miR-122-5p and miR-146a-5p, Supplementary Figure 10 , Supplementary Table 12) . Thus, mature miRNA levels indeed appear to be down-regulated by pegIFNa treatment, at least for these three cases. Unfortunately, for several biopsies we did not have enough RNA left to perform qPCR, which makes this analysis considerably less powerful than our RNA-seq analysis of primary miRNA transcripts. For the same reason, we could not evaluate miRNA expression with small RNA-seq or arrays. We have presented this qPCR data in the revised manuscript (pages 13-14 and 26 of the revised text, Supplementary  Fig. 10 , Supplementary Table 12) . We focused on the 16h time point in Figure 8C because most changes in pri-miRNA transcripts (as well as in other classes of genes) were observed at this time point. Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have repeated the analysis of miRNA target genes for the other 4 time points, shown in Supplementary Figures 11 and 12 . This analysis shows that the effect on miRNA target genes is not found at the other 4 time points, that is, the miRNAs whose primary transcripts are downregulated do not stand out from the bulk of liver-expressed miRNAs at other time points. This result is consistent with our analysis of the temporal dynamics of interferon-induced gene expression, as the strongest changes following pegIFNa treatment were also observed at the 16h time point, for most gene categories ( Figure 5) . We have added a comment on this aspect in the text (page 14 in the revised manuscript), as follows:",

A principal component analysis and a hierarchical clustering approach based on pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients among samples (both applied to the set of pegIFNa-stimulated genes) both indicated that high ISG samples are similar to the later time points in the pegIFNa treatment. Indeed, high ISG samples clustered with pegIFNatreated samples from the 48h, 96h and 144h time points, in both analyses ( Figure S7 ), while the 4h and 16h time points stand out from the other samples. This observation is consistent with the lower induction levels of ISGs observed for the later pegIFNa time points and for the high ISG samples. We have discussed this analysis in the revised manuscript (page 12): Fig. 7) . Both clustering methods indicated that high ISG samples are globally similar in expression patterns to the later time points in the pegIFNa treatment (48h, 96h and 144h).\" To address this point, we performed a more general analysis of the pegIFNa-affected genes that are not differentially expressed in high ISG patients. We thus selected the protein-coding genes that were strongly up-regulated or down-regulated (minimum expression fold change 2, maximum FDR 0.01) in response to peg IFNa treatment for at least two time points, but which were not differentially expressed in high ISG samples compared to low ISG samples (FDR>0.1). We also searched for genes which showed the opposite expression pattern in high ISG samples (e.g., upregulated by pegIFNa but down-regulated in high ISG samples), but we found none. We found 85 genes up-regulated and 15 genes down-regulated by pegIFNa, which are not differentially expressed between high ISG and low ISG samples. We displayed their expression patterns in Figure S8 . These genes include antiviral effectors like APOBEC3G and OASL, which is potentially relevant for the inability of patients with high endogenous ISG levels to spontaneously clear the viral infection. Overall, figure S8 shows that there is a tendency for up-regulation or down-regulation for these genes in high ISG samples compared to low ISG samples, but at lower levels and with more variability among individuals. Thus, this analysis confirms our initial observation that differences between the endogenous and exogenous IFN response is mainly quantitative rather than qualitative.

While we agree with the reviewer that this analysis would be relevant, unfortunately our dataset does not include enough patients with low viral loads to address this point. At this point, we cannot propose an explanation for this finding. IRF2 is the most striking candidate for a qualitative difference between endogenous/exogenous IFN response, among the analyzed set of potential antiviral effectors. In our discussion, we mention that IRF2 is a transcription factor (page 17 of the revised manuscript) simply to clarify that the analyzed gene set also includes genes with indirect antiviral action, and does not exclusively consist of direct antiviral effectors. However, we do not claim that the IRF2 pattern can be attributed to its function as a transcription factor. As mentioned in the main text (page 13 of the revised manuscript), all cases where a primary miRNA transcript was significantly differentially expressed following pegIFNa treatment are instances of down-regulation. All of these cases are shown in Figure 8A . In this figure, we can indeed observe positive (albeit weak) expression fold changes at the 144h time point for 6 out of 11 transcripts, but these are never statistically significant. Thus, we have not discussed this pattern further in the manuscript.",
