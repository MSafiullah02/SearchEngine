We discuss the airline industry oligopoly structure, the economic and exogenous milieu of airline transport and travel decision making, and the impacts of technological change on airlines and consumers, as well as the current state of the industry.

Since oligopoly firms produce similar outputs and compete with their industry rivals, any action an oligopoly firm takes is noticed by its competitors. Consequently, rivals may react with price-cutting or other attempts to enhance market share. Thus, the firms in an oligopoly are interdependent, and each recognizes that its market power is vulnerable to erosion by competitors or new market entrants.",

Even before the devastating terrorist attacks, the airline industry experienced effects of the economic slowdown that began in early 2000; the industry continued to languish, despite receiving $5 billion in government grants following the terrorist attacks (Becker 2001) . The recession and slow economic growth reduced the business travel base, on which airlines depend for their most lucrative sales of high-priced seats. Rising unemployment levels increased consumer hesitancy to purchase leisure travel. Consumer discretionary travel was further affected by decreased household asset values, due to substantial stock market declines. The wealth effect that fueled the extended expansion of airline travel during the 1990s operated in reverse as consumer assets diminished. Newman (2003) notes that the market for air travel is changing in unanticipated ways that indicate continuing slow growth in passenger travel even without a new terrorist incident. Sharkey (2003) projects that domestic passenger travel is unlikely to reach the 2000 level of almost 700 million until 2008.",

Brander and Zhang (1990) conclude that this provides a type of product differentiation, possibly allowing premium fares. Berry (1990) indicates that consumers put a higher value (willingness to pay a higher fare) on a hub airport at their origin than at their destination. An added consequence of hub domination is the ability to engage in predatory pricing to ward off market entrants, especially new low-fare carriers. Another problem at hub airports is that large carriers often control longterm gate leases, making it difficult for new entrants to gain access to gates at an airport dominated by a single carrier (Bailey 2002) . Although the hub system plays an important role in aggregating passengers, reliance upon one airport as an integral part of an airline's route infrastructure can cause significant noneconomic problems for both consumers and airlines. For instance, an external disruption at a hub airport, such as a severe weather event or air traffic control problem, may paralyze a large airline's entire operation. The hub airport problems, resulting in longer delays and travel time, increase the demand for direct flights, especially by business flyers with time constraints and higher time costs than leisure consumers.",

With more Internet ticket purchases, increasing ticket price transparency and competition will maintain downward pressure on prices. However, ticket prices will be supplemented with more fees, surcharges, and taxes for security costs. For example, the 2003 excise tax on airline tickets was 22%, an 8% increase in a decade (National Public Radio 2003) . Due to the high price elasticity for leisure travel, airlines pass these charges forward as surcharges to consumers, who ultimately bear the burden of paying for increased security.",

A market may have more than one airport (e.g., the New York City metropolitan area). For purposes of this figure a \"hub,\" as defined by the Department of Transportation, may not be a hub airport for an airline; however, most large markets contain at least one airline hub. the number of direct or point-to-point flights will increase. While the huband-spoke system will remain in some reduced form, direct flights will become more feasible as major airlines use smaller, more cost-efficient regional jets for smaller markets (Sharkey 2003) .",

Although consolidation may increase market power of large merging airlines, such power will not go unchecked. Attracted by potential profits, additional low-fare competitors are expected to enter the fray. Profit margins for new entrants will become more attractive as the cost gap widens between low-cost carriers and larger established airlines. New entrants will fill niche markets, serving particular regions of the country or providing point-to-point service to selected markets. Because low-fare carriers serve as an effective curb against noncompetitive oligopolistic airline pricing, antitrust measures may be required to allow vulnerable start-ups to compete with existing oligopolists.",

            "text": "Three possible future airline market structure paradigms are depicted in Table 1 . Features of three alternative industry structures related to each of the market scenarios are listed, with anticipated economic behavior deriving from competitive characteristics and the resulting effects on consumers. The first column presents the current oligopoly market structure, and the second and third columns present potential future alternatives. One future paradigm (column 2) envisions a strongly oligopolistic industry, but with substantial competition from low-fare regional airlines, and the other (column 3) presents a comparable oligopoly without the moderating impact of robust lowfare carriers. Mann (2001) expresses concern that continued consolidation of market power into a ''Big Three'' or ''Big Four'' scenario may lead to declines in service and higher prices. We conclude that it is unlikely the airline industry will maintain its current state. Thus, as illustrated in Table 1 , consumers will be impacted by major changes in the airline industry. The airline industry is experiencing its greatest changes since deregulation. Economic developments, including increased competition from new low-fare airlines, are forcing the major airlines to become more efficient. Recent noneconomic occurrences have exacerbated the challenges caused by economic factors. Changes in technology and industry practices have resulted in substantially enhanced price transparency and more timeefficient flight options. However, the airline industry will likely remain unstable, and some price increases are inevitable due to increasing costs, particularly for fuel and security. Thus, traveling consumers will have roles both in shaping and in adapting to the dramatic changes taking place in the airline industry.",
