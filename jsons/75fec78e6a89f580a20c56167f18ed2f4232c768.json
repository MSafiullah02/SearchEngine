Red CSF indicates hemorrhage; typically this is iatrogenic due to penetration of radicular or meningeal blood vessels. Confirmation of a traumatic tap can be determined via centrifugation, which clears iatrogenic hemorrhage. If red or yellow color persists, this typically indicates chronic hemorrhage. Yellow or straw-tinged CSF is referred to as xanthochromic, and it suggests prior subarachnoid hemorrhage (in the absence of hyperbilirubinemia). Xanthochromia is caused by an accumulation of blood pigments such as hemoglobin, and it may occur within several hours of an acute hemorrhagic insult (trauma, bleeding disorders and occasionally severe CNS inflammation).",

A close assessment for microorganisms, index of mitosis, and neoplasia should be completed. The utility of the cytospin is that the cytocentrifugation process concentrates all of the cells in a volume of 0.5-1.0 mL of CSF. In the case of a marked pleocytosis, 200 mL typically is sufficient for a differential cell count. If a cytospin is not available, a sedimentation chamber also provides reliable cell counts. Some labs prefer that protein (fetal calf serum or hetastarch) is added to CSF samples to improve cytospin preparations. 3 This is not critical when CSF samples have a total protein (TP) elevation.",

            "text": "Cross-sectional imaging: Although it may be necessary to delay cross-sectional imaging until neurologic signs stabilize, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans may be valuable in the critical patient. Both imaging modalities typically require general anesthesia, so the decision to perform MRI or CT scan is made on a case-by-case basis. MRI is the gold-standard imaging modality for intracranial disease, as it provides excellent soft-tissue resolution, at times strongly reflective of the gross histopathology associated with specific encephalopathy. Although there are overlapping imaging features among intracranial disorders, MRI often directs the presumptive antemortem diagnosis. The major drawback of MRI, particularly in the critical patient, is that it is a slow imaging modality, especially with low field strength magnets. Conversely, CT scan is a quick imaging tool and may be particularly useful in the acute neurologic patient (eg, head trauma). Despite the limited soft tissue detail provided by CT scan, when coupled with CSF analysis, it may help to provide evidence of ME. The imaging features for several inflammatory brain diseases have been described 4, 5 ; however, the CT appearance of ME is variable and nonspecific. The presence or absence of contrast enhancement with inflammatory brain disease depends upon the degree of BBB breakdown. 5, 6 Despite the fact that it cannot definitively differentiate among disease processes, CT scan may be especially useful for localizing lesions before brain biopsy. An important limitation of CT scan is that it produces a beam hardening artifact (due to preferential absorption of low energy x-ray beams), most notably adjacent to the petrous parts of the temporal bones. This artifact may obscure the clinician's ability to interpret brainstem and cerebellar lesions.",

Serologic testing may be evaluated using serum or CSF, or both. Typical antibody titers evaluated in canine and feline CNS diseases include: Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia rickettsii, and Coccidiodes immitis. Antigen testing, when available (eg, Cryptococcus antigen testing), may circumvent problems associated with the interpretation of antibody testing. Antigen testing, however, may be insensitive because it requires the presence of the organisms in the biological sample under evaluation. In the acute neurologic patient, the authors recommend evaluating antibody titers for regional infectious diseases and also for pathogens to which animals may have been exposed during travel ( Figure 2 ). Although antibody titers reflect direct exposure to the organism, a positive titer does not confirm active infection; titers must be evaluated in the context of the patient's signalment, history, clinical signs, and neuro-imaging results. The clinician should recall that IgM and IgG antibodies reflect acute and chronic infections, respectively. As such, a mildly elevated IgM titer in an acute neurologic patient (with no previous neurologic or systemic disease) may support an infectious etiology, whereas elevated IgG titers may be indicative of previous exposure to a pathogen or vaccination, rather than active disease.",

Finally, it should be noted that a negative PCR result does not definitively rule out infectious ME for 3 important reasons: (1) nucleic acids may be present in CSF, but at undetectable levels; (2) nucleic acids from organisms may be present in the CNS parenchyma but not in the CSF; and (3) the disorder may have been triggered by a pathogen that is no longer present. There are several permutations of PCR biotechnology used in the veterinary and human medicine including conventional PCR, multiplex PCR (mPCR), reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and consensus and degenerate PCR.",

            "text": "Conventional PCR can be utilized to test for the presence of DNA from infectious agents. To perform PCR, DNA must first be extracted from a biological sample (eg, CSF) along with the DNA of the patient. After extraction, DNA is combined with various reagents including 2 oligonucleotide primers (short DNA sequences complementary to flanking ends of a target DNA sequence), a DNA polymerase and individual nucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine). Initially, the mixture is heated to a high temperature to separate the DNA double helix into individual strands. Next, the temperature is lowered to promote the annealing of the PCR primers to the target DNA, and then raised slightly, to promote the addition of nucleotides to a growing strand of DNA (a so-called amplicon). This process is repeated 25-45 times, exponentially amplifying the DNA sequence of interest. Conventional PCR is utilized routinely to test for DNA from Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Borrelia spp., T. gondii, N. caninum, and many bacteria and fungi. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Nested PCR A variant of classical PCR termed nested PCR is utilized for analysis of specimens in which very few pathogen particles are presumed to be present (such as CSF), with the goal of substantially increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR. 24 In nested PCR, the first PCR is followed by an additional amplification with a second set of primers, which are complementary to sequences internal to the sequence targeted by the first set of primers.",

            "text": "RT-PCR is used to identify nucleic acids from viruses with an RNA genome. Because the initial targeted nucleic acid is RNA, the enzyme RT must be utilized to first create a complimentary strand of DNA (cDNA) from the original RNA. Subsequently, the cDNA is amplified as per conventional PCR above. RT-PCR has been utilized to aid in the diagnosis of various CNS viral infections including feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), CDV, Borna virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. [25] [26] [27] mPCR mPCR is a permutation of conventional PCR that allows for the simultaneous amplification of 2 or more DNA targets. This requires a PCR primer pair for each microorganism or host gene under investigation. While the technique has the potential to amplify several pathogens simultaneously, multiplex reactions may have lower sensitivities than standard singleplex reactions due to competition of multiple primer pairs and PCR reagents or preferential amplification of one amplicon over the other. 28 We have used mPCR successfully to amplify both T. gondii and N. caninum from cases of canine ME. 29 qPCR qPCR allows for objective quantification of a target nucleic acid in a given sample. With this technique, a fluorescent probe binds the target DNA sequence (or a fluorescent marker is intercalated into the amplicon), and the PCR product can be quantified by a specialized thermocycler. This method has several advantages over conventional PCR, including the elimination of post-amplification steps and the potential for increased sensitivity due to the use of fluorescent markers. 30 Quantitative real-time PCR allows one to observe the quantification cycles of the PCR amplicon simultaneously while the reaction is being performed. 31 qPCR assays are available for CDV, T. gondii, Bartonella spp., and canine rickettsial organisms (R. rickettsii, E. canis). [32] [33] [34] Consensus and degenerate PCR Genome-based assays, including PCR-based assays, are powerful tools to detect pathogens, but are limited to individual pathogen species. Broadly reactive methods including consensus and degenerate PCR have been developed to identify novel or unsuspected pathogens in idiopathic diseases. Consensus PCR targets highly conserved genomic regions that are present in all members of a pathogen family or genera. With consensus PCR, amplicons must be subject to sequence analysis to determine their identity. An example of consensus PCR is eubacterial, or so-called universal bacterial PCR, which typically targets the highly conserved bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. In human neurology, eubacterial PCR on CSF has been shown to be more sensitive than CSF culture for the diagnosis of a bacterial ME, 35 but contamination and the potential for false positive results present a major challenge with this diagnostic test.",

However, with degenerate PCR a mixture of PCR primers is utilized to account for minor variations in one or more nucleotide positions in the targeted DNA region. As for consensus PCR, positive PCR products must be sequenced to determine their identity. This methodology has demonstrated the presence of herpes viruses in several animal diseases previously considered idiopathic or thought to have autoimmune pathogenesis, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes viruslike herpes viruses in chimps and gorillas, 36 a novel g-2-herpes virus in chimpanzees, 37 and a novel herpes virus in tortoises. 38 Degenerate PCR also was utilized in landmark investigations for the identification of Bartonella henselae as the elusive pathogen responsible for bacillary angiomatosis in 1990, 39 and Tropheryma whippelii as the cause for Whipple's disease in 1991/1992. 40 A third, emerging PCR technique is a combination of consensus and degenerate PCR that utilizes consensus degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide (CODEHOP) primers. This methodology not only amplifies nucleic acids from known members of a microbial family or genera, but is optimized to detect novel microbes due to the evolutionary relationships of the organisms. CODE-HOP PCR has been used successfully to identify and characterize a number of novel human viruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, 41 hepatitis G, 42 Sin Nombre virus, 43 Human retrovirus-5, 44 and novel animal viruses such as the macaque g-herpes virus and pig endogenous retrovirus. 44, 45 Recently, we have utilized pan-viral CODEHOP PCR screening strategies in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in ongoing investigations of canine MUE. 46 Microarray analysis Microarray analysis has emerged as a leading technology in molecular biology over the past decade. With this technology, hundreds to thousands of DNA sequences are arranged on a microchip for subsequent DNA or RNA hybridization studies. There are several diagnostic techniques and applications that utilize microarray technology including gene expression profiling, single nucleotide polymorphism detection, comparative genomic hybridization, chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip, alternative splicing detection, tiling arrays, and infectious disease diagnostic testing. 47 In human neurology, microarray analysis has been utilized to detect the presence of infectious agents in cases of MUE. 48, 49 Some labs report that microarray analysis has similar sensitivity and specificity to conventional PCR. 50 The advantage of this technique is that it allows for screening of multiple pathogens simultaneously; in theory, hundreds of microorganisms. Moreover, the technique is not biased toward specific or regional pathogens; therefore, a priori knowledge of potential infectious organisms is not necessary. The disadvantage is that microarray studies require sophisticated and expensive instrumentation. The potential role of this biotechnology in the veterinary setting remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Infectious causes for acute MEM are proven infrequently in veterinary medicine, but are important differentials nonetheless. Infectious differentials for MEM should be pursued vigorously to help differentiate infectious MEM from autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. Pathogens that may cause canine or feline MEM include bacteria, viruses, protozoa, fungi, and rarely rickettsia and parasites (Table 4 ). Infectious MEM occurs most commonly in young or immunocompromised animals; however, any dog or cat may develop MEM. Some infectious agents are capable of affecting multiple organ systems in addition to the CNS, which may prove helpful in distinguishing CNS infections from autoimmune/idiopathic meningoencephalitides ( Figure 3 ). The severity of CNS infection is dependent on several factors including: the status of the animal's immune system at the time of inoculation, strength of the animal's immune response during active infection, nutritional status of the animal, strain and virulence factors of the infectious agent, and environmental factors. Here we review the most common infectious CNS diseases in the dog and cat and the conventional and novel molecular diagnostic tests used to detect them in CSF and other tissues. Diagnostic testing: With bacterial ME, CSF typically has a marked elevation in neutrophils and TP. CSF cultures may be positive but often show no growth (occasionally, even in cases where bacteria are visualized in the CSF). MRI may be normal or may disclose the presence of diffuse or focal meningeal enhancement, ventriculitis, and possibly brain edema. Alternatively, MRI may disclose the presence of a focal abscess. In the case of otitis media/interna, with central extension to the brainstem, a contiguous contrast-enhancing lesion may be present in the inner ear (and tympanic bullae) and the brainstem with adjacent meningeal enhancement.",

            "text": "Diagnostic testing: While CNS histopathology and immunohistochemistry typically provide postmortem confirmation of CNS CDV infection, 58, 59 antemortem diagnosis of CNS CDV infection is more challenging. Because CSF and MRI findings are highly variable with CDV infection, 60 diagnostic techniques with greater specificity are needed. Immunohistochemical testing for CDV antigen on biopsies of nasal mucosa, footpad epithelium, and the haired skin of the dorsal neck has been reported to detect CDV antigen in 88% (24/27 cases from epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa) to 96% (26/27 cases from a skin biopsy of the dorsal neck region), depending on the tissue sampled. 61 Similarly, RT PCR applied to RNA extracted from whole blood, urine, CSF, tonsilar, or conjunctival specimens may help with the diagnosis of CNS CDV infection. 32, [62] [63] [64] Recently, the CDC has reported on a panel of 4 semi-nested RT-PCR assays that utilize CODEHOP primers for the diagnosis of paramyxovirus infections. We have utilized this pan-paramyxovirus PCR to determine CDV as the etiology in an unusual case of necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME). 65 FIPV FIPV is a highly pathogenic mutant variant of the nonpathogenic feline enteric corona virus (FECV). Cats 6 months to 2 years of age are most commonly infected, followed by senior cats 15 years of age or older. 66 Depending on a cat's immunologic response to FIPV, either the effusive (wet) or noneffusive (dry) form may occur. MEM is most commonly associated with noneffusive FIP, with up to 30% of infected cats with clinical signs having neurologic involvement. 67 CNS FIP is characterized by a diffuse meningitis, ependymitis, and adjacent encephalomyelitis. 57 Diagnostic testing: The CSF of cats with neurologic FIP commonly contains a mononuclear to neutrophilic pleocytosis and an elevated TP, although normal CSF does not rule out the disorder. 68 MRI and CT scan may show periventricular or meningeal contrast-enhancement or both, often with hydrocephalus. 68 Definitive diagnosis requires necropsy. Most cases have measurable serum titers to FECV/FIPV, but the immune responses to these 2 organisms are indistinguishable, so it is not possible to discriminate between the two. Occasionally, affected cats will have a negative coronavirus titer. Therefore, serum FIPV titers have a limited role in the diagnosis of FIP infection in cats. One study suggested that 15 of 16 cats had CSF FECV/FIV titers that were higher than expected (given the serum titers and the degree of blood-CSF barrier disturbance). 68 However, this should be interpreted cautiously. Positive RT-PCR of CSF is consistent with clinical FIP, but PCR has been shown to have limited sensitivity in one study (5/ 16 CSF samples and 10/15 brain samples were positive on confirmed cases). 68 Real time qPCR has not been evaluated rigorously in CNS FIP, but has the potential to improve both the specificity of sensitivity of FIPV detection. One RT PCR for FIPV RNA is available through Auburn University that shows promise for differentiating pathogenic from nonpathogenic FIPV infection. However, more studies are required for optimal validation.",

Lymphoplasmacytic meningitis predominates; however, encephalomyelitis may occur when the underlying neuroparenchyma is affected. Although Bartonella spp. are not within the rickettsial family, they are considered here as uncommon causes of canine MEM.

Serologic testing, typically via IFA, can be used to help support a diagnosis of rickettsial infection. Recently, nested PCR was used to evaluate early infection of E. canis in dogs compared with the traditional IFA assay. The PCR assay proved to be a more sensitive test in the early stages of infection before Ehrlichia-induced antibodies were detectable in the serum. 76 We have recently utilized broadly reactive, consensus qPCR assays for Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., and Borrelia spp., in a large cohort of cases of MEM and identified only a single case that was positive for Bartonella DNA. 34 ",

However, the diverse terminology for this disorder sometimes generates confusion among general practitioners and veterinary specialists. The name SRMA is well established in the veterinary literature and best describes the pathologic and clinical features of the disease, being a systemic immune disorder characterized by inflammatory lesions of the leptomeninges and the associated arteries that typically is responsive to corticosteroids. 1 The disorder may occur in any breed of dog, although Beagles, Boxers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Weimaraners, and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are overrepresented. Age of onset is commonly between 6 and 18 months with a range from 4 months to 7 years. 12 SRMA is a sporadic disorder characterized by episodes of profound cervical hyperesthesia, depression, and pyrexia. 1 Clinical signs result from a combined meningitis and arteritis of leptomeningeal vessels. The arteritis also may involve the vessels of the heart, mediastinum, and thyroid glands. 57 Occasionally, SRMA occurs concurrently with immune-mediated polyarthritis. 82 Two forms of SRMA exist including the classic, acute form and the chronic, protracted form. In acute SRMA, dogs most commonly present with hyperesthesia along the vertebral column, cervical rigidity, stiff gait, and fever. 83 Affected animals often manifest a hunched posture with profound guarding of the head and neck, sometimes mimicking a cervical intervertebral disc protrusion. Dogs may be so painful that any manipulation elicits a painful response. A second, more chronic form of SRMA may occur following relapses of acute disease or inadequate treatment. 83 In this form of disease, meningeal fibrosis secondary to the inflammatory process may obstruct CSF flow or occlude the vasculature, rarely causing secondary hydrocephalus or ischemia of the CNS parenchyma, respectively. 59 Involvement of the motor and proprioceptive systems may lead to variable degrees of paresis and ataxia; other neurologic signs such as a menace deficit, anisocoria, or vestibular signs may occur with severe disease.",

Typically, the CSF neutrophils have no toxic changes; however, in severe cases, both banded and segmented neutrophils may be observed. The CSF in the chronic form of SRMA may be variable, consisting of predominantly mononuclear cells or a mixed cell population with normal or mildly elevated TP. 9 Bacterial cultures are negative. Radiographs of the cervical vertebral column are normal. CT scan or MRI may demonstrate contrast enhancement of the meninges. 84 In some dogs, the inflammation also affects the meninges of the brain and the choroid plexus. 85 In both forms of SRMA, diagnostic testing may show a neutrophilia with a left shift, an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and an elevated a-2-globulin fraction. 12 The majority of affected dogs have elevated IgA levels in both the CSF and serum, a finding that is most likely secondary to dysregulation of the immune system. 9, 86, 87 Elevated serum and CSF IgA levels help differentiate SRMA from other idiopathic and infectious canine meningoencephalitides; however, elevated IgA levels may be associated with primary or secondary inflammation. Elevated IgM or IgG, or both, in the CSF also have been documented. 86 More recently, acute phase proteins (APPs), including C-reactive protein (CRP) and a-2-macroglobulin, have been shown to be elevated consistently in the serum of dogs with SRMA. 60 However, elevation of APPs is not pathognomonic for the disorder and other systemic inflammatory diseases should be included in the differential diagnosis when present. Once SRMA has been confirmed, elevated CRP serum concentrations may be used reliably to monitor response to therapy, rather than repeated CSF collection and analyses. 60 These results were confirmed recently by Lowrie et al. 88 Granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (GME) GME is difficult to distinguish from the various forms of MEM on clinical grounds, but may represent up to 25% of canine CNS disease. 86 Typically, GME presents as an acute onset, progressive, focal to multifocal neurologic disease that may be fatal if left untreated. 57, 89 Females and Toy and Terrier breeds are overrepresented for GME; however, both sexes and all breeds may be affected. The mean age of onset of neurologic signs is 55 months (range, 6-144 months). 89 Clinical signs reflect focal or multifocal CNS disease and they are dependent on the lesion location within the neuraxis. Neurologic deficits referable to the caudal fossa (vestibulo-cerebellar signs) and cervical spinal cord, in addition to seizures and visual deficits, have been reported most frequently. 57 Three forms of GME have been described based on both morphological and clinical neurologic abnormalities: disseminated, focal, and ocular. 1 The disseminated form is most common and it typically manifests as an acute onset of rapidly progressive, multifocal neurologic signs involving the cerebrum, caudal brainstem, cerebellum, or cervical or thoracolumbar spinal cord. 89 Neurologic signs associated with the uncommon, focal form of GME typically are slowly progressive and they are suggestive of a single spaceoccupying mass lesion. 89, 90 In the focal form of GME, solitary granuloma-like lesions may form in the cerebrum, caudal fossa, or spinal cord. 57 Focal GME must be differentiated from CNS malignant histiocytosis and primary CNS lymphosarcoma. The ocular form of GME manifests with an acute onset of visual impairment, variable pupillary changes (commonly dilated and unresponsive), variable degrees of optic nerve swelling, and occasionally chorioretinitis, especially in the nontapetal fundus. 57, 90, 91 Dogs with ocular GME may concurrently have or progress to develop disseminated CNS lesions.",

In most cases, a presumptive antemortem diagnosis is achieved via a multimodal approach that includes: assessment of case signalment, neurologic signs and neuroanatomic localization, CSF analysis, cross-sectional imaging, and infectious disease testing. The antemortem diagnosis often is complicated by an overlap in the neurodiagnostic profiles (especially between GME, infectious ME, and CNS neoplasia). Therefore, the terminology MUE may be preferable on an antemortem basis in cases of idiopathic ME where histopathologic testing is lacking. 92 In all forms of GME, meningeal inflammation may result in mild to severe CSF mononuclear pleocytosis and a TP elevation; however, the CSF occasionally is normal. Although not specific for GME, the most common MRI findings for the disseminated form include multiple hyperintensities on T2-weighted or fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences scattered throughout the CNS white matter. 93 These lesions typically assume an infiltrative appearance and have irregular margins. Despite the predilection of the GME for white matter, MRI lesions often are distributed throughout both gray and white matter. The lesions have variable intensity on T1-weighted images and have variable degrees of contrast enhancement. 93 Vasogenic edema in the white matter is commonly present on T2-weighted images and appears hyperintense to the neuroparenchyma. Although meningeal enhancement has been described, 84 it is not commonly apparent. Infectious MEM, CNS lymphosarcoma, and less commonly metastatic neoplasms may present with similar MRI findings to disseminated GME, and discriminating among these differentials may be challenging.",
