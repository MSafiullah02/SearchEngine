Similarly, when focusing on the IPF group, the 60-day survival probability in the virus negative patients (n = 22) and positive patients (n = 5) was significantly different (77.3% vs 40%, p = 0.05; Fig. 2B), but the virus infection itself could not predict the poor 60-day survival probability on the simple logistic regression analysis. Comparison of the 60-day survival probability between the IPF (n = 27) and non-IPF ILDs groups (n = 51) was comparable (p = 0.132; Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the survival probability was significantly lower in the UIP group (n = 39) than in the non-UIP group (n = 39, p = 0.022; Fig. 2D); however, the simple logistic regression analysis did not predict the 60-day poor survival rate in patients with UIP pattern. In addition, the presence of COPD, home oxygen therapy, and smoking status could not predict the 60-day mortality rate.",

Tang et al. [2] reported that 97% of stable patients with IPF had one or more herpes viruses (CMV, EBV, HHV7, and HHV8) in their biopsied specimens, which might have contributed to the chronic irritation for antigenic stimulation. Indeed, regardless of the type of interstitial pneumonia, CMV/HHV7 accounted for up to 46.7% (n = 7) of the total isolated respiratory viruses (n = 15) in our study. This has raised concerns about whether or not those viruses truly reflected the current infection or hallmark of latent infection/re-activation. This hypothesis for latent infection or re-activation was reinforced by our results demonstrating (1) no elevation of serum atypical lymphocytes, (2) no definite evidence of inclusion body in the BALF, and (3) absence of pp65 CMV antigenemia in due clinical course. Ushiki et al. [3] reported on 14 cases of IPF in Japan acute exacerbation and found evidence of RSV in one case and CMV in two cases. In Brazil, Santos et al. [7] demonstrated that 10% of IPF acute exacerbation cases exhibited measles or CMV infection Thus, the role of virus infections both in IPF and non-IPF ILDs cases remains obscure; further studies with a higher number of these cases may be required in the future.",

However, the present study reported the first evidence of viral respiratory infections in both IPF and non-IPF ILDs cases with acute exacerbation that required hospital admission. Further accumulation of such cases may be required in future studies to elucidate that the virus detection either indicates latent infection and/or re-activation in the respiratory systems or is a true trigger of acute exacerbation.
