            "text": "Recent research has shed new light on the importance of the right ventricle (RV) in normal cardiac physiology and its prominent role in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). The RV was previously overshadowed by the left ventricle (LV), whose simpler anatomy conforms better to geometric models and is more accessible to non-invasive imaging. Furthermore, early experiments falsely suggested that the RV did not contribute significantly to the generation of cardiac output [1]. However, a series of investigations over the past 25 years have provided greater insight into the RV\u2019s distinct anatomy, its performance under normal physiological conditions, and its adaptations to specific disease states. Advanced imaging, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), has provided critical assistance in the study of the RV, allowing for non-invasive characterization of the RV\u2019s response to stressors, as well as a tool for measuring the success of therapies. As a result, a detailed understanding now exists of the role of the RV in ischemic heart disease, congenital heart disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic left-sided HF. Most importantly, studies have shown that RV failure is a crucial prognostic factor in all of these disease states. In particular, the importance of RV function in left-sided HF may outweigh the importance of LV function in terms of both morbidity and mortality.",

The apex contains prominent trabeculations, in contrast to the smooth, muscular infundibulum. Viewed in cross-section, the RV resembles a crescent that lies over the anterior aspect of the LV. The free wall is thin and the overall mass of the RV is a fraction of the LV mass, despite a larger volume. The deep muscle fibers of the RV have a longitudinal orientation, resulting in a primarily vertical direction of contractile forces. The superficial muscle fibers of the RV are oriented in a more concentric direction and are intertwined with the superficial muscle fibers of the LV. This anatomical interaction between the muscular fibers of the two chambers is also present in the interventricular septum, which is typically displaced into the RV throughout the cardiac cycle. Direct muscular continuity between the LV and RV plays a significant role in ventricular interdependence, which will be discussed in further detail below.",

The longitudinal fibers draw the apex towards the tricuspid valve, while the free wall also moves inward toward the septum. Traction on the free wall is applied by LV contraction at attachment points in the superficial muscle layer. The RV is coupled with the high compliance of the pulmonary vasculature, leading to a pressure-volume relationship that is distinct from the relationship seen in the LV. Whereas the LV continues to generate pressure until the closure of the aortic valve, RV pressure falls prior to the closure of the pulmonic valve. Ejection continues however due to the low resistance within the pulmonary circuit (Fig. 4.1) [2]. The RV takes advantage of this physiology by producing an identical cardiac output to the LV with markedly reduced work and myocardial oxygen demand. However, one consequence of this interaction is the RV\u2019s heightened sensitivity to afterload, which can be deleterious in acute pressure overload states.\n",

Systolic interdependence is mediated by the shared musculature between the LV and the RV, which means that the contractile state of one ventricle can influence the performance of the other ventricle. Diastolic interdependence is a result of the common pericardial sac. The pericardium is unable to stretch acutely in response to ventricular dilatation, and is limited in its ability to accommodate chronic ventricular dilatation. Therefore, a volume load in either chamber will cause displacement of the septum into the other chamber, resulting in a decreased diastolic volume and an impairment of ventricular output (Fig. 4.2) [3]. As the RV is the more compliant chamber, this diastolic interaction most commonly occurs in volume overload states of the RV, such as an atrial septal defect.\n",

Vasoconstriction may be further exacerbated by hypoxemia. The rapid rise in afterload increases RV wall tension, which quickly leads to RV dilatation and RV systolic dysfunction. As the RV pressure rises acutely, the interventricular septum shifts into the LV, reducing LV preload and further compromising cardiac output. Finally, coronary perfusion is impaired by both the compression of the right coronary artery by elevated RV wall stress and the reduction in cardiac output. In the setting of the increased myocardial oxygen demand in the failing RV, the reduction in coronary blood flow leads to a significant supply-demand imbalance. The final consequence of this sequence of events is worsening cardiac output, systemic hypotension and cardiac arrest.",

The immediate result of an RVI is RV free wall dyskinesis due to ischemia, although this alone may not be sufficient to produce clinical RV failure. Secondary effects include stiffening of the myocardium and dilation of the RV. Similar to the consequences of an acute PE, the acute pressure changes within the RV, in this case provoked by diastolic dysfunction, cause septal shifting and impaired LV-RV interaction. In addition septal ischemia further compromises LV performance, and diminishes the LV\u2019s ability to compensate for RV dysfunction [7].",

As the pulmonary artery (PA) pressure gradually increases over time, the RV adapts to the increase in afterload through multiple compensatory mechanisms. Myocyte hypertrophy and the expansion of the extracellular matrix result in increased chamber thickness. At the same time, the RV remodels into a more spherical shape with a smaller radius [8]. Through the application of LaPlace\u2019s law, which states that wall stress is proportional to chamber radius and inversely proportional to chamber thickness, it is evident that the primary result of these initial adaptations is to reduce wall stress, countering the effect of the rise in afterload. In addition, central venous pressure (CVP) is allowed to rise, taking advantage of the Frank-Starling mechanism to maintain a normal stroke volume.",

This supply-demand mismatch further compromises RV performance and ultimately leads to RV failure if the PH remains untreated.

States of chronic volume overload, such as an atrial septal defect, can persist for decades prior to the development of RV dysfunction. Two consequences of persistent RV dilatation are distortion of the tricuspid annulus and septal shift. The dilated tricuspid annulus permits tricuspid regurgitation, which can further exacerbate the volume load on the RV. Septal shift occurs when the pericardium is unable to distend any further to accommodate the dilation of the RV. As noted above, septal shift can subsequently impair LV filling and adversely affect LV performance. Finally, prolonged volume overload may cause PA pressures to rise due to increased flow through the pulmonary circuit. The development of PH is often the trigger for decompensation of the chronic volume overloaded state, as the dilated RV lacks the compensatory mechanisms to augment its contractility in the setting of increased afterload [10].",

It may present with focal RV dysfunction at the sites of involvement, and may ultimately progress to RV dilatation and global RV dysfunction. The typical clinical presentation is ventricular arrhythmias, with symptoms of RV failure affecting less than 10 % of ARVC patients [11]. In most patients, RV dysfunction can be present for decades without significant symptomatology. A similar observation has been made in animal experiments, in which an isolated reduction in RV contractility does not impair cardiac output in the setting of a normal PVR. In these animals, central filling pressures rise to permit sufficient flow through the pulmonary circuit. However, when PVR is raised, there is rapid cardiac decompensation, suggesting that the progression of RV dysfunction to RV failure may require the presence of an additional stressor, such as PH [12]. The Fontan operation, in which a passive conduit is created between systemic venous return and the pulmonary arteries, takes advantage of this physiology to maintain adequate flow to the LV despite the absence of RV contractility.",

Qualitatively comparing RV size to LV size in the apical view can provide a reasonable assessment of RV dilatation. Additional anatomic information that can be easily obtained is the appearance of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, and the presence of valvular stenosis or regurgitation. Doppler evaluation of the tricuspid regurgitant jet allows the estimation of the systolic pulmonary artery pressure through the use of the modified Bernoulli equation. Important information is also provided by the appearance of the interventricular septum in the short-axis views. Pressure overload states cause flattening of the septum, particularly during systole, which volume overload states cause flattening during diastole (Fig. 4.5). With increasing pressure or volume overload, the septum is further shifted into the LV, leading to the hemodynamic effects of ventricular interdependence discussed previously.\n",

While left heart disease is often manifested on imaging studies by a reduced LV ejection fraction or mitral valve disease, RHC can identify elevated PCWP in the absence of valvular disease or LV dysfunction (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). Distinguishing the underlying etiology of PH will direct the choice of therapy, as therapies that have proven benefit in some forms of PH have been shown to be harmful in PH related to left heart disease [15]. Beyond anatomy, RHC provides information about the severity of RV failure. For example, the RAP is typically about 50 % of the PCWP [16]. As RV failure progresses, the RAP will approach or exceed the PCWP. Another sign of worsening RV failure is a decrease in the PA pressure despite a rising RAP due to insufficient power generation by the RV.",

This takes on importance in the assessment of PH due to left heart failure (i.e. patients with a PCWP >15 mmHg). When the PCWP is elevated, but the TPG is less than 10\u201312 mmHg, PH is termed \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cpost-capillary\u201d, indicating that the elevation in PA pressures can be solely attributed to the elevated left-sided filling pressures. When the TPG is greater than 15 mmHg, the PH is termed \u201cmixed\u201d indicating that there is both a pre-capillary and post-capillary component of the PH. This may be secondary to vasoconstriction and pulmonary arterial remodeling as a response to chronically increased pulmonary venous pressures. Mixed PH can be further stratified into \u201creactive\u201d and \u201cnonreactive\u201d forms through administration of a vasodilator, such as sodium nitroprusside or milrinone, to reduce the PCWP. In non-reactive PH, the TPG will remain elevated despite a lower PCWP, whereas patients with reactive PH will have concurrent decreases in the PCWP and TPG. The presence of reactive PH may indicate a more favorable prognosis, particularly when considering a patient for advanced therapies such as cardiac transplantation [17]. Whether patients with either reactive PH or nonreactive PH will benefit from selective pulmonary vasodilators is a subject of ongoing investigation.",

In each of these entities, RV failure is the culmination of chronic pathophysiological disturbances, and often marks the transition to an advanced disease state. Numerous investigations have connected markers of RV dysfunction to adverse outcomes (Table 4.3). In chronic HF with LV dysfunction, RVEF, as measured by radionuclide ventriculography, invasive hemodynamics or CMRI, has been correlated with exercise capacity [21, 22], ventilatory efficiency [23], and survival [24\u201329]. This association has been demonstrated in both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies [24, 25, 29]. Importantly, there appears to be an additive effect of PH and RV dysfunction, leading to worse outcomes than the presence of either PH or RV dysfunction alone (Fig. 4.6) [30]. Other imaging parameters that have been associated with outcomes in chronic HF include CMRI-derived RV volumes [31], TAPSE [32\u201334] and RIMP [35]. Similar findings have been demonstrated in RV dysfunction due to PAH [36\u201340] and congenital heart disease [41, 42].\n\n",

            "text": "In acute RV failure, inotropes are often required to support the RV until the etiology can be treated. Milrinone may be the preferred agent due to its vasodilatory properties in the pulmonary vasculature, but its use is limited in patients with significant hypotension. Dobutamine and dopamine are more likely to cause tachycardia, which may exacerbate ischemia in the setting of an RVI. In some cases of RVI, mechanical support with an intraaortic balloon pump or a temporary right ventricular assist device (RVAD) has been used, although neither of these approaches has been well studied. Temporary RVADs have also been used to treat RV failure that occurs following cardiovascular surgery or cardiac transplantation.",

            "text": "For chronic RV failure, choices for augmenting contractility are limited. Digoxin is often used as an inotrope in the management of RV failure, based on its short-term hemodynamic benefits in patients with PAH [51]. The use of intravenous inotropes for chronic left heart failure has been associated with worse outcomes. Intravenous inotropes may be used for management of exacerbations of chronic RV failure, but the chronic administration of these agents has been associated with worse outcomes. When biventricular heart failure is refractory, a RVAD may be placed in conjunction with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a means of bridging a patient to transplantation. The devices that are approved for RV support are extracorporeal (i.e. non-implantable) and are not meant for long-term support, although the development of more durable RVADs is ongoing. In some cases, these devices can be explanted once stable LVAD support has been established. Cardiac transplantation is a definitive treatment for patients with advanced RV failure that is associated with LV failure, but this therapy is limited in use due to a shortage of donor organs. Cardiac transplantation should not be attempted in patients with high PVR (>6 Woods Units) due to high risk for RV failure and graft loss postoperatively.",

RV failure is the end result of a series of pathophysiological adaptations that are distinct from the pathogenesis of LV failure. A detailed understanding of the RV\u2019s response to specific disease states informs the clinical management of those diseases. Imaging plays a critical role in the assessment of RV dysfunction, and can provide information about the severity of RV failure. Hemodynamic assessment with cardiac catheterization complements the findings from imaging, directing the appropriate therapeutic approach. The treatment of RV failure due is highly dependent on the underlying etiology. Acute causes respond best to removal of the offending pathophysiology. Chronic RV failure requires a targeted approach, as has been applied in the setting of PAH. Research continues into the optimal treatment strategy for PH that is secondary to left heart failure.",
