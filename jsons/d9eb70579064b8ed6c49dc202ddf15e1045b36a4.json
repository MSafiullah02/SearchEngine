The child had been living in a disabled patient center for two months before hospitalization. On 1 January, she was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of Poitiers University Hospital Center for severe pneumonia and otitis due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). She was discharged a week later with anti-biotherapy. Nine days later, she developed fever and diarrhea. Despite symptomatic treatment, she was referred to the pediatric intensive care unit on 20 January for septic shock with acute pneumonia and diarrhea. On admission, she appeared hypotrophic (weight: 13,000 g), cyanotic and lethargic, with neurologic hypotonic signs. Physical examination showed high fever, important signs of acute respiratory infection, major hypotension (mean arterial pressure: 25 torr), tachycardia, hepatomegaly, and massive diarrhea. Chest X-ray showed bilateral reticulomicronodulary in\u00aeltrates in the upper and lower lung lobes, with pleural effusion.",

The main question arising is the reason why this patient was particularly vulnerable to disseminated adenovirus infection. The presence of an immunode\u00aeciency is the major hypothesis although immunode\u00aeciency is not recognized as part of the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. Ostergaard et al. [1992] showed a defective monocyte oxidative metabolism in a child with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome suffering from repeated febrile infections, but monocyte functions including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and IL-1 production were normal. However, other unknown immune mechanisms might lead to a fatal evolution. Viral infections induce a temporary suppression of Tcell-mediated immunity, or impair respiratory tissue and may increase the risk of developing severe secondary infections, mainly by adenovirus [Munoz et al., 1998 ]. In our patient, RSV detected at \u00aerst admission might have contributed to the severity of adenovirus serotype 7 subsequent infection.",
