The stability of 3CLpro is dramatically increased by mutating the Arg at the 188 position to Ile. The enzymatic efficiency of the R188I mutant was increased by a factor of more than 1 \u00d7 106. The potency of the mutant protease makes it possible to quantitatively evaluate substrate-based peptide-mimetic inhibitors easily by conventional HPLC using a substrate peptide containing no fluorescence derivatives. The evaluations revealed that a peptide aldehyde covering the P-site sequence of substrate, Ac-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-NHCH(CH2CH2CON(CH3)2)\u2013CHO, inhibits the SARS 3CLpro with an IC50 value of 37 \u03bcM. Systematic modification guided by the X-ray crystal structure of a series of peptide-mimics in a complex with R188I SARS 3CLpro resulted in 1 with an IC50 value of 98 nM (Fig. 1\n).13 All of the side-chain structures of 1 differed from the substrate sequence except at the P3 site, where the side-chain was directed outward. Kinetic inhibition data for 1 obtained from Lineweaver\u2013Burk plots suggested that inhibitors containing an aldehyde at the C-terminus can be expected to function as competitive inhibitors.",

Among the key interactions clarified by X-ray crystallographic study, we focused on hydrophobic interactions at the cyclohexyl side-chain to design a novel inhibitor scaffold. Thus, the cyclohexyl ring is connected to the main-chain at an \u03b1-nitrogen atom of the P2 position Cha (cyclohexylalanine) via a methylene linker to yield compound 2 (Fig. 1). The resulting decahydroisoquinolin scaffold of 2 is expected to keep the hydrophobic interactions at the cyclohexyl ring of the substrate-based inhibitor at the S2 pocket. In addition, the resulting decahydroisoquinolin scaffold arranges the P1 site imidazole and active site functional aldehyde at each required position, giving the fused-ring structure of decahydroisoquinolin as a scaffold for a novel inhibitor. The acyl substituent on the nitrogen in the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold may add an extra position for the interactions with the 3CLpro.",

The known ester 6 was first reacted with butadiene to construct the six-membered ring structure to yield 7 as an enantiomer mixture of 1,6-trans-substituted cyclohexene. The product was reduced with LAH and the resulting alcohol was then protected as tert-butyldiphenylsilyl ether to give 8. The benzyl group was removed by catalytic hydrogenation, which reduced the cyclohexene to cyclohexane at the same time. The resulting hydroxyl group was then oxidized with PCC and the resulting aldehyde was then reacted with (EtO)2P(O)CH2COOEt to yield 9. The ethyl ester of 9 was reduced with DIBALH and the resulting alcohol was protected as acetyl ester to give 10. After treatment with TBAF, the resulting alcohol was converted to the azide derivative 11 by a Mitsunobu reaction. Since the product 11 was rather unstable, 11 was immediately reduced to the corresponding amine. Without further purification, the amine derivative was coupled with p-phenylbenzoic acid using HBTU to yield 12 as an enantiomer mixture. Coupling with p-bromobenzoic acid was similarly conducted to yield a related derivative 13.",

The product was an enantiomer mixture which was thought to have the relative configuration of 14/15 due to the cyclization through a less hindered Pd-chelated intermediate. Thus, the vinyl substituent of the product 14/15 was thought to be axial, which was clearly confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies of the inhibitor in a complex with the R188I mutant SARS 3CLpro as discussed below. The olefin bond of 14/15 was oxidatively cleaved by the treatment with K2OsO2(OH)4 followed by NaIO4 to yield aldehyde 16/17. Reductive amination by H-His(Trt)-N(OCH3)CH3 gave the coupling products 18 and 20 or 19 and 21 as a 1:1 diastereomer mixture which was separable on a reversed-phase column (YMC Pack ODS) by analytical HPLC (Fig. S1). The diastereomers could also be separated by conventional silica-gel column chromatography to yield diastereomers 18 and 20 or 19 and 21, each having single peak on the above reversed-phase column. Each separated diastereomer was then treated with TFA to cleave the Trt group at the imidazole ring, and the product was reduced with DIBALH to yield the desired aldehyde 22/23 or 24/25. Although the absolute configuration of each product was not determined at this stage, the purity of each product was confirmed by analytical HPLC. Since moderate but clear inhibitory activities were observed in a preliminary evaluation on the inhibitory potency of 22 and 24, the identification of the stereo-structure was then conducted.",

As summarized in Table 1, synthesized decahydroisoquinolin derivatives all showed inhibitory activities for the mutant 3CLpro. The results strongly suggest that the decahydroisoquinolin fused-ring can function as an inhibitor scaffold. Comparison of IC50 values of trans-decahydroisoquinolin diastereomers in N-4-phenylbenzoyl derivatives (40 vs 44) or N-4-bromobenzoyl derivative (41 vs 45) clearly showed that the (4aR,8aS) isomer is more potent than (4aS,8aR) isomer. The results suggest the importance of the interaction at the S2 pocket of the mutant 3CLpro. It was also demonstrated that a series of the N-benzoyl derivative was more potent than N-4-phenylbenzoyl derivatives. Substitution at the 4-position of the benzoyl substituent in 48 with halogen showed no significant effect on the inhibitory activity (41 and 49), whereas substitution at the 4-position of the phenyl group in the N-biphenylacyl derivative 40 gave a slightly more potent inhibitor than 2- or 3-substituted biphenyl derivatives (46 and 47).

In both inhibitors, the P1 site imidazole ring and the terminal aldehyde group had nearly the same interactions as in the (4aR,8aS)-N-bromobenzoyl decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor 41 described above.

This conformation change of the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold transferred to the direction of the N-substituent.
