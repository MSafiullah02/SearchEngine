Among these 48 cases, there was an interesting case in which the patient presented with a skin rash with petechiae. Because dengue is very common in our setting, petechiae rash is a common clinical finding in dengue, and the patient also had low platelet count, a clinical diagnosis of dengue was made by the first physician in charge. There was no photograph and a biopsy was not done because biopsy is not a routine practice according to dengue clinical practice guidelines in our tropical setting. The patient was initially misdiagnosed as dengue, which resulted in a delayed diagnosis.3\n",
