In general, the indication for surgery is set by clinical and radiological diagnosis. The diagnostic work-up for patients with multiple trauma has undergone a paradigm shift from the conventional approach (ultrasound and conventional radiography) to whole-body CT as the first diagnostic tool used in trauma centres [2\u20137]. For this purpose, a CT scanner is located directly in or nearby the resuscitation area of the emergency room or trauma suite. This has resulted in faster diagnostics and treatment intervals [8\u201310]. CT is widely accepted as the gold-standard early diagnostic tool in patients with multiple injuries. If performed quickly, it is feasible even in haemodynamically unstable and severely injured patients [11]. The direct effect of this approach on the mortality and morbidity of trauma patients is still controversial and fiercely debated [12\u201314].",

This quality improvement process is currently in progress and will be finished after a couple of measures and consequences. The results of this process will be reported separately. Bearing in mind that we found reduction in tOR despite the limitations of working within a new environment and with new technology and workflows we assume, that with training, experience and adaptation to the growing dimension and complexity a better performance can be achieved within a few months.
