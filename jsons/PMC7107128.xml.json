Incharoen and Maneechote (2013) showed that dietary insoluble fiber (IF) such as whole rice hulls (WRH) at 60 g/kg diet can be used to enhance growth and uniformity of pullets and improve egg production of laying hens. The inclusion in the diet of IF from oat hulls, at levels between 2 to 3% improves the growth performance of broilers fed low-fiber diets (Mateos et al., 2012) and dietary inclusion of 3% inulin or cellulose (Arbocel FD00) as an IF source has been shown to reduce feed intake and improved egg production of broiler breeder hens from 43 to 55 wk of age (Mohiti-Asli et al., 2012).",

Transit time (retention time) of ingested food from the crop to the gizzard and gizzard activity can be increased by IF and these physiological effects can improve mixing of feed particles with digestive secretions and hence improve digestion and absorption of nutrients (Mateos et al., 2012).",

Adding IF in the form of oat hulls and wood shavings to broiler and layer diets has been shown to benefit nutrient digestion (Hetland et al., 2003, 2005) possibly as a result of an increased amylase concentration in the chyme of the jejunum (Hetland et al., 2003). The majority of experiments examining the effects of IF on the functioning of digestive enzymes have examined the effects on pancreatic or intestinal lipases, amylases and peptidases (Hetland et al., 2003; Taylor and Jones, 2004; Sarikhan et al., 2009; Svihus, 2011). There has been very little systematic work on the effects of IF on proteolytic enzymes of the different supply organs of the digestive tract (proventriculus, pancreas and small intestine) of layer-strain poultry. Enhanced activity of such enzymes may improve the supply of amino acids for body and reproductive organ growth, which continue after supply organs have developed, and may thus contribute to improve egg production.",

In adult poultry, two pepsinogens have been detected, pepsinogen A (cPgA) and pepsinogen C (cPgC).

Inc., Rosenberg, Germany) in the diets of young layer-strain pullets between the ages of 8 and 18 wk influenced supply organ growth and proteolytic enzyme activities in the proventriculus, pancreas, and small intestine. In addition, the experiment was designed to determine whether there was a residual effect of IF on the supply organs and enzyme activities 5 wk after it was removed from the diet. The effect of starting the IF feed at a later age, 13 wk, was also determined. Concentration of pepsin in proventricular tissue can be affected by hormones such as neurotensin and food in the gut (Degolier et al., 1997). On the other hand, pepsinogen mRNA activity is unlikely to be affected by short-term effects on pepsinogen secretion from oxyntic cells. We therefore wished to determine whether there was a correlation between pepsin activity and mRNA in proventricular tissue so as to provide an alternate means of measuring the effects of dietary changes on digestive function.",

In Experiment 2, the BW of hens in Group IF were also not significantly different from control hens (Table 3). The inclusion of IF in the diets had no detrimental effect on BW of the pullets or laying hens as, in all treatments in Experiment 1 (Table 2), mean BW was heavier than the normal ranges for Hy-line Brown pullets and in Experiment 2 the BW of both treatment groups (Table 3) was within the normal ranges (Hy-Line International, 2014). Others have shown that IF can improve BW gain in both layer-strain and broiler birds, and it is possible that weight gain may be affected by age or developmental age at which IF is given or by the strain of poultry used. Incharoen and Maneechote (2013) showed that IF supplied as whole rice hulls to younger pullets and of a different strain than used here, 4- to 8-week-old HN Nick Brown layer-strain pullets, resulted in a significant increase in BW. Gonz\u00e1lez-Alvarado et al.

            "text": "Insoluble fiber has been shown to affect the weights of supply organs and can affect functioning of the GIT, digestibility of feed and feed conversion of poultry (e.g., Hetland et al., 2004, 2005; Mateos et al., 2012). Addition of pea fiber, wheat bran and oat bran either at low (18 g/kg) or high levels (375 g/kg) in broiler diets was shown by J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1996) to cause a significant increase in the weight of the GIT tract which is similar to the results of Experiment 1 in pullets given the IF diet for 10 wk. The effects of IF on gizzard and proventricular weights shown here are similar to those in an experiment by Gonz\u00e1lez-Alvarado et al. (2007), in which IF was included in the diets of broiler chicks from 1 to 21 d of age: the IF was included either as 3% oat hulls or 3% soy hulls, in low-fiber diets (crude fiber 2.5%). Oat hulls caused a significant increase in gizzard weight: proventricular weight was only significantly increased with soy hulls (Gonz\u00e1lez-Alvarado et al., 2007). Thus source of IF (and therefore proportions of the different fiber components) can influence organ development differently. Similar to the experiment reported here using Arbocel RC, Bogus\u0142awska-Tryk (2005) also reported no effect of the IF source, Arbocel BWW-40, on pancreas weight. Adding IF to poultry feeds has been shown to change the weight and length of the GIT (Siri, 1992; Viveros et al., 1994; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 1996; Smits et al., 1997) which supports the results obtained in Experiment 1. Taylor and Jones (2004) suggested that increased gizzard size could be a reason for the reduction in weight of the small intestine they found and may reflect an adaptation of the gut to increased availability of nutrients as a result of feeding a diet containing increased fiber concentration. A well-developed gizzard can positively enhance digestion as food is retained for a longer time in the upper digestive tract (proventriculus and gizzard) and this may activate digestive secretions from specific organs and result in more efficient nutrient assimilation (Jones and Taylor, 2001). Gonz\u00e1lez-Alvarado et al. (2007) showed that fiber improved total tract apparent retention of feed and feed conversion and it also caused a decrease in the pH in the gizzard. Fewer experiments using IF have been carried out on layer-strain poultry than broilers; however, Freitas et al. (2014) showed that 7 wk old Hy-Line Brown pullets given increased dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) for 5 wk had significantly increased liver and intestinal weights but gizzard weight, unlike that in Experiment 1, was reduced.",

After 10 wk on those diets (Table 4), activities of pepsin, pancreatic GP, trypsin and chymotrypsin were significantly higher in Group IF than Group C pullets.

            "text": "The significantly greater mRNA expression of pepsinogens A and C in the pullets given IF reflects the higher pepsin activities determined in proventricular homogenates and probably reflects an increase in production of the zymogens of pepsin enzymes. The similarity in increase between mRNA of pepsinogen A and that of pepsinogen C suggests that the mechanism of stimulation of the two zymogens was similar and could have been caused by physical effects on the oxyntic (or oxynticopeptic) cells of the proventriculus or by one or more of the following that have been shown to influence pepsinogen production: increased production of cholecystokinin (CCK), decreased pH in the proventriculus and increased reflux of bile from the small intestine via the gizzard (Sommer and Kasper, 1981; Duke, 1982; Li and Owyang, 1993; Sacranie et al., 2005; Jim\u00e9nez-Moreno et al., 2009; Svihus, 2011; Sacranie et al., 2012). Pepsin activity is stimulated by low pH and possibly through an increase in solubility of mineral salts (Incharoen and Maneechote, 2013) and others have reported on the decrease in proventricular and gizzard pH caused by IF (e.g., Hetland et al., 2003; Svihus, 2011).",

Regulation of the production of pancreatic enzymes is through hormones such as CCK, secretin and gastrin produced in the digestive tract (Sommer and Kasper, 1981; Li and Owyang, 1993; Owyang and Logsdon, 2004; Wang and Cui, 2007). Hormone production in the intestinal mucosa of pullets fed IF could have been increased through increased intestinal tissue production (Table 2), and this in turn could lead to increased production of zymogens of the pancreatic enzymes and thus to measurement of an increased activity of the enzymes. Significant increases in pancreatic GP and chymotrypsin activities were seen in both experiments reported here when IF was added to diets of layer-strain pullets or hens but trypsin activity was only significantly increased in pullets in Experiment 1. These different responses could have been due to the stage of maturity of the birds or to the differences in fiber concentration of the diets fed to the poultry in the two different experiments.",
