The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread, but variable, airflow obstruction with the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment 1. The asthma nomenclature as well as the definition of disease severity and management goals has changed substantially in recent years. It has moved away from a system predominantly based on lung function and symptoms towards one based on therapeutic methods and doses required to achieve disease control.",

Over 100 mediators have been identified to be involved, among those are:Chemokines which recruit inflammatory cells like eosinophils or Th2 cells from the blood vessels into the airways. Examples are eotaxin, thymus and activation\u2010regulated chemokines (TARC) or macrophage\u2010derived chemokines (MDC) 9.Cysteinyl leukotrienes which are potent bronchoconstrictors and having proinflammtory potency. They derive from mast cells and eosinophils 10.Cytokines orchestrate the inflammatory response. Interleukins (IL) like IL\u20101\u00df or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u2010\u03b1) amplify the inflammation, whereas granulocyte macrophage \u2013 colony stimulation factor (GM\u2010CSF) prolongs eosinophil survival. IL\u20105 mediates eosinophil differentiation and survival, and IL\u20104 is important for Th2 cell differentiation. IL\u201013 is required for IgE (immunoglobulin E) formation 11.Histamine is released from mast cells, and it has various pro\u2010inflammatory functions leading, among others, to vasodilatation or to bronchoconstriction 12.Nitric oxide (NO) functions as a vasodilator. Allergic inflammation in the airways activates the inducible NO synthase in bronchoepithelial cells causing higher NO levels e.g. in asthmatic patients 13, 14, 15.Prostaglandin D2 is a potent bronchoconstrictor released from mast cells which has chemotactic properties on Th2 cells 16.\n",

Remodeling can be seen as an adaption to injury and mechanical demands by changing geometry, structure and properties within the airway wall. Patients with poorly controlled asthma develop progressive persistent airflow limitation with longer disease durations and insufficient or no anti\u2010inflammatory therapy providing evidence that airway remodeling plays a crucial role in the impairment of lung function 17, 18, 19, 20. It occurs in a wide range of tissues and organs and can be observed in almost all tissues susceptible to repeated chronic injury. In the asthmatic inflammation, it leads to structural changes of the airway which includes changes of the epithelium, subepithelial fibrosis, increased airway smooth muscle mass with hyperplasic and hypertrophic composition, decreased distance between the smooth muscles and the epithelium, thickening of the reticular basement membrane, dysregulated extracellular matrix, mucous gland and goblet cell hyperplasia, vascular changes and oedema 21, 22, 23, 24. Some of these changes are related to the severity of the disease and may result in relatively irreversible narrowing of the airways or are related to airway hyperresponsiveness. The thickness of the reticular basement membrane has been correlated to airflow obstruction and increased airway hyperresponsiveness 25, 26, 27.",

Th\u20102 type cells dominate over Th\u20101 type cells promote subepithelial fibrosis and hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle cells 28.Regulatory T\u2010cells exhibit cytokine\u2010dependent suppressive mechanism via IL\u201010 and TGF\u2010\u00df secretion. They induce via \u2013 among others \u2013 the transcription of IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) which leads to subendothelial fibrosis, collagen deposition and increased accumulation of actin\u2010containing smooth muscle cells 29.Regulated by proinflammatory chemokines such as RANTES (regulation on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), IL\u20105 and eotaxin, eosinophils accumulate in the airways of asthmatics. They produce many proinflammatory and remodeling cytokines including IL\u20106, IL\u201011 or IL\u201017 3, 30, 31.Airway epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells form a trophic unit. Epithelial damage occurs typically as a response to the environmental exposure, results in production of signals that act on the underlying mesenchyme to propagate and amplify inflammatory and remodeling responses in the submucosa. Allergen sensitisation may be the consequence of a defective airway epithelium leading to an activation of dendritic cells towards promoting a Th2 response. Activated epithelial cells produce, via STAT\u20106 activation (e.g. by infiltrating T lymphocytes), numerous chemokines including IL\u20108, RANTES and eotaxin. Further, they release growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet\u2010derived growth factor (PDGF), TGF\u2010\u00df and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). All of these advocate airway smooth muscle proliferation, angiogenesis and ECM protein deposition.The airway smooth muscle cells are the most important effort cells of the whole inflammatory process. Evidence of either hypertrophy, hyperplasia, or both is reported in mild, moderate and severe asthma, and it is correlated with the severity of the disease. Myocytes proliferate in response to growth factors and inflammatory mediators. They can also increase in size and shape and migrate. Airway smooth muscle cells not only respond to inflammatory processes, they themselves participate in the remodeling process through their release of cytokines like TGF\u2010\u00df, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u00df, IL\u20108, Interferon\u2010gamma (IFN\u2010\u03b3), chemokines like RANTES, eotaxin, MIP\u20101\u03b1 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha) and ECM proteins 2, 32, 33, 34, 35. Many of those cytokines induce the expression of toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) on airway smooth muscle cells. Gram\u2010negative bacteria were suggested to promote airway hyperresponsiveness through TLRs on those cells. Infections in general or viral/bacterial components activate TLRs and thus contribute to remodeling 36, 37, 38.Fibroblasts differentiate in response to various stimuli into myofibroblasts which secrete, among other inflammatory mediators, ECM proteins 39, 40. In severe asthma, or insufficiently with anti\u2010inflammatory drug\u2010treated asthma, subepithelial fibrosis occurs because of increases deposition of ECM proteins, including collagens I, III, V, proteoglycan, tenascin and fibronectin. The deposition of ECM proteins are regulated by myofibroblasts and the imbalance between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP\u20109), which degrades collagen 4 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP\u20101) being both secreted by fibroblasts 41.Mucus glands are activated in asthma. Increase mucus hypersecretion because of goblet cell proliferation is a common feature in poorly controlled asthma. Predominantly IL\u20101\u00df, IL\u20109, IL\u201013, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and COX\u20102 and their associated intracellular signalling pathways have been shown to be involved in the upregulation of mucin synthesis further promoting goblet cell hyperplasia. However, goblet cell hyperplasia is not a general feature in asthma and only found in a subgroup of patients 42.\n",

This explains the susceptibility of asthmatic airways to respiratory germs and the impact on the health of poorly controlled asthmatic patients 44, 45. Furthermore, inhaled (virus, bacteria) and even ingested germs (e.g. parasites) interact with the immune system which may enhance or restrain the immunogenic response utilising the same inflammatory pathways as described above 46, 47, 48. Infections in early life are linked with subsequent respiratory morbidity, but they were also protective towards the eventual development of allergic diseases and possible asthma as proposed by the hygiene hypothesis 49, 50.

Natural and experimental viral infection induces activation of transcription factors like NF\u2010\u03baB. This initiate gene transcription of cytokine and chemokine production such as IL\u20101\u00df, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201011, membrane cofactor protein 1, MIP\u20101\u03b1 and RANTES 28, 54, 55, 56. These mediators promote tissue infiltration by T cells, eosinophils and basophils. When activated they themselves, release mediators such as eosinophil cationic protein, histamine and with the immunological reaction also virus\u2010specific IgE. The persistence and severity of the inflammation seem to be more pronounced in atopic asthma compared to healthy individuals which is because of an immunological imbalance in Th1\u2010 and Th2\u2010type cytokines released during the inflammation.",

Rhinovirus is probably the most important pathogen in triggering asthma attacks. RSV and HRV turned out in epidemiologic studies to be the most often detected viruses depending on season and geographic areas 68, 69. HRV infections peak with asthma hospitalisations in spring and autumn, while RSV is more likely to trigger acute asthma symptoms in the winter time 70, 71. Although there is clear evidence that virus infection is a trigger for asthma exacerbations, there is no clear evidence that asthma patients have more colds than healthy individuals. But asthmatics may suffer from extended duration of illness and increased severity of lower respiratory tract symptoms. This finding suggest that the response to a viral infection but not the frequency differ between susceptible and healthy patients 72, 73. Atopy promotes more severe illnesses than non\u2010allergic asthma after infection with respiratory viruses 71. Delayed viral clearance and increased viral load in the upper respiratory tract are obviously not the reasons for that phenomenon. Authors suggested an abnormal antiviral activity e.g. by reduced generation of interferons to virus infections as a possible reason for increased susceptibility 73 or disruption of the innate immune host defence pathways through the antagonistic interaction between allergic inflammation and antiviral immunity 74.",

Geographical and temporal variations in the natural history of these infections seem also to play a role. Commonly used methods like serological detection of IgG antibodies cannot distinguish between previous infection, chronic colonisation and reactivation of a chronic infection, while the prevalence of IgG antibodies against atypical bacteria is high among the general population, allowing no comparison between asthmatic patients and control group 90.

The most predominant correlation between immune system activation and structural changes of the airways is mediated through MMPs. MMPs and their physiological inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of TIMPs, are produced by different structural and inflammatory cells mainly by smooth muscle cells of submucosa and stimulated macrophages recruited in the lung. The proteolytic\u2013antiproteolytic activity of these proteins is regulated by several cytokines and thought to be significant for various physiological processes like healing and development. In the contrary, the dysfunction of this proteolytic system provoked by deregulation of their expression or change of their biological activity is involved in a wide range of lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis, lung cancer and asthma 96, 97.",

Helicobacter pylori for example is one of the non\u2010respiratory pathogens assumed to have, except of its local complications, systemic immunomodulatory effects that may prevent the development of asthma 111, 112. An inverse prevalence between H. pylori infection and asthma is consistently confirmed in many different populations and geographical areas. It still remains unclear if this is an etiological association or an observation triggered by other lifestyle trends or even an incidentally occurred phenomenon 113. Up to now, eradication therapy is no recommended treatment strategy for asthma, as prospective studies are lacking in this field and much more research is required.",

These interactions lead (i) to the activation of tolerogenic dendritic cells, and through these (ii) to a balanced Th1/Th2 differentiation important for the lifetime maintenance of immune tolerance of the host. If the establishment of intestinal microbiota is disrupted by early\u2010life events like antibiotic use, the tolerogenic immunomodulatory effects are minimised, resulting in overproduction of Th2 cytokines which is a risk factor for autoimmune and allergic diseases 114. Interventional methods with potentially probiotics (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains) aiming to create healthy microflora have been intensively tested as treatment or prevention in many allergic diseases like atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and asthma, but so far available studies provide contradictory results, and the generalisation of a positive effect in all allergic conditions should be carefully considered 115, 116.",

It was also found that neonates colonised in hypopharyngeal region are under increased risk for recurrent wheeze and asthma within the first 5 years of life 120. Particularly evident is the association of these pathogens with a subset of stable asthma, known as neutrophilic asthma, where inflammation is primarily mediated by neutrophils and less by eosinophils. H. influenzae was isolated from the airways of neutrophilic people with asthma, and infection\u2010induced inflammation was mediated by IL\u201017 expression 121.",

Macrolides, except of their obvious antimicrobial properties, are shown to exert anti\u2010inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity by suppressing the production of cytokines in inflamed tissue 124, 125. They have been reported to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness, improve pulmonary function and sometimes soften the symptoms, but it still remains a matter of debate if this is an antimicrobial effect resulting to the limitation of the bacterial load or just an anti\u2010inflammatory action of the macrolide, or both as the reduction of bacteria is subsequently followed by decreased cytokine expression 126. Much additional research is required to define the right agents for the right patient, the optimum dosage and duration of therapy and the adequate treatment until macrolide treatment can be recommended as a long\u2010term treatment option for asthma patients 127.",

However, a meta\u2010analysis of epidemiologic studies did not confirm this general conclusion, as only infection with hookworm was found to be protective, while Ascaris lumbricoides was associated with increased risk of asthma, and no significant effect was found with other species. Trichuris trichiura in early life are associated with less positive prick tests in childhood, while Toxocara infection increases the risk of wheeze in some populations 47. Apparently, the positive or negative effect of helminths in allergy and asthma differ between different species, and it is now suggested that many more factors can also be causative for this interaction as the chronicity, the timing and the parasitic burden of the disease 113, 131.",

Remodeling processes in paediatric population raises further questions about the meaning of chronic inflammation and the genetic susceptibility that needs to be explored. This area is certainly challenging in regard to the development of new therapeutic compounds aiming at the inhibition of specific inflammatory pathways including those triggered by viruses and bacteria. Finally, identification of biomarkers identifying remodeling is essential to study these processes in detail: (i) to identify patients being particularly at risk to develop those irreversible changes, and (ii) to clarify the effect of anti\u2010inflammatory treatment regimes.",
