This is in addition to 1 mask for the patient. In the ED, we estimate a minimum of 1152 masks, 960 gowns and pairs of gloves would be consumed to test 192 patients, whereas drive through",

            "text": "A drive through unit for COVID-19 testing was established on the Mayo Clinic Florida campus for established patients. The drive through operates 6 hours per day, 7 days a week and consists of 3 stations. At station one, patients display their patient identification and mobile phone number on their vehicle dashboard. They are given a handout regarding expectations for result notification as well as the Center for Disease Control COVID-19 prevention and symptom monitoring recommendations.4 At station two, dashboard information is used to confirm the patient meets COVID-19 testing criteria through a triage phone line.5 Patients who meet criteria proceed to station three for nasal swab collection at 1 of 3 pods. Each pod has 2 staff members with full PPE for collection and processing per patient being tested. Each of the 6 staff members requiring full PPE use 1 face shield, 2 masks and 4 gowns per day. Gloves are changed between each patient. An additional 15 staff members direct traffic between stations, with each using 2 masks and 4 glove changes per day.During the first full 7 days of operation, our COVID-19 drive through tested a total of 1153 patients, averaging 192 patients per day. To test 192 patients in the ED, we estimate at least 5 sets of PPE would be consumed per patient. This includes PPE for medical personnel rooming the patient, assigned registered nurse, ED provider, registration, and cleaning staff.",
