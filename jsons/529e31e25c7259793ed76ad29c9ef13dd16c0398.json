In particular, rapid molecular methods for nucleic acid ampli fi cation and characterization combined with automation and userfriendly software have signi fi cantly broadened the diagnostic capabilities of modern clinical microbiology laboratories. Molecular methods such as nucleic acid ampli fi cation tests (NAATs) rapidly are being developed and introduced in the clinical laboratory setting. Indeed, every section of the clinical microbiology laboratory, including bacteriology, mycology, mycobacteriology, parasitology, and virology, have bene fi ted from these advanced techniques. Because of the rapid development and adaptation of these molecular techniques, the interpretation and relevance of the results produced by such molecular methods has lagged somewhat behind. The purpose of this chapter is to review and discuss the interpretation and relevance of results produced by these advanced molecular techniques. Moreover, this chapter will address the \"myths\" of NAATs, as these myths can markedly in fl uence the interpretation and relevance of these results.",

Most of NAATs possess excellent analytical sensitivity reaching ten copies of target genomes per reaction. This has made the NAATs essential for the detection of microbial pathogens from specimens such as cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) where there may be extremely low microbial loads [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, in certain situations, the sensitivities of NAATs are inferior to conventional culture techniques in which a large volume of a specimen easily can be evaluated. Examples include blood cultures and sputum cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis [7] [8] [9] [10] . Current NAATs are usually performed using very small volumes; until the processing of such specimens is greatly improved, the sensitivity of these NAATs will remain lower than conventional culture techniques.",

Although the use of multiplex PCR ampli fi cation techniques is increasing in the clinical diagnostic fi eld, these multiplex methods account for the minority of molecular testing. In conventional microbial culture techniques, a chocolate agar plate or a mixed cell line would allow the recovery of many different pathogens and/or multiple pathogens if they were present in a tested specimen. From this perspective, the diagnostic sensitivity of a monoplex NAAT may not be suf fi ciently high since it only detects the one pathogen that is being tested for rather than many different pathogens and/or multiple pathogens.",

Real-time PCR methods often incorporate a FRET procedure, which allows the amplicon detection and identi fi cation to occur in real time in relation to the nucleic acid ampli fi cation. This avoids carryover amplicon contamination since the reaction is occurring in closed system. Moreover, real-time PCR allows accurate quanti fi cation of the nucleic acid. However, NAATs based on real-time PCR methods are not necessarily more sensitive than other NAATs [ 11 ] . In contrast, due to the nonspeci fi c spontaneous FRET procedure, real-time PCR assays may be less sensitive due to the raised cutoff values. The arithmetic, spontaneous increase in fl uorescent background emissions interferes with the exponential, speci fi c energy emissions during the simultaneous detection procedure, producing potentially false-positive results. To overcome this nonspeci fi c issue, the system has to either increase the cycle threshold (Ct) cutoff value or decrease the cycle numbers during the ampli fi cation, which results in decreased sensitivity.",

This can be problematic when the microbial load in the tested specimen is extremely low. For example, HSV and Chlamydia pneumoniae detection in CSF specimens by real-time PCR is not as objective and sensitive in comparison to end detection PCR procedures [ 4, 12 ] . In the later procedures, a separate detection and identi fi cation is used after ampli fi cation in which additional signal ampli fi cation (e.g., antigen-antibody linking) can be incorporated to further enhance the test sensitivity [ 12, 13 ] .",

The best example of this is the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in sputum where the dead microbial pathogen DNA can remain un-degraded due to the fatty acid-rich cell walls [ 14, 15 ] . Unlike the results of a function-based testing method, such as mycobacterial cultures, in the clinical setting, a positive PCR result after anti-tuberculosis therapy does not necessarily mean treatment failure. Therefore, DNA-targeted NAATs are usually not considered to be tests of cure. This is also true for sexually transmitted pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea [ 16 ] .",

Treatment may not be modi fi ed until weeks or months later as results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests become available.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is recognized as important for con fi rming susceptibility to chosen empirical antimicrobial agents as well as for detecting resistance in individual microbial isolates [ 34 ] . Current methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing continue to be based for the most part on the detection of microbial growth or lack of growth in the presence of the antimicrobial agent being tested [ 34, 35 ] . The direct detection of resistance genes by molecular methods such as PCR to date has limitations due to the fact that relatively few resistance genes are fi rmly associated with phenotypic resistance [ 34-36 ] . For example, resistance genes associated with phenotypic resistance that can be found in Gram-positive cocci include mecA , vanA , and vanB . In contrast, the lack of consensus sequences among acetyltransferases and adenyltransferase genes from Gram-negative bacilli makes the molecular detection of aminoglycoside resistance dif fi cult. Although molecular methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing are ascending, phenotypic methods for determining the level of susceptibility of bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents are likely to remain clinically relevant for many years.",

This increases the likelihood that sampling a small volume of blood will miss a microorganism that is causing sepsis. Volume-related issues may explain the lower sensitivity seen with a molecular method (66.7 %) than seen with conventional blood cultures in a study of neonatal sepsis [ 31 ] .

In addition, all molecular assays basically include a DNA ampli fi cation step and are categorized by the manner in which the ampli fi ed DNA is detected except for sequencing, which has some distinct advantages over the other methods. None of these methods, including sequencing, are able to detect all resistant strains although sequencing comes the closest to doing so. The major limitation of these molecular methods, except sequencing, is that they detect only known mutations in a de fi ned site or region, as their design is dependent upon known mutations. The advantage of sequencing for molecular detection of mutations of drug resistance can be seen by a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ 45 ] . This study used DNA sequencing to detect resistance to the fi rstline antituberculosis drugs isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol and to the second-line drugs amikacin, capreomycin, kanamycin, cipro fl oxacin, and o fl oxacin. The molecular data were compared to phenotypic data.

In one of these reported cases [ 55 ] , a patient presented with inguinal lymphadenopathy as well as erythema nodosum-like lesions on his legs and forearms. A biopsy of an enlarged inguinal lymph node demonstrated caseating granulomata and numerous acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen staining; a portion of this node was sent for mycobacterial culture and molecular analysis. In addition, a skin biopsy of a forearm nodule was done; this revealed acid-fast bacilli that were morphologically typical of Mycobacterium leprae . A diagnosis of leprosy was made based on the clinical presentation and the skin biopsy results. However, the lymph node sent for mycobacterial culture and molecular analysis was positive by the Gen-Probe Ampli fi ed M. tuberculosis Direct (MTD) test (BBL). Although leprosy was still considered to be a correct diagnosis due to the clinical presentation and the skin biopsy fi ndings, the possibility of this patient also having tuberculosis could not be ruled out until the culture results were known. Therefore, the patient was treated for both leprosy and tuberculosis until cultures at 7 weeks as well as additional PCR testing of lymph node material for M. tuberculosis were reported to be negative. A root cause analysis was done in order to investigate this misidenti fi cation. M. leprae culture material was obtained from the National Hansen's Disease Programs at Louisiana State University; these mycobacterial organisms were tested with the Gen-Probe MTD test and were positive at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 [ 5 ] organisms per ml, but were indeterminate at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 [ 4 ] organisms per ml. The investigators concluded that a high concentration of M. leprae in a clinical specimen could lead to a false-positive result with the Gen-Probe MTD test [ 55 ] .",

            "text": "Despite the obvious clinical importance of respiratory tract infections, the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections has always been problematic due, in large part, to issues related to the optimal collection and evaluation of sputum. The diagnostic value of detecting M. tuberculosis in the sputum was recognized as early as 1884 [ 63 ] , and evaluation of sputum became the cornerstone for the diagnosis of tuberculosis [ 43, 44 ] . Post-mortem studies in the late 1890s and early 1900s then established the role of other microorganisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus in fl uenzae , S. aureus , and Klebsiella pneumoniae in non-tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract [64] [65] [66] . In 1902, the use of the Gram's stain was described [ 67 ] . The microscopic examination of sputum was followed by the introduction of sputum cultures for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia [68] [69] [70] . Of note in these early reports describing sputum cultures was the recognition that collection of the sputum was important. For example, Hastings and Niles in a 1911 publication [ 69 ] point out that, \"Exudates formed in portions of the respiratory tract that are normally sterile may be collected and treated in a way that will prevent contamination.\" These investigators further de fi ne a \" clean sputum , i.e., one containing only two or three types of bacteria and free from buccal squamous cells, and a dirty sputum , i.e., one containing a varied bacterial and fungoid fl ora and buccal squamous cells, are readily recognized on microscopic examination.\" They also state that, \"A dirty sputum is not suitable for bacterial examination and should be discarded for a second or third clean specimen from the same patient.\" Luetscher opines in his paper [ 70 ] that, \"The patient should be instructed to expectorate into the bottle or dish only what he is certain comes from his 'boots,' and also be made to understand that very little is wanted, but that that little must be choice.\" These astute observations remain relevant a century later.",

In the 1960s, these pitfalls were again being articulated and addressed [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . In particular, contamination by microorganisms present in the upper respiratory tract (i.e., nasal-oral-pharyngeal regions) was considered to be a major issue with expectorated sputum [ 77, 78 ] . Because of these pitfalls, a number of alternative methods have been used to obtain better sputum specimens. Bronchoscopy, although introduced early in the twentieth century and used on occasion for aspirating pus from larger airways [ 79 ] , was not widely used for obtaining sputum for microscopy and culture until the 1970s when fi beroptic bronchoscopy became available [ 80 ] . Fiberoptic bronchoscopy also resulted in the use of bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnosing acute bacterial pneumonias [ 81 ] . Other methods adopted for obtaining uncontaminated sputum included transtracheal aspiration [ 72 ] , percutaneous needle biopsy [ 76 ] , and open-lung biopsy [ 71 ] .",

            "text": "Assuming that sputum collection is done correctly, the next issue is making sure that any microbial pathogen present in the sputum can be identi fi ed. It is not surprising that molecular assays for the detection and characterization of microorganisms rapidly emerged in the clinical microbiology laboratory as an important adjunct to traditional culture methods [ 90, 91 ] . It was quickly realized that molecular assays such as NAATs offered signi fi cant advantages over conventional methods for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae [ 92, 93 ] , Legionella species [ 94 ] , and Chlamydia species [ 95 ] ; moreover, these three respiratory pathogens did not require concomitant susceptibility testing results from clinical isolates. Similarly, the advantage of NAATs for the laboratory diagnosis of pertussis was recognized very early [ 96, 97 ] ; PCR testing is now considered by the CDC to be an important tool for diagnosis of pertussis especially in the setting of the current resurgence of pertussis disease as it can provide timely results with improved sensitivity over culture [ 98 ] . The inherent problems associated with the detection and identi fi cation of respiratory viruses by culture and/or serologic methods also resulted in the early application of molecular assays for rapid detection and characterization of respiratory viruses [ 99 ] . Both user-developed and commercial molecular methods have quickly evolved and now allow rapid identi fi cation of multiple common viral pathogens causing respiratory tract infections [100] [101] [102] . In addition to identi fi cation of viral respiratory pathogens, it was appreciated that rapid molecular assays would also offer signi fi cant advantages for diagnosing recognized bacterial pulmonary pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia [ 57, 93, 103, 104 ] . Indeed, initial studies in which rapid molecular assays were combined with conventional diagnostic methods have demonstrated that this approach increased the etiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections considerably [ 105, 106 ] . This was especially true for patients with adequate collection of sputum [ 105 ] . Of interest was the observation that NAATs increased both the diagnostic and treatment costs [ 106 ] . Finally, the diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia is another potential area where the use of rapid molecular assays for respiratory pathogens may prove useful [ 58 ] . Currently clinical trials are needed to provide evidence for which molecular assays are best as well as how this molecular information should be applied in the clinical setting.",

Molecular methods that employ DNA sequencing are often considered completely accurate with 100 % sensitivity and speci fi city. This, unfortunately, is not the case. There are a variety of technical factors such as the in fl uence of contaminating DNA from other sources on the sequencing template, the selection of the primers used for the ampli fi cation, the quality of the base-calling software, and the method used for compiling the \"consensus sequence\" from multiple forward and reverse reactions [ 104, [124] [125] [126] [127] . Inappropriately chosen gene targets and regions will result in false-positives and negatives. The insertion sequence element IS 481 , found in several hundred copies in the Bordetella pertussis genome, is frequently used as a target for B. pertussis detection and has a much greater analytical sensitivity than assays with single-copy target sequences, such as that of the pertussis toxin promoter [ 128 ] . However, false-positive results have been reported due to the smaller copy numbers of IS481 existing in non-pertussis Bordetella species [ 129, 130 ] . The accuracy of assay development is often not appreciated by the non-molecular microbiologist or the clinician.",

In contrast, patients with a diarrheal illness lasting for more than one day, especially when the illness is accompanied by fever, bloody stools, recent antimicrobial use, hospitalization, or systemic illness, should have a microbiologic evaluation of their diarrheal stool [131] [132] [133] [134] . The microbiologic stool evaluation for such enteric infections has for many decades relied upon the analysis of bacterial cultures and/or microscopy to detect ova and parasites [ 134 ] . For nosocomial diarrhea or patients with a history of recent use of antimicrobial agents prior to the onset of diarrhea, the microbiologic stool evaluation should focus on the diagnosis of toxigenic Clostridium dif fi cile [ 135 ] . For persistent diarrhea in patients with a history of international travel, the microbiologic stool evaluation may require special selective and differential agar such as thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose (TSCB) agar for Vibrio species [ 136 ] . Finally, the noroviruses are the most common cause of non-bacterial enteritis worldwide: the laboratory diagnosis of noroviruses depends on the detection of virus particles by EM, detection of viral antigens by EIA, or detection of viral RNA by real-time PCR [ 137 ] .",

Because this specimen is generally a diarrheal stool sample, the extraction step becomes a critical step in this molecular diagnostic process. This is because stool is a complex mixture with multiple and diverse nucleic acids and ampli fi cation inhibitors. Investigators have noted that detection of a given target will be reduced several logs when the target is placed in a stool mixture [ 138 ] . This may result in enteric pathogens present in low numbers being missed. This is the reason that some investigators have used molecular methods following isolation of potential enteric bacterial pathogens from stool [ 149 ] . In addition, extraction of DNA from ova and parasites may be more dif fi cult than extracting DNA from bacteria [ 140 ] . Concentration of ova and parasites that may be present in low numbers may be required, as it is for microscopic evaluation.",

In contrast, FFPE tissue often is the only tissue available when molecular testing is considered as an afterthought. Accordingly, one of the most important limitations in the use of molecular assays for diagnosing tissue infections is considering these assays at the time of biopsy so that fresh tissue can be used or frozen for use later. The difference in sensitivity for PCR testing can be seen by a study in which fresh nonembedded tissues were found to have sensitivities for PCR detection of fungi of 97 % versus only 68 % for FFPE tissue [ 181 ] . The reason for this decreased sensitivity is that nucleic acids obtained from FFPE tissue are frequently damaged (i.e., cross-linked) and may contain PCR inhibitors [ 183, 184 ] . If FFPE tissue must be used, a housekeeping human gene must be ampli fi ed as a control [ 179, 184 ] .",

            "text": "Outcomes from infectious diseases are directly related to the length of time required for identi fi cation of the microbial pathogen. Until recently, clinical microbiology laboratories have been handicapped by conventional, slow multistep culture-based techniques that require prolonged incubation times for many pathogens and are not able to isolate others. Clinicians unable by clinical judgment or diagnostic results to quickly and accurately identify a pathogen causing infection must adopt a conservative approach involving empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Fortunately, this cumbersome approach is rapidly changing because of the introduction of molecular diagnostic techniques. Indeed, molecular assays such as NAATs have initiated a revolution in the fi eld of diagnostic microbiology due to their high sensitivity, speci fi city, rapid test turnaround time as well as potential high throughput and automation. Molecular assays have been heralded as the \"diagnostic tool for the millennium\" [ 189, 190 ] . However, molecular assays also bring some uncertainty such as that caused by false-positive results due to background contamination from exogenous sources of DNA [ 190, 191 ] . For example, one study using a universal 16S rRNA PCR assays detected eubacterial DNA in blood samples from healthy subjects [ 192 ] . NAATs also may give false-negative results due to two principle reasons: (1) the relatively small sample required for PCR reactions and (2) technical problems associated with PCR processing [ 193 ] . Moreover, the results of molecular assays may be dif fi cult to interpret and apply in the clinical setting. As NAATs are increasingly used in routine clinical microbiology laboratories, interpretation is expected to be more dif fi cult as new tests are developed and more complicated multiplex assays emerge. For example, clinical relevance of positive NAATs in paraf fi n block specimens and multiple microbial organisms found in any specimen will need careful interpretation. As the usefulness of these molecular assays is determined by usage over time, communication between the clinician and the microbiology laboratory is always suggested whenever an interpretation is needed. Finally, both the clinical microbiologist and the clinician must acquire a working knowledge of the principles, diagnostic value, and limitations of these molecular assays [ 194, 195 ] . ",
