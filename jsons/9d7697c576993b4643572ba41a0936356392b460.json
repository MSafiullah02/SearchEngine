Phylogenetic analyses can test many hypotheses by comparing diverse isolates collected from various hosts, environments, and points in time and organizing these data into various evolutionary scenarios. The products of a phylogenetic analysis are a graphical tree of ancestor-descendent relationships and an inferred summary of mutations, recombination events, host shifts, geographic, and temporal spread of the viruses. However, this synthesis comes at a price. The cost of computation of phylogenetic analysis expands combinatorially as the number of isolates considered increases. Thus, large datasets like those currently produced are commonly considered intractable.

Phylogenetic tree of four taxa labeled V, W, X, and Y and two hypothetical ancestors labeled P and Q biologists to use shared derived similarities (termed synapomorphies) that distinguish various natural groups of organisms. Nested sets of natural groups of organisms based on synapomorphies are then used to discover the evolutionary relationships between organisms and reconstruct patterns of modification in the features of organisms. Subsequently, these principles have been used to develop optimization techniques to find the most justifiable sets of synapomorphies in large datasets. Optimization techniques are necessary with most large and real world datasets as they often contain several, often conflicting, evolutionary signals (treated below). In contrast, advocates of another way of thinking, termed phenetics [SNE73] , group organisms based on gross measures of similarity. Groups are based on measures evolutionary distance rather than the concept of shared derived characters. In modern practice, similarity methods espousing phenetic concepts are used in searches of nucleotide databases and some multiple alignment methods. Clustering algorithms in which least distant groups are clustered first and then distant clusters are connected are termed distance methods, in phylogenetics. Distance methods typically produce a single tree and cannot, on their own, trace patterns of change in the features of organisms as they convert raw data to distances. Next we discuss how various viewpoints have influenced methods, algorithms, and implementations in phylogenetics.",

A good outgroup is known to be closely related to the taxa of interest (termed the ingroup). However, the outgroup must be clearly not a member of the ingroup. The underlying logic of the outgroup criterion is that the transformation events that occurred at evolutionary origin of the ingroup can be identified by comparison to modern organisms of another clade but with which the ingroup shares a common ancestor. The common ancestor is a hypothetical organism that provides a baseline set of character states from which polarity determinations can be made. Thus the outgroup method, like Bayesian inference, incorporates some previous knowledge of the relationships of the organisms. If the phylogenetic results show that the ingroup includes some members of the outgroup the previous knowledge must be reevaluated. The outgroup taxon is included in the data matrix of the phylogenetic analysis and the entire data set is analyzed simultaneously. The phylogenetic position and relationships of the outgroup are determined by the optimality criterion. In the case of the parsimony method, the outgroup is treated as any other taxon and is positioned in the tree in the position that minimized tree length. Once the phylogenetic affinities outgroup are established, the outgroup can be used to root the tree, and the polarities of the transformations can be established (note the unidirectional arrows in Fig. 2.4) . If chosen carefully, the outgroup will not be clustered with any of the ingroup. Model based methods can also be used in reconstruction of ancestral character states (e.g., [CHA00, THR04] To communicate the choice of outgroup taxon or taxa and clarify the relationships of the taxa, character based trees are often drawn as directed acyclic graphs with the root positioned on the branch between the outgroup and ingroup.",

Sequence length variation occurs in both coding and noncoding loci. The causes can be genetic drift, mutation, recombination, or horizontal transfer events. The phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequences, like that of all other comparative data, is based on schemes of putative homology that are then tested via phylogenetic analysis. Unlike some other data types, however, putative homologies in molecular data are not directly observable. Sequences from various organisms are often unequal in length. Hence, the correspondences among sequence positions are not evident and some sort of procedure is required to determine which regions are homologous. This procedure is typically multiple sequence alignment. Alignment inserts gaps to make the putatively corresponding residue line up into columns. These columns (characters) comprise the matrix used to reconstruct cladograms. The matrix is then submitted to phylogenetic analysis in the same manner as other forms of data such as morphological characters scored by an investigator. Thus the primary reason in phylogenetics to create an alignment has a strongly operational basis -to make it possible to submit these data to standard phylogeny programs that were designed to handle column vectors of morphological characters. Nevertheless, alignment followed by tree search is the standard procedure.",

In fact, popular multiple alignment programs such as CLUSTAL [THO94] use a guide tree used to construct the alignment. Therefore, methods have been proposed to make a simultaneous estimation of the optimal sequence alignment and the optimal phylogenetic tree [SAN83] . A modern implementation of the one-step concept in POY [WHE05] , termed direct optimization, allows unaligned sequence data to be analyzed without precomputing an alignment. In direct optimization, sequence data are aligned as various trees are built and their optimality is assessed. Thus for each tree considered in a search, various sets of homology statements for the sequence data are considered. One advantage of direct optimization is that the outgroup need not be designated by the investigator. POY allows for randomization of the outgroup taxon and thus adds rigor to the search for optimal trees and homology statements. In some implementations of character-based methods where prealignment is necessary the outgroup can be randomized by scripting a series of analyses, e.g., TNT [GOL03] . One important difference is that in molecular data a rigorous tree search with on a prealigned dataset with unordered characters should lead to the same tree length irrespective of outgroup choice; whereas in direct optimization the homology statements and hence tree length can be dependent on outgroup choice.",

Therefore, this set of known optimal trees must be considered equally valuable.

Several kinds of techniques for consensus estimation exist. The strict consensus tree is one of the most frequently used.

Furthermore, the results indicate that direct shifts from avian to human hosts have occurred 18-27 times independently in different lineages (without observed intermediate hosts). It must be noted that the possibility of an intermediate host in avian-to-human transmission events cannot be completely rejected. It is possible that an intermediate host existed in nature but it was not sampled by the surveillance program and therefore not included in the analysis. However, based on the available evidence, it seems that host shifts from birds to humans have been frequent in the evolutionary history of influenza type A.

Notable among these assertions are the studies in the shape of influenza A phylogeny as viewed through the hemagglutinin (HA) gene Fig. 2.7 . Two character optimizations on the for hemagglutinin (HA) sequences representing 2,358 isolates of influenza A, with an influenza B outgroup at the root. The top tree has an optimization of the character \"HA antigenic subtype\". The lower tree depicts optimization of the character \"host\". Character data was drawn from Genbank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the Influenza Sequence Database (www.flu.lanl.gov). Optimizations and tree graphics were made with Mesquite (www.mesquiteproject.org). For better visualization contact the authors for files in scalable pdf format [BUS99, FER02] . The HA gene codes for a surface glycoprotein of the virion responsible for binding to sialic acid on host cell surface receptors. At a genomic level, lineages of influenza are constantly changing due to mutation that occurs at high rates in RNA viruses. Extinction of evolutionary lineages of viruses to which hosts have become immune or when susceptible hosts are in short supply is common [GRE04] . This process of constant replacement of influenza lineages produces a characteristic coniferous shape to a phylogeny reconstructed from HA sequences [BUS99] . The \"conifer\" metaphor refers to the hypothesis that influenza HA is constantly changing but there is limited diversity at any time [FER02] . Thus an influenza HA tree appears to be formed by addition of strains to the apex of the tree's trunk that contains the contemporary \"infectious\" viruses rather than more basal presumably \"extinct\" lineages to which hosts are immune. Other groups of researchers have used the assumption that there is limited influenza A diversity at any one time to downplay the utility of phylogenetic approaches [PLO02] . As an alternative to phylogenetics, which they consider difficult, these groups make predictions based on size of various clusters of related isolates, termed \"swarms\" [PLO02] . Several groups, whether using trees or swarms, have identified putatively dominant strains of influenza to predict the genetic makeup of future viral populations [PLO02] [BUS99] .",

Our results show that this correlation between branching pattern and dates of viral isolation is good in that it significantly differs from a random expectation. This is true over the entire tree as well as when some individual lineages are measured. However, the relative quality of surveillance differs markedly between lineages. One example of differential surveillance quality occurs in two closely related groups of avian influenza of H5 hemagglutinin subtype. One group in this example contains the highly pathogenic H5N1 strains that currently circulate in Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa. This large clade has been the focus of intense surveillance since the discovery of widespread infection among wild and domestic birds and some avian-to-human transmission [YUA02, UNG05] . The H5N1 viral isolates form a sister clade to H5N2 known from domestic and wild bird in the Americas (H5N2). The number of available hemagglutinin sequences of H5N2 comprise less than one fifth of the number of HA sequences for H5N1. This in itself represents a measure of the surveillance intensity devoted to these two groups of avian influenza. However, even if the number of sequences is normalized at 100 sequences to perform the MSM test, the surveillance quality of the H5N1 clade is far superior to the H5N2 clade.",

Characters can be polymorphisms recognized in columns of aligned nucleotides or amino acids from sequences of interest or phenotypic states such as host, date of isolation, or antigenic subtype. Another feature of most character based methods that differs from NJ is that character based methods examine many randomly generated trees (each representing an evolutionary hypothesis of character transformations and organismal relationships). Thus the concepts of optimality and hypothesis testing are tightly associated with cladistic and maximum likelihood inference. Optimal trees represent more defensible hypotheses. Moreover, character based methods of molecular phylogenetics rely on explicit choices of outgroup to make assumptions about ancestral character states and thus polarize transformations of phenotypes and genotypes that can be reconstructed from data. In order to make an explicit assumption of ancestral character states the investigator designates at least one taxon as the outgroup. The outgroup method originated in cladistics [WAT81] and has become central to the phylogenetic inference [NIX94] . If chosen carefully, the outgroup estimates baseline character states in sequence and phenotypes such that transformations (such as host shifts) can be reliably inferred. To illustrate the choice of outgroup taxon or taxa and clarify the relationships of the organisms, character based trees are often rooted from the outgroup and ingroup.",

In direct optimization, sequence data are aligned as various trees are built and their optimality is assessed (using maximum likelihood and cladistic optimality criteria as specified by the investigator). Thus for each tree a specific alignment that is optimal for that tree is constructed. One additional advantage of direct optimization is that the outgroup need not be designated by the investigator but rather randomized during the search for optimal trees and alignments. In some implementations of character based methods where prealignment is necessary, the outgroup can be randomized by scripting a series of analyses. Outgroup randomization enables analyses of taxa where previous knowledge of ingroup/outgroup relationships is lacking or is among the hypotheses the investigator wants to test via tree search.",
