On March 12, 2003, WHO issued a global alert for an emerging and yet unknown illness that was subsequently known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV).1 SARS-CoV caused more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths in over 30 countries with a substantial economic impact.2 Since then, several other viral respiratory pathogens (table 1\n)3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 have emerged including avian influenza (H5N1, H7N9, H10N8), variant influenza A H3N2 virus, human adenovirus-14, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Soon after the discovery of SARS, additional coronaviruses were also identified: coronavirus NL63 and coronavirus HKU1.3, 4\n",

In 1947, WHO established its GISN, now known as the GISRS. The new name followed the adoption of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) framework in May 2011.23 GISRS is a network of national influenza centres and laboratories. These centres serve as laboratory-based surveillance system to monitor circulating influenza viruses and make annual recommendations on the composition of influenza vaccine for the northern and southern hemispheres. GISRS also detects as early as possible, characterises, and tracks any unusual influenza strains in human populations that could be of pandemic potential. Multiple national influenza centres (NICs) collect virus specimens in their country, do preliminary analysis, and ship representative clinical specimens and isolated viruses to WHO for advanced analysis.24 The network comprises six WHO Collaborating Centres, four WHO essential regulatory laboratories, and 141 institutions in 111 WHO member states.25 NICs are concentrated in Europe and the USA, with only a few centres in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of southeast Asia. As a result, there is an absence of knowledge about influenza epidemiology, burden of disease, and patterns of transmission in the tropics and subtropics. The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) is a worldwide initiative that involves the gathering of many networks and individuals involved in research related to the outbreaks of diseases such as avian influenza A H5N1, swine influenza A H1N1, and SARS.26 ISARIC is involved in the collaboration between different scientists to further increase our understanding of emerging respiratory diseases. ISARIC provides a collaborative platform through which worldwide, patient-oriented clinical studies can be developed, done, and disseminated, with shared protocols and a focus on clinical questions and clinical trial expertise.",

This information also helps in selecting future vaccine strains. The surveillance also monitors the emergence of any viral resistance.27 The basic goals of influenza surveillance include description of the epidemiology of seasonal influenza and burden of disease, provision of isolates for identification of viruses and monitoring of resistance, and provision of country-specific data for programme planning and preparedness. After the re-emergence of highly-pathogenic influenza A H5N1 in 2004, another objective was to provide an early warning for outbreaks of novel influenza or agents of SARI in human beings or the circulation of a potentially new pandemic pathogen. The main aim of pandemic surveillance is the early recognition of the emergence of a novel virus so that control measures can be instituted. However, once a pandemic has begun, surveillance should switch to monitoring of the epidemiology, the characteristics of the virus, the effect of prevention and control measures, and the progression of the pandemic.28\n",

The important functions of early warning surveillance systems are many. The early warning system is built to detect events with potential public health threat across international borders, to verify detected events, to assess the risk that an event will have global effect, to report such risk within 48 h of the event determination according to the International Health Regulations, and to work with WHO to establish any public health emergency of international concern.29 For early warning systems to work, specific triggers or signal criteria are needed for immediate reporting of possible occurrence of a single or multiple cases; such cases might be the initial indicators of the emergence of a novel respiratory virus with a pandemic potential such as H5N1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",

In New York, a rise in the number of cases of respiratory syndrome and fever provided the earliest indication of the occurrence of community-wide influenza activity in 2001\u201302 seasons.51 An advantage of sentinel syndromic surveillance is the early detection of syndromes before laboratory confirmation.51 Syndromic surveillance could depend on the presence of specific symptoms of the ILI and SARI and could also depend on the chief or primary complaints of patients. The accuracy of chief complaint had a good agreement for the syndromes of respiratory infection in reference to discharge diagnosis.38, 51 Syndromic surveillance helped detect the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 outbreak in the USA55 and was used in emergency departments in Canada to predict circulating respiratory viral disease such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.56\n",

On Feb 10, 2003, a request for information was posted on ProMED in relation to an epidemic in Guangzhou.95 This epidemic became known as SARS.
