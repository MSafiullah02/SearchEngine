The mucosal immune system defends the ocular surface against antigenic challenge (Franklin, 1989; McClellan, 1997; Montgomery et al., 1994; Montgomery and Whittum-Hudson, 1996; Sack et al., 2001; . This immunologic role is mediated primarily through secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) antibodies, which are known to inhibit viral adhesion and internalization; prevent bacterial attachment, colonization, and activity; interfere with parasitic infestation; and reduce antigen-related damage in mucosal sites (Childers et al., 1989; Mestecky and McGhee, 1987; Ogra et al., 1999; Underdown and Schiff, 1986) . Thus, the ocular mucosal immune system protects the eye against allergic, inflammatory, and infectious disease, thereby promoting conjunctival and corneal integrity and preserving visual acuity. This chapter reviews the immunologic architecture and regulation of the ocular mucosal immune system and explores the effect of ocular infection and autoimmune disease on this system's structure and function.

Knop and Knop (2000) analyzed whole mounts of normal human conjunctival sacs and determined that the associated lymphoid tissue contains all of the components necessary for an immune response and that expression of IgA and SC indicates that the conjunctiva belongs to the mucosal immune system. Lymphoid tissue was mainly observed in the palpebral conjunctiva, more pronounced in the upper lid than the lower. Diffuse lymphoid tissue of lymphocytes (predominantly T cells) and plasma cells (most of which were IgA + ) formed a thin layer in the lamina propria of all of the conjunctival sacs. The overlying epithelium produced SC. In three fifths of the specimens, organized follicular accumulations having a lenticular shape, composed of B lymphocytes, and covered by a lymphoepithelium were embedded in the diffuse lymphoid layer. High endothelial venules were present in all types of lymphoid tissue (Knop and Knop, 1996 , 2000 . Unlike the M cell-containing follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) covering Peyer's patches, no differences between the appearance of the microvilli of conjunctival FAE and that of nonfollicle-associated epithelium were noted by transmission electron microscopy in 13 mammalian species (Chodosh et al., 1998b; Chodosh and Kennedy, 2002) . Using ultrastructural methods, other investigators were able to demonstrate M cells in the CALT of rabbits (Knop and Knop, 2005b) . Despite the apparent ubiquity of conjunctival lymphoid follicles in rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, pigs, sheep, cows, rhesus monkeys, baboons, owl monkeys, bush baby monkeys, and humans, few or no lymphoid tissues were identified in mice or rats (Setzer et al., 1987; Chodosh et al., 1998b) . CALT was reported on the nictitating membrane of only 1 of 18 eyes of untreated BALB/c mice, although more was seen after ovalbumin treatment (Sakimoto et al., 2002) or after repeated challenge with Chlamydia trachomatis serovar C or a solution of ovalbumin and cholera toxin B (Steven et al., 2008) , indicating that although CALT is not present in normal mouse conjunctiva, it is inducible. Conjunctival lymphoid follicles have recently been reported in the eyes of 7 of 15 New World rodents (Astley et al., 2007) . These authors suggest that the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) might serve as a useful model species for studying ocular infections and immunology of the eye. The presence of organized CALT appears to be related to antigenic exposure, as evidenced by the rapid increase in conjunctival lymphoid tissue in early youth, a reduced amount under germfree conditions, and a slow decline with advancing age (Osterlind, 1944; McMaster et al., 1967) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 139, "text": "(Axelrod and Chandler, 1979;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 140, "end": 165, "text": "Franklin and Remus, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 166, "end": 181, "text": "Latkovic, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 182, "end": 196, "text": "Ruskell, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF290"}, {"start": 197, "end": 217, "text": "Knop and Knop, 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 218, "end": 242, "text": "Chodosh et al., 1998a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 243, "end": 269, "text": "Chodosh and Kennedy, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 314, "end": 329, "text": "(Kessing, 1968;", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 330, "end": 354, "text": "Allansmith et al., 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 420, "end": 440, "text": "(Sacks et al., 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF295"}, {"start": 441, "end": 458, "text": "Dua et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 459, "end": 482, "text": "Hingorani et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 767, "end": 789, "text": "Franklin et al.

Other bonemarrow-derived leukocytes reside in the conjunctiva and act mainly for the innate immune system. An immunohistological study reported CD68 + macrophages as the second most prevalent leukocyte population in the conjunctiva (Hingorani et al., 1997) . Dendritic Langerhans cells are regularly found, express activation markers, and function as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs; Chandler and Gillette, 1983) . They are critical regulators of immunity and link innate and adaptive immune effector mechanisms (Banchereau and Steinman, 1998) . Mast cells produce factors, including cytokines, which recruit other leukocytes and orchestrate inflammatory reactions to destroy pathogens (Morgan et al., 1991) . Granulocytes only emigrate from the blood if recruited (Allansmith et al., 1978; Knop and Knop, 2000) . When the topographical distribution of CALT is projected onto the ocular surface, it overlies the cornea during eye closure and is therefore in a suitable position to mediate corneal immune protection during blinking and overnight. The CALT has the capacity to detect corneal antigens and to prime effector cells as well as distributing protective factors such as S-IgA (Knop and Knop, 2005a) . The lacrimal drainage system is continuous with the conjunctiva via the lacrimal puncta and canaliculi. The epithelium is a stratified squamous, nonkeratinized layer inside of the canaliculi and becomes a pseudostratified epithelium with columnar ciliated cells in the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct (Knop and Knop, 2001) . The mucosa contains diffuse lymphatic tissue and organized follicles, similar to the lymphoid tissue observed in the conjunctiva. IgA + plasma cells and the IgA transporter protein, SC, are demonstrated in the lamina propria and the overlying epithelium, respectively, indicating local production of specific S-IgA. These components contribute to ocular mucosal secretory immunity and have been termed lacrimal drainage-associated lymphoid tissue (LDALT) Knop, 2001, 2005a; Paulsen, 2003; Paulsen et al., 2000 Paulsen et al., , 2002 Paulsen et al., , 2003 or tear duct-associated lymphoid tissue (Nagatake et al., 2009) .

Whereas the conjunctiva is a highly reactive tissue that is protected by a potent immune system, the cornea is relatively unreactive, with the immune system repressed to some extent to avoid inflammatory reactions that could compromise the cornea's transparency. Defense is aided by cell polarity, tight cell junctions, and continual replacement of the epithelium. The epithelium produces very high levels of membrane-bound complement inhibitors and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2, and it has the ability to produce alpha2-macroglobulin and alpha1-antiproteinase, thereby reducing the risk of autologous cell damage (Sack et al., 2001) . The cornea also produces very high levels of antioxidants (Rose et al., 1998 ) that may protect the ocular surface from reactive oxygen species produced by activated polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. The cornea possesses interstitial IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE, which appear to originate from serum, diffuse from the limbal to central regions, and require extended time periods (e.g., months) for complete turnover (Allansmith and McClellan, 1975; Verhagen et al., 1990; Pleyer et al., 1996) . SC is not produced by the \"normal\" avascular corneal epithelium or stroma . The peripheral cornea, which is in close contact with the conjunctival vasculature, may also contain Langerhans cells and macrophages (Pleyer et al., 1996) . Although early studies determined that lymphocytes and differentiated Langerhans cells are essentially absent from the normal central cornea (Allansmith et al., 1978; Seto et al., 1987) , subsequent studies using immunohistochemical confocal microscopic analyses of rodent corneal whole mounts have demonstrated the presence of small numbers of CD3 + T cells (both CD4 + and CD8 + ), macrophages, and dendritic cells (Langerhans cells), but no B cells, in the peripheral cornea and limbus (Yang et al., 1998) . In addition to these peripheral cells, a novel major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-negative population of resident corneal Langerhans-type dendritic cells has been identified in the central cornea of mice (Hamrah et al., 2002) and humans (Yamagami et al., 2005a,b) . The corneal stroma is endowed with at least three bone-marrow-derived dendritic cell subsets (Hamrah et al., 2003) as well as a novel macrophage population (Brissette-Storkus et al., 2002) . These dendritic cell subsets demonstrate an interesting stratification within noninflamed murine corneas that suggests a progression from APC function at the exposed surface to an innate immune barrier function deeper in the stroma (Knickelbein et al., 2009) . In inflammation, these dendritic cells become activated, as evidenced by expression of B7 co-stimulatory markers, and after corneal transplantation they express MHC class II and migrate to the draining lymph nodes (Liu et al., 2002b; Hamrah et al., 2003) . These findings refute the tenet that the cornea is immune privileged because of a lack of resident lymphoreticular cells or because of antigenic sequestration from systemic immunity. Membranebound or soluble chemotactic factors, locally produced in the periphery, prevent Langerhans cell migration from the limbus unless a stronger stimulus (e.g., IL-1) is produced. IL-1\u03b2 is secreted by corneal epithelial cells in response to interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 or bacterial infection (Wakefield and Lloyd, 1992) . Further, normal keratocytes express MHC class II molecules in response to inflammation, suggesting that keratocytes collaborate with APCs in antigen presentation to T cells, leading to activation of the humoral response, cell-mediated immunity, and inflammation (Niederkorn, 1990) . During inflammation, macrophages and neutrophils extravasate from the vasculature and generate cytokines, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b2, which facilitate T cell and B cell differentiation and activation. Cytokines produced by immune cells and keratocytes exacerbate the inflammatory response, complement-mediated cytotoxicity, and angiogenesis. To counter the cytotoxic damage that may ensue from inflammation, the cornea protects itself by producing TGF-\u03b2, which suppresses cell-mediated immune responses, and Fas-L, which prevents cell-mediated damage to the epithelial cells (Sack et al., 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 787, "end": 806, "text": "(Sack et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}, {"start": 867, "end": 885, "text": "(Rose et al., 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF288"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1254, "text": "(Allansmith and McClellan, 1975;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1277, "text": "Verhagen et al., 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF353"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1298, "text": "Pleyer et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF272"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1532, "text": "(Pleyer et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF272"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1701, "text": "(Allansmith et al., 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1720, "text": "Seto et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF305"}, {"start": 2024, "end": 2043, "text": "(Yang et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF377"}, {"start": 2263, "end": 2284, "text": "(Hamrah et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2322, "text": "(Yamagami et al., 2005a,b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2418, "end": 2439, "text": "(Hamrah et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 2481, "end": 2513, "text": "(Brissette-Storkus et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2748, "end": 2774, "text": "(Knickelbein et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 2991, "end": 3010, "text": "(Liu et al., 2002b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 3011, "end": 3031, "text": "Hamrah et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 3504, "end": 3531, "text": "(Wakefield and Lloyd, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF356"}, {"start": 3796, "end": 3814, "text": "(Niederkorn, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF241"}, {"start": 4457, "end": 4476, "text": "(Sack et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cornea"}, {"text": "The preocular tear film plays a critical role in the eye's defense against microbial and antigenic exposure as well as in the maintenance of corneal clarity and visual ability (Holly, 1987; Lemp and Marquardt, 1992; Lemp, 1995; Rolando and Zierhut, 2001) . These functions are extremely dependent on the stability, tonicity, and composition of the tear film structure, the actual architecture of which is still not totally resolved. The smooth refractive tear film is maintained by the blinking of the eyelid to replenish the tears over the surface of the cornea. Early hypotheses of tear film architecture considered it to have three distinct layers, including an underlying mucin layer adjacent to the epithelial surface; a middle aqueous component; and a thin overlying lipid layer secreted from the conjunctival goblet cells, the lacrimal glands, and the meibomian glands, respectively (Holly, 1987; Whitcher, 1987; Dartt, 1992; Dartt and Sullivan, 2000) . More recent models indicate that the mucins are mixed within the aqueous tear fluid, with the mucins having a decreasing gradient of concentration from the epithelium to the surface, and an overlying lipid layer (Dilly, 1994; Gipson, 2004; Spurr-Michaud et al., 2007; Tiffany, 2008) . Specialization of the apical surface membrane where it abuts the tear film facilitates the maintenance of fluids on the ocular surface. A heavily glycosylated glycocalyx formed by membrane-associated mucins extends from the tips of surface ridges (microplicae). The extracellular domains of these mucins are shed constitutively into the tear film (Gipson, 2007; Gipson and Argueso, 2003; Govindarajan and Gipson, 2010; Khanal and Millar, 2010) .

Lactoferrin represents 25% of the total reflex tear protein and has several functions. It enhances the function of natural killer cells, it deprives bacteria of iron, and it inhibits the formation of biologically active complement by inhibiting the formation of C3 convertase (Arnold et al., 1982; Kijlstra et al., 1983; Kievits and Kijlstra, 1985; Mestecky and McGhee, 1987; Caccavo et al., 2002) . The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial functions of lactoferrin are attributed to its capacity to bind divalent cations and numerous ligands as well as its basically charged peptide sequence near the N-terminus. Lactoferrin inhibits complement activation, decreases the capacity of PMN cells to release oxygen radical species, and chelates iron, thereby depriving many bacteria of a necessary nutrient. Lactoferrin destabilizes the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria by its chelation actions.

Moreover, the magnitude of induced ocular immunity may be altered by the use of adjuvants (Peppard et al., 1988; Peppard and Montgomery, 1990) , cytokines (Pockley and Montgomery, 1991; Rafferty et al., 1996) , immunostimulatory DNA (Gill and Montgomery, 2002) , and microspheres (Rafferty et al., 1996; Ridley Lathers et al., 1998) and influenced by the concurrent state of systemic immunity (Waldman and Bergmann, 1987) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 319, "text": "(Mestecky et al., 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF219"}, {"start": 437, "end": 465, "text": "(Jackson and Mestecky, 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 466, "end": 490, "text": "Allansmith et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1105, "text": "Montgomery and Whittum-Hudson (1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1220, "text": "(Peppard et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1250, "text": "Peppard and Montgomery, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1293, "text": "(Pockley and Montgomery, 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF275"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1316, "text": "Rafferty et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF277"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1368, "text": "(Gill and Montgomery, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1411, "text": "(Rafferty et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF277"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1440, "text": "Ridley Lathers et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF284"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1529, "text": "(Waldman and Bergmann, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF359"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Response to Defined Antigens"}, {"text": "The mechanism by which antigenic exposure to the surface of the eye stimulates a local immune (e.g., IgA) response remains to be elucidated. Direct antigen transfer across the conjunctival epithelium or countercurrent passage through the lacrimal duct appears to be severely restricted (Huang et al., 1989; Kahn et al., 1990; Sullivan et al., 1998) . Furthermore, the immunologic architecture of healthy lacrimal tissue appears to limit its capacity to effectively process and present antigen (Wieczorek et al., 1988) . With respect to conjunctival tissue, it is now evident that it is endowed with lymphoid tissue capable of antigen uptake and processing, as is the lacrimal drainage system Knop, 2001, 2002a,b; Paulsen, 2003; Paulsen et al., 2000 Paulsen et al., , 2002 Paulsen et al., , 2003 Nagatake et al., 2009) . It was once postulated that the ocular secretory immune response to infectious or toxic substances may require antigenic clearance through the nasolacrimal duct and stimulation of intranasal and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Consistent with the hypothesis that NALT is required for the induction of tear IgA antibody responses are the following observations: (1) topical application of noninvasive antigens to the rat ocular surface appears to result in passage through the nasolacrimal canal into the gastrointestinal tract, and not retrograde transfer to the lacrimal gland or lymphatic drainage into local lymph nodes (Sullivan et al., 1998) . Likewise, herpes simplex virus in human tears has been shown to flow through the lacrimal canaliculi into the nasal cavity (Yoshida and Hondo, 1992) ; (2) intranasal, oral, or gastric administration of bacteria, viruses, or other antigens may induce the accumulation of specific tear IgA antibodies and the generation of ocular surface protection (Mestecky et al., 1978; Nichols et al., 1978; Montgomery et al., 1983 Montgomery et al., , 1984a Bergmann et al., 1986; Waldman and Bergmann, 1987; Czerkinsky et al., 1987; Van Zaane et al., 1987; Peppard et al., 1988; Peppard and Montgomery, 1990; Davidson et al., 1993; Carr et al., 1996; Noriega et al., 1996; Montgomery and Rafferty, 1998; Ridley Lathers et al., 1998; Gill and Montgomery, 2002) .

Multiple sclerosis, an auto-immune disease of possible viral origin, is associated with heightened levels of monomeric IgA and reduced amounts of SC in the tears of afflicted individuals (Coyle, 1989 ). Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that occurs almost exclusively in females, is characterized by a progressive lymphocytic infiltration into the lacrimal gland, an immune-mediated destruction of lacrimal acinar and ductal epithelial cells, decreased tear IgA content, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Moutsopoulos and Talal, 1987; Kincaid, 1987; Homma et al., 1994; Sullivan, 1994) . Furthermore, in experimental models of this complex disorder, the generation of autoantibodies (Ohashi et al., 1985) and autoreactive T cells to (Tsubata et al., 1996) , and the deposition of IgG, IgA, and complement in ductal epithelial cells of (deLuise et al., 1982) , lacrimal tissue may accompany the striking glandular inflammation (Jabs et al., 1985; Jabs and Prendergast, 1988; Tsubata et al., 1996; Takahashi et al., 1996; Robinson et al., 1998; van Blokland and Versnel, 2002) .

These viruses have been identified in the lacrimal and/or salivary tissues of Sj\u00f6gren's patients (Burns, 1983; Fox et al., 1986; Fox, 1988; Krueger et al., 1990; Garry et al., 1990; Mariette et al., 1991; Pflugfelder et al., 1993; Tsubota et al., 1995; Pepose et al., 1996) and may possibly stimulate the inappropriate epithelial cell human leukocyte antigen-DR and Toll-like receptor expression, T helper/inducer cell activation, B cell hyperactivity, and autoantibody production evident in these affected tissues (Moutsopoulos and Talal, 1987; Maini, 1987; Fox, 1988; Homma et al., 1994; Berglova et al., 2011; Lambiase et al., 2011) . In support of this possibility, certain viral infections in experimental animals exert a striking effect on the lacrimal gland and induce a periductular infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages; distinct nonsuppurative periductular inflammation; significant interstitial edema; widespread necrosis of the acinar and ductal epithelium; degenerative and atrophic alterations in epithelial cells; diminished tear flow; and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Jacoby et al., 1975; Green et al., 1989) . Moreover, herpes viruses (i.e., cytomegalovirus) and coronaviruses (i.e., sialodacryoadenitis virus) may invade and replicate in rat lacrimal gland acinar cells Wickham et al., 1997) , Epstein-Barr virus may bind to specific receptors in ductal epithelium of the human lacrimal gland (Levine et al., 1990) , and HIV infection may predispose patients to keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Couderc et al., 1987; Ulirsch and Jaffe, 1987; De Clerck et al., 1988; Lucca et al., 1990; Neves et al., 1994) . The precise role of viruses in the induction of autoimmune disease, as well as the mechanism by which viral infection may interfere with lacrimal gland function and immune expression, is becoming understood. There is increasing evidence that environmental factors such as viral infection or hypoestrogenism trigger Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome in persons carrying susceptibility genes that predispose enhanced innate immunity via type 1 IFN pathway proteins, leading to activation of lacrimal and salivary gland epithelial cells. Subsequent autoantigen presentation by the epithelial cells leads to T cell activation and overproduction of B cell activating factor, induced by IFN, and stimulates B cell activation and initiation of adaptive immunity as well as the production of autoantibodies (Manoussakis and Kapsogeorgou, 2010; Mavragani and Crow, 2010; Low and Witte, 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 332,

and nervous systems regulate multiple aspects of cellular and humoral immunity. This hormonal and neural control, which significantly influences such parameters as lymphocyte differentiation and maturation, antigen presentation, cytokine production, cell migration, and antibody synthesis, is regulated by two major mechanisms: (1) the hormonal stress response with the production of glucocorticoids and (2) the autonomic nervous system with the release of noradrenalin (Webster et al., 2002; Sternberg, 2006) . The central nervous system can also regulate the immune system locally via the release of neuropeptides from peripheral nerves and by locally produced corticotrophin-releasing hormone (Elenkov et al., 2000; Wrona, 2006; Nance and Sanders, 2007; Levite, 2008; Thayer and Sternberg, 2010; Levite, 2000 Levite, , 2008 . Moreover, this neuroendocrine-immune interrelationship is bidirectional, and antigenic exposure may also induce the lymphocytic secretion of cytokines, hormones, and neuropeptides that directly modulate endocrine and neural function (Mulla and Buckingham, 1999; Besedovsky and del Rey, 2000; Smith, 2008) . In fact, it has been proposed that the immune system serves as a sensory organ, providing input to the endocrine and nervous compartments in response to noncognitive stimuli, such as infection (Blalock, 1984; Blalock and Smith, 2007) . Consequently, an extensive, triangular association appears to exist between the endocrine, nervous, and the innate and adaptive immune systems that acts to promote and maintain homeostasis (Befus et al., 1999; Petrovsky, 2001; Webster et al., 2002; Eskandari and Sternberg, 2002; Sternberg, 2006; Irwin and Cole, 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 527, "end": 549, "text": "(Webster et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF362"}, {"start": 550, "end": 566, "text": "Sternberg, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF321"}, {"start": 753, "end": 775, "text": "(Elenkov et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 776, "end": 788, "text": "Wrona, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF374"}, {"start": 789, "end": 813, "text": "Nance and Sanders, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 814, "end": 827, "text": "Levite, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF194"}, {"start": 828, "end": 855, "text": "Thayer and Sternberg, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF341"}, {"start": 856, "end": 868, "text": "Levite, 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 869, "end": 883, "text": "Levite, , 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF194"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1147, "text": "(Mulla and Buckingham, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1177, "text": "Besedovsky and del Rey, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1190, "text": "Smith, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF312"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1401, "text": "(Blalock, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1426, "text": "Blalock and Smith, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1638, "text": "(Befus et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1655, "text": "Petrovsky, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1677, "text": "Webster et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF362"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1708, "text": "Eskandari and Sternberg, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1725, "text": "Sternberg, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF321"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1747, "text": "Irwin and Cole, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neuroendocrine Modulation"}, {"text": "Likewise, in the mucosal immune system, diverse hormones and neural agonists may significantly modify the (1) accumulation, proliferation, retention, and/or function of various innate and adaptive immune system cells;", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neuroendocrine Modulation"}, {"text": "(2) synthesis and expression of IgA and IgG antibodies, growth factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules, apoptotic factors, MHC class II antigens, SC, and the uptake and transport of pIgA into luminal secretions; and (3) adherence and presentation of microorganisms to mucosal cells, the magnitude of neurogenic inflammation, and the extent of local immune protection against infectious agents.

With regard to the ocular mucosal immune system, endocrine (androgens, but not estrogens or stress hormones) and neural factors appear to exert a dramatic effect on immunologic expression and activity. This neuroendocrine-immune interrelationship has been definitively shown in the eyes of experimental animals and is likely to occur in humans (Khandelwal et al., 2012) . In rats, androgens elicit a marked increase in the production and secretion of SC by lacrimal gland acinar cells Kelleher et al., 1991; Lambert et al., 1994; Sullivan et al., 1998) , enhance the concentration of IgA in lacrimal tissue (Sullivan et al., 1998) , and stimulate the transfer and accumulation of SC and IgA, but not IgG, in tears (Sullivan and Edwards, 1997; Sullivan et al., 1998) . These hormone actions, which may be induced by various androgenic compounds (Sullivan et al., 1998) , are not duplicated by estrogen, progestin, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid treatment (Sullivan and Edwards, 1997; Sullivan et al., 1998) . Moreover, the immunologic effects of androgens appear to be unique to the eye because androgen administration does not seem to influence IgA or SC levels in salivary, respiratory, intestinal, uterine, or bladder tissues (Sullivan et al., 1998) and actually suppresses mucosal immunity in the mammary gland (Weisz-Carrington et al., 1978) . The mechanism by which androgens regulate ocular SC dynamics may well involve hormone association with specific nuclear receptors in lacrimal gland acinar cells, binding of these androgen/receptor complexes to genomic acceptor sites, and the promotion of SC mRNA transcription and translation. In support of this hypothesis, saturable, high-affinity, and androgen-specific receptors, which adhere to DNA, have been identified in lacrimal tissue (Ota et al., 1985; Sullivan et al., 1998) . In addition, androgens increase SC mRNA levels in lacrimal glands (Gao et al., 1995) . Androgen-induced SC production by acinar cells may be inhibited by androgen receptor (cyproterone acetate), transcription (actinomycin D), or translation (cycloheximide) antagonists (Lambert et al., 1994) . In contrast, the in vivo processes underlying androgen action on IgA in the rat eye, as well as this hormone's enhancement of tear IgA levels in the mouse (Sullivan and Edwards, 1997) , remain to be determined. Although estrogen and progesterone regulate numerous genes in the mouse lacrimal gland, they do not appear to be a major factor underlying the sexual dimorphism of gene expression in lacrimal tissue . In contrast, testosterone regulates the expression of over 2000 genes in lacrimal and meibomian glands and in meibomian and conjunctival cells, and androgen action is mediated through classical androgen receptors and may contribute to the sex-related differences in gene expression in the lacrimal gland (Richards et al., 2005 Sullivan et al., 2009) . This may explain the pronounced, sex-related differences in the rat ocular secretory immune system, in which the number of IgA-containing cells, and the IgA and SC output, are significantly greater in adult male lacrimal tissue as compared with that of adult females. This sexual dimorphism also extends to tears, in which from puberty to senescence, free SC and IgA, but not IgG, occur in considerably higher levels in male rats Sullivan et al., 1998) . Indeed, androgen influence may well be involved in the distinct sex-associated differences in the structural appearance, histochemistry, biochemistry, immunology, and molecular biologic expression of the lacrimal gland in various species, including mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits, and humans (Waterhouse, 1963; Cavallero, 1967; Hahn, 1969; Lauria and Porcelli, 1979; Cornell-Bell et al., 1985; Cripps et al., 1986; Sullivan and Allansmith, 1988; Hann et al., 1988; Pangerl et al., 1989; Mircheff et al., 1991; Azzarolo et al., 1993; Gao et al., 1995; Sullivan et al., , 1998 Toda et al., 1999; Rocha et al., 1997; Marcozzi et al., 2000; Madia et al., 2001; Richards et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2002a) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 277, "text": "(Wagner et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF355"}, {"start": 624, "end": 649, "text": "(Khandelwal et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 765, "end": 787, "text": "Kelleher et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 788, "end": 809, "text": "Lambert et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 810, "end": 832, "text": "Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 887, "end": 910, "text": "(Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 994, "end": 1022, "text": "(Sullivan and Edwards, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF333"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1045, "text": "Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1147, "text": "(Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1268, "text": "(Sullivan and Edwards, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF333"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1291, "text": "Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1537, "text": "(Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1631, "text": "(Weisz-Carrington et al., 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF364"}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2097, "text": "(Ota et al., 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF258"}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2120, "text": "Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 2189, "end": 2207, "text": "(Gao et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2414, "text": "(Lambert et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 2572, "end": 2600, "text": "(Sullivan and Edwards, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF333"}, {"start": 3133, "end": 3155, "text": "(Richards et al., 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 3156, "end": 3178, "text": "Sullivan et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF337"}, {"start": 3611, "end": 3633, "text": "Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 3940, "end": 3958, "text": "(Waterhouse, 1963;", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}, {"start": 3959, "end": 3975, "text": "Cavallero, 1967;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3976, "end": 3987, "text": "Hahn, 1969;", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 3988, "end": 4014, "text": "Lauria and Porcelli, 1979;", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 4015, "end": 4041, "text": "Cornell-Bell et al., 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 4042, "end": 4062, "text": "Cripps et al., 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 4063, "end": 4093, "text": "Sullivan and Allansmith, 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF329"}, {"start": 4094, "end": 4112, "text": "Hann et al., 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 4113, "end": 4134, "text": "Pangerl et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF260"}, {"start": 4135, "end": 4157, "text": "Mircheff et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 4158, "end": 4180, "text": "Azzarolo et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4181, "end": 4198, "text": "Gao et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 4199, "end": 4222, "text": "Sullivan et al., , 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 4223, "end": 4241, "text": "Toda et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF344"}, {"start": 4242, "end": 4261, "text": "Rocha et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF286"}, {"start": 4262, "end": 4284, "text": "Marcozzi et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 4285, "end": 4304, "text": "Madia et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 4305, "end": 4327, "text": "Richards et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 4328, "end": 4346, "text": "Liu et al., 2002a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neuroendocrine Modulation"}, {"text": "With respect to humans, sex appears to influence the (1) degree of lymphocyte accumulation in the lacrimal gland (Waterhouse, 1963) ; (2) IgA concentrations in tears of adults (Sen et al., 1978) , but not the elderly (Sand et al., 1986) ; (3) the levels of TGF-\u03b1 and EGF in tears (van Setten and Schultz, 1994; Barton et al., 1998) ; and (4) the frequency of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome-related lacrimal gland immunopathology (Moutsopoulos and Talal, 1987; Kincaid, 1987; Fox, 1992; Homma et al., 1994; .

Disruption of this axis by hypophysectomy or extirpation of the anterior pituitary of the rat significantly reduces the number of IgA plasma cells in lacrimal tissue; diminishes the acinar cell production of SC, causes a striking decrease in the levels of tear IgA and SC; and almost completely curtails androgen action on ocular mucosal immunity (Gao et al., 1995; Sullivan et al., 1998) . Moreover, this endocrine disturbance has a marked effect on lacrimal gland structure and function, leading to glandular atrophy, acinar cell contraction, nuclear pycnosis, cytoplasmic vacuolar metamorphosis, a decrease in tissue protein and mRNA content, and a decline in fluid and protein secretion (Azzarolo et al., 1992; Sullivan et al., 1998) . The physiologic mechanisms responsible for hypothalamic-pituitary involvement in the ocular secretory immune system remain to be elucidated, but they may include numerous neuroendocrine and immunologic pathways. The hypothalamus and pituitary regulate multiple endocrine circuits, directly influence neural innervation in the lacrimal gland, and clearly modulate immune activity (Berczi, 1990; Berczi and Nagy, 1990) . Furthermore, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is known to control many hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines that modify androgen and acinar cell function and control mucosal immunity (Mooradian et al., 1987; Sullivan et al., 1998) . Other studies in humans or experimental animals demonstrated that (1) sex steroids may significantly alter the development of allergic conjunctivitis in rabbits (Saruya, 1968) ; (2) diabetes may enhance the incidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Ramos-Remus et al., 1994) and significantly diminish the expression of the secretory immune system of the eye, most likely related to the absence of insulin (Jackson and Hutson, 1984; Hann et al., 1991; Sullivan et al., 1998) ; and (3) both the thyroid and adrenal glands are essential to achieve the full magnitude of androgen-induced effects on the secretory immune system of the eye (Sullivan et al., 1998) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 496, "end": 514, "text": "(Gao et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 515, "end": 537, "text": "Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 840, "end": 863, "text": "(Azzarolo et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 864, "end": 886, "text": "Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1282, "text": "(Berczi, 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1305, "text": "Berczi and Nagy, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1496, "end": 1520, "text": "(Mooradian et al., 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1543, "text": "Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1721, "text": "(Saruya, 1968)", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1819, "text": "(Ramos-Remus et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1951, "end": 1977, "text": "(Jackson and Hutson, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1996, "text": "Hann et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1997, "end": 2019, "text": "Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 2180, "end": 2203, "text": "(Sullivan et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neuroendocrine Modulation"}, {"text": "With respect to neural regulation of ocular mucosal immunity, the stromal, periductal, perivascular, and/or acinar areas of lacrimal tissue are innervated by many parasympathetic, sympathetic, and peptidergic fibers that harbor numerous immunoactive transmitters, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P, neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, methionine enkephalin, leucine enkephalin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and adrenergic and cholinergic agents (Ruskell, 1971; Nikkinen et al., 1984; Walcott, 1990; Dartt, 1992; Williams et al., 1994; Seifert et al., 1996) .

However, the nature of the sympathetic-immune interaction requires further clarification because ocular application of the \u03b2-blocker, timolol, to humans and sympathetic denervation in rats (Sullivan et al., 1990a) had no apparent effect on tear IgA content.

In support of this hypothesis, VIP and adrenergic agents are known to enhance the generation of cellular cAMP (Mauduit et al., 1984; Dartt, 1989 Dartt, , 1992 .

In humans, parasympathetic agents stimulate the secretion of EGF and TGF-\u03b21 from the lacrimal gland (Yoshino et al., 1996a,b) , whereas in birds, carbachol, by apparently binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on IgG plasma cells, increases IgG output from the Harderian gland (Brink et al., 1994; Cameron et al., 1995) . In contrast, carbamylcholine (carbachol) acutely (i.e., hours) enhances, but chronically (i.e., days) decreases, basal-, cholera-toxin-, and androgen-induced SC production by rat lacrimal gland acinar epithelial cells Lambert et al., 1994) . The transient effect of this compound may be mediated through the mobilization of intracellular calcium, the activation of protein kinase C, and the rapid enhancement of cellular secretion (Dartt, 1989; Lambert et al., 1994) . The processes underlying the long-term inhibitory action of carbachol, which may be prevented by atropine, is unknown, but it may involve the suppression of cAMP (Jumblatt et al., 1990) or an alteration of gene activity (Lambert et al., 1994) . The mucosal immune system of the eye may also be regulated by cytokines. For example, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-6 or IFN\u03b3, stimulate the acinar cell synthesis and secretion of SC . The regulatory effect of TNF-\u03b1 on acinar cell SC is similar to that found in colonic cell lines, in which TNF-\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, and IL-1 increase the production, surface expression, and release of SC (Kvale et al., 1988) . However, the absence of IFN\u03b3 activity on SC output by acinar cells is notable in that this cytokine regulates SC dynamics in intestinal (Sollid et al., 1987; Kvale et al., 1988; Nilsen et al., 1999; Blanch et al., 1999) and uterine (Wira and Prabhala, 1993) epithelial cells and may influence lacrimal gland acinar cell secretion (Lambert, 1998) . Although IL-6 appears to have no influence on lacrimal SC production , IL-6 and IL-5 stimulate the synthesis of IgA in lacrimal tissue explants (Pockley and Montgomery, 1990b) and in combination augment the secondary tear IgA antibody response to pneumococcal antigen (Pockley and Montgomery, 1991) and suppress IgG and IgM synthesis in lacrimal tissue (Pockley and Montgomery, 1990a) . Likewise, TGF-\u03b2 enhances IgA output from rat lacrimal tissue, whether alone or in combination with IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, or IL-5 plus IL-6 (Rafferty and .
