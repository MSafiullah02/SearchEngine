            "text": "Ionophores and antibiotics are extensively used to increase animal performance by modifying ruminal bacterial populations to obtain more efficient fermentation. However, the use of antibiotics in animal agriculture is perceived by some to be a major public health concern because antibiotics are thought to contribute to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (Salyers, 2002). As an alternative to antibiotics, direct-fed microbial agents have been tested to enhance animal performance, but their effectiveness is inconsistent (Ghorbani et al., 2002; Brashears et al., 2003; Elam et al., 2003). The use of naturally occurring microbial or plant extracts has also been postulated to improve animal productivity, but further development is needed to obtain efficacious natural feed additives (Newbold et al., 2001).",

            "text": "An alternative to feeding ionophores or direct-fed microbial agents that has not received as much attention until recently is immunization. Vaccination against ruminal Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus spp. led to reductions in ruminal lactate concentration and target bacteria (Shu et al., 1999). Similarly, passive immunization achieved by feeding colostrum or eggs successfully prevented bovine coronavirus diarrhea (Ikemori et al., 1997) in bottle-fed calves. Feeding avian antibodies is a possible alternative because immunoglobulin Y, the main source of immunoglobulins in avian antibodies, is resistant to heat, acid digestion, and proteolysis (Shimizu et al., 1988). Polyclonal antibody preparations (PAP) against various microorganisms are produced by Camas Inc. (LeCenter, MN), but they have not been tested for their ability to affect target bacteria. An objective of the present series of studies was to evaluate effects of feeding avian-derived PAP against S. bovis or Fusobacterium necrophorum on ruminal populations of target bacteria and ruminal pH of steers fed a high-grain diet supplemented or not with feed additives (MT, monensin and tylosin). A second objective (Exp. 2) was to evaluate effects of PAP and time postfeeding on ruminal populations of target bacteria and ruminal pH of steers fed a high-grain diet supplemented or not with MT.",

These organisms were used for the initial testing, to which wild-type organisms isolated from the rumen of normal cattle were later added. More than 600 hens were immunized per each immunogen.

Eggs were collected for 3 d, and the product was made from eggs pooled from this collection. The PAP product was made using a mixture of egg protein, molasses, soy oil, and PBS at pH 7.4. At the single dose, the PAP product was fed at 2.5 mL/d. Approximately 2 mL of the egg protein was present in each 2.5-mL aliquot of the PAP product. Titers by ELISA averaged between 1:50,000 and 1:1,000,000. The preparations contained immunoglobulin Y, immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin A. Counts of 1018 antibody molecules per mL of egg protein were observed. This included approximately 10 to 20% of the preparation that was not active. Because antibodies against many bacteria are found in most eggs, commercially available egg products or eggs were tested for antibodies to specific microbes using the same protocols used to produce egg protein. Although there were small amounts of antibodies in these products and eggs to specific bacteria such as Streptococcus spp. or Escherichia coli, they did not bind specific organisms to beads coated with these antibodies. In addition, the ELISA titers did not indicate binding to the specific attachment factors.",

Samples of feed ingredients, including pellets, were collected weekly, and those of feed refusals were collected daily.

Selectiveness of modified lactate medium is based on the presence of lactate as the only carbon source and the presence of 3 antibiotics (bacitracin, gentamycin sulfate, and streptomycin sulfate). Wells that demonstrated bacterial growth were tested for the presumptive presence of F. necrophorum by adding a drop of Kovac's reagent. If indole production was observed, well contents were streaked on brain heart infusion agar plates and incubated anaerobically at 39 \u00b0 C for 24 h. Counts of F. necrophorum per milliliter of ruminal fluid were determined by the MPN technique based on triplicate 10-fold dilutions. Isolates were confirmed as F. necrophorum using API 20A strips (bioMerieux, Inc.).",

Our results indicated (Exp. 1 and 2) that PAP-Sb was effective in reducing counts of target bacteria in the rumen when fed at the 1 \u00d7 or 3 \u00d7 dose. The cubic response by S. bovis counts to PAP-Sb was due to the fact that the 2 \u00d7 dose (5 mL of PAP-Sb/d) had no effect on ruminal S. bovis counts. It is not clear why the 2 \u00d7 dose did not affect ruminal S. bovis counts, but it could be due to a phenomenon of antibody-to-antibody agglutination at greater antibody titers. This theory, however, would not explain why feeding the 3 \u00d7 dose did reduce ruminal S. bovis counts. It is possible that feeding the 3 \u00d7 dose yielded sufficiently greater antibody binding sites to overcome antibody-to-antibody agglutination. We have also observed this effect with the 2 \u00d7 dose in a separate experiment (DiLorenzo et al., 2005).",

Reductions in ruminal S. bovis counts of 99% were reported for steers vaccinated (i.m.) against S. bovis 16 h after an abrupt change from a forage diet to a high-grain diet (Shu et al., 1999). Differences observed in the magnitude of response by ruminal S. bovis counts between the study conducted by Shu et al. (1999) and our study are probably due to substantial differences in methodology approaches. Feeding PAP-Sb is considered a passive immunization method, because antibodies against S. bovis are produced by immunized hens and then fed to steers. The immunization method followed by Shu et al. (1999) led to active immunization, because steers were exposed to the antigen and adjuvant to develop their own immune response (Ghaffar, 2004).",

Lower ruminal S. bovis counts in Exp. 2 as well as lack of differences in ruminal S. bovis between 0 and 5.5 h postfeeding in Exp. 2 could be because counts of S. bovis in the rumens of animals adapted to high-grain diets do not tend to deviate much from 107/mL of ruminal fluid (Dehority, 2003). Because Exp. 1 was conducted for 14 d after adaptation to eating high-grain diets and Exp. 2 was conducted for 29 d after adaptation, a longer period of exposure of steers in Exp. 2 to the high-grain diet may have led to differences in ruminal S. bovis counts and their magnitude of response to feeding PAP-Sb between the 2 experiments. Other studies revealed no differences in counts of starch-utilizing bacteria in the rumen of steers fed high-grain diets between 0 and 12 h postfeeding after a 12-d adaptation period (Leedle et al., 1982).",

            "text": "In contrast to previous observations by several authors (Dennis et al., 1981; Nagaraja et al., 1981; Coe et al., 1999), feeding a supplement formulated to deliver 300 mg of monensin/d and 90 mg of tylosin/d did not affect the population of ruminal S. bovis in Exp. 1. A reduction of 60% in ruminal S. bovis concentrations was reported when 250 mg of monensin/d plus 90 mg of tylosin/d were fed to steers on a high-grain diet (Coe et al., 1999). We also observed a 67% reduction in S. bovis counts due to PAP-Sb feeding compared with steers fed no PAP-Sb; however, no effects on S. bovis were observed due to MT feeding during Exp. 2. Although some of these differences may be attributable to the size and breed of experimental animals (Coe et al., 1999 used 288- to 318-kg Holstein steers), differences may be due to response to monensin by S. bovis strains. Dennis et al. (1981) conducted an extensive study to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of monensin needed to impair the growth of most lactate-producing bacteria of the rumen. Interestingly, 2 of the 3 strains of S. bovis tested were sensitive to monensin, indicating some of the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations of all species and strains tested. However, the third strain tested (S. bovis 124) was resistant to monensin at the concentrations tested (48 \u03bcg/mL of medium). This resistant strain of S. bovis is considered one of the exemptions to the general belief that monensin inhibits gram-positive bacteria (Westley, 1977; Nagaraja et al., 1981). Dawson and Boling (1983) indicated that monensin-resistant bacteria might be found in greater numbers in rumens of animals fed monensin-supplemented diets than those not fed monensin. However, this phenomenon was not necessarily associated with altered fermentation patterns. It is possible that differences in S. bovis response to MT feeding in our experiments was caused by differential response of S. bovis strains to continuous monensin feeding.",

The complexity of the ruminal microbial ecosystem is such that, in general, when groups or species of microorganisms are decreased in numbers, other groups or species develop because of substrate availability; a relatively constant number of total bacteria for a given diet is thus maintained. Variations in ruminal bacterial counts are expected, however, with different diets, levels of intake, and postprandial sampling times (Leedle et al., 1982; Dehority and Orpin, 1988). Products that affect total anaerobic bacterial counts are not commonly used in production agriculture. Day-to-day stability in total anaerobic bacteria numbers was documented previously (Leedle et al., 1982). Maintaining total anaerobic bacteria at similar numbers as those found in control steers is a reflection of the innocuous effect of feeding MT or PAP-Sb on total anaerobic bacterial counts.",
