DC\u2010SIGN contains a CRD that is highly conserved in lectins and a neck region consisting of Ig\u2010like domain repetitions, which mediate a pH\u2010dependent oligomerization of DC\u2010SIGN monomers and thus, increase affinity with its ligands [5, \u2013, 7, 8]. During monocyte differentiation toward MoDCs, DC\u2010SIGN expression has also been reported to be induced by IL\u20104 and to be negatively regulated by IFNs, TGF\u2010\u03b2, and dexamethasone [9].",

[13]). Interactions between DC\u2010SIGN and pathogenic\u2010derived sugar moieties have been shown to play a prominent role in vivo in favoring the capture and internalization of microbes [14], with or without the help of other Ag\u2010capture receptors, such as the macrophage mannose receptor (CD206), DEC\u2010205 (CD205) [15], or the macrophage galactose\u2010type C\u2010type lectin [16]. In contrast to other C\u2010type lectins, several transcripts have been described for DC\u2010SIGN, most likely originating from alternative splicing and potentially leading to the expression of sDC\u2010SIGN proteins [17]. As described already for the DC\u2010SIGN homologue, DC\u2010SIGNR (or CD209 ligand) [18], such cDNAs have been reported by others to encode nonsecreted sDC\u2010SIGN molecules [19]. In addition, the same study showed that sDC\u2010SIGN displayed no functional activity in terms of ICAM\u20103\u2010dependent cosignaling compared with mDC\u2010SIGN.",

            "text": "Some years ago, we demonstrated that CMV, like HIV, is able to bind to DCs via DC\u2010SIGN and enter them more easily than the free viral particles [20]. Consequently, the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated increase in virus entry resulted in a strong CMV infection of MoDC. The study in question shed new light on the molecular interactions that favor DC infection by CMV and especially the pivotal role played by DC\u2010SIGN as a docking and internalizing receptor. CMV is a widespread herpesvirus that infects 40\u2013100% of the populations worldwide. It induces lifelong viral persistence and may cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV or transplant patients. The major CMV host entry sites are myeloid DC\u2010containing peripheral tissues, especially oropharyngeal and genital mucosa. In the present study, we investigated expression regulation and functional properties of naturally occurring as well as rsDC\u2010SIGN variants. We demonstrated that such variants can promote CMV infection of MoDCs, as already shown for their counterparts, mDC\u2010SIGN. These data suggest that sDC\u2010SIGN variants may play a crucial role in the CMV\u2010mediated pathogenesis.",

            "text": "A previous study by Mummidi and colleagues [17] reported the cloning of cDNA, potentially coding for sDC\u2010SIGN. To determine whether corresponding proteins exist, we first isolated DC\u2010SIGN\u2010encoding cDNAs from monocyte\u2010 or CD34+ cord blood cell\u2010derived DCs by PCR. The primer used in this PCR allowed for the insertion of a FLAG tag\u2010encoding sequence in the 5\u2032 position (\nFig. 1\n\nA). Only 10 selected cDNA clones were submitted to a second round of PCR to retain the sole TM region lacking cDNAs, thought to probably code for sDC\u2010SIGN (Fig. 1B). Four of the 10 clones were not amplified by the TM\u2010specific internal PCR (Clones 2, 3, 6, and 7; Fig. 1A and B). These cDNA clones lacking the TM exon were sequenced and blasted against known cDNA libraries. Then, we confirmed that three out of these four isolated cDNAs were completely identical to a sequence reported previously by Mummidi et al. [17] (i.e., sDC\u2010SIGN1A type I isoform\u2010encoding sequence; GenBank Accession Number NM_001144896) and that the last one encoded a spliced variant, the sDC\u2010SIGN1A type III (GenBank Accession Number AY042227). We then subcloned sDC\u2010SIGN1A type I\u2010 and III\u2010encoding cDNAs (called thereafter FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 and T3) into prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression plasmids as required. An ELISA was produced simultaneously to measure sDC\u2010SIGN isoform concentrations in cell culture supernatants or in any other biological fluids. The FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 protein of prokaryotic origin was used to obtain a standard curve and set up our homemade ELISA (Fig. 1C). Although our sDC\u2010SIGN ELISA was moderately sensitive with a typical concentration range of 100\u20130.1 ng/ml, we were able to validate its specificity. In fact, by means of selective IP experiments on sDC\u2010SIGN standard solutions, we could demonstrate that 1B10 mAb or H\u2010200 pAb (the coating pAb), directed against DC\u2010SIGN, abrogated sDC\u2010SIGN detection, whereas an irrelevant mAb had no effect, i.e., FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 was still detected by ELISA (Table 1). Interestingly, a homotypic ELISA, i.e., the same antibody (clone 3E1) used as the primary (capture) and secondary antibody, led to low signal detection. This observation evoked the possibility that the FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 protein was expressed as multimers. This issue is addressed at a later stage in this paper.",

It was our hypothesis that the lack of secreted proteins in culture supernatants may be a result of a secretion defect or the lack of a signal peptide [25]. Of note, certain proteins, such as IL\u20101\u03b1, FGF2, or galectin\u20101/3, are secreted, despite being devoid of a signal peptide [26, \u2013, 28, 29]. As a result, we surmised that the same could be true for sDC\u2010SIGN. Thus, using our quantitative and specific ELISA, we observed the presence of potential sDC\u2010SIGN isoforms in 10\u00d7 concentrated cell culture supernatants of mDC\u2010SIGN\u2010expressing DCs. In vitro DCs were generated from adult monocytes or CD34+ CBPs, according to already well\u2010known protocols [17, 23, 30]. Somewhat surprisingly, increasing quantities of sDC\u2010SIGN were found in both DC\u2010derived culture supernatants in relation to postdifferentiation time (\nFig. 2\n\nA and B). sDC\u2010SIGN appearance in culture supernatants was correlated with the addition of rIL\u20104. This observation was consistent with previously published observations showing that upon differentiation, IL\u20104 was required to induce mDC\u2010SIGN expression [9]. To know whether sDC\u2010SIGN and mDC\u2010SIGN expressions could be differentially regulated during differentiation, MoDCs were generated with several cytokine cocktails (IL\u20104/GM\u2010CSF, IFN\u2010\u03b1/GM\u2010CSF, and IL\u201013/GM\u2010CSF) or IL\u20104/IL\u201013 alone. All combinations, except the one using IFN\u2010\u03b1, were able to induce sDC\u2010SIGN and mDC\u2010SIGN to the same extent, as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 2C and D). Taken together, these results provided strong evidence that sDC\u2010SIGN may be secreted by in vitro\u2010generated DCs and that sDC\u2010SIGN and mDC\u2010SIGN were regulated in a similar manner in the course of DC differentiation.",

To circumvent these difficulties, we alternatively treated MoDCs with a broad\u2010spectrum inhibitor of MMPs (i.e., a disintegrin and metalloprotease/TACE family), called Marimastat (British Biotech, UK), which was supposed to have no effect on sDC\u2010SIGN release. Differentiating DCs were incubated with increasing doses of Marimastat. At Day 6, mDC\u2010SIGN expression was analyzed by flow cytometry, and sDC\u2010SIGN was quantified in culture supernatants by ELISA (\nFig. 3\n\nA, respectively, black and open bars). Despite the use of high concentrations of Marimastat (10 \u03bcM), no modification of sDC\u2010SIGN versus mDC\u2010SIGN expression patterns could be observed, thus weighing in favor of a sliced, sequence\u2010derived product and not a shedding of mDC\u2010SIGN by MMPs.",

            "text": "Several groups have provided strong evidence that mDC\u2010SIGN or its homologue DC\u2010SIGNR is expressed as homotetramers to increase affinity for their ligands [5, 7, 31]. Tetramerization is dependent on the neck length consisting of various Ig\u2010like domain repeats [5, 32] and also on the extracellular pH [8]. The question we posed ourselves was whether this was the case for sDC\u2010SIGN using gel filtration. Here again, we were unable to purify sufficient sDC\u2010SIGN from MoDC cultures to perform our analysis. As a result, we produced rFLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 and T3 in E. coli and separated them according to their apparent MW by gel filtration. For each sample, fractions were collected and analyzed by ELISA. The results are shown in Fig. 3C. sDC\u2010SIGN quantities were plotted against elution volumes, and elution volume of the maximum sDC\u2010SIGN quantities for each sample was determined on the plot. Column precalibration allowed us to calculate each apparent MWmeas of the most abundant sDC\u2010SIGN isoform found in each sample. Thus, the FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1\u2010associated peak was eluted with 52 ml, corresponding to an apparent MW of 175 kD. An approximate, MWtheor of 46 kD was calculated on specialized websites (MWtheor; http://www.expasy.org/) for FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1. As MWmeas was about four times larger than MWtheor (ratio=3.8), we concluded that FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 could be expressed as tetramers in nondenaturing and nonreducing conditions. Applying the same procedure for the FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT3, it was estimated that unlike sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1, sDC\u2010SIGN1AT3 could probably be found in culture medium as a dimer (MWmeas=81 kD; MWtheor=32 kD; ratio=2.5). Purified CRD (\u223c19 kD) was used as a control here, as it was unable to multimerize. Peak\u2010associated fractions of the FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 gel filtration run were pooled and concentrated ten\u2010 to 15\u2010fold onto centrifugal filter units (10 kDa cutoff) and finally analyzed by Western blotting in denaturing and reducing conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 3D. In this setting, we only observed FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 as a 40\u2010 to 45\u2010kDa protein, suggesting that FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 is expressed as a homotetramer in native conditions. All of our data indicate that sDC\u2010SIGN proteins are secreted in a MMP\u2010independent manner as exosome\u2010free homotetramers, at least for full\u2010length sDC\u2010SIGN variants.",

Thus, we assumed that it could be secreted by DCs in vivo. Our study first analyzed human sera from healthy donors by Western blot (n=21; \nFig. 4\n\nA). Much to our surprise, sDC\u2010SIGN was detected in 19 of the 21 sera with a heterogeneity of expression between individuals. Following this, we tested a broader panel of human serum from healthy donors (n=62) by ELISA. Consistently with the Western blot analysis, almost all sera contained detectable amounts of sDC\u2010SIGN ranging from 0 to >150 ng/ml with a mean value of 65.36 ng/ml (min=0 ng/ml; max=154 ng/ml; median=72 ng/ml; 25th percentile=32.41 ng/ml; 75th percentile=95.75 ng/ml; Fig. 4B). The serum sDC\u2010SIGN concentrations were comparable with the lower amounts of MBL variants, which are found in human serum in a broad range of concentrations, depending on their genotype [33]. Further gel\u2010filtration experiments demonstrated that serum sDC\u2010SIGN was more probably expressed as tetramers, which was consistent with our previous results obtained with rFLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 (Supplemental Fig. 1). mDC\u2010SIGN has previously been associated with Th2 responses, at least in vitro [34, 35]. However, certain experimental findings came to our attention, showing that DC\u2010SIGN may be up\u2010regulated in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn\u02c8s disease [36, 37]. We hypothesized that sDC\u2010SIGN may be found in inflammatory body fluids. For this purpose, BALs were harvested from patients suffering from diverse lung diseases, including primary CMV infections, and tested for the presence of sDC\u2010SIGN. When segregated according to the inflammatory status of samples (based on diagnoses, i.e., viral infections, etc.), the quantity of sDC\u2010SIGN was clearly higher within inflammatory (mean=24.4 ng/ml) compared with noninflammatory BAL (mean=1.37 ng/ml; P=0.0005; Fig. 4C). To confirm these observations, we compared sera and joint fluids from RA versus osteoarthritis\u2010suffering patients. Joint fluids from RA patients were indeed prototypical inflammatory fluids, whereas joint fluids from osteoarthritis were considered as mechanical fluids marked by the absence of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Supplemental Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 4D (left panel), there was a highly significant difference between sDC\u2010SIGN amounts in RA versus control joint fluids (P=0.006). When analyzing the related sDC\u2010SIGN concentrations in the sera of the same patients (Fig. 4D, right panel; P=0.02), a similar difference could be observed, thus promoting the conclusion that sDC\u2010SIGN expression was closely correlated to the inflammatory status of these human biological fluids (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results largely confirmed the fact that sDC\u2010SIGN is produced in distinct biological fluids, and its expression appears to be up\u2010regulated by inflammatory disorders, as exemplified here in the case of RA.",

We therefore infected freshly isolated mucosal explants of human origin (vagina or cervix biopsies) with a high viral load and further incubated them for 7 days before freezing. Frozen tissue sections were stained to reveal nuclear IE/E CMV Ag in infected cells or DC\u2010SIGN. As shown in \nFig. 5\n\nA, DC\u2010SIGN+ cells were located exclusively in the lamina propria (Fig. 5A, d and e) of freshly isolated explants (Fig. 5A, a) or of 7\u2010day noninfected explants (Fig. 5A, b), whereas after a 7\u2010day infection period, DC\u2010SIGN+ cells were distributed equally among the mucosal epithelium and the lamina propria (Fig. 5A, f), as shown by a sharp nuclear staining of IE/E CMV Ag\u2010positive cells (Fig. 5A, c). In the course of these experiments, explant culture supernatants were collected and analyzed by ELISA to quantify secreted DC\u2010SIGN. The results are described in Fig. 5B.

We then confirmed that CMV infection contributed to the establishment of an inflammatory environment by showing that typical cytokines (IL\u20106 and IFN\u2010\u03b3) or chemokines (CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108 and CXCL\u201010/IP\u201010) were overproduced in explant supernatants upon infection (Fig. 5C). LPS stimulation for 24 h was used as a positive control of cytokine/chemokine release. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that sDC\u2010SIGN expression could be up\u2010regulated by a viral infection of freshly isolated peripheral tissues.",

Focusing on molecules overexpressed in explant culture supernatants upon CMV infection or LPS activation, experiments were performed using fully differentiated immature MoDC, subcultured with various doses of human rCXCL\u20108/IL\u20108, rCXCL\u201010/IP\u201010, rIFN\u2010\u03b3, and rIL\u20106, alone or in combination. To minimize the effect of exogenous IL\u20104, which is necessary to differentiate MoDC but also able to induce sDC\u2010SIGN, potentially leading to misleading conclusions, cells were first starved of IL\u20104. In that setting, sDC\u2010SIGN release was up\u2010regulated significantly by IFN\u2010\u03b3 and to a lesser extent, by CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108 in a dose\u2010dependent manner when compared with the spontaneous level of sDC\u2010SIGN secretion by IL\u20104\u2010starved cells (i.e., \u201cno IL\u20104\u201d experimental conditions; respectively, P=0.01 and P=0.001), whereas no significant effect could be shown after adding exogenous CXCL\u20101/IP\u201010 or IL\u20106 (\nFig. 6\n). It should be noted that CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 act in an additive but not synergistic manner to induce sDC\u2010SIGN production by IL\u20104\u2010starved immature MoDCs. The stimulation level in that case is equivalent to the \u201cIL\u20104 alone\u201d experimental condition. IL\u20106 unresponsiveness is most likely a result of the absence of a functional receptor on the cell surface, as no significant staining for gp130, i.e., the signal\u2010transducing chain of IL\u20106R, could be observed by flow cytometry (data not shown). In accordance with our previous data, we hereby demonstrated that sDC\u2010SIGN is re\u2010induced by exogenous IFN\u2010\u03b3 and/or CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108 in fully differentiated immature MoDC cultures.",

            "text": "We demonstrated above that sDC\u2010SIGN secretion is promoted by an inflammatory setting and even upon CMV infection of human tissue explants. Thus, it remained to be determined whether sDC\u2010SIGN has a protective or facilitating effect on CMV infection. First, we tested the functionality of FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 through its ability to interact directly with the CMV envelope gB, which we identified previously as a ligand for mDC\u2010SIGN [20]. Lysates of transiently transfected HEK cells were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated further with FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 or specific mAb as a detection control to document interactions between gB and sDC\u2010SIGN under native conditions (\nFig. 7\n\nA). When incubated with FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1, gB+ cell lysates could be revealed by a HRP\u2010conjugated anti\u2010FLAG antibody, whereas the anti\u2010FLAG alone did not provide any signal. FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1+ HEK cell lysates were used as positive controls for DC\u2010SIGN and FLAG detection. An additional actin detection was used as a loading sample control. These results suggested that the FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 was functional. However, the functional role of sDC\u2010SIGN during the CMV infection remained unclear. On the basis of the MBL\u2010mediated inhibition of HIV susceptibility reported in the literature, we first hypothesized that sDC\u2010SIGN might neutralize the CMV infection of MoDC. In this setting, we were unable to block MoDC infection, even using higher concentrations of FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 (data not shown). In addition, as mDC\u2010SIGN expression was reported to be responsible for MoDC CMV cis\u2010infection, we assumed that FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 may function as a promoter of the infection. For this purpose, MoDC were infected with TBGFP CMV (MOI=1) for 24\u201348 h in the presence of decreasing amounts of FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 (from 400 to 12.5 ng/ml). The GFP+ MoDC, indicating the percentage of early infected cells, was estimated by flow cytometry. Infected MoDC frequencies were approximately twice as high (33.1\u00b16%) as the control infection (14.8\u00b17.2%) when incubated with 50 ng/ml FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1\u2010supplemented culture medium (P=0.01; Fig. 7B). A 100\u2010ng/ml concentration was not sufficient to mediate a significant infection enhancement when compared with control infection. Surprisingly, it was observed that FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 concentrations higher than 100 ng/ml and lower than 50 ng/ml did not modify the infectious rate of MoDC. To confirm that the deleterious effect that we could observe was specific to sDC\u2010SIGN, we conducted similar experiments but only using an optimal amount of FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 (50 ng/ml), which was first captured or not onto a mannan\u2010conjugated resin (Fig. 7C, upper panels). Here again, the addition of FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 doubled the GFP+ MoDC percentage (32.5% vs. 15.7%). This enhanced infection was readily a result of FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN, as it was abrogated by a preincubation step of the recombinant lectin on mannan\u2010conjugated agarose. As a negative control, we also performed the same assay with FSF, which we reported previously as being prone to CMV infection in a DC\u2010SIGN\u2010independent manner ([20]; Fig. 7C lower panels). All of these results led us to conclude that FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 is functional and is able to facilitate CMV infection of MoDCs.",

[17], we cloned cDNAs lacking the TM\u2010encoding exon and coding for putative sDC\u2010SIGN from distinct, in vitro\u2010generated DC populations. In our study, a broad\u2010spectrum inhibitor of MMPs was used to avoid a possible shedding of mDC\u2010SIGN at the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, MoDC and tissue\u2010residing DCs expressed two or three other membrane\u2010associated MMPs that might not be targeted by MMP inhibitors [38]. However, MMP inhibition did not result in a difference of sDC\u2010SIGN and mDC\u2010SIGN expression by MoDCs. These results all confirmed previous observations reporting sDC\u2010SIGN expression as a soluble, full\u2010length molecule. Another crucial issue was to check whether sDC\u2010SIGN could be expressed as an exosome\u2010associated protein, as suggested in a recent report [39]. Briefly, exosomes derived from DC\u2010SIGN+ murine bone marrow\u2010derived DCs were shown to express DC\u2010SIGN on the basis of cytometric analyses. On the other hand, as a result of very slight DC\u2010SIGN staining of exosomes, these results were not convincing and had to be interpreted with caution. In this case, based on the measurement of sDC\u2010SIGN concentrations with our ELISA, we could undoubtedly argue in favor of the expression of sDC\u2010SIGN as exosome\u2010free molecules. The final proof of the secretion of a full\u2010length sDC\u2010SIGN would be to sequence the naturally occurring sDC\u2010SIGN protein, but we failed to purify sufficient amounts of it to obtain any kind of irrefutable proof.",

Another study also provided sound evidence that immature MoDCs express mDC\u2010SIGN tetramers, which are supposed to physically interact with the coreceptor CD4 [40]. Here, by gel filtration analyses under native conditions (i.e., neutral pH and isotonic buffer), we proved that not only recombinant but also blood\u2010borne sDC\u2010SIGN consisted of tetramers, thus confirming results published previously by others [5, 8].",

These results were in line with those published by Relloso and colleagues [9] in a previous report. In addition, we did not test IFN\u2010\u03b3 during monocyte differentiation in DCs, but we tested IFN\u2010\u03b1, which was sufficient to prevent DC\u2010SIGN expression when added at the very beginning of MoDC differentiation. In contrast, it had no effect when added after 2 days postdifferentiation (data not shown), strongly suggesting that DC\u2010SIGN expression was irreversible. This idea was borne out by a former study reporting the IL\u20104\u2010dependent and irreversible up\u2010regulation of PU.1, a specific transcription factor of the myeloid lineage, mainly responsible for the induction of DC\u2010SIGN expression in MoDCs and monocyte\u2010derived macrophages during their in vitro differentiation [41, 42]. In this study, besides IL\u20104 or IL\u201013, we used fully differentiated immature MoDCs as a cellular model to document what inflammatory soluble factors could be involved in the sDC\u2010SIGN secretion that we detected in several human body fluids. Surprisingly, IFN\u2010\u03b1 and most probably, type I IFNs, in general (although this remains to be experimentally ascertained), were shown to impair DC\u2010SIGN during cell differentiation, whereas IFN\u2010\u03b3 was identified as a good inducer of sDC\u2010SIGN by fully differentiated immature MoDC. CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108 was also demonstrated to promote sDC\u2010SIGN expression but to a lesser extent. When added together as exogenous cytokines on IL\u20104\u2010starved MoDCs, we observed additive effects on sDC\u2010SIGN secretion, suggesting that they may be both required to induce optimal sDC\u2010SIGN secretion, albeit weakly. Even at higher doses of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and/or CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108, we were unable to attain the sDC\u2010SIGN secretion level obtained with IL\u20104 or IL\u201013 in vitro. To explain why, in such a case, IFN\u2010\u03b3 induced and did not repress sDC\u2010SIGN secretion by MoDCs, one could argue once again that fully differentiated immature MoDCs have a distinct transcription program coordinated by distinct transcription factors (i.e., PU.1, etc.) compared with monocytes during their differentiation.",

The analysis of the cytokine content of infected biopsy supernatants confirmed the presence of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108 in sufficient amounts to imagine their direct involvement in the induction of sDC\u2010SIGN. In these experiments, no difference of mDC\u2010SIGN expression by dermal DCs could be observed by immunostaining. Based on our own results, we expected that sDC\u2010SIGN induction could be correlated with the same up\u2010regulation of membrane isoforms. However, it is our belief that the explanation for this discrepancy can be found in a recent study reported by Liu et al. [18], indicating that the vast majority of DC\u2010SIGNR, a closely related DC\u2010SIGN gene product found in HIV mucosal inoculation sites, i.e., anal and genital mucosa, was encoded by TM lacking spliced cDNA sequences [17]. These data pointed to a differential expression of sDC\u2010SIGN versus mDC\u2010SIGNR isoforms in virally infected peripheral tissues. Despite being unable to document any differential expression of DC\u2010SIGN in vitro, we cannot rule out this possibility in vivo. To better understand if this were the case, discriminating antibodies are currently being generated in our laboratory. Interestingly, former studies provided strong evidence that RA synovia contained high levels of CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108, which may be a result of viral infection caused by CMV [43]. Here, these molecules were detected in high amounts in infected BAL or RA joint fluids, suggesting that they could also be sDC\u2010SIGN inducers in vivo. Moreover, CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108 was up\u2010regulated in the female genital tract in the course of coinfection with CMV and HIV\u20101 [44]. This observation substantially supported our sDC\u2010SIGN induction data in genital mucosa explants. CXCL\u20108/IL\u20108 was already known as an efficient neutrophil and macrophage chemoattractant, and a link had been established between high serum concentrations and the CMV disease occurrence in patients after liver allotransplantation [45].",

Unfortunately, we were unable to show significant correlation (data not shown). In contrast, we demonstrated that high amounts of sDC\u2010SIGN could be correlated to high amounts of cytokines and chemokines, usually overexpressed upon inflammation in diverse body fluids, such as serum, BAL, or joint fluids, from patients suffering from autoimmune, inflammatory, or infectious diseases. These results match the data reporting an increased number of mDC\u2010SIGN\u2010expressing macrophages in BAL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis\u2010infected patients [3], as well as in RA synovia [4]. Several studies have already reported a link between high frequencies of mDC\u2010SIGN+\u2010infiltrating cells and the proinflammatory environment found in Crohn\u02c8s disease lesions [37].

[47] reported convincing data, they used truncated rsDC\u2010SIGN, only consisting of the DC\u2010SIGN CRD domain, which was shown to be expressed as monomers in solution by others [5]. CRD monomers had a limited affinity for their ligands in comparison with tetramers [40]. Here, we provided strong evidence that FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 was capable of interacting with the CMV gB, already known to be a ligand of mDC\u2010SIGN [20]. Using our tetrameric rsDC\u2010SIGN, we were unable to inhibit CMV infection of FSF, even when sizeable sDC\u2010SIGN amounts were used (up to 17 \u03bcM; data not shown). We then hypothesized that sDC\u2010SIGN could function as an enhancer of CMV infection. As expected, low FLAG\u2010sDC\u2010SIGN1AT1 concentrations (varying from 10 to 100 ng/ml) allowed a significant increase in the percentage of IE/E CMV Ag+ immature MoDC from three distinct blood donors, whereas sDC\u2010SIGN concentrations below and above this range had no potentializing effect. To explain this bell\u2010curve effect, we proposed a hypothetical model at low but constant viral input. According to this model, at high sDC\u2010SIGN concentrations, free virions are rapidly complexed, leading to an impaired binding and internalization of CMV into MoDC. Between 100 and 10 ng/ml, sDC\u2010SIGN may serve as an opsonin with CMV virions with an optimal stoichiometry leading to the capture and internalization of a maximum number of sDC\u2010SIGN\u2010immobilized virions. When using very low sDC\u2010SIGN concentrations (below 10 ng/ml), the majority of virus is free, and the infection efficacy decreases to levels of infection without sDC\u2010SIGN, as we postulated that sDC\u2010SIGN\u2010opsonized CMV was captured more efficiently by MoDC than free virions. This suggests the existence of one or several yet\u2010unknown opsonic receptors for sDC\u2010SIGN, which may not be able to interact with previously reported, truncated rsDC\u2010SIGN [5, 46]. A novel study is under progress in our lab to fulfil the identification of such a receptor. However, based on the literature, we discuss putative candidates. First, ICAM\u20102 and \u20103, but not ICAM\u20101, are ligands for mDC\u2010SIGN [10, 11]. However, only ICAM\u20101 is expressed by MoDC [48]. Although we cannot rule out, so far, the possibility for sDC\u2010SIGN to interact with ICAM\u20101, the involvement of ICAM\u20102/3 in the sDC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated infection enhancement in MoDC is likely to be inconceivable. Second, mDC\u2010SIGN complexes have the propensity to form multimers (di\u2010, tri\u2010, and tetramers, depending on the neck length [7]). As a consequence, one can imagine that sDC\u2010SIGN, whether bound to CMV virions or not, may be able to dock on mDC\u2010SIGN to form aggregates with pre\u2010existing lectin homodimers or trimers. New experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis. We finally considered a last potential candidate receptor enabling the sDC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated CMV infection enhancement, the CD11b molecule, also known as the \u03b1M integrin, a macrophage antigen\u20101 or complement receptor 3 component when associated with the \u03b12 integrin. CD11b is highly expressed by immature MoDC [49]. Interestingly, it has been involved recently in the uptake of mannosylated liposomes by macrophages in cooperation with a murine homologue of mDC\u2010SIGN [50]. Furthermore, CD11b has also been described to function as a facilitating agent for HIV opsonization by immature MoDC in a mDC\u2010SIGN\u2010dependent manner [49]. It is thus highly tempting to speculate on the fact that sDC\u2010SIGN\u2010opsonized CMV particles may interact directly with CD11b, leading to their internalization and thus, promoting MoDC infection. Further experiments are obviously needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

As such, our findings shed new light on the diversity of the DC\u2010SIGN repertoire and extend our knowledge of the use of mDC\u2010SIGN as well as sDC\u2010SIGN by CMV to divert the human innate immune response to its own benefit.",
