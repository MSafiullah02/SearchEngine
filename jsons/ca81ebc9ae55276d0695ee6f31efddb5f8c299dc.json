VPA is a drug primarily used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, as well as migraine. 1 Chemically VPA is a weak organic acid that was first synthesized in 1882 as an analog of valeric acid, found naturally in the plant valeriana officinalis. 1,2 VPA was tested initially as a solvent of organic compounds, and latter found serendipitously to be active in animals and humans as an anticonvulsant in 1962. 3 It is a carboxylic acid clear liquid at room temperature. VPA was first approved in France (1967) for use in humans as an anti-epileptic medication. 1 VPA attenuates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in preclinical models [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and in humans 10,11 especially during the acute treatment phase, although conflicting results have been reported. 12 This molecule has also shown intrinsic antiviral activity probably due to its activity as histone deacetylase inhibitor. 9,13-16 VPA has shown anti-inflammatory activity in myocardial 17 as well as neural tissue in models of brain and spinal cord injuries, 18, 19 although with some conflicting findings. 20 Although long-term adverse effects and even pro-inflammatory consequences have been reported with the chronic use of VPA, 12 we believe that, given the urgent need to have .
