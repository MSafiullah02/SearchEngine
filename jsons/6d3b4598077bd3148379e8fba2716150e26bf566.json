During the first two decades of the procedure's history, liver transplantation led by Starzl and Sir Roy Calne of Cambridge encountered almost insurmountable challenges, including complexity of surgical technique, primitive anesthesia and intensive care, less-than-adequate immunosuppression and organ preservation, and devastating infection. The number of procedures performed was relatively few, and the success rate was low. However, their keen observations on these early clinical experiences laid the foundation of modern liver transplantation (Starzl and Putnam 1969; Calne 1983) .",

Despite liver mass constituting only 2.5 % of the total body weight, the total hepatic blood flow is approximately 100 mL/ 100 g/min, or 25 % of cardiac output. The hepatic artery supplies approximately 25-30 % of hepatic blood flow and 45-50 % of the oxygen requirement, while the portal vein supplies 70-75 % of hepatic blood flow and 50-55 % of oxygen. The venous drainage is through the right, middle, and left hepatic veins, which merge into the IVC. The valveless portal vein is a low pressure/low resistance circuit, while the hepatic artery is a high pressure/high resistance system. Hepatic 553-565, Copyright (2000) , with permission from Elsevier) blood flow is primarily regulated by local metabolic demand with an inverse relationship between portal venous and hepatic arterial flow: an increase in the hepatic adenosine level triggered by a reduced portal venous flow increases hepatic arterial blood flow (Gelman and Ernst 1977; Lautt et al. 1985) . The hepatic artery buffer response appears to be functional even after liver transplantation (Payen et al. 1990) , and this response may be responsible for the development of the small-for-size syndrome after living donor or split liver transplantation (Kiuchi et al. 1999 ). Small-for-size syndrome develops in a patient who received a donor graft that was less than 1 % of the recipient's body weight and is caused by decreased hepatic arterial flow in response to increased portal venous flow and pressure. Subsequently, a prolonged postoperative reduction in hepatic arterial flow can lead to centrilobular tissue necrosis, biliary ischemia, and hepatic arterial thrombosis (Smyrniotis et al. 2002) . There is no buffer response in the portal system because the portal vein cannot regulate its blood flow. Therefore, alterations in the hepatic arterial blood flow do not induce compensatory changes in the portal blood flow (Lautt 1983) .",

Polyhedral hepatocytes are arranged in one-cell thick plates with endothelium-lined sinusoids on both sides. Each hepatocyte cell membrane has three distinct membrane domains. The sinusoidal membrane is adjacent to the sinusoidal endothelium and has numerous microvilli abutting into the space of Disse. Fenestrae within the sinusoidal endothelium without the basement membrane permit intimate contact between sinusoidal blood and the hepatocytes to allow the passage of big molecules, including lipoproteins. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells make up 15-20 % of liver cells and release nitric oxide to regulate vascular resistance. They are, along with dendritic cells and lymphocytes, part of the innate immune system. The space of Disse contains phagocytic Kupffer cells that participate in the hepatic inflammatory process. The Ito cells, also known as stellate cells, are the major site of vitamin A storage, and their activation results in hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Terminal portal veins communicate with terminal hepatic venules, with sinusoids bridging the gap between the two vessels ( Fig. 2) . Each sinus contains three zones with equal blood pressure and oxygen content. The periportal zone (Zone 1) receives blood highest in oxygen content and the pericentral or perivenular zone (Zone 3) receives blood lowest in oxygen content. As a result, the hepatocytes in the perivenular zone (Zone 3) are more vulnerable to ischemic damage and nutrient depletion. Oxidative and reductive functions are predominantly performed by hepatocytes at the periportal zone and glucuronidation is performed by those at the perivenular zone, although hepatocytes of the two different zones are functionally integrated (Lamers et al. 1989 ). The unique structure of the liver acinus is well-suited for bidirectional transfer of nutrients. The low pressure in the portal venous system allows blood to flow slowly through the sinusoids. Hepatic arterial blood flows mainly to the terminal bile canaliculi, although it augments sinusoidal flow to give a gentle pulsatility. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the sinusoids acquire features of systemic capillaries: the space of Disse widens with collagen deposits at the basement membrane, endothelial fenestrations become smaller and fewer, and hepatic microvilli efface. All of these changes reduce transport across the sinusoidal walls and result in hepatic dysfunction. Furthermore, widespread fibrosis and scarring reduce the number and size of the small portal and hepatic veins and increase intrahepatic vascular resistance to the development of portal hypertension (Popper 1977) . The sluggish blood flow in the altered vascular architecture promotes thrombosis, causing further cell necrosis and fibrosis (Wanless et al. 1995) .",

This negative response suggests that liver regeneration involves a two-step process: the initial signal generated by an acute increase in metabolic demand associated with the loss of hepatocytes triggers a set of early response genes that prime hepatocytes to respond to various growth factors. In apoptosis or programmed cell death, aging hepatocytes are removed and new cells are produced in a continuous manner (Ellis et al. 1991 ).",

Caramelo et al. noted a 50 % decrease in cardiac output with volume expansion in a CCl 4 -induced cirrhotic rat model (Caramelo et al. 1986) . In another rat model, the chronotropic response to isoproterenol was attenuated compared with that in control animals (Lee et al. 1990 ). Cardiac response to physical exercise is blunted in patients with cirrhosis, indicated by alterations in the pre-ejection period, isometric contraction time, and ratio of the pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time. In addition, abnormalities in myocardial diastolic indices suggest non-compliant ventricles. Histologically, myocardial fibrosis, mild subendocardial edema, and vacuolation of myocyte nucleus and cytoplasms are observed. The development of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is multifactorial. It appears that the \u03b2-receptor system, the main stimulant of the ventricle, is dysfunctional. In humans, lymphocyte \u03b2-receptor density, which reflects cardiac \u03b2-receptor status, is reduced in patients with severe ascites (Gerbes et al. 1986) , and \u03b2-receptor density of the cardiomyocyte sarcolemmal plasma membrane is reduced in cirrhotic rats (Liu and Lee 1999) . Further, the \u03b2-receptor signal transduction pathway is impaired at several levels (Ma et al. 1996) . Although cardiac contractile impairment may result from overactivity of the muscarinic M 2 receptor, the receptor density and binding affinity are unchanged, suggesting normal parasympathetic function (Jaue et al. 1997) . High serum catecholamine levels, a result of desensitization and down-regulation of \u03b2-receptors, may lead to myocardial dysfunction in the presence of \u03b1-mediated coronary vasoconstriction. Additionally, overproduction of nitric oxide inhibits \u03b2-receptor-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) release, causing myocardial dysfunction and vasodilation (Hare and Colucci 1995) .",

The common causes are pleural effusions, impaired diffusion capacity, arteriovenous shunting, atelectasis caused by ascites or diaphragmatic dysfunction, aspiration secondary to encephalopathy, and deconditioning (Hourani et al. 1991) . Ventilation-perfusion mismatch, pulmonary vasodilation, and infection also contribute to hypoxemia. Mild forms of hypoxemia are most common, although moderate-tosevere hypoxemia may be found in patients with advanced liver disease complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), infection, and multiple organ failure. Hepatopulmonary syndrome, first described by Fluckiger in 1884 (Fluckiger 1884) , may cause severe hypoxemia in a subset of patients with liver disease. The syndrome consists of a triad of liver dysfunction, severe hypoxemia (PaO 2 < 70 mmHg in room air), and pulmonary vasodilation, and is characterized by dyspnea, cyanosis, clubbing of the digits, exercise desaturation, and orthodeoxia (hypoxemia in upright position). Other concomitant clinical signs are a markedly increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, portal hypertension, and vascular abnormality such as spider angioma and pulmonary vasodilation. The pulmonary vascular dilation (from 8-15 \u03bc to 15-100 \u03bc) at the precapillary level is believed to be the main pathology of the hepatopulmonary syndrome, which is caused by decreasing erythrocyte transit time and impairing diffusion of oxygen to the erythrocytes at the center of the bloodstream (Genovesi et al. 1976 ). In contrast with other pulmonary diseases, oxygenation improves dramatically with a high inspired oxygen concentration (FiO 2 ), because a high alveolar concentration of oxygen overcomes the diffusion barrier and oxygenates the erythrocytes in the center of the bloodstream. The pathophysiology and management of hepatopulmonary syndrome are described in \u25b6 Chap. 10, \"Hepatopulmonary Syndrome and Portopulmonary Hypertension\".",

The primary contributing factor for the hepatorenal syndrome is nitric oxide-induced vasodilation of the splanchnic vascular bed causing systemic arterial underfilling and relative hypovolemia (Arroyo et al. 1996) . This relative hypovolemia activates baroreceptor-mediated sympathetic and the renin-angiotensin system to constrict all vascular beds including the renal vasculature (Guevara et al. 1998 ). The initial prostaglandin-mediated compensatory renal vasodilation is followed by renal arterial vasoconstriction and renal hypoperfusion. A striking feature of the hepatorenal syndrome is the lack of any histologic change and its reversibility: the affected kidneys resume their function after successful liver transplantation. The renal failure may be rapid (Type 1) or insidious (Type 2) and results in sodium and water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. Since the hepatorenal syndrome is a functional renal failure, the urine is similar to that found in pre-renal azotemia: oliguria, low urinary sodium, and an increased urine osmolality and urine to plasma osmolality ratio.",

The only primary preventive measure showing some promise is the administration of albumin along with antibiotics as soon as the presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is diagnosed; this possibly works by preventing hypovolemia and subsequent activation of vasoconstrictor systems.",

A suggested strategy for cardiac assessment is shown in Fig. 3 (Raval et al. 2011) . Overall cardiac performance is evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography to assess myocardial contractility, abnormality in cardiac anatomy, intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunting, and pulmonary artery pressure. Most patients over age 50 years undergo non-invasive stress testing because they may have multiple CAD risk factors (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pre-existing cardiovascular disease), and limited physical activity masks underlying ischemic heart disease. An exercise stress test may not be feasible in many patients with advanced liver disease, and dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is commonly used, although adenosine or dipyridamole may be used when dobutamineinduced tachycardia is not desirable. DSE, with its high sensitivity and specificity, appears to be the most reliable screening test (Plotkin et al. 1998) , and dobutamine-induced tachycardia may mimic intraoperative stress on the cardiovascular system. On the contrary, DSE has been reported to have poor sensitivity (as low as 13 %) and negative predictive value (as low as 75 %) (Harinstein et al. 2008) , and its results may not correlate with adverse cardiac events within 30 days after transplantation (Safadi et al. 2009 ).",

The dissection stage begins with an inverted Y-shaped bilateral subcostal skin incision and ends with the skeletonization of the diseased liver. The anhepatic stage begins with the occlusion of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and IVC for hepatectomy. However, the patient is virtually anhepatic once the hepatic artery or portal vein is occluded.

This flush technique allows preservation solution, metabolites, and air in the donor liver to escape through the incompletely anastomosed infrahepatic IVC.

Once the hepatic hilum is dissected, cannulas are inserted into the left superficial femoral vein (7 mm) and portal vein (9 mm) for outflow from the patient and into the left axillary vein (7 mm) for venous inflow. The cannula site and size may vary depending on the preference of the surgical team or anatomic variations. The cannulas and heparin-bonded tubings are flushed with heparin solution (2000 U/L) to avoid thrombosis during preparation. Systemic heparinization is not used because of the presence of pre-existing coagulopathy and the use of heparin-bonded tubings. The bypass run begins by unclamping all cannulas while the pump speed is gradually increased to achieve the maximal flow rate. Hepatectomy and anastomoses of the suprahepatic and infrahepatic IVC are performed once full bypass is achieved. The removal of the portal cannula for portal venous anastomosis leads to a partial bypass, which reduces venous return.

In general, there are two schools of thought about maintaining hemodynamic stability. The first endorses maintaining the hyperdynamic state to optimize cardiac output and tissue perfusion. Patients with ESLD have generalized vasodilation and are known to have oxygen debt at the tissue level. Therefore, maintaining the hyperdynamic state, instead of 'normal blood pressure,' ensures ample oxygen delivery to tissues and avoids tissue acidosis. This, in turn, optimizes tissue metabolism and hepatic blood flow. The second school of thought endorses maintaining arterial blood pressure within the normal range. This may include the use of various vasopressors (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, etc.) with or without hypovolemia. In extreme cases, blood is removed from the patient to induce hypovolemia, and blood pressure is supported by vasopressors (Massicotte et al. 2010) ; it has been claimed that blood loss is minimal without increasing perioperative complications, although fluid restriction may lead to tissue ischemia, renal failure, and air embolism (Melendez et al. 1998; Schroeder et al. 2004 ). Further, \u03b1-vasopressors (norepinephrine and phenylephrine) decrease hepatic blood flow by reducing portal venous flow dramatically in the presence of a limited hepatic arterial buffer response (Mehrabi et al. 2005 ).",

Intravascular volume is usually replenished by administration of a mixture of PRBCs and FFP (typically, PRBC:FFP: PlasmaLyte-A \u00ae = 200:300:250 mL) using a rapid-infusion device. This mixture yields hematocrit of 26-28 vol.% and coagulation factor levels of 30-50 % of normal. A low hematocrit is chosen to optimize microcirculation and minimize the RBC wastage. Calcium-containing fluid (i.e., lactated Ringer's solution) should not be used to prevent clot formation in the reservoir of the rapid-infusion device. Continuous administration of FFP is necessary to compensate for the loss of coagulation elements (procoagulants, prolysins, and their inhibitors) by surgical bleeding and excessive activation of coagulation. In patients with minimal blood loss, colloids (albumin or FFP) and crystalloids may be required to compensate for the third-space fluid loss and continuous production of ascites. Close communication with the surgical team is essential to identify the cause of hemodynamic instability, as is communication with the blood bank to facilitate adequate supply of blood products. Intraoperative autotransfusion has been shown to be effective and safe during liver transplantation, and its use may be considered when the PRBC requirement is >5 units. Its use is not recommended for patients with peritoneal infection or malignancy (Liang et al. 2008 ).",

In portopulmonary hypertension with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, the presence of right ventricular function is investigated. A low cardiac output with a high CVP suggests the presence of right ventricular dysfunction. TEE findings of right ventricle dysfunction are low fractional area change (FAC), tricuspid annular plane excursion (TAPSE) of <16 mm, flattening of the ventricular septum, apicalization of the right ventricle, and right ventricular dilation. Additionally, the pulmonary vascular response to various vasodilators (i.e., diltiazem, nitroglycerin, epoprostenol, and nitric oxide) may be evaluated. Liver transplantation may continue when pulmonary hypertension is mild to moderate with normal right ventricular function.

A prolonged low output state, portal hypertension, and renal venous congestion may lead to acidosis, intestinal swelling, and hematuria.

Hence, hemodynamic changes that occur during the anhepatic stage with venovenous bypass are minimal when the bypass flow rate is greater than 25 % of the baseline cardiac output and, therefore, the bypass flow should be monitored and adjusted as needed. Improper positioning of the cannula tip in the femoral or portal vein, or a kinked bypass circuit, may not drain blood adequately and the surgical team should correct their positions. A low pump speed reduces venous return, while a high pump speed collapses the outflow venous wall and decreases the bypass flow. The perfusionist, therefore, should adjust the pump speed to maximize the bypass flow. In addition, hypovolemia decreases the bypass flow, and it should be corrected by the anesthesia team. The anesthesia and surgical teams should be prepared for potential acute complications of venovenous bypass. Bleeding or air entry may result from venous laceration during cannulation or improperly secured cannulas. Entry of a small volume of air (up to 50 mL) into the bypass pump may not cause immediate systemic air embolism because it is trapped in the cone-shaped pump head by centripetal force. Thromboembolism may be caused by the migration of pre-existing thrombi or those developed during a low bypass flow rate (<1000 mL/min), particularly in hypercoagulable conditions (i.e., Budd-Chiari syndrome, neoplasms, and congenital protein C deficiency). Most importantly, the bypass may have to be terminated unexpectedly when serious complications occur. Therefore, the anesthesia team should be prepared for unexpected cross-clamping of the IVC and portal vein at all times. After completion of the IVC anastomosis, the portal cannula is removed to facilitate the portal venous anastomosis, resulting in partial bypass. Low bypass flow and low cardiac output during this period can be improved by the administration of fluids or dopamine, but full correction of central hypovolemia, as reflected on CVP, PCWP, or TEE, is avoided to prevent fluid overload on reperfusion.",

Hepatectomy in the presence of portal hypertension can be difficult, and hypovolemia is not uncommon as a consequence of inadvertent compression of the IVC and portal vein, partial side-clamping of the IVC, and cross-clamping of the portal vein during portal anastomosis.

Unclamping of the infrahepatic IVC and portal vein results in transient hypovolemia and hypotension due to acute sequestration of the blood in the engrafted liver. Unclamping of the suprahepatic IVC increases preload by mobilizing blood from the low extremities and splanchnic circulation. This is followed by severe hemodynamic changes, the so-called postreperfusion syndrome (Aggarwal et al. 1993) . The postreperfusion syndrome, which occurs in approximately 30 % of patients, is defined by abrupt hypotension (below 70 % of the baseline value) that develops within 5 min of reperfusion and lasts for more than 1 min. Other associated hemodynamic changes are bradycardia, high CVP and PCWP, low systemic vascular resistance, and conduction defects. Acute reduction in myocardial contractility is observed in TEE. The postreperfusion syndrome appears to be caused by a combination of several factors. For example, an acute increase in preload may result in right ventricular strain and an acute decrease in blood temperature (2-3 C) by the systemic entry of the cold preservation solution may decrease cardiac conduction and contractility. Other physical factors are air embolism and thromboembolism, which may cause right ventricular strain or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (Ellis et al. 1989; Suriani et al. 1996) . Chemical factors involved are acute hyperkalemia and acidosis. Systemic entry of hyperkalemic preservation solution increases serum potassium level to a very high level (up to 12 mmol/L), causing severe bradycardia and conduction defects (Martin 1986 ). Return of the acidic blood from the viscera and lower extremities increases the base deficit by 5-10 mmol/L. In addition, unknown endogenous vasodilators or myocardial depressants (i.e., vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, nitric oxide, and eicosanoid) released from the allograft or congested viscera may decrease systemic vascular resistance and impair myocardial function.",

Minute volume is gradually decreased during the anhepatic stage to match the reduced oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, and is increased during the neohepatic stage. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers are performed intermittently to avoid atelectasis caused by pleural effusions, cephalad traction of the rib cage, and compression of diaphragm. Intermittent endotracheal suctioning, using a suction catheter or bronchoscope, may be required to remove secretions. Drainage of pleural effusions and ascites decreases intrathoracic pressure and improves oxygenation within 2 h. Patients with preoperative ARDS may require a high FiO 2 and a high level of PEEP to ensure adequate gas exchange, and a volume ventilator may be necessary to overcome the high airway pressure. Frank pulmonary edema can develop, particularly after reperfusion, from the increased pulmonary capillary permeability or fluid overload. In such cases, patients are ventilated with a high level of FiO 2 and PEEP, while the underlying cause is treated. Closure of the abdominal cavity may interfere with ventilation by increasing intrathoracic and airway pressures. Primary closure with mesh or secondary closure may be necessary.",

Fibrinolysis may develop, particularly in patients with hepatocellular disease, as a result of a low level of inhibitors of fibrinolysis and impaired hepatic clearance of tPA (Lewis et al. 1989a) . Excessive activation of coagulation, evidenced by a gradual increase in thrombin-antithrombin complex, develops at the end of the dissection stage (Kratzer et al. 1991) . Management of coagulation begins with normalization of physiologic variables, such as ionic hypocalcemia, hypothermia, and acidosis impair coagulation (Rohrer and Natale 1992) . This is followed by continuous infusion of coagulation factor-rich blood (RBC:FFP: PlasmaLyte-A \u00ae or normal saline = 1 unit:1 unit:250 mL) to maintain coagulation factor levels above the critical level (30-50 % of normal). Specific blood components may be administered based on TEG/ROTEM. In general, platelets (5-10 units) are administered for a small maximum amplitude (MA) (<40 mm). Platelet administration, in addition to increasing MA, improves reaction time (r) and clot formation rate (\u03b1), because the coagulation cascade leading to fibrin formation occurs on the surface of platelets. Its administration, however, is withheld during the anhepatic stage to avoid potential thrombosis and during massive blood transfusion (>150 mL/min) to minimize wastage. Two units of FFP may be administered when the reaction time is prolonged (r> 12 min) even after platelet administration Cryoprecipitate (6 units) containing factors I and VIII are rarely required unless severe fibrinolysis is left untreated because plasmin selectively destroys factors I, V, and VIII. However, cryoprecipitate may be used for patients with severe hypofibrinogenemia (<100 mg/dL).",

The heparin effect is seen as a prolonged aPTT and reaction time on TEG/ROTEM at the onset of the venovenous bypass as a small dose of heparin (2000-5000 units) in the bypass circuit enters systemic circulation. This heparin effect dissipates over the next 30-60 min. The effects of the absence of the hepatic synthetic and clearance function begin to develop during this stage. The absence of hepatic clearance of tPA promotes fibrinolysis in approximately 30 % of patients . Similarly, the absence of hepatic clearance of activated coagulation factors results in excessive activation of coagulation evidenced by a progressive increase in thrombin-antithrombin complex and fibrin (ogen) degradation products. Severe fibrinolysis (fibrinolysis time <60 min) may be treated by the administration of a single, small dose of EACA (250-500 mg) ). Administration of a large or repeated dose of EACA is not recommended in order to avoid potential thromboembolism (Gologorsky et al. 2001) . The postreperfusion syndrome occurs in coagulation at the onset of the neohepatic stage. A typical coagulation profile shows prolonged PT, aPTT, reptilase time, and thrombin time. A generalized decrease in coagulation factors (I, V, VII, and VIII) and platelets is accompanied by a sharp increase in the tPA level, a shortened euglobulin lysis time, and a moderate increase in fibrin(ogen) degradation products and thrombin-antithrombin complex. Fibrinolysis is observed in up to 80 % of patients and is severe in about 40 % . Fibrinolysis is caused by a 20-fold increase in tPA being released from the allograft and congested viscera, which overwhelms the activity of the plasminogen activator inhibitor (Virji et al. 1989; Porte et al. 1989 ). There are ample data to support the finding that fibrinolysis is primary in origin: a relatively steady antithrombin level, only moderate levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products and D-dimers, selective decreases in factors I, V, and VIII, and no known microthrombi formation (Lewis et al. 1989a, b) . Fibrinolysis resolves over the 120 min following reperfusion. The heparin effect occurs in approximately 30 % of patients, as heparin is released from the allograft and dissipates over the next 60-90 min.",

Prophylactic administration of EACA or tranexamic acid (AMCA) is a common practice in many centers, but has not shown scientific efficacy. Fibrinolysis prophylaxis is not recommended by the authors, because the presence of fibrinolysis can easily be detected by TEG/ROTEM and can be treated effectively with a small dose of EACA in most patients.

Aprotinin (2,000,000 KIU followed by 500,000 KIU/h), a non-specific inhibitor of plasminogen and serine protease, may reduce blood loss by inhibiting fibrinolysis and excessive activation of coagulation (Neuhaus et al. 1989; Cottam et al. 1991 ). However, clinical use of aprotinin declined even before the drug was withdrawn by the manufacturer: clinical reports did not show a significant reduction in blood loss (Ickx et al. 1993; Groh et al. 1993) , and fibrinolysis can be treated with EACA or AMCA more efficiently with negligible side effects Boylan et al. 1996) . Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been suggested to improve coagulation and reduces bleeding by actively enhancing coagulation and stimulating fibrin formation in the presence of tissue factor. Its beneficial effects have been shown in patients with fulminant hepatic failure, \"critical bleeding,\" and a ruptured liver (Meadows et al. 2011; Merchant et al. 2004; Yamaguchi et al. 2015) . However, results of clinical trials are controversial (Planinsic et al. 2005; Gasperi and Baudo 2006; Niemann et al. 2006 ) and a European consensus concluded that a paucity of data from clinical trials with rFVIIa limits both the strength and the scope of clinical recommendations (Vincent et al. 2006) . Recently, the use of prothrombin complex concentrate has been assessed in a limited number of centers. Prothrombin complex concentrate is prepared from FFP and contains clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, protein C, and protein S, and its use may improve coagulation without increasing preload (Arshad et al. 2013 ). However, it has limited components of coagulation and its clinical advantage requires further investigation. Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), a synthetic analog of 8-arginine vasopressin, increases the endothelial release of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen. Its beneficial effects have been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with liver disease, and it may be used to improve coagulation (0.3 \u03bcg/kg) . Conjugated estro-gen has been reported to improve coagulation and reduce blood loss (Frenette et al. 1998) , although its use has not been accepted widely.",

Moderate hypokalemia (<3.5 mmol/L) is not treated because it is welltolerated by patients and self-corrected by blood transfusion.

In patients with fulminant hepatic failure or severe hepatocellular disease, the blood glucose level may decrease precipitously, making glucose supplementation necessary. Hyperglycemia (up to 300 mg/dL) occurs on reperfusion as glucose is released from the engrafted liver (DeWolf et al. 1987 ).

The insulin level is relatively steady during surgery, and the glucagon level increases after reperfusion. The blood glucose level usually returns to normal within 12-24 h.

This so-called mass reflex is caused by the neurogenic vasoconstriction and stimulation of adrenal medulla by reflex spinal arc. Isoflurane is the most commonly used agent, because its myocardial depression is relatively benign, and short-acting narcotics (i.e., fentanyl, up to 5 \u03bcg/kg/min) may be used in unstable donors.

            "text": "The specific goals of ventilatory care are to maintain normal PaO 2 (70-100 mmHg), arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (>95 %), and PaCO 2 (35-45 mmHg) as well as to avoid pulmonary complications. This goal is frequently achieved by ventilating with a tidal volume of 10-15 mL/kg, FiO 2 of 30-40 %, respiratory rate of <20/min, and a low level of PEEP (<5 cmH 2 O). However, in donors with pulmonary complications, adjustments are made in tidal volume (up to 20 mL/kg), respiratory rate (up to 20/min), and PEEP (up to 10 cmH 2 O). Aggressive circulatory care is essential because hemodynamic instability may impair organ perfusion. Specifically, hypotension (systolic blood pressure <80 mmHg or mean arterial pressure <40 mmHg) is associated with a high incidence of acute tubular necrosis, non-function of the graft kidneys, and poor hepatic function. It is generally agreed that systolic blood pressure should be within the normal range (100-120 mmHg) and CVP should be <10 cmH 2 O with minimal vasopressor support. Maintaining circulatory homeostasis, however, can be challenging. Preload is frequently decreased because of blood loss, vasomotor paralysis, diuretic therapy, and diabetes inspidus, although fluid resuscitation may result in overload. The heart rate may vary depending on the degree of brain injury, ranging from tachycardia to bradycardia. Arrhythmia is not uncommon, and myocardial contractility is frequently impaired by myocytolysis, myocardial necrosis, coronary spasm, and reduction of myocardial energy storage (Novitzky et al. 1988 ). Afterload may be high, from excessive sympathetic tone, or low, from vasomotor paralysis. Volume deficit is usually corrected with lactated Ringer's or colloid solution, and transfusion of PRBCs (1-3 units) may be necessary to maintain hematocrit between 25 and 35 % (Hardesty and Griffith 1986) . Once the fluid deficit is corrected, a glucose-containing hypotonic solution (5 % dextrose in 0.45 % NaCl 1 mL/kg/h) is administered to replace urine output and insensible loss, guided by CVP and urine output. Excessive urine output (>200-250 mL/h) is replaced using a hypotonic electrolyte solution with supplementation of KCl (20 mEq/L). Tachycardia with hypertension should be avoided as it may cause pulmonary edema, decrease organ perfusion, and increase myocardial oxygen consumption. A \u03b2-antagonist (i.e., labetalol hydrochloride or esmolol hydrochloride) or a calcium channel blocker (verapamil hydrochloride) is used to treat tachycardia and arrhythmia (Novitzky et al. 1984) . For bradycardia, isoproterenol or epinephrine is used for positive chronotropic effects because donors are unresponsive to centrally acting chronotropic drugs (i.e., atropine). Supraventricular or ventricular arrythmia is treated using antiarrhythmic drugs. Low afterload is compensated for by increasing preload because \u03b1-vasopressors increase the myocardial work load and decrease splanchnic and coronary blood flow. In severely hypertensive donors, an \u03b1-blocker (hydralazine or sodium nitroprusside) may be given to reduce the afterload. When cardiac output and organ perfusion are impaired, inotropes (dopamine hydrochloride, dobutamine hydrochloride, and isoproterenol hydrochloride) are recommended to improve cardiac contractility. In brain-dead animal models, serum levels of triiodothyronine, insulin, and cortisol have been found to be low, and the administration of triiodothyronine may improve hemodynamic stability by maintaining myocardial high-energy stores and glycogen (James et al. 2010) . Circulatory arrest, which occurs in 10 % of potential donors (Emery et al. 1986) , is managed in the standard fashion, except atropine is not effective.",
