Simple systems have one-to-one relationships and their behaviour is precisely predictable. Complicated systems have one-to-many relationships with mostly predictable behaviours \u2022 This book deals with complex adaptive systems with many-to-many relationships. Their many-to-many relationships make their behaviour emergent, hence their outcomes are unpredictable. Complex adaptive systems have a special characteristic, the members of the system can learn from feedback and experiences. The relationships in complex adaptive systems change constantly allowing the system to evolve over time in light of changing demands. However, a system's overall behaviour, despite its adaptation to changing circumstances, remains relatively stable within boundaries, but occasionally, its behaviour may change abruptly and dramatically for no apparent reason",

A complex system's structure describes the collection of agents (A-H) contained within a permeable or fuzzy boundary (black circle), where each agent represents a smaller subsystems (a1-a4) and is part of a larger supra-system (dotted line) (top left). Agents are interconnected in multiple ways (top right), and interconnection often result in feedback loops that either reinforce (C) or self-stabilise ( ) the system's dynamic behaviour (bottom left). The dynamic behaviour of a complex system can vary greatly with even small changes in a variable's starting (initial) condition (bottom right). Whilst systems are bounded they receive inputs from and provide outputs to other systems (X-Z) within a larger supra-system any one element of the system may interact with multiple other elements of the system. Relationships are still linear and outcomes remain predictable. Generally speaking, \"complicated\" refers to systems with sophisticated configurations but highly predictable behaviours (e.g. a car or a plane)-the whole can be decomposed into its parts and when reassembled will look and behave again exactly like the whole.

Complex systems are also open, loosely bounded, and influenced by their environment. Such fuzzy boundaries entail some arbitrariness in defining a system. While any one system as a whole may be defined as a complex system, inevitably subunits are also complex systems in their own right. Thus any defined complex system has to be thought of as being simultaneously a subsystem of a larger system (or a supra-system) and a supra-system constituted by a number of subsystems (defining the nested structure of systems).",

Core values are those that remain unchanged in a changing world. 5 If internalised and adhered to by all agents it results in the \"smooth running\" of the system (e.g. the flocking birds) [43, 47, 54, 55] \u2022 \"Simple rules\" provide the necessary \"safe space/freedom\" to adapt an agent's behaviour under changing conditions. Adaptation is desirable; it fosters creativity and provides flexibility; it is the prerequisite for the emergence of the system and the achievement of its goals (learning) [43, 47, 54, 55] In CAS \"control\" tends to be highly dispersed and decentralised [38] . CAS activity results in patterned outcomes, based on purpose, goals, and values within the constraints of the local context. These outcomes, while not necessarily intuitively obvious, are the result of the emergent and self-organising behaviour of the system. Local outcome patterns, while different, are \"mutually agreeable\". Of note, system solutions-often termed innovations-are unique; they cannot be transferred from one place to another as the local conditions that resulted in the system's outcome will be different, the reason why even proven innovations fail when transferred into a different context [56] .",

There is something inherently reductionist in the process of definition. This process tries to capture the precise meaning of a concept in terms of its essential properties. It would be self-defeating to start an investigation into the nature of complexity by using exactly those methods we are trying to criticise! On the other hand, we cannot leave the notion of \"complexity\" merely dangling in the air; we have to give it some content. This will be done by making a number of distinctions which will constrain the meaning of the notion 6 without pinning it down in a final way. The characterisation developed in this way is thus not final-in specific contexts there may be more characteristics one could add, and some of those presented here may not always be applicable-but it helps us to make substantial claims about the nature of complexity, claims that may shift our understanding in radical ways.",

Complex systems, on the other hand, come to be in the interaction of the components. If one takes it apart, the emergent properties are destroyed.

If there is too little structure (i.e. many degrees of freedom), the system can behave more randomly, but not more functionally. The mere \"capacity\" of the system (i.e. the total amount of degrees of freedom available if the system was not structured in any way) does not serve as a meaningful indicator of the complexity of the system. Complex behaviour is possible when the behaviour of the system is constrained. On the other hand, a fully constrained system has no capacity for complex behaviour either. This claim is not quite the same as saying that complexity exists somewhere on the edge between order and chaos. A wide range of structured systems display complex behaviour \u2022 Since different descriptions of a complex system decompose the system in different ways, the knowledge gained by any description is always relative to the perspective from which the description was made. This does not imply that any description is as good as any other. It is merely the result of the fact that only a limited number of characteristics of the system can be taken into account by any specific description. Although there is no a priori procedure for deciding which description is correct, some descriptions will deliver more interesting results than others \u2022 In describing the macro-behaviour (or emergent behaviour) of the system, not all the micro-features can be taken into account. The description on the macro-level is thus a reduction of complexity, and cannot be an exact description of what the system actually does. Moreover, the emergent properties on the macro-level can influence the micro-activities, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as \"topdown causation\". Nevertheless, macro-behaviour is not the result of anything else but the micro-activities of the system, keeping in mind that these are not only influenced by their mutual interaction and by top-down effects, but also by the interaction of the system with its environment. When we do science, we usually work with descriptions which operate mainly on a macro-level. These descriptions will always be approximations of some kind These insights have important implications for the knowledge-claims we make when dealing with complex systems. Since we do not have direct access to the complexity itself, our knowledge of such systems is in principle limited. The problematic status of our knowledge of complexity needs to be discussed in a little more detail. Before doing that, some attention will be paid to three problems: identifying the boundaries of complex systems, the role of hierarchical structure, and the difficulties involved in modelling complexity.",

There are many neurons interacting adaptively to form a representation, for example, of a visual scene; in economy, there are many individual agents deciding on the price of a good, and so forth; a political system voting for the next president. All of these systems have individual entities that are heterogeneous and acquire information according to a unique history about the world in which they live.

A complex system's structure describes the collection of agents (A-H) contained within a permeable or fuzzy boundary (black circle), where each agent represents a smaller subsystems (a1-a4) and is part of a larger supra-system (dotted line) (top left). Agents are interconnected in multiple ways (top right), and interconnection often result in feedback loops that either reinforce (C) or self-stabilise ( ) the system's dynamic behaviour (bottom left). The dynamic behaviour of a complex system can vary greatly with even small changes in a variable's starting (initial) condition (bottom right). Whilst systems are bounded they receive inputs from and provide outputs to other systems (X-Z) within a larger supra-system",
