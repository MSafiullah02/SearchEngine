M.Roem [synonyms: Cedrela sinensis Juss, xi\u0101ngch\u016bn (in Chinese)], belonging to Meliaceae family and popularly known as Chinese toon or Chinese mahogany, is a deciduous woody plant native to eastern and southeastern Asia (Liao et al., 2009). T. sinensis has a cultivation history more than 2000 years and is used as a vegetable source in China and Malaysia, and as animal fodder in India (Liao et al., 2007). T. sinensis is also widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and various parts tissues of this plant have been used for a wide variety of diseases. The stems and leaves of TSR are traditionally used for the treatment of dysentery, enteritis, carminative and itchiness, etc. (Dong et al., 2013a, Dong et al., 2013b). The roots are used as correctives, the bark is used as astringent and depurative, and the fruits are used as astringent for the treatment of eye infections (Perry, 1980). Previous phytochemical investigations on this plant have revealed that the main constituents include terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and anthraquinones (Feng et al., 2007, Mu et al., 2007, Hsieh et al., 2008). Modern researches have also reported that T. sinensis possessed various pharmacological activities including anti-tumor effects, antioxidant effects, anti-diabetic effects, anti-inflammatory effects, antibacterial and antiviral effects. (Chen et al., 2007, Cheng et al., 2009, Wu et al., 2010) (Fig. 1\n).",

In Chinese folk medicine, T. sinensis was described as an herbal medicine with good anti-inflammatory, detoxifying and hemostatic effects, and thus this plant was commonly used to treat enteritis, dysentery, urinary tract infection, leukorrheal diseases and skin itch (Anonymous, 1977, Anonymous, 1999, Li et al., 2006). Furthermore, due to its special onion-like flavor and wealth of carotene and vitamins B and C, the edible leaves and young shoots of T. sinensis are also delicious and nutritious food stuff in China and other Southeast Asia countries (Anonymous, 1999, Dong et al., 2013a).",

In 2003, the research team of Yang et al. (2003) reported that ethanol extracts of T. sinensis leaf (ETSL) could enhance the cellular glucose uptake in basal and insulin stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In 2015, Liu et al. (2015) revealed that the mechanisms of TSL stimulating glucose uptake and ameliorating insulin resistance might be related to AMPK activation in skeletal muscles and up-regulation of PPAR\u03b3 and normalized adiponectin in adipose tissues. In 2005, the inhibitory effect of TSL on LDL glycation induced by glucose and glyoxal was reported (Hsieh et al., 2005). It was also indicated that TSL could alleviate hyperglycemia via altering adipose glucose transporter 4 (Wang et al., 2008a, Wang et al., 2008b), and results of Zhang et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2011 indicated that total flavonoids of T. sinensis (FTSL) might be the active constituents corresponding to the hypoglycemic effects of this plant. Furthermore, it is reported that extracts of the seeds of T. sinensis (STSL) has hypoglycemic and kidney protecting effects in diabetic rats (Du et al., 2011, Li et al., 2016), and Xing and Chen found that total polyphenols from the seeds of T. sinensis (TPST) could inhibit hepatic injury at early stage in diabetic rats (Xing and Chen, 2011). In 2012, Hsieh et al. (2012) indicated the supercritical-CO2 fluid extracted non-polar leaves extract of T. sinensis (NPTSL) could prevent the progression of type 2 diabetes. Besides, Zhao et al. (2009) reported that in this plant, gallic acid, (+)-catechin (64), (\u2212)-epicatechin (65, and procyanidin B3 (66), and B4 showed \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities with IC50 of 24.3, 190.7, 189.0, 111.0, and 89.0 \u03bcM, respectively.

In the present review, 109 compounds from different parts of this plant were summarized, and these compounds mainly concluded terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids, etc. Additionally, the existing pharmacological investigations have revealed that agents or extracts from this plant have a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects which is beneficial for the health of human being, in particular for its anti-tumor and hypoglycemic activities. Emerging evidences from animal experiments and in vitro studies have demonstrated some traditional uses of T. sinensis; however, new drug development for this plant is still require lots of detailed studies in both the preclinical and clinical works.",

Thus, more works should be done on the toxicities and pharmacokinetic profile of T. sinensis. Secondly, previous researches have reported various pharmacological effects of T. sinensis, however most of the researches only focused on the crude extract and gallic acid in this plant. Gallic acid have obvious biological activities, however, it's not a characteristic compound of T. sinensis. Due to this plant contains abundant terpenoids, extensive researches are required to investigate the pharmacological properties of monomers belonging to terpenoids in this plant. Third, as a traditional delicious food and nutritious food stuff, previous researches have revealed that this plant possesses good anti-tumor, hypoglycemic and antioxidant effects, the tender shoots and leaves of T. sinensis also have the huge potential for functional food development. Fourth, the T. sinensis was traditional used to treat dysentery, enteritis, carminative, itchiness, and eye infections in Chinese folk medicine. However, not all of these traditional uses above were demonstrated by current pharmacological experiments; thus, more possible medicinal potentials of this plant might be investigated in the future. Lastly, there is no clinic trial of this plant, thus more works should be devoted to do some systemic clinic trials for T. sinensis in the future.",
