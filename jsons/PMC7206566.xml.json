A combination of different mutations on different genes is likely as mutations that have been identified to date do not qualify as sole causes for FIP.5\u20138 This results in FCoV strains with different genome sequences in each cat with FIP,6,9,10 highlighting that there are multiple pseudo-strains of FCoV within an individual cat and that a single consistent mutation responsible for all cases of FIP does not exist. Following mutation, increased virulence of FCoV is the result of a change in viral cell tropism from enterocytes to macrophages and efficient replication within these cells.11,12 As the FCoV spike (S) protein plays a key role in viral cell entry,13 studies have investigated the mutations in the S gene as possible contributing reasons for the change in virulence.14\u201316 One study identified mutations in close proximity in the S gene\u2019s nucleotides 23531 and 23537, causing two different amino acid substitutions in the S protein.5 In contrast to other S gene mutations,14 mutations in nucleotide 23531 and 23537 were identified in 96% of FCoVs isolated from cats with FIP in that study. These mutations were not identified in faecal samples of clinically healthy control cats in that study; however, no organ samples from these control cats were analysed.5",

This has already been observed in other studies using the same method.27,33 Another reason could be the absence of the particular S gene mutations examined here and the presence of other mutations involved in FIP pathogenesis instead.6,8,9,14,15,38,39 Some other mutations, such as in the 3c gene, have been discussed as playing a role in FIP pathogenesis, but a clear causal relationship to FIP still has not been identified.6,7,40,41 Most likely, a combination of different mutations leads to the FCoV virulence change and, ultimately, to the development of FIP. As such, some of the cats in the present study might have experienced other mutations in their viral genome and therefore had negative results in S gene mutation RT-PCR.",

Interestingly, although S gene mutation RT-PCR was negative despite a high virus load in one sample, FCoV with S gene mutation or mixed FCoV (both FCoVs with and without S gene mutations) were detected in at least one different tissue or fluid in all of the four cats. For example, cat 18 had a high FCoV load in multiple organ samples, but S gene mutation RT-PCR was negative in these samples. However, FCoV with mutated S gene was detected in EDTA blood. This cat had histological lesions typical for FIP and positive IHC in the majority of organs, which confirms that FIP was present. These findings emphasise that a concurrent infection with different FCoV strains (non-mutated and mutated) is obviously possible and that in terms of virus kinetics, the process of evolving FIP in a patient is not a stable state.",

Percentages of positive RT-PCR results were similar for FNAs and IBs in most intra-abdominal organs and identical in mesenteric lymph nodes and liver for S gene mutation RT-PCR and in spleen for 7b gene RT-PCR. This is an unexpected but important result, as obtaining an IB is highly invasive and usually cannot be performed without anaesthesia. An earlier study examined whether FNA and tissue biopsies taken with a needle core device of liver and kidneys would be equally useful for diagnosing FIP via immunostaining (IHC or immunocytochemistry) and, in contrast to the findings of the present study, reported that sensitivities of immunostaining in the minimally invasive FNA and tissue biopsies were not satisfactory (11\u201331%).45 In the present study, the percentage of positive 7b gene RT-PCR results in both FNA and IB was similar to or sometimes even higher than the percentage of positive IHC in the respective organs (Table 4). This demonstrates the advantage of RT-PCR detecting small amounts of virus,31 whereas immunostaining requires more material and intact cells. Of course, histopathology and IHC, which are performed in combination, have the advantage of giving indicators to the presence of other disease processes and not just presence or absence of FCoV. But when only minimally invasive sampling is possible and cytology is non-diagnostic, RT-PCR should be preferred over immunostaining to detect FCoV. Another advantage of FNA is the possibility of targeting various locations; for example, ultrasound-guided sampling of several lesions or regions within organs. This is beneficial, as virus distribution can be inhomogeneous within an organ.",
