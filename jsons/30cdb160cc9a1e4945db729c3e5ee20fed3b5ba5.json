[1] highlighting the risks of infection during tracheostomy for the healthcare professionals that represent more than 10% of the total infected population in Italy, according to the latest report from the Italian Superior Institute of Health [2]. The paper proposes a step-by-step method for a safer tracheostomy for those patients affected by COVID-19 requiring a mechanical ventilation. The CORONA procedure proposed in the above mentioned work should be followed, in our opinion, not only for those patients affected by COVID-19 but for all the patients needing a temporary or permanent tracheostomy also in future.",

On the contrary the HMEFs can filter bacterial and viral particles. HMEFs are widely used in anesthesia circuits. The moisture exchange component passively humidifies the inspired air by returning a percentage of the patient's expired moisture. The filter component of the HMEF reduces the risk of viral and bacterialcross-contamination between patients. Several bacterial/viral filters are available in the market coupled or not with HME. These filters have high viral filtration efficiency (up to 99.99%), are bidirectional, protecting both the patients and the healthcare professionals; the pleated hydrophobic membrane filters have a superior filtration performance compared with electrostatic filters[4].",
