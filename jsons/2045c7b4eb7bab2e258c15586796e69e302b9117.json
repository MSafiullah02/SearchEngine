In this regard, there are two completely different approaches governments can take: a restrictive one, in which drastic measures such as self-isolation can seriously damage the economy, and a more liberal one, where more relaxed restrictions may put at risk a high percentage of the population. The optimal approach could be somewhere in between, and, in order to make the right decisions, it is necessary to accurately estimate the future effects of taking one or other measures. In this paper, we use the SEIR epidemiological model (Susceptible -Exposed -Infected -Recovered) for infectious diseases to represent the evolution of the virus COVID-19 over time in the population. To optimize the best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that hospitals are not overwhelmed with critical patients, and secondly, avoiding taking drastic measures for too long which can potentially cause serious damage to the economy. We created three different scenarios and we defined a reward system to prioritize the sequences of actions that fulfilled the objectives. The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid tool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of a pandemic in both senses. We also prove that the approach based on Deep Q-Learning overcomes the one based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the sequences of actions.",

A domino effect took place and a high percentage of the population lost their job, which generated a very difficult scenario for the government of each country. There was some uncertainty about when the situation will come back to normal. The COVID-19 pandemic became overnight a game-changer in the economy and in the lifestyle of billions of people.

For example, not saturating the healthcare system capacity is of paramount importance. If the number of cases exceeds the number of available beds or ventilators at hospitals, the mortality rate can rapidly increase, provoking a tragic situation [4] . Broadly speaking, there are basically two extreme approaches of the spectrum in a situation like this. On the one hand, a restrictive one, which is protecting the population by imposing the use of global self-isolation. And on the other hand, a more relaxed approach which consists in not taking any action at all. The first one has a much higher negative effect on the economy of a country since most businesses have to close down whereas the latter favours much more the economic flow but can provoke a high number of deaths. There are some other approaches in between such as partial lock-downs, encouraging the population to keep the social distance, facilitating the use of masks, and encouraging frequent washing of hands [5] .",

The SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model has been used for decades and it is a recommended model for infectious diseases that have an incubation period [6] . Once we have a model able to simulate the behaviour of the pandemic over the population, we can simulate the evolution of the virus for a given action. By doing so, we can answer questions like, for example, What is going to happen if we take action A or B? or, What percentage of people will be infected after three weeks of taking action A? We can also estimate how the taken actions will affect the economy of the country by the number of people that will lose their job or the number of companies that will have to close down [7] .",

The problem consists of solving which is the optimal policy, i.e., to take the best action for each state. There is a Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Q-Learning highly recommendable for finding the optimal policy. In particular, due to the high number of states in coronavirus simulations, we implemented Deep Q-Learning (DQL). DQL is a version of Q-Learning, very suitable for simulations, that approximates the Q- Table with an Artificial Neural Network [9] . The optimal policy is the one that takes actions over time and gets the highest accumulative reward. Additionally, we also implemented an approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) [10] , where individual chromosomes represent the sequences of possible actions. The implemented SEIR model is relatively simple because our contribution in this research is neither to make a perfect model to represent the COVID-19 pandemic nor to generate an accurate model for any specific country. Our main contribution is to propose a methodology based on DQL and GA to facilitate governments taking the best actions for an epidemiological pandemic. To our knowledge it has not being presented yet a paper on that specific topic before.",

As can be seen in Figure 1 , most individuals start in group S, then they move to group E when they contract the disease. After the incubation period, they become part of the next group, I, in which they are able to transmit it, and finally, after the transmission period, they move to the recovered group R, either because they overcome the disease or because they died of it and are not able to transmit it [14] .

Specifically, we implement the formula pattern = \"\u02c60 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 0 * $\" with regular expressions that only accepts the following chains. Chains of zeros, followed by chains of ones, threes, and zeros, where each chain has a size of zero or more. Thus, we add the following restriction: \"If a day does not fit the pattern of the regular expression, then the reward for that day onward goes to -10\".
