This pest is also widespread and highly invasive; thus, it is a high priority for pest detection and quarantine programs. Although Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy adult and third-instar larvae can usually be identi\u00deed and distinguished from other species by morphological keys, it is often dif\u00decult or impossible to identify or distinguish this species from other tephritids by using material from other stages of development. In such situations, use of a molecular technique known as loop-mediated isothermal ampli\u00decation (LAMP) would be valuable as a rapid and robust alternative species diagnostic tool. This method uses isothermal conditions and requires only relatively inexpensive equipment. In this study we have developed a simple and rapid procedure that combines a Chelex-based DNA extraction procedure with LAMP to rapidly detect the presence of Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy DNA and discriminate it from other species, by using material from different stages of development. Amounts of DNA as little as that recovered from a single egg were shown to be adequate for the analysis, and LAMP itself required only 45 min to complete.",

It is considered to be one of the world\u00d5s most widespread and damaging pests, and areas that are currently free of this pest heavily emphasize quarantine procedures designed to keep it from invading new agriculturally sensitive localities (Fimiani 1989) . For traditional detection procedures, Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy material from adult or third-instar stages of development can be identi\u00deed by morphological keys. However, morphological keys either do not exist or are not adequate to identify and/or distinguish different tephritid species by using material from earlier stages of the life cycle Elson-Harris 1992, Frias et al. 2008) . This is especially problematic for quarantining protocols because fruit infestations detected at ports-of-entry often include egg-and early larval-stage material. For this reason, the development of a rapid and robust method for species identi\u00decation that can be applied to material from these early (or any of the) life stages is necessary.",

This method is rapid and robust, and it requires only a simple thermostat-based instrument for operation under isothermal conditions. The am-pli\u00decation reaction uses speci\u00decally designed pairs of primers and a DNA polymerase (such as BstDNA polymerase) that has strand displacement activity. Recent work using this technique has also shown that the addition of an extra pair of primers can improve the method by reducing by half the time required for ampli\u00decation (Nagamine et al. 2002) .",

This may be because in general, LAMP seems to be less sensitive to the presence of nontarget DNA or reaction inhibitors compared with other ampli\u00decation methods (Notomi et al. 2000, Soliman and El-Matbouli 2005) . Regardless, our results support the use of the Chelex method for DNA extraction because it is the least expensive and nearly the fastest. This may be most relevant in situations where the rapid detection of pest infestations is required to implement quarantine procedures in a timely manner. Furthermore, using the Chelex-extracted material, our reactions were successful whether or not the DNA was quanti\u00deed before use in LAMP.",

Using the Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy primers, after a 30-min time interval, LAMP reaction products were clearly observed only when the Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy material was used as the template (Fig. 5) . Further checking at later time points (35 and 40 min) also con\u00dermed that products were seen only in the Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy lane, although when greatly extended reaction times of 90 min or more were checked, products were seen in the other lanes (data not shown).

In other molecular applications, the use of the highly conserved rDNA sequences requires much more detailed analysis to allow for differentiation between species in this family. However, additional testing will be required to see if the Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy can be differentiated from other species that are even more closely related species (for example species belonging to the same genus) using this method. To facilitate this, LAMP may be applied in a stepwise manner beginning with conserved sequences from genes such as the ribosomal genes described here to \u00derst make genus level identi\u00decations. This could then be followed up with a second round of LAMP reactions by using primers derived from other genes with greater power to discriminate between even closely related species, such as those described by Naeole and Haymer (2003) for identi\u00decation of species with the B. dorsalis complex. Alternatively, the LAMP results could be combined with other diagnostic tools, such as those described by Armstrong et al. (1997) to identify critical pest species.",

LAMP has the advantage that it requires only relatively simple equipment for isothermal ampli\u00decation and analysis of the target material. We also show here that using a simple and rapid Chelex-based DNA extraction procedure, minimal amounts of material from the Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy, such as single egg or body parts including the pupal theca, can be successfully detected. Results of LAMP also can be observed using either gel electrophoresis or visual detection when SYBR Green I is incorporated. Finally, because the entire process from the extraction of DNA to the identi\u00decation of the presence of material from a particular species (such as the Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy analyzed here) can be completed in a relatively short time (\u03fd1 h), this methodology may be extremely valuable for countries or regions subject to infestations of the Mediterranean fruit \u00dfy (or other pests) where decisions about implementations of quarantine procedures need to be made rapidly to maintain pestfree status.",
