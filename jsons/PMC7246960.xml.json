Ophthalmologists have been identified as being at significant risk of becoming infected with coronavirus because of the close proximity to patients and transmission via mucous membranes [1, 2]. It is therefore imperative to protect staff with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and prevent spread from patients. Exposure time and risk of cross infections need to be minimised by assessing and changing patterns of workflow [3]. One of the most severely affected areas outside China was Italy, where two centres described changes made to reduce patient flow by postponing deferrable activities and adopting telephone screening [4].",

It is typically performed in a small enclosed room, standing close to the patient for a period of time and handing occluder equipment to-and-fro. Recent recommendations have therefore suggested that it should be omitted whenever possible to reduce transmission risk. However, relying on subjective changes in vision reported by the patient alone could lead to additional investigation and inappropriate treatment. By incorporating this new technique of visual acuity measurement using a real-time virtual platform, objective changes in visual acuity can be identified with reduced risk of disease transmission and patients managed more appropriately.",

The consultation and acuity test are conducted in a real-time virtual manner (Fig. 1). The patient is instructed in the use of the occluder and pinhole, if required, which is placed conveniently in front of them within easy reach. The patient is asked to read the visual acuity chart directly ahead of them. The clinician can see if the occluder is being used correctly through the video link and has an electronic image of the current chart on his phone to allow them to assess the patient\u2019s performance and direct them accordingly. Visual acuity is measured in the standard manner under photopic conditions at 4 m of distance with the logMAR chart.",

They were attending for booked treatment of age-related macular degeneration or emergency attendance if they felt their vision had deteriorated since appointments had been cut back for other conditions such as diabetic macular oedema. The consultations have been done by one of two doctors or an optometrist. Clinical staff have reported that they are able to establish rapport easily without need for their mask and could take their time to discuss and allay fears. All patients were able to understand the requirements of them, having being very used to regular vision checks and they appeared to adapt well to the new technique. In the current climate, many of the patients tested may otherwise have not had formal visual acuity assessment and clinicians reported benefits of the extra information gleaned in terms of reassurance to patient and impact on decisions for retreatment period. In one emergency case, full and lengthy discussion with a patient and accurate vision test prevented the need for full slit lamp exam and further appointment. Feedback received from patients suggests that it is an acceptable means of communication with them. They feel reassured that social distancing is maintained, are more likely to attend their appointment and therefore maintain their vision.",

Because of the distance between the patient and doctor, the wearing of a face mask may be optional. If not worn, it allows patients to see the whole of the doctor\u2019s face. As the demographic of patients treated have a higher prevalence of hearing issues, this can aid significantly in the communication between the patient and doctor.
