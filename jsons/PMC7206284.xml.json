            "text": "Medical image segmentation is the key to determining whether medical images can provide a reliable basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, the borders between tissues in medical images may be blurred by the imaging acquisition, which increases the difficulty on segmentation. The classical CNN (non-fully convolutional networks) such as [18] and Residual connections network (Res-Net) [6] can only classify separate examples and not a whole segmented pixel, because the fully connected layers are used at the end of the network, which can only mark the category of the whole image and not per pixel. Nevertheless, in many medical imaging tasks, especially in medical segmentation, a class label is desired to be assigned to each pixel. The breakthrough by Ciresan et al. [3] was due to sliding-window setup which can predict the class label of each pixel by providing a local context (neighbor region) around that pixel as input. They won the EM segmentation challenge at ISBI 2012.",

[3] has some limitations: (1) it needs a long time to process the training image because the network must be run for each neighbor region, and there is a slight redundancy due to overlapping between the neighboring regions. (2) it is hard to keep balance in context and localization accuracy. Smaller neighbor regions make the network see context weakly, while larger neighbor regions need more pooling layers that reduce the localization accuracy. Fully convolutional network (FCN) uses the convolutional layer to replace the fully connected layer, getting the probability of each pixel rather than the scalar of the whole image, which improves the accuracy of segmentation [17]. Moreover, the advantage of FCN is indeed the possibility to have a whole image and its segmentation as training inputs, rather than feeding all possible separate sub-images centered on each labelled pixel like the strategy in Ciresan et al. [3].",

The network has a contracting path and an expanding path that is more or less symmetric to the contracting path, yielding an architecture like letter U. In the expanding path, pooling operators are replaced by upsampling operators to increase the resolution of the output, making the high resolution features from the contracting path combined with the upsampling output through the skip connections, which allows the network to learn more precise feature based on this information. However, the U-Net architecture has one drawback that is difficult to improve performance by shallowing or deepening its depth. Technically, the network with deeper depth is supposed to learn more features and results in better segmentation, while gradients may vanish during the training period, making the network hard to train [8, 20].",

Residual Block (RB) [6] and Dense Block (DB) [7] are widely integrated into U-Net due to their scalability. And they can also make it is easy to train the network with deep depth, enabling the network to learn more represented information. Furthermore, the concatenation in Dense-Net makes the final classifier use features from all previous layers (different from classical CNN approaches), resulting in better performance of classification.

It integrates Residual Block (RB) [6] and Dense Block (DB) [7] into the inception architecture [20], aiming to excel in accuracy with fewer parameters. The exploration of our network consists of four steps. First, we choose ten layers (including the pooling layers, the convolutional layers, the upsampling layers) as a backbone of the network. Secondly, we try to add RBs as functional modules to the up-down sampling path, and the positions of blocks are discussed through experiments. Thirdly, the backbone is equipped with two DBs when the best positions of RBs are determined. We combine two DBs with RBs, getting two Mini-Inception-Residual-Dense Blocks (MIRD) to replace two RBs which are located in downsampling path. Finally, the pooling layers are replaced with \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$3\\times 3$$\\end{document} convolutional layers.

Pooling layers as a basic module are widely used in CNNs, which can enlarge the Receptive Field (RF) to make network get more effective information during the training period. However, Pooling operations also lose some spatial information due to reducing the size of images. Theoretically, we cannot remove pooling layers and enlarge the size of convolutional kernels directly, because the larger kernel would result in increasing computational consumption. The larger kernel can be replaced by multiple smaller kernel, keeping the parameter low, which can be seen as imposing a regularization on the larger kernel [18].

Yu. F et al. [22] used the dilated convolution to replace the pooling operation, which has two advantages. First, it can enlarge the RF without losing information like the pooling operation. Secondly, it can be applied in well situations where the image requires global information. Conditional Random Field (CRF) has been used in the field of image segmentation since 2011 [11]. Later, the CRF was added as a functional module to the back end of the neural network to optimize the segmentation result [23].",

The Residual Blocks in different positions of up-downsampling path can affect the performance of the network. RSU(35810) (Fig. 2(a)) performs best in all four RSU-Nets we discussed and outperforms U-Net in six datasets. Moreover, it can be seen that there is obvious improvement by MIRD-Net, which achieves elegant results. The parameters of MIRD-Net are only about 1/50 of U-net (Table 3), which saves the storage memory.\n",

The new network takes advantage of Inception, Res-Net and Dense-Net, outperforming U-Net in six different image segmentation tasks. Its parameters are only about 1/50 of U-Net. Furthermore, the MIRD Block of our proposed architecture can also be simply added to other backbones as a functional module. The shortcoming is the way to select the position of MIRD Block, and we have not proven that the position of MIRD Block is the best choice in theory. In the future, the research would focus on the relevance between performance and the position of MIRD Block in different backbones, finding a better strategy to determine the position of MIRD Block and simplifying this structure.",
