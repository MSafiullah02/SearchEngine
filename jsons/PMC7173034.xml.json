As well, the relative effectiveness of the N95 compared to other mask types hasbeen entertained. A recent article by Abd-Elsayed and Karri1 aim to put these topics into focus. In addition, personal correspondence between Drs Richard Prielipp (University of Minnesota Department of Anesthesiology) and Peter Tsai (inventor of the N95 mask) offers perspectives on managing the reuse of this central element of protective equipment.",
