            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus belonging to the genus Gammacoronavirus, is the major cause of contagious respiratory disease or infectious bronchitis in poultry. Many IBV serotypes have been isolated so far and some serotypes induce pathological changes in organs other than the respiratory tissues [1]. This variable tissue tropism is likely due to tissue-specific factors resulting in differences in binding or entry of the virus. Although a specific protein receptor for IBV is yet to be revealed it has been shown by removing sialic acids from the susceptible cell surface, that \u03b12, 3-linked sialic acids are a determinant of cell attachment and entry of IBV [2, 3]. Further elucidation of host\u2013virus interactions is, however, hampered due to limitations in in vitro infection model systems for pathogenic IBV strains.",

By swapping the gene encoding for spike protein between different IBV serotypes it has been shown that the spike determines the tissue tropism [4]. The spike protein is cleaved into an S1 and an S2 subunit [5, 6]; while S1 mediates the first step in infection via the initial virus\u2013cell binding, S2 is responsible for cell entry [7]. Analyzing the binding of S1 to tissues with our protein histochemistry protocol enables us not only to profile the attachment of avian coronavirus S1 proteins to various avian tissues but also to elucidate glycan binding specificities of IBV S1 [8] as well as determinants within S1 for tissue attachment [9]. Thereby, this method aids to understand the in vivo tissue tropism of avian coronaviruses.",

The solution should be continuously stirred at 50\u201360 \u00b0C and when it is completely dissolved, filter-sterilize, aliquot, and store at \u221220 \u00b0C. The efficiency of PEI for transfecting HEK 293T cells with DNA is tested by using PEI ratios from 1:5 to 1:20. The number of transfected cells is counted using a fluorescence microscope under 10\u00d7 magnification. The best ratio to use for subsequent transfection is the ratio that gives the highest percentage (usually 40 %) of transfected cells with lowest toxicity or cell death.Tissues that easily detach during antigen retrieval, including for example trachea, can be mounted onto KP plus slides to reduce the tissue damage.Concentration gradient ensures reaching the optimum amount of lectins required for complete blocking of the binding of recombinant proteins.By seeding 1 \u00d7 107 cells per T175 flask we were able to reach 50\u201360 % confluence after 24 h post seeding. When compared to <50 % or >60 % cell confluence, transfection at 50\u201360 % confluence results in a significantly higher transfection efficiency and thereby higher amounts of recombinant proteins.Proteins in the supernatant (using 5\u201310 \u03bcl) are analyzed using SDS PAGE followed by western blotting to determine whether the protein is properly produced. In particular we check for any degradation, low or no expression and correct molecular weight (IBV S1 protein is highly glycosylated and migrates around 110 kDa). Upon high amounts of protein in the culture supernatant (usually appearing as thick bands of \u22655 mm in the film) we add 250 \u03bcl of 50 % Strep-Tactin sepharose suspension for each 10 ml of supernatant. However, compared to column-based purification minor fraction of proteins were lost with the supernatant after purification with the beads. If necessary, column based purification can be done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Since the beads tend to stick on to the surface of the tube, it is important not to disturb the sediment after centrifugation and while transferring to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube. If necessary, to recover more beads from the surface of the tube add PBS for another one or two times, but limit the total volume to no more than 1.8 ml to prevent spilling of the beads while closing the Eppendorf tube.For every 250 \u03bcl of 50 % Strep-Tactin sepharose suspension we use 125 \u03bcl of elution buffer. Whenever we obtained low protein yields (<4 mg/ml) the proteins were concentrated using Vivaspin according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.We use \u22652 \u03bcl of purified proteins to measure the concentrations in Qubit fluorimeter. We also approximated the protein concentrations compared to a BSA standard after GelCode Blue/Coomassie staining of a SDS PAGE gel.Performing antigen retrieval in the microwave can destroy some tissues (for example tracheal epithelium and cartilage). In such instances transfer the glass slides into a polypropylene Coplin jar filled with citrate buffer, cover with a lid, and keep in a water bath preheated to 80 \u00b0C for 45 min.Since Strep-Tactin HRP is optimized only for western blotting different lots may complex to a different extent with spike proteins. Therefore, every lot number has to be tested using a prior lot number giving positive signals. Moreover, the amount of Strep-Tactin HRP to the total volume (1:200) was optimized for IBV-S1, and has to be optimized accordingly when using a recombinant protein with different molecular weight.Wear gloves when handling AEC. Apply AEC in a fume hood and discard safely the water drained with AEC. For large tissue sections a coverslip can be used to spread AEC drops gently over the tissues, thus minimizing the required amounts of AEC to sufficiently cover tissues.We used both Vibrio cholera neuraminidase and Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase. Compared to Vibrio cholera neuraminidase, Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase showed more efficient cleaving of sialic acids from tissues embedded in paraffin. It is important to apply sufficient volume of total fluid to prevent drying off the tissues during incubation at 37 \u00b0C.\n",
