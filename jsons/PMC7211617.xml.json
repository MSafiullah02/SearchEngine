            "text": "While not relevant for short meetings of perhaps less than 90 minutes, during those lasting for a half day or longer, we believe it is important to build in breaks within the virtual meeting agenda. It can be even more difficult to concentrate when participating in remote discussions compared to face-to-face interactions, particularly for the chair who is denied non-verbal communication clues and other committee dynamics that can help the effective running of meetings. Lack of concentration can lead to agenda items being missed, or improperly understood and discussed in a similar way to loss of situational awareness leading to potential error.8 Furthermore, it is much harder for committee members to look out for each other or prompt the chair if they are missing something important or going off track. We recommend a minimum 10-minute break every 90 minutes, with a longer break of at least 20 minutes after three hours. Participants can remain logged or connected in to the hosting platform or dial in number. During this time, just as in clinical practice, it is important to rehydrate and eat regularly.9 A cup of coffee and comfort break may make longer virtual meetings more enjoyable than shorter but more intense face-to-face meeting where breaks and drinks are considered unnecessary (Fig. 1\n).",
