            "text": "In recent years, mechanics has experienced a revival, as microfabrication technologies and nanotechnology are applied to produce tiny structures. The development of ultraprecise position sensing started three decades ago with a novel imaging technique called atomic force microscopy, which provides ultrahigh topography resolution on the atomic scale by raster-scanning the surface with a microfabricated cantilever beam that has a tiny tip at its free end. The high force sensitivity can not only be used for imaging, but also allows the measurement of surface forces during molecule adsorption processes on the cantilever surface, thus enabling cantilevers to act as chemical sensors. Because of their small size, cantilevers allow fast and reliable detection of small concentrations of molecules in air and solution. In addition to artificial nose and label-free biosensing applications, they have also been employed to measure physical properties of tiny amounts of materials in miniaturized versions of conventional standard techniques such as calorimetry, thermogravimetry, weighing, photothermal spectroscopy and monitoring of chemical reactions. In the past few years, the cantilever-sensor concept has been extended to medical applications and has entered clinics for pilot studies on patients. The small size and scalability of cantilever array sensors might turn out to be advantageous for diagnostic screening applications and disease monitoring, as well as for genomics or proteomics. Using microcantilever arrays allows simultaneous detection of several analytes and solves the inherent problem of thermal drifts often present when using single microcantilever sensors, as some of the cantilevers can be used as sensor cantilevers for detection, and others as passivated reference cantilevers that do not show affinity to the molecules to be detected.

            "text": "Sensors are devices that detect, or sense, changes in the environment and produce a measurable output signal. Moreover, a sensor is also a transducer, i. e., it transforms one form of energy into another. Most people will associate sensors with electrical or electronic devices that respond by a signal change when an external physical parameter is changed. Many more types of transducers exist, such as electrochemical (pH probe), electromechanical (piezoelectric actuator, quartz, strain gauge), electroacoustic (gramophone pick-up, microphone), photoelectric (photodiode, solar cell), electromagnetic (antenna), magnetic (Hall-effect sensor, hard-disk head for storage applications), electrostatic (electrometer), thermoelectric (thermocouple, thermoresistors), and electrical (capacitor, resistor). Here we focus on a further type of sensor not yet mentioned: the mechanical sensor. It responds to changes of an external parameter, such as temperature variations or molecule adsorption, by a mechanical response, e.g., by bending or deflection.",

            "text": "Mechanical sensors consist of a fixed and a movable part. The movable part can be a thin membrane, a plate or a beam, fixed at one or both ends. The structures described here are called cantilevers. A cantilever is defined here as a microfabricated rectangular bar-shaped structure that is longer than it is wide and has a thickness that is much smaller than its length or width. It is a horizontal structural element supported only at one end on a chip body; the other end is free ( Fig. 15.1 ). Most often it is used as a mechanical probe to image the topography of a sample in a technique called atomic force microscopy (AFM) or scanning force mi- (1) rigid chip body, (2) solid cantilever support structure, (3) hinge of cantilever, (4) upper surface of the cantilever that is usually functionalized with a sensor layer for detection of molecules, (5) lower surface of the cantilever, usually passivated in order not to show affinity to the molecules to be detected. The geometrical dimensions, length l, width w and thickness t, are indicated croscopy (SFM) [15.1] , invented by Binnig et al. in the mid 1980s [15.1] . For AFM a microfabricated sharp tip is located at the apex of the cantilever that serves as a local probe to scan the sample surface. The distance between tip and surface is controlled via sensitive measurement of interatomic forces in the piconewton range. By scanning the tip across a conductive or nonconductive surface using an x-y-z actuator system (e.g., a piezoelectric scanner), an image of the topography is obtained by recording for all positions x and y the correction signal that has to be applied to the z-actuation drive to keep the interaction between tip and sample surface constant. SFM methods are well established in scientific research, education and, to a certain extent, also in industry. Beyond imaging of surfaces, cantilevers have been used for many other purposes, e.g., structuring of surfaces. Here, we focus on the application as mechanical sensor devices, responding by mechanical bending or change in resonance frequency.",

            "text": "The idea to use beams of silicon as sensors to measure deflections or changes in resonance frequency is actually quite old. First reports go back to 1968, when Wilfinger et al. [15.2] investigated silicon cantilever structures of 50 mm 30 mm 8 mm, i. e., quite large cantilever beams, for detecting resonances. On the one hand, they took advantage of localized thermal expansion in diffused resistors (piezoresistors) located near the cantilever support to create a temperature gradient to actuate the cantilever at its resonance frequency. On the other hand, the piezoresistors have also been used to sense mechanical deflection of the cantilever. This early report already contains essential concepts for sensing and actuation of cantilevers. In the following years only a few reports were published on the use of cantilevers as sensors, e.g., Heng [15.3] , who fabricated in 1971 gold cantilevers capacitively coupled to microstrip lines for mechanical trimming of high-frequency oscillator circuits. In 1979, Petersen [15.4] constructed cantilever-type micromechanical membrane switches in silicon that should have filled the gap between silicon transistors and mechanical electromagnetic relays. Kolesar [15.5] suggested the use of cantilever structures as electronic nerve agent detectors in 1985.",

[15.6] presented a cantilever coated with a thin film of zinc oxide and proposed a piezoresistive deflection readout as an alternative to the optical beam Part C | 15.2 deflection readout. Cleveland et al. [15.7] reported the tracking of cantilever resonance frequency to detect nanogram changes in mass loading when small particles were deposited onto AFM probe tips. Thundat et al. [15.8] showed that the resonance frequency as well as static bending of microcantilevers (MCs) are influenced by ambient conditions, such as moisture adsorption, and that deflection of metal-coated cantilevers can be further influenced by thermal effects (bimetallic effect). First chemical sensing applications were presented by Gimzewski et al. [15.9] , who used static cantilever bending to detect chemical reactions with very high sensitivity. Later Thundat et al. [15. 10] observed changes in the resonance frequency of microcantilevers due to adsorption of analyte vapor on exposed surfaces. Furthermore, frequency changes have been observed caused by mass loading or adsorption-induced changes in cantilever spring constant. By coating cantilever surfaces with hygroscopic materials, such as phosphoric acid or gelatin, the cantilever can sense water vapor with picogram mass resolution.",

The upper or lower surface of the cantilever serves as the sensor area and allows the processes taking place on the cantilever beam to be monitored with unprecedented accuracy, in particular the adsorption of molecules. The formation of molecule layers on the cantilever surface will generate surface stress, eventually resulting in a bending of the cantilever, provided the adsorption preferentially occurs on one of the surfaces of the cantilever. Adsorption is controlled by coating one surface (typically the upper one) of a cantilever with a thin layer of a material that shows affinity to molecules in the environment (sensor surface). This surface of the cantilever is referred to as the functionalized surface. The other surface of the cantilever (typically the lower one) may be left uncoated or be coated with a passivation layer, i. e., a chemical surface that does not exhibit substantial affinity to the molecules from the environment we would like to detect. To create functionalized surfaces, often a metal layer is evaporated onto the area to be used as the sensor surface. Metal surfaces, e.g., gold, may be used to covalently bind a monolayer representing the chemical surface sensitive to the molecules to be detected from environment. Frequently, a monolayer of thiol molecules is used, which is covalently bound to a gold surface. The gold layer is also favorable for use as a reflection layer if the bending of the cantilever is read out via an optical beam deflection method.",

We will call this process development of compressive surface stress, because the surface stress change associated with the formation of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) produces forces stretching laterally the adsorbed layer, resulting in a downward bending of the cantilever (away from the gold coating). In the opposite situation, i. e., when the cantilever bends upwards, we would speak of tensile stress. If both upper and lower surfaces of the cantilevers are involved in the reaction, then the situation will be much more complex, as a predominant compressive stress formation on the lower cantilever surface might appear as tensile stress on the upper surface. For this reason, it is of utmost importance that the lower cantilever surface is passivated in such a way that ideally no processes will take place on the lower surface of the cantilever.",

The measurement of static deflection upon formation of surface stress during adsorption of a molecular layer is termed static mode.

Surface stress-induced bending of cantilevers during the adsorption of alkanethiols on gold was reported by Berger et al. in 1997 [15.13] . The mode corresponding to the technique of noncontact AFM is termed dynamic mode, where a cantilever is oscillated at its resonance frequency, and was described by Cleveland et al. [15.7] . They calculated mass changes from shifts in the cantilever resonance frequency upon the mounting of tiny tungsten particle spheres at the apex of the cantilever. Not only adsorption effects can provoke cantilever bending, but also thermal effects. The so-called heat mode was pioneered by Gimzewski et al. [15.9] , who took advantage of the bimetallic effect that produces bending of a metal-coated cantilever when heat is generated on its surface. Therewith they constructed a miniaturized calorimeter with picojoule sensitivity. Further operating modes exploit other physical effects such as the production of heat from the absorption of light by materials deposited on the cantilever (photothermal spectroscopy) [15. 14], or cantilever bending due to electric or magnetic forces.",

Static mode operation has been reported in various environments. In its simplest configuration, molecules from gaseous environments adsorb on the functionalized sensing surface and form a molecular layer ( Fig. 15 .3a), provided the molecules exhibit at least some affinity to the surface. In case of alkanethiol covalently binding to gold, the affinity is very high, resulting in a fast bending response within minutes [15.13] . A less specific way of detection takes advantage of the penetrable network of polymer layers. Polymer sensing layers only exhibit a partial sensitivity, i. e., polymercoated cantilevers always respond to the presence of volatile molecules, but the magnitude and temporal behavior are specific to the chemistry of the polymer. Molecules from the environment diffuse into the polymer layer at different rates, mainly depending on the size and solubility of the molecules in the polymer layer (Fig. 15.3b) . A wide range of hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymers can be selected as sensing layers, differing in their affinity to polar and unpolar molecules. Thus, polymer coatings can be chosen ac-cording to the respective requirements of the sensing application.",

Cantilevers functionalized by coating with biochemical sensing layers respond very specifically using the biomolecular key-lock principles of molecular recognition. Whether molecular recognition will actually lead to bending of the cantilever will depend on the efficiency of transduction, as the surface stress has to be generated very close to the cantilever surface to produce substantial bending. By just scaling down standard gene chip strategies to cantilever geometry through utilization of long spacer molecules, hybridization takes place at a distance of several nanometers away from the cantilever surface. The original idea to make DNA molecules become more accessible for hybridization in a gene chip configuration, is unfavorable for cantileverbased sensing through surface stress detection, as the magnitude of bending is greatly reduced or not even observable [15. 18].",

This size has to be selected in such a way that all eight laser beams pass through the lens close to its center to minimize scattering, chromatic and spherical aberration artifacts. The light is then reflected off the gold-coated surface of the cantilever and hits the surface of a PSD. PSDs are light-sensitive photo-potentiometerlike devices that produce photocurrents at two opposing electrodes. The magnitude of the photocurrents depends linearly on the distance of the impinging light spot from the electrodes. Thus, the position of an incident light beam can easily be determined with micrometer precision. The photocurrents are transformed into voltages and amplified in a preamplifier. As only one PSD is used, the eight laser light sources cannot be switched on simultaneously. Therefore, a time-multiplexing procedure is used to switch the lasers on and off sequentially at typical intervals of 10 100 ms. The resulting deflection signal is digitized and stored together with time information on a personal computer (PC), which also controls the multiplexing of the VCSELs as well as the switching of the valves and mass flow controllers used for setting the composition ratio of the analyte mixture.",

The current flowing between the two branches of the Wheatstone bridge is initially nulled by changing the resistance of the adjustable resistor. If the cantilever bends, the piezoresistor changes its value and a current will flow between the two branches of the Wheatstone bridge. This current is converted via a differential amplifier into a voltage for static mode measurement. For dynamic mode measurement, the piezoresistive cantilever is externally actuated via a frequency generator connected to a piezocrystal.

            "text": "A microcantilever-based alcohol vapor sensor was described in [15.94] . It used the piezoresistive technique and a polymer coating. The authors also presented a simple evaporation model that allowed determination of concentration. The detection limit found was 10 ppm for methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol. In [15.95] , an integrated complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chemical microsensor with piezoresistive detection (Wheatstone bridge configuration) using poly(etherurethane) (PEUT) as the sensor layer was presented. The authors were able to reversibly detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as toluene, n-octane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol with a sensitivity level down to 200 ppm. An improved version of that device was described in [15.96] . The sensitivity was increased to 5 ppm for n-octane. Later, the technique was refined using electromagnetic rather than electrothermal actuation and a transistor-based readout reducing power dissipation on the cantilever [15.97] . Piezoelectric readout in dynamic mode and electromagnetic actuation of cantilevers spray-coated with PEUT was reported in [15.98] , which achieved a sensitivity of 14 ppm for ethanol. In [15. 99], a study on how to prepare polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated microcantilever sensors using a microcapillary pipette-assisted method was reported. The PEG coating is suitable for ethanol sensing as ethanol quickly forms hydrogen bonds with the OH groups of the PEG. Sensor operation was reported to be reversible and reproducible. In [15. 100], artificial neural networks were used for analyte species and concentration identification with polymer-coated optically read-out microcantilevers. The analytes detected were carbon dioxide, dichloromethane, diisopropylmethylphosphonate (DIMP), dioxane, ethanol, water, 2-propanol, methanol, trichloroethylene, and trichloromethylene. In [15.101] , the chemical sensing performance of a silicon resonant microcantilever sensor was investigated in dependence on the thickness of the sensitive coating. For a coating thickness of 1, 4, and 21 m of PEUT a limit of detection of 30 ppm was found for ethanol. A new concept of a parylene micromembrane array for chemical sensing was presented in [15. 102] using the capacitive method. The parylene membrane was suspended over a metal pad patterned on the substrate. The pad and part of the membrane that was metal-coated served as electrodes for capacitive measurement. The top electrode located on the membrane was chemically modified by application of a gold layer and self-assembled thiol monolayers ( COOH, CH 3 and OH) for detection of analyte molecules. Successful detection of 2-propanol and toluene was reported. In [15.103] , a sensitive self-oscillating cantilever array was described for quantitative and qualitative analysis of organic vapor mixtures. The cantilevers were electromagnetically actuated and the resonance frequency was measured using a frequency counter. Sensor response was reproducible and reversible. Using a PEUT coating the smallest measured concentration was 400 ppm, but the limit of detection was well below 1 ppm. In [15. 104], a combination of gas chromatography with a microcantilever sensor array for enhanced selectivity was reported. Test VOC mixtures composed of acetone, ethanol, and trichloroethylene in pentane, as well as methanol with acetonitrile in pentane were first separated in a gas chromatography column and then detected using microcantilevers coated with responsive phases such as 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane, copper phtalocyanine, and methyl-\u02c7-cyclodextrin. Analytes detected included pentane, methanol, acetonitrile, acetone, ethanol, and trichloroethylene. In [15.105] , results were presented on independent component analysis (ICA) of ethanol, propanol, and DIMP using a cantilever coated with molecular recognition phases (MRP), whereby ICA proved its feature extraction ability for components in mixtures.",

            "text": "Explosives, Chemical Warfare, and Biohazards Security measures require inexpensive, highly selective and very sensitive small sensors that can be massproduced and microfabricated. Such low-cost sensors could be arranged as a sensor grid for large area coverage of sensitive infrastructure, such as airports, public buildings, or traffic infrastructure. Threats may be of chemical, biological, radioactive, or explosive nature. Microcantilever sensors are reported to offer very high sensitivities for explosives detection. Photomechanical chemical microsensors based on adsorption-induced and photo-induced stress changes due to the presence of diisopropyl methyl phosphonate (DIMP), which is a model compound for phosphorous-containing chemical warfare agents, and trinitrotoluene (TNT), an explosive, were reported [15.107] . Further explosives frequently used include pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), often also with plastic fillers [15.108] . These compounds are very stable, if no detonator is present. Their explosive power, however, is very large, and moreover, the vapor pressures of PETN and RDX are very low, in the range of ppb and ppt. By functionalizing microcantilevers with self-assembled monolayers of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) PETN was detected at a level of 1400 ppt and RDX at a level of 290 ppt [15.109] . TNT was found to readily stick to Si surfaces, suggesting the use of microcantilevers for TNT detection, taking advantage of the respective adsorption/desorption kinetics [15.110, 111] . Detection of TNT via deflagration on a microcantilever was described by Pinnaduwage et al. [15.111] . They used piezoresistive microcantilevers where the cantilever deflection was measured optically via beam deflection. TNT vapor from a generator placed 5 mm away from the microcantilever was observed to adsorb on its surface resulting in a decrease of resonance frequency. Application of an electrical pulse (10 V, 10 ms) to the piezoresistive cantilever resulted in deflagration of the TNT vapor and a bump in the cantilever bending signal. This bump was found to be related to the heat produced during deflagration. The amount of heat released is proportional to the area of the bump in the time versus bending signal diagram of the process. The deflagration was found to be complete, as the same resonance frequency as before the experiment was observed. The amount of TNT mass involved was determined as 50 pg. The technique was later extended to the detection of PETN and RDX, where much slower reaction kinetics was observed [15.109, 112] . Traces of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) in TNT can also be used for detection of TNT, because it is the major impurity in production-grade TNT. Furthermore, DNT is a decomposition product of TNT. The saturation concentration of DNT in air at 20 \u0131 C is 25 times higher than that of TNT. DNT was reported detectable at the 300 ppt level using polysiloxane polymer layers [15.113] . Microfabrication of electrostatically actuated resonant microcantilever beams in CMOS technology for detection of the nerve agent stimulant dimethylmethylphosphonate (DMMP) using polycarbosilane-coated beams [15.114] is an important step towards an integrated platform based on silicon microcantilevers, which besides compactness might also include telemetry [15.115] . Cu 2C /l-cysteine bilayercoated microcantilever demonstrated high sensitivity and selectivity toward organo-phosphorus compounds in aqueous solution. The microcantilever was found to undergo bending upon exposure to nerve agent simulant DMMP at concentrations as low as 10 15 M due to the complexation of the phosphonyl group and the Cu 2C /lcysteine bilayer on the microcantilever surface [15.116, 117 ].",

SiO 2 and silicon nitride microcantilevers were also found to exhibit a deflection dependency with pH when coated with 4-aminobutyltriethoxysilane, 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and Au/Alcoated over a pH range between 2 and 12. Aminosilane-modified SiO 2 /Au cantilevers performed robustly over a pH range between 2 and 8 (49 nm deflection/pH unit), while Si 3 N 4 /Au cantilevers performed well at a pH between 2 and 6 as well as between 8 and 12 (30 nm deflection/pH unit) [15.118] . Microcantilevers with poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate coating were shown to be sensitive to pH changes [15.119] . Also hydrogel coatings were found to be sensitive to pH [15.120] .

            "text": "DNA, RNA Specific DNA hybridization detection was observed via surface stress changes related to transduction of receptor-ligand binding into a direct nanomechanical response of microfabricated cantilevers without the need for external labeling or amplification. The differential deflection of the cantilevers was found to provide a true molecular recognition signal despite large responses of individual cantilevers. Hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides shows that a single base mismatch between two 12-mer oligonucleotides is clearly detectable [15.17] . The findings were confirmed or modeled by several groups [15.127, 128] . Hybridization in a complex nonspecific background was observed in a complement concentration range between 75 nM and 2 M [15.50], following Lang-muir model kinetics [15.129] . Enzymatic processes were directly performed on a microcantilever functionalized with DNA incorporating a Hind III restriction endonuclease site, followed by digestion with Hind III to produce DNA comprising a single-stranded end on the cantilever surface. Ligase was used to couple a second DNA molecule with a compatible end to the DNA on the cantilever [15.130] . Using gold nanoparticle-labeled DNA, microcantilevers have been used to detect DNA strands with a specific sequence in dynamic mode, whereby a concentration of 23 pM could still be detected, as well as a single base pair mismatch [15.131] . Whereby adsorption of thiol-functionalized single-stranded DNA is easily observed, hybridization cannot be observed if long hydrocarbon spacer molecules between single-strand DNA and the thiol anchor are used [15.132] . DNA hybridization was also observed using piezoresistive cantilevers [15.129, 133] . A different technique to read out the microcantilever deflections in an array was reported in [15.134] . There the optical beam deflection technique was combined with the scanning of a laser beam illuminating the cantilevers of an array sequentially. DNA hybridization has also been reported using polymer SU-8 cantilevers [15.135] . Mukhopadhyay et al. reported 20 nM hybridization sensitivity using piezoresistive cantilevers and DNA sequences with an overhang extension distal to the surface [15.136] . A larger array comprising 20 microcantilevers was described in [15.137] . Moreover, the authors presented integration of the array with microfluidics. Surface stress changes in response to thermal dehybridization, or melting, has been reported [15.138] . The dependence of salt concentration and hybridization efficiency was discussed in [15.139] . Two different DNA-binding proteins, the transcription factors SP1 and NF-kappa B were investigated in [15.140] . Phase transition and stability issues of DNA were discussed in [15.141] . Differential gene expression of the gene 1-8U, a potential marker for cancer progression or viral infections, has been observed in a complex background. The measurements provided results within minutes at the picomolar level without target amplification, and were sensitive to base mismatches [15.142] .",

In [15. 144] the activity, stability, lifetime, and re-usability of monoclonal antibodies to myoglobin covalently immobilized onto microfabricated cantilever surfaces was investigated. Using piezoresistive microcantilevers the interaction of antibovine serum albumin (a-BSA) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied [15.145] . Continuous labelfree detection of two cardiac biomarker proteins (creatin kinase and myoglobin) has been demonstrated using an array of microfabricated cantilevers functionalized with covalently anchored anti-creatin kinase and anti-myoglobin antibodies [15.51] . Label-free protein detection has been reported using a microcantilever functionalized with DNA aptamer receptors for Taq DNA polymerase [15.146] . Label-free detection of Creactive protein (CRP) using resonant frequency shift in piezoresistive cantilevers was described in [15.147] , utilizing the specific binding characteristics of CRP antigen to its antibody, which is immobilized with Calixcrown SAMs on Au. In [15.148] , the authors discuss receptors on microcantilevers for serotonin that are insensitive to its biological precursor with a similar tryptophan structure. Using single-chain fragment antibodies instead of complete antibodies allowed the limit of detection to be lowered to concentrations of about 1 nM [15.149] . In [15.150] , detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and C-reactive protein was reported. Detection of the human oestrogen receptor in free and oestradiol-bound conformation can be distinguished [15.151] . The Ca 2C binding protein calmodulin changes its conformation in presence or absence of Ca 2C resulting in a microcantilever deflection change [15.152] . No effect was observed upon exposure to K C and Mg 2C . Detection of activated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was performed in dynamic mode employing a peptide derived from the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) in [15.153] . Detection of streptavidin at 1 10 nM concentration was reported using biotin-coated cantilevers in [15.154] . Using GST (glutathione-S-transferase) for detection of GST antibodies, a sensitivity of 40 nM was obtained [15.155] . A two-dimensional multiplexed real-time, label-free antibody-antigen binding assay by optically detecting nanoscale motions of two-dimensional arrays of microcantilever beams was presented in [15.156] . Prostatespecific antigen was detected at 1 ng=mL using antibodies covalently bound to one surface of the cantilevers. Conformational changes in membrane protein patches of bacteriorhodopsin proteoliposomes were observed with microcantilevers through prosthetic retinal removal (bleaching) [15.157] . Using an analog of the myc-tag decapeptide, binding of anti-myc-tag antibodies was reported [15.158] .",

            "text": "Gas sensing not only involves chemical detection, but also pressure and flow sensing. Brown et al. [15.177] studied the behavior of magnetically actuated oscillating microcantilevers at large deflections and found hysteresis behavior at resonance. The amplitude at the actuation frequency changes, depending on pressure due to damping. The authors used cantilever-incantilever (CIC) structures, and observed changes in deflection as gas pressure was varied. At atmospheric pressure, damping is large and the oscillation amplitude is relative small and hysteresis effects are absent. At lower pressure, abrupt changes in the oscillation amplitude occur with changes in the driving frequency. Since the change of amplitude and driving frequency, at which they occur is pressure dependent, these quantities can be used for accurate determination of gas pressure, demonstrated in the range between 10 3 and 10 2 mbar. Brown et al. [15. 178] emphasized that microelectromechanical system pressure sensors will have a wide range of applications, especially in the automotive industry. Piezoresistive-cantilever-based deflection measurement has major advantages over diaphragms. The pressure range has been extended to 15 1450 mbar by means of design geometry adaptation. Su et al. [15. 179] presented highly sensitive ultrathin piezoresistive silicon microcantilevers for gas velocity sensing, whereby the deflection increased with airflow distribution in a steel pipe. The detection principle was based on normal pressure drag producing bending of the cantilever. The minimum flow speed measured was 0:07 m=s, which is comparable to classical hot-wire anemometers. Mertens et al. [15.180] have investigated the effects of temperature and pressure on microcantilever resonance response in helium and nitrogen. Resonance response as a function of pressure showed three different regimes, which correspond to molecular flow, transition regimes and viscous flow, whereby the frequency variation of the cantilever is mainly due to changes in the mean free path of gas molecules. Effects observed allow measurement of pressures between 10 2 10 6 Pa. Mortet et al. [15.181] presented a pressure sensor based on a piezoelectric bimorph microcantilever with a measurement range between 0.1 and 8:5 bar. The resonance frequency shift was constant for pressures below 0:5 bar. For higher pressures the sensitivity was typically a few ppm=mbar, but depended on the mode number. Sievil\u00e4 et al. [15. 182] presented a cantilever paddle within a frame that operated like a moving mirror to detect displacements in the oscillating cantilever using a He/Ne laser in a Michelson interferometer configuration, whereby the cantilever acted as a moving mirror element in one path of the interferometer. A fixed mirror served as a reference in the other arm of the interferometer.",

The infrared (thermal) image of the source is obtained by rastering a single microfabricated cantilever across the image formed at the focal plane of a concave mirror [15.185-187] . The method was later refined such that photons are detected using the stress caused by photoelectrons emitted from a Pt film surface in contact with a semiconductor microstructure, which forms a Schottky barrier. The photo-induced bending of the Schottky barrier microstructure is due to electronic stress produced by photoelectrons diffusing into the microstructure [15.188] . The performance of IR imaging via microcantilevers has been enhanced by one-fold leg and two-fold leg beam structures with absorber plates [15.189-191 ].",

            "text": "More than two decades after the first reports on the use of cantilevers as sensors the field is still active with a substantial number of research groups working and publishing. A new trend is the integration of novel materials as sensing layers or the direct use of them as nanomechanical structures. Mass sensing in ultrahigh vacuum down to the yoctogram (10 24 g) range by employing a frequency-modulation mixing technique for the readout of a carbon nanotube resonator has recently been demonstrated by Chaste et al. [15.192] . Electrochemistry is reported to be a way to control the surface of a microcantilever biosensor [15.193] , as the topography of the functionalized cantilever surface seems to influence the efficiency of detection [15.194] . In biochemical measurements the work by Mukhopadhyay et al. [15.195] represents major progress in reliable recognition of DNA by using modified versions of DNA like PNA (peptide nucleic acid) and LNA (locked nuclei acid) having different sugar backbones. Especially for detection of single base mismatches PNA and LNA produce more reliable results [15.196] . The effects of hydration might play an important role in DNA hybridization [15.197] . Ndieyira et al. [15.198] report on nanomechanical detection of antibiotic resistance in bacteria by observing antibiotic-mucopeptide binding, even in blood serum [15.199] . Significant progress in high-throughput screening with cantilever sensors combined with a DVD-ROM-based optical readout technique has been reported by the Boisen group [15.200] . Detection of femtomolar concentrations of oligonucleotides in a complex background of total cellular RNA extracts from cell lines without labeling or amplification has been achieved by Mishra et al. [15.201] giving the perspective of RNA pharmacokinetics, nucleic acid biomarker assays, and miRNA quantification for disease monitoring and diagnosis. Huber et al. [15.202, 203 ] demonstrated application of cantilever sensor arrays for detection of melanoma, based on the presence of a predominant mutation in the BRAF gene. Detection of this single-point mutation allows one to screen melanoma patients for eligibility for treatment with a specific drug which only works if this point mutation is present. Detection and monitoring of Aspergillus niger growth directly on an oscillating cantilever using the first two flexural resonance modes has been observed in [15.204] . Even single spore growth has been observed within 10 h and is reported in [15.205] . A very ingenious way to detect motility of bacteria has been described by Longo et al. [15.206] . They show that fluctuations (noise) in the dc signal of cantilevers onto which low numbers of bacteria have been attached, characterize their metabolism. The technique quantitatively screens (within minutes) the response of bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics. Living bacteria produced larger cantilever fluctuations than bacteria exposed to antibiotics [15.207] . A major contribution to the problem of chemical sensitivity of cantilever sensors has been published by the Thundat group. By using photothermal spectroscopy molecules adsorbing on a bimetallic cantilever can be qualitatively identified [15.208] . The technique is even capable of distinguishing both anti and gauche conformers of EtOH based on wavelength-dependent cantilever deflections [15.209] . Deeper theoretical understanding of viscoelastic phenomena in vibrating nanostructures is described in [15.210 ].",

From a scientific point of view, the challenge lies in optimizing cantilever sensors to improve their sensitivity to the ultimate limit: the detection of individual molecules.",

            "text": "Several fundamentally new concepts in microcantilever sensing are described in the recent literature, and these could help to achieve these goals: the issue of low quality factor of resonating microcantilevers in liquid has been elegantly solved by fabrication of a hollow cantilever that can be filled with biochemical liquids. Confining the fluid to the inside of a hollow cantilever also allows direct integration with conventional microfluidic systems, and significantly increases sensitivity by eliminating high damping and viscous drag [15.211] . Biochemical selectivity can be enhanced by using enantioselective receptors [15.212] . Other shapes for micromechanical sensors like microspirals could be advantageous for biochemical detection [15.213] . Miniaturization of microcantilevers down to true nanometric dimensions, for example by using single-wall carbon nanotubes [15.214] or graphene sheets [15.215] will further increase sensitivity. Reports on optomechanical coupling to graphene-based oscillators via microwaves are already available [15.216] . Single-layer graphene films have also been applied as pressure sensors [15.217] .",

Complicated alignment and calibration procedures should be avoided and preparatory steps before measurement should be automatized. Functionalization and measurement protocols must be standardized, so that every user gets the same results when doing the same experiment. Array-to-array variability must be reduced and evaluation of results must be done in a transparent and reproducible way. We should still keep in mind that we are measuring with cantilever sensors an indirect mechanically transduced response and not a primary physical quantity. Nevertheless, nanomechanical cantilever array sensors offer possibilities to monitor molecular processes that are inaccessible or barely measurable using traditional techniques.",
