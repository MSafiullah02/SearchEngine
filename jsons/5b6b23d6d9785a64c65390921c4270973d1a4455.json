They have also been 67 detected from virtually all types of water: wastewater, seawater, fresh waters, groundwater and 68 drinking water and have been associated with drinking and recreational water outbreaks 69 4 (Bonadonna and La Rosa, 2019; Gall et al., 2015; La Rosa et al., 2012; Moreira and Bondelind; 70 Rusinol, and Girones, 2017). 71 Conversely, enveloped viruses, are structurally dissimilar to the enteric (non-enveloped) viruses, 72 and are believed to behave differently in water environments (Wigginton et al, 2015). This group of 73 viruses includes families such as Orthomyxoviridae (es. Influenza viruses), Paramyxoviridae 74 (measles virus, mumps virus, respiratory syncytial virus, etc.), Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae and 75 several others viruses. Among the enveloped viruses, coronaviruses (CoV) (order Nidovirales, 76 family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae) are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. 77 Coronavirinae, includes four genera, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-and Delta-coronavirus, of which the 78 first two host viruses infecting humans (Human Coronavirus, HCoV): HCoV-229E and HCoV-79 NL63 (alphacoronaviruses) and HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome 80 coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 81 (betacoronaviruses) (Cui et al., 2019). Moreover, several coronavirus are reported to infect wildlife, 82 pets or livestock, such as in the case of bat coronaviruses (BatCoV), porcine enteric diarrhoea CoV 83 (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), 84 bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and others (reviewed in Wong, 2019; Wang, 2019; Tekes, 2016; Amer, 85 2018). 86 HCoV are respiratory pathogens and their primary transmission mode is person-to-person contact 87 through respiratory droplets generated by breathing, sneezing, coughing, etc., and contact (direct 88 contact with an infected subject or indirect contact, trough hand-mediated transfer of the virus from 89 contaminated fomites to the mouth, nose, or eyes).

However, 331 in this study, only small volumes of wastewater were tested using centrifugal ultrafilters. Since 332 viruses in water matrices may occur in very low numbers, there is a need for analytical methods 333 suitable to process large volumes of water. It was therefore concluded by the authors that further 334 progress could be made through the optimization of hollow fiber ultrafilters and tangential flow 335 ultrafiltration to allow concentration of CoV in waters from larger volumes of water. 336 Abd-Elmaksoud and coworkers (2014) measured the effectiveness of glass wool filtration to 337 simultaneously concentrate a variety of waterborne viral and bacterial pathogens typically found in 338 runoff from agricultural fields using dairy manure as fertilizer.

Transmission of COVID-19 116 through the fecal-oral route, however, has not been demonstrated, nor occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 117 in water environments has been proved to date. Information on the presence, quantitative levels, and 118 survival in water environments of coronaviruses of interest for human health are, indeed, limited, and few studies approached development and optimization of methods to concentrate CoV or other 120 enveloped viruses from wastewater, biosolids, surface waters or other water types (see Table 3 ).",

On the other hand, at a lower temperature (4\u00b0C) they persist for 17 179 days. The same study showed that chlorine was more effective than chlorine dioxide in inactivating for drinking-water quality, viruses are generally more resistant to free chlorine than bacteria 187 (specifically, \"moderate\" resistance for viruses, and \"low\" for the vast majority of bacteria) (WHO, 188 2017). The viruses considered of concern for water in WHO Guidelines, however, are principally 189 enteric viruses (familes Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Hepeviridae, Picornaviridae, and 190 Reoviridae) which are, as previously reported, non-enveloped viruses. It is well known that these 191 viruses are more resistant to environmental conditions, water treatments and disinfectants than 192 enveloped viruses like coronavirus, as lysis of the viral envelope leads to the loss of functional 193 receptors required for infection of susceptible cells (Wigginton et al., 2015) . According to the 194 results of Wang (2005a) , SARS-CoV resistance to chlorine is lower than for bacteria. It follows that 195 the current water disinfection practices (drinking water, wastewater, water from swimming pool), effective against non-enveloped viruses and bacteria, are expected to be effective also towards 197 enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses.",

Significantly, the PV-1 lasted 2 to 3 times longer than CoV did, 221 requiring 10.9 days for a comparable reduction in primary wastewater and 5.7 days in secondary effluents.

Since CoV is sensitive to acid (pH 3) and alkaline pH (pH \u2265 10), adsorption 301 was optimal at pH 3.3 and elution at pH 9. Under such conditions, the overall efficiency of the 302 concentration method appeared to be between 24% and 28%. Unfortunately, since it was not 303 possible to retrieve the full text of this publication, no further information, beside those included in 304 the abstract, could be reported. significantly higher (from 33.6% to more than 100%). This method therefore seemed more suitable 315 for the concentration of enveloped viruses, in agreement with the initial study proposing its use, that 316 showed recoveries of enterovirus and hepatitis A virus from tap water ranging from 88.7% to 96.0% 317 (Li et al., 1998) . 318 Ye and colleagues (2016) evaluated three methods for separating and concentrating viruses from the 319 liquid fraction of municipal wastewater: i) PEG precipitation, ii) ultracentrifugation, iii) 320 ultrafiltration with centrifugal devices (Ye et al. 2016) . Wastewater (250 ml for PEG precipitation 321 and ultrafiltration and 60 ml for ultracentrifugation) was spiked with the rodent coronavirus Murine 322 Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and with the non-enveloped phage MS2. Low mean recoveries (~5%) were 323 achieved for both MHV and MS2 with the ultracentrifugation method. This result was suggested to 324 be related to virus inactivation by the high g-force of the ultracentrifugation. Recovery of MHV was low (~5%) also with the PEG precipitation method, whose performance for MS2 concentration was interpretation of these comparative results since the quantity of pathogens used for spiking varied for the different microorganisms, precluding a clear differentiation of the effects on recovery 353 efficiency of seeding quantities and pathogen type. HAV, respectively. Similarly, increasing PEG concentration from 10 to 20% in the secondary 372 concentration, showed a significant improvement of the recovery (51.3% and 47.2% for TGEV and 373 HAV, respectively). Following optimization of the method, the procedure provided a recovery 374 efficiency of 5.1 % for TGEV and 4.5% for HAV in spiked surface water. Overall, the study by non-enveloped viruses need adaptation to yield satisfactory performances on enveloped viruses like 377 CoV.",

Two temperatures were evaluated over 201 6 weeks: room temperature (23-25\u00b0C), and 4\u00b0C. In general, in all the water tested, the titer of 202 infectious virus declined more rapidly at 25\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C, confirming that temperature is an 203 important factor affecting viral survival in water. At 25\u00b0C, the time required for a 99.9% reduction 204 (T 99.9 ) in reagent-grade water was 33 days and 26 days for TGEV and MHV, respectively, while in 205 pasteurized settled sewage it was 14 days and 10 days, respectively. On the other hand, no 206 significant decrease of TGEV and MHV was reported in reagent-grade water at 4 \u00b0C after 49 days, 207 and limited reduction was obtained at the same temperature in lake water after 14 days. Based on 208 these results, the authors suggest that contaminated water may be a potential vehicle for human 209 exposure if aerosols are generated. However, it is important to underline that the surrogate animal 210 coronaviruses used in this study are responsible for gastrointestinal or hepatic diseases in animals 211 and may therefore display a different resistance behaviour compared to respiratory human 212 coronaviruses. This could explain the greater resistance and longer survival displayed by CoV in 213 this work compared to the study of Wang and colleagues (2005a). Moreover, the use of different 214 cell lines and growth media in these persistence studies might have contribute to measurement 215 uncertainty. 216 Gundy et al., 2009 investigated the survival of a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and of an animal 217 coronavirus (FIPV, feline infectious peritonitis virus) in tap water (filtered and non-filtered) and 218 wastewater (primary and activated sludge effluents), comparing results with those of Poliovirus-1 219",

Unpasteurized and pasteurized 234 wastewater were spiked with the viral stocks and were then incubated at 25\u00b0C or 10\u00b0C to mimic 235 typical summer and winter wastewater temperatures. Inactivation proceeded faster for the 236 enveloped viruses: in unpasteurized wastewaters at 25\u00b0C, the time to reach a 90% reduction (T 90 ) 237 was 13 h for MHV and 7 h phage \u03d56, compared to a predicted value of 121 h for the non-enveloped 238 phage MS2. At 10\u00b0C the inactivation kinetics of both MHV and \u03d56 were, once again, significantly 239 slower than at environmental temperatures, with a T 90 of 28-36 h. In pasteurized wastewater, both 240 MHV and phage \u03d56 lost infectivity at a significantly slower rate compared to unpasteurized 241 wastewater (T 90 of 19 h for MHV and 53 h for phage \u03d56 at 25\u00b0C), possibly due to the reduction of 242 bacterial extracellular enzyme activity and the absence of protozoan and metazoan predation in 243 pasteurized samples. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the presence of an indigenous microbial 244population has a negative impact on virus survival(Pinon and Vialette, 2018; Rzezutka and, Cook,   245    2004).

While viral genome was repeatedly detected in 256 hospital sewage before disinfection (10/10 wastewater samples) and, in some cases, after 257 disinfection (3/10 samples), infectious SARS-CoV was never detected in the tested samples.258 Possible explanation of authors includes viral inactivation by disinfectants (high concentration of 259 disinfectants, were used after a patient had bowel movements), low viral concentration, or loss of 260 infectivity by unknown factors during the concentration process. 261 In the second study specifically addressing CoV detection in water, Blanco et al.

The viruses used 356 for the experimental procedures were Hepatitis A virus (HAV, non-enveloped) and the porcine 357 coronavirus Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV). Large volumes of water (5 L and 50 L) 358 were used for method optimization and performance characterization. Several steps of the elution 359 procedure were modified compared to other published glass wool protocols to improve the recovery 360 of TGEV and virus recoveries were ascertained by real-time qPCR. Recovery of the initial 361 experiments (5 L of water, adsorption to the positively charged glass wool matrix, elution with 362 glycine/beef extract buffer at pH 9.5 with 10 min of contact) showed that TGEV efficiently 363 adsorbed onto the glass wool (attachment of 57.1%) but it was poorly eluted from it, with an overall 364 recovery of 2.6%. The increase of buffer pH to 11.0 provided an improvement of elution efficiency, 365 and a final recovery of 28.8%; further performance improvements could be obtained by changing 366 the length of the elution incubation. Subsequent experiments for the concentration of HAV and 367 TGEV from 50 L of spiked water samples were therefore all performed using an elution buffer pH 368 11.0. Results showed that addition of Tween 80 hampered the recovery of TGEV, possibly by 369 damaging the lipid-containing envelope of viruses. Recirculation of the eluent at pH 11.0 for 20 min 370 was instead beneficial to the elution, and provided recoveries of 18.0% and 23.9% for TGEV and 371",
