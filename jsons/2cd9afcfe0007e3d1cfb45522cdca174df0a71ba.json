The considered model parameters are the basic reproduction number R 0 to simulate the effects of social distancing, the time delay \u03b4T Q elapsed between the detection of a symptomatic person and her/his placement in quarantine to suppress her/his contagiousness, and the number Na of asymptomatic people tested positively and isolated. We show that acceptable solutions are obtained for a wide range of parameter values. Thanks to a good control of the initial epidemic spread resulting from an early containment and efficient communication by the sanitary and administrative authorities, the present situation corresponds to a pre-epidemic state. The most safe solutions are a combinations of social distancing, numerous testing to perform a systematic isolation of symptomatic patients and guided detection of asymptomatic people in the entourage of localised symptomatic patients.",

This has led States to take drastic measures of containment to reduce and hopefully stop the propagation of SARS-CoV2 across the population (3, 4) . However, containment may not last beyond two or three months without causing collateral devastating psychological (4) (5) (6) , social and economical effects (7) . For instance, after a full month of containment, a growing part of the French population is already asking for a partial release of the containment conditions and is concerned with the postcontainment procedures (8) . Several countries seem to have passed the maximum of the epidemic crisis and are now preparing their post-containment epoch. Such is the case for France where the daily number of new infected persons seems to begin to decrease slowly (9) . On April 13, the President of the French Republic, Mr Macron, indicated that the end of strict containment period could hopefully start on May 11, 2020. However, it is widely accepted that any uncontrolled ending of containment would undoubtedly result in an exponential restart of the COVID-19 infection (10) . The main reason is that the number of noninfected represents a large fraction of the population, giving to the virus a way to again propagate from only few infectious people. It is of a primary importance to explore and document the positive and negative effects of the different measures that could be envisioned to, at least partly, release the containment for a larger as possible part of the population.",

In the case of COVID-19, keeping R 0 at or slightly above 1 would reduce the instantaneous number of infected people and, subsequently, the instantaneous number of severely affected patients needing intensive cares. This procedure maintains the load of intensive care units below their saturation and guaranties that every patient will benefit of adequate cares. Ultimately, the whole population will have been contaminated and protected against a novel infection. However, because of the infection fatality rate of COVID-19, about 1 \u2212 2% of the population will decease (11, 12) . In France, this would represent the death of approximately 1 million persons. It is preferable to reduce R 0 below 1 in order to stop the spread as quickly as possible and make the absolute number of infected persons as small as possible (3) .",

Presently, this model continues to accurately predict the new data daily released by the sanitary authorities. In the present paper, we evaluate the efficiency of testing and isolating people affected by COVID-19. We also consider the global effects of social distancing through a control of the basic reproduction number R 0 (3). By using a slightly modified version of the model of Allali et al. we give estimates of the efficiency of the testing-isolating-distancing combination of measures to produce a progressive shutdown of the COVID-19 spread in Guadeloupe. 1 . Flowchart of the possible evolution schemes for the \"asymptomatic\" and \"symptomatic\" classes of the model. At time T1, 4 susceptible persons are infected. At the beginning, all four patients are asymptomatic (orange areas) and contagious (hatched areas). When becoming symptomatic (red areas), patient S4 is identified, tested and isolated. The \u03b4T Q parameter represents the time-delay elapsed between the apparitions of the symptoms and the moment when the patient is placed in quarantine to suppress her/his contagiousness. This marks the end of her/his contagiousness period. Asymptomatic patients (e.g. A3 and A2 located in the entourage of S4 are tested and isolated. Patient A1 remains asymptomatic and undetected all along her/his illness period.

Because of their relative high values, both R p and R s are the main quantities to reduce in a spread slow-down protocol. To reach this objective, procedures aimed at stopping the contagiousness of a fraction of infected patients are considered. Owing to the fact that testing everybody everyday is impossible, even for the 400,000 inhabitants of Guadeloupe, we consider that the new symptomatic patients are good entry points. In the present study, we assume that any new symptomatic person is identified, tested and placed in quarantine in a time delay \u03b4T Q after the appearance of the symptoms.

The contagiousness function \u03be c corresponding to the \"presymptomatic\" class is also assigned to our \"asymptomatic\" class. This makes the model more pessimistic in order to make the conclusions more constraining than needed in reality. In the present study, we set \u03be c as a gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters respectively equal to 5 and 1.

The time delay \u03b4T Q represents the duration between the onset of symptoms in a patient and the moment when this patient is identified, tested and isolated. The number N a is the average number of asymptomatic people that are supposed to be identified in the entourage of a detected symptomatic patient. We assume that these asymptomatic patients are isolated simultaneously with the symptomatic person. We shall assume that all other parameters are kept unchanged for all simulations. The values of these parameters are either taken from literature (17) or determined from the fit with the data (Figure 3) . The parameter values are given in Table 1 . We performed numerous simulations for triplets Figure 4 which corresponds to an uncontrolled situation where the exponential growth (Fig. 4A ,F) of infected people continues until the entire population is affected (Fig.  4E) . These solutions inevitably conduct to a very large number of critical (\u03a3N c \u2248 10500) and deceased patients (\u03a3N d \u2248 2800, Fig. 4D ). Because of the large instantaneous number N c of critical patients, intensive care units are overloaded and many patients may not receive adequate cares.

The short exponential growing observed at the beginning of the spread occurs during the delay when no symptomatic patients are declared and isolated. In the model, this delay corresponds to the mean of the log-normal distribution (see Table 1 ). For this kind of solutions, the number of critical and deceased patients remains small (Fig. 5D ) when compared with diverging solutions. The number of persons to isolated every day (black curve in Fig. 5B ) may reach \u2248 200, and adequate logistical and testing facilities are necessary to treat this quantity of people. In case of failure of these facilities, the situation could rapidly become uncontrolled and diverging. The 50% envelopes of the model outputs obtained for the 40 runs (i.e. coloured areas) are narrow, indicating a stability of the stochastic process. Figure 6 . These solutions correspond to situations where the effective reproduction number \u2248 1. In this case, neither the exponential divergence not the damping are observed at long term. Instead, after a short period of exponential growth, the number of asymptomatic and symptomatic people oscillates around a constant level during a long duration (Fig. 6A) . Similar oscillations are observed in the other curves. The instantaneous number of critical patients, N c is maintained at relative high levels (N c \u2248 50 \u2212 100, Fig. 6D ), and the cumulative number of deceased persons, \u03a3N d augments linearly. Contrarily to what is observed for the controlled slow-down solutions of Figure 5 , the 50% envelopes of the critical solutions are very wide. This indicates that the stochastic process is very unstable due to the presence of a bifurcation between diverging and damped solutions (18, 19) . The long-period oscillations visible in several curves (6A-D) may not be attributed to seasonal effects as described by Aron and Schwartz but could be due to stochastic resonance (20) .",

Figure 7 shows the sub-domains obtained for 4 values of R 0 = 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0. All simulations have been performed with an initial number of contagious persons Z I = 100. This number, although realistic, is probably too large, and the results shown in the Figures must be proportionally divided or multiplied to consider a different value for Z I . The sub-domain for R 0 = 4 corresponds to a situation where no social distancing is applied. This R 0 value is slightly smaller than the value found before the beginning of the containment, i.e. when no social distancing policies were given, in the model shown in Figure 3 . As can be observed in the corresponding graph of Figure 7 , no slowing down of the epidemic spread can be obtained without both detecting symptomatic and asymptomatic people. In the most favourable case when \u03b4T Q = 1 day, at least 2.5 and even better 3 asymp-tomatic people must be detected each time a symptomatic patient is identified. Increasing \u03b4T Q worsens the situation with the necessity to detect a larger number of asymptomatic persons. When social distancing is applied, we may expect a decrease of R 0 . In such a case, the smaller the R 0 the wider the slowing down solution domain (Fig. 7) . We observe that even a reduction of R 0 from 4 to 3, an objective that seems very likely to reach, the slowing down can be obtained with seemingly reasonable conditions: \u03b4T Q = 2 days and N a > 2. The solution domains for R 0 = 2 and R 0 = 1.5 offer solutions where it may be unnecessary to systematically detect symptomatic people to obtain a damping of the epidemic spread. However, it must be emphasised that these solutions do not converge quickly and they should only be considered as limit cases.",

The simulations performed for different combinations of the three key parameters, R 0 , \u03b4T Q and N a , allowed to identify 3 main types of solutions: diverging exponential, slowdown damped and critical. These classes of solutions define two domains in the parameter space where conditions conduct either to an exponential spread of the disease or, instead, to a rapid damping of the exponential growth and a cease of the epidemic spread (Fig. 7) . Critical solutions, where no exponential divergence occurs but where a sustained production of infected people remains, are located on a narrow boundary separating the two domains (red solid lines in Fig. 7) . Our simulations show that relatively wide domains of slowdown solutions exist provided the basic reproduction number R 0 \u2264 2 (Fig. 7) . These solutions are clearly those that should be engaged to control the epidemic spread. Owing to the fact that in normal conditions without any social distancing measures R 0 \u2248 4.5 in Guadeloupe (1), it can be concluded that the condition R 0 \u2264 2 can only be obtained by applying some social distancing measures with no strict containment excepted for all symptomatic patients and a subset of asymptomatic people.",

This success certainly results from the conjunction of several positive factors, in particular: i) the fact that the epidemic spread started a few days before the beginning of the containment produced a rapid decrease of R 0 ; ii) the island nature of Guadeloupe enabled a tight control of possibly infected incoming passengers; iii) an efficient and coordinated actions from all sanitary and administrative authorities resulting in clear and coherent messages sent to the population. This good control of the epi-demic spread was already visible in the study by Allali et al. where all model solutions indicated a rapid decrease of R 0 . The management of the post-containment period strongly depends on the number Z I of infected people present in the territory at the beginning of the period. This number depends on the fraction of asymptomatic people who may concur to the propagation of the virus. It is commonly assumed that asymptomatic people represent about 20%, as used in our model. However, values up to 40% seem possible (11, 12) . In the case of Guadeloupe, considering that 12 patients are deceased from COVID-19 by May 1, 2020, and taking an IFR = 0.7% (11), we find a total of 1700 infected persons, representing less than 0.4% of the population of Guadeloupe. Using these figures, at the beginning of the post-containment period scheduled on May 11, 2020, we may expect that the situation in Guadeloupe will correspond to a pre-epidemic situation, where only some tens of infected persons will be present on the territory among a non-immune population. In this case, one may envision that sanitary procedures successfully applied by several countries to contain and quickly stop the epidemic spread at its very beginning are likely to be successful in Guadeloupe. In the case of Singapore (22), spread control was mainly due to early detection of cases through testing and contact tracing around known cases in a way similar to our modelling assumptions described above. The case of Singapore shows that such procedures can be applied without creating a major disruption to daily living. Returning to the case of Guadeloupe, we must consider that certainly not all symptomatic patients will be detected in the \u03b4T Q delay and that social distancing will not be applied in several isolated groups of people. Consequently, a safety margin must be kept in mind when looking for solutions, and our simulations show that R 0 = 2, \u03b4T Q = 2 days and N a = 3 (Fig. 5 ) ensure an efficient slowing down with a very small number of critical and deceased people. This simulation also shows that, at the maximum of the crisis, about 80 symptomatic and asymptomatic people will have to be detected and isolated every day (\"New isolated\" curve in Fig. 5B ).",

This objective corresponds to a slowdown solution in all four domains of Figure 7 with a preference for the cases of Fig. 7C ,D to ensure a sufficiently large distance with the critical boundary. This clearly supposes the involvement of a numerous team of sanitary people to accomplish this task. In addition, the detection of clusters of contaminated people belonging to groups that do not apply social distancing rules should deserve a particular attention (12, 23) .",

The \u03b4T Q parameter represents the time-delay elapsed between the apparitions of the symptoms and the moment when the patient is placed in quarantine to suppress her/his contagiousness. This marks the end of her/his contagiousness period. Asymptomatic patients (e.g. A3 and A2 located in the entourage of S4 are tested and isolated. Patient A1 remains asymptomatic and undetected all along her/his illness period. In the model, patients S3 and S4 may evolve to other states: \"severe\",",

In France, a majority of the persons tested for COVID-19 are patients with severe symptoms and admitted in specialised COVID-19 units. Such is the case in Guadeloupe and, consequently, the cumulative number of persons with COVID-19 as announced by ARS correspond to the \u03a3N s of the model.
