One proposed mechanism involves activation of the innate immune response following influenza infection, leading to a temporary reduction in the risk of infection with a different respiratory virus. By reducing the risk of influenza infection, the influenza vaccine could paradoxically create an increased risk of infection with other noninfluenza respiratory viruses. If this phenomenon occurs, it could lead to biased estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness in studies using laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and influenza-negative controls. In this scenario, the risk of noninfluenza viral illness would be higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals, and an 'influenza-negative' control group would therefore have a higher proportion of vaccinated individuals compared to the source population. This could theoretically contribute to overestimation of true VE (ie, bias away from the null); therefore, a key assumption of the test-negative control design of influenza vaccine effectiveness studies is that the proportion of noninfluenza viral illness does not differ by influenza vaccination status [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 173, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 174, "end": 176, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1299, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The goals of this study were to determine if influenza vaccination is associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses and to determine if vaccine effectiveness estimates differ when different control groups are used in the analysis.

Cross-reactivity of the T-cell response has been described before for different subtypes of influenza A [16] [17] [18] , although cross-reactivity generated by the innate immune system likely lasts only 10-14 days [19] and may not apply to interactions between viruses of different families or species.
