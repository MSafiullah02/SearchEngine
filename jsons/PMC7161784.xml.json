Among these different models, the \u2018fluid mosaic\u2019 model proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972) helps to provide answers about the different roles of the plasma membrane in cell biology, including transport processes, cell protection, cell\u2014cell contact and, principally, cell signalling. The plasma membrane harbours many molecules involved in different cell signalling cascades, such as glycero\u2010 and sphingo\u2010lipids, proteins (receptord, kinases, etc.), which interacts upon different stimuli triggering different cell responses.",

It was shown that lipids are not randomly distributed, leading to the proposal of a new model for understanding the biological membrane architecture (Pike, 2003; Garc\u00eda\u2010Marcos et al., 2006). The new model suggests that the plasma membrane is patchy, with segregated portions that are distinct in structure and function and that can also vary in thickness and composition. From the first reports in the 1950s provided by Palade (1953) and Yamada (1955) showing stable flask\u2010like invaginations of the plasma membrane, to the current view of multiple membrane domains allowing different protein\u2014lipid and protein\u2014protein interactions that compartmentalize and temporarily order the membrane moiety, many different reports still bring some controversy to the theme.",

It is now widely accepted that lipid rafts are not pre\u2010existing domains in which proteins dynamically partition, but rather that the formation and disassembly of raft domains is a dynamic process (see, for example, Plowman et al., 2005). Later, rafts were visually observed by Simons and Ikonen (1997), who described them as lipid rafts, imagining these microdomains as floating islands in the membrane (Triantafilou et al., 2002; Luo et al., 2008). Further studies provided evidence that lipid rafts are mainly composed of cholesterol, (glyco)sphingolipids and (glycero)phospholipids, with a high degree of saturation in their fatty\u2010acid chains (Figure 1a). The tight interaction between these components provides the basis of their packing and rigidity, which leads to a phase separation (Simons and Ikonen, 1997).",

The development of this method is widely used for the isolation and analysis of lipid rafts and their associated proteins in different cell types (Triantafilou et al., 2002; Bouillon et al., 2003; Chazal and Gerlier, 2003; Laughlin et al., 2004; Tortelote et al., 2004; Vacca et al., 2004; Olsson and Sundler, 2006). However, new considerations about the term \u2018detergent\u2010resistant membranes\u2019 (DRMs) had already been reviewed. DRM no longer defines the bona fide rafts (Lai, 2003), because this technique can create several artifacts, such as the loss of membrane components during extraction (Edidin, 2003). However, many proteins functionally involved with microdomains had already been described via this method, as discussed by Lai (2003). Another efficient tool used to study lipid rafts is cholesterol depletion, by the use of cholesterol\u2010removing and \u2010binding agents, such as cyclodextrins and filipin (Schnitzer et al., 1994; Luker et al., 2000). This method is based on the theory that cholesterol acts as a dynamic \u2018glue\u2019, holding lipid rafts together, and its removal from the membrane results in the dispersion of raft\u2010associated lipids and proteins (Ma\u00f1es et al., 2003; Hawkes and Mak, 2006). Considering that cholesterol is a relatively rigid molecule, it was postulated that cholesterol\u2010rich microdomains have a slower mobility in the membrane than non\u2010raft regions (Shaw, 2006).",

            "text": "Nowadays, more accurate methods are employed in order to improve the research into lipid rafts. Fluorescent biosensors that are capable of tracking signalling events in live cells are powerful tools to aid the understanding of dynamic cellular signalling (Gao and Zhang, 2008). The proposals regarding microdomains postulated in the late 1990s can be now supported by, for example, FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) microscopy and AFM (atomic force microscopy). Given the importance of the Akt pathway in cell proliferation and survival, and thus its involvement in cancer, this pathway has been increasingly studied. Gao and Zhang (2008) developed a genetically encodable Akt activity reporter and analysed the spatiotemporal dynamics of Akt activity within plasma membrane microdomains by FRET. Using this tool, it was observed that Akt activity is differentially regulated between raft and non\u2010raft regions of the plasma membrane (Gao and Zhang, 2008). In addition, AFM has been described as an essential tool to follow the motion of lipid\u2010raft microdomains and proteins that might be interacting with them (Henderson et al., 2004). Several works have demonstrated the importance of AFM in experimental approaches to study lipid rafts. Poole et al. (2004), studying MDCK (Madin\u2014Darby canine kidney) cell microvilli, suggested that lipid rafts might be involved in the maintenance of these structures. These authors used a combination of AFM and laser\u2010scanning confocal microscopy in order to attest their hypothesis. Cecchi et al. (2009) interestingly observed an increase in specific amyloid ligands when raft components, such as cholesterol, are depleted. This group suggested that cholesterol can reduce membrane modifications triggered by amyloid residues at the lipid\u2010raft level, possibly involving physicochemical features. The techniques of AFM and confocal microscopy in combination with inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis and an agent that chelates cholesterol were allied in the study of lipid rafts in this context, as well as the pursuit of flotillin\u20101 and the ganglioside GM1, which are known markers of microdomains.",

The size, arrangement and movement of lipid rafts are dynamic and can be found in localized cellular structures, such as filipodia and cell adhesion points (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003; Hawkes and Mak, 2006). It is accepted that membrane rafts in basal conditions are small regions of the lipid membranes, which tend to cluster after certain stimuli to form larger structures that are also called platforms (Liu and Anderson, 1995; Holopainen et al., 1998; Kusumi et al., 2004; Bollinger et al., 2005; Rao and Mayor, 2005). It is important to mention that the assembly of those small regions (pre\u2010rafts) seems to be dependent on the presence of ceramide (Liu and Anderson, 1995; Bollinger et al., 2005). In addition to the lipid components, a variety of cell receptors and signalling proteins are known to be associated with membrane rafts. They include the GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)\u2010anchored proteins, kinases and adaptor molecules that act as intermediate transducers for many receptors, including TCRs (T\u2010cell receptors) and BCRs (B\u2010cell receptors) (Montixi et al., 1998; Cheng et al., 1999; Chazal and Gerlier, 2003; Hawkes and Mak, 2006).",

Such a localization seems to be critical for T\u2010cell activation. The binding of TCRs to MHC class II molecules of APCs (antigen\u2010presenting cells) occurs in lipid rafts. The raft aggregation promotes tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of signalling proteins, but excludes certain proteins, such as the tyrosine phosphatases CD45 and CD43, which leads to the formation of a supramolecular activation cluster (Monks et al., 1998). However, in vivo, TCR does not constitutively reside in membrane lipid rafts. After T\u2010cell activation, the TCR moves into the rafts (Monks et al., 1998; Anderson et al., 2000; Luo et al., 2008). This characteristic was also observed for other molecules that migrate to the lipid rafts after specific stimulation in several physiological events.",

            "text": "There is a specific subtype of microdomain called caveolae. These structures are small membrane\u2010surface invaginations, which were initially described as cave\u2010like invaginations of the plasma membrane, 50\u2013100 nm in size and found in many cell types (Figure 1b). Although they were identified by electron microscopy more than 50 years ago as an invagination in the plasma membrane with a flask\u2010shape morphology that can be singular or found in detached grape\u2010like clusters, caveolin caveolae have remained enigmatic structures (Palade, 1953; Yamada, 1955; Razani et al., 2002; Lajoie et al., 2009). Forty years after the description of caveolae, their structure could be more closely studied upon the discovery of caveolin, the signature protein present in calveolae (Rothberg et al., 1992). It has been suggested that caveolae can be stabilized by caveolin and, additionally, may further become immobilized by filamin, which binds to caveolin, as well as to the actin cytoskeleton (Stahlhut and van Deurs, 2000; Hommelgaard et al., 2005). Since that time, caveolae have been implicated and demonstrated to be important in a variety of cellular functions, including endocytic processes, cholesterol and lipid homoeostasis, signal transduction and tumour suppression (Razani et al., 2002; Duncan et al., 2002; Ma\u00f1es et al., 2003; Cohen et al., 2004; Tortelote et al., 2004). The protein caveolin\u20101 has itself been implicated in signal transduction, because of its direct interaction with a multitude of signalling molecules through the caveolin\u2010scaffolding domain. In addition, caveolin\u20101 has been shown to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues during some signalling events (Mastick and Saltiel, 1997; Okamoto et al., 1998; Ushio\u2010Fukai et al., 2001; Duncan et al., 2002).",

Previous studies proposed that, as well as caveolae, caveolins also have an important involvement in signal transduction, principally due to its scaffold domain, which acts as a harbour for different cytosolic proteins involved in different signalling cascades (Sargiacomo et al., 1993; Lisanti et al., 1994; Razani et al., 2002; Cohen et al., 2004).",

The most thoroughly studied of these is SV40 (simian virus 40). SV40 initiates infection by binding to the MHC class I molecules (Stang et al., 1997; Anderson et al., 1998; Duncan et al., 2002; Chazal and Gerlier, 2003). SV40 directly associates with caveolae, leading to a loss of actin stress fibres and the appearance of actin tails emanating from the virus containing caveolae (Duncan et al., 2002; Pelkmans et al., 2002). Moreover, caveolae transport SV40 particles to the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), where the virus is disassembled (Norkin et al., 2002; Chazal and Gerlier, 2003).",

            "text": "Enveloped viruses also use rafts during the internalization and fusion process. The entry of enveloped virus involves virus attachment, followed by close apposition of the virus and plasma membranes. Then the two membranes fuse to deliver the virus' genomic RNA into the host cells, which requires conversion of the virus\u2010encoded envelope glycoprotein (Env) from its native state to its fusion\u2010activated form (Fantini et al., 2002; Chazal and Gerlier, 2003; Ma\u00f1es et al., 2003). The glycoproteins of several viruses, including influenza virus, HIV, MLV (murine leukaemia virus), measles virus and Ebola virus, are associated with host\u2010cell membrane rafts (Scheiffele et al., 1997; Manie et al., 2000; Vincent et al., 2000; Pickl et al., 2001; Bavari et al., 2002). Additionally, there is biochemical evidence showing that cholesterol and possibly cholesterol\u2010rich lipid rafts are required for efficient porcine pseudorabies virus entry (Desplanques et al., 2008). Another recent study reported that the SARS\u2010CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) receptor is located in lipid rafts and the productive entry of the SARS\u2010CoV pseudovirus into the host cell requires the presence of intact and functional lipid rafts (Lu et al., 2008). Fusion of SFV (Semliki Forest virus) and SIN (Sindbis virus), as well as other alphaviruses, depends on the presence of cholesterol and sphingolipid in the target membrane (Bron et al., 1993; Lu et al., 1999; Smit et al., 1999; Chazal and Gerlier, 2003), which are known to be abundant in lipid rafts (Pike, 2003). Other enveloped viruses enter the host cell using a pH\u2010independent fusion process, as found for HIV. The HIV\u20101 Env is composed of two associated glycoprotein subunits, gp120 and gp41. The external gp120 is responsible for the attachment to the cellular receptors and co\u2010receptors (chemokine receptor family member CCR5 and/or CXCR4), whereas the transmembrane protein gp41 is responsible for the fusion of viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the target CD4+ T\u2010cells (Popik et al., 2002). Rafts are proposed to be the specific cell membrane regions in which these clustering events occur. It is important to point out that the entry of HIV\u20101 through rafts may direct the virus complex into a favourable compartment for a productive infection (Fantini et al., 2002; Chazal and Gerlier, 2003; Ma\u00f1es et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2008). A recent study showed that HIV entry into macrophages is sensitive to membrane cholesterol depletion, which favours the hypothesis for a role of macrophage lipid rafts in the HIV\u20101 entry process (Carter et al., 2009).",

Membrane lipids are not randomly incorporated into the viral envelope.

On the other hand, in polarized epithelial cells, the viral glycoproteins contain sorting signals or motifs and are directed to the specific site where assembly and budding will occur (Nayak et al., 2004). Lipid rafts function as microdomains for concentrating viral glycoproteins and may serve as a platform for virus budding. The structures have the ability to regulate budding; however, the mechanism by which the lipid raft can favour the budding and/or fission process is as yet unknown (Nayak et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2008). The budding of new virions from the raft allows the exclusion or inclusion of specific host\u2010cell membrane proteins in the virus particle, which could disrupt cellular and/or humoral immune responses to the virus (Vanderplasschen et al., 1998; Peterlin and Trono, 2003).",

The manipulation of signalling pathways, which involve the host\u2010cell kinases, can lead to an efficient way to enter, proliferate and exit the host cell during the infectious cycle (M\u00fcnter et al., 2006). Recently, Maza et al. (2008) investigated yeast forms of P. brasiliensis in the context of kinase signalling. It was observed that this pathogen promotes the aggregation of lipid rafts in epithelial cells, which is an important step to fungal adhesion and Src kinase family activation. Thereby, for the first time, it was shown that a pathogenic fungus can interact with host\u2010cell membrane rafts to establish infection. Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a microsporidiam parasite that affects the nervous system, as well as the respiratory and digestive tracts, resides in a parasitophorous vacuole surrounded by host\u2010cell lipids, was labelled with DilC16 (1,1\u2032\u2010dihexadecyl\u20103,3,3\u2032,3\u2032\u2010tetramethylindocarbocyanine), a marker for lipid rafts, and DiO (3,3\u2032\u2010dilinoleyloxacarbocyanine), a marker for non\u2010raft membrane domains, which suggests that both contribute to the formation of the vacuole membrane (R\u00f6nneb\u00e4umer et al., 2008).

Previous studies related that these parasites can interact with lipid rafts during the infection process, because parasitophorous vacuole membranes contain host raft lipids and proteins (Aikawa et al., 1978; Mordue et al., 1999; Lauer et al., 2000). This event shows that parasites might hijack or recruit these microdomains during infection. Furthermore, GPI\u2010anchored proteins, such as CD55 and CD59, that are major inhibitors of membrane complement, are progressively depleted from the infected cell surface (Haldar et al., 2002). It was further demonstrated that host raft cholesterol is important to vacuolar parasites because, when cholesterol was depleted from Plasmodium\u2010infected erythrocytes, the expulsion of non\u2010infective parasites occurred (Lauer et al., 2000). In addition, cholesterol depletion from red blood cells prevents P. falciparum infection (Samuel et al., 2001).

Flotillin\u20102, a raft protein anchored in plasma membrane by acylation, was also discarded from its parasitophorous vacuole (Charron and Sibley, 2004). It was demonstrated during T. gondii infection that selective portioning at the host\u2014parasite interface is a highly complex process and that the raft interaction can benefit the parasite inclusion into parasitophorous vacuoles (Charron and Sibley, 2004). On the other hand, it was observed that the association with membrane microdomains is not necessary to direct insertion of host\u2010cell membrane molecules into T. gondii parasitophorous vacuole (Charron and Sibley, 2004). Murphy et al. (2007) related that different remodelling and sorting may occur in distinct endo\u2010vacuoles. In this case, primaquine was used to disturb red blood cell membranes and induce detergent\u2010free vesicles, which are enriched in cholesterol, raft proteins (flotillin and stomatin) and PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5\u2010bisphosphate).

Cholesterol also appeared to be important in the infection by the trypanosomatide, Leishmania (Pucadyil et al., 2004). This parasite can enter, survive and proliferate inside macrophages (Alexander and Russell, 1992). Leishmania donovani is responsible for the visceral leishmaniasis (Parson et al., 1983), which is characterized by defective cell\u2010mediated immunity (Basak et al., 1992; Saha et al., 1995; Sen et al., 2001). L. donovani LPG (lipophosphoglycan) requires intact membrane rafts to control host\u2010cell functions. It was reported that LPG associates with membrane rafts in the host cell and exerts its actions on host\u2010cell actin and phagosomal maturation through subversion of raft function (Winberg et al., 2009). Macrophages infected with Leishmania are unable to present, even processing\u2010independent peptide sequences, to T\u2010cells, and this event is not due to MHC expression (Prina et al., 1993). In this context, lipid rafts are also involved in the interaction between MHC and APC (Poloso and Roche, 2004). L. donovani can affect antigen presentation of macrophages due to the increase in membrane fluidity, which leads to a lipid\u2010raft disruption. Although the number of MHC complexes in infected cell surfaces was sufficient, there was no possibility of forming an aggregate and stimulating T\u2010cells (Chakraborty et al., 2005).",

This family of receptors, which might be activated by PAMPs (pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns), such as gram\u2010negative bacteria LPS (lipopolysaccharide), is important to pathogen recognition. However, only a few members constitutively co\u2010localize with membrane microdomains (Triantafilou et al., 2002). Besides, other TLRs can migrate to this specific region after activation. In the macrophage\u2010like cell line RAW 264.7, for example, LPS stimulation induces translocation of CD14, ERK\u20102 (extracellular\u2010signal\u2010regulated kinase 2) and p38 to lipid rafts, but other proteins also involved in the LPS signalling response do not migrate within these microdomains (Triantafilou et al., 2007; Olsson and Sundler, 2006). In addition, Cuschieri et al. (2006) observed that when the human monocytic cell line THP\u20101 was stimulated with LPS, there was a mobilization of TLR4 and HSP70 into the lipid raft. Taken together, these examples show the importance of the aggregation of specific receptor molecules within lipid rafts facilitating the LPS signalling to favour the clearance of intracellular pathogens (Triantafilou et al., 2002). Other molecules are able to induce receptor migration into lipid rafts, for example, DAMPs (damage\u2010associated molecular patterns). Extracellular ATP is a nucleotide which works as an important DAMP (Di Virgilio, 2005). P2 purinergic receptors, a family of nucleotide receptors, are involved with inflammatory responses (Burnstock and Knight, 2004; Bours et al., 2006; Burnstock, 2009) and the clearance of intracellular pathogens (Coutinho\u2010Silva et al., 2007, 2009). Several motifs in P2X7 receptors have been identified that are homologous with those known to be involved in protein\u2014protein interactions and LPS binding. It was suggested that the C\u2010terminal region of the P2X7 receptor may directly associate with proteins and/or lipids that are important for regulating macrophage function (Denlinger et al., 2001). In addition, the activation of P2X7 receptors can induce ceramide generation and accumulation in macrophages (Raymond and Le Strunff, 2006), which is a sphingolipid implicated to be involved with the formation of larger rafts, so called signalling platforms (Gulbins et al., 2004).",

Recently, we observed that the disruption of lipid rafts can reduce P2X7\u2010activated pore formation on dendritic cells and macrophages from humans and mice (F.S. Vieira and R. Coutinho\u2010Silva, unpublished data). Thus it is possible to suggest that the integrated signals from P2 receptors and TLRs located on rafts might explain the synergic effects of these sensors on stimulation of the immune response (Hu et al., 1998; Perregaux et al., 2000; Garc\u00eda\u2010Marcos et al., 2009) (Figure 3).",

One of these strategies could be to block HIV\u20101 entry and its replication using natural dietary and plant\u2010derived compounds that target lipid rafts, principally due to its affinity for cholesterol (Verma, 2009). Sakamoto et al. (2005) showed that a secondary fungal metabolite (NA255) acts as a new anti\u2010HCV (hepatitis C virus) replication inhibitor that targets host lipid rafts, suggesting that the inhibition of sphingolipid metabolism may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of HCV infection. In addition, a novel therapeutic strategy, considering the biochemistry of raft\u2014pathogen interaction, called glycolipidomimetics, was proposed by Ta\u00efeb et al. (2004).",

However, several articles still refer to membrane microdomains as a DRM; this denomination should be used carefully, considering that this separation method is not completely reliable in unveiling these structures. There is an ongoing controversy regarding the nature and function of lipid rafts, because different experimental approaches have yielded different results. Meanwhile, these substantial experimental data in the literature have provided not only biochemical but also microscopical evidence for the close relationship between different pathogens and lipid rafts. Another important consideration is the now widely accepted view that lipid rafts may not be pre\u2010existing domains, but dynamic membrane regions that can fuse to each other to form larger rafts or signalling platforms enriched in ceramide (Liu and Anderson, 1995; Holopainen et al., 1998; Bollinger et al., 2005; Plowman et al., 2005). This fusion of small pre\u2010rafts may be induced in different cell types upon infection by different pathogens. Thus the association of a protein with lipid rafts during cell infection may be a unique event concerning this protein and rafts, which may mean that this association never occurs naturally. So upon the parasite adhesion, this protein is directed to the raft. Similarly, cholesterol is known to be involved in many different cellular functions, and not only the assembly and maintenance of lipid rafts, which leads us to propose that other cellular processes, rather than the disruption or disturbance of lipid rafts, may explain how some pathogens enter and survive within their hosts.",

There are at least two major mechanisms involving the host lipid raft by which parasites gain entry to the host cytoplasm and are able to survive: (i) the avoidance of lysosomal fusion and posterior degradation; and (ii) the modulation of host\u2010cell signalling pathways to its own benefits.",
