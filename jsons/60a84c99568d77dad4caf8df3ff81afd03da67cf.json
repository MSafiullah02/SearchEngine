We received excellent comments and congratulations for the excellence and quality of the invited speakers, and many oral and poster presentations. ICAR retains its flavor and personality, providing an interdisciplinary forum at which investigators involved in basic, translational, and clinical research worldwide meet to review recent developments in all areas of antiviral research, drug and vaccine development. As mentioned below, a new format of the ICAR report has been published in Antiviral Research with highlights and reviews of most oral presentations. Additionally, satellite activities such as the Women in Science Roundtable, the Career Development Panel and the New Member and First Time Attendee luncheon (The Happy Hour) provided an opportunity to discuss other issues of relevance. I take the opportunity to thank again the co-chairs of the Program Committee, Justin Julander and Mark Prichard, and all committee chairs and members for their unselfish commitment to organize the 2017 conference.",

Close to 50% of the global human population live in dengue endemic areas and are at risk of contracting the disease. Poorly controlled urban development and vector spreading, which is thought to be associated with global warming, are possible contributors for the expansion of dengue (Gubler, 2006) . It was estimated that around 100 million symptomatic dengue cases occurred in 2010 out of a total of nearly 400 million infections (Bhatt et al., 2013) . Disease manifestations range from asymptomatic to a mild undifferentiated dengue fever (DF) and in up to 5% of symptomatic cases progresses to serious life-threatening complications as a result of vascular leakage, hemorrhage and organ dysfunction (Simmons et al., 2012 , Low et al 2017 . Secondary dengue infections are often, but not consistently associated with severe dengue disease in part because of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon (Halstead, 2007) .",

These crystals are amenable to fragment based screening and structuredirected antiviral development (Zhang et al., 2016) . In the case of NS5, the structures also show high similarity and the nucleoside inhibitor NITD 008 is widely used as a control for drug screening efforts with different compound libraries (Barrows et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016) . Opportunities for non-nucleoside inhibitors also exist since the structural similarities reveal conserved pockets near regions that are critical for de-novo initiation for viral RNA replication that can be targeted. Important lessons have been learned about conducting dengue antiviral clinical trials using repurposed drugs, which has been reviewed recently (Low et al., 2017) . This strategy is being more widely and systematically applied to discover novel individual or combination compounds as potential pan-flaviviral drugs. Given the acute nature of dengue and the narrow window of opportunity for antiviral treatment, it is likely that the number of patients who can be recruited to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs may limit early phase clinical trials. Additionally, the high cost of large trials with long study duration may limit the number of compounds entering Phase II/III trials with detrimental effect on the whole process of drug discovery and development.",

Or perhaps the (immuno)pathology of virus infections may boost some specific enzyme reactions in the infected organs? The availability of genome-wide proteomic and metabolomic profiles can provide clues on which enzymes could be considered. One drawback is that these enzymes may be confined to primary cells or more complex tissues, which are harder to isolate, manipulate or infect with viruses for in vitro studies.",

Hard times came to me in 1996 when my grants ran out and other funding sources were drying up. It was then that I took a job as a contractor at USAMRIID, where I worked for nearly three years.

I was able to obtain funding for poxvirus work at USU, which gave me a jump-start back in academia. Moreover, I still interact with one of my colleagues from the USAMRIID era, Mike Bray, who is the current Editorin-Chief for Antiviral Research. One interesting thing occurred a few years after I left USAMRIID. I was interviewed by the U.S. Postal Service that was working with the FBI to investigate people who may have been involved in the anthrax terror attacks of 2001. I was investigated because, while at USAMRIID, I was a colleague with Steve Hatfill, who was their main terrorist suspect at the time.",

The most significant work I accomplished in my career was in the early 1980's when I participated in the preclinical development of ganciclovir. There were five companies vying for the rights to the compound, and Syntex emerged victorious. It was an exciting time because ganciclovir was a very hot topic and there were many people interested in it. Another significant part of my career has been the development of new animal models of viral infections. This has been diverse, and included developing different types of herpesvirus infections in immunocompromised mice, new orthopoxvirus models, and new models with arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, and orthomyxoviruses. In the latter categories, it has been exciting to work with a broad array of different RNA viruses.",

Animal experimentation is where the rubber meets the road in terms of an antiviral compound's potential to become a drug. I have read too many articles in the scientific literature where in vitro activity was touted, but with no evidence of efficacy in animals reported. Later, most of the compounds fell by the wayside due to lack of in vivo efficacy. The approach we have taken at the Institute for Antiviral Research is to publish the results of cell culture and animal testing data in the same article. Animal work will forever play a key role in drug development. Continuing research into the discovery of new animal models is essential.",

Rupintrivir is highly potent in vitro against picornaviruses, but failed in treating rhinovirus infections in the clinic. Had this new animal model of EV-D68 infection existed in the early stages of rupintrivir development, the company would have been able to find out the ineffectiveness of the compound long before they invested in expensive clinical trials.",

I worked closely with John Martin (currently CEO of Gilead Sciences) when he was a chemist at Syntex. He was a key player in the team that developed ganciclovir. Many of the individuals that I collaborate with or do projects for are members of ISAR. The ICAR meeting brings diverse disciplines together and it is a chance to interact face-to-face with colleagues that I otherwise only visit through email or with occasionally on the telephone.

I have been asked to express some thoughts about my career, the colleagues I have worked with, my membership in ISAR, and how attendance at ICAR has benefited my career. My first job out of college was the most important one to prepare me for my career as a research scientist in virology. I received my Bachelor of Science degree during the Vietnam era along with a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. At that time, the Vietnam War was nearly winding down. I did not serve in Vietnam but was assigned to the 7 th Infantry Division at Ft. Ord, California. I initially was a medical platoon leader, and later worked in the Division Surgeon's Office where I did an extensive amount of technical writing. This prepared me for graduate school at Utah State University (USU), and college expenses were largely funded under the GI Bill. Because of my military training, writing my thesis and dissertation was not a burden, and the time spent preparing these documents was minimal. During my scientific career, I have seen many graduate students struggle mightily with writing because they lacked experience. Because I had enjoyed my time in the military, my immediate goal after graduate school was to get a position at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). However, this did not happen exactly as planned. I spent my first eight years after graduate school in two pharmaceutical companies, Syntex Research and ICN Pharmaceuticals. Syntex was later acquired by Roche and ICN terminated its research program and its name was changed to MP Biomedicals. When ICN was winding down, I left there to work at the Institute for Antiviral Research at Utah State University (USU) under Robert Sidwell who was the Institute's director. This was a soft money position, and the money ebbed and flowed from year to year.",

The first ICAR meeting that I attended was held in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1988. The scientific meeting was excellent, and Colonial Williamsburg was fabulous to visit. The Jerusalem meeting in 1999 was also high on my list of favorites. I went to that meeting with my colleagues John Huggins and Mike Bray from USAMRIID. The ISAR has been a valuable part of my research career.",
