The EU has called this as \"an unprecedented displacement crisis\" and has aimed at devising a comprehensive approach to tackle it, which has been widely criticized. Concerns about public healthcare aspects of the crisis have permanently entered the media and policy discourse even though no systematic association between migration and the importation of infectious diseases has been recorded. In this context, the literature has not filled the existing gap between discourse and evidence, and almost no publications with reliable empirical data exist, both thematic (epidemiology) and geographical (Eastern Europe and Bulgaria). Among the existing publications, the focus has been on TB and HIV (Odone et al., Euro J Public Health 25 (3): [506][507][508][509][510][511][512] 2015). In light of this, the aim of this research is to contribute to the debate by providing an overview of the refugee situation in Bulgaria, as a primary entry-point for refugees entering the EU. In order to achieve this, the article analyses the case of the refugee camp in city of Harmanly, close to the Bulgarian-Turkish border, and assesses the public health risks related to this specific situation. Based on a study of 128 patients with different symptoms we aim to draw wider implications about the linkages between public health and migration. The in-depth review of this specific case shows that both the probability and impact of migration on public health increases when the hosting country is relatively poor, the domestic public healthcare system is not efficient, and there is lack of trust in the government and public services. The study contributes to understanding better these risks in order to identify potential mitigation strategies in the region and the EU as a whole.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The European migrant/refugee crisis in 2015-2016 deeply challenged the political, economic and healthcare systems in the European Union (EU).

Based on regular EASO annual reports, since 2011 one can see the changing structure of migration trends altogether. Until then migration was mainly from lower income countries to countries with a higher income and the greatest percentage of migrants represented the share of those arriving from Western Balkan countries.

Should a rare exotic infectious agent be imported, Europe is well prepared to respond, as shown over the past 10 years in responses to imported cases of Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease and MERS' [28] . At the same time, events in Germany on the weekend of 12-13 September 2015 demonstrated the opposite: large-scale migration provoked serious malfunctioning of both political and administrative systems including police, social services, housing, public healthcare [1] . After these events, reported in depth by Robin Alexander, the responses across Europe quickly escalated. Once the EU-Turkey deal was agreed, Balkan border closures organised by Austria followed by Hungary, Serbia and Macedonia left some 11-13,000 migrants blocked in the informal camp in Idomeni on the Greek-Macedonian border [24] . From the beginning of March to the end of May asylum seekers there survived in poor sanitary conditions with very limited running water, no lavatories, and insufficient food, despite efforts by NGOs such as 'Hot food Idomeni' and medical care from 'M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8re'.

Bulgarian membership of the EU on January 1, 2007 led to an increase in the flow of migrants to Bulgaria and a slow but sustainable decrease of Bulgarian emigrants. This situation has changed radically since the start of the civil war in Syria in 2011.

The mission concluded that the level of assistance provided to the migrants by the Bulgarian Government has clearly improved but the medical response system is very fragile and not fully prepared to respond to a possible new and larger influx of migrants. The main weakness of the response system is the weak provision of primary health care through clinics in migrant centres or the assignment of general practitioners (GP) to migrants due to the fact that clinics are understaffed and interpretation services are not always available. As a consequence, the first recommendation of WHO is the revision of the National plan for crisis management with a focus on reorganizing primary health care services and rationalizing the use of available resources [27, p. 15 ]. To put this into context, in the following section we provide an overview of the institutions and personnel involved in refugee and migrant management. Upon arrival in Bulgaria, the asylum seekers first face the authorities of the Ministry of Interior. By law, migrants can be held for up to 24 hours at a location, where basic health screening is conducted, and from there they are directed to the Registration and Reception Centre (RRC), the Transit Centre (TC) or detention centres where primary care is carried out. Primary healthcare in detention centres is the responsibility of the Medical Institute of the Ministry of Interior, situated in Sofia, while medical staff in RRC and TC should be provided by the State Agency for Refugees ( Fig. 4.10) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 215, "end": 219, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 975, "end": 985, "text": "[27, p. 15", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1732, "end": 1742, "text": "Fig. 4.10)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Health Aspects of Migrant Crisis in Bulgaria"}, {"text": "According to Bulgarian legislation, access to public health services requires payment of health insurance contributions. Asylum seekers and persons applying for refugee status are funded by the State Agency for Refugees. In case they have acquired refugee status or the right to asylum, they are obliged to pay health insurance themselves to access the basic package of health care to which Bulgarian citizens are entitled under the insurance system. However, the vast majority of refugees cannot cover their health insurance. For this reason, in March 2017 the Bulgarian government passed a normative act creating an obligation for municipalities to cover health insurance expenses of migrants with official refugee status already granted. After strong public outcry the government withdrew the proposed act and this issue remains open. Moreover, even when migrants fulfil their financial contribution, the number of refugees with an assigned GP is limited due to language barriers and the reluctance of many GPs to take on patients whose residence is likely to be temporary [27, p. 6] . The other important recommendation of the WHO assessment mission to Bulgaria is the revision of the disease surveillance early warning and response system, introducing syndromic surveillance to increase early detection of outbreaks and effectively monitoring selected disease trends [27, p. 6] . Such a syndromic surveillance system has not been created yet and it is unknown whether the government plans to implement one.
