Proteases can promote infl ammation by regulating expression and activity of different pro-infl ammatory cytokines, chemokines and other immune components in the lung compartment. They are categorized in three major subcategories: serine proteases, metalloproteases and cysteine proteases especially in case of lung diseases. Neutrophil-derived serine proteases (NSPs), metalloproteases and some mast cell-derived proteases are mainly focused here. Their modes of actions are different in different diseases for e.g. NE induces the release of IL-8 from lung epithelial cells through a MyD88/IRAK/TRAF-6dependent pathway and also through EGFR MAPK pathway. NSPs contribute to immune regulation during infl ammation through the cleavage and activation of specifi c cellular receptors. MMPs can also infl uence the progression of various infl ammatory processes and there are many non-matrix substrates for MMPs, such as chemokines, growth factors and receptors. During lung infl ammation interplay between NE and MMP is an important signifi cant phenomenon. They have been evaluated as therapeutic targets in several infl ammatory lung diseases. Here we review the role of proteases in various lung infl ammatory diseases with emphasis on their mode of action and contribution to immune regulation during infl ammation.",

Other cells, including epithelial, endothelial, and fi broblasts, also synthesize proteases [ 13 , 14 ] . Serine proteases, including Neutrophil Elastase (NE), Cathepsin G (CG), and Proteinase 3 (PR 3), are packaged in primary granules within neutrophils [ 15 ] .

However, these and other enzymes within the respiratory tract may also inactivate or disarm various PARs by cleaving them at other sites that remove the tethered ligand sequence [ 17 ] . Proteases have crucial role in chemotaxis of all of the various infl ammatory cell types to the lung. MMP-9 and serine proteases increase eosinophil chemotaxis, and MMP-12 is responsible for eosinophil and macrophage accumulation [ 18 , 19 ] .

After release, these proteases also contribute to the extracellular killing of microorganisms, and regulate non-infectious infl ammatory processes by activating specifi c receptors and modulating the levels of cytokines [ 21 ] . In addition to their involvement in pathogen destruction and the regulation of proinfl ammatory processes, NSPs are also involved in a variety of infl ammatory human conditions, including chronic lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fi brosis, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) [ 22 -25 ] .

            "text": "NE is a serine-protease of the chymotrypsin family stored in primary (azurophilic) granules of PMNs along with proteinase-3 and cathepsin G, two other neutrophil serine-proteases. Intracellular stored NE comes in action when azurophilic granules are incorporated to the phagosome [ 26 ] . However, in vitro stimulation of PMNs with physiological relevant pro-infl ammatory stimuli induces either transfer of NE to the plasma membrane (membrane-bound NE associated to by proteoglycans) [ 27 , 28 ] , or a secretion in the extracellular space specially in case of pulmonary chronic (CF and COPD) [ 29 , 30 ] Fig. 1 Mechanism of neutrophil elastase (NE) induced-release of IL-8 from lung epithelial cells. Following its release from the azurophilic granules in response to pathogenic/pathologic insult, NE activates TNFa converting enzyme (TACE), which in turn cleaves proTGFa (pro-transforming growth factor a) to generate soluble TGFa as a ligand for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR co-localizes with toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and a signal transduction cascade is initiated via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88 or Mal), IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and the IkB kinases (IKKs), leading to a degradation of inhibitor of NF-kB (IkB) proteins, activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and increased IL-8 gene transcription unknown but liberation of proteolytic fragments from host targets able to recognize PRR could be possible as described for TLR2 [ 44 ] . Serine proteases such as NE can induce IL-8 expression by bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 1 ) and leukotriene B4 expression by macrophages [ 42 , 45 ] . NE appears to be the most important regulatory factor present in the cystic fi brosis (CF) lung responsible for IL-8 expression because inhibition of NE activity in CF bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid (BALF) almost completely blocks IL-8 message in bronchial epithelium [ 40 ] . It has been shown that NE generally act at least in part via an IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-1/ myeloid differentiation factor-88/nuclear factor-\u03baB-dependent pathway in bronchial epithelial cells; this can be inhibited by a dominant negative variant of myeloid differentiation factor- 88 [ 42 ] . This gives new therapeutic approaches targeted at inhibiting the NE-activated intracellular pathways rather than NE itself. It is quite clear that expression of IL-8 and leukotriene B4 are responsible for neutrophil migration to the lung, and given the high neutrophil and NE burden present in the CF lung this has lead to the \"vicious cycle\" hypothesis whereby NE is the main player behind IL-8 production and neutrophil infl ux into the CF lung. From further experiments it has been found that an initial infl ammatory event can stimulate further infl ammation i.e., epithelial cell injury in mice leads to secretion of the murine homolog of IL-8, which in turn binds to an adhesive component of the extracellular matrix, syndecan-1 [ 46 ] . MMP-7 cleaves this syndecan-1-murine IL-8 complex and this is crucial for attracting neutrophils to the damaged epithelial surface (Fig. 2 ).",

It has been hypothesized that PR-3-mediated TNF processing may be an important mechanism in infl ammatory lung diseases [ 48 ]. PR-3 is able to degrade extracellular matrix, and its potential involvement in pulmonary infl ammatory disease has been demonstrated by the induction of emphysema in hamsters following intratracheal instillation [ 49 ] . PR-3 is also enhanced in the sputum of cystic fi brosis patients, and correlates with disease severity [ 50 ] . The main sources of PR-3 are neutrophils and it has been hypothesized that there would be an increased contribution of PR-3 to TNF processing in diseases with abundant alveolar neutrophils such as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) [ 48 ] . NSPs contribute to immune regulation also through the cleavage and activation of specifi c cellular receptors. NE, PR3, and CG can process the N-terminal extracellular domains of protease-activated receptors (PARs), which are a subfamily of related G-protein-coupled receptors [ 51 , 52 ] . These receptors are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and cells and, more especially, in platelets and endothelial cells. Processing of PAR extracellular domains occurs through exposure of a tethered ligand that allows the auto-activation of the receptor and subsequent activation of an intracellular signaling cascade via phospholipase C [ 51 , 52 ]. Four PARs have been identifi ed so far; three of them, PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4, can be activated by thrombin. Apart from thrombin, CG released from activated neutrophils can also activate PAR-4 at the surface of platelets and initiate their aggregation [ 53 ]. All three NSPs cleave PAR-1, which impairs their activation by thrombin [ 54 ] . Serine proteases cleave the amino acids at a specifi c site of the extracellular N-terminus of the molecule to expose a new N-terminal ligand domain that binds to another site on the same molecule, thereby activating the receptor. The amino acid sequence of each cleavage site is specifi c for the particular PAR, and mAb(monoclonal Antibody) assays for the protein and PCR assays for mRNA are available [ 55 ] . Activation of PAR2 results in the production and secretion of IL-8 and chemokine (C-Cmotif) ligand 2 [ 56 , 57 ].",

            "text": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases that form a family of extracellular matrix proteolytic enzymes. They are primarily responsible for the degradation of extracellular matrix components during the remodeling processes essential for normal tissue growth and repair. In the lung, inappropriate expression and excessive activity of several MMPs, including MMP-12, have been implicated in the tissue-destructive processes associated with chronic lung diseases, including COPD and asthma [ 68 -73 ] . It is well established that MMP-12 has defi nite role in the pathogenesis of COPD [ 74 ] . Patients suffering from COPD have increased secretion and activity of MMPs, especially MMP-2 and MMP-9, been identifi ed in infl ammatory cells and tissues isolated from those patients [ 75 ] . In our previous study, we found increased expression of MMP-2 in case of cadmium induced lung infl ammation in mice model [ 76 ] . Kundu [ 77 ] . Gelatinases (including MMP-2 and MMP-9) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases, degrade major components of the basement membrane such as gelatin and collagen IV, and exert deleterious effects on the epithelium and endothelium in the thin alveolar-capillary barrier [ 78 ] . A number of studies reveal that MMPs can also infl uence the progression of various infl ammatory processes and there are many non-matrix substrates for MMPs, such as chemokines, growth factors and receptors [ 79 ] . MMP-14 is a protease who does the processing of IL-8 by removing a pentapeptide from the N-terminus of the protein, resulting in a more biologically active form. MMP-9 also process IL-8 to a form 20-fold more active as a chemoattractant [ 80 , 81 ] . They process monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCPs) to produce antagonists of chemokine receptors, indicating a role for MMP-14 in dampening infl ammation [ 82 ] . Another potent proinfl ammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 that requires proteolytic processing before activation not only by caspase-1 but also several MMPs, including MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9. Interestingly, MMP-3 can degrade the mature IL-1beta cytokine, suggesting potentially dual roles for MMPs in either stimulating or inhibiting IL-1beta effects [ 83 ] . The mechanism by which MMPs control infl ammation is the regulation of chemokine gradients and that includes both the immobilization of chemokines to the components of extracellular matrix and the generation of chemotactic concentration gradients which provide indications for leukocyte migration. Thus, MMPs can indirectly control infl ux of infl ammatory cells by cleaving proteins in the pericellular environment that bind chemokines. One well established example of this mechanism is MMP7-dependent shedding of syndecan-1 in acute lung injury [ 46 ] . In response to lung injury, both CXCL1 (KC) and MMP7 are induced, and MMP7 sheds syndecan-1, a ubiquitous heparan sulfate proteoglycan, that releases the CXCL1syndecan-1 complex to generate a chemokine gradient. MMP7-null mice that lack this shedding are unable to create a CXCL1 gradient, and thus, neutrophils fail to effl ux into the alveolar space and instead remain in the perivascular space [ 84 ] .",

ADAMs family has been implicated in the control of membrane fusion, cytokine and growth factor shedding, and cell migration, as well as processes such as muscle development, fertilization, and cell fate determination. Pathologies such as infl ammation and cancer also involve ADAMs family members. ADAMs has been related to lung pathological processes such as cancer [ 90 ] , asthma [ 92 , 93 ] and idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis [ 94 ] . ADAMs can also modulate cell responses to various signals by acting as cell surface sheddase on membrane associated cytokines, apoptosis ligands, growth factors and receptors. In particular, sheddase activity has important physiological consequences. One of the most documented example is through the production of active tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), a potent inducer of innate infl ammatory responses. TNF-\u03b1 is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein of 26 kDa able to induce infl ammatory and cytotoxic effects after cell-to-cell contact [ 95 ] . ADAM-17 (also known as TNF-\u03b1 convertase enzyme or TACE) cleaves transmembrane TNF-\u03b1 to release the 17 kDa active soluble form of TNF-\u03b1 [ 96 ] . Importantly, ADAMs are also implicated in the shedding of most of the EGFR ligands (EGF, transforming growth factor (TGF)-a, heparin binding (HB)-EGF, betacellulin, epiregulin and amphiregulin (AR)) [ 89 ] . It has been reported that Adam17 knock-out mice presented developmental defects resembling those in animals lacking TGF-a, HB-EGF, AR, or the EGFR [ 97 -99 ] . In addition, sheddase activity on EGFR ligands has important physiological consequences for mucus production. Recently, it has been confi rmed that endothelial ADAM10 and ADAM17 are both required for microvascular permeability [ 100 ] . To investigate this phenomenon Dreymueller et al. (2012) did LPS treatment on HMVEC-L (Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells) and found there is release of soluble JAM-A by LPS-challenged HMVEC-L. Release of soluble JAM-A was 1.3-fold enhanced by 4 h of LPS stimulation, further increasing to 2.3-fold by stimulation for 24 h and was completely inhibited by GW280264X-treatment, capable of blocking tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) and the closely related disintegrin-like metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10). The knockdown of ADAM10 or ADAM17 by shRNA indicated the involvement of ADAM17 and to a lesser extent of ADAM10 in JAM-A release. They further examined whether ADAM10/17 activity might infl uence transendothelial migration of neutrophils. The inhibitor GW280264X reduced transmigration in response to the neutrophil-attracting cytokine IL-8 by 70 %. Silencing or knock-out of either ADAM10 or ADAM17 alone was suffi cient to abrogate transmigration in response to IL-8. Thus, endothelial ADAM10 and ADAM17 are both required for microvascular permeability and for IL-8-mediated transmigration of neutrophils in vitro .",

The diagnosis of IPF is made by surgical lung biopsy, and the histopathological features include the presence of patchy infl ammatory cells, foci of proliferating fi broblasts and myofi broblasts, and collagen deposition [ 117 , 118 ] . From a study it has been observed that MMP-2 activity is increased in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells treated for 48 h by TGF-\u03b2 stimulation [ 119 ] because TGF-\u03b2 plays a key role in stimulation of fi broblast proliferation and has been implicated in progression of IPF [ 120 ] . It has been postulated that NE may be involved in the early stages of lung infl ammation during the development of pulmonary fi brosis [ 121 ] . Neutrophil elastase acts as a putative link between emphysema and fi brosis and this dual role of NE has been reported from a recent study that has highlighted NE as a common pathogenic mechanism linking pulmonary emphysema and fi brosis [ 122 ] . This study was done in two animal models in which emphysema and fi brosis were induced either by bleomycin (BLM) or by chronic exposure to cigarette smoke. In order to study whether BLM-induced lesion is protease-dependent or not, a group of mice was treated with 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fl uoride hydrochloride (a serine proteinase inhibitor active against neutrophil elastase). In DBA/2 mice that develop both emphysema and fi brosis after chronic cigarette-smoke exposure, the presence of NE in alveolar structures is also associated with a positive immunohistochemical reaction of both TGF-\u03b2 and TGF-\u03b1 [ 123 ] . These results strongly suggest that neutrophil elastase may be a common pathogenic link between emphysema and fi brosis, acting as a regulatory factor in the generation of soluble cytokines with mitogenic activity for mesenchymal cells resulting either in emphysema or in fi brosis or both [ 122 ] . A recent study has provided evidence that different interstitial levels of NE burden in emphysema may be associated with different routes of collagen clearance (intracellular vs. extracellular) and different degrees of remodeling of the ECM in emphysema [ 124 ] . This point merits further investigation. The implication of NE in lung destruction and repair and its pathogenic role in emphysema and fi brosis could lead to a novel approach for therapeutic interventions.",

In a study of 23 children with CF, BAL fl uid concentrations of MMP8 and MMP9 were higher in untreated children and lower in those who were treated with DNase [ 127 ] . In children with stable CF, there is a signifi cant inverse relationship between MMP-9 and lung function, as measured by FEV1. Furthermore, levels of MMP-9 are higher in sputum of asymptomatic children with CF compared with controls, suggesting that MMP-9 and total neutrophil count may be useful markers of airway injury and airfl ow obstruction in persons with CF [ 126 ] .

It has been studied that on the basis of molar concentration, among these proteases, CG is the most potent protease with maximal degradation occurring within 60 min at a concentration of 250 nM. NE also shows potent activity at 250 nM but required up to 4 h for complete degradation of sIL-6R to occur. PR3 was the least active protease with minimal degradation of sIL-6R occurring in the presence of 1,000 nM protease after 1 h and complete degradation being observed after 4 h in the presence of 500 nM of protease. If we consider CF lung, unregulated proteolytic activity is the main contributor to pathology of this disease and is also responsible for reduced expression and activity of a number of important components of the immune response [ 130 ] . Targeting of IL-6 by NSPs [ 128 ] has previously been suggested as an explanation for the surprisingly low pulmonary expression of IL-6 in CF patients [ 131 ] however, this is the fi rst study to show specifi c proteolysis of this cytokine by serine proteases in CF BALF [ 129 ] .",

Early in the initiation of ALI and ARDS, massive number of neutrophils accumulates in the vasculature of the lung. Neutrophils and their cytotoxic products, including oxidants and proteases, have main pathological importance in ALI and ARDS. It has been observed that there is increased elastolytic activity [ 133 ] in patients with ARDS [ 134 ] . Increased levels of HNE in plasma and in BAL have also been observed with at-risk patients who later developed ALI [ 135 , 136 ] . Pathologic effects of HNE are associated with microvascular injury, causing endothelial damage, increased capillary permeability, and interstitial edema. HNE may also potentiate the infl ammatory response by increasing the expression and release of cytokines [ 137 ] and by increasing mucin production [ 138 ] . In experimental animal models, intratracheal administration of exogenous HNE induces lung hemorrhage and ALI, whereas administration of pharmacological HNE inhibitors prevents lung injury, which further supports the role of NSPs in lung injury [ 22 , 139 , 140 ] . Owen et al. (2004) propose an interesting role of MMP-8 that it may be anti-infl ammatory during acute lung injury, because MMP-8 null mice given intratracheal LPS have signifi cantly greater accumulation of neutrophils in the alveolar space than wild-type mice [ 141 ] .",

Expression of several MMPs has been associated with asthma; enhancement of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-9 all have been found in sputum and BAL from patients with asthma [ 69 ] . With severe asthmatic conditions, patients have increased MMP9 activity in BAL relative to that from patients with mild asthma or control patients. Wenzel et al. [ 145 ] found an increase in MMP-9 activity in the subepithelial basement membrane that is accompanied by higher TGF-\u03b2. These studies suggest that in patients with severe asthma, neutrophils play a key role in lung remodeling because they express both MMP-9 and TGF-\u03b2, which are involved in breakdown and repair of tissue, respectively. In asthma, MMP-9 is expressed in bronchial epithelium and submucosa, where its abundance correlates with tissue eosinophil number [ 146 ] because MMP-9 is also produced by eosinophils, macrophages, and neutrophils [ 147 , 148 ] . In sputum, concentration of MMP-9 is positively correlated with neutrophil number [ 149 ] and also with the cumulative macrophage, neutrophil, and eosinophil count [ 150 ] during asthma. BAL taken from asthmatic patients after allergen challenge increases the mitogenic indices even more than a normal patient's BAL [ 151 ] . This phenomenon could contribute to the airway remodeling observed in patients with chronic asthma; however, the pathway underlying the proliferation remains unclear. EGFR, TGF-\u03b2, or platelet-derived growth factors are all candidates based on their presence in lung during disease and their relationship to various MMPs [ 152 ] .",

Several lines of evidence propose that NE aims specifi cally at a variety of regulatory functions in local infl ammatory processes but their relevance under various pathophysiological conditions still remains poorly understood and need further investigation.

This results in sustained infl ammation and predisposition to infection. One way to treat such protease-mediated events in chronic infective lung disease is with antiprotease therapy, which neutralizes excessive extracellular protease activity without compromising the normal physiologic role of proteases. Antiprotease trials have been performed using \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin and secretary leukoprotease inhibitor, both of which have successfully inhibited NE activity in vivo in CF and \u03b11-antitrypsin defi ciency [ 178 -180 ] .

Neutrophil Elastase (NE) induces interleukin-8 (IL-8) synthesis, resulting in chemoattraction of neutrophils to the respiratory tract. MT1-matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 14 processes IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and MMP-7 cleaves the syndecan-1-IL-8 complex to generate active IL-8, which in turn acts as a neutrophil chemoattractant. MMP-12 released from macrophages also helps in chemoattraction of different infl ammatory cell",

Functions of NE are not only concerned with degrading bacteria [ 31 -33 ] and extracellular matrix molecules, they also operate on various bioactive molecules including chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and cell surface receptors [ 34 -36 ], thus the \"deleterious\" concept of NE has changed towards a multifunctional molecule able to regulate infl ammatory process and immune responses. Indeed, extracellular NE (free, chromatin-bound or membrane-bound) participates in: (1) direct killing of bacteria [ 31 -33 ]; (2) processing and release of chemokines, cytokines and growth factors [ 34 , 35 ], (3) modulation of immune cell activity through interaction with cell surface receptors [ 36 , 37 ], (4) mucus secretion [ 38 ]. Proteases can also modulate cytokine activity and release from immune cells through mechanisms independent of cytokine receptors. For example, it has been shown that NE induces the release of IL-8 from lung epithelial cells [ 39 -42 ] through a MyD88/IRAK/TRAF-6-dependent pathway [ 42 ] that also involves TLR4 [ 39 ] and also through EGFR MAPK pathway (Fig. 1 ) [ 43 ].
