Several host factors affect antimicrobial treatment outcome and are responsible for progression of disease after infection, poor treatment response, tissue damage, long-term functional disability, and increased mortality. These factors include immune dysregulation from any cause (aberrant or excess host inflammatory response to infection, stress, immunosuppressive drugs, poor living conditions, socioeconomic factors, micronutrient deficiencies, HIV, malnutrition, and alcohol or substance misuse) and comorbidity with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.1\n",

A host-directed therapy is any product that can augment host defence mechanisms or modulate excessive inflammation, or both, leading to improved clinical treatment outcomes as shown by reduced morbidity, mortality, and end-organ damage, and long-term functional recovery. A range of host-directed therapies have been identified with different mechanisms of action (figure 1\n), and they are now regarded as viable adjuncts to standard antimicrobial treatment. Host-directed therapies can improve host cellular responses to pathogens, target disease-causing virulence factors (figure 2\n), and activate innate and adaptive immune responses and immunological memory (figure 3\n).2 Examples of host-directed therapies include commonly used and affordable drugs for non-communicable diseases with good safety profiles, immunomodulatory agents, biologics, nutritional products, and cellular therapy using the patient's own immune or mesenchymal stromals cells (table 1\n).

For decades, the notion that M tuberculosis is the sole cause of the continuing worldwide tuberculosis pandemic has led to a focus on treatment of patients with tuberculosis with WHO-recommended combination antituberculosis antibiotic therapy. This focus still thrives, although there are about 2 billion people in the world with latent tuberculosis infection who do not develop active disease.89 Furthermore, the substantial decline in tuberculosis in Europe and North America in the first half of the 19th century occurred well before the antibiotic era. In 2014, an estimated 1\u00b75 million people died of tuberculosis and there were an estimated 450 000 cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis,89 suggesting that host factors have an important role in achieving anti-M tuberculosis immune responses. M tuberculosis is largely intracellular in nature, and intact T-cell responses (T-helper-1 [Th1] CD4 cytotoxic lymphocytes, CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes, and natural killer T cells) and interferon-\u03b3 production are needed to restrict M tuberculosis growth.90 Pulmonary tissue pathology, substantial tissue destruction, and subdued protective anti-M tuberculosis immune responses are noted in patients with tuberculosis who are predominantly affected by tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b3-mediated inflammation.91\n",

Preclinical assessment of azithromycin in mice after secondary S pneumoniae infection following primary exposure to influenza A virus potentiated anti-inflammatory effects marked by reduction in neutrophil influx, and promoted dampening of immunopathological outcome in the lungs.21 Retrospective and prospective studies22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 have shown that macrolide-containing antibiotic regimens decrease mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, although other studies28, 29, 30 have shown no significant benefit from these regimens. Addition of a macrolide to a fluoroquinolone seems to provide some improvement in survival,31 suggesting a host-directed effect. Analyses in patients with community-acquired pneumonia with bacteraemia of all causes32 or community-acquired pneumonia with severe sepsis24 showed that benefit specific to macrolides was not only restricted to pneumococcal bacteraemia but was also shown for Gram-negative bacterial infections.24, 32 Findings suggest that macrolides provide benefit mainly to patients with more severe illness.4, 22, 24, 26, 27\n",

Antibiotics do not substantially affect the course of whooping cough disease unless treatment is started early after symptom onset. Many patients develop long-term pulmonary damage. Immunotherapy with antipertussis toxin antibodies might confer protection against more severe forms of whooping cough. Halperin and colleagues36 investigated the use of multiple doses of intravenous antipertussis immunoglobulin in 25 infants with pertussis infection and noted an increase in serum antipertussis antibody titres, a decline in lymphocytosis, and a reduction in paroxysmal coughing compared with baseline; however, findings from more recent studies37 of antipertussis immunoglobulin were not promising. Manipulation of the sphingosine-1-phosphate signalling pathway, involved in several immunological processes including lymphocyte trafficking, might have therapeutic benefits in reversing the pathological outcome in pertussis disease (appendix).35\n",

This immune reconstitution, however, does not purge latent viral reservoirs in the host, nor sustain HIV-specific CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte repertoires.145 Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is an important clinical manifestation in patients with HIV\u2013tuberculosis co-infection early after initiation of ART.146 Overt Th1-mediated immune responses result in pro-inflammatory cytokine storms (of which interleukin 6 is an important component147) and hyperactivation of immune cells, mediating extensive tissue damage. At present, repurposing of histone deacetylase inhibitors\u2014eg, vorinostat, panobinostat, and valproic acid\u2014has shown promise as host-directed therapy for improved clinical management of HIV/AIDS. These clinically approved drugs are able to reactivate latent virus reservoirs in the host and expose new virus progeny to ART as well as immune attack.148 The encouraging results of early-phase clinical trials of histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment of latent HIV infection could revolutionise ART.148 Since PD-1 expression on HIV-specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes is a barrier to effective antiviral immune responses in patients with AIDS,44 timely blockade of the PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway could be a viable option to pursue.45 In-vitro blockade of PD-L1 has already been shown to improve anti-HIV CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, marked by increased proliferation and production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules.149 Faster recovery of immune competence in lymphopenic hosts has been seen in HIV-positive patients after treatment with recombinant interleukin 7.150\n",

In one patient receiving nivolumab only, a transient, grade 4 rise in alanine transaminase concentration was concomitant with maximum HCV viral load reduction (4\u00b755 log IU/mL) 22 days after treatment. Another patient, who also had diabetes mellitus and was receiving metformin treatment, had an increase in blood glucose concentrations, requiring insulin therapy. Anti-PD-1 therapy has been used for treatment of melanoma and other solid cancers,156 including HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma in combination with anti-CTLA-4 (NCT01658878). HCV-infected hepatocytes secrete newly formed viruses bound to apolipoprotein B (apoB),157 thus making increased apoB expression a risk factor for infection and progression to active hepatitis, and a potential target for host-directed therapy. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is highly expressed in the liver and has an important role in fatty-acid metabolism. Notably, increased levels of circulating miR-122 in serum samples from patients with HCV infection (genotypes 1 and 3) qualifies it as a disease biomarker and target for host-directed therapy.56 A phase 2 clinical trial of miravirsen (SPC3649; Santaris Pharma, H\u00f8rsholm Municipality, Denmark), an antisense oligonucleotide targeting miR-122, in patients with chronic HCV infection, has recently been completed (NCT01200420), and previous preclinical assessment showed promising antiviral effects.57\n",

Many patients with influenza succumb to extensive lung pathology or secondary bacterial pneumonia, and resistance to current neuraminidase inhibitors presents a major hurdle to management of future pandemics. Immunosuppressive treatment with etoposide to dampen the cytokine storm-induced lung pathology was clinically beneficial in patients with severe influenza infection.108, 109 DAS181 (fludase; Ansun Biopharma, San Diego, CA, USA) is a sialidase fusion peptide that cleaves off the sialic acid residues on host epithelial cell-surface receptors. Following approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DAS181 has been used in two HSCT recipients with parainfluenza infection; the first patient died whereas the second recovered.66 Clinical benefit and reduction of viral load has been reported from a phase 2 clinical trial of DAS181 in patients with pneumonia caused by either influenza B or the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain.67 Several immunomodulatory drugs,62, 63 statins,62 angiotensin-II-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and PPAR\u03b3 agonists (glitazones and fibrates, respectively), and adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase agonists (eg, metformin) have been suggested to modify the host response to severe influenza to improve survival,62 since these interventions have been shown to reduce mortality in mice infected with influenza virus. In an observational study of more than 3000 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed influenza, statins reduced the number of deaths in hospital and within 30 days of discharge by 41%.64 An observational study showed that inpatient treatment with angiotensin-II-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins reduced 30-day pneumonia mortality by 53%, 42%, and 32%, respectively.158\n",

The lung pathology seen in patients with MERS probably represents the end result of a fine balance of host immune and MERS-CoV interactions. In-vitro laboratory investigation identified the membrane-bound form of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 to be the cardinal host-cell receptor for virus entry.76 Pneumonia is a common feature in patients with MERS and the high mortality caused by MERS-CoV is attributable to acute lung injury or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is associated with leaky alveolar\u2013capillary interfaces with pulmonary oedema, hypoxia, polymorphonuclear leucocytes or lymphocytic cellular infiltrates, and an aberrant immune response, with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon \u03b3, which results in further tissue damage and deterioration of lung function. Analysis of serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from patients who died from MERS-CoV infection showed non-productive inflammatory immune responses and induction of interleukin 6 and interleukin 17A.76 Patients with acute lung injury or ARDS died from the disease. Blockade of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 17A and interleukin 6 during severe disease might be useful as adjunct therapy and needs to be assessed in clinical trials.

Drug treatments have limited efficacy, have to be used for lengthy periods of time, and the systemic side-effects sometimes outweigh any clinical benefits. Thus, successful treatment of diseases caused by intracellular pathogens might need combination therapies and effective delivery systems. Imiquimod and resiquimod are currently used for treatment of leishmaniasis; both trigger Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7-mediated innate immune responses, inducing production of interleukin 6, type 1 interferons, and TNF\u03b3,82 and thus act in a host-directed manner. Overproduction of TNF\u03b3 in Leishmania braziliensis infection contributes to mucosal tissue damage, consequently leading to development of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.84 In this case, a combination of antileishmanial drugs and anti-TNF\u03b3 (adalimumab) during active L braziliensis infection might yield a clinical response. In preclinical studies, delivery of nanocapsulated doxorubicin (in a formulation that included chondroitin sulfate) to hamsters increased killing of leishmanial promastigotes via augmentation of Th1-mediated immune responses via induction of interferon \u03b3, TNF\u03b3, and interleukin 2 release in addition to direct antiparasitic activity.83 Sequential chemoimmunotherapy, with a single low dose of liposomal amphotericin B and a novel T-cell-epitope-enriched DNA vaccine candidate (LEISHDNAVAX; Mologen AG, Germany) was tested as host-directed therapy. The vaccine candidate boosted the efficacy of a single suboptimal dose of liposomal amphotericin B in C57BL/6 mice.169 Polyhexanide is a cationic polymer, which is able to directly kill Leishmania major and to enhance host-directed killing by improving the delivery of immunomodulatory nucleic acids. Polyhexanide spontaneously binds CpG ODN (short synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides comprising cytosine triphosphate [C] and guanine triphosphate [G] residues in sequential order), forming stable nanopolyplexes that enhanced uptake of CpG ODN, potentiated antimicrobial killing, and reduced host-cell toxicity of polyhexanide.170 These findings warrant further investigation.",

Interferon-\u03b3-induced apolipoprotein 1 is a known host factor with antitrypanosomal activity. Thus, activating the immune system at an early stage with interferon \u03b3 could help control burden of parasitaemia via different effector mechanisms.

Interleukin 6 and interleukin 1\u03b2 also seem to have an important role early after infection with Schistosoma spp cercariae.87 In interleukin-10-deficient mice repeatedly infected with Schistosoma mansoni, CD4 T-cell activity was more pronounced, targeted, and efficient, upon exposure to schistosoma antigen preparation.174 This finding, if extrapolated to human beings, would suggest that multiple exposures to S mansoni might reduce T-cell responsiveness in an interleukin-10-dependent manner and hence, weaken productive cellular immune responses. Use of interleukin 2 and interferon \u03b3 might help to recover T-cell responses in patients in endemic countries. Notably, the use of Th2 cytokines such as interleukin 25 and interleukin 33 in a mixture with schistosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and peroxiredoxin in a post-exposure vaccination attempt resulted in immense reduction of migrating cercariae in S mansoni-infected mice.88\n",

Activation and recruitment of antigen-presenting cells (ie, dendritic cells and macrophages) via therapy with the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IFN\u03b3-induced protein (IP-10), among others, could amplify the antimicrobial immune response. Several anticancer drugs (ie, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel) can potentiate antigen-specific CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in patients by inducing production of interleukin (IL) 12, tumour necrosis factor \u03b3 (TNF\u03b3), and IL 6. Immune checkpoint inhibition by blocking the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway activates antigen-specific T cells. In-vitro selection and expansion of pathogen-specific autologous T-cell subsets (antigen-specific CD4 T cells and CD8 CTLs) can allow for reinfusion into the patient after confirmation of activity. Blockade of cell surface-bound signalling molecules, such as the receptors for IL 6 and neuropilin 1 (NRP-1), may potentiate specific T-cell responses. Removal of excess inflammatory cytokines by use of monoclonal antibodies, or depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) with cytotoxic agents (eg, cyclophosphamide and etoposide) dampens destructive inflammation in the target organs, and might re-orientate Mycobacterium tuberculosis-targeted immune responses (T-helper-1 [Th1] and CD8 CTLs). Histone deacetylase inhibitors, valproic acid, and vorinostat, might reprogramme non-productive Th2 cells to antigen-specific Th1 cells. Infusion of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) could neutralise the local cytokine milieu, promote tissue repair, and orchestrate antigen-specific T-cell responses, in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Host-cell surface receptors used by pathogens for entry could be targeted by host-directed therapies. AMP=antimicrobial peptide. BCR=B-cell receptor. M-CSF=macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
