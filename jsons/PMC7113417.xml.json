The top 50 most cited or occurring items from each slice were selected. The Pathfinder network method was used to streamline the network and to map the visualization analysis. The network revealed 244 nodes and 517 lines. In Figure 2, the thicker circle indicates a higher level of between-study centrality. In general, a study with a centrality value equal to or greater than 0.10 can be considered a key study; therefore, the key studies were [Subbarao I, 2008]\n26\n (0.22), followed by [Einav S, 2006]\n27\n (0.19) and [Gillett B, 2008]\n28\n (0.16).

The results indicated a significant increase in the number of publications worldwide on this topic; the publications and citations in 2011 (67 and 357) were significantly higher than in 2010 (45 and 197). This increase may be due to several major disasters. The year 2011 was the first year after the Haiti earthquake, and much of the related research focused on the implementation and development of international medical rescue.\n32\n\n\u2013\n\n33\n It was also the third year after the Wenchuan earthquake, research on which mainly focused on disease classification and patient management of the patients.\n34\n\n\u2013\n\n35\n Finally, 2011 was the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks; the relevant research mainly focused on post-disaster effects, including respiratory and mental health problems, among survivors and rescuers.\n36\n\n\u2013\n\n37\n The United States, Japan, and China published the most research on disaster medicine. This may be because the frequent occurrence of disasters in these countries has caused serious casualties and property losses.\n35\n\n,\n\n38\n\n\u2013\n\n40\n Likewise, these countries have participated in international humanitarian relief efforts many times, so they have a wealth of medical rescue experience.\n41\n\n\u2013\n\n43\n The top 10 studies (by number of citations) all emphasized 2 categories of disaster medicine, except for [Leaning J, 2007],\n17\n which summarizes the challenges and pressures posed by natural disasters to public health. These categories are disaster rescue\n16\n\n,\n\n20\n\n\u2013\n\n23\n and post-disaster health effects.\n18\n\n\u2013\n\n19\n\n,\n\n24\n\n\u2013\n\n25\n\n",

Journals can determine where they stand in relation to other journals in publishing articles related to disaster medicine. Governments and policy-makers can also ascertain the most effective countries and institutions in the world in this field, and this analysis may assist them to apprehend and predict the hotspots and dynamic directions of disaster medicine research and to target resources so that further developments can be encouraged, supported, and monitored.",
