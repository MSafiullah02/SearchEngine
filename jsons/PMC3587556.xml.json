            "text": "Cryotherapy for primary and secondary malignant liver tumors has been reported to be effective, compared with best supportive care[3,4]. But patients frequently develop recurrence or disease progression after the regional treatments[5]. Among patients with advanced disease who do not qualify for surgical or liver transplantation therapies, the only non-chemotherapeutic treatment that has been shown to increase survival is sorafenib[6]. A phase III, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial of sorafenib showed survival benefit in patients with advanced HCC in 2007[7]. It can also be used in combination with local therapies, such as cryoablation. Rather than gross advanced tumors, tiny residual tumors after cryoablation may be more effectively treated by cytostatic agents like sorafenib. Thus, the combination of sorafenib and cryoablation may deliver a better treatment outcome in unresectable advanced HCC. Although interest has been focused on the use of the drug as adjuvant treatment after cryoablation, no such data have been established to date in HCC. In this paper, we report the results of our prospective study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and acceptable tolerability of sorafenib as adjuvant treatment after cryoablation in the treatment of unresectable HCC.",

CT was used to verify placement of the multiple cryoprobes. The tumors were frozen at maximum flow rate for about 15 min, thawed for 5 min and then refrozen. Two cycles (consisting of freezing-heating-freezing) were used for each procedure. Duration of the freezing time was based on growth of the iceball relative to the tumor (mean, 15 min; range, 10\u201320 min). Limited unenhanced CT scans were obtained approximately every 3 min during the freezing time using 1.25 mm collimation to accurately monitor growth of the iceball. The probes were removed after thawing with helium and the inserting sites were pressed for several minutes. CT scan was performed to determine the effect of cryoablation.",

            "text": "The difficulty in treating moderate to large tumors is often attributed to the powerful heat-sink effect of tumor blood flow, which draws heat away from the tumor site, substantially limiting the size and uniformity of tumor destruction[14]. Thus, concomitant administration of antivascular or antiangiogenic pharmaceutical agents capable of reducing tumor blood flow might be of considerable clinical value. One potential candidate is the new group of antiangiogenic agents that have been developed to block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor signaling and subsequent tumor angiogenesis[15]. In this study, all patients received sorafenib orally 400 mg twice daily on a continuous dosing schedule at the second day after percutaneous cryoablation. The 6.4% response rate and 43.6% disease-stabilization rate in this study are encouraging and comparable to the results reported in the phase III Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP) trial and the latest Asian phase III trials[16]. All patients enrolled in these two pivotal trials had Child-Pugh A cirrhosis with favorable clinical parameters.",

            "text": "However, in daily clinical practice in most Asian countries, the patients with advanced HCC who are encountered are HBV carriers with suboptimal liver function, often Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis. Most patients enrolled in our study had poor overall prognosis because of worsening underlying cirrhosis (Child\u2013Pugh class B) or in infiltrating, far-advanced HCC. A recent phase 2 open-label study of single agent sorafenib in treating advanced HCC with similar study populations like us showed 8% response rate and 18% disease- stabilization rate[17]. The higher disease-stabilization rate and DCR rate observed in our study may be contributed to the necrosis induced by cryoablation and also sorafenib. Although RECIST[10] were utilized to measure tumor response, it may not be the best indicator for the treatment of this study, and enhances tumor stability rather than tumor shrinkage[18]. Cryoablation can induce coagulation necrosis. In addition, Sorafenib is also better related to the tumor necrosis documented in many patients, as has been demonstrated in studies with other biological agents, such as sunitinib and imatinib. New response criteria combining tumor density on contrast enhanced CT, as a measure of tumor necrosis, with conventional dimension measurement will probably allow better characterization of cryoablation and sorafenib response in HCC[19].",

The results were encouraging compared with the previous studies with sorafenib monotherapy[7] but less satisfactory than that of the randomized phase II study of sorafenib plus doxorubicin with a median TTP of 8.5 months and a median OS of 14.0 months[20]. This is expected, as the study population in our study had poor overall prognosis because of advanced tumors. In patients achieved PR, the duration of sorafenib therapy was 7.2 months whereas in 34 patients showing the best SD responses, the median duration of sorafenib therapy was 5.1 months (P=0.032). This interaction is likely mediated by the well-documented antiangiogenic properties of sorafenib. A reduction in blood flow could eliminate heterogeneous \u201cheat sinks\u201d that can occur in tumors of all sizes, thereby improving uniformity of cold deposition during cryoablation and potentially reducing the rate of incomplete treatment. TACE may also decrease the blood flow to the tumor. One advantage of performing TACE before cryoablation is a possible reduction in postoperative bleeding, as well as an increase in the rate of tumor ablation[21]. But in this study, there were no significant differences in terms of clinical benefits and OS between TACE and non-TACE before cryoablation procedure. It may be because of the possibility of rapid recanalization or collateralization after chemoembolization.",

These results were most likely related to a high proportion of patients with suboptimal baseline liver function as a result of more advanced cirrhosis in this study and the destruction of tumor cells induced by cryoablation. The commonest liver function derangement observed was the change in transaminase levels. The majority of the liver derangements induced by cryoablation and sorafenib were transient and improved after stopping sorafenib. Furthermore, there are recent reports regarding the reactivation of hepatitis B infection in chronic hepatitis B carriers who received targeted therapy alone for the treatment of underlying malignancy[24, 25]. Thus, it is possible that the administration of sorafenib will likewise lead to the reactivation of the underlying hepatitis B infection and result in worsening liver function, because most patients with advanced HCC in Asia are chronic hepatitis B carriers. In this study, the HBV infection rate was as high as 80.8%. As two episodes of variceal bleeding developed during treatment, screening and prophylaxis of gastroesophageal varices are necessary at the time of treatment entry, although variceal bleeding is likely a progressive complication of portal hypertensive cirrhosis, and not directly associated with sorafenib use.",
