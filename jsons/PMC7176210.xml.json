Persistence of elevated numbers of neutrophils correlates with worsening gas exchange and with poor\nprognosis [7]. The regulation of neutrophil lifespan is known to be critical\nfor maintaining an effective host response and preventing excessive inflammation. One of the mechanisms that controls the\nnumber of neutrophils in the lung is the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, neutrophils are less susceptible to undergo\napoptosis under hypoxic conditions, as occurs in the alveoli in ARDS. In this line, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)\noxygen-sensing pathway has been shown to play a role in prolonging neutrophil survival during hypoxia. The expression and\ntranscriptional activity of HIF are regulated by the oxygen-sensitive prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3) [8]. This suggests that modulation of HIF and PHD1-3 expression aimed at enhancing neutrophil\napoptosis may be a potential approach to downregulate inflammation in the early phase of ARDS.",

Neutrophil elastase is a serine\nprotease stored in the azurophilic granules of leukocytes that has been implicated in the pathology of ARDS. Neutrophil\nelastase seems to promote inflammation, endothelial and epithelial cell injury, extracellular matrix damage and collagen\ndeposition that leads pulmonary fibrosis [9\u201311]. Sivelestat was the first neutrophil elastase inhibitor tested in humans and it\nsuppressed the production of neutrophil elastase and interleukin (IL)-8, resulting in improved respiratory function in\npatients with ARDS secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass [12]. In animal models\nof lung fibrosis, sivelestat not only decreased inflammatory cell recruitment in the acute phase, but also reduced collagen\ndeposition in lung parenchyma in the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS resulting in less fibrosis and better static\ncompliance of the lung. This beneficial effect was also associated with a decrease in transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21\nactivation and expression of phospho-SMAD2/3, which are mechanisms involved in lung fibrosis [9, 11]. AZD9668 (N-{[5-(methanesulfonyl)pyridin-2-yl]methyl}-6-methyl-5-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carboxamide)\nis another novel neutrophil elastase inhibitor that can be administered orally. It exerts selective and rapid inhibition of\nneutrophil elastase that is also reversible. Oral administration of AZD9668 to mice or rats prevented human neutrophil\nelastase-induced lung tissue injury as assessed by decreased matrix protein degradation products in BAL fluid and reduced\ninflammatory responses in the lung in acute and chronic lung injury models. Therefore, neutrophil elastase inhibitors may\nbe drugs that could potentially reduce lung inflammation and diminish structural and functional pulmonary changes in human\nARDS [13].",

S1P is a potent angiogenic factor that\npreserves human lung endothelial cell integrity and barrier function [16]\npreventing the alveolar flooding demonstrated in animal models of ARDS. S1P is a naturally occurring bioactive\nsphingolipid that acts extracellularly (via its G protein-coupled receptors, S1P1-5) and intracellularly on various\ntargets. The synthesis of S1P is catalyzed by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, and the degradation of S1P is mediated by\nlipid S1P phosphatases and S1P lyase, contributing to the control of the S1P cellular responses [15, 16] (Fig. 1). S1P enhances vascular barrier function through a series of cellular events initiated by\nactivation of its G-protein coupled receptor, S1P1, and the subsequent downstream activation of Rho and Rac1. Activation\nof these intracellular signals results in endothelial cytoskeletal reorganization to form strong cortical actin rings in\nthe cell periphery, and reinforcement of focal adhesions and paracellular junctional complexes (cadherin, paxillin,\ncatenins, zona occludens), that prevent excessive vascular permeability [16,\n17].",

ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels and thereby\nfunctions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system (Fig. 2). Capillary\nblood vessels in the lung are a major site of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body [28]. ACE, angiotensin II and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) induce apoptosis in\nthe alveolar wall, alter alveolar capillary barrier integrity leading to lung edema, and promote collagen deposition, which\ncan result in lung fibrosis with the consequent impairment of lung function. In contrast, ACE2 and the angiotensin II\ntype 2 receptor (AT2) protect against all these effects (Fig. 2). Indeed,\ninhibiting ACE and AT1 as well as increasing ACE2 and AT2 activity attenuated lung injury in several animal models of ARDS,\nand may represent novel approaches for the treatment of ARDS [29\u201332].",

            "text": "Many drugs targeting endotoxin or the endotoxin-induced cytokine storm have been developed with therapeutic purposes\nin sepsis and sepsis-induced ARDS. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is activated by LPS or endotoxin, the major component of the\nouter membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and constitutes a potent inflammatory stimulus implicated in septic shock and\nseptic-induced ARDS. Activation of TLR4 by LPS depends on LPS binding protein (LBP)-catalyzed extraction and transfer of\nindividual LPS molecules from aggregated LPS to CD14 and then from CD14 to MD2, followed by engagement and dimerization of\nTLR4. TLR4 signaling may also be activated by stimuli other than LPS. Chemical (acid aspiration) or virus (influenza)\ninsults may cause ALI via the generation of host-derived, oxidized phospholipids that potently stimulate\nTLR-4 [33]. Eritoran is a potent, well-tolerated, synthetic TLR4 antagonist\nthat protects against influenza-induced ARDS in mice, improving the survival of these animals even when administered as\nlate as 6 days post-infection. Eritoran binds to CD14, which inhibits ligand binding to MD2:TLR4 complexes preventing TLR4\ndimerization and activation [34]. In viral infection, eritoran blocks oxidized\nphospholipid-induced TLR4 signaling, mitigates the subsequent cytokine storm, and also helps to control viral\ntiter. Despite the lack of benefit in severe septic patients (ACCESS trial) [38], eritoran could still be effective in influenza infection and, perhaps, in ALI mediated\nby non-infectious agents, but its most effective timing and dosing remain unknown. Based on endotoxin challenge studies in\nanimals, the prophylactic or very early administration of eritoran in patients at-risk or with ARDS could be more effective\nin controlling the \u2018sepsis cascade\u2019. Antagonism of TLR4 signaling could therefore become a useful therapy for\nARDS [35, 36].",

Hyaluronan and its degradation products, produced by hyaluronidase enzymes and\nreactive oxygen species (ROS), are implicated in different aspects of the ALI process. The different activities of\nhyaluronan and its degradation products are regulated by multiple hyaluronan-binding proteins, including CD44, TLR4,\nhyaluronan-binding protein 2 (HABP2), and receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM). Recent research indicates\nthat exogenous administration of high molecular weight hyaluronan can serve as a novel therapeutic intervention for lung\ndiseases, including LPS-induced ALI, sepsis/VILI, and airway hyperactivity [48].",

For example, nano-sized micelles have been developed to trigger receptor expressed on myeloid\ncells 1 (TREM-1), ROS and heat shock protein (Hsp)90, all effectors thought to be involved in ALI. The main limitations of\nsome peptide drugs for clinical use are the short half-life (minutes) and their water-insolubility. To overcome these\nlimitations, some groups have developed micellar-targeted peptides in which the peptide drug remains in its active form for\nlonger (hours) and increases its stability and bioavailability [49]. These\nlong-acting micellar nanomedicines have provided significant advancement in the treatment of ARDS in experimental models,\nwhich could be extended to the clinical setting. Another advance is the novel nanovesicle aerosols composed of non-lamellar\nphospholipids that were developed as pulmonary surfactant aerosols and have been successfully used as therapy in mice with\nacid-induced lung injury. Currently existing intratracheal surfactants are ineffective because they are inactivated by\nalbumin leakage and other mechanisms. The nanovesicle aerosols of non-lamellar lipids improve the resistance of pulmonary\nsurfactants to inhibition, and may therefore be promising as a non-invasive aerosol therapy in ALI [50].",

Multiple biochemical and biological targets, however, have been identified that could\ngive rise to future drug discovery and development. Several aspects should be taken into account in order to guarantee the\nefficacy of those potential new drugs. Better stratification may help to identify subgroups of patients with ARDS that\nbenefit from targeted interventions, given the heterogeneity of patients with ARDS and the multiple etiologies of this\ndisease (direct versus indirect ARDS). Combinations of different therapeutic strategies could also improve outcomes for\nthese patients compared with therapies based on single agents. Finally, we also need to optimize the dose, timing and\nroute of administration as well as to determine the potential toxicity of the novel pharmacologic agents for their future\nuse in the management of patients with ARDS.",
