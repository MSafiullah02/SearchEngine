CPV was recently included, together with feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), mink enteritis virus (MEV) and raccoon parvovirus (RaPV), in the unique species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, within the Protoparvovirus genus (family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae) (Cotmore et al., 2019, 2014). Its genome consists of a 5200\u2010nucleotide (nt) DNA molecule containing two large open reading frames (ORFs) encoding for two non\u2010structural (NS1 and NS2) and two structural (VP1 and VP2) proteins through alternative splicing of the same mRNAs (Reed at al., 1988).",

To date, all three CPV variants are worldwide distributed, with different relative proportions according to the year and country of collection (Amrani et al., 2016; Miranda & Thompson, 2016; Woolford, Crocker, Bobrowski, Baker, & Hemmatzadeh, 2017).",

In Nigeria, only recently the molecular analyses based on the partial VP2 gene sequence of CPV strains described the circulating CPV variants (Apaa, Daly, & Tarlinton, 2016; Dogonyaro et al., 2013; Fagbohun & Omobowale, 2018). Unfortunately, all previous studies conducted in Africa lack a comprehensive sequence analysis including all the viral genome, thus preventing a more in\u2010depth knowledge on the origin and evolution of the circulating CPV strains. The aim of this study was to characterize the CPV strains recently collected in Nigeria, analysing the nearly complete CPV genome sequence and comparing the obtained sequences with worldwide related sequences available in GenBank.",

More recently, data about its spread were also obtained from Australia and Africa (Amrani et al., 2016; Castanheira et al., 2014; Chollom et al., 2013; Dogonyaro et al., 2013; Figuiredo et al., 2017; Folitse et al., 2017; Kapiya et al., 2019; Touhiri et al., 2009; Woolford et al., 2017). Most of these studies were based on the partial or complete VP2 gene sequence, due to the involvement of the VP2 capsid protein in host switch and to its fast evolutionary rate (Hueffer et al., 2003; Nelson, Palermo, Hafenstein, & Parrish, 2007; Shackelton, Parrish, Truyen, & Holmes, 2005), with limited information on other CPV encoding gene sequences.

These analyses conducted in Nigeria evidenced firstly the circulation of CPV\u20102a strains (Apaa et al., 2016; Dogonyaro et al., 2013) and only recently of CPV\u20102b/2c types (Fagbohun & Omobowale, 2018). In the present study, based on the analysis of 59 CPV\u2010positive samples, 5 CPV\u20102a and 54 CPV\u20102c strains have been found. These data showed a high prevalence of CPV\u20102c (91.5%) compared to the CPV\u20102a variant (8.5%), without any evidence of CPV\u20102b. Moreover, the divergence in the VP2 gene sequence of the CPV strains compared to those previously circulating in Nigeria suggests the potential circulation or introduction of different strains during years. Indeed, despite the limits of the length of available sequences, the CPV strains analysed in this study are prone to be related to a different origin than the previous ones. All CPV strains collected in 2010 (Dogonyaro et al., 2013) displayed divergent amino acids at specific VP2 residues (267, 324) with a closer phylogenetic connection with the CPV\u20102a strains previously collected in other continents such as North/South America and Europe. Differently, since 2014 the analysed circulating CPV strains showed a closer connection with CPV strains of Asian origin. Despite some previously analysed CPV sequences lack of informative VP2 aa residues (5, 267, 324, 370), the comparison with our sequences suggested that both CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102c strains collected in Nigeria after 2014 have a different phylogenetic origin with respect to previous analyses (Apaa et al., 2016; Fagbohun & Omobowale, 2018), suggesting a most recent introduction and spreading.",

Moreover, the VP2 aa change was due to a nt change in the second base of the codon (VP2 c14g), but this change was common only to CPV strains of Asian origin (Mira, Purpari, et al., 2019; Mira, Purpari, Lorusso, et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016; Zhuang et al., 2019).

These aa substitutions are located in the greatest variable VP2 GH loop, comprised between aa 267 and 498, but while residue 267 is not exposed on the capsid surface (Chiang, Wu, Chiou, Chang, & Lin, 2016) and may not affect the antigenicity of CPV (Xu et al., 2015), residues 324 and 370 could have immunological implications or biological relevance. Indeed, residue 324 is subject to positive selection (Hoelzer, Shackelton, Parrish, & Holmes, 2008) and is adjacent to residue 323, which affects binding to the canine transferrin receptor (Hueffer & Parrish, 2003). Residue 370 is close to residues associated with the ability of CPV to haemagglutinate, altering the pH dependence of haemagglutination or affecting the canine transferrin receptor (TfR) binding that determines the canine host range (Guo et al., 2013; Kaelber et al., 2012; Tsao et al., 1991).",

Although this change potentially accounts for the absence of VIC fluorescence in the 2a/2b and 2b/2c assays, specific additional studies are necessary to evaluate its real implication in the characterization of this CPV\u20102a mutant by the MGB probe assay, as previously done for the same substitution in the CPV\u20102c mutants (Decaro, Desario, Billi, et al., 2013).

Additional changes were also evident, some previously reported in South/North America and others never previously observed. This divergence may suggest the same ancestral origin with the CPV strains of Asian origin but a separate evolution, as well as a continuous adaptive process of the virus in separate environments. Indeed, some of these changes lay in the potential encoding sequence of functional domains (Mira, Canuti, et al., 2019) and, particularly, residues 351, 517 and 545 are located between the \u03b15\u2010 and \u03b16\u2010helices, between the \u03b25\u2010 and \u03b111\u2010helices and just close to the \u03b111\u2010helix of the helicase domain protein sequence, respectively, as illustrated in Niskanen, Ihalainen, Kalliolinna, H\u00e4kkinen, and Vihinen\u2010Ranta (2010).

This suggestion is supported by the evidence of genetic signatures typical of CPV or other canine viruses with different origins (Decaro, Campolo, et al., 2007; Martella et al., 2006; Mira, Purpari, Di Bella, et al., 2018; Mira, Purpari, Lorusso, et al., 2018), probably connected with the trading and transport of dogs between countries and continents.",
