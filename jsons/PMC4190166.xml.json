The clinician should consider the differential diagnoses and differentiate wheezing from rhonchi generated from the upper and large lower airways. Acute wheezing in the young child may be infectious (often with associated fever or upper respiratory symptoms) or may be related to foreign body aspiration (sometimes with abrupt onset, choking episode, unilateral wheezing, unequal breath sounds, or typical radiographic findings). Noninfectious etiologies of chronic or recurrent wheezing in the infant and toddler age groups may include structural abnormalities (which usually do not respond to bronchodilator therapy and may include cardiovascular disease, anomalies of the tracheobronchial tree, mediastinal masses) or functional causes (including aspiration syndromes, eg, gastroesophageal reflux, which may present with vomiting; hoarseness; symptoms while supine or after feedings; or \u201crecurrent croup\u201d). Other conditions that may present with recurrent wheeze include immune deficiency, cystic fibrosis, and other host-related diagnoses. In general, localized wheezing, recurrent pneumonia, feeding difficulties, and a lack of response to bronchodilator therapy suggest a nonviral etiology of wheezing.",

Further studies that differentiate treatment of first-time wheezing, recurrent wheezing, wheezing that requires hospital care, children with atopic predisposition, or other predisposing conditions are needed. A trial of bronchodilators is warranted to determine efficacy; however, in first-time wheezing induced by a virus, there may be little benefit.

The goal of long-term management of recurrent wheeze or asthma is to reduce symptoms, use of short-acting \u03b2-agonists, and risk for future severe exacerbations and hospitalizations.22 Management depends on wheezing phenotypes and prognostic factors. In general, the first-line controller therapy continues to be inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Often, this treatment is started as a therapeutic trial of patients with recurrent wheeze for whom the diagnosis is consistent with airflow obstruction and/or reversibility. Studies are ongoing regarding intermittent administration of high-dose ICS on onset of upper respiratory symptoms in young children with known recurrent wheeze or asthma. Results of 1 trial found improved outcomes of difficulty breathing and interference with activity of children at higher risk for asthma, and results of another study found that daily, low-dose budesonide did not have a greater impact on reducing asthma exacerbations when compared with intermittent high-dose budesonide.20, 23 Intermittent treatment may be considered for the child with primarily viral-associated wheezing. Children who have frequent symptoms not only associated with upper respiratory infections should be considered differently and may benefit from continuous therapy. In addition to considering the efficacy of ICS treatment, the adverse effects of high-dose ICS (eg, growth suppression) should be considered. Oral leukotriene antagonists also are commonly used in young children who wheeze. Initial daily therapy may reduce episode frequency in children with intermittent wheezing during viral infections, but this requires further investigation.21 The concept of stepping up short-term therapy is another option, which includes increasing rescue and controller medications at the onset of a viral infection or with exposure to a known trigger and then decreasing back to baseline after the exposure ceases or the infection resolves.24 The efficacy of this approach also warrants further study.",

The guidelines also stipulate that the use of preventive therapy only during seasons known to be problematic for a child is an acceptable option for some patients, as is a medication break during the summer when viral infections are less frequent. This may be most beneficial and appropriate for children with mild to mild-persistent symptoms. However, there is some concern, especially with young children who have experienced moderate-to-severe symptoms, for discontinuing controller therapy during the months just before the peak season for asthma hospitalizations.25 A vital component of therapy is asthma education for families, including instruction on proper device and spacer techniques, and a current action plan that describes appropriate medication indications and usage.",

Babies born prematurely, even without chronic lung disease, have an increased risk for recurrent wheezing during infancy and childhood.27, 28 Low lung function also is a risk factor for early childhood wheezing. It can persist beyond infancy in those children born prematurely and also is characteristic of infants who are small for gestational age (eg, babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy).26, 29, 30 A Th2 bias, delays in maturation of Th1 antiviral immunity, and altered innate and mucosal immunity are risk factors that are likely associated with the atopic phenotype and may become manifest through gene-environment interactions.31, 32, 33\n",

However, his exposure to an older sibling who was in day care may be protective. The patient's current episode of wheezing was most likely of viral etiology. A trial of a short-acting \u03b2-agonist would be warranted, in addition to fluid and oxygen supplementation if needed. In a first episode of wheezing, results of current studies indicate that oral steroids may not be beneficial; but, with our patient's atopic background and history of severe wheeze, a short steroid burst could be considered with follow-up to monitor the response. If he continues to have recurrent episodes of wheezing, then either daily or intermittent inhaled steroids could also be considered. He was not a candidate for RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab because he was not younger than 6 months of age at the onset of the RSV season. Because of his atopic dermatitis, a peripheral blood eosinophil count, evaluation by an allergist for aeroallergen skin prick testing, and possibly serum IgE measurement are indicated to assess the risk for asthma development as well as to decrease exposure to symptom triggers. Much remains to be understood about wheezing in the preschool-age child, biomarkers of future asthma development, and primary prevention of asthma. Growing knowledge, it is hoped, will soon lead to new preventive and therapeutic measures.",
