The physician called the laboratory for study randomization (FilmArray-RP or IFA) that was assigned by a computer generated allocation. Subjects were recruited Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 pm. From April to May 2016 the randomization ratio was 1:1. From July to November 2016, this ratio could not be maintained because of staffing constraints. Thus, samples received from 10 a.m. to 5 pm were processed by FilmArray-RP while samples received outside that period were processed by IFA. In 2017, randomization ratio returned to 1:1.",

This was probably due to the fact that patients were immediately started on antibiotics even before test results were available. In our study, we were able to demonstrate a change in medical management in relation to a reduction in antibiotic prescriptions in patients tested by FilmArray-RP. This change was observed not only in influenza- positive patients but also in those positive for other respiratory viruses. The greatest change was observed in patients with bronchitis and ILI, while the smallest decrease was observed in patients with presumptive pneumonia in whom a positive viral diagnosis could not rule out a potential co-existing bacterial infection. Brendish et al, also showed little change in antibiotic use in patients with pneumonia tested by FilmArray-RP. They demonstrated that the greatest impact on antibiotic decrease was in patients with asthma and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [17].",

Brendish et al. found a shorter mean LOS in patients tested by FilmArray-RP. Furthermore, patients with a positive FilmArray-RP had the shortest length of stay [17]. A one-day LOS reduction for adults with respiratory infection represents a minimum mean cost saving of approximately 530 $US/day which is consistent with our previous study on respiratory infections and associated costs performed in children [21].",
