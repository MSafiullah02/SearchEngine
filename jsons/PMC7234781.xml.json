A case series from Wuhan found that among patients admitted to hospital for infection with SARS-CoV-2, 36% had neurological features, mostly consisting of mild symptoms such as dizziness and headache, although these symptoms might be manifestations more of systemic illness than a specific neurological syndrome.23 Some patients had acute cerebrovascular disease or impaired consciousness as part of their illness.23 SARS-CoV-2 enters human host cells by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which has little expression in the brain.24, 25 There has been speculation that other routes of CNS infiltration might account for the respiratory failure caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, although there is currently no evidence.24 There is preliminary in-vitro evidence that\u2014possibly unlike SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)\u2014SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in neuronal cells, but the translation of this finding to in-vivo settings remains unclear.26 Even if severe neuropsychiatric consequences are proportionately rare, a considerable number of individuals worldwide would be affected.27, 28 Previous influenza pandemics have been associated with long-lasting neuropsychiatric consequences,29 so it is possible that other viral infections on a large scale could cause sustained mental morbidity.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected a large proportion of the world's population, but relatively little is known about its potential direct effects on mental health. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases were searched from inception to March 18, 2020, for terms relating to coronavirus infection and psychiatric presentations. medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv were searched for relevant preprints published between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020. Studies were included if they provided numerical or formal qualitative data on psychiatric presentations of coronavirus outbreaks. The majority of studies were of low or moderate quality.\nAdded value of this study\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that among patients admitted to hospital for severe SARS or MERS coronavirus infections, delirium is common acutely, whereas post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and fatigue are common in the following months. Preliminary data suggest patients with COVID-19 might experience delirium, confusion, agitation, and altered consciousness, as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nPrevious coronavirus epidemics were associated with a significant psychiatric burden in both the acute and post-illness stages. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is already evidence of delirium acutely and clinicians should be alert to the possibility of high rates of common mental disorders in the longer term. High-quality, peer-reviewed research into psychiatric symptoms of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as into potential mitigating factors and interventions is needed.\n",

We used a random-effects model because high heterogeneity was expected. The effect size measures were prevalence with 95% CIs (for number of signs or symptoms, quality of life scores, and employment) and mean difference with 95% CIs (for symptom severity and proportion of diagnoses). We defined point prevalences for number of psychiatric symptoms, proportion of diagnoses (defined by ICD-10, DSM-IV, or Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders [third edition] criteria or by validated psychometric scales with established cutoffs), and proportion of patients in employment as the proportion of cases over the sample size.30 For studies using cutoff scores on symptom rating scales, this percentage represents the presence of clinically significant symptoms reflected by the number of patients scoring above the defined cutoff. We also synthesised prevalences for individuals admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and undergoing mechanical ventilation for each coronavirus subtype for comparability. We used mean difference for symptom severity and quality-of-life outcomes, with negative values indexing lower symptom severity and higher quality of life, and positive values indexing higher symptom severity and lower quality of life, in patients with coronavirus infection than among healthy controls. Where continuous data (ie, symptom scores and quality of life) did not have a sufficient number of studies reporting suitable control group data to produce mean differences, we calculated sample size-weighted mean scores for all the studies reporting data alongside 95% CIs in addition to any potential meta-analytical summary effect. We calculated I\n2 as a measure of between-study heterogeneity. We did not assess funnel plot asymmetry because of an insufficient number of studies.31 Sensitivity analyses were done to assess the contribution of individual studies for the meta-analyses of diagnoses. Data were analysed using R (version 3.3.2) and the meta package (version 4.11) for prevalence data, and RevMan Web (version 5.3) for continuous outcomes. The threshold for significance was set to p values of less than 0\u00b705.",

They include six qualitative studies, two case reports, three case series, one cross-sectional study, one randomised controlled trial, and 12 cohort studies. Two studies43, 73 systematically assessed signs and symptoms in a representative cohort using a tailored Neuropsychiatric Symptom Checklist, the combined results of which are shown in table 2\n. During the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included depressed mood (42 [32\u00b76%; 95% CI 24\u00b77\u201340\u00b79] of 129 patients), anxiety (46 [35\u00b77%; 27\u00b76\u201344\u00b72] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34\u00b71%; 26\u00b72\u201342\u00b75] of 129), impaired concentration or attention (39 [38\u00b72%; 29\u00b70\u201347\u00b79] of 102; in one study), and insomnia (54 [41\u00b79%; 22\u00b75\u201350\u00b75] of 129). Notably, confusion was reported by 36 (27\u00b79%; 95% CI 20\u00b75\u201336\u00b70) of 129 patients despite mean ages in the included studies of 37\u00b76 years (SD 12\u00b74) and 41\u00b72 years (18\u00b76). In one study,33 13 (0\u00b77%) of 1744 patients with SARS in Hong Kong were diagnosed with steroid-induced psychotic disorders. In addition, two studies in which disorders were not systematically assessed reported cases of depression (two cases73), anxiety disorder (two cases73), acute stress reaction (two cases73), psychotic depression (one case33), psychotic disorder not specified (one case33), and deterioration of dementia (one case73). Five qualitative studies investigated the experiences of individuals infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.34, 35, 36, 37, 38 Loneliness, boredom, and frustration resulting from isolation were prominent.35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Individuals were often concerned about family members who were already infected, spreading the virus to other acquaintances, and death.34, 36, 37, 38 However, two studies noted the enormous gratitude felt by patients for the support they received.37, 38\n",

Some patients had neuropsychiatric investigations including brain MRI (13 [22%] of 58 patients), electroencephalogram (EEG; eight [14%] patients), and lumbar puncture (seven [12%] patients). MRI demonstrated larger leptomeningeal spaces in eight (62%) of 13 patients as well as two recent asymptomatic ischaemic strokes. EEG changes were non-specific, with diffuse bifrontal slowing consistent with encephalopathy described in one of eight patients. Of seven patients who had lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid analysis identified oligoclonal bands in two patients and elevated protein and IgG in another.

The scientific literature predominantly consists of data on patients with SARS and MERS treated in hospital, so there should be caution in generalising any findings to COVID-19, particularly for patients who have mild symptoms. Our main findings are that signs suggestive of delirium are common in the acute stage of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19; there is evidence of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and post-traumatic stress disorder in the post-illness stage of previous coronavirus epidemics, but there are few data yet on COVID-19.",

Diagnoses of mania and psychosis did occur in a small minority (0\u00b77%), but in a small sample this diagnosis appeared to be almost entirely related to use of exogenous corticosteroids, which are rarely prescribed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, insomnia, emotional lability, irritability, pressured speech, and euphoria were relatively common, suggesting that although a full syndrome of mania was uncommon, subthreshold symptoms might be present.",

Emotional lability, pressured speech, and euphoria were only reported by patients and relatives after a short follow-up (mean 42 days [range 26\u201386]) in one study43 in which corticosteroids had frequently been prescribed at high doses and symptoms; therefore, it might be of limited relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic. The point prevalences of anxiety disorders, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder were high, although the lack of adequate comparison groups or assessment of previous psychiatric disorder means that it is hard to separate the effects of the infection from the impact of an epidemic on the population as a whole or the possibility that selection bias led to the high prevalence figures. In terms of severity, mean scores for depression and anxiety on standard scales were below clinical cutoffs. Measures of health-related quality of life were considerably lower in patients with SARS than in control groups. However, the impairment in social functioning was greater than the effects on mental health (appendix p 11), suggesting that the effect of coronaviruses is broad and not specific to mental health. Some positive effects in terms of personal growth during adversity were noted.",

In the longer term, the data from SARS and MERS suggest that the prevalence of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and fatigue might be high, but as yet data on these diagnoses in patients with COVID-19 are preliminary or unpublished. In patients with severe illness requiring ICU admission, neurocognitive impairment might be a feature. We found only three cases of SARS-CoV-2-related psychiatric symptoms that were explicitly linked to hypoxic or encephalitic brain injury; this finding is consistent with the rarity of case reports that have associated detection of coronaviruses in the CNS with acute encephalitis or encephalomyelitis (mainly in immunocompromised or immunodeficient children).106, 107, 108\n",

The immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection is of interest and there might be a hyperinflammatory state similar to that seen in haemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis in which there are increased concentrations of C-reactive protein, ferritin, and interleukin-6, although this state is likely to be short lived.109 The link between inflammation and depression is well described and might explain some of the psychiatric morbidity.110\n",

A further limitation was that most studies were of low or moderate quality. Almost all of the studies we included in this review reported outcomes from patients admitted to hospital, which improves the comparability between coronavirus infections. However, although the frequencies of ICU admission and ventilation were similar for patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV infection (13% ICU admission and 7% ventilation) and SARS-CoV-2 (18% and 6%), they were considerably higher in patients with MERS (60% and 51%). Systematic assessment of psychiatric symptoms was rare, use of self-report questionnaires was common, and there was variation in the definition of illness and laboratory verification of infection between studies. The lack of baseline psychiatric assessments means that accurate estimates of incidence are impossible; therefore, we relied on point prevalence where possible. Few studies included objective biological measures, such as peripheral blood markers of genetic, inflammatory, immune, and metabolic function, cerebrospinal fluid measures, EEG, or brain imaging. Furthermore, few studies included comparison groups. The apparently high prevalence of common symptoms reported (such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue) could have been unrelated to the coronavirus infection and rather a consequence of selection bias. For the post-illness studies, there was substantial variation in follow-up time that hindered comparability. These factors might have contributed to heterogeneity, but there were too few studies to explore explanations of this variance.",
