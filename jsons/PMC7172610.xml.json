            "text": "Asthma exacerbations, the majority of which are caused by respiratory viral infection, are a continuing problem in respiratory medicine worldwide. Most viral exacerbations are due to either respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), coronaviruses, influenza viruses or human rhinoviruses (RV), with RV being the most frequent causative agent. In vitro and in vivo, RV infects the bronchial epithelium and upregulates a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, mucins and growth factors, all of which are thought to contribute to loss of lung function and lower airway inflammation [1], [2], [3], [4]. A large number of these mediators are upregulated solely, or in part, by the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. This would suggest that inhibiting the functions of this transcription factor may alleviate symptoms associated with RV-induced exacerbations of asthma. In virus-induced asthma, bronchial biopsies and sputum have neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrates [4], [5], and these cell types are therefore implicated in exacerbation pathogenesis. Due to the lack of a small animal model, there are many unclarified issues regarding the immunology of RV infection, and how this relates to exacerbations of asthma.",

            "text": "A recent study has estimated the economic impact of asthma in Germany to be in billions of Euros [6]. Although the actual costs of viral exacerbations are not known, it is arguable that they would contribute significantly to this cost, as viral infections account for about 80% of asthma exacerbations in children, and between 40% and 76% in adults [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. In the UK, one study has estimated the cost of asthma exacerbations to be approximately 3.5-fold higher per patient when compared to asthma patients that did not experience exacerbation [13]. Currently, the medical needs of patients suffering from viral exacerbations of asthma are largely unmet. There is no vaccine for RV or RSV, and the use of influenza vaccines in reducing virus-induced exacerbations remain controversial [14]. Steroids so far have been disappointing in their ability to control symptoms in models of experimental RV challenge of asthmatics [15], [16], [17], [18], and high-dose steroids remain only partially effective at controlling virus-induced exacerbations of asthma [19], [20]. A range of anti-viral, anti-RV compounds and combinations of the above have been used as therapies for RV infection, these have had variable efficacies in controlling RV-associated illnesses. This review will summarise the current understanding of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma, with a special focus on RV, including the epidemiology, host defence and immunology. Studies of treatments aimed at virus-induced exacerbations will also be discussed, with an emphasis on how better understanding the process of infection and upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediator gene expression may be useful in aiding the design of novel therapies for virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

            "text": "There is now overwhelming evidence that respiratory viruses are associated with acute exacerbations of asthma, accounting for up to 80\u201385% of acute exacerbations [7], [10], [21], [22]. Of the common respiratory viruses, RV have emerged as the most frequent. Other respiratory viruses such as RSV influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and the newly described metapneumoviruses, may also be associated with exacerbations of asthma. In children <2 years of age, RSV, infection is a common cause of significant morbidity in the form of wheeze or bronchiolitis [9], [10], [22], [23]. In older children and adults, RSV is still implicated in exacerbations of acute asthma, but does not appear to be as important as RV [7], [10], [21]. Influenza is an important pathogen during winter epidemics [24], but outside these periods it is not a major contributor to exacerbations of asthma. Recent data [25], [26], [27] suggest that human metapneumovirus has a minor contribution (<12%) to virus-induced exacerbations of asthma. The relative frequency of detection of each virus type in exacerbations of children >2 years and adults as found in previous studies [10], [21], [22] are summarised in Fig. 1\n, and represent approximate estimates for the most common respiratory viruses identified.",

Respiratory virus-induced exacerbations of asthma may occur in patients with phenotypes that differ from the atopic phenotype characteristic of allergen-induced asthma. One obvious difference between allergen-induced asthma and exacerbations is that inhaled corticosteroids, which are effective for the treatment of persistent asthma, do not work with the same efficacy in asthma exacerbations [19], [20]. Evidence for similar mechanisms of action is suggested by the fact that allergen exposure and virus infection may act in a synergistic or additive manner, increasing the risk of asthma exacerbations [28]. Pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide may also increase the risk of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma [29]. Some interesting differences between asthma exacerbations and persistent asthma are highlighted by the following observations.",

            "text": "Virus-induced asthma exacerbations may differ from persistent or allergen-induced asthma in that neutrophils appear to play a more prominent role in exacerbations, while eosinophils predominate in the latter. T lymphocytes appear important to both. The importance of neutrophils and CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in asthma exacerbations is supported by several studies [4], [5], [11], [15], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. In atopic asthmatics, eosinophils or eosinophil activation are also increased in virus-induced asthma. Given that a mixed aetiology is likely very common [28], [36], it is not surprising that there is much overlap in pathogenesis. Differences also exist in the way asthmatics respond to viral infection and may affect the outcome of infection and hence disease severity. Although asthmatics have the same incidence of viral infection as normals, they have increased severity and duration of lower airway symptoms and reduction in lung function than normals [37]. A recent study has also reported persistence of RV in children suffering from exacerbations of asthma, with children showing RV persistence having more severe exacerbations [38]. Also, increased levels of RV replication have also been observed accompanied by lower levels of virus-induced interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 expression and virus-induced apoptosis compared to normals [39]. In certain studies, greater levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine elaboration and inflammatory cell recruitment are observed [4]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthmatics when cultured with RV exhibiting lower levels of the TH1 cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12, suggesting that asthmatics may have a defective TH1 response to viral infection [40]. These data support two important points; firstly virus exacerbations of asthma have different properties to persistent or allergen-induced asthma, and secondly, researchers are still defining the characteristics of viral exacerbations and the populations in the community that are at risk. These important points must be appreciated prior to discussing new treatments for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma.",

Most RV are major group RV, and bind human ICAM-1, minor group RV bind the LDL receptor [43]. The difference in receptor specificity appears to be explained by a charge difference of the H1 loop of structural protein VP1 [44]. RV can replicate efficiently in the upper airway and can be detected in the lower airway although replication remains to be proven in vivo [45], [46]. RV infection can be readily observed in the bronchial epithelium [47] in vivo, and ex vivo, detected by sampling both the lower airway [48], [49] and upper airway [50], [51].",

Experimental and natural infections of human subjects have also shown that subjects infected with RV show an increased level of the above cytokines in nasal secretions and sputum [1], [2], [3], [4]. In one study, the accumulation of inflammatory cells and molecules correlated with increased symptom scores [2], and in another, decreased lung function of asthmatics [1], giving support to the current hypothesis that the local inflammatory reaction contributes to exacerbations in asthmatics. Therefore, if the upregulation of inflammatory molecules and cells can be prevented, diseases may be prevented. Inhibition of RV-induced inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production therefore represents an important therapeutic target for asthma. Some inflammatory molecules induced by respiratory virus infection and the cells they attract are outlined in Fig. 2\n.",

The NF-\u03baB or Rel family of transcription factors (p65, p50, c-Rel) are implicated in the expression of over 100 pro-inflammatory genes (for a review see [87], [88], [89]). NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its specific inhibitor I\u03baB, when phosphorylated by upstream kinases, I\u03baB is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus. The upstream kinases responsible for relaying the signal include NF-\u03baB inducing kinase (NIK) [90] and the I\u03baB kinases (IKK)-\u03b1\u29f8\u03b2\n[91], [92], and the more recently identified IKK-\u03b9/\u03b5\n[93], [94] and TANK binding kinase-1 (TBK-1) [95], [96], [97]. Once in the nucleus, NF-\u03baB can bind to various cis-acting sites within the promoter of NF-\u03baB responsive genes and promote transcription (depicted in Fig. 3\n).",

We have also extended this analysis for CXCL8 and IL-6 and have shown that NF-\u03baB cis-acting sequences are absolutely required for RV-induced promoter activation for these genes in bronchial epithelial cells, and have identified a role for IKK-\u03b2, using the specific IKK-\u03b2 inhibitor AS602868 (Serono, M.R. Edwards and S.L. Johnston, submitted). The role of NF-\u03baB signalling in RV-induced CCL5 and IL-11 gene expression is not yet known, however seems likely to be implicated as both promoters contain NF-\u03baB sequences, and these are important for gene expression following infection with other respiratory viruses [98], [99]. The role of NF-\u03baB in RV-induced CCL10 and CXCL5 has not yet been studied; however, both genes also have NF-\u03baB sites within their promoter, that are required for gene expression in various systems [100], [101], [102]. Hence inhibition of NF-\u03baB translocation, and NF-\u03baB signalling represents a potential area of therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "One unresolved question in RV biology is how NF-\u03baB signalling is initiated by virus infection. The dsRNA binding anti-viral protein kinase (PKR) has been widely implicated in NF-\u03baB signalling via interacting with IKK-\u03b1/\u03b2, or by phosphorylating I\u03baB directly [103], [104], [105], [106]. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) [107], and the recently described retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG)-I [108] also activate NF-\u03baB in response to viral infection or dsRNA. Gern et al. [68] have demonstrated a role for PKR in RV-induced pro-inflammatory mediators from bronchial epithelial cells. PKR would thus seem a potential therapeutic target in RV exacerbations of asthma; however, PKR is also implicated in beneficial anti-viral host responses. Through its ability to phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor-2\u03b1, PKR causes termination of host protein synthesis following viral infection [109], in an attempt to limit viral replication. PKR is also involved in type I IFN responses [110]. Hence, the possibility of beneficial and/or detrimental affects of PKR inhibition in RV exacerbations of asthma remains an open issue.",

Furthermore, RV 3C protease is required for generation of the RNA polymerase and hence viral RNA replication. RV 3C protease has also been implicated in initiation of host cell signalling leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine production [65]. Ruprintrivir was designed using solved X-ray crystal structures of the RV 3C protease, and was designed to bind irreversibly to the RV 3C active site [118]. Ruprintrivir demonstrated a broad anti-picornaviral spectrum in vitro, with an MIC of 0.023 \u03bcM [119]. The above study utilised Ruprintrivir as either two or five times a day as prophylaxis, 6 h prior to infection, or as a treatment five times a day 24 h after infection. As a prophylaxis, Ruprintrivir reduced mean total symptom score, viral titre, nasal secretions but not the incidence or frequency of clinical colds (as assessed by the number of infected subjects that developed clinical colds). As a therapeutic treatment, Ruprintrivir also reduced symptom scores, nasal secretions and viral titre. Ruprintrivir was generally well tolerated, despite this study requiring numerous deliveries via nasal spray.",

            "text": "The above studies provide evidence that treatment of clinical colds with anti-rhinoviral therapies is useful. However, there are potential problems with these approaches, with respect to potential therapies for virus-induced asthma exacerbations. For example, therapy of capsid binding molecules has led to the development of escape mutants [117]. It could also be argued for the RV 3C protease inhibitors, that virus binding, uncoating and entry could be a stimulus for cell signalling events, leading to initiation of pro-inflammatory mediator gene expression [61], and future therapies should aim at preventing the early steps of virus uncoating and entry. In support of this view, a study of Ruprintrivir to prevent RV14-induced IL-6 and CXCL8 suggested that this agent was not 100% effective at reducing mediator production, despite a high dose of 10 \u03bcM being used [120]. For therapies such as Ruprintrivir, which were administered via nasal spray, it can also be argued that delivery by this method may not be effective at treating the lower airway, where virus-induced asthma exacerbations are believed to be triggered. Furthermore, dosing regimes must also be suitable for children, as well as adults, in a setting of asthma exacerbations. Perhaps a further criticism of many of these studies is that duration of clinical colds was not affected by most treatments. Pleconaril was the only treatment successful at reducing duration of clinical cold. These therapies, although reducing symptoms may not necessarily affect duration of symptoms, and therefore may not improve the rate of general practitioner consultations, hospital admission rates, and school and work absenteeism for infected individuals with virus-induced exacerbations of asthma.",

Previous studies had suggested that effectiveness of IFN-\u03b12 was dose dependent, with high doses (2\u20134.5\u00d7107\n IU per day) effective at reducing both RV infection and illness, and lower doses, 106\n IU, effective at reducing illness (symptom scores), but not necessarily affecting the incidence of colds [129], [130], [131]. Despite the effectiveness of IFN-\u03b12 in models of experimental RV infection at these high doses, significant side effects were observed, including blood-tinged mucus, and even mucosal histopathological abnormalities [131]. This study sought to examine the efficacy of 106\n IU IFN-\u03b12 delivered three times daily for 5 days via nasal spray or drops. Challenge with RV39 occurred 28 h later. IFN-\u03b12 reduced virus shedding, with the drops having a more potent effect.

The tolerance study demonstrated numerous side effects particularly with the high-dose regime, including blood-tinged mucus, and an increase in subepithelial lymphocytic infiltrates in nasal biopsies. The efficacy study also reported significant decreases in nasal mucus weights, less development or incidence of clinical colds, but not less viral shedding, and these differences were only significant with the high-dose regime.",

An advantage that type I IFN therapy has over anti-RV therapies is that all exacerbations of asthma with viral agents could be controlled. Specific RV therapies would treat 60\u201365% of virus-induced exacerbations; however, broad-spectrum therapies such as IFN would not have this disadvantage. In particular, the above studies suggest that IFN-\u03b12 is effective when given prior to experimental RV infection, or as a prophylactic therapy in a context of natural RV infections. IFN-\u03b2 has been less impressive, exhibiting some effect when given prior to experimental RV challenge, but no effect as a prophylactic in natural infections. It is believed that these differences are not due to differences in anti-viral activity, as both IFN-\u03b12 and IFN-\u03b2 have similar anti-rhinoviral activities in vitro [137]. The relative ineffectiveness of IFN-\u03b2 has been thought to be due to instability as a nasal spray [136], [137]; however, when used as drops, IFN-\u03b2 also did not perform in a prophylactic study against natural RV infection [136].",

However, most studies reported side effects, even at lower doses of 106\n IU given daily. It can be argued that such side effects would be even more problematic in asthmatics, particularly the increased inflammation of the nasal passage, which appeared to be a hallmark of intranasal IFN therapy. Another issue for asthmatics would be effective delivery to the upper versus lower airway. While RV when administered by nasal spray can definitely be found in the lower airway during experimental infection, it is currently unknown whether intranasally applied IFN would act at a high enough concentration in the lower airway. An alternative could be IFN delivered via oral inhalation, similar to inhaled corticosteroids, thereby ensuring delivery to the lower airway. The ultimate effectiveness of IFN therapy in RV-induced exacerbations of asthma has yet to be investigated.",

Treatment ceased 5 days post-challenge. Up to 48 h, this treatment appeared affective at reducing nasal obstruction, nasal mucus weights, and nasal kinin concentrations; however, this effect was lost when steroid treatment ceased. Another study also examined prednisone (20 mg) given three times daily for 5 days, with treatment commencing 11 h prior to RV infection [141]. The steroids reduced nasal kinin and mucus concentrations but had little effect on other symptoms. Virus load was higher in the steroid-treated group, with significant differences on days 3 and 4 post-infection. The data suggest that an adverse effect of steroids may be suppression of anti-viral mediators that are required for the natural defence against viral infection in vivo.

Budesonide improved lung function in the asthmatics, and decreased eosinophil numbers, but did not reduce total inflammatory cell numbers in the lung.

In another study, it was observed that budesonide treatment caused a small but significant increase in the soluble IL-1R antagonist in nasal secretions. There was no significant difference between CXCL8 and IL-1\u03b2 levels between asthmatics treated with budesonide and control asthmatics treated with placebo [16].

Several other studies report similar findings [143], [144], [145]. In contrast, a study investigating emergency room hospital admissions and community cases of viral infection in autumn in Canada revealed that in children, patients admitted to hospital with exacerbations are less likely to have been given prior treatment in the form of inhaled GCs or leukotriene receptor antagonists [55]. Also, two clinical studies consisting of older children (>13 years) and adults have shown that GCs alone have failed to reduce asthma exacerbation rates. In these studies, increasing the GC dose did not reduce the rate of asthma exacerbations [19], [20], Currently, there is much evidence suggesting that the use of GCs alone is only partially protective against virus-induced exacerbations of asthma, and that preventive therapy can be improved.

Studies completed thus far suggest a positive effect of \u03b2\n2 agonists when combined with GCs, in reducing frequencies of asthma exacerbations [162], [163]; however, further evidence is required before the use of GCs in this way is generally accepted. These studies may also be of mixed aetiology, as exacerbations in general were investigated, and not specifically virus-induced exacerbations.

Clearly, the potential role of NF-\u03baB in the expression of mediators that are beneficial to the host response to infection needs to be carefully considered before NF-\u03baB intervention becomes a serious therapeutic option. With the discovery of alternate NF-\u03baB signalling intermediates such as IKK-\u03b9/\u03b5 and TBK-1, the proposition of NF-\u03baB inhibition has become more complex (see Fig. 3). However, the role of individual NF-\u03baB signalling intermediates in both harmful pro-inflammatory mediator gene expression as well as in useful anti-viral mediator gene expression, is a much understudied field, and whether distinct signalling intermediates exist for IFN expression versus pro-inflammatory cytokine expression is currently unclear. Further research efforts are required before the role of this important transcription factor and its signalling pathways can be fully understood.",

            "text": "Many respiratory viruses, in particular RV, cause exacerbations of asthma, and this is a healthcare concern worldwide. RVs upregulate pro-inflammatory mediators and cause local inflammation in the lower airway, and this may precipitate exacerbations of asthma in certain individuals. Individuals suffering from viral exacerbations of asthma are yet to be treated effectively, and there is wide interest in a range of treatment options for these unmet medical needs. Specific anti-rhinoviral therapy, IFN therapy, and steroid-based therapies have all been studied in the past with mixed successes. Anti-viral therapies have been classically applied in the context of clinical colds (Table 1\n); however, they have not yet been studied in exacerbations of asthma. With the link between RV and asthma exacerbations now more established, the anti-rhinoviral treatments Pleconaril and Tremacamra should be regarded as serious therapeutic options. The study of type I IFN therapy in clinical colds has highlighted many problems with this treatment. Dose, delivery and safety all remain important issues for viral exacerbations of asthma. As a deficiency in IFN-\u03b2 expression has been recently described in asthmatics [39], type I IFN therapy remains a candidate treatment however. One potential area of further research is combined anti-viral, anti-inflammatory therapy, which may inhibit viral replication as well as treating upper and lower airway inflammation. Another area that has yet to be tested formally is NF-\u03baB inhibition, as many RV-induced inflammatory mediators are NF-\u03baB dependent. The wealth of literature so far reported on RV-induced exacerbations of asthma suggests that the relationship of infection and asthma exacerbation, in particular the cellular and molecular immunological aspects of pathogenesis, is still unclear, and further experimental infection studies are required to better understand these important processes. In particular, how asthmatics may differ from normal individuals who do not suffer from lower airway disease is a priority. There is also a need for further vigorous pursuit of the molecular mechanisms of infection and pro-inflammatory mediator induction, for example, the development of small animal models that will be invaluable for testing these ideas and providing future therapeutic targets.",

Following viral infection, or dsRNA recognistion via PKR and/or TLR3, RIG-I, or cytokines, e.g. TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (via NIK), IKK phosphorylates I\u03baB leading to its degradation by the proteasome.
