Methods and Results: Two virus strains from each of six animal virus families, including both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, were lyophilized in (i) culture medium, (ii) with the addition of gelatine-sucrose and (iii) skim milk-sodium glutamate. All the virus suspensions were frozen (i) at \u00c080\u00b0C or (ii) in liquid nitrogen before lyophilization. Virus titre assay after lyophilization and after 8 months storage at 4\u00b0C revealed that the efficacy of stabilizers depended on virus structure. Generally, the best protective quality for enveloped viruses was achieved with gelatine-sucrose, which best maintained their infectivity and envelope morphology. Even additive-free culture medium proved adequate for nonenveloped viruses. Differences in stabilizer efficacy were also found between virus families and were expressed immediately after lyophilization; the activity of stabilizers in the course of storage was very similar. Freezing in liquid nitrogen proved beneficial for picornaviruses. Conclusions: The choice of an appropriate stabilizer with respect to virus type is crucial for effective lyophilization. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study contributes to the establishment of general guidelines for animal virus lyophilization, with particular respect to differences in virus structure.",

Lyophilized viruses are not only stable and undemanding in long-term storage but are also transportable at ambient temperatures. Lyophilization is therefore widely employed in culture collections to maintain virus stocks and in the pharmaceutical industry to preserve live viruses. Despite the use of a wide range of drying technologies and many properly developed specific methodologies for particular strains (Sarkar et al. 2003; Kang et al. 2010) , more generalized guidelines for virus lyophilization, which allow for differences in virus structure and taxonomy, are still lacking.",

            "text": "Apart from vacuum and temperature conditions, the major factors affecting virus stability during lyophilization are chemical additives and prefreezing methods (Zhai et al. 2004) . Rapid freezing and the addition of certain cryoprotectants before lyophilization reduce the size of ice crystals formed (Buitink et al. 2000; Zhai et al. 2004; Hansen et al. 2005) , decreasing the level of damage to viral particles during the freezing process. Moreover, cryoprotectants such as carbohydrates and polypeptides form amorphous glass states that immobilize biomolecules and protect them during both the drying stage and storage. However, the protective effect does not appear to be directly correlated with the formation of such glass states (Carpenter et al. 2010) . The mechanisms that may be involved in the protection of viruses appear to be more complex. Some sugars are known to form hydrogen bonds to polar and charged groups as water is removed, thus preventing the damage to biomolecules that arises out of drying (Tanaka et al. 1991) . Sodium glutamate neutralizes the carbonyl groups in the medium that are harmful to virus protein in a lyophilized state (Ferris et al. 1990) . Furthermore, the different collapse temperatures (T g ) of the various additives may influence the structure of the cake created during lyophilization and thus affect the shelf life of the sample (Chang and Patro 2004) . The stability of structurally different viruses during lyophilization and subsequent storage is evidently dissimilar (Gould 1995; Hubalek 1996) . The suitability of particular stabilizers varies for each virus; the stabilizer itself induces or imposes specific stresses during the lyophilization process, notably chemical and osmotic stress and pH shift during crystallization (Peetermans 1996) .",

Culture medium without additives was employed as the first stabilizer. Next, two stabilizer formulations based on culture medium combined with additives (gelatine, sucrose, skim milk and sodium glutamate) were tested. These organic substances appear to make a positive contribution to the lyophilization of many viruses, both separately and in various combinations (Suzuki 1970; Scott and Woodside 1976; Ferris et al. 1990; Hubalek 1996; Liska et al. 2007; Kang et al. 2010) . To compare the differences of effect of stabilizers and freezing rates both between and within virus families, this study was carried out on six families, each represented by two selected strains: the adenoviruses (Bovine adenovirus, BAdV; Canine adenovirus 1, CAdV-1), caliciviruses (two strains of Feline calicivirus, FCV), coronaviruses (Bovine coronavirus, BCoV; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV), herpesviruses (Bovine herpesvirus, BoHV-1; Canid herpesvirus 1, CaHV-1), paramyxoviruses (Bovine parainfluenza virus 3, BPIV-3; Canine parainfluenza virus, CPIV) and picornaviruses (Porcine teschovirus, PTV; Bovine enterovirus, BEV). The selected virus families included three enveloped (coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses-ss RNA, herpesviruses-ds DNA) and three nonenveloped viruses (adenoviruses-ds DNA, caliciviruses and picornaviruses-ss RNA).",

In most families, freezing rate appeared to have no influence, with the exception of the picornaviruses and coronaviruses. Picornaviruses were more stable after lyophilization and maintained better stability, even after the storage period, when they had been frozen more rapidly in liquid nitrogen. In contrast, coronaviruses showed better stability when they were frozen at \u00c080\u00b0C, but only in the storage period.

Morphological changes in TGEV (coronavirus) were slight, with only moderately increased numbers of damaged particles observed in suspensions after lyophilization.

However, some contributions have already demonstrated that this has a good protective function during the process of lyophilization, particularly in the stabilization of Foot-and-mouth disease virus (Fellowes 1965; Ferris et al. 1990 ). As sucrose and calf serum are present in the culture medium, a stabilizing effect may occur even with no additives (Grose et al. 1981; Hubalek 1996) . Comparison of two freezing methods, at \u00c080\u00b0C and in liquid nitrogen, in this study showed they were equally effective when all viruses were tested as a single group. Zhai et al. (2004) also pointed out that faster freezing before lyophilization did not always guarantee a better titre recovery. However, freezing at \u00c080\u00b0C is known to be fast enough fully to maintain the infectivity of certain viruses (Hansen et al. 2005) . Nevertheless, considerable differences in the effects of stabilizers and freezing rates between structurally different viruses were detected.",

The present study shows that the action of various stabilizers and freezing rates clearly depends on virus structure. The presence (or absence) of a virus envelope and family classification had significant influences on titre reduction after lyophilization and storage. The amount of the titre reduction was similar in all enveloped viruses examined, but it varied widely within nonenveloped viruses. This would suggest that there is no general rule to encompass the sensitivity of a virus to lyophilization stress based on the presence or absence of an envelope alone. It has been recently shown that enveloped viruses are not generally more sensitive than nonenveloped ones (Tuladhar et al. 2012) . Despite this, certain distinct, group-specific patterns emerged in the present study: the enveloped viruses were significantly better stabilized with the gelatine-sucrose additive compared to other stabilizers, while there were no differences in the effects of the various stabilizers on the nonenveloped viruses. Hence, the efficiency of stabilizers used appears to have a relationship with the presence or absence of the viral envelope. This becomes even more noticeable when the viruses are considered at family level. The responses of viruses of the same family to additives and freezing rates during lyophilization and storage were similar in the present study. Nevertheless, other studies have shown that even closely related viruses can differ in their sensitivity to identical stress, due to certain molecular differences in the proteins that make up viral particles (Coleman et al. 1973; Chambon et al. 1994; Bozkurt et al. 2013) . The best stabilizing activity ascertained here was for gelatine in combination with sucrose as an additive for all enveloped viruses; the same stabilizer also performed no worse than the others in the nonenveloped adenoviruses and caliciviruses. Gelatine and sucrose (in different proportions and combinations) have also been successfully used for the stabilization of enveloped viruses in other studies (Grose et al. 1981; Tannock et al. 1987; Sarkar et al. 2003; Liska et al. 2007) , and thus, their combination appears to be generally suitable for this category Table 4 , summarizing morphological changes in viral envelopes after lyophilization.

            "text": "of viruses. However, gelatine with sucrose showed inferior protection activity for the nonenveloped picornaviruses here, although Kang et al. (2010) demonstrated stabilization of an attenuated Duck hepatitis virus (picornaviruses) vaccine using a lower concentration of gelatine (0\u00c15%) in combination with sorbitol. The skim milk with sodium glutamate mixture did not stabilize coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses (both enveloped viruses) properly. For nonenveloped viruses, the protective activity of skim milk with sodium glutamate was not obvious, except for a slightly favourable effect in the picornaviruses. However, Suzuki (1970) successfully used protective media consisting of sodium glutamate in the poxviruses, another nonenveloped family (not examined here). Fellowes (1965) and Ferris et al. (1990) demonstrated that culture medium without additives provided adequate stabilizing activity for Foot-and-mouth virus (picornaviruses), as above, something that was also confirmed here for all nonenveloped viruses tested and also for coronaviruses. That the lyophilization of picornaviruses is generally difficult, as described by Berge et al. (1971) among others, was also confirmed in this study. Despite their excellent resistance to chemical stresses (Dvorakova et al. 2008) , picornaviruses were inactivated more dramatically than other viruses in the tests, by 2-4\u00c12 lg during lyophilization only. This observation may be related to the better effects of more rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen, which was found for only this family. Thus, only the extensive inactivation of picornaviruses could reveal an advantage of a faster freezing. In the adenoviruses, a curious increase of titre recovery occurred after the storage period in comparison with titres assayed immediately after lyophilization. A similar experimental result was found in other virus groups by Tannock et al. (1987) and explained in terms of the disaggregation of clumped particles after reconstitution of lyophilized material. This is a very probable explanation here as well, as adenoviruses form aggregates very readily (Galdiero 1979; Walkiewicz et al. 2009 ). Uncoating of herpesviruses and consequent loss of infectivity during lyophilization without high concentration of protectants, especially sugars, has already been described by Grose et al. (1981) , Hansen et al. (2005) and Zhai et al. (2004) . In the present study, in the medium without additives, obvious uncoating with corresponding titre loss due to lyophilization was observed in herpesviruses (BoHV-1) and paramyxoviruses (BPIV-3). The morphology of viruses lyophilized with additives deteriorated less; the damage was at its least for gelatine with sucrose as a stabilizer. In the coronaviruses (TGEV), no clear differences in virus envelope morphology emerged, although the titre recovery was significantly worse for the stabilizer with skim milk and sodium glutamate, whereas the medium without additives was as effective as the combination of gelatine and sucrose. This may be explained by the denaturing of certain envelope proteins without visible disruption of the membrane (Hansen et al. 2005) and a simultaneous loss of infectivity. The natural disordered appearance of coronavirus nucleoprotein, quite dissimilar from all the other viruses studied here (herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses), renders it possible to distinguish virus particles by TEM once they have completely lost their envelopes. This may well have distorted the counts of intact and defective particles in TGEV.",

            "text": "A collapsed cake structure was observed both macroscopically and microscopically in all viruses lyophilized in the culture medium without additives. Their cake microstructure lacked pores, a condition considered to lead to the degradation of the sample and adverse effects on its protective storage quality. This loss arises out of high and unevenly distributed residual moisture and weak reconstitution of lyophilized material, among other things (Chang and Patro, 2004; Puapermpoonsiri et al. 2010) . However, the storage stability of the lyophilized viruses was the same for all the stabilizers tested, including the collapsed culture medium without additives. A single exception was detected in the paramyxoviruses, in which inferior stabilizing activity occurred in the noncollapsed skim milk with sodium glutamate. Hence, cake collapse appeared to have no impact on the stability of the viruses during storage. Despite a noticeably different micromorphology of cake arising out of different freezing rates, with approximately five times larger ice crystals in samples frozen at \u00c080\u00b0C in comparison with crystals of samples frozen in the liquid nitrogen, both freezing rates had similar impact on virus stability during lyophilization (except in the picornaviruses). However, the rate of freezing affects ice crystal size and morphology, which in turn impact on sublimation during lyophilization and resulting residual moisture content of the lyophilized product (Dawson and Hockley 1992) . Although residual moisture can have a strong influence on the storage stability of a virus (Worrall et al. 2000) , in this study, differences in storage stability between viruses frozen less and more rapidly were minor (significant only in coronaviruses).",

            "text": "In conclusion, the most important option for effective lyophilization of viruses is the choice of an appropriate stabilizer, which should be selected with respect to the type of virus. The efficacy of a given stabilizer is markedly dependent on the virus family, and its suitability can be, to a large degree, generalized within the groups of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. In enveloped viruses, a culture medium with added gelatine and sucrose provides the best protective activity for virus infectivity (among the stabilizers tested here). Gelatine and sucrose also best maintain virus envelope morphology in the herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses. Nonenveloped viruses are less stabilizer specific, and even the culture medium without additives had an adequate protective effect in all the nonenveloped families tested. The freezing rate had only a minor impact on virus stability during lyophilization, both for freezing at \u00c080\u00b0C and in liquid nitrogen. Faster freezing is beneficial only for picornaviruses, which are generally considered the most labile viruses under lyophilization stress. The decisive impact on the efficiency of the stabilizer and freezing rate is expressed immediately after lyophilization. During the storage period, the infectivity of nearly every virus decreased similarly for all stabilizers and freezing rates in this study.",
