However, the incidence of lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTIs) could be considerable, as well. In developed countries, a LRTI occurs in 20\u201339% of infants and children under 3 years of age (1, 2, 3). Moreover, LRTIs not only constitute a burden on health care costs (4), but are also a possible risk factor for developing asthma and allergy during early childhood (5) and may lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in late adulthood (6).",

A new LRTI was recorded if the infant was symptom free for at least 14 days between two episodes.

However, unlike other authors (25), we found no significant differences between infants with LRTIs and NO\u2010LRTIs with respect to the frequency of day care attendance. This may be due to the low attendance at day care before the first year of age in our population (nearly 20% vs. more than 50% in the above\u2010mentioned study).",

These results could be explained if families with low SES were less likely to call us and therefore would have diminished the frequency due to misclassification. However, the surveillance project designed a monthly call to reduce this effect. Studies describing the inverse relationship between SES and LRTIs provide limited information because only differences in mortality or hospitalization rates were examined (28). Recently, it has been suggested that the relationship between SES and physical health may not be constant across ages. In a cross\u2010sectional interview about acute respiratory conditions in infants and children aged 0\u201318, a reverse SES gradient was found in early years (low SES \u2013 low frequency of respiratory illnesses), whereas an expected SES gradient appeared during adolescence (low SES \u2013 high frequency of respiratory illnesses) (29).",
