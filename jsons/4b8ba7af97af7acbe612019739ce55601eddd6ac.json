The majority of states have followed with similar 19 guidelines [1] . Although definitions of \"elective\" or \"non-essential\" surgery vary across pandemic. However, this mandated reduction of non-essential surgical procedures will have a 27 profound impact on the healthcare system [2]. Furthermore, given that hip and knee arthroplasty 28 compromise a substantial share of the surgical volume in the United States (US), there is no 29 doubt these policies are hard felt by hip and knee arthroplasty patients and the providers and 30 institutions that care for them. The purpose of this study was to estimate 1) the number of 31 primary hip and knee arthroplasty procedures canceled due to COVID-19 and 2) the number of 32 revision hip and knee arthroplasty procedure canceled due to COVID-19 in order to better 33 understand the effect of COVID-19 on hip and knee arthroplasty surgical volume in the US.

Four studies that projected hip and knee arthroplasty 39 procedures volumes in the US for 2020 were assessed [3-6]. These studies utilized various 40 projection modeling algorithms and time periods of data to create hip and knee arthroplasty 41 volume projections. Overall, the projected number of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 42 procedures to be performed in 2020 ranged from approximately 775,000 to 1.4 million, and the 43 projected number of primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures to be performed in 2020 44 ranged from approximately 460,000 to 512,000 depending upon the specific model utilized [3-6]. 45 Only one study provided projections for revision hip and knee arthroplasty procedures during 46 2020, with Kurtz et al. [6] projecting approximately 128,000 revision TKA procedures and 66,000 revision THA procedures to be performed in 2020. To best estimate the projected primary 48 THA and TKA volume for 2020, the volume projections across these four studies were averaged 49 for the various procedures, including their multiple projection models.

To estimate the number of these presumed essential hip and knee arthroplasty procedures 60 for 2020, data from the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) was assessed[7].61 According to the AJRR 2019 Annual Report, THA for fracture accounted for 2.7% of all primary 62 THA procedures occurring from 2012 to 2018 [7]. Over this same time period THA revisions 63 were performed for infection in 13.3% of cases, periprosthetic fracture in 5.4% of cases and 64 fracture or fracture related sequalae in 4.3% of cases [7]. Similarly, from 2012 to 2018, TKA revisions were performed for infection in 20.5% of cases and fracture or fracture related sequelae 66 2.3% of cases [7]. These percentages were utilized to exclude \"essential\" cases from the 2020 67 volume projections to estimate the number of \"non-essential\" hip and knee arthroplasty 68 procedures that were projected to occur throughout 2020. 69 Utilizing the estimated non-essential 2020 volume projections, monthly and weekly 70 estimates of non-essential hip and knee arthroplasty procedures that would have occurred had 71 there not been any restrictions due to COVID-19 were calculated. These estimates were made by 72 dividing the 2020 projections equally into the respective time periods. This strategy was felt to 73 be valid after reviewing AJRR data to calculate the number of primary and revision hip 74 arthroplasty procedures performed per month over the years 2018 and 2019. This analysis 75 revealed the monthly procedural volumes varied slightly month-to-month with a range of 6.2% 76 to 9.9% of total procedures occurring per month in 2018 (median: 8.8%) and a range of 5.5% to 77 10.3% of total procedures occurring per month in 2019 (median: 9.1%). In 2018, 8.9% of all hip 78 and knee arthroplasty procedures occurred in April and 9.2% occurred in May. In 2019, 10.0% 79 of all hip and knee arthroplasty procedures occurred in April and 10.3% occurred in May.",

First, the estimates were based upon projected 148 2020 hip and knee arthroplasty volume from other studies and are thus limited by the accuracy of 149 those projections. However, we sought to minimize these limitations by averaging the 2020 150 primary hip and knee arthroplasty volume projections from four recently published datasets [3-151 6]. Furthermore, it is likely that recommendations to cancel non-essential surgery were 152 implemented over different time periods. However, given the timing of state and national 153 recommendations [1] and the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that the 154 majority of medical centers in the US will perform minimal primary hip and knee arthroplasty 155 and very few essential revision procedures during the months of April and May of 2020 and thus 156 we have provided both weekly and monthly projections to account for this and to provide as 157 accurate projections as possible. Lastly, the true number of canceled hip and knee arthroplasty 158 procedures will also greatly depend upon how long the COVID-19 pandemic lasts and when 159 restrictions on non-essential surgical cases can be lifted. These will happen at various times 160 across the country, as each city and state go through their own phase of the pandemic. 161 The results of a survey given to AAHKS members regarding the impact of COVID-19 on 162 their practice of hip and knee arthroplasty surgery was recently released [9]. The survey results 163 indicated that 92% of hospitals have stopped elective inpatient surgery due to COVID-19 and 164 74% of responding surgeons are effectively not working due to institutional or self-imposed 165 deferral of elective surgery [9]. These survey results suggest that our estimates from the 100% 166 and 75% cancellation scenarios may be the most accurate projections for the number of cases 167 canceled per week due to COVID-19. Furthermore, the AAHKS survey results indicated that 168 essential surgery is still occurring throughout the US, with 64% of those who responded 169 indicating they are still performing surgery for periprosthetic joint infection and 88% performing surgery for periprosthetic fracture [9]. These results also support our assumptions that infection 171 and fracture related revisions would continue to occur as essential surgical procedures. 172 The results of this study highlight the profound impact COVID-19 is having on our 173 current hip and knee arthroplasty volume. The large number of estimated cases canceled due to 174 COVID-19 translates into major financial losses for our healthcare institutions and may have 175 profound effects on our patients who had to have their surgery postponed. Even when utilizing a 176 relatively conservative cancellation scenario, estimates still translate close to 100,000 hip and 177",
