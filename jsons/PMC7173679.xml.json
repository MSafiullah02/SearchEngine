Recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that HFNC reduces the need for intubation compared with conventional oxygen with no change of the death risk or ICU length of stay [2, 3], while no direct evidence supports the use of NIV due to a high failure rate [4]. However, when resources become limited with no option of invasive ventilation, the use of NIV may be justified. The major caveat of using noninvasive respiratory support in the face of the COVID19 pandemic is the generation of aerosols composed of small virus containing particles which may remain suspended in the air, with increased risk of health care workers (HCW) [7, 8]. The risk of aerosolization depends on many variables, including duration of use, flow velocity, mask leakage and patient coughing and cooperation.",
