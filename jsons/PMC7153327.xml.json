            "text": "Genetic change was a prerequisite for the early life forms to be generated and maintained (Chapter 1), and it is also a requirement for the evolution of present-day life. We may willingly or inadvertently modify selective pressures, but genetic change is rooted in all replication machineries. The results of genetic modifications, regarding relative dominances of variant forms, are guided by selective pressures and random events. The replicative machinery itself has probably been influenced by natural selection; as an example, polymerases devoid of a capacity to generate variants should have endured a long-term selective disadvantage. However, once the replicative machinery was established, the mechanisms of variation acted independently of the selective pressures applied or to come.\n",

            "text": "Viruses use the same molecular mechanisms of genetic variation than other forms of life: mutation (that encompasses point mutations and insertions-deletions of different lengths), hypermutation, several types of recombination, and genome segment reassortment. Mutation is observed in all viruses, with no known exceptions. Recombination is also widespread, but its role in the generation of diversity appears to vary among viruses. Its occurrence was soon accepted for DNA viruses, but it was considered uncertain for the RNA viruses. Pioneering studies of poliovirus (PV) by P. D. Cooper, V. I. Agol and colleagues, and of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) by A.M. King and colleagues provided the first evidence of recombination in RNA. The present perception is that recombination is more widespread than thought only a few decades ago and that its frequency and the types of genomic forms it generates are varied among viruses. For example, it appears that positive-strand RNA viruses recombine more easily than negative-strand RNA viruses to give rise to mosaic genomes of standard length. Several negative-strand RNA viruses, however, can yield defective genomes through recombination, frequently characterized by deletions in their RNA. A connection between the structure of replication complexes\u2014as viewed by X-ray diffraction or high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy\u2014and the propensity to produce defective genomes has not been established. Defective genomes are increasingly perceived not only as unavoidable side-products of blind replicative imperfections but as classes of genome subpopulations that perform relevant biological roles for the standard, infectious viruses. Genome segment reassortment, a type of variation close to chromosomal exchanges in sexual reproduction, is an adaptive asset of segmented viral genomes, as continuously evidenced by the ongoing evolution of the influenza viruses. The three modes of virus genome variation are not incompatible, and reassortant-recombinant-mutant genomes are continuously arising in present-day viruses. The potential for genetic variation of RNA and DNA viral genomes is remarkable, and it is the ultimate molecular mechanism that lies at the origin of the virus diversity delineated in Chapter 1.",

In the case of viral genomes, mutations can result from different mechanisms: (i) template miscopying (direct incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide); (ii) primer-template misalignments that include miscoding followed by realignment, and misalignment of the template relative to the growing chain (polymerase \u201cslippage\u201d or \u201cstuttering\u201d); (iii) activity of cellular enzymes (i.e., deaminases), or (iv) chemical damage to the viral nucleic acids (deamination, depurination, depyrimidination, reactions with oxygen radicals, direct and indirect effects of ionizing radiation, photochemical reactions, etc.) (Naegeli, 1997, Bloomfield et al., 2000, Friedberg et al., 2006).",

Each base includes potential hydrogen-bonding donor sites (amino or amino protons) and hydrogen-bonding acceptor sites (carbonyl oxygens or aromatic nitrogens) that contribute to standard Watson-Crick base pairs (Fig. 2.1\n), as well as wobble base pairs (nonstandard Watson-Crick, but fundamental for RNA secondary structure and mRNA translation) (Fig. 2.2\n). The conformation of the purine and pyrimidine bases is highly dynamic. Amino and methyl groups rotate about the bonds that link them to the ring structure. In dilute solution, hydrogen bonds are established with water, and they can be displaced by nucleotide or amino acid residues to give rise to nucleotide-nucleotide or nucleotide-amino acid interactions. The strength difference between hydrogen bonds established in a polynucleotide chain with water, and their strength between two bases in separate polynucleotide chains determines whether a double-stranded polynucleotide will be formed.",

As a consequence, in addition to the standard Watson-Crick and wobble, other base pairs are found in naturally occurring nucleic acids (notably cellular rRNA and tRNA) and in synthetic oligonucleotides (A-U or A-T Hoogsteen, and A-G, C-U, G-G, and U-U pairs, as well as interactions involving ionized bases). One of the types of electronic redistribution leads to tautomeric changes, such as the keto-enol and amino-imino transitions, which modify the hydrogen-bonding properties of the base; tautomeric imino and enol forms of the standard bases can produce non-Watson-Crick pairs. The proportion of the alternative tautomeric forms can be influenced by modifications in the purine and pyrimidine rings, which, in turn, can favor either the syn or anti conformation of a nucleoside, which is defined by the torsion angle of the bond between the 1\u2032 carbon of the ribose and either N1 in pyrimidines or N9 in purines (Fig. 2.1). The anti-conformation is usually the most stable in standard nucleotides and polynucleotides. The transition from the anti to the syn conformation may alter the hydrogen-bonding properties of the base, thereby inducing mutagenesis (Bloomfield et al., 2000, Suzuki et al., 2006). The understanding of conformational effects on the base-pairing tendencies of nucleoside analogs in the context of the active site of a polymerase is very relevant to the design of specific mutagenic analogs for viral polymerases in lethal mutagenesis-centered antiviral approaches (Chapter 9).",

In the case of RNA, double-stranded regions in the adequate alternation with single-stranded regions, determine key catalytic or macromolecule-attracting abilities, as for example, ribozyme activities (Chapter 1), the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of several viral and cellular mRNAs, or multitudes of functional RNA-protein interactions (Denny and Greenleaf, 2018).",

Structural transitions due to alternative stacking conformations, particularly within polypurine or polypyrimidine tracts, can affect nucleic acid-protein interactions. In turn, replication machineries (typically including viral and host proteins gathered in membrane structures) may also be affected by nucleic acid conformations; such effects are important in virology regarding consequences for mutant generation in a given template sequence context. These considerations on structural transitions are relevant to the nonneutral character of silent (also termed synonymous) mutations (those in open-reading frames that do not result in an amino acid substitution), a point to be addressed in the next section. Transitions from a single-stranded into a double-stranded nucleic acid structure and the relative stability of the two forms depend on multiple factors that include the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid, its being a ribo- or a deoxyribose-polynucleotide, temperature, ionic environment, and ionic strength. Positively charged counter-ions neutralize negatively charged phosphates, and favor duplex stability [as an overview of physical and chemical properties of nucleic acids and their nucleotide components, see (Bloomfield et al., 2000)].",

            "text": "Mutations resulting from any of the mechanism just summarized can be divided into transitions, transversions (both referred to as point mutations), and insertions and deletions (referred to as indels) (Fig. 2.3\n). The latter occurs preferentially at homopolymeric tracts and also at short, repeated, sequences which are prone to misalignment mutagenesis (Fig. 2.4\n). An example is an editing mechanism for some viral mRNAs, such as the phosphoprotein mRNA of the Paramyxovirinae [(Kolakofsky et al., 2005) and references therein]. Other examples in vivo are hot spots for variation in reiterated sequences in complex DNA genomes (Yamaguchi et al., 1998, Barrett and McFadden, 2008, McGeoch et al., 2008), or the insertion of two amino acids (often Ser-Ser, Ser-Gly, or Ser-Ala between residues 69 and 70 of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase), in concert with HIV-1 resistance to nucleoside inhibitors (Winters and Merigan, 2005) (Chapter 8). Hairpin structures in RNA and DNA may also induce deletions as a result of slippage mutagenesis (Pathak and Temin, 1992, Viguera et al., 2001). Transition mutations occur more frequently than either transversions or indels during virus replication. Nucleotide discrimination at the catalytic site of viral polymerases fits this observation because of the more likely replacement of a purine or pyrimidine nucleotide by its structurally more similar nucleotide. In some cases, however, an abundance of indels and similar numbers of transitions and transversions have been recorded (Cheynier et al., 2001, Malpica et al., 2002). The molecular bases of such unexpected behavior regarding mutational spectra are not well understood.",

Silent or synonymous mutations are those that do not give rise to an amino acid substitution despite being located in a protein-coding region of a genome. Their occurrence is due to the degeneracy of the genetic code: the same amino acid can be coded for by two or more triplets (codons), with the exception of AUG for methionine and UGG for tryptophan. Synonymous mutations are not necessarily selectively neutral, neutral meaning that they have no discernible consequence for any viral function. The assumption that synonymous mutations are selectively neutral, and the fact that the early comparison of nucleotide sequences of homologous genes showed a dominance of synonymous over nonsynonymous mutations, contributed to the foundations of the neutral theory of molecular evolution. This theory attributes the evolution of organisms at the molecular level mainly to the random drift of genomes carrying neutral or quasi- (or nearly-) neutral mutations (King and Jukes, 1969, Kimura, 1983, Kimura, 1989). The terms quasi-neutral or nearly-neutral may seem ambiguous to molecular biologists. However, in the formulation of the neutral theory they had a precise meaning of the selection coefficient (a parameter that measures fitness differences) being lower than the inverse of the effective population size, with minor variations in the equations of some formulations (Kimura, 1983).\n",

There are several mechanisms by which synonymous mutations can affect virus behavior: alteration of cis-acting regulatory elements in viral genomes, decrease of the stability of duplex structures within the RNA genome or between viral sequences and miRNAs or siRNAs, or changes of viral gene expression [splicing precision or translation fidelity through the modification of RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions; reviewed in (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2016)].",

Thus, the rate of protein synthesis, an important phenotypic trait for cells and viruses, can be affected by the frequency of alternative synonymous codons present in mRNAs (Richmond, 1970, Akashi, 2001). Not only codon bias, but also specific codons or codon combinations may affect ribosome speed to regulate the folding of nascent proteins during translation (Makhoul and Trifonov, 2002, Rocha, 2004, Aragones et al., 2010, Brule and Grayhack, 2017). As a consequence, generation of rare codons by mutation of abundant codons (or vice versa) can modify viral fitness (Chapter 5). Rare codons may also limit the fidelity of amino acid incorporation when the frequency of the required aminoacyl-tRNAS is low (Ling et al., 2009, Zaher and Green, 2009, Czech et al., 2010). The frequency of codon pairs in RNA genomes is also a fitness determinant relevant to the preparation of attenuated viral vaccines.",

This applies to synonymous, as well as to non-synonymous mutations.\u2022Mutations resulting in chemically conservative amino acid substitutions are more likely to be tolerated than those leading to chemically different amino acids. Tolerability (quantified by substitution matrices among amino acids in protein evolution) should be distinguished from neutrality. A tolerated mutation may cause a reduction in fitness, which is nevertheless compatible with virus replication.\u2022A conservative amino acid substitution may have important biological consequences.\u2022The effect of any individual mutation is context-dependent in two ways: it may depend on other mutations in the same genome (epistasis, see also Section 2.8 and Chapter 5) or on the mutant cloud that surrounds the genome harboring the mutation (effects of complementation, cooperation, or interference, discussed in Section 3.8 of Chapter 3).\u2022The previous points do not deny the influence of random drift of genomes on intrahost and interhost evolution. The currently most accepted view is that positive and negative selection and random drift occur continuously during virus evolution (Chapter 3).\nBox 2.1The effects of mutations on virusesIn noncoding regionsMutations may affect stem-loop or other secondary and higher-order structures involved in regulatory processes through nucleic acid-nucleic acid or nucleic acid-protein interactions. The primary sequence in nonstructured, noncoding regions may also be functionally relevant.In coding regions\n\u2022Synonymous or silent mutations do not affect the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein.\u2022Nonsynonymous mutations give rise to an amino acid substitution in the encoded protein.\u2022Some mutations may generate a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.\nRegarding functional effects\n\u2022Neutral mutations are those that have no functional effects.\u2022Nonneutral mutations can have a broad range of fitness effects: from nearly complete tolerability to lethality.\u2022Most proteins are multifunctional. A nonsynonymous mutation can affect one but not other functions performed by the same protein.\nContext-dependenceThe effect of a mutation may be context-dependent in two manners: it may be affected by other mutations in the same genome (epistasis) or by other genomes of the surrounding mutant spectrum.",

The effect of evolutionary distance on the transition to transversion ratio was observed in the FMDV genome sequence comparisons carried out in our laboratory over several decades, that ranged from analyses of mutant spectra relative to their corresponding consensus sequence to independent viral isolates from disease outbreaks separated by several decades [review of the work on FMDV evolution in (Domingo et al., 1990, Domingo et al., 2003)].

(ii) In the course of evolution, important but transient events of positive selection (termed episodic positive selection) due to one or a few amino acid substitutions may be accompanied by a larger number of synonymous, tolerated mutations. In this situation, \u03c9 computes as \u03c9 < 1, thus indicative of purifying selection despite a critical role of positive selection triggered by one or few nonsynonymous mutations in the evolutionary outcome (Crandall et al., 1999). (iii) In a striking proof of the above arguments, statistically significant mutational biases led to a value of \u03c9 indicative of positive selection in an in vitro evolution experiment simulating pseudogene evolution in which positive selection was not possible (Vartanian et al., 2001); this study represents a warning which is rarely mentioned when discussing the limitations of conclusions based on the value of \u03c9. (iv) A synonymous change may permit the mutant codon to acquire a relevant nonsynonymous change through a point mutation. The term quasisynonymous has been used to describe codons that encode the same amino acid, but that has a different evolutionary potential regarding the amino acids that they can access through a point mutation. Alternative codons for a given amino acid approximate a replicative system to points of sequence space from which a phenotypically relevant change has a different probability (Chapters 3 and 4Chapter 3Chapter 4). (v) Finally, \u03c9 was initially proposed to compare distantly related rather than closely related genomes, as is often the case in the short-term evolution of viruses (Kryazhimskiy and Plotkin, 2008).",

It is used to mean mutation frequency, rate of evolution, and sometimes to mean mutation rate in its real sense (as explained in Section 2.5). A particularly risky habit is to use mutation rate when what is measured is a mutation frequency. Some studies have claimed that they have a replication system devoid of selection, and therefore, the number of mutations counted corresponds to the true mutation rate of the system. This is incorrect. There is no replicative system devoid of selection because at least selection to maintain replication is in continuous operation. Furthermore, as taught by quasispecies dynamics (Stadler, 2016), supported by mutational waves in hepatitis C virus upon prolonged replication in a constant cellular environment (Moreno et al., 2017), the mutant spectrum per se is part of the environment. Since the mutant spectrum is constantly changing, so is the environment in which replication takes place. Unfortunately, some studies have proposed the existence of mutational cold spots (sites at which mutations as a biochemical event occur at a very low frequency) ignoring that negative selection might have eliminated newly arising mutations. These false conclusions imply the existence of genomic regions particularly suitable as drug or antibody targets because they cannot mutate. These are the types of studies and incorrect conclusions that keep perpetuating the problem of control of viral diseases by encouraging antiviral and vaccine designs doomed to failure (Chapters 8 and 9Chapter 8Chapter 9).",

            "text": "The amino acid substitutions in the core polymerase that affect fidelity can be located either close to or away from the active site of the enzyme. The change in fidelity can reach almost one order of magnitude, but virus viability is not compromised. Thus, error rates themselves can be subjected to selection, as supported by theoretical studies on evolvability (Earl and Deem, 2004). Early studies documented heterogeneity in the mutation rates among individual plaque isolates of influenza A virus (Suarez et al., 1992). It is not clear whether mutation rates of viruses have evolved to procure a balance between adaptability and genetic stability, or whether other selective constraints have imposed the observed values. It has been suggested that because of the generally deleterious nature of most mutations, the adaptive value of the high mutation rates for RNA viruses is debatable and that there might have been a trade-off between replication rate and copying fidelity (Elena and Sanjuan, 2005). Mutation rates would be a consequence of rapid RNA replication, and an increase in copying fidelity would come at a cost, resulting in a lower replication rate. A connection between elongation and error rate has been suggested by results with some viral and cellular polymerases [review (Kunkel and Erie, 2005)]. In an early study with the poliovirus RdRp in vitro, an increase in the error frequency was observed when the pH and Mg2+ ion conditions were modified, and the decreased fidelity correlated with increased RNA elongation rate (Ward et al., 1988). A possible connection between elongation rate and copying fidelity cannot be ruled out, but current evidence points to template-copying fidelity as being the result of multiple factors, not necessarily linked to the rate of genome replication (Vignuzzi and Andino, 2010, Campagnola et al., 2015, Domingo and Perales, 2019).",

A poliovirus mutant, whose RdRp displayed a three-to five-fold higher fidelity than the wild-type enzyme, replicated at a slightly lower rate than wild-type virus in cell culture but displayed a strong selective disadvantage regarding the invasion of the brain of susceptible mice (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005, Vignuzzi et al., 2006). The impediment to cause neuropathology was due at least partly to the limited complexity of the mutant spectrum since its broadening through mutagenesis restored the capacity to produce neuropathology. These and other studies have provided evidence that mutant spectrum complexity, by virtue of its impact on fitness, can be a virulence determinant. The work by M. Vignuzzi, J. Pfeiffer, R. Andino, C. Cameron, K. Kirkegaard, and their colleagues on poliovirus fidelity mutants opened a much-needed branch of research in virus evolution and quasispecies implications. As proof of this statement, the field of fidelity mutants is rapidly expanding (Border\u00eda et al., 2016), and references to the information they provide will be made in several chapters.",

            "text": "Theoretical models and experimental observations suggest that mechanisms for error correction had to evolve to maintain functionality of increasingly complex genomes (Swetina and Schuster, 1982, Eigen and Biebricher, 1988, Domingo et al., 2001, Eigen, 2002, Eigen, 2013) (here complexity means genome size, provided no redundant information is encoded). The coronaviruses have the largest genomes among the known RNA viruses, with 30\u201333 kb. This is about 10-fold more genetic information than encoded in the simple RNA bacteriophages, such as MS2 or Q\u03b2. Coronaviruses are replicated by complex RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which include a domain that corresponds to a 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease, proofreading-repair activity. The protein displays exonuclease activity in vitro, and its inactivation affects viral RNA synthesis (Minskaia et al., 2006), and results in increases of about 15-fold in the average mutation frequency (Eckerle et al., 2007, Eckerle et al., 2010). A coronavirus mutant devoid of this repair function is more susceptible to lethal mutagenesis than the corresponding, nonmutated virus (Smith et al., 2013, Smith and Denison, 2013), as expected from a connection between replication accuracy and proximity to an error threshold for the maintenance of genetic information (Chapter 9). Thus, it is likely that a proofreading activity evolved (or was captured from a cellular counterpart) in RNA genomes, whose genomic complexity was in the limit compatible with the fidelity achievable by standard RNA replicases. It would be interesting to discover new RNA viruses with a single RNA molecule longer than 30 Kb as a genome to analyze whether they have evolved more accurate core polymerases or exhibit a proofreading-repair function during replication. Toward the other end of the RNA size scale, viroid RNAs display a mutation rate higher than (or close to the highest) recorded for RNA viruses, consistent with the correlation between genome size and template-copying accuracy (Gago et al., 2009).",

The error rate would decrease to 10\u22125 to 10\u22126 with base selection and proofreading-repair, to about 10\u22127 with the contribution of additional proteins present in the replication complex, and to about 10\u221210 misincorporations per nucleotide with the participation of postreplicative mismatch correction mechanisms (Naegeli, 1997, Kunkel and Erie, 2005, Friedberg et al., 2006). Reduction of bacterial genome size results in the increase of mutation frequency (Nishimura et al., 2017). The error rate of the bacteriophage \u03d529 DNA polymerase is about 10\u22126 without the proofreading exonuclease activity, and it decreases to 10\u22128 with the correcting activity [(de Vega et al., 2010) and references therein]. Postreplicative repair pathways act on double-stranded DNA, but not (or very inefficiently) on RNA or DNA-RNA hybrids. Therefore, the known postreplicative repair systems that operate in cellular DNA do not make a significant contribution to error correction in RNA viruses (Steinhauer et al., 1992).",

Exceptions to the absence of repair activities in simple genetic elements have been described. A satellite RNA of the plant virus turnip crinkle carmovirus evolved a 3\u2032-end RNA repair mechanism. It implicates the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides by the viral replicase using the 3\u2032-end of the viral genome as a template. The mechanism consists probably of template-independent priming at the 3\u2032-end of the damaged RNA to generate wild type, negative strand, and satellite RNA (Nagy and Simon, 1997). A reversible, NTP-dependent excision of the 3\u2032 residue of the nascent nucleic acid product has been described in some retroviruses and hepatitis C virus (Meyer et al., 1998, Jin et al., 2013). This activity is important for drug resistance, and it may also modulate the overall fidelity of some polymerases. It cannot be excluded that some type of point mutation correction may operate in RNA genetic elements of less than 30 Kb. Such putative mechanisms may even diminish mutation rates that would otherwise be prohibitively deleterious, and they do not overshadow high mutation rates as a feature of RNA and some DNA genomes (Table 2.1).",

Most nucleic acid polymerases share a structure that resembles a right hand, with fingers, palm, and thumb domains (Fig. 2.6A\n). Three-dimensional structures of viral RdRps and RTs indicate that interactions between the incoming nucleotide or residues of the template-primer with amino acids of the polymerase must permit displacement of the growing polymerase chain along the channel located at the palm domain of the polymerase Steitz, 1999, Ferrer-Orta et al., 2006, Wu and Gong, 2018 (Fig. 2.6B). The polymerase of classical swine fever virus and other pestiviruses, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus includes an N-terminal extra-domain of about 100 amino acids; its interaction with the palm domain is important for template copying fidelity (Liu et al., 2018). If interactions around the catalytic site to ensure the correct nucleotide incorporation were so strong as to preclude misincorporations, the movement of the growing polynucleotide chain would be hampered. Again, this compromise suggests a match between biochemical and evolutionary needs.",

One of the several steps involved in nucleotide incorporation is the formation of a ternary complex (polymerase with template-primer and the incoming nucleotide) that undergoes a conformational change (reorientation of the divalent ion-complexed triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide). This conformational change activates the complex for phosphoryl transfer, to link the nucleoside-monophosphate to the 3\u2032-terminus of the primer (or growing chain). Steps involved in the nucleotide incorporation are represented in Fig. 2.6C. Both the conformational change and the relative rate of phosphoryl transfer for an incorrect nucleotide versus the correct nucleotide influence the error rate at each site of the growing chain. Critical kinetic constants in Fig. 2.6C that are determined experimentally to quantify relative nucleotide incorporations and misincorporations are Kd,app (expressed as \u03bcM), kpol (expressed as s\u22121), and the ratio kpol/Kd,app (\u03bcM\u22121\n s\u22121) termed the catalytic efficiency. The ratio of kpol/Kd,app for the incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide to kpol/Kd,app for a correct nucleotide gives the frequency of that particular misincorporation, and an assessment of polymerase fidelity [(Castro et al., 2005) and references therein]. Modifications of polymerase residues by site-directed mutagenesis, combined with comparisons of the relevant structures, have identified critical amino acid residues involved in template-copying fidelity.",

Limited incorporation of a deleterious nucleotide can be attained either through specific discrimination against the analog (ribavirin or other) or through a general decrease of all types of misincorporations, that is, a high-fidelity phenotype. Structural modifications of viral polymerases that lead to high fidelity have inspired the design of mutant viral polymerases displaying either an increase or decrease of copying fidelity achieved through a single amino acid substitution (Wainberg et al., 1996, Men\u00e9ndez-Arias, 2002, Mansky et al., 2003, Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003, Arnold et al., 2005, Domingo, 2005, Vignuzzi et al., 2006, Coffey et al., 2011, Gnadig et al., 2012, Meng and Kwang, 2014, Rozen-Gagnon et al., 2014, Borderia et al., 2016).

            "text": "Some viral genomes either isolated from biological samples or evolved in cell culture show biased mutation types (e.g., monotonous G \u2192 A or C \u2192 U substitutions in the same genome), generally at frequencies of around 10\u22122 substitutions per nucleotide (10- to 1000-fold higher than standard mutation rates and frequencies) (Table 2.1). Biased hypermutation was first observed in some defective interfering (DI) RNAs of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Holland et al., 1982), and in variant forms of measles virus, associated with postmeasles neurological disease, such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Cattaneo and Billeter, 1992). Hypermutation is mainly due to the activity of cellular deaminases, such as the apolipoprotein B mRNA and the editing complex (APOBEC), or the adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR) families, that are involved in cellular editing and regulatory functions (Sheehy et al., 2002, Santiago and Greene, 2008, Nishikura, 2010, Stavrou et al., 2014, Pfaller et al., 2018, Venkatesan et al., 2018). In the event of a viral infection, such cellular functions can become part of an innate defense mechanism against the invading virus. Viral proteins (i.e., Vif in HIV-1) bind some APOBEC proteins, thus inhibiting mutagenesis and permitting virus survival (Sheehy et al., 2002). In oncoretroviruses, retroviruses, and hepatitis B virus (HBV), the APOBEC-3 cytidine deaminase acts on single-stranded DNA and results mainly in G \u2192 A and C \u2192 U hypermutation, that may affect 40%\u2013100% of the G residues. The preferred sequence context for G hypermutation in HIV-1 observed in vivo is GpA > GpG > GpT \u2248 GpC. The specific dinucleotide context of the hypermutated sites provides a means to distinguish genomes that have undergone hypermutation by cellular activities from those that are heavily mutated by other mechanisms, such as the action of mutagenic agents (Chapter 9).",

A transition mutation that causes a strong fitness decrease but that still allows residual RNA genome replication will most likely revert following infection or transfection of cells with the mutant construct and subsequent viral replication. Double or triple mutants (preferentially including transversions) should be engineered (when possible according to the genetic code) to study the behavior of a viral mutant with an amino acid replacement of interest that may produce a fitness decrease. As an example, a C \u2192 U transition found in an open reading frame of an RNA virus may convert a Pro into a Ser (CCG \u2192 UCG). Since Ser will revert to Pro through a U \u2192 C transition in the triplet (a common type of misincorporation by most polymerases), Ser should be engineered to be encoded by AGU; in the course of replication, reversion to Pro would require at least two transversions since the codons for Pro are CCU, CCC, CCA, or CCG. Thus, if effects derived from the difference in the primary sequence of the RNA or codon bias do not intervene in the behavior of the viral genome, codons with a high genetic barrier to reversion should be engineered for studies involving viral replication.",

High mutation rates also imply that infection or transfection with debilitated mutant viruses may result in progeny with sequences that differ from the input. V. I. Agol and colleagues have coined the term quasi-infectious to refer to mutant viruses that are capable of yielding progeny, but the progeny differs from the initial genome (pseudorevertants) (Gmyl et al., 1993, Agol and Gmyl, 2018). The difference between the input mutant and the rescued progeny virus will depend on the type of genetic lesion in the input virus and its consequences for virus multiplication. A single point mutation that decreases replication is likely to evolve to yield a true revertant (return to the original sequence) upon replication. If the same reversion depends on two or more mutations, a true revertant will require extended replication for exploration of sequence space (Chapter 3), and selection of compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome (sometimes referred to as second site revertants) becomes an alternative for fitness gain. The term compensatory applies to mutations that compensate for the deleteriousness of other mutations. A typical example is a mutation that decreases the stability of a stem in an RNA stem-loop that functions as a cis-acting element. A compensatory mutation restores a stable stem needed for the activity. Transfection of cells by an engineered virus with some preselected genetic modification (produced either from cDNA copies of a viral genome or by chemical synthesis) may yield progeny genomes, which differ from the parent. If a substantial loss of replicative capacity is produced by a drastic genetic change (an indel, loss of a stem-loop structure, etc.) selection of a true revertant becomes extremely unlikely. The compensatory generation of alternative structures (or constellations of point mutations) that restores replication (partially or completely) becomes an interesting and informative possibility.",

This is because, while some constellations of mutations may be compatible with infectivity, others may not, or may allow limited, suboptimal replication, thus favoring the selection of additional mutations or reversions. The same applies to a synthetic genome based on one of the multiple genomic sequences from a viral isolate. Individual mutations may be detrimental either per se, or by the combined presence of other mutations. The joint effect of different mutations in the same genome is often referred to as epistasis. Mutations that reinforce each other with regard to a viral function are said to produce positive epistasis, and those that interfere with each other produce negative epistasis (also mentioned in Section 2.3). Epistasis in RNA viruses may be blurred by the weight of mutant spectra in determining viral behavior through intergenomic interactions (Chapter 3).",

Engineered \u03d529 DNA polymerases provide a powerful amplification tool in genomics (de Vega et al., 2010). In contrast, the 4220 nucleotides long Q\u03b2 RNA rapidly loses its infectivity when replicated by Q\u03b2 replicase in vitro due to the accumulation of mutations and deletions in the viral RNA (Mills et al., 1967, Sabo et al., 1977). The error-prone Q\u03b2 replicase is not adequate to amplify infectious viral RNA, but it was at the origin of the quasispecies concept to be discussed in Chapter 3.

A commonly used procedure measures similarity values between sequences using a sliding-window scanning method. The recombination crossover point (where the two parental sequences meet) is identified by the point (or region) where the similarity plot crosses from one sequence into another (Salemi and Vandamme, 2004, Martin et al., 2005, Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006, P\u00e9rez-Losada et al., 2015). Crossover points along a viral genome are not distributed at random, either because polymerase detachment from the template is sequence-dependent or because many of the recombination events do not lead to viable progeny. Absence of recombinant viability introduces a parallel with the distinction between mutation rate and mutation frequency (Section 2.5); that is, a difference between what does occur at the biochemical level during replication and what is subsequently observed upon analysis of the replication products. Newly arising recombinants may be subjected to negative selection, and only a viable subset might be detectable in the progeny virus (King, 1988, Lai, 1992). An elegant study by D. J. Evans and colleagues documented \u201cimprecise\u201d enterovirus recombinant intermediates that were lost upon serial virus passage (Lowry et al., 2014). Recombination is viewed as a biphasic process consisting of initial imprecise events followed by a stage of resolution in favor of fit recombinants.",

This observation led the authors to propose a \u201csetpoint genome formula,\u201d which may reflect the control of segment (gene) copy number that may provide some still unrecognized benefit to the multipartite phenotype (see next Section 2.11). In principle, replication of multipartite viruses requires that each cell be coinfected by at least one of each type of particle harboring a different genome type, which in fact represents a remarkable cost for replicative efficiency.

An alternative, not mutually exclusive model is that segmentation confers an advantage because replication of shorter RNA molecules is completed earlier than the unsegmented counterparts (Nee, 1987).

            "text": "An experimental system of genome segmentation is available with the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Its single-stranded RNA genome underwent a modification akin to genome segmentation when the standard virus was subjected to 260 passages in BHK-21 cells at high multiplicity of infection. The experiment was originally intended to investigate the limits of fitness gain following prolonged multiplication in a defined environment, in this case, BHK-21 cells in culture. The starting FMDV had not been well adapted to the BHK-21 cell culture environment since it derived from a diseased swine during a disease outbreak, and it was minimally propagated in BHK-21 cells to obtain a biological clone by plaque isolation. Upon extensive replication of the clone in BHK-21 cells, the virus evolved toward a bipartite genome (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2004). Each of the two pieces of RNA that composed the bipartite (or segmented) genome version contained in-frame deletions affecting trans-acting proteins (Fig. 2.8\n). Each segment in isolation could not infect cells productively, but, when present together, they were infectious by complementation, and killed cells in the absence of standard FMDV. A low multiplicity of infection rapidly selected the full-length genome as a result of recombination of the two parental, defective segments (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2004). The particles containing the shortened RNA were thermally more stable than the standard particles (Ojosnegros et al., 2011), but this difference did not explain the initial trigger of the segmentation event. The solution to this question came with the demonstration that the transition toward genome segmentation was possible because of an extensive exploration of the mutational sequence space by the standard virus. Indeed, the mutations that accumulated during serial passages enhanced the fitness of the segmented genome version to a much higher extent than the fitness of the standard genome (Moreno et al., 2014) (Fig. 2.8). Thus, gradual evolution (drift in sequence space) was a requirement for the major transition toward segmentation, thus adding reassortment to mutation and recombination as potential mechanisms of genetic variation of this laboratory-adapted picornavirus. Cooperation and complementation are discussed in Section 3.8 of Chapter 3.",

Clonality means asexual progeny from a single ancestor. In the case of viruses, clonal evolution emphasizes reproduction without the exchange of genetic material among two or more parental genomes. Sexual reproduction necessarily involves the exchange of genetic material. The question for viruses is interesting because we would be inclined to propose clonal evolution despite considerable promiscuity of recombination and reassortment. A tentative solution was offered based on one assumption and some experimental observations. The assumption is that recombination is not a requirement for viruses to complete their infection cycles. Despite the possibility that recombination might be imprinted in the replication apparatuses (rendering it inherent to replication), its occurrence is not a necessity. The experimental observations are of two sorts. One is that historically recombination and reassortment have been at the origin of the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens [western equine encephalitis virus, pandemic influenza viruses, emergent circulating poliovirus, HIV-1 and HCV recombinants, etc. (Section 2.12)]. The second observation is that recombination-based genome segmentation can occur given the adequate population dynamics and competitive environment, as documented with FMDV (Section 2.11). In consequence, the distinction was made between mechanistically unavoidable but biologically irrelevant, and meaningful recombination (Perales et al., 2015). The latter form of recombination requires prior diversification of parental genomes by mutation and a number of cellular and epidemiological conditions. Despite its relevance to evolutionary transitions and viral emergence, it is not a requirement for virus survival, propagation, and evolution. This marks a contrast with the genomic exchanges associated with sexual reproduction. The proposal is that viruses evolve clonally at widely different time scales (intrahost or within-host evolution vs. long-term evolution at the epidemiological level). Similar arguments apply to mutation. This point will be addressed again in the closing Chapter 10, concerning implications of clonality.",

Mutation originates largely in fluctuations of electronic structure that modify base-pairing properties, and from features of polymerase-template interactions, not subject to regulation, in the sense that we understand the regulation of gene expression or enzymatic activity. Absence of regulation is not incompatible with long-term evolution having shaped the molecular interactions that yield a level of mutagenesis compatible with survival and adaptability. Given the biological consequences of mutation rates, many additional studies are needed for the biological phyla, to quantity not only basal mutation rates but also the possible presence of mutator strains.",

Subsequent levels of selection occur when variant forms expand in multiple rounds of infection first within cells, then within an organism and then at the epidemiological level.

            "text": "The net result of all mechanisms of genetic variation available to a virus is the generation of repertoires of variant genomes for random drift and selective forces to act upon. In other terms, genetic variation sets the scene for the actors of evolution to play their roles, and secure a continuous input of new forms despite subtle or catastrophic environmental perturbations. The same forces that drive general evolution have produced the dominant virus forms we see in nature, with all their nuances in the interaction with cell components. The adaptation of viruses to participate in intracellular processes with cells dictates that genetic variation of viruses has its limits to prevent deleteriousness. This is currently exemplified by the effects of amino acid substitutions in viral polymerases that either increase or decrease template-copying fidelity. Viruses have reached a compromise between the stability of core information and flexibility for adaptability. Although not yet treated in this chapter, viral population numbers are a key parameter in the evolutionary events. Next chapters address some of these questions, not only in general conceptual terms but also in the way evolution affects our daily confrontation with viral disease (see Summary Box).Summary Box\n\u2022Mutation, recombination, and genome segment reassortment are the mechanisms of genetic variation used by DNA and RNA viruses. Mutations are due mainly to changes in the electronic distributions of the standard nucleotides, to damage of nucleotides by external influences, and by alignment alterations of the template relative to product polynucleotide chains. The effect of a mutation can range from being well-tolerated to highly detrimental or lethal.\u2022Mutation frequencies are only an indirect consequence of mutation rates. Their values for viruses whose replication is catalyzed by polymerases devoid of proofreading-repair activity are 105- to 106-fold higher than those displayed by replicative cellular DNA polymerases. Error-prone replication is a hallmark of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses. The larger the amount of genetic information encoded in a viral genome, the lower the mutation rate must be to maintain the genetic message.\u2022Several mechanisms of genetic recombination have been described for DNA and RNA viruses. The best characterized is homologous recombination whose frequency of occurrence is dependent on the replicative machinery, in particular, polymerase processivity. Genome segment reassortment is operative in segmented genomes, and it gives rise to biologically relevant changes, such as an antigenic shift in the influenza type A viruses.\u2022Studies with foot-and-mouth disease virus have shown that extensive evolution of an unsegmented RNA genome has the potential to undergo a recombination-mediated transition akin to genome segmentation. Therefore, segmented and unsegmented forms of RNA viruses need not be considered as completely unrelated classes of genome organization.\u2022Recombination and genome segment reassortment have been viewed as conservative forces to rescue viable genomes from a damaged pool, and also as a means to explore new genomic compositions that deviate from their parents. All forms of genetic variation give rise to repertoires of variant genomes on which selection and random drift act to produce the viral forms that we isolate and study.\n\n",
