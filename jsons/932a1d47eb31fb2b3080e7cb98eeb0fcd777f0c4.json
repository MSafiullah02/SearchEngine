We investigated whether viral URTI is temporally associated with an increase in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration. Episodes of symptomatic RSV or rhinovirus URTI among children <5 years were identified from a longitudinal household study in rural Kenya. lytA and alu PCR were performed on nasopharyngeal samples collected twice-weekly, to measure the pneumococcal concentration adjusted for the concentration of human DNA present. Pneumococcal concentration increased with a foldchange of 3.80 (95%CI 1.95-7.40), with acquisition of RSV or rhinovirus, during 51 URTI episodes among 42 children. In repeated swabs from the baseline period, in the two weeks before URTI developed, within-episode variation was broad; within +/\u2212112-fold range of the geometric mean. We observed only a small increase in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration during RSV or rhinovirus URTI, relative to natural variation. Other factors, such as host response to viral infection, may be more important than nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration in determining risk of invasive disease.",

Under the parent protocol, 47 households were selected that contained at least one infant and one older sibling and were investigated for a period of 6 months covering one RSV season between December 2009 and June 2010. The households were selected from within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System 31 in rural coastal Kenya, from a population of predominantly subsistence farmers. Nasopharyngeal flocked swab (NPFS) specimens were collected and stored in viral transport medium (VTM), containing gentamicin, twice weekly irrespective of symptoms. While the WHO recommended method for nasopharyngeal pneumococcal detection is a swab stored in skim milk-tryptone-glucose-glycerol (STGG) to enable culture-based methods 32 , it is possible to both detect and quantify pneumococcal DNA in VTM 29 . Multiplex real-time PCR was performed on all samples to detect RSV A/B, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronaviruses NL63, E229 & OC43 33 . Additionally, five households underwent rhinovirus typing of all samples positive for rhinovirus by sequencing of the VP4-VP2 junction 34 .

A recent study of 4-7 year old children in Wisconsin, USA, found a 10-fold increase in pneumococcal nasopharyngeal density with viral infection, regardless of the presence of symptoms 41 . Neither of these studies assessed changes in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal density at the individual level as we did, and did not look at the magnitude of change relative to the variation within individuals. It appears that the range in pneumococcal density among virus-negative children in Peru, approximately 316-31,600,000, is similarly broad relative to the 4-fold increase in median pneumococcal density with acute respiratory infection. In addition, nasopharyngeal samples were collected monthly in Peru, and four times in a year in Wisconsin, as opposed to twice weekly in our study.

Basic science, using human respiratory cell lines and mouse models, has demonstrated that RSV infection increases pneumococcal concentration, decreases bacterial clearance and promotes pneumococcal adherence. The host inflammatory response to respiratory viral infection may trigger pneumococcal dispersion from biofilms. The modest increase in pneumococcal concentration seen in both this study and the American studies 27,41 , on the context of large fluctuations in density of carriage between and within individuals, may indicate that increasing nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration is not a prerequisite to triggering pneumococcal invasion into the bloodstream or translocation into the lungs. Other effects of respiratory viruses may be more important; such as the inflammatory host response, volume of coryza, laryngeal compromise from coughing and possibly changing the expression of pneumococcal genes for phase-change to a more invasive phenotype. We also do not fully understand the relative contributions of pneumococcal serotype and strain. Certainly, some serotypes are more invasive than others, and virulence factors other than capsule also play a role 42, 43 .",

Some ecological studies have found significant associations between peak viral detection and peak pneumococcal disease with a lag of one week to one month, others have found associations without applying a lag [8] [9] [10] . We chose to study samples before, during and up to one month after viral infection. We did not find a significant decline in pneumococcal concentrations after RSV or rhinovirus URTIs in Kenyan children when the viral episodes were combined, but we did note that the decline in concentration was significant after RSV episodes if considered alone. It is possible that the effects of viral infection on pneumococcal concentration are different for different viruses, including other viruses that we did not study, such as influenza or human metapneumovirus. However, the fold-change of approximately a half is still small relative to variation in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration within and between individuals.",

Although quantification of pathogens in blood is well established through real-time PCR the estimation of pneumococcal burden in the nasopharynx is complicated by the variable volume of nasal secretions with URTI and the variable mass of specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab. To control for these limitations, we used simultaneous quantification of human DNA in the same specimens to standardize all measurements of pneumococcal DNA.",

This is biologically plausible, because symptomatic viral infection can be expected to increase nasopharyngeal secretions, potentially resulting in a greater volume of sample collected into the swab transport medium. However, the adjustment made little difference to the results, suggesting that the nasopharyngeal flocked swab is efficient at collecting a standard volume of secretion from the posterior nasopharyngeal mucosa.",

In a non-linear system it is possible that a modest rise in pneumococcal concentration due to viral URTI would increase the risk of transmission or of invasion. However, this would only occur if the range of concentrations observed in nature were coincident with the point of greatest dynamic range in the risk function. Without further information on the risk functions with pneumococcal concentration, it is difficult to argue that the relatively small changes in concentration observed in temporal association with viral URTI are important mediators of transmission or of invasive risk. This does not disprove that viral infections are on the causal pathway of pneumococcal disease but rather implies that the link between viral URTI and pneumococcal disease may not be as simple as an increase in pneumococcal density.",
