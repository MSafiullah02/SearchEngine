Furthermore, in North America and elsewhere, the phenomenon of community-acquired MRSA is being seen, particularly in EDs, in patients without known risk factors for healthcare-associated MRSA.6 We have documented that anything that prolongs patients' ED stay may adversely affect patient welfare and compound overcrowding.7 Most national and local guidelines on the prevention and control of MRSA largely focus on inpatients but their implementation has implications for the ED. Prolonging patients' stay in the ED will further compound overcrowding, which is a recognised contributor to spread of hospital-acquired infection.8\n",

Triage is the systematic prioritisation of patients. The Manchester Triage System uses a series of criteria to decide what level of priority patients should have on the basis of their presentation. The National Triage scale from the UK is used in many EDs and is a five-point scale from immediate (red), very urgent (orange), urgent (yellow), standard (green) to non-urgent (blue).9\n",

            "text": "Overcrowding in EDs is a distressing and potentially dangerous phenomenon in many health systems. In our hospital, the elderly, those with prior colonisation with MRSA and women wait longest for an acute hospital bed when they require emergency admission. The research hospital has insufficient acute beds to provide for emergency admissions and this is further compounded by the fact that many patients in the hospital experience delayed discharges owing to lack of nursing home beds or step-down facilities in the catchment area. The reason for the delay for females may be due to the fact that our hospital does not usually house males and females in the same bay of a ward, and, as more males are admitted as emergencies, finding a \u2018female bed\u2019 can be problematic. The expected time for admission from time of arrival in the ED was a median of 22.6 h for RG patients compared with 19.9 h for NRG patients. The additional 2.7 h for those requiring selective screening and in an individual patient sick enough to require hospital admission on an already unacceptably long wait for a hospital bed is of concern, and further compounds overcrowding in our ED. Paradoxically, the implementation of screening to identify patients early who require isolation or cohorting in hospital impacts negatively on the provision of emergency care. Overcrowding in EDs has already been shown to increase ambulance diversions to other units, delay treatments, increase waiting times and walkouts and lead to greater lengths of hospital stay as well as increasing patient morbidity and mortality.7\n",

Being aged >65 years, being female or having MRSA should not mean that the patient will have a longer wait in the ED when they require acute admission. Being able to clarify the patient's MRSA status sooner would probably help to facilitate earlier transfer to a bed. Polymerase chain reaction testing for MRSA may be of benefit in this regard. Hospital ward staff are reluctant to accept patients from our ED with MRSA without there being an isolation room available because of the risk of cross-infection. Clearly, leaving patients for prolonged periods in the ED, which is the most overcrowded part of any acute hospital, is not appropriate. Acute hospitals must accept that factors contributing to the spread of infection are important on inpatient wards and in the ED. Having identified the problem, the research hospital has now allocated areas within each ward that allow for the setting up of cohorts of patients with MRSA, if no single rooms are available. Another alternative suggestion is not to selectively screen patients during the ED component of their hospital stay, if doing so would make ward placement more difficult, and to allow patients to be screened on the wards.",
