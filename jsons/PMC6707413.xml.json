This pathology is associated with high morbidity and frequently requires prolonged hospitalisation and invasive procedures. To date, several reports have shown a reduction in the overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) after the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, PCV-7, and in some studies the rate increase has been associated with an increase of infections caused by non-PCV7 serotypes [11\u201314]. Changes in the distribution of S. pneumoniae serotypes over time may be associated with changes in clinical type of IPD. The association of serotype 1 with PPE was described in the pre-penicillin and prevaccine eras. Currently, studies have shown an emergence of PPE caused by serotype 1 [15\u201319]. In this study, we better define the aetiology of severe pneumonia and PPE in hospitalised children using molecular assays. We also identify the S. pneumoniae serotypes in the positive specimens.",

Furthermore, data is presented regarding viral and bacterial co-infections in severe pneumonia. Our findings confirm that S. pneumoniae is the most common bacterial agent identified in CAP and PPE [19, 22]. S. pneumoniae was identified in few samples by blood culture (8%) and by pleural effusion culture (4%). The S. pneumoniae detection rose to 76% in pleural effusion samples using the FTD Respiratory Pathogen Plus assay molecular multiplex RT and BinaxNOW\u00ae S. pneumoniae latex agglutination test. Our data also confirms that conventional bacterial cultures are not sensitive enough to identify the aetiological agent of pneumonia. Before admission, 54% (15/28) of the children in the PPE group were given one or more antibiotics. This could explain why pleural effusion samples were negative for bacteria using conventional culture in the CAP + PPE cases, as has been previously observed [17]. A bacterial aetiological agent can usually be identified when using the BinaxNOW\u00ae or molecular assays, even in patients treated with antibiotic therapy [24\u201326].",

            "text": "In both populations, S. pneumoniae was also found in nasopharyngeal aspirates (77%) using a molecular assay, despite the fact that 44% of the patients received the PCV-7. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae is common, especially in young children, thus upper airway samples are not appropriate for pneumococcal culture or direct detection [29]. The vaccine impact analysis for infectious disease is an indirect approach to the evaluation of the importance of the disease when the diagnosis is difficult. The PCV-7 may be used as a probe to define the burden of pneumococcal disease and to better characterise the clinical presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia [11\u201312, 16]. The reduction in the overall incidence of radiological defined pneumonia suggests that about 30% of episodes of pneumonia are due to S. pneumoniae. The PCV-7 was licensed in Europe in 2001 and has been shown to be immunogenic in young children with respect to serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F. These serotypes account for between 43% and 75% of IPD in children under the age of 18 years in Western Europe [14]. Serotype 1 remains the most common cause of PPE [11\u201313, 27\u201329], but serotypes 3 and 19A are emerging [11]. In our study, we found different serotypes not included in PCV7, including: serotype 1 (9 CAP + PPE), serotype 3 (5 CAP + PPE), serotype 7F (3 CAP + PPE) and serotype 19A (1 CAP + PPE) using our S. pneumoniae molecular serotyping assay. The same serotype was identified in paired nasopharyngeal and pleural effusion samples in 10 out of 19 CAP + PPE cases. These data are very relevant for epidemiological studies and to better understand the PPE increase frequency despite the PCV-7 introduction. One of the contributing factors could be the selection pressure induced by vaccination on nasopharyngeal carriage. Continued surveillance will provide crucial data to help to determine vaccine efficacy for the general paediatric population. Moreover, it could also explain the vaccine impact on the frequency of infections caused by pneumococcal isolates with antibiotic resistance and / or serotypes not included in vaccine.",

            "text": "The exact role of each of the respiratory pathogens in the origin of pneumonia remains to be clarified. However, it has been speculated that viruses may induce pneumonia, either directly or by rendering the host more susceptible to bacterial infection [29\u201330]. IPD exhibits seasonal variations with peak incidence during the winter season in temperate regions of the world. A variety of host and environmental factors have been explored as potential explanations for the seasonality of IPD including viral respiratory tract infections [29\u201332]. Viral carriage is rare in healthy subjects and detecting a respiratory virus in upper airway sample either by culture, antigen detection or PCR is considered as diagnosis for the aetiology of LRTI. In nasopharyngeal samples, the viral distribution was similar between the 2 population groups, CAP + PPE and CAP. As already described for bronchiolitis, the number of patients infected with respiratory viruses is much higher in infants less than 24 months old [33]. However, in this study the number of dual viral infections is significantly higher in the PPE population which suggests that viral co-infection seems to have an impact on the severity of pneumonia. Other studies [29\u201332] have analysed the correlation between IPD and circulating respiratory viruses such as influenza. Up to now, the occurrence of viral co-infections in acute LTRI has received little attention. In a previous study, we described the impact of the dual viral infection in infants admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit associated with severe bronchiolitis [33]. The proportion of viral co-infection in children hospitalised with pneumonia is probably underestimated. Physicians should be aware of the potential outcomes associated with viral co-infection and should consider the impact in children with respiratory illness.",
