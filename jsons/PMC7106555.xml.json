Rhinovirus increases the intensity of respiratory symptoms such as decreased appetite, muscle aches, headache, sore throat, increased sputum production, wheezing, and chest pain [7]. Other viruses such as adenovirus (19/154 of positive samples) or Enterovirus (15/154) can be found in the respiratory tracts of even asymptomatic children and can persist for months after respiratory infection [9], [10]. By contrast, other viruses detected in our study such as parainfluenza (11/154), influenza (9/154), respiratory syncytial virus (5/154), and metapneumovirus (3/154) are usually present only in symptomatic children and are very rare in healthy children [11], [12].",
