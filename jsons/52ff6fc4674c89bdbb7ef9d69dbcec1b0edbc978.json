This highly contagious virus has already caused an increasing number of infections and deaths, and the scientific community is facing new challenges to fight the ongoing outbreak. As no specific therapeutics and vaccines are available for disease control, countries lockdown, social distancing and quick detection of cases are currently the main weapons against the virus. Diagnostic and serological tools, by detecting SARS-CoV-2 carriers and immunized recovered patients as soon as possible, are part of this fighting strategy, and necessary to consider a return to normal life. In this context of moving and exponential research, viral inactivation procedures are urgently needed to allow safe experimental laboratory conditions for staff. Amplification of the viral RNA by quantitative RT-PCR is currently the gold standard procedure for diagnosis recommended by the World Health Organization (1). Viral RNA extraction kits sometimes require an initial lysis step at 70\u00b0C or more for 5 minutes, but not always. Heat inactivation of the virus is also needed for serum treatment before ELISA and serological assays.",
