We study spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a progressive degenerative disorder of the neuromuscular system caused by the polyQ androgen receptor (AR). Using a knock-in mouse model of SBMA, AR113Q mice, we show that E3 ubiquitin ligases which are a hallmark of the canonical muscle atrophy machinery are not induced in AR113Q muscle. Similarly, we find no evidence to suggest dysfunction of signaling pathways that trigger muscle hypertrophy or impairment of the muscle stem cell niche. Instead, we find that skeletal muscle atrophy is characterized by diminished function of the transcriptional regulator Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2), a regulator of myofiber homeostasis. Decreased expression of MEF2 target genes is age-and glutamine tract length-dependent, occurs due to polyQ AR proteotoxicity, and is associated with sequestration of MEF2 into intranuclear inclusions in muscle. Skeletal muscle from R6/2 mice, a model of Huntington disease which develops progressive atrophy, also sequesters MEF2 into inclusions and displays age-dependent loss of MEF2 target genes. Similarly, SBMA patient muscle shows loss of MEF2 target gene expression, and restoring MEF2 activity in AR113Q muscle rescues fiber size and MEF2-regulated gene expression.

AR113Q males develop a progressive neuromuscular phenotype which mimics important aspects of the SBMA phenotype (Supplemetary Fig. 1 ) [83] . Because the AR gene is on the X chromosome, males are hemizygous for either the mutant or WT allele. Using AR113Q mice, we performed the same denervation experiment at 26 weeks and examined the gastrocnemius 3 days post-denervation (Fig. 1b) . While AR113Q mice also showed significant induction of Atrogin-1 and MuSA1, MuRF1 was not significantly induced, and the amount of induction of all three genes was blunted compared to WT mice. This indicates that SBMA mice are impaired in their ability to induce the E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for atrophy following denervation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[83,", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 354, "end": 357, "text": "84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 623, "end": 627, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 614, "end": 620, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 862, "end": 871, "text": "(Fig. 1b)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "AR113Q muscle atrophy is independent of ubiquitin-proteasome machinery induction"}, {"text": "We next examined expression of these E3 ubiquitin ligases in AR113Q mice across multiple time points.

In fact, AR113Q males display age-dependent suppression of the MuRF1 and Atrogin-1 genes (Fig. 1c,  d) . These data complement a recent study from our group demonstrating diminished proteasome expression and function in AR113Q muscle and show that SBMA atrophy has several distinctions from other forms of atrophy [53] . Similar to quadriceps muscle, induction of MuRF1, Atrogin-1, and MuSA1 does not occur in the levator ani/ bulbocavernosus muscle (LABC), a pelvic floor muscle which undergoes severe atrophy due to high levels of AR expression ( Fig. 1c-e, right) . We observed no induction of E3 ubiquitin ligases in comparison to either WT or AR21Q males. (AR21Q males were generated using the same gene targeting strategy but express a normal CAG repeat length [1] and thereby control for effects of humanizing the mouse AR gene). Previous work has demonstrated that AR21Q mice are phenotypically similar to WT, establishing that the neuromuscular phenotype of AR113Q mice is due solely to polyglutamine tract expansion above the pathogenic threshold [83] .

The MEF2 family of transcription factors consists of four members, with Mef2a, Mef2c, and Mef2d most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle (Table S4 ). Prior research demonstrates that MEF2A, -C, and -D bind the same consensus sequence [82] . Additionally, MEF2A, -C, and -D are capable of compensating for knockout of one but not all 3 Mef2 genes in satellite cells, suggesting redundant function of MEF2 family members in skeletal muscle [39] . Similar compensation of MEF2 family members has been demonstrated in the CNS, suggesting that functional redundancy is conserved between organ systems [41] . Mef2c expression is known to make important contributions to sarcomere integrity and maintenance [61] . Supporting this notion, MEF2 proteins regulate the expression of a large number of genes encoding structural proteins of the sarcomere [51, 78] , and skeletal muscle-specific deletion of Mef2c leads to rapid deterioration of myofibers and disorganized sarcomeres [61] . Additional studies have demonstrated that postnatal growth is impaired by skeletal musclespecific Mef2c deletion in mice [3] . Moreover, activation of MEF2 by silencing of the repressor Mrf4 or by overexpression of the constitutively active form, drives skeletal muscle hypertrophy in vivo, defining MEF2 as a key regulator of muscle hypertrophy [51] . In support of this role, knockout Fig. 7 CA-MEF2 rescues AR113Q muscle atrophy and target gene expression. a-d AR113Q mice were transfected with CA-MEF2 in one leg and DBD-MEF2 in the contralateral leg.

Several proteins have been identified as inhibiting MEF2 activity, either by direct binding or localization to MEF2-binding sites, including HDAC4 [16] , Mrf4 [51] , and NCoR1 [81] . Interestingly, MEF2 expression and nuclear translocation are not altered in AR113Q muscle, but its nuclear localization is disrupted by interaction with soluble polyQ AR and sequestration into insoluble inclusions, suggesting that co-aggregation is a final consequence of aberrant interaction with polyQ AR. Similar findings are observed in R6/2 muscle (Fig. 6) , where the HDAC4-myogenin axis has been shown to be re-expressed [47] . This sequestration may reflect the fact that the MEF2C transactivating domain is intrinsically disordered and prone to aggregation ( Supplementary  Fig. 4G ). These findings align with our observation that MEF2 impairment is mediated by polyQ AR proteotoxicity rather than loss of function (Fig. 5) . Whether sequestration of MEF2 into morphologically visible inclusions is necessary for functional impairment is uncertain; it is possible that its aberrant association with soluble polyQ species in the nucleus may also disrupt activity and that sequestration into protein aggregates is the end stage of this process.

To overcome these limitations, we propose that in addition to direct modulation of MEF2, a strategy by which mutant AR is targeted to prevent aggregation and sequestration of MEF2, such as by administration of antisense oligonucleotides [38] or modulation of the HSP70/90 chaperone machinery [23, 79] may be synergistic as a long-term therapeutic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 332, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 343, "end": 347, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 368, "end": 372, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 406, "end": 409, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 410, "end": 413, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 414, "end": 417, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 418, "end": 421, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 757, "end": 761, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 812, "end": 816, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 817, "end": 820, "text": "79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The sequestration and functional impairment of transcriptional regulators, including cAMP response element-binding protein (CBP) [75] , specific protein-1 (Sp1) [21, 35] , and TAFII130 [21] , has been implicated in neuronal dysfunction in polyQ disease.
