The huge influx of Covid-19 patients into hospitals in affected countries has led to disruption of usual clinical activity, with cancellation of elective in-patient and outpatient activity. [3] [4] [5] In many cases, normal ambulatory care has been replaced by remote management using a variety of telemedicine approaches. 6 Even non-Covid-19 related emergency department activity has decreased markedly in many countries, as reported in a previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. 7,8 As a result, there is concern that deaths from non-Covid-19 causes could increase, due to reduced routine care. One way to address these two questions is to examine recent observed population-based mortality rates, compared with expected rates, and compare any excess in deaths with the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. We have analysed these data for 4 countries which have provided such data on a routine basis for at least 5 years.",

We included the constituent countries of the United Kingdom which collect, collate and report national data separately (for the purposes of this report, England and Wales were considered one country as their data are reported together) and the Netherlands in this analysis. For the European countries included and New York, we extracted reports of the numbers of deaths related to Covid-19 published by national agencies and death registration authorities that had been publicly reported by 16 April 2020. 9-12 Data on the number of deaths due to Covid-19, and the total number of deaths registered in the population over the same period were collected. Historical numbers of deaths or average number of deaths from 2015-2019 for the same week were extracted from available records (data were available only for 2015-2018 for New York State and 2015-2017 for New York City). The number of excess deaths was defined as the difference between the observed number of deaths and the number of deaths expected according to the observed number from 2015-2019.

The increase in mortality is not wholly explained by deaths attributed to Covid-19. Indeed, only between 51 and 60% of the excess in deaths can be explained by official Covid-19 reports. The data from New York state support these findings, with an even more striking picture in New York city. The two most likely explanations for the discrepancy between the overall excess of deaths and the extra deaths explained by Covid-19 are either there are additional deaths caused (or contributed to) by Covid-19, but not recognised as such, or that there is an increase in deaths from non-Covid-19 causes, potentially resulting from diminished routine diagnosis and treatment of other conditions. We believe that both are likely. In many reports of mortality attributed to Covid-19, the focus has been on deaths occurring in hospital. Similarly, in some countries due to limited testing for SARS-Cov-2 infection, deaths among elderly people in care homes and other places potentially caused (or contributed to) by Covid-19 are not attributed to that condition. 13 There are anecdotal reports of people with Covid-19-like symptoms frightened to attend hospital or choosing to remain at home because of fear of dying in isolation from their family in hospital.",

[18] [19] [20] If not already, in due course, mental health problems and domestic violence may also add to the non-Covid-19 excess in mortality, although reduction in industrial deaths, fatal road traffic accidents and deaths related to air pollution may offset increases from these other causes. 21, 22 Our analysis of three European countries, with New York state and city added for comparison, was driven by availability of the required data. It would have been of interest to include Italy and Spain in these analyses. Data on overall mortality were available for some regions in Italy: in the North, most affected by the pandemic, there was a 65% increase in the numbers of deaths observed, compared to expected, in the period from the time of the first reported Covid-19 case to the beginning of April. 23 Similar data for Central and Southern regions, areas less affected by the pandemic, showed a 10% increase in the observed number of deaths, compared to expected. We could not obtain Spanish national data for the dates of our analysis in the other countries and Spain is also in a different phase of its Covid-19 outbreak. However, Spanish data for the period 17 March to 11 April 2020, spanning the peak weeks of the pandemic in that country, show a substantial increase in the number of deaths observed, compared to expected. 24 Unlike the other countries we studied, most of the excess mortality was attributed to Covid-19.
