The aim of this study was to identify and validate appropriate reference genes as internal controls for RT-qPCR experiments in rubella virus (RV)-infected Vero and MCF-7 cell lines using SYBR green fluorescence. The software programs geNorm and NormFinder and the DDC t calculation were used to determine the expression stability and thus reliability of nine suitable reference genes. HPRT1 and HUEL, and HUEL and TBP were identified to be most suitable for RT-qPCR analysis of RV-infected Vero and MCF-7 cells, respectively. These genes were used as normalizers for transcriptional activity of selected cellular genes. The results confirm previously published microarray and Northern blot data, particularly on the transcriptional activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the nuclear body protein SP100. Furthermore, the mRNA level of the mitochondrial protein p32 is increased in RV-infected cells. The effect on cellular gene transcription by RV-infection seems to be cell line-specific, but genes of central importance for viral life cycle appear to be altered to a similar degree. This study does not only provide an accurate and flexible tool for the quantitative analysis of gene expression patterns in RV-infected cell lines. It also indicates, that the suitability of a reference gene as normalizer of RT-qPCR data and the host-cell response to RV-infection are strictly cell-line specific.",

However, severe damage and fetal malformation may occur after infection of seronegative women in early pregnancy. The molecular basis for RV teratogenesis remains largely unknown.

            "text": "The methods of choice to analyze the transcription of cellular genes are real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Northern blot, and DNA microarray analysis. While microarray analysis allows gene expression profiling of a high number of genes, precise quantification of gene expression levels can only be achieved by RT-qPCR [Huggett et al., 2005; Nygaard and Hovig, 2009] . For normalization of gene expression it is necessary to determine an endogenous reference gene that shows stable expression in virus-infected cells in comparison to the mock-infected control. Normalization against internal control genes allows for compensation of differences in sample preparation and processing as the reference gene and the gene of interest are subjected to the same experimental conditions [Vandesompele et al., 2002; Radoni\u0107 et al., 2005] . So far, there is no universal reference gene that can be used for all possible experimental conditions. The aim of this study was to quantify relative changes in the mRNA expression level of cellular genes encoding proteins such as the poly(A)-binding protein [Ilkow et al., 2008] and the mitochondrial protein p32 [Beatch et al., 2005] that are known to interact with RV, and to validate and precisely quantify microarray data that is available for RV [Mo et al., 2007; Adamo et al., 2008] using RT-qPCR. Several studies have investigated reference genes in virusinfected cells [Radoni\u0107 et al., 2005; Bernasconi et al., 2006] . As far as we are aware, no such study on normalization factors has been performed for RV-infected cell lines and little is known about the expression of reference genes in RV-infected cell lines. Hence, the Microsoft excel-based applications NormFinder [Andersen et al., 2004] and geNorm [Vandesompele et al., 2002] and the DDC t calculation [Radoni\u0107 et al., 2005] were used in this study to determine the most stable reference genes in RV-infected cell lines. Nine potential reference genes were chosen such that multiple cellular pathways are represented to reduce the likelihood of coregulation of these genes by RV. Reference genes involved in translation were excluded as RV interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein [Ilkow et al., 2008] . Vero and MCF-7 cell lines were chosen for this study as they readily support RV infection. Besides, Vero is the most frequently used cell line for RV infection studies. Additionally, in contrast to the human cell line MCF-7, the primate cell line Vero is unable to induce an interferon response [Diaz et al., 1988] and could thus enable the identification of interferon-induced alterations in gene expression.",

Only in MCF-7 cells the expression level of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the adenine nucleotide carrier SLC25A4 was increased. These alterations appear to be cell-line specific and could at least be in part due to the induction of an interferon response. Additionally, this study includes the first description of an altered expression of p32 in general and of SLC25A4 in RV-infected cells of non-embryonic origin. Moreover, it provides the basis for a thorough evaluation of the importance of distinct cellular proteins and cellular pathways for RV replication and pathogenesis.",

The C t value is defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescence signal to reach a certain threshold of detection and thus directly correlates with the amount of template. The range of C t values for each reference gene is illustrated by a boxplot in Figure 1 . This boxplot highlights the variation in expression level of RV (moi 1 and 10) and mock-infected Vero and RV (moi 2)-and mockinfected MCF-7 cells. A median C t value below 30 indicates a high RNA transcription level [Radoni\u0107 et al., 2005] . The nine reference genes under investigation displayed a C t value range from 16 to 31, which groups them among genes with high RNA transcription (Fig. 1) . The average C t value of each reference gene is given in Table II . The highest expression level with the lowest C t value of 16 cycles was displayed by PPIA, while the lowest expression level with the highest C t value of 31 was exhibited by RPII. The lowest transcription range, as an indicator of constant RNA transcription, was observed for HPRT1 and HUEL in RV-infected Vero cells (range \u00bc 1 and 1.27, respectively), and for HUEL and HPRT1 in The C t values of RT \u00c0ve samples appear to be due to retropseudogenes (P) that lead to amplification of contaminating genomic DNA and could thus possibly interfere with RT-qPCR results.

However, HUEL was either the best or one of the two best ranked genes by geNorm, NormFinder, and DDC t calculation. Therefore, the expression pattern of the remaining eight reference genes was normalized against HUEL and calculated for mock-infected and RV-infected MCF-7 cells for dpi 1 and 3 (expression at dpi 1 for mock-infected cultures was set as 100%).

A positive DDC t value indicates downregulation of the RNA transcription of the respective gene, whereas a negative DDC t value suggests upregulation of the RNA transcription of the respective gene. The DDC t values for the nine reference genes applied in this study are shown in Figure 4 as the mean with standard deviation of two (RV-infected MCF-7, moi 2) and four (RV-infected Vero cells, moi 1 and 10) independent biological samples run in duplicate in RT-qPCR reactions. The DDC t value of PPIA in RVinfected Vero and MCF-7 cells shows a high standard deviation indicative of a high variation in RNA transcription. geNorm and NormFinder also ranked PPIA as a reference gene with low stability (Fig. 3) . On the contrary, HPRT1 and HUEL were approved by DDC t equation as stable reference genes and show almost no variation between infected and mock-infected Vero and MCF-7 cells. Thus, data by geNorm and NormFinder agree with DDC t values and DDC t calculation confirms HUEL and HPRT1 as stable and suitable reference genes in RV-infected Vero and TBP and HUEL in RVinfected MCF-7 cells. Data are given for paired cell samples (mock-and RV-infected, n \u00bc 24). The two most stable reference genes identified by geNorm can not be grouped any further as geNorm algorithm is intended to identify a pair of most stable reference genes. ",

The highest level of transcription induction (1.5-fold in Vero and up to ninefold in MCF-7) was seen for SP100 upon infection with RV (moi 1). The expression pattern of the genes encoding the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and retinoblastoma protein (RB) was also investigated. While the mRNA of p53 was found to be decreased by 0.3-fold in Vero cells at 3 dpi (moi 5), its expression level increased by 2.5-fold in RV-infected MCF-7 cells (moi 5). Vero cells (moi 5) showed a 1.3-fold increase in the expression of RB, but the mRNA level of RB remained unchanged in MCF-7 cells. In contrast to the MCF-7 cell line, Vero cells are deficient in the type 1 interferon response.

The infectious cDNA clone of RV, Robo 503 was used to establish a standard curve and to characterize RT-qPCR conditions. The sensitivity of the RT-qPCR was estimated to be 10-30 copies of plasmid DNA per reaction. PCR efficiency was 84% as determined by LinReg software (Table II) .

Other studies have also shown that ranking differences between geNorm and NormFinder can occur [Skovgaard et al., 2007] . However, the least variation of reference gene expression in mock-and RV-infected cell lines over time of incubation was associated with the first-choice reference genes suggested by geNorm (Fig. 3C ). This is supported by calculating the expression values of two representative genes (p53 and SP100) for mock-and RV-infected MCF-7 cells through normalization against HUEL, TBP, and ECHS. The resulting data revealed, that normalization against either HUEL or TBP, or the combination of both resulted in almost identical expression values, while ECHS or ECHS together with HUEL revealed large differences (3-to 14-fold) in calculated gene expression (data not shown). The optimal reference gene must be carefully evaluated and considered within the experimental context. So far no thorough study of reference gene expression has been performed for RV. However, HPRT1 and GAPDH were used as reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of RV-infected human embryo fibroblasts and the adult lung fibroblast cell line Hs888Lu [Adamo et al., 2008] .

The expression of the SP100 gene is inducible by interferon alpha and beta, but also by interferon gamma [Gr\u00f6 tzinger et al., 1996] . This explains why the induction of SP100 is higher in RV-infected MCF-7 and ECV304 than in Vero cells, which lack a type I interferon inducibility [Diaz et al., 1988] . We were also able to confirm Northern blot data for the increased transcription level of p21 in RV-infected Vero cells [Mo et al., 2007] . However, a discrepancy in the expression level of p53 and RB was detected. Mo et al. have reported a constant transcription level for p53 and RB in RV-infected Vero cells whereas our data reveals a 0.3-fold decrease in p53 and a 1.3-fold increase in the RB mRNA level at 3 dpi. RT-qPCR is more sensitive than Northern blot data and allows for precise quantification. Hence it could be possible that the slight, but significant change in p53 and RB transcription could be missed by Northern blot analysis. The 2.5fold increase in the p53 mRNA level in RV-infected MCF-7 is probably due to induction of a type I interferon response, which has been shown to upregulate p53 transcription [Takaoka et al., 2003] .",

The p32 protein is a multifunctional and multicompartmental protein, which participates in the antiviral response of the host cell. Although several viral proteins interact with p32 and modulate its function, mRNA and protein level of p32 were reported to be constant between mock-and virus-infected cell populations [Xu et al., 2009 ]. However, the mRNA level of p32 is increased in both, RV-infected Vero and MCF-7 cells. The influence of RV on p32 transcription appears to be quite unique among viruses. Data presented in this paper highlight p32 as an important cellular interactor of RV. However, Western blot analysis of RV-infected Vero cells revealed no significant difference in the protein level of p32 (data not shown).",

This enables the flexible and precise analysis of the change in transcription of cellular genes induced by RV with RT-qPCR analysis. While microarray data provides a general survey of gene expression by a high-throughput screen, the RT-qPCR format illustrated in this study can be easily adopted to the analysis of different cell lines and different experimental conditions and thus extends microarray data. It was shown by this study that the cellular response to a virus infection varies remarkably between different cell lines. However, transcription of genes that are of general importance to RV appears to be ubiquitously altered.",
