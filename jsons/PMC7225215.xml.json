Yet the SARS-CoV-2 was also found with R0 [4]. It has more clinical symptoms of dyspnoea while headaches and diarrhoea are rare [5]. As to radiological features, COVID-19 usually has abnormalities on chest computed tomography (CT), of which the most typical one is ground-glass opacity, and the lesions are generally multiple and located in the posterior or peripheral lung [6]. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 normally develop symptoms in 2\u22127 days after infection with a rapid disease progress. They usually die of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure caused by cytokine storm [5].",

Several standardised data collection forms were designed first and relevant data were then correspondingly extracted by two experienced doctors and a third senior doctor would perform the final review to ensure data quality. Laboratory indicators of blood routine test, blood coagulation and their medical reference ranges were collected. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens was detected by real-time RT-PCR methods, issued by the Chinese CDC [7]. All the thin-layer images were collected in the format of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM). Then the imaging signs and their features were extracted using a double-blind method, by which two intermediate radiologists in respiratory medicine (with more than 5 years' experience) would read and report the images independently and their results would finally be reviewed and confirmed by a senior doctor (engaged in imaging diagnosis for more than 15 years). Radiological findings such as lesions, lesion size (the longest diameter of the lesion) and radiological patterns were extracted. In addition, to evaluate the lesion size accurately, a diagnosis system for novel coronavirus pneumonia based on artificial intelligence (AI), was employed to analyse CT images using CT value to measure volume ratio of pneumonia automatically, which had been used at this hospital in early January [8\u201311].",

As of 28 January 2020, a total of 101 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, and classified into four different groups (uncomplicated illness, mild, severe and critical pneumonia) according to the disease severity. Among these patients, 86 and 11 patients were diagnosed as mild and severe pneumonia, as well as one uncomplicated illness and two critical pneumonia on admission. The median age of these patients was 51.0 years (IQR 37.0\u201361.0), 34% were medical staff and 47% has suspected nosocomial infections, this is caused by the rapid person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 with less personal protection. Fever (68%), cough (50%), fatigue (23%) and myalgia (16%) are the most symptoms on admission. Fifty-one per cent patients have complications, with hypertension (20%), cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease (14%) and diabetes (12%), respectively. The most common patterns on chest CT were pure ground-glass opacity (36%) and ground-glass opacities overlapped with striped shadows (40%). About 26% patients underwent the mechanical ventilation. These findings conform with the previous study of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China [5, 13]. As of 8 February 2020, more than one-third (37, 37%) of patients were cured and discharged, a half (53, 52%) were still hospitalised, while 11 (11%) patients died unfortunately. The median time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was 7 days (IQR 5\u201313), as well as 4.0 days (IQR 2\u20137) for median time from admission to diagnosis. This finding further confirms the viewpoint that the median time from onset to admission was 7 days by Huang et al. [5]. However, the median time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was shortened greatly during January (Figure S2), this is due to the substantial supplies of SARS-Cov-2 detection kit. This sharp downtrend could also be witnessed for median time from admission to diagnosis.",

On admission, most patients had fever (68%), the most common symptom of the disease in the study.

Meanwhile, 19 of 42 get cured in a short period and no death occurred. While, 44 of the 86 mild pneumonia patients progressed to severe condition within 4 days, among which 13 were cured and 11 died. This suggested that we should pay more attention to the disease at an early stage, rather than neglecting the mild illness. Besides, we could see that COVID-19 progresses rapidly within 4 days from mild-to-severe condition, further illustrated by variations in radiological characteristics over time in this study. Indeed, it is significantly crucial to speed up the diagnosis process of suspected cases and make sure all potential patients are able to get access to hospitals for observation and treatment at an early stage. Furthermore, patients with complications could highly develop severe and critical illness as disease progressed. Also whether or not having dyspnoea as initial symptoms and the respiratory frequency in physical examination on admission were both significantly different among groups of different clinical stages (higher probability observed in severe or critical stage than the mild one), suggesting that attention should be paid to the patient's underlying disease and first symptoms when treating COVID-19 [8, 15\u201317].",

Also, the most common lesions were on the posterior and lateral sides of the lower pulmonary lobe. Yet it was light in the shadows of infiltration of inflammation in lung lobe at the beginning, mainly related to its pathological changes, still suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 already affected the lung before symptoms were being recognised. As the disease progressed, an upward trend was observed in the numbers of ground-glass opacities overlapped with striped shadows, of affected pulmonary segments, illustrating that pulmonary fibrosis became more severe and to some extent further suggesting that patients are at risk of irreversible damage to lung function in the future, which may further lead to functional disability and affect the quality of life. Such sequelae occurred in both patients infected with SARS or MERS [11, 18]. Hence, adding supportive treatment to the therapeutic regimen should be taken into consideration to improve patient's immunity, to weaken the damages to the lungs caused by viral pneumonia and to reduce the risk of sequelae. In addition, no significant difference was shown in typical radiological patterns among groups of different clinical stages but mosaic signs and pleural effusion, which might relate to prognosis. Meanwhile, AI-based diagnosis system showed similar results in assessment of lesions size as what was evaluated by the radiologists. It is also worth mentioning that such AI system greatly improved diagnostic efficiency of COVID-19, alleviating the surge in demand of radiologists when the virus is stalking China.",

Some of those indicators were inconsistent with previous studies [13]. In addition, we observed that the amount of albumin and prealbumin in critically or severely ill patients were significantly lower than those of mild ones. Such differences might relate to the cytokine storm caused by the virus at the late stage of the disease and other factors, such as subsequent hypoxia, gastrointestinal dysfunction, endocrine and metabolic disorders, insufficient nutrition intake and the use of ventilator with positive pressure, and increased energy consumption in the body. Eventually, malnutrition would be caused or aggravated. As a negative acute phase response protein and a kind of substance in non-specific host defense, prealbumin can clear the toxic metabolites released in the circulation during the infection process, and therefore its amount reduced in blood as it was gradually consumed. This reminds us to provide nutrition support for these kind of patients [19]. Meanwhile, we found that some inflammation indicators, such as C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A, increased in the early stage of the disease, but higher amounts of them were observed in severe and critical patients than that of mild cases. This might indicate the patients were in the state of acute stress with elevated serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein, which are able to bind various microorganisms' polysaccharides and tissue cells' phospholipids and nucleic acids to activate the immune system, improving immunity and mediating inflammatory responses.",

Therefore, pro-active actions should be taken to accelerate the clinical trial for potential effect drugs, such as Remdesivir, and various drug combinations [9, 20]; meanwhile, more existing drugs on the market, which can enhance immune response, reduce immunopathology and prevent or suppress ARDS, such as metformin, glitazone, sartans, atorvastin and relative nutritional supplements and biologics, might be effective treatment options for this disease [4, 21\u201323].",
