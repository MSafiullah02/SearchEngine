NMDAR1-abs (IgM/IgA/IgG) were measured with cell-based assays from serum obtained within seven days after first-ever stroke. Seropositivity was defined as titers \u22651:10, low titers as \u22641:100 and high titers as >1:100. We assessed cognitive status annually up to three years after stroke with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status -modified (TICS-m) and used crude and adjusted linear mixed models to estimate the impact of NMDAR1-abs exposure on TICS-m over time. Results: Data on NMDAR1-abs (median day of sampling=4[IQR=2-5]) were available in 583 of 621 PROSCIS-B patients (39% female; median NIHSS=2[IQR=1-4]; median MMSE=28[IQR:26-30]; median mRS=2[IQR=1-3]) of whom 76(13%) were seropositive (IgM:n=48/IgA:n=43/IgG:n=2). TICS-m over time was not different in NMDAR1-abs seropositive compared to seronegative patients (\u03b2Crude=0.38[95%CI=-1.00 to 1.76]; adjusted \u03b2Model3=0.30[95%CI=-1.14 to 1.73]). In subgroups, TICS-m over time was not different in patients with low titers (\u03b2Crude=1.53[95%CI=-0.06 to 3.11]; adjusted \u03b2Model3=1.42[95%CI=-0.23 to 3.08]), however, in patients with high titers TICS-m was lower in the crude model (\u03b2=-2.54[95%CI=-4.99 to -0.08]), with a similar effect size after confounder adjustment (\u03b2Model3=-2.30[95%CI=-4.82 to 0.21]).

(3) (4) (5) We previously observed that NMDAR1-abs seropositivity with high titers (>1:100) was associated with unfavorable functional outcome at one year after stroke and overall seropositivity was associated with increased vascular recurrent risk or death within three years after ischemic stroke, (6) contrasting previous findings that indicated beneficial effects of serum NMDAR1-abs on infarct volumes in ischemic stroke. (7, 8) The functionality of IgA and IgM antibodies has been studied previously and remains controversial, especially the clinical implication of these isotypes. (9, 10) Physiological NMDAR function is crucial for mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and normal neuronal function. (11) We consider that serum NMDAR1-abs may enter brain parenchyma following blood brain barrier disruption as a consequence of stroke where they may lead to a downregulation of NMDA-receptors and hamper functional recovery of the damaged tissue.(10) Therefore, this study was motivated by the hypothesis that NMDAR1-abs have detrimental effects on cognitive outcome after stroke. We herewith aimed to quantify the impact of NMDAR1-abs on cognitive functioning up to three years in a large cohort of first-ever ischemic stroke patients.",

Details on the study design have been described previously. (13, 14) For a detailed baseline characterization, an extensive clinical and technical examination was performed within seven days after the acute event including blood sampling for laboratory measures. Patients were followed-up annually by telephone interviews or postal mail contact assessing i.a. cognitive function and functional outcome up to three years after the index event. For this investigation, only patients with mild-to-moderate ischemic stroke events (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] < 16) were included, as we counted very few cases with severe strokes (NIHSS > 15, n=6).",

(9, 10, 20) Similar to our study results, mainly IgM and IgA antibodies were observed. (10) The swift blood sampling in our study and the similar proportion of seropositive patients in healthy individuals suggests that antibodies were preexistent before the stroke and thus not a consequence of the acute event. (20) This is further supported by findings from the study of Zerche et al. who measured NMDAR1-abs in a more standardized time-window swiftly after the stroke (<36h) and measured a similar serum prevalence, using the same determination technique like we used for our study. (7) The high serum prevalence of IgM and IgA NMDAR1-abs in healthy elderly individuals questions a pathological significance of these isotypes on their own. Cumulative evidence from disease cohorts other than stroke patients link serum presentation particularly with cognitive outcomes: for example was NMDAR1-abs IgA and IgM seropositivity associated with cognitive impairment in melanoma patients, and others found serum IgA to be associated with different types of slowly progressive cognitive impairment. (3) (4) (5) In stroke, however, NMDAR1-abs seropositivity was foremost linked with beneficial effects on infarct volumes, which was explained by presumed effects of NMDAR1-abs on NMDA-receptor mediated excitotoxicity. (7, 8, 21) In line with other studies mentioned earlier, (3) (4) (5) in our study of firstever stroke patients high titers were associated with decreased cognitive function, challenging previous hypotheses of beneficial effects of these antibodies in stroke pathology. (7, 8) This current observation further coincides with our observation regarding NMDAR1-abs and other outcomes in the PROSCIS study, i.e. increased vascular risk for overall seropositive patients and unfavorable functional outcome in patients with high titers, after stroke respectively. (6) Considering that NMDARs are highly expressed in the central nervous system and that the blood brain barrier disruption in stroke allows serum NMDAR1-abs to access vulnerable neuronal tissue, it appears reasonable to assume antigen binding of NMDAR1-abs to their targeted receptor and that they subsequently exert functional effects.

We could not observe any associations of NMDAR1-abs serum presentation with low titers and cognitive outcome. If we take into account that only high titers associate with unfavorable functional outcome after stroke, a higher cut-off for seropositivity should be considered. (6) We consider the effects observed for high NMDAR1-abs titers as clinically significant, to -1.05) in the PROSCIS-B study and thus essentially the same effect than the one we observed for NMDAR1-abs seropositivity with high titers on TICS-m, the importance may become clearer. Overall, our Model2 may be the most reliable estimate because we comprehensively adjusted for potential confounders while incorporating only a single parameter, i.e. the propensity score, which prevented over-parametrization of the model.

This is explained by the exclusion of a high proportion of seropositive participants with high titers (see Supplemental Table IV ) and raises the question whether those excluded patients suffered both, i.e. cognitive impairment and depression, or whether pseudodementia due to depression was present in these patients and cognitive decline played a minor role. Our cognitive outcome scores were increasing over time indicated by a precise positive effect size for time in our models (see Supplemental Table I ), which we interpret as a learning effect for TICS-m due to repeated measures. (25) Otherwise, our models seem to accurately pick up on the effects, as demonstrated by single estimates for our prechosen explanatory variables: for example, higher school education (>10 years) caused an increase of 3.57 TICS-m points compared to lower school education (<= 10 years) (Supplemental Table I ), which supports that despite this learning effect our study remains representative.",

We provide all requested items for this instrument in the online supplement (Supplemental Methods I). The first TICS-m assessment was at one year and the last one about three years after stroke. Statistical methods: For our main analyses, we set up linear mixed models (LMM) to estimate the impact of NMDAR1-abs seropositivity on TICS-m over time in comparison to seronegative patients, who acted as the reference group for all analyses in this study. Time in years on a continuous scale and NMDAR1-abs exposure were used as fixed effects in the model equation, whereas individual identification (patient ID) was modelled as random effect. This random intercept mixed model allowed individuals within an exposure group to start from different basic cognitive levels without violating the overall group effect for seropositivity and respective subgroups in comparison to seronegativity on TICS-m scores over time. The estimated effect sizes (\u03b2) for our exposure groups indicate the additional increase or decrease of TICS-m points regarded over the three years.

For the binary exposure status (seropositive vs. seronegative) we built the propensity score with a logistic regression model and for the exposure in ordered subgroups, i.e. seronegative patients, patients with low titers and patients with high titers, we used an ordered logistic regression model.(19) In a third model (Model3) we adjusted for stroke severity (NIHSS in 2 categories: 5-15 vs. 0-4) and stroke etiology classified by the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST)-criteria (1.largeartery atherosclerosis, vs. 2.cardioembolism /3.small vessel occlusion /4.other cause / 5.unknown etiology) in addition to the propensity score. This approach was to evaluate the robustness of our effect estimate after incorporating these attributes. The methodological approach of our sensitivity analyses in which we 1) explored the pattern of missing TICS-m outcome values, 2) applied multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) on missing values and 3) estimated effects after excluding TICS-m outcomes of depressed patients are provided in Supplemental Methods III and Supplemental Methods IV.
