Subsequently, RNA splicing is recognized as an essential nuclear event for mammalian gene expression and for virus multiplication of almost all DNA viruses and some RNA viruses. The majority of mammalian genes consist of multiple segments called exons which separated by noncoding or intervening sequences named introns. Genes which are composed of exons and introns are \"split\" genes. After transcription a nascent or primary transcript (pre-mRNA) contains both exons and introns. The introns are removed from the pre-mRNA by a molecular process called \"RNA splicing\" resulting in production of spliced mature mRNA. RNA splicing takes place both in coding as well as in noncoding primary transcripts. RNA splicing is a posttranscriptional event; however, recent studies showed that it often occurs cotranscriptionally [ 4, 5 ] . Only those transcripts which are fully processed are eventually exportable from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis.",

These cis -elements allow cellular splicing machinery to recognize and remove the intron from pre-mRNA.

            "text": "Diagnostic virology is to identify the etiologic cause of infection from patient's samples. In the past the diagnostic virology relied on three classical techniques to make a diagnosis of viral infection: (a) virus isolation by direct virus cultivation, (b) viral antigen detection, (c) indirect detection of virus-speci fi c antibodies. While being important tools in the diagnostic virology today, these techniques are timeconsuming and require speci fi c tools such as cultivation media, cell or tissue cultures, antibodies, puri fi ed antigens. In the past decade the number of new molecular-based methods grew rapidly and gained more popularity in diagnostic labs. The core of these techniques constitutes of techniques based on nucleic acid detection by speci fi c ampli fi cation, hybridization, and/or sequencing (reviewed in ref. [ 1 ] ). The most nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods are simple, speed, sensitive and speci fi c and thus meet the gold four-S-standard for their application in any diagnostic laboratories. The methods are simple and speed because only a speci fi c primer pair and a PCR machine are needed in a lab setting and identi fi cation of a viral pathogen takes within few hours. They are sensitive and speci fi c and require only a small amount of patients' materials to detect a speci fi c nucleotide sequence region. In general, these techniques can be used to detect almost all types of viral pathogens and even to identify multiple viral pathogens or their variants at the same time. In this chapter we focus on detection of viral RNA splicing as a new tool for diagnostic virology. ). An intron is de fi ned by several speci fi c sequence motifs which allow intron recognition by cellular splicing machinery. A 5 \u00a2 splice site or donor site GU at the intron 5 \u00a2 end is recognized by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), a major component of the cellular splicing machinery. A 3 \u00a2 splice site or acceptor site at the intron 3 \u00a2 end consists of an AG dinucleotide, an upstream polypyrimidine track (PPT) and a further upstream branch point, which are recognized correspondently by U2AF35, U2AF65, and U2 snRNP. These initial recognitions of the intron elements by the components of RNA splicing machinery are essential for spliceosome formation on a pre-mRNA, leading to intron removal. ( b ) RNA splicing is catalyzed by two transesteri fi cation reactions. During RNA splicing the intron ( grey ) between RNA splicing is catalyzed by cellular splicing machinery consisting of several components: small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs, U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and splicing factors. During initial step snRNP U1 and U2 recognized intron sequences at 5 \u00a2 splice site and branch point via complementary base-pairing, along with U2 accessory proteins U2AF65 and U2AF35 association with polypyrimidine track and 3 \u00a2 splice site, respectively ( Fig. 38.1a ) . Intron recognition is a signal for formation of a large protein complex called \"spliceosome\" where intron removal takes place [ 8, 9 ] by two transesteri fi cation reactions (Fig. 38.1b ) . First, the primary transcript is cleaved at the intron 5 \u00a2 end (5 \u00a2 splice site) to leave the upstream exon free and followed by branching of the cleaved intron 5 \u00a2 end to the branch point (usually A) to create a looped structure named \"lariat intermediate.\" In the second step, the hydroxyl group of the free exon attacks the intron 3 \u00a2 splice site leading to the 3 \u00a2 splice site cleavage and lariat formation. Simultaneously, a covalent bound is created between two exons to create a mature mRNA. In general, the lariats are quickly released from the spliceosome and degraded in the nucleus.",

As we described above, the level of conservation of the sequences at splice sites and branch point will affect the strength of binding of core splicing factors and determine the splicing ef fi ciency. RNA splicing is also modulated by a large family of cellular splicing factors containing serine-arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Most of the splicing factors differentially expressed in a speci fi ed tissues and/or a development stage are the RNA-binding proteins which bind to speci fi c RNA cis -element (splicing enhancers or silencers) located within introns and exons [ 10 ] . It is now well documented that splicing factors binding to the cis -elements either increase or decrease RNA splicing ef fi ciency depending on type of splicing factors, positions of the binding sites and overall spliceosome composition [ 11, 12 ] . Current studies showed that beside splicing factors, other processes such as RNA polymerase rate and chromatin structure also affect RNA splicing [ 13, 14 ] .",

            "text": "Although all introns in a pre-mRNA could be constitutively spliced out and all exons are supposedly included in a mature mRNA, there are many cases showing that an RNA splice site may be not selected constitutively, but rather skipped, during RNA splicing. Consequently, this alternative RNA splicing leads to production of RNA isoforms with different exon composition and sizes often resulting in production of different protein isoforms. In general, there are four major classes of alternative RNA splicing ( Fig. 38. 2 ), including exon skipping, intron retention, usage of alternative exons and usage of alternative 5 \u00a2 and alternative 3 \u00a2 splice site [ 15 ] . In addition, alternative promoter or polyadenylation usage can further complicate the alternative RNA splicing. The reason why some of the exons or introns in a pre-mRNA are alternatively spliced is because of the presence of weak or suboptimal splice signals in the RNA or lack of a particular splicing factor in that cell or tissue. It has been noticed that usage of weak splice sites is highly dependent on auxiliary splicing factors binding to the regulatory cis -elements. Since the expression of these factors is variable from cells to cells and from tissues to tissues, alternative RNA splicing is often associated with a speci fi c cell type, tissue, stage of cell differentiation [ 16 ] and results in various isoforms of transcripts from one gene [ 17 ] . Current analysis also revealed that number of genes with alternative RNA splicing increases with complexity of the organism and ranges from 0.05 % in yeast up to 66.8 % in human. Thus, alternative RNA splicing is the driving force behind the complexity of proteome in higher organisms other than total number of the mapped genes.",

First, RNA molecules isolated from samples are separated based on size by electrophoresis in agarose or polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane, the individual RNA transcripts are detected by an antisense probe speci fi c for the detecting RNA. The probes used for the Northern blot are usually labeled with 32 P isotope, enzyme (e.g. alkaline phosphatase), digoxigenin (DIG), or biotin and can be derived from a constitutive exon or an exon-exon junction ( Fig. 38 .3a ). Constitutive exon-based probes would detect all spliced RNA isoforms and the remaining, unspliced pre-mRNA and are recommended when the size difference between spliced RNA isoforms and unspliced pre-mRNA is suf fi cient enough to be separated. If the size difference is too small for two RNA isoforms to be distinguished, an exon junction probe could be used to speci fi cally detect a spliced product. In addition, a speci fi c probe from an alternative exon or intron could be also designed for detection of individual splicing isoforms derived from exon/intron inclusion.",

The protected RNA fragments are separated in the gel by electrophoresis and their sizes are determined by molecular markers. To distinguish a spliced RNA product the probe should contain at least a partial intron region which will be digested from the probe due to lack of the intron sequence in the spliced mRNA. As a result, the protected probe by the corresponding exon regions of the detecting mRNA is shorter and will run faster in the gel ( Fig. 38.3b ). In general, RPA is more sensitive than northern Northern blot in detection of RNA splicing. Both Northern blot and RPA are commonly used in research laboratories. Their advantage is high speci fi city.

A most common approach is the ampli fi cation over the intron regions by a set of primers in fl anking exons. The resulted RT-PCR products vary in sizes depending on how the detecting transcript is spliced. A larger product than predicted size may represent an unspliced pre-mRNA or the contaminating genomic DNA. The later can be determined by a minus RT ampli fi cation (PCR). A spliced mRNA always gives a smaller RT-PCR product than its pre-mRNA due to removal of intron sequences by RNA splicing (Fig. 38.4a ). Another approach is to speci fi cally amplify a spliced product by using an exon junction primer because the sequence at exon-exon junction occurs neither in pre-mRNA nor in genomic DNA. Similarly, a primer based on an alternative exon would amplify only transcript with the inclusion of that exon (Fig. 38.4b ) . After ampli fi cation the size and amount of RT-PCR products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Because of nonlinear nature of PCR ampli fi cation the classical PCR only provides semi-quantitative data on the abundance of various spliced RNA isoforms.",

The principles of different chemistries are described in Fig. 38 .5 . As of today, SYBR green and Taq Man\u2122 probes represent the most common chemistries. SYBR green is a fl uorescent dye which has low fl uorescence when in solution; however, it becomes highly fl uorescent upon binding to double-stranded DNA. On the other hand, Taq Man\u2122 probes, Molecular Beacons and Scorpions probes employ fl uorescence resonance energy transfer or F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET, also known as resonance energy transfer [RET] or electronic energy transfer [EET]) to generate fl uorescent signal. The FRET couples donor fl uorescent dye ( fl uorophore) with non fl uorescent quenching moiety (quencher). When fl uorescent dye is in close proximity of the quencher, the quencher molecule absorbs the energy and thus blocks fl uorescence emission from the fl uorophore when excited by light. TaqMan probes are 18-22 bp oligonucleotide probes which are labeled with a reporter fl uorophore at the 5 \u00a2 end and a quencher at the 3 \u00a2 end and thus in close proximity. Each probe is complementary to a region in the middle of the detecting target between two primers during PCR reaction. When Taq polymerase extends the primer to synthesize the nascent strand, the 5 \u00a2 -3 \u00a2 exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase degrades the Taq Man\u2122 probe annealed to the targeted region and releases the fl uorophore from Taq Man\u2122 probe and thereby breaks the close proximity to the quencher. As a result, the fl uorophore when excited by cycler's light emits fl uorescence which marks the presence of PCR product. The method determines the amount of product by generation of fl uorescent signal, which is measured in \"real time\" during entire length of RT-PCR reaction enabling to calculation of the amount of PCR product after each ampli fi cation cycle. Similarly to Taq Man\u2122 the Molecular Beacon and Scorpions\u2122 use probes to detect speci fi c PCR product. However, instead of probe degradation the signal is generated by physical separation of fl uorophore and quenching moieties after hybridization of speci fi c probe to PCR product during ampli fi cation (Fig. 38.5 ) .",

Intron removal from a pre-mRNA could be detected by RT-PCR based on the size of a product (a) or in a selective ampli fi cation (a and b) . ( a) A pair of primers (Pr1 and Pr2) used for ampli fi cation are derived from two constitutive exons ( black boxes ) over an intron ( solid line ) and the ampli fi ed mRNA product (spliced) will be smaller in size than the products ampli fi ed from template DNA or unspliced pre-mRNA. In an alternative RNA splicing assay, a pair of primes is derived from exon 1 and exon 3 spanning over alternative exon 2 ( grey box ). Alternative RNA splicing will result in multiple spliced RNA products of various sizes ampli fi ed by RT-PCR. (b) Speci fi c ampli fi cation of spliced RNA products during constitutive or alternative RNA splicing. The speci fi c splicing products could be obtained by using a set of primers in which one represents a splicing junction ( Pr1 ). Because of lack of this sequence in unspliced pre-mRNA or DNA, only the spliced product will be selectively ampli fi ed. A selective ampli fi cation could be also used to amplify by RT-PCR a speci fi c RNA isoform derived by alternative RNA splicing by using one primer in an alternative exon (exon 2) in combination with a primer in exon 3. In this case, only the spliced product with exon 2 inclusion will be selectively ampli fi ed by RT-PCR is its binding nonspeci fi cally to any DNA including primer dimers and nonspeci fi c PCR products and is not useful for multiplex ampli fi cation of several products in the same reaction. In contrast, Taq Man\u2122, Molecular Beacons, and Scorpions\u2122 probes speci fi cally detect only a PCR product complementary to probe sequence enabling to distinguish speci fi c from nonspeci fi c products. Disadvantage of these chemistries is that each PCR product requires synthesis of its own speci fi c probe which increases the cost per reaction. On the other hand, labeling individual probes with fl uorophores of different emission spectrum allows multiplexing and simultaneous detection of several products and reduces the cost and labor. The usage of real-time RT-PCR for splicing detection requires special considerations. Since real-time RT-PRC techniques omit electrophoretic separation, the spliced product could not be distinguished based on size. Therefore it is important that only desired product is ampli fi ed. In this case, the usage of SYBR green chemistry is the most challenging because of the lack of speci fi city. Probe-based methods provide higher speci fi city due to probe hybridization to selected sequences which are not present in nonspeci fi c products. To detect only desired spliced product the probe and primer should be complementary to a speci fi c exon-exon junction or alternatively spliced region. Several other factors must be considered when using RT-PCRbased techniques in diagnostics including RNA sample quality and preparation, Taq polymerase inactivating contaminants in clinical samples, and ampli fi cation bias. Other considerations are false positivity and PCR cross-contamination.",

In tiling arrays the set of overlapping probes cover the full-length of nascent primary transcript including exons and introns. The analysis of fl orescence for each probe allows to identify exons and introns based on the difference in signal intensity ( Fig. 38 .6b i ). The advantage of tiling arrays is their ability to identify known as well as new splice events. Therefore, the tilling arrays are often used as discovery tools. The disadvantages are . When bound to unspliced transcript the binding sites of two probes are separated by intron preventing energy transfer by FRET and thus, no signal is generated. After intron removal by RNA splicing, two probes are bought to close proximity for FRET to occur. The energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor leads to excitation of the acceptor fl uorophore (A in circle with spikes ) and generation of detectable signal. The diagram is modi fi ed from Blanco and Artero [ 31 ] requirement of large amount of probes and are time-consuming data analysis. The exon arrays are more commonly used but require the knowledge of splicing events. Several types of probes hybridizing to fl anking exons, intron, and exon-exon junctions are designed to detect each splicing event ( Fig. 38.6b ii ). The fl uorescence intensity is detected for each probe and mathematical model is applied to determine the occurrence of splicing event.

There are two major types of tissue sections: frozen and formalin-fi xed, paraf fi n-embedded (FFPE). Both are routinely used for detection of viral antigens by various types of staining, but their use in detection of nucleic acids including spliced transcripts is still rather rare. Improved sensitivity of current nucleic acid isolation and ampli fi cation techniques allows the recovery of nucleic acid from tissue sections for further analysis by PCR and RT-PCR with selective isolation of only cells of interest by laser capture microdissection to bring additional level of speci fi city [ 23, 24 ] . However, detection of nucleic acids by in situ hybridization (ISH) directly on tissue sections can provide additional bene fi ts about gene expression linked with spatial distribution of speci fi c RNA transcripts at cellular and often even at subcellular level. In the past the nucleic acid molecules including RNA transcripts by ISH were detected by DNA probes labeled with radioisotope ( 35 S, 33 P, 3 H) [ 25 ] , which were later replaced by nonradioactive DNA-probes labeled with biotin or digoxigenin and detected by chromogenic methods using enzymes-labeled antibodies (CISH) [ 26 ] . Labeling probes speci fi c for different transcripts with different fl uorophores (FISH) allow detection of multiple targets at the same tissue section. However, the sensitivity was always a limiting factor of ISH techniques. This was caused mainly by usage of DNA probes which suffer from low af fi nity to complementary RNA targets and sensitivity to degradation of RNA-DNA hybrids by RNase H. Development of tyramide signal ampli fi cation (TSA) has dramatically improved the sensitivity of DNA probes [ 27 ] . Further improvement came from by introduction of locked nucleic acids (LNA) and peptide nucleic acids (PNA) probes with high af fi nity to RNA molecules and resistance to RNase H degradation [28] [29] [30] . Detection of RNA splicing by ISH requires a probe to speci fi cally bind only to spliced mRNA without binding to unspliced pre-mRNA or genomic DNA in the sample. Historically this was achieved by designing a probe over exonexon junction containing sequences present only in spliced transcripts ( Fig. 38 .6c i ).",

In principle, each splicing event is monitored by a set of two probes complementary to exonic sequences fl anking an intron region. One of two probes carries a fl uorophore acceptor while the second probe is labeled by fl uorophore donor. When probes bind to genomic DNA or unspliced nascent transcript their binding sites are separated by intron regions resulting in distance between donor and acceptor too big for two fl uorophores to engage in FRET. However, intron removal by splicing brings probe binding sites to proximity close enough for FRET to occur resulting in generation of measurable fl uorescence [ 31 ] (Fig. 38.6c ii ). This results in high speci fi city and low background. Using a set of probes with different fl uorophores allows to detect multiple spliced transcripts or various spliced isoforms of the transcript. In summary, ISH hybridization methods provide us with a necessary tool to investigate the distribution not only of protein-encoding transcripts but also of rapidly growing number of virus-encoded noncoding RNAs, of which their role in viral pathogenesis remains often elusive [ 32 ] . In situ hybridization methods could be especially suitable in retrospective analysis of archived samples in collections.",

While detection of viral genomes in clinical samples would indicate virus infection, the result does not provide information about the stage and dynamic of virus infection. In many cases the progress of viral replication could be assumed from changes in viral load, but this approach requires multiple sampling in the course of infection and varies between individuals. One major advantage for detection of spliced viral transcripts is that viral RNA splicing re fl ects viral gene expression and thus active viral infection, providing important information about the status of infection without requiring multiple sampling. The production of viral transcripts and their RNA splicing are often the fi rst sign of virus replication detectable before the increase of viral load or occurrence of viral-speci fi c antigens or antibodies. Therefore the detection of active viral infection by RNA splicing may be especially important for the early viral diagnosis of the infection critical for successful treatment. Because of direct association of spliced viral transcripts with the level of active viral replication and by monitoring viral RNA one could provide essential information earlier enough for initiation of antiviral therapy. A rapid shut-off of viral transcription and RNA splicing could be also the fi rst sign of the blockage of viral replication visible even before the change in viral load by genome copy numbers. In the case of ubiquitous viruses, such as members of herpesvirus or parvovirus family, which establish latent infection in the host, detection of RNA splicing of a viral early gene would assist to distinguish viral latent infection from active infection. Such a diagnosis is critical for recipients of the transplant organs where reactivation of latent viruses often leads to transplant rejection.",

The fi rst group represents an unspliced 9-kb transcript which serves a template for The second group represents single spliced RNA transcripts in size of ~4-kb which encode env , vif , vpr , and vpu proteins. The third group in size of ~2-kb consists of multiple spliced RNA transcripts to encode accessory proteins tat , rev , nef , and vpr . During virus infection, HIV generates such a wide variety of RNA transcripts by usage of at least fi ve alternative 5 \u00a2 splice sites and 8-9 alternative 3 \u00a2 splice sites [ 50, 51 ] ( Fig. 38.8b ). In addition, several antisense transcripts initiating from several 3 \u00a2 long terminal repeats (3 \u00a2 LTR) were also detected in HIV-1-infected cells [ 52 ] . Recent studies showed that HIV RNA splicing is largely regulated by viral RNA cis -elements and cellular splicing factors and is orchestrated for completion of HIV life cycle in the course of virus infection. Multiple spliced transcripts of 2-kb family are expressed in the early stage of virus infection to express tat , rev and nef. This group of spliced RNAs is produced by using 3 \u00a2 splice site A3-A5 located in the central part of the viral genome with A3 site for expression of tat , A4a-c for rev , and A5 for nef proteins. During late stage of HIV infection, nuclear import and accumulation of tat together with rev protein allows the rev protein bind to a rev-responsive element (RRE) in partially spliced 4-kb and unspliced 9-kb RNA transcripts located in tat/rev intron between D4 and A7 splice sites to mediate the later transcripts export into the cytoplasm for translation [ 53 ] (Fig. 38.8c ) . Sites A1A and D1A are involved in pre-mRNA stability [ 54 ] . Strains from IIIB family of HIV viruses use additional A6 and D5 to generate small exon in env region and the transcripts containing this exon express tripartite tat-env-rev fusion protein, tev [ 55, 56 ] .",

HBV encodes four viral proteins: core (C), reverse transcriptase-polymerase (P), surface (S) and X-protein (Fig. 38.11a ) . In infected hepatocytes viral DNA is converted to cccDNA (covalently closed circular DNA) and serves as a template for expression of viral pregenomic (pgRNA) and three subgenomic RNAs from several promoters. Despite the presence of several promoters, all transcripts used the same poly A signal for transcription termination (Fig. 38.11b ) . The core protein C and polymerase-transcriptase protein P are encoded by a bicistronic pgRNA. Subgenomic preS and S RNAs translate three surface antigens (large [preS1], middle [preS2], and small [S] surface antigens).

            "text": "All AAV genomes consist of two open reading frames, Rep and Cap , with Rep for virus replication and Cap for structural capsid protein. AAVs use several different strategies to produce viral products. First group represents AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, and AAV6 and their viral transcripts originate from one of three viral promoters on the left hand side of viral genome and are terminated on a single polyadenylation site on the right hand side of the genome. The middle part of the transcripts contains a ~300-nt long intron with a nonconsensus 5 \u00a2 splice site and two 3 \u00a2 splice sites (Fig. 38.12a ) .The ef fi cient splicing requires the presence of both helper virus and large Rep protein [ 98 ] . While Rep protein seems to be essential for AAV2 splicing, several adenovirus proteins (E1A, E1B, E2a, E4 or f6, and VA RNA) as well as some products of herpes simplex virus (UL5, UL8, UL52, and UL29) have stimulatory effect on AAV2 splicing [ 99 ] . AAV5 and some animal AAVs are in the second group which utilizes three upstream promoters for their transcription, but their genome contains additional polyadenylation sites in the intron region. Transcripts from two upstream promoters are polyadenylated on the internal polyA site, whereas spliced transcripts from P41 promoter use a poly A site at the right side of the genome (Fig. 38.12b ) . The only spliced transcript in AAV5 infections is the Cap transcript which contains a smaller (~240-nt) intron. Interestingly, the splicing of AAV5 Cap transcript is constitutive and highly ef fi cient even in the absence of helper virus infection [ 100 ] . Human B19 virus, member of Erythrovirus genus, was fi rst identi fi ed in the serum of blood donor [ 101 ] . Three of B19 viruses have been identi fi ed from different geographic regions [ 102 ] . After acute infection the virus persists in host for the rest of the life. The infection by B19 virus is in general asymptomatic, but several pathological conditions are associated with B19 infection and these include erythema infectiosum (the \" fi fth disease\") [ 103 ] , polyarthropathy syndrome [ 104 ] , transient aplastic crisis (TAC) [ 105 ] , and persistent anemia/pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). B19 infection during pregnancy may associate with spontaneous miscarriage and development of nonimmune hydrops fetalis [ 106 ] .",

NS1 ORF on the left-side genome translates a 77-kDa nonstructural protein and a VP ORF on the right-side genome produces two capsid proteins (84-kDa VP1 and 58-kDa VP2). At least nine virus-speci fi c transcripts have been detected following B19 infection [ 107 ] which are all transcribed solely from a single promoter P6 located upstream of NS1 gene, but are alternatively spliced and terminated at two alternative polyadenylation sites (Fig. 38.12c ) either in the middle or on the far rightside of the genome. By using the poly (A) site in the middle of virus genome, the P6 transcript has an intron in the NS1 ORF and splicing of this intron from NS1 transcript may create a novel ORF to encode a small accessory 7.5-kDa protein. However, if the poly (A) site on the right-side genome is used for RNA polyadenylation, the P6 transcript become a bicistronic (NS1 and VP) transcript with two introns. By splicing to remove the intron 1 from the bicistronic RNA, the single-spliced P6 transcript is capable to encode both 7.5-kDa and VP1 proteins. Double RNA splicing to remove both intron 1 and intron 2 from the P6 bicistronic transcript disrupts both ORFs for NS1 and VP1, but creates a VP2 or a novel ORF for another accessory 11-kDa protein, depending on which alternative 3 \u00a2 splice site being selected (Fig. 38.12c ) . Thus, all detected B19 transcripts are derived from a P6 pre-mRNA containing one or two introns with two alternative 3 \u00a2 splice site, depending on the selection of which one of two alternative poly A sites, and are alternatively spliced RNA transcripts, except the unspliced full-length NS1RNA. The cis -elements in the central exon and intron 2 are regulatory elements to control the alternative P6 RNA splicing, with the double spliced P6 RNAs being the predominant species in the infected cells [ 107 ] .",

The Polyomaviridae family contains only one genus Polyomavirus ( PyV ) which has nine members of human polyomaviruses: BKPyV [ 116 ] , JCPyV [ 117 ] , KI PyV [ 118 ] , WU PyV [ 119 ] , Merkel cell PyV (MCPyV) [ 120 ] , HPyV6, HPyV7 [ 121 ] , trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated PyV (TSV) [ 122 ] , and most recently discovered HPyV9 [ 123 ] . Simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40), a prototype virus of the family, was introduced into human population as a contaminant in early trials of poliovirus vaccine [ 124 ] . Serological data indicate that polyomavirus infection is widespread in general human population with initial infection occurring in childhood [ 125 ] . After infection polyomaviruses persist in host for the rest of the life. While initial infection is mostly asymptomatic, several human polyomaviruses are associated with various pathological conditions in immunocompromised patients including nephropathy and cystitis associated with BK PyV and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with JC PyV [ 126 ] , or trichodysplasia spinulosa presumably associated with TSV infection. Polyomaviruses express an oncoprotein T antigen and may lead to development of human cancer by abortive infection as has recently been con fi rmed in a rare but aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma [127] [128] [129] .",

The primary transcript of T antigen contains two introns, but its intron 1 has two alternative 5 \u00a2 splice sites. During RNA splicing, the intron 2 retention is important for production of both large T and small t antigens. However, selection of a proximal 5 \u00a2 splice site in the intron 1 for RNA splicing leads to production of large T antigen, whereas selection of a distal 5 \u00a2 splice site in the intron 1 results in small t production. Because the sequence region between the proximal 5 \u00a2 splice site and the distal 5 \u00a2 splice site has a stop codon, retention of this region in small t RNA splicing makes the small t RNA larger than the large T RNA, but introduction of a premature stop codon in the small t RNA results in production of a smaller protein (Fig. 38.14b ) . In addition, a rare tiny-t antigen in size of ~17-kDa has been attributed to double RNA splicing in SV40-infected cells [ 130 ] . In this case, the transcript encoding the 17-kDa antigen shows splicing of both introns, but splicing of the intron 1 by selection of the proximal 5 \u00a2 ss. Similar to SV40, the multiple-spliced RNA species of early transcripts were detected also in other polyomaviruses such as truncated T-antigen (truncTAg) in BKPyV [ 131 ] , T \u00a2 135, T \u00a2 136 and T \u00a2 165 in JCPyV [ 132 ] and T3 and T4 early transcripts in MCPyV [ 127 ] (Fig. 38.14b ) .

            "text": "Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of small DNA tumor viruses and has a genome in size of ~8-kb surrounded by a viral capsid. HPV genome consists of three regions: viral early, late, and noncoding regions and in general encodes eight viral genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, E7, L1, and L2). Viral early gene products are regulatory proteins responsible for virus multiplication and pathogenesis during a productive infection, whereas L1 and L2 genes encode two viral capsid proteins for virus particle formation. Interestingly, almost all viral early genes are expressed from an early promoter upstream of viral E6 gene and are polyadenylated at an early poly (A) signal downstream of E5 gene. Thus, viral early gene transcripts are polycistronic, with several ORFs in a single RNA molecule, and undergo extensive alternative RNA splicing during viral RNA maturation. In contrast, viral L1 and L2 are commonly transcribed from E7 ORF and polyadenylated at a late poly (A) site downstream of L1 ORF (Fig. 38.15a ) . As a result, the 5 \u00a2 sequences of viral L1 and L2 are part of the viral early transcript sequences. RNA splicing to removal the most of these early gene sequences from the RNA by RNA splicing is important for viral L1 and L2 expression [ 133 ] . HPVs are the etiological agent of cervical cancer and presumably of other anogenital cancers. HPV is present in >95 % of all cervical cancer and is required for initiation of cervical carcinogenesis and maintenance of the cervical cancer cells. Cervical cancer is a leading cause for women death in the developing world, with about 493,000 new cases and nearly 273,000 deaths each year ( www.who.int/hpvcentre ). More than 120 genotypes of HPVs have been identi fi ed to date and are grouped into two major groups according to their pathogenesis and association with cervical cancer [ 134 ] . The high-risk or oncogenic HPV types are present in cervical cancers, whereas low-risk or nononcogenic HPVs are not found in cervical or other anogenital cancers [ 135 ] . In general, women acquire HPV infection by sexual contact. Various epidemiology studies indicate that women with repeat exposure to oncogenic HPVs and with persistent cervical infection of oncogenic HPVs are in high risk to develop cervical cancer [ 136, 137 ] . Infection with oncogenic HPV-16 and HPV-18, two most common oncogenic HPV types, leads to development of almost 70 % of all cervical and other anogenital cancers. Viral E6 and E7 of oncogenic HPVs are two viral oncoproteins that inactivate, respectively, cellular p53 and pRB, two tumor suppressor proteins essential for cell cycle control [ 138, 139 ] . In cervical cancer tissues and cervical cancer-derived cell lines, E6 and E7 oncogenes are highly expressed and majority of the E6/E7 bicistronic RNA are alternatively spliced as diagramed for HPV-16 and HPV-18 (Fig. 38.15b ) . A major spliced RNA isoform of viral E6/E7 bicistronic RNA is E6*I derived from splicing of nt 226 5 \u00a2 splice site to nt 409 3 \u00a2 splice site for HPV-16 and of nt 233 5 \u00a2 splice site to nt 416 3 \u00a2 splice site for HPV-18 ( Fig. 38.15b ). It has been demonstrated that this RNA splicing is necessary for viral E7 translation [ 140 ] and can be easily detected by RNase protection assay (RPA) or RT-PCR methods [ 140, 141 ] . The presence of high-grade premalignant lesions (CIN, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) caused by oncogenic HPV infection is a sign of increased risk of developing cervical cancer. These lesions can be detected by routine cervical examination and treated by surgery to prevent progression to cervical cancer. Papanicolaou test (also called Pap smear) is a screening test used in gynecology to detect premalignant and malignant cells in cervical swabs. A woman who has Pap smear with abnormal cells may also be referred for HPV DNA testing by two FDA-approved assays: Hybrid Capture 2 DNA test to detect 13 high-risk HPVs (HPV- 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) from Qiagen [ 142 ] or Cobas 4800 System to detect 14 high-risk HPVs (HPV- 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) from Roche [ 143 ] . More recently, a few of HPV E6/E7 RNA tests have been introduced. APTIMA HPV Assay from Gen-Probe was designed to detect HPV E6/ E7 mRNA from 14 high-risk types (HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59, -66, and -68) [ 144 ] with a sensitivity and speci fi city similar to or better than Hybrid Capture 2 DNA test [ 145, 146 ] . PreTect HPV-Proofer from NorChip was designed to detect E6 and E7 RNA from HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45 [ 147, 148 ] , with more speci fi c than HC2 in identifying women with CIN 2+ but has a lower sensitivity [ 149 ] . By using the primers detailed in Fig. 38 .15c for RT-PCR assays, the spliced E6/E7 RNAs of HPV-16 and HPV-18 can be detected easily based on the amplicon size smaller than E6/E7 DNA, without worry of carryover viral DNA contamination encountered by HPV DNA tests.",

Lytic infection is associated with viral genome replication and production of infectious virions and generally leads to destruction of infected cell. In contrast to latent infection almost all of viral lytic genes in viral lytic infection are expressed in timely regulated fashion and are divided, based on their dependence on viral protein expression and viral genome replication, into three kinetic classes: immediate early, early, and late. At some circumstances the virus in latently infected cells may be reactivated and proceeded to lytic infection. The mechanisms controlling the establishment of latency and reactivation of herpesviruses are not fully understood.

Primary infection often occurs at epithelia, the point of entry, followed by establishment of latent infection generally in a specialized cell type (neurons or lymphocytes) which serves as a virus reservoir. Recurrence of infection is caused by virus reactivation from latency when virus escapes from host immunological surveillance. Overall symptoms of herpesvirus infections in healthy individuals are generally mild, but may be life threatening in immunocompromised patients. While infections of some herpesviruses such as EBV and KSHV are clearly etiologically linked to the development of several types of cancer, the role of other human herpesviruses in cell transformation remains unknown [ 153 ] .

Genital infection with HSV-2 causes genital herpes which is considered as a sexually transmitted disease. HSV-2 is also neurotropic and establishes latent infection in sacral ganglia. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are two closely related viruses with a similar genome and gene structures including their LAT and ICP0 regions [ 168 ] . In general the infection of HSV-1 and -2 is controlled by host immune system. Thus initial or recurrent infections are associated with only mild symptoms. Infection in immunocompromised patients could cause several severe diseases including encephalitis [ 169 ] . Genital infections or reactivation of HSV-2 during pregnancy could lead to congenital infection [ 170 ] . Detection of viral DNA may not provide suf fi cient information about virus replication status due to the permanent presence of viral DNA in the infected cells. Detection viral lytic products, such as spliced ICP0 RNA, may be a better predictor of virus reactivation even before occurrence of clinical symptoms for early diagnosis enabling of early treatment. Disappearance of the detectable lytic products could be a sign of treatment ef fi ciency since the viral transcripts disappear earlier than viral DNA.",

While primary infection during childhood is unremarkable, the virus acquisition in adolescence and adulthood is often associated with the development of infectious mononucleosis. In healthy individuals the EBV infection is well controlled by immune system. However, EBV remains in long-living memory B cells where it establishes a latent infection. EBV is an oncogenic virus capable to transform the infected B cells [ 183 ] . EBV infections have been associated with the development of several human malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, gastric carcinoma, and others (see review ref.

During latent infection, EBV expresses six nuclear antigens (EBNAs-1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, and -LP), three latent membrane proteins (LMPs-1, -2A, and -2B) and several noncoding transcripts (EBERs-1 and -2 and BARTs).

Although BRLF1 and BZLF1 are transcribed separately from a different promoter with the Rp for BRLF1 and the Zp for BZLF1, both gene transcripts utilize the same polyadenylation site for RNA polyadenylation [ 195 ] (Fig. 38.17c ) . Thus, the Zp promoter transcript is a monocistronic ZEBRA RNA containing two constitutive introns and splicing of these two introns results in production of a 0.9-kb mRNA to encode ZEBRA protein. Transcription from the Rp promoter leads to produce a 3.8-kb bicistronic transcript, ZEBRA/RTA, which contains two additional introns over the ZEBRA RNA. Splicing of the intron 1 in the 5 \u00a2 noncoding region of ZEBRA/RTA transcript leads to production of a 2.9-kb RNA as a major RNA isoform. However, both isoforms of ZEBRA/RTA RNA have a potential to encode ZEBRA and RTA proteins. A third, minor isoform of ZEBRA/RTA transcript is derived from splicing of additional internal intron spanning over BRLF1 ORF to BZLF1 ORF and this splicing produces a RAZ transcript in size of ~0.9-kb to encode a RTA-ZEBRA fusion protein, RAZ. RAZ may function as an inhibitor to ZEBRA during EBV infection [ 196 ] .",

The gene ORF73 posits along with ORF72 and K13 in a larger latent locus of the virus genome. The latter two genes encode viral homologues of cellular proteins vCyclin (ORF72) and vFLICE (K13). ORF73/72/K13 are transcribed from a single promoter (P 127880 ) as a tricistronic RNA which has an intron containing two alternative 3 \u00a2 splice site. Alternative RNA splicing and alternative A detailed EBNA-1 transcript derived from the Q p promoter is shown below with splice sites ( black triangles ) and splice directions ( dashed lines for introns). A primer pair used to detect the spliced EBNA1 transcript from exon U to exon K [ 185 ] are detailed in the table below. (c) Gene structures of BRLF1 (RTA) and BZLF1 (ZEBRA) (two EBV-immediate early genes) and their spliced RNA products. EBV RTA and ZEBRA are transcribed by two alternative promoters, R P and Z P , but polyadenylated by using the same polyadenylation signal downstream of ZEBRA ORF. Thus, the bicistronic RTA transcript derived from Rp promoter contains multiple introns and has potentials to encode RTA, ZEBRA, and RAZ proteins by alternative RNA splicing, whereas the monocistronic ZEBRA transcript derived from the Zp promoter encodes only ZEBRA protein and also contains multiple introns as detailed further below with nucleotide positions of splice sites, exons (Z1-Z3, black boxes ) and introns ( dashed lines ). Arrows below exons Z1 and Z3 are a primer pair used for detection of spliced ZEBRA mRNA [ 185 ] and detailed in the RNA polyadenylation of the tricistronic pre-mRNA results in production of three mature mRNAs (5.4-, 3.3-, and 1.7-kb) [ 202 ] (Fig. 38.18b ) . The 5.4-kb transcript most likely for LANA-1 expression is produced by usage of the proximal 3 \u00a2 splice site, whereas usage of the distal 3 \u00a2 splice site leads to express the 1.7-kb transcript for vCyclin and vFLICE. Both transcripts are polyadenylated at the same distal polyadenylation site. The minor 3.3-kb transcript use the proximal splice site for RNA splicing, but is polyadenylated at a proximal noncanonical polyadenylation signal (Fig. 38.18b ) . KSHV lytic replication is controlled by a major viral transactivator, ORF50 (also referred as Rta) [ 203, 204 ] . Similarly to LANA1, ORF50 posits along with K8 and K8.1 in a larger gene locus (ORF50/K8/K8.1 cluster) (Fig. 38.18c ) and is expressed as an immediately early transcript during lytic virus replication. K8 encoding a viral k-bZIP protein is an early gene and K8.1 encoding a glycoprotein is a late gene. Although each of the three genes bears its own promoter, all of their RNA transcripts use a single polyadenylation site located downstream of K8.1 gene and undergo alternative RNA splicing (see review ref. [ 154 ] ). Thus, the 3 \u00a2 portion of ORF50 transcript is homologous to K8 and K8.1 and has the same intron and exon structures as seen in K8 and K8.1 transcripts. The ORF50 transcript is tricistronic, K8 is bicistronic, and K8.1 is monocistronic in nature. The bicistronic K8 full transcript composes of four exons separated by three introns (Fig. 38.18c ) . A functional K8 a protein is expressed from a fully spliced mRNA, but retention of the intron 2 in K8 b mRNA results in the expression of a minor form K8 b protein [ 205 ] . An unspliced K8 RNA, K8 g , is also detectable, but rare in lytically infected cells.",

In the fi rst part, we provided basic information about the mechanisms of RNA splicing and methodological approaches of speci fi c detection of spliced RNA molecules. The core of these techniques represents an ampli fi cation and detection of nucleic acids. The advantage of nucleic acid-based techniques is the application of the same platform for detection various viral pathogens often in the same time by multiplexing. The rapid setup of these methods is especially important for quick response to emerging viruses as has recently been proven in the case of SARS and avian fl u pandemic, when nucleic acid ampli fi cation was rapidly employed to detect and to con fi rm the infection. The less material requirement and simplicity make these detection methods suitable for applications in low resources setting such laboratories of the fi rst contact and fi eld laboratories.

In addition, we have provided examples of each virus where the detection of spliced viral RNA could bring additional bene fi t to current techniques to improve the disease prognosis or better monitoring of ef fi ciency of therapeutic intervention. We believe that systematic study of RNA splicing events during viral infection could lead to better viral diagnosis, better therapy management, and eventually leading to our better understanding of pathogenesis of human viral pathogens.",
