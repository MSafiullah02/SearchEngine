Because newborn family members and neonatal intensive care unit staff were asymptomatic before, during or after the episode, nasopharyngeal swabs could not be obtained from the contacts. Other infectious causes of pericardial effusion were incompatible with the clinical picture: the patient was not treated with drugs that may had caused pericardial effusion, there was no possible traumatic cause (central venous catheter perforation and penetrating trauma), and there were not clinical, analytical, or radiological signs of other causes (tuberculosis, fungal infections, collagen diseases, etc.). Blood culture for other microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, was negative. Because of this, PIV3 may have been the trigger for the pericardial pathology.",

Postmortem evaluation confirmed the presence of the pathogen in the lung, brain, and pericardial samples [1]. The second case is a 9-year-old immunocompetent patient with pericardial effusion in whom parainfluenza 4 was isolated in nasopharyngeal aspirate. The patient was successfully treated with ibuprofen [2]. There are two other cases reported in adults. In the first one, parainfluenza 3 viral infection was considered to be the cause of a fulminant myocarditis with pericardial effusion in a 35-year-old woman with diabetic ketoacidosis and type 1 diabetes [3]. The second one described a 62-year-old woman with pneumonia and pericardial effusion as a result of infection with parainfluenza virus type 4 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [4].",

It is a prevailing cause of viral respiratory infection in the pediatric population after respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, or human metapneumovirus. Although respiratory viral infections are usual among hospitalized newborns, they are not clinically suspected because the signs and symptoms of infection are nonspecific or too subtle. For this reason, they are seldom diagnosed in the neonatal intensive care unit. There are scarce reports presenting isolated cases like this one as most of the published data refer to neonatal intensive care unit microepidemics in which parainfluenza 3 was just one of the different viruses detected [5]. Those outbreaks are thought to be related to longer stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. As the main route of transmission of this pathogen is through infected secretions, respiratory and contact isolation is essential to prevent disease outbreaks.",

Clinical signs are nonspecific (mainly respiratory with increased secretions, respiratory distress, coughing, tachypnea, pneumonia, or apnea episodes). Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion in the presence of suggestive symptoms, since other infecting viruses such as respiratory syncytial viruses, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, or coronaviruses may induce similar clinical pictures confirmation. Diagnosis is based on the detection of virus-specific RNA using nucleic acid amplification techniques from a respiratory sample such as a nasopharyngeal swab. This technique has been a breakthrough in the diagnosis as it could decrease unnecessary use of empirical antibiotic therapy. Other diagnostic methods are viral culture, usually less available and with longer turnaround time results, and direct viral detection in respiratory secretions by immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassay, which shows lower sensitivity and specificity than PCR. Currently, there is no specific treatment against parainfluenza virus infections. Management of the infected patient is based on supportive therapy according to the clinical condition.",
