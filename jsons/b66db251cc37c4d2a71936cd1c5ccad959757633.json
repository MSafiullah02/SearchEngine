The common AML subtype in the elderly shares characteristics with AML that follows MDS, Fanconi's anemia, alkylating agent chemotherapy (see also Sect. \"Etiology\" below), and an estimated 10-15% of AML in younger patients. It has been referred to as MDS-related AML and is characterized by common cytogenetic abnormalities shared with MDS, and frequent multilineage dysplastic morphology in the residual hematopoietic precursor cells. A higher frequency of unfavorable biologic and prognostic factors, rather than age per se, is thus the major determinant for the inferior prognosis for elderly patients. By contrast, AML with genotypes typical of younger patients, which may be considered as true de novo AML, has an approximately constant incidence throughout lifetime, also in progressive age groups. Five percent of elderly patients with AML are estimated to belong to the true de novo AML-group, which shows consistency with the incidence in younger patients [13] .",

The differences in survival results seen among various trials using similar chemotherapy may be explained by the prevalence of negative prognostic characteristics within a study population [31] . To understand clinical features and outcomes of that significant number of patients not meeting inclusion criteria for clinical studies, population-based evaluations have found increasing attention. Some results on age distribution, treatment decisions, remission rates, and survival in AML do show quite significant variability to some of the large clinical investigations. In one report, of a total of 170 AML patients, 55% were treated outside a study protocol. Nonstudy patients differed significantly from patients included in clinical trials with respect to age and performance status at clinical presentation, comorbidity, and type of AML. Patients who participated in a clinical trial had a median age of 46 years (16-73 years), whereas those not included were significantly older (median age 63 years; 21-83 years). Survival was significantly better in patients treated in a clinical protocol (median OS: 15 vs. 3.4 months) [25] . For survival results in population-based studies see Table 3 .1. It can be assumed that 50 Chapter 3 \u00b7 Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Epidemiology and Etiology part of the increase in median survival in the last years may be attributed to improved supportive care over past decades.",

Depending on the treatment modality (chemotherapy only; combined chemo-, radiotherapy; or combined chemo-, radiotherapy with consecutive bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation), endocrine abnormalities, cataracts, cardiac abnormalities, academic difficulties, and secondary malignancies resulted in 14-51%. Besides physical late effects, psychosocial complications were observed in long-term survivors [32] . Patients that survived AML and treatment have also been monitored in a long-term follow-up at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center [33] .

Other inherited diseases associated with AML include Klinefelter's syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome [41] , Fanconi anemia, and neurofibromatosis [9] . Furthermore, risk factors for developing AML in children were identified and include race/ethnicity, the father's age at time of conception, and time since the mother's last live birth [35] . Specifically, Asian/Pacific Islander children had a higher risk than non-Hispanic white infants; children born to fathers older than 35, compared to those aged 20-34, had an increased risk; and longer time since the last live birth (at least 7 years) resulted in an increased risk. In this context, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has been investigated in more detail. Representing an example of a unique AML subtype (FAB M3) with a characteristic morphology associated with distinct chromosomal and gene-rearrangement aberrations, it has been shown to also have separate epidemiological features. For yet unknown reasons, an increased incidence of APL has been recognized in adult patients originating in Latin America and in children in Southern Europe. Of interest, the APL-specific gene rearrangement is different in patients of Latin American decent, with the majority of breakpoints in the RARa gene in the PML/RARa transcript in intron 6 (called bcr 1). It is therefore speculated that this particular breakpoint site may be determined genetically [42] [43] [44] [45] .",

It describes the cooperativity of activating mutations in FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) (= class I) and gene rearrangements involving hematopoietic transcription factors (=class II). The expression of both classes may result in the AML phenotype. FLT3 mutations can appear in all subtypes of AML and with the majority of known chromosomal translocations associated with AML. In this hypothesis, FLT3 mutations serve as exemplary of class I mutations that, alone, confer a proliferative and survival advantage to hematopoietic progenitors but do not affect cell differentiation. Further examples of class I mutations are activating mutations in N-RAS or K-RAS in AML. In contrast, class II mutations would be exemplified by AML1/ETO, CBFb/ SMMHC, PML/RARa, and MLL-related fusion genes. They appear to impair hematopoietic differentiation, but are not solely sufficient to cause leukemia. This new hypothesis may have important implications to novel treatment approaches (e.g., molecular targeting of both, FLT-3 and fusion proteins) [58] .",

The development of secondary AML shows a maximum in the 5-10 years following therapy. The distinct pattern of cytogenetic and genetic abnormalities in secondary or treatment-related AML is worthy of notice [78] . AML arises after previous therapy for other malignancies in a subset of 10-20% of patients. The risk of therapy-related AML after intensive chemotherapy may be increased to more than 100 times [79] .",
