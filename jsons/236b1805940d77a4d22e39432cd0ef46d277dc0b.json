NK cells are known to act as a first line to control many viral infections such as herpes simplex virus type 1, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6 and murine cytomegalovirus. 2, 3 However, human hepatitis C virus has developed strategies to evade the detection and elimination by NK cells, 4 as is also suggested by the increased numbers of NK cells in the livers of patients during the immunotolerance phase of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. 5 The liver is enriched in NK and NKT cells, which play major roles in the control of viral hepatitis infections by limiting viral replication via an IFN-c-dependent mechanism. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the importance of the cytotoxic activities of NK cells in preventing the establishment of chronic human hepatitis C virus infections. 6, 7 Natural killer cells are rapidly recruited from the bone marrow and spleen during viral infections. 8 Interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, IL-18 and IFN-c enhance the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and further increase the production of IFN-c by these cells. 1, 2 Moreover, the production of IFN-c by NK cells stimulated with IL-12 and IL-18 is dependent on the activation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and is regulated through the p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 mitogenactivated protein kinase (ERK-1/2 MAPK) pathways. 9, 10 However, little is known about the mechanism involved in the efficient production of antiviral IFN-c by intrahepatic NK cells during the acute phase of viral hepatitis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 250, "end": 251, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 531, "end": 533, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 534, "end": 535, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 646, "end": 647, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 805, "end": 806, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1162, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1164, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1266, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1420, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1422, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1733, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1736, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an excellent model for studying the immunological disorders associated with viral", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The production of interferon-c (IFN-c) by infiltrating natural killer (NK) cells in liver is involved in the control of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection.

Ex vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that NK cells, expressing carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM) 1a (the MHV receptor), can produce a higher level of IFN-c in the presence of both L2-MHV3 and interleukin-12 (IL-12)/IL-18.

The synergistic IFN-c production involves the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) rather than the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 MAPK signalling pathway. However, the signal triggered through the engagement of CEACAM1a decreases the production of IFN-c, when these molecules are cross-linked using specific monoclonal antibodies.

The hepatotropic MHV3 serotype induces acute or chronic hepatitis according to the strain, age and immune status of the mouse. Moreover, MHV3 can replicate in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and Kupffer cells (KC), leading to virus-induced cell death, resulting in a fulminate hepatitis in susceptible C57BL/6 mice, and their death within 3-5 days postinfection (p.i.). 11 We have previously reported that the development of hepatitis in pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected C57BL/6 mice is related to a decrease in splenic and myeloid NK cells because of the formation of syncytia and their subsequent apoptosis. 12 Moreover, in vivo depletion of NK cells during MHV infections enhances virus replication, which in turn leads to a more pronounced hepatitis. 13 In contrast, no or low decreases in NK cells were detected in mice infected with attenuated virus variants, 12,14 suggesting a protective role of NK cells in hepatitis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 549, "end": 551, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 784, "end": 786, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 929, "end": 931, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}, {"text": "Interferon-c is known to play a protective role against the hepatitis induced by various MHV serotypes. 15, 16 Very few studies have targeted the efficiency of NK cell functions during MHV infection.

It was shown that CEACAM1 homotypic interactions between NK cells and various target cells inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity. 19 In addition, the engagement of CEACAM1a leads to the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and IFN-c production by NKT cells. 20 In contrast, toll-like receptor-dependent activation of nuclear factor-jB upregulates the expression of CEACAM1a, whereas IFN-c downregulates it, so decreasing the permissivity of susceptible cells to MHV infection. 21, 22 CEA-CAM1a is expressed at the surface of hepatic cells including LSEC, KC, hepatocytes and B and NK cells, but is scarce or not expressed by naive CD4 + or CD8 + T cells.

Hepatic NK cells normally colocalize at sites expressing viral antigen and IFN-c during infection. 47 This environment may allow NK cells to receive cell-to-cell or cell-tomatrix contact signals that favour an IL-12-dependent IFN-c secretion, as NK cells are differently activated by IL-18 depending on their localization. 48 However, recruited NK cells in liver require activation by adequate levels of IL-12 and IL-18 to become high producers of IFN-c. It is known that liver KC produced IL-12 and IL-18 following various stimuli and activated intrahepatic NK and NKT cells to produce IFN-c. 49 The results that we have provided are in agreement with a previous in vivo study, reporting that treatment with rIL-12 and rIL-18 of susceptible mice creates an anti-MHV3 state by significantly increasing IFN-c production. 18 However, IL-12 and IL-18 were not induced in livers from L2-MHV3-infected C57BL/6 mice, preventing the synergistic IFN-c production by recruited NK cells.
