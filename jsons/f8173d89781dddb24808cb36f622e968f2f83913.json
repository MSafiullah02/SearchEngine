The precise role of TCF7L2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in adult adipocytes remains to be defined. Here, we aim to investigate how changes in TCF7L2 expression in mature adipocytes affect glucose homeostasis. Tcf7l2 was selectively ablated from mature adipocytes in C57BL/6J mice using an adiponectin promoter-driven Cre recombinase to recombine alleles floxed at exon 1 of the Tcf7l2 gene. Mice lacking Tcf7l2 in mature adipocytes displayed normal body weight. Male mice exhibited normal glucose homeostasis at eight weeks of age. Male heterozygote knockout mice (aTCF7L2het) exhibited impaired glucose tolerance (AUC increased 1.14 \u00b1 0.04 -fold, p=0.03), as assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, and changes in fat mass at 16 weeks (increased by 1.4 \u00b1 0.09-fold, p=0.007). Homozygote knockout mice exhibited impaired oral glucose tolerance at 16 weeks of age (AUC increased 2.15 \u00b1 0.15-fold, p=0.0001). Islets of Langerhans exhibited impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro (decreased 0.54 \u00b1 0.13-fold aTCF7L2KO vs control, p=0.02), but no changes in in vivo glucosestimulated insulin secretion. Female mice in which one or two alleles of the Tcf7l2 gene was knocked out in adipocytes displayed no changes in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion.",

Mice with biallelic Tcf7l2 deletion exposed to high fat diet for 9 weeks exhibited impaired glucose tolerance (p=0.003 at 15 min after glucose injection) which was associated with reduced in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (decreased 0.51 \u00b1 0.03-fold, p=0.02). Thus, our data indicate that loss of Tcf7l2 gene expression in adipocytes leads to impairments on metabolic responses which are dependent on gender, age and nutritional status. Our findings further illuminate the role of TCF7L2 in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.",

For example, TCF7L2 is required for the maintenance of functional pancreatic beta cell mass and insulin release from the endocrine pancreas [2, 3] . In the liver, ablation of Tcf7l2 expression from hepatocytes has variously been shown to lead to reduced hepatic glucose production and improved glucose homeostasis [4] , or hyperglycemia [5] .",

Humans carrying the T risk allele at rs7903146 have elevated proinsulin levels, lowered first-phase insulin secretion and impaired responses to the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Whilst TCF7L2 variants appear chiefly to affect pancreatic beta cell function in man, the mechanisms driving impaired insulin secretion are still poorly defined [18, 19] . Although rs7903146 in TCF7L2 is not associated with changes in overall TCF7L2 transcription (i.e. of all isoforms), with conflicting data regarding the association of rs7903146 with specific TCF7L2 variant expression in subcutaneous fat [20] [21] [22] , TCF7L2 expression has been shown to be reduced in adipose tissue from type 2 diabetes subjects [23] and in obese mice [24] . Additionally, surgery-induced weight loss has been shown to regulate alternative splicing of Tcf7l2 in adipose tissue [25] . TCF7L2 splice variant expression is regulated by plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids [25, 26] , with evidence indicating that acute intake of fat leads to reduced expression of TCF7L2 in human adipocytes [27] . Thus, overall these data suggest that changes in TCF7L2 expression may be linked to adaptation to changes in fuel intake.",

For example, previous reports have described the impact of loss of TCF7L2 expression on adipocyte development and insulin sensitivity [24, 29] . In the present study, we used a genetic model of ablation of TCF7L2 gene expression in mature adipocytes to determine whether TCF7L2 plays a role in adipocyte function, independent of its role in adipogenesis. We have focused on whether loss of TCF7L2 expression in the adipocyte impacts the release of hormones involved in glucose homeostasis, notably insulin and incretins. In this way, we sought to explore the possibility that altered TCF7L2 expression in the adipocyte may contribute to type 2 diabetes risk through downstream effects on multiple effector organs [28, 30] .",

However, the regulation of TCF7L2 expression is also essential. High-fat feeding modulates TCF7L2 expression in pancreatic islets, in hepatocytes and in human adipocytes [27, 36, 37] . Furthermore, studies have suggested that variation in TCF7L2 expression altered glucose metabolism and induces type 2 diabetes phenotype [38] . We found that deletion of a single Tcf7l2 allele generates distinct features of obesity-induced glucose intolerance while biallelic Tcf7l2 deletion reveals a disruption of endocrine signalling molecules. Therefore, alterations induced by deletion of Tcf7l2 in mature adipocytes could depend on age and on the dosage of TCF7L2 expression.",

This suggests that a compensatory effect is unmasked in aTCF7L2KO mice to stimulate insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells when the incretin effect is compromised. One possible explanation to reconcile our findings on in vivo and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is that elevated fatty levels compensate in part for the lowered levels of circulating incretins, acting to amplify insulin release through the action of fatty acid receptors. NEFA and specifically long-chain fatty acids potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [39, 40] . Moreover, a direct insulinotropic action of FABP4, a cytosolic lipid chaperone expressed and secreted by white and brown adipocytes may act directly on pancreatic beta cells as demonstrated in previous studies showing that recombinant FABP4 administration enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo [41, 42] . In a small type 2 diabetes cohort, increased serum FABP4 was correlated to enhanced insulin release [43] . Taking these findings together, lowered circulating incretins may have provoked impaired glucose tolerance with no apparent change in beta cell function to release insulin in vivo-compensated by stimulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by higher circulating FABP4 and NEFA-in aTCF7L2KO mice.",

Moreover, the genetic variant is localized near the regulatory region for Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain 5 (ACSL5) which activates fatty acids to generate long chain fatty acyl CoA [45] . Consistent with our model, Martchenko and colleagues [46] have recently reported fatty acid-induced lowering of circadian release of GLP-1 from L-cells as a result of decreased Bmal1 expression. Similarly, Filipello et al [47] reported decreased insulin-dependent GLP-1 secretion from L-cell-derived GLUTag cells, and increased glucagon release, upon fatty acid treatment. Similar findings on GLP-1 secretion were reported by others [48, 49] , whist long chain saturated (palmitate) but not unsaturated (oleate) fatty acids lead to L-cell apoptosis [50] . On the other hand, activation of free fatty acid receptors with FFAR1/GPR40 agonist TAK-875 [51] or with short-chain fatty acids (FFAR2/GPR43) [52] acutely increased GLP-1 secretion from L-cells, indicating a balance between shorter term, and more chronic \"lipotoxic\" effects, is likely to govern overall GLP-1 production, with the latter predominating after Tcf7l2 deletion in adipocytes. To explore further the direct role of TCF7L2 in lipid metabolism, future studies will be necessary to assess lipolysis and insulin action in adipocyte lacking TCF7L2.",

            "text": "In this study, high fat diet feeding altered glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Some discrepancies emerge from our report and the previous studies using the same genetic model. When examining the effects of conditional deletion Tcf7l2 in mature adipocytes, Chen et al. [29] found impairments in glucose tolerance after intraperitoneal injection of glucose in 3-month-old males and females under standard diet associated with hepatic insulin resistance. Geoghegan et al. [24] also generated a conditional knockout of Tcf7l2 in the adipocyte, reporting that knockout animals maintained on regular chow displayed no change in intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, whilst exaggerated insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance were apparent after high fat feeding [24] . The authors demonstrated a role for TCF7L2 in regulating lipid metabolism, finding a reduction in lipid accumulation and lipolysis during high fat feeding. We note that slightly different genetic strategies were used to create the mouse models in each case. Thus, both our own and the earlier studies used a similar same LoxP strategy with a Cre recombinase under the control of the adiponectin promoter, but we have deleted exon 1, whereas Chen et al. targeted exon 11 and Geoghegan et al. targeted exon 5 [24, 29] . The Tcf7l2 gene consists of 17 exons [53] and tissue-specific splicing variants could exert tissue-dependent distinct function and impact differently on specific cell type function such as the adipocyte or the beta cell [54] . Alternative splicing of Tcf7l2 potentially results in transcripts lacking exons 1 and 2 predicted to encode proteins lacking the \u03b2-catenin-binding domain [22] . Might changes in TCF7L2 expression in adipose tissue contribute to the effects of type 2 diabetes-associated variants? Whilst inspection of data in the GTEX database [55] does not reveal any genotype-driven alteration in subcutaneous or breast adipose tissue TCF7L2 expression for rs7903146, we note that other intronic variants in this gene, such as rs6585195, reveal significant expression quantitative trait loci for TCF7L2, and may conceivably influence incretin and insulin levels through the mechanisms identified here.",

Our findings provide an unexpected insight into the action of TCF7L2 and reveal a novel mechanism through which adipocytes may impact insulin and incretin secretion. In demonstrating an action on multiple tissues, we also reveal a new level of complexity in the effects of gene action at the systems level on disease risk. Such findings may highlight the importance of early interventions with incretins when TCF7L2 expression is compromised and therefore the development of novel personalized therapies.",
