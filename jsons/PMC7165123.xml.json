The Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC) Response v3.0 system (Elekta, Sweden) facilitates moderate Deep Inspiration Breath Hold (mDIBH) for cardiac sparing breast radiotherapy. The ABC system has been used at our institution for the majority of left breast radiotherapy treatments since 2013 to reduce the radiation dose to heart. The system is fully integrated with the linac and permits gated radiotherapy delivery. Patients breathe through a snorkel into the ABC system and the system controls the volume of air in the lungs and the duration of the breath hold. Based on the recommendation to avoid use of active breathing control for breast radiotherapy in the recent publication entitled \u201cCOVID-19: Global Radiation Oncology\u2019s Targeted Response for Pandemic Preparedness\u201d (Simcock et al., 2020), the medical physics and radiotherapy teams were tasked with transitioning patients receiving breast radiotherapy from mDIBH using the ABC system to a visually-monitored voluntary breath hold (vBH) technique within a very short time frame.",

Aside from the difference in breath hold techniques and the requirement to manually gate the linear accelerator, the radiotherapy delivery process remained largely unchanged. Skin marks were placed on a patient\u2019s left side in a location that was visible using the CCTV system. Skin marks consisted of three parallel lines separated by 5 mm. Patients were coached into vBH while the marks on skin were monitored relative to the coronal laser. When the skin marks align with the coronal laser, the beam is turned on. Skin marks are shown in Figure 1\nbelow for a patient while free breathing (Figure 1(a)) and while in breath hold (Figure 1(b)). A count down timer was used to monitor the breath hold duration.",

Patients able to hold their breath for a minimum of 18 s were considered eligible for vBH treatment. This minimum breath hold requirement is consistent with the previous requirement using the ABC device and was established to facilitate efficient delivery. Patients were also required to understand the breathing instructions to be eligible for vBH. If both of these eligibility criteria were met, then patients were coached on how to breathe (through mouth or nose according to patient comfort and with relaxed shoulders and back). vBH reproducibility was assessed by monitoring the marks on patients\u2019 skin relative to the coronal laser prior to CT acquisition. Relevant information from the vBH training at the time of simulation was transcribed to the patient treatment setup note and included maximum breath hold duration, tattoo table heights for free breathing and vBH.",

For boost deliveries, radiation therapists needed to make a single extra trip into the room to mark the patient\u2019s skin. To accommodate the additional entries into the treatment room and skin marking steps, appointment times were increased by 10 minutes for tangent and four field treatments for the first fraction and increased by 5 minutes for subsequent fractions.

The most significant challenge is anticipated for the patients simulated using the ABC system but receiving treatment using the vBH technique. For this reason, skin marks included three parallel lines: the central line to be aligned with the coronal laser while in breath hold, a line 5 mm anterior to the central line and a line 5 mm posterior to the central line. This generous skin mark threshold was included in the process to accommodate any patients whose breath hold with the vBH technique differed greatly from the ABC technique. The ABC system is configured for each patient to hold their breath at 80% of the maximum inhalation volume. For some patients being coached into a voluntary breath hold, it may be difficult to appreciate the 80% maximum inhalation threshold. The tendency for some patients was to overshoot the displacement between the free breathing and breath hold tattoo table height. Additional coaching was required such that patients were able to better match the breath hold achieved at CT simulation. The +/- 5 mm skin mark thresholds were found to be unnecessary as patients were able to execute the vBH technique reproducibly. Challenges of this nature are not anticipated for the patients CT simulated and treated in a vBH state.",
