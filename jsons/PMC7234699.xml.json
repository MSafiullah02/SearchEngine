Based on all I have heard from the scientific community, a review of the literature, and a review of historical facts related to other epidemics, I believe we are missing some key points, particularly with regard to how we are approaching prevention of morbidity and mortality. My opinion is the virus is not killing people, but rather the immune response to the virus. Perhaps we need to shift our thinking from screening and treating signs and symptoms to add risk stratifying, measuring, and treating inflammation. I think this approach needs to be seriously vetted. It might be used to screen not just our patients, but also our physicians and nurses to determine who should be seeing patients frontline vs remotely, which patients should be admitted, and which should be sent home.",

However, we must also consider novel approaches to treat patients who have been infected or may get infected while we wait for a vaccine.",
