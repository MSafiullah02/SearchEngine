Methods: The plasmid pET-MS2-pac was constructed with one C-variant pac site, and then the plasmid pM-CR-2C containing 1,891-bp chimeric sequences and two C-variant pac sites was produced. Meanwhile, three plasmids (pM-CR-C, pM-CR-2W and pM-CR-W) were obtained as parallel controls with a different number and affinity of the pac site . Finally, the armored RNA was expressed and purified. Results: The armored RNA with 1,891 bases target RNA was expressed successfully by the one-plasmid expression system with two C-variant pac sites , while for one pac site , no matter whether the affinity was changed or not, only the 1,200 bases target RNA was packaged. It was also found that the C-variant pac site could increase the expression efficiency of the armored RNA. The armored RNA with 1,891-bp exogenous RNA in our study showed the characterization of ribonuclease resis-",

It has also been confirmed that the presence of a second pac site permits the cooperative binding of the coat protein dimer to the RNA and results in a higher affinity compared with a single pac site [17, 18] .
