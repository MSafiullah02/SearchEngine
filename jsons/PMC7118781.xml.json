The virus is shed in ocular and nasal secretions, saliva, urine, and feces [1]. Viral shedding begins approximately 7 days postinfection [3]. The primary site of viral replication is the respiratory epithelium and lymphoid tissue of the nasopharynx [1], [4]. The virus disseminates by way of peripheral blood leukocytes to the liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, and brain. Viremia has been documented 2 days postinoculation or infection and persists until the virus is neutralized by antibodies or the animal dies [5]. Gastric hypochlorhydria has been associated with CDV infection in ferrets [6]. The lack of gastric acid was hypothesized to be due to direct action of the virus on gastric mucosa or was secondary to the viral effect on the central nervous system.",

            "text": "Infected ferrets become symptomatic after an incubation period of 7 to 10 days [1], [7], [8]. In ferrets, natural CDV infection most often consists of a catarrhal phase followed by a fatal neurotropic phase [9]. The initial phase is characterized by anorexia, pyrexia, conjunctivitis, and serous nasal discharge. An erythematous, pruritic rash appears on the chin (\nFig. 1) and eventually spreads to the inguinal area [1], [9]. Hyperkeratosis of the footpads (\nFig. 2) occurs inconsistently in ferrets [1]. Melena may be observed early in the course of the disease [1], [9]. Some ferrets die during the catarrhal phase secondary to bacterial infections, such as pneumonia. Clinical signs that are seen in the neurotropic phase include hyperexcitability, muscle tremors, hypersalivation, seizures, and coma. Ferrets die 12 to 16 days after being infected with ferret-adapted CDV [1], [8]. The disease has a longer course when ferrets are infected with a wild canine strain; death occurs 21 to 35 days postinfection [1]. Sometimes a decrease in temperature is observed by the time the animals become moribund [4].",

The virus is inactivated by heat, visible light, and commonly used disinfectants (0.75% phenol, 0.2% roccal, 2%\u20135% sodium hydroxide, and 0.1% formalin) [1], [3]. Some investigators reported that out of more than 1000 cases of distemper, not a single ferret survived the infection [8]. Blair et al [12] treated distemper in a 7-month-old ferret while in the catarrhal phase. The ferret's life span and quality of life were improved with treatments, but the neurotropic phase could not be prevented and the animal was euthanized. When faced with an outbreak of canine distemper in a ferret colony, euthanasia and repopulation following disinfection is recommended.",

Fervac-D is a modified-live virus vaccine of chick cell origin. A 5.9% incidence of anaphylactic reaction has been reported with this vaccine [13]. Adverse events developed within 25 minutes and were characterized by hyperemia, hypersalivation, and vomiting. Purevax is a lyophilized vaccine of a recombinant canary pox vector that expresses the HA and F glycoproteins of CDV. The manufacturer uses the term \u201cferret distemper\u201d vaccine on the product label to prevent confusion with their canine products; however, there is no such thing as a \u201cferret distemper virus\u201d and ferrets are infected by CDV. The absence of adjuvant or entire distemper virus decreased postvaccination risks and the manufacturer reports an incidence of 0.3% reversible anaphylactic reactions in its field safety trials. Another modified-live canine distemper vaccine attenuated in primate cell line (Galaxy D, Schering Plough Animal Health, Omaha, Nebraska) has been studied in ferrets. This vaccine was effective in preventing canine distemper in young ferrets that were challenged with virulent CDV after two vaccine inoculations [14]; however, the duration of immunity and the incidence of vaccine reactions are unknown. Clinical use of this vaccine is extra label (not approved for use in ferrets by USDA) and requires informed owner consent. Postvaccinal distemper infections were reported in black-footed ferrets that were vaccinated with chicken embryo\u2013tissue culture\u2013origin CDV vaccine and in domestic ferrets that were vaccinated with canine cell products [15], [16]. Therefore, vaccination of ferrets with these products must not be performed.",

Coronavirus-like particles may be identified in the feces by electron microscopy during the acute phase of the disease process.

Syringe feeding with a highly digestible diet (Science Diet A/D, Hill's Prescription Diet) may be indicated if anorexia persists.
