The resistance to aging is a key factor for outdoor and medical applications (UV light sterilization). Nonwovens were placed in special chamber with UV light. Changes of physicochemical properties were recorded using differential scanning calorimetry and attenuated total reflection Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy. The fibers' morphology was studied by using scanning electron microscopy. Obtained results clearly showed that only PLA fibers with ZnO particles gained an increase in UV resistance. The paper presents a description of structural changes taking place under the influence of UV aging processes and describes the mechanisms of this process and the effect of ceramic addition on the lifetime of such materials.",

Polyesters are considered to be one of the most important classes of biomaterials [6] . Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), linear polyester, is extensively tested in medicine and tissue engineering, due to its biodegradability, non-toxicity and biocompatibility [7, 8] . PLA is a thermoplastic relatively easy to process. In addition, its mechanical properties are similar to commonly used synthetic polymers. Physicochemical properties of PLA depend on a stereoisomeric form of polymer [9] . Lactic acid (LAc), a repetitive unit of PLA, consists of two optical isomers: D(\u2212)LAc and L(+)LAc. Homochiral PLA is a semicrystalline, isotactic polymer (PLLA and PDLA). Polymerization of D-and L-LAc mixture leads to the formation of heterochiral, atactic PLDLA with amorphous properties.",

PLA could be easily made in various forms and shape, including microspheres and fibers with diameter that ranges from nanometers to micrometers. The main advantage of forming 2D and 3D fibrous scaffolds is a strong anisotropy of properties that allows to adapt material to specific requirements, a very high surface area, and the possibility of creating complex microstructures with specific pores and density [16] .

The resistance to aging is a key factor for outdoor and medicine applications (packaging, stitches, bandage, sterilization). UV stability of PLA-based materials has attracted a lot of attention recently [21] [22] [23] . However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature regarding the influence of UV exposure on the properties of PLA nanocomposite fibers. We hypothesized that modification of fibers with inorganic particles (SiO 2 , ZnO and TiO 2 ) can affect the stability of PLA. ZnO and TiO 2 are effective absorbers of UV [24, 25] and are commonly used as UV-screen agents in sunblocks.

The needle-collector gap influences jet flying time and evaporation of the solvents. Binary-solvent system (DCM and DMF) was used to fabricate PLA-based nonwovens. The SEM images were used to evaluate the quality (morphology and diameter) of obtained PLA fibers. All of the fibers had smooth and defect-free morphology. It was observed that ratio of solvent had a great influence on the fiber diameter (Fig. 2) . Thinner fibers were obtained using ratio 2.5:1, regardless of the polymer concentrations. The other optimized parameter was gap between tip of needle and collector, and polymer concentration. As expected, the diameter of the fibers decreased with increasing needlecollector distance, as shown in Fig. 2a . This was due to the longer time that the solvents had to evaporate. Also, in most cases, increasing the polymer concentration resulted in obtaining fibers with increased diameters (Fig. 2b) . Based on the SEM images, the following parameters were selected to obtain fibers modified with ceramic particles: concentrations of PLA-13%, gap between tip of needle and collector-5 cm, ratio of DCM and DMF-2.5 to 1.",

After 4 h, broken and bent fibers were observed (Fig. 3a) . A similar phenomenon occurred in composites with SiO 2 and TiO 2 (Fig. 3b, c) . The PLA/ZnO fibers behaved differently under the UV exposure. Changes in morphology were much more significant. Fibers fused together and the original microstructure was completely destroyed after 4 h, as shown in Fig. 4d . In addition, the change in the distribution of the fiber alignment was also the most significant (Fig. 4d) . Before the degradation, fibers were arranged almost parallel to each other, but after degradation crossed fibers appeared (Fig. 3d) . However, broken fibers weren't observed even after 4 h of UV exposure. Fibers in PLA nonwoven were arranged parallel to the direction of the collector rotation in major part, as shown in Fig. 4a (y-axis) . The aging process resulted with a slight change, the chart became a little wider, but in the range not exceeding 5% after 10 min of UV exposure. With longer aging time, the fibers broke during relaxing and changed the orientation, which is clearly visible on the graph for 4 h of UV exposure. This phenomenon was intensified even more in the case of composite fibers modified with TiO 2 and SiO 2 (Fig. 4b, c) . Addition of ceramic particles did not promote receiving oriented nonwovens. They generate additional stresses in the fiber. When fiber broke under the UV radiation, it relaxed and changed its direction to a more favorable energetically.

Another characteristic peak at 1750.8 cm \u22121 corresponded to C=O groups [32] . Bands at 1181.3 cm \u22121 and 1084.4 cm \u22121 can be assigned to C-O-C vibrations of ester groups [33] . After aging changes in spectra weren't significant. There was no appearance of new peaks as the result of polymer degradation. Only decrease in some band intensity was observed (Fig. 7a) . The spectra of different composite nonwovens looked similarly to this made of pure PLA (Fig. 7b-d) . The main bands of ceramic fillers could be overlapped and covered by the bands from the polymeric matrix. In addition, method (ATR) chosen to study the effect of photodegradation on composites chemical structure measures only a thin layer having direct contact with the crystal. The infrared analysis of PLA after UV aging test did not show any significant changes of the spectrum or formation of new bands. The characteristic bands of the PLA decreased their intensities, due to the photodegradation of the polymer structure (smaller graphs show peaks for C-H stretching vibrations in PLA chains). In the case of pure PLA fibers, the intensity of bands in the range 3000-2800 cm \u22121 clearly decreased after just 10 min of UV exposure. However, an intensity of whole spectra did not change in a significant way even after 4 h (Fig. 7a ). For composites with ZnO, an intensity of the C-H stretching vibrations decreased more gradually over time. After 10 min, the change seems to be less rapid than in the case of pure PLA (Fig. 7b) . Again, the decrease in peaks in this area was also observed for PLA composites with TiO 2 and SiO 2 . However, in these cases, the changes are much more significant, and after 4 h of UV exposure, the bands almost completely disappeared. Polymer degradation is also indicated by gradual disappearance of peaks in the whole range of spectra (Fig. 7c, d) .",

For pure PLA, three phase transitions were clearly visible on the DSC curve (Fig. 5a): glass transition with recrystallization (63.0-69.3 \u00b0C), cold recrystallization (77.0-94.4 \u00b0C), recrystallization before melting and melting (159.1-172.5 \u00b0C). These transformations were very clear, followed by each other at certain intervals of temperature. This demonstrated that well-oriented and structurally homogeneous fibers formed the nonwoven layer.",

            "text": "The nanocomposite fibers based on poly(lactic acid) were produced successfully by an electrospinning method. The parameters of process (concentration of polymers, gap between needle and collector, ratio of solutions) were optimized to obtain defect-free microfibers. It turned out that the chosen method is very sensitive to changing process conditions. The diameter of the fibers can be easily controlled by increasing the distance between the needle and the collector. The longer solvent evaporation time results in smaller diameter fibers. The addition well dispersed ceramic powders to PLA-based solution completely changed nature of the produced fibers. Ceramic materials, known as UV absorbent, were incorporated into polymer matrix to slow down the aging process. Stability of PLA is a key aspect for using this biopolymer as packaging material and in tissue engineering. The protective effect was noticed only for ZnO particles. The addition of ZnO significantly increased the proportion of crystalline and amorphous phases in the fabricated PLA-based fibers and changed the mechanism of the photodegradation. Similar impact was noticed in the case of TiO 2 and SiO 2 . These additives significantly changed the microstructure of the nonwovens and accelerated matrix degradation. They caused cracking and breaking of fibers.",
