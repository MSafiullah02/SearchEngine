            "text": "Many central questions in evolutionary biology rely on understanding how individual-level and group-level selective processes interact to shape phenotypic variation and specialisation. Individuals can aggregate into groups, and the composition of these groups, populations, or communities (herein group phenotypic composition or GPC, see Glossary) can affect group-level dynamics and self-organisation. For example, large groups of highly similar individuals can benefit from lower predation pressure by making it difficult for predators to track individuals (the confusion effect [1,2]). Eventually, this can drive selection operating on individual phenotypes [3,4], in this case by selecting against rare phenotypes because individuals who look different will be more likely to be taken by predators (the oddity effect [1]). Selection arising from GPC can lead to an evolutionary response of individual phenotypes. GPC can shape the evolution of behaviours that mediate individual movements between groups, phenotypic plasticity (individuals adjust their phenotype in response to particular GPCs), or phenotypic traits that allow individuals to manipulate the characteristics of their group. Selection from GPC can also directly modify the covariance between individual and group phenotypes through the removal of particular phenotypes within generations. All these evolutionary responses at the individual level are likely to modify GPC itself. Despite extensive theoretical considerations (see [5]), the role of GPC as an agent of selection shaping individual fitness and as an emergent property of the individual phenotypes have rarely been considered together in empirical studies.",

For example, moving animal groups can contain both leaders and followers [6,7]. Much could be learnt about the evolution of leadership by simultaneously assessing how consistent behavioural differences affect group-level outcomes\n[8] and how group-level outcomes select for particular phenotypes or shape the distribution of phenotypes in the population. Social selection\n[4] and social heterosis\n[9] offer candidate frameworks to study selection arising from the social context, but these still need to be expanded to capture the complexities that can arise from the interactions between individuals (Figure 1).

We use this framework to draw general predictions about how GPC affects the evolution of individual phenotypes and ecological processes, and how the feedback between the evolution of individual phenotypes and group-level outcomes alters GPC. We then show how this framework can be applied to an array of fields by detailing empirical studies that have investigated the role of GPC in either shaping individual fitness or generating emergent properties of animal groups. We hope that outlining the similarities among topics will help to create an integrated research agenda to begin addressing the effects of GPC on individual fitness (selective consequences) and the response of individuals to the selective consequences of GPC (evolutionary implications) in unison.",

GPC can be a function of the phenotypes of its members (such as the frequency of fast-exploring individuals, or the phenotype of the least-exploratory individual) [11] or an emergent property that is not attributable to any single individual, such as the mating system (see section 2.2 in [12]). GPC can affect individual fitness by influencing the overall performance of the group on collective tasks, affecting all the members of any given group equally, or by affecting the relative performance of different phenotypes within groups. For instance, a group with more aggressive individuals can be more successful at foraging, but aggressive individuals can have a higher fitness than non-aggressive individuals because they can monopolise a larger share of the total resources. It is interesting to note that the selection acting on individual phenotypes within groups can conflict with the selection acting on the individual phenotypes among groups [13]. Studying fitness in the context of phenotypes and how GPC modulates fitness, both within and across species, provides good insights on the overall potential selective consequences of GPC for the individuals within them.",

            "text": "In addition to requiring phenotypic variation in fitness, net selection strongly depends on the covariance between the phenotype of an individual and the phenotypes of those it associates with [4,14]. For example, if individual phenotypes experience all possible types of GPCs (i.e., GPC is effectively random) then no net selection will arise from GPC (although other mechanisms, such as genetic drift, may still shape GPC). A key insight is that a range of behavioural traits and ecological processes can determine the covariance pattern in GPC, and hence drive net selection. For example, limited dispersal can result in individuals with similar phenotypes forming groups more often than random. Thus, behaviours can therefore modulate the strength of selection arising from GPC on other traits [4]. For instance, aggressive male water striders (Aquarius remigis) respond to negative fitness effects of aggressiveness within their group by moving between groups [15]. Similarly, many species respond to competition under different ecological conditions by switching between single-species groups and mixed-species groups [16].",

These theoretical tools are applicable to studying the evolutionary implications of GPC (Box 1). Individuals can respond to the effect of GPC by altering the phenotypic composition of the group (for example by controlling access to the group) and/or by changing their own phenotype (phenotypic plasticity in response to the phenotypic composition of their group). The strength and shape of such individual responses will largely determine whether selection can drive an evolutionary response to GPC [5,18]. Interestingly, phenotypes can differ in how much they can or do contribute to the group's outcome (e.g., by manipulating the GPC) or in how much they can or do adjust their phenotype to their GPC. For example, a larger body size or higher aggressiveness could enable an individual to alter its social environment to a greater extent. Such individuals might also exhibit a lower plasticity level than smaller or less aggressive individuals.",

            "text": "Combining the effect of GPC on individual fitness with an analysis of its selective consequences and evolutionary implications allows us to identify five main ways in which group composition can matter for the evolution of individual phenotypes or for the maintenance of phenotypic variation (Box 1). First, GPC can simply alter the fitness consequences associated with individual phenotypes (i.e., via direct selection, \u03b2y, or by selection mediated by the properties of their group, \u03b2yz, Box 1). Second, individual phenotypes can co-vary with group composition (high COVzy) and thus modulate the net selection force exerted on individual phenotypes. Third, GPC can affect the expression, and therefore the heritability, of individual phenotypes. Hence, GPC can amplify or weaken the ability of the population to respond to selective pressures (high or low \u03a8zy). Fourth, if GPC modulates selection, and individual phenotypes can respond to selective pressures, this can drive a feedback between them. A synergy between the effect of the group on individual phenotypes (\u03a8zy) and the contribution of individual phenotypes to the group composition (\u03a8yz) can substantially increase or decrease the pace of evolutionary change in response to selection arising from GPC. Fifth, GPC is also an emergent property of genotypes and their patterns of expression. Hence, GPC or group-level outcomes could also be associated with genetic variation, respond to selection, and be an adaptation. The exact function linking genetic variation (or variation in breeding values) at the individual level to GPC at the group level, f(Gz, Gy), will determine how much genetic variation in group composition is available for selection to shape group-level processes. Further, interacting phenotype theory typically considers only the group mean, although indirect genetic effects can make the group mean phenotype very different than a simple mean of the mean of the breeding values. In cases where group variance or extremes are important, linking GPC to individual breeding values remains unclear. Determining the amount of genetic variation in group mean phenotype, in the phenotypic variation, or in the phenotypic range still requires proper mathematical formalisation and is a major gap in this area.",

GPC can only matter when it introduces differences, or equalises existing differences, in fitness across different phenotypes (\u03b2y and \u03b2yz differ from zero). Assuming this is the case, GPC will have stronger selective consequences when the phenotypes of the members of a group or community are non-random (the covariance COVzy is high). An important prediction here is that net selection has the potential to be stronger in smaller groups (because, by definition, COVzy decreases with group size). Similarly, relatedness among group members leads to a higher covariance (COVzy), and therefore groups with high relatedness should experience stronger selection arising from GPC. Higher covariance can also arise from habitat preferences, segregation, or local adaptation coupled with limited dispersal. Hence we expect GPC to be associated with stronger selection in these situations. Note that some aspects of GPC (e.g., the average phenotype of a group) can co-vary with the phenotype of its members to a greater extent than other aspects (e.g., the variance, or the highest phenotypic value).",

On the other hand, when traits are labile and can be modulated in response to the environment (e.g., individuals can express varying levels of aggressiveness in different contexts), then we expect that selection associated with GPC will affect the evolution of individual phenotypic plasticity in response to their social environment (\u03a8zy) and/or the evolution of the effect that individuals have on the characteristics of their group (\u03a8yz, which can eventually lead to niche construction\n[19,20]).

Similarly, colonies of social spiders with more-aggressive individuals have a higher foraging success because aggressive individuals approach prey faster [26]. Individuals can also vary in the ability or propensity to innovate [27] and socially learn [28], hence GPC might affect the ability for groups to acquire and exploit novel foraging opportunities (\u03b2y). GPC can also affect the relative fitness of members within groups (\u03b2yz): for example, food is shared more equally in mixed-personality shoals of guppies compared to shoals with only shy or bold individuals [24].",

Reduced competition can facilitate larger flocks, resulting in secondary benefits such as rapid information transfer (\u03b2y or COVzy) [30\u201333] and better problem solving [34]. Within species, different individuals might also specialise on specific resources or vary in the range of food items they eat [35], which affects competition for food resources [36].

Thus, GPC can affect the fitness of all group members equally by collectively reducing their predation risk (confusion effect, \u03b2y) or favour particular phenotypes (oddity effect, \u03b2yz). For example, predation risk for prey of particular body sizes varies depending on the ratio of small to large individuals [2], and odd fish are disproportionately likely to leave their shoal (thus affecting COVzy) [38]. The defensive ability of a given group also varies with group composition: in honey bee Apis mellifera colonies, the proportion of defensive individuals affects the recruitment of workers against intruders, the defensive response of the colony, and the fitness of all the colony members [39]. Disease dynamics and parasite prevalence can also depend on the presence of a few highly social or promiscuous individuals in groups acting as super-spreaders [40\u201342]. For example, \u2018Typhoid Mary\u2019, or the flight attendant spreading the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus between Asia and America, disproportionately contributed to major disease outbreaks. The consequences of group composition for disease dynamics is usually thought to decrease the fitness of all the group members in a similar way (\u03b2y). However, GPC could also affect disease dynamics that differentially impact on particular phenotypes (\u03b2yz). High levels of kinship could favour disease transmission if kinship promotes physical contact among kin members [43], and net selection force can be stronger due to higher phenotypic covariance among group members (high COVzy). By contrast, groups with higher genetic variation (Gz) can have lower disease prevalence if this reduces contact or transmission rates.",

Cooperation among colony members is more common in colonies with high relatedness, either because it is beneficial for individuals to cooperate with kin (increase their \u03a8zy) or because related groups with cooperative individuals outcompete other groups (\u03b2y and COVzy) [45]). Beyond these well-established effects, overall colony fitness can depend on the personality composition of its members. In North American ants Temnothorax longisinosus, colonies with greater variance in worker aggressiveness and exploration have increased per capita productivity via greater specialisation (\u03b2y) [46,47]. In the fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), a threshold frequency of \u2018tolerant workers\u2019 determines the acceptance of multiple queens into the colony [48]. This could potentially impact on the reproductive output of the colony. Similarly, in honey bees, workers vary in their responsiveness to queen pheromone (i.e., \u03a8zy), and less-responsive workers are more likely to activate their ovaries and compete with the queen over reproduction [49]. Hence, worker responsiveness can affect the extent of competition over reproduction within the colony (\u03b2yz). GPC can evolve in response to different environments: in social spiders, where all individuals reproduce and have no caste specialisation, colonies with more-docile individuals fair better in communities with less competitors [50] (Box 2). GPC can also become adapted to specific ecological conditions: when perturbed, colonies of social spiders recreate the specific optimal composition of their native environment [51].",

Informed individuals can also lead groups to resources [55]. In homing pigeons, experienced individuals contribute more to the route of the group back to the coop [56], while old female matriarch killer whales (Orcinus orca) lead the group to resources when food abundance is low [57].

For example, the presence of aggressive individuals in groups of water striders has a well-known effect on the operational sex ratio and mating activity within mating pools (e.g., [61]). The presence of aggressive individuals drives other individuals out of the local area and decreases the intensity of scramble competition for females (aggressive individuals exhibit a strong \u03a8yz). This reduces the overall mating rates of the group (\u03b2y), but under these new social conditions more-aggressive males can get a bigger share of the mating (\u03b2yz) (when measured at the individual level [13]).

Nevertheless, the distribution of particular morphological [65], life-history [66], or behavioural traits [67] can affect the overall population growth of all members (\u03b2y) or favour particular phenotypes relative to others (\u03b2yz). Group diet or niche composition can also alter the interactions between a population and its community [36]. Eventually, the characteristics of interspecific interactions or other higher levels processes can co-vary with particular individual phenotypes, and act as agents of selection on the phenotype of the individual (\u03b2y or \u03b2yz, and COVzy) [68,69]. Note that changes in GPC can occur either because individuals join or leave a group or community, or because individuals plastically modulate their phenotype in response to their group (\u03a8zy, Box 3).",

            "text": "To summarise, GPC (i.e., the average phenotype, presence of keystone individuals, or variability in phenotypes) affects individual fitness in a variety of contexts (e.g., mating, foraging, decision making) over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. In some cases, GPC impacts upon individual fitness long after the initial group members are gone (e.g., if behaviours are culturally transmitted), but GPC can also exert selection in populations consisting of highly ephemeral group membership [30]. Considering such group-level dynamics in the context of GPC opens up a range of questions, such as \u2018do species with fission-fusion exhibit more or less phenotypic variation in groups than socially-stable species?\u2019 Further issues are listed in the Outstanding Questions. Notably, the evolutionary implications of GPC are still rarely studied, as is the potential for GPC to shape the patterns of social organisation we observe in animal groups across multiple levels of selection (Box 4 gives a description of the types of data needed to study this). Individual behaviour and ecology not only determine the effects of GPC on individual fitness but also influence to what extent individual phenotypes co-vary with their group composition, and how groups and individuals determine each other's behaviours. Moreover, group-to-individual covariance, the constraints placed on individual phenotypes by the group, and individual contributions to group-level outcomes are thought to have the ability to evolve in response to selection [4,5] generated by GPC. Nevertheless, no theory or empirical work has investigated the implications of such a claim for the evolution of individual and group phenotypes.",

            "text": "The group, community, or population phenotypic composition has both pervasive consequences for individual fitness and fascinating evolutionary implications. GPC has the potential to shape many attributes of individual phenotypes and/or the distribution of phenotypes in populations. Importantly, understanding what drives the evolutionary implications of GPC requires not only quantifying how GPC affects individual performance (i.e., estimating selection gradients) but also considering the patterns of phenotypic covariance within groups (or aggregations at other levels). Another key aspect to studying the impact of phenotypic variation is to quantify the extent to which individuals and those they interact with modulate each other's behaviours. How this underpins phenotypic covariance is rarely studied. A fascinating area for further theoretical and empirical research is the idea that these parameters can evolve (or co-evolve), and this could potentially have profound effects on the dynamics of phenotypic adaptation. We emphasise the urgent need for theory to be expanded to support empirical research, and the need for future research that is tightly focused on the mechanisms determining the formation of groups in terms of individual phenotypes and group composition (for example, do groups reflect the underlying distribution of individuals in the wider population, or do individuals actively choose groups according to phenotypic composition?). We further emphasise the need for theoretical advances in understanding the co-evolution or co-dependence of group composition with the expression or value of individual phenotypes (through indirect effects). The study of the selective consequences and evolutionary outcomes of GPC is an area of increasing interest across a breadth of research areas. It will continue to be an exciting area of research, with potential to contribute to many classical questions in ecology and evolution.Outstanding Questions \u2013 The Evolutionary Implications of GPCA key challenge in answering key questions in many disciplines is to analyse both the effects of group composition on group outcomes and the effect of group outcomes for group composition [(i) and (ii), respectively].  Foraging(i)How do interference competition, foraging tactics, and facilitation determine the relative foraging success of different phenotypes in the group?(ii)How do different phenotypes resolve conflicts of interest in forming or maintaining GPC?  Niche Partitioning(i)Do particular individuals control GPC, or does GPC emerge from a shared process determined by existing niche preferences? What ecological conditions favour phenotypic segregation (or mixing) via niche preferences versus niche construction?(ii)Can selection emerging from GPC lead to phenotypic segregation and ultimately the divergence of new species? Or maintain phenotypic variation in the species?  Predator\u2013Prey (or Host\u2013Parasite) Interactions(i)How does GPC in prey and predators affect synchronisation between predator\u2013prey dynamics?(ii)How do predator\u2013prey dynamics impact on GPC within species?  Altruism and Eusociality(i)How does the mix of cooperators and defectors affect group dynamics?

(A) Individuals show remarkable phenotypic variation in their morphology, behaviour, and life history. (B) Hence, groups (or populations/communities) can vary in their GPC (e.g., their mean phenotype or within group variation). (C) GPC affects group-level outcomes (e.g., the total amount of food a group acquires), thus (D) impacting on individual fitness (Box 1). Beyond the consequences of individual phenotypes on fitness (natural selection), GPC can favour all members (group-level selection) or favour particular phenotypes over others (social selection). Blue (dashed) and black (solid) lines represent two groups with different GPCs. (E) GPC can drive different evolutionary responses. These include traits affecting covariation between individual phenotypes and their GPC (e.g., decisions to join or leave particular groups), the evolution of individual phenotypic plasticity in response to GPC (e.g., individuals change their phenotypes to match the group), or the evolution of individual contributions to GPC (e.g., individuals change the behaviour of group members). These evolutionary responses can then affect the distribution of phenotypes in subsequent generations.",
