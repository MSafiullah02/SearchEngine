FIP was suspected because of the presence of clinical, clinicopathological and histopathological findings that were consistent with the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of numerous FCoV antigen-positive macrophages within the granulomatous lesions, a finding only seen in, and therefore pathognomonic for, FIP (Kipar et al., 1998, Kipar et al., in press).",

An elevated \u03b11-glycoprotein concentration is frequently seen in cats with FIP, but is a non-specific feature of inflammatory diseases in general, and is also found in terminal stages of FIV (Duthie et al 1997). An albumin:globulin ratio of less than 0.6, mild non-regenerative anaemia, lymphopenia and mild hyperbilirubinaemia are also common findings with FIP but are not specific to the disease (Sparkes et al 1994). In this cat the CoV antibody titre was zero and this was an unusual feature of the case. A positive CoV antibody titre is not a universal finding in cats with FIP (Sparkes et al., 1994, Gaskell and Dawson, 2000, Lappin, 2003) and negative CoV antibody titres may occur in cats affected by either \u2018effusive\u2019 or \u2018non-effusive\u2019 forms of the disease (Harvey et al., 1996, Sparkes et al., 1991, Paltrinieri et al., 1998). A number of explanations have been postulated, including lack of circulating CoV antibodies due to immune-complexing with CoV antigen and loss of ability to produce antibodies in the terminal stages of disease (Hoskins 2001).",

The apparent presence of concurrent FIV infection in this case might have predisposed the cat to the development of FIP, as it has been shown that immunosuppression, eg, due to FIV infection, is associated with a higher risk of mutation of non-pathogenic FCoV to pathogenic, FIP-inducing FCoV mutants (Poland et al 1996). Other possible differential diagnoses were not identified by the initial clinicopathological and routine histopathological findings in this case.
