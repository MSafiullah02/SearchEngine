            "text": "It is estimated that 30\u201370% of very low birth weight infants (VLBW) are diagnosed with swallowing dysfunction, with an inverse relationship between severity and gestational age (GA) [1\u20134]. The maturation of suck, swallow, and breathe coordination occurs around 32\u201334 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) in infants born prematurely. It is a common practice in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to initiate the transition from gavage to oral feeds around this PMA [5\u20138] since delayed initiation has been linked to numerous medical and developmental consequences, such as delayed oral motor development, prolonged hospital stays, and the persistence of feeding disorders [6, 9\u201312]. On the other hand, the initiation of oral feeding before preterm infants\u2019 swallowing mechanisms have become fully mature can lead to aspiration [13, 14]. Chronic aspiration results in a persistent inflammatory state, disease progression, and eventually chronic lung injury [15, 16]. Such sequelae can be devastating for the already fragile and developmentally immature lungs of VLBW infants. In addition to their immature suck and swallow coordination that prevents them from protecting their airways, aspiration/penetration is often silent and occurs without any clinical evidence of dysphagia (e.g., coughing, choking, or gagging) [3, 17\u201319], thereby placing this fragile population at even greater risk for aspiration-related complications [2, 20, 21].",

            "text": "Several publications have suggested that aspiration during oral feeding in preterm infants is mainly related to inappropriate swallow\u2013respiration interaction rather than suck\u2013swallow interaction [22, 23]. During their hospital stay, VLBW infants often require respiratory support, including noninvasive ventilation that delivers positive inflation pressure to the airway [24, 25], such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP), and high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) [26, 27]. However, no clear evidence exists to support the practice of oral feeding while on noninvasive respiratory support, where the positive pressure can potentially interfere with the swallow\u2013respiration interaction. Consequently, there exists no consensus or uniform approach among clinicians concerning initiating oral feeds in such situations [28]. Factors that compromise the already immature swallow\u2013respiration interaction in preterm infants have not been adequately investigated. Our previously published data suggested that oral feeding while on NCPAP significantly increased the infants\u2019 risk of laryngeal penetration and tracheal aspiration [17]. The pressurized airflow provided by NCPAP likely interfered with the swallowing mechanism in infants on oral feedings, thereby exacerbating the potential of silent aspiration and its resulting consequences. Other recent publications also advised against orally feeding infants on noninvasive ventilation before further safety studies are available [29\u201332].",

A high degree of coordination between the sensorimotor sequences of respiration and swallowing is required for safe oral ingestion [39], which is often inadequate in infants born preterm due to physiologic instability, immature neurologic systems, and underdeveloped cardiorespiratory systems [2, 14, 40, 41]. Risk factors that further compromise this already immature swallowing mechanism in preterm infants have rarely been evaluated. The use of NCPAP is reported to induce the dilatation of the laryngeal opening in preterm infants and might interfere with the sensory reception of the liquid bolus [42] as well as inhibit the swallow reflex in adults [43]. Our previous publication demonstrated that oral feeding while on NCPAP significantly increased the risk of penetration/aspiration events in preterm infants, as demonstrated by the videofluoroscopic swallow study [17]. The theoretical rationale for this finding was that the presence of pressurized airflow provided by the NCPAP interfered with the sensory reception of the liquid bolus. This interference resulted in altered sensorimotor sequences of the pharyngeal swallowing mechanism, causing a dysfunctional swallow with airway compromise.",

The authors concluded that further studies that evaluate tracheal aspirations while feeding under NCPAP are needed. Another study by Hanin et al. [27] demonstrated that infants with BPD who were fed orally while on NCPAP achieved full feeds faster than those infants who were not fed orally. Although the authors implied the safety of this practice, the study solely involved a chest x-ray to exclude the possibility of aspiration pneumonia, and no direct assessment of airway safety was performed. The implied safety is therefore not supported, as a chest x-ray in pediatrics is not sufficiently sensitive for detecting chronic microaspiration due to dysphagia [44, 45]. Furthermore, the study power was not designed to detect differences in respiratory outcomes.",

You are likely to inhale the food or drink into your lungs.\u201d In spite of the possible detrimental effects of oral feeding during noninvasive ventilation that creates high pressure, the use of such devices (NCPAP and HFNC) in preterm infants during oral feedings is a common practice in many NICUs [25, 27, 48]. Silent aspiration can cause continued inflammation, thus necessitating the requirement for additional respiratory support. Our current retrospective pre\u2013post analysis supports such a risk. In a recent review, experts in the field concluded that the initiation of oral feeds while on noninvasive ventilation can be detrimental, and it is prudent that the routine initiation of oral feeding is avoided while on noninvasive ventilation [30]. However, it has been acknowledged that no published studies guide such practice regarding this important clinical dilemma [30].

In our current study, we found that, while oral feeding was initiated later in Group 2 (median PMA 35.2 weeks vs. 35.8 weeks, p = 0.0001), there was no significant difference in the PMA at which full oral feeding was achieved (median PMA 37.2 weeks vs. 37.6 weeks, p = 0.30). This finding suggests that oral aversion is not a concern. Furthermore, the fact that both groups reached full oral feeding at the same PMA may suggest that the suck\u2013swallow maturation at a specific PMA is a more important determining factor for successful oral feeding than is the introduction of oral feeding at an early PMA, as demonstrated in other studies [49, 50]. This was enforced by the results of Group 3 (Table 2), as infants in this group reached full oral feeding at a similar PMA (37.2 weeks) compared with Group 1, in spite of later initiation of oral feeding (35.9 weeks). This finding may also suggest that infants in Group 1 took a longer time to achieve full feeds due to the altered sensory-motor environment caused by the NCPAP. Infants in Groups 2 and 3 learned to feed under a more typical sensory-motor feeding environment, and therefore learned more proficiently. In addition, no difference was identified in the length of stay between the groups, thereby indicating that withholding the initiation of oral feeding while on NCPAP did not delay the patients\u2019 discharge to home. Interestingly, the outcome measures in Group 3 (Period 1) were similar to Group 2 (Period 2), likely because infants in both groups did not orally feed while on NCPAP.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to the current study. Because it is retrospective in nature, several other factors may have influenced the outcomes. However, there were no significant clinical practice changes recorded in the respiratory or nutritional management of infants within the study period except as mentioned above. We used a ventilator-derived, variable-flow NCPAP system in the current study, for which the findings may not apply to those infants on other types of NCPAP, such as infant flow systems. The differential effect on the outcomes regarding breast milk versus formula was not studied. Also, because our studies were conducted on preterm infants \u226432 weeks GA, which is a group with the most immature suck and swallow mechanisms, the results may not apply to other GA infants. We acknowledge that having a small sample size increases the margin of error and the likelihood that a type II error will skew the results and thereby decrease the study\u2019s power. However, data from this study can be used to design larger confirmatory studies. It is also important to highlight that this study does not suggest that oral feeding on NCPAP should not be attempted in all infants \u226432 weeks gestation. It might be appropriate to allow a selected group of preterm infants to feed while on NCPAP orally, but only after implementing reliable and objective testing that assesses the swallowing\u2013breathing interaction to document the safety of and infants\u2019 readiness for oral feedings.",
