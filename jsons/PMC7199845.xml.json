The overall prevalence of 1.1% (18 of 1019 samples were positive) in the Canadian study was not strictly comparable with our data, because a greater proportion of samples were collected from adult patients [7], with <25% of the samples obtained from children <5 years of age, compared with 62% in the current study. However, 3 (2.5%) of \u223c120 samples obtained from children <5 years of age were found to be positive during the calendar months of October to February, which, again, is a frequency considerably lower than that noted for the matching subset of study subjects in the study from Edinburgh (41 [12%] of 357 individuals were positive for HBoV]). In the French study [8], the overall frequency of HBoV (9 [3.4%] of 263 samples were positive) among children <5 years of age who had samples collected between November and January was similarly 4 times lower than the frequency of 14% (32 of 245 samples were positive) in the matching subset of samples from Edinburgh. Similarly, HBoV was detected in 17 (7%) of 259 study subjects <5 years of age during the winter months in the Australian study [5], compared with the prevalence of 12% noted in the study from Edinburgh. Finally, in Japan, the year-round prevalence of HBoV among children with LRTIs who were found to be negative for other respiratory viruses was 5.7% (18 of 318 patients) [6]. The study does not include enough information for a precise, seasonally adjusted comparison of prevalence with that noted in the Edinburgh study; however, the frequency of HBoV infection among children in Edinburgh who had LRTIs and who were negative for other viruses in Edinburgh was again higher (11% [30] of 247 children were HBoV positive])",

The increased rate of detection may have resulted from differences in the frequencies of HBoV infection in different parts of the world, as well as from different seasonal associations. However, all of the other studies involved the use of PCR assays with a single-round PCR rather than the potentially more-sensitive nested screening and confirmatory PCR methods developed in the current study. Because assay sensitivity was not determined in any of the previously published studies, and because a nonoptimized single-round PCR with a relatively large amplicon size would be unlikely to achieve the sensitivity of nested PCR, it is therefore probable that a proportion of HBoV-positive samples were missed in the earlier studies. Clearly, standardization of assay sensitivity will be important for comparative epidemiological studies in the future",

However, the markedly increased frequencies of detection of HBoV in samples referred to the SVL in December and January were consistent with the peak incidence of HBoV infection in winter described in Australia [5] and Sweden [3]. However, estimates of seasonal prevalence are complicated by the marked differences in the number of sample referrals between summer and winter, coinciding with changes in the incidence of respiratory disease. Indeed, the actual frequencies of HBoV detection per sample may be similar throughout the year. For example, dividing the year into 2 periods (April\u2013September and October\u2013March) yields a frequency of HBoV detection of 3.5% (3 of 85 samples were positive) in the summer in Stockholm, which is similar to the frequency of 3.1% noted in winter (14 of 455 samples were positive) [3]. A similarly constant frequency of detection on a per-sample basis was reported from Canada (8 of 617 samples obtained in summer were positive, and 10 of 592 samples obtained in winter were positive [7]). However, although not indicated in the latter study, monthly totals of samples were clearly adjusted to \u223c50 samples and did not reflect seasonal changes in the numbers of samples referred. Overall, the published data indicating a constant rate of HBoV detection in respiratory samples, irrespective of season, do not distinguish between HBoV being an incidental finding or being associated with seasonal respiratory disease. However, our own data documenting marked changes in rates of HBoV infection even within the 5-month study period (figure 1A) provide the first evidence of a seasonal epidemiological profile that is similar to that of RSV, distinct from that of other respiratory viruses, and independent of sample referral numbers",

The additional observation that the frequency of HBoV infection was higher when another virus was present (table 2) suggests the interesting possibility that HBoV infection may be an exacerbating factor, particularly for RSV infections, with which it has frequently been associated in the present study and in other studies. Coinfections leading to more severe disease have been described for HMPV and RSV [14] and for RSV and coronaviruses with other respiratory pathogens [15]. It is possible that HBoV may similarly increase the severity of RSV and other viruses causing LRTIs, which may be particularly well represented in the current study group. Because of the nature of the diagnostic testing performed, the study group contains a large proportion of individuals with respiratory infections severe enough to require hospitalization. Investigation of the epidemiological profile of HBoV infections among other groups with less severe respiratory infections not requiring clinical referral would clearly be of value",
