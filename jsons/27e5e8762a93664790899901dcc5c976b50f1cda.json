She was apparently suffering from thermic and pain anesthesia in her right leg, together with mild weakness in both legs with left side predominance. Isolectrofocusing of cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) demonstrated oligloclonal bands. There was an immediate good response to steroid treatment, and the patient was discharged with the presumed diagnosis of demyelinating pathology. In January 1988, after a period of relative health with no maintenance therapy, the patient suddenly suffered from a sight reduction, which was more marked in her right eye. Ophthalmological examination revealed right sided optic retrobulbar neuritis and right homonym haemianopsy. T2-weighted cerebral NMR imaging showed optic radiation and rounded hyperenhanced areas in the right occipital lobe and the left optic tract, interpreted as \"demyelinating process\". The clinical evolution, neuroimaging and the first CSF result led to a diagnosis of \"definited MS\" according to Poser criteria [15] , with a clinical course in \"remitting relapsing form\" according to McAlpine (1972) . In January 1992, the patient underwent a second poussSe characterized by nausea, morning vomiting, unsteadiness of gait and horizontal nistagmus: NMR examination revealed further demyelination areas chiefly in peritrigonai locations. This episode was treated with prednisolone 3-4 mg/kg pro die in single administration gradually tapered off over one week. In July 1992, (and therefore eight years after the onset of MS), the patient was admitted to an emergency surgical ward after 20 days of severe abdominal pain, fever, irregular bowell evac.uation and abdominal distension. Explorative laparotomy revealed fluid in the peritoneal cavity, the distension and thickening of the entire colon, and swollen mesentheric lymphonodes.",

The symptoms did not subside and colonoscopy followed: the result was CD (stage IV) extending up to the transverse colon. The morphological and histobioptical features indicated chronic inflammatory bowel disease but, as the pathologist declared such findings acute and not specific for either CD or ulcerative colitis, the patient was taken to the gastroenterological ward for further investigations. The clinical conclusion was at a severe stage (a CD activity index higher than 250) [1] with no neurological signs of any re-exacerbation of the primary disease. Repeated stool cultures proved negative for both the common (Shigella, Salmonella, Staphilococcus) and less common bacterial agents (Clostridium, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Mycobacter, Enterococcus). Therapy was started with parenteral steroids, antibiotics (piperaeilline and metronidazole) and 5ASA per os, as well as with topical treatment (i.e., medicated clyster with steroids and 5ASA). As a consequence, there was a rapid and steady improvement in the clinical situation and the principal biological parameters, and a decrease in the signs of the biohumoral activity of the disease. Six months aP~er the diagnosis of CD, the symptoms are still in remission and the patients is still under maintenance oral therapy of 3 g of 5ASA and 8 mg of methylprednisone pro die.",

            "text": "The etiology of MS and CD are unknown, although these diseases probably have a multifactodal background. They both seem to have the same geographical and racial distribution: they have a higher incidence in regions with a temper-304 ate climate with an alleged North-South gradient (in Europe, it is 36.5/100.000 cases for CD and 68/100.000 for MS) and both are infrequent among Arabs and Africans, and frequent among Jews [10, 13, 20] . In terms of sex distribution, both have a higher incidence among females (1.15/1 for CD and 1.5/I for MS). Although they both affect a wide age range, the highest peak is around the second and third decade of age. Although these data suggest the possibility that environmental factors play a role in both diseases, nothing is known for sure about the responsible microbiological agents. As possible agents for MS, the scrapie agent and Herpes Simplex, Corona, HTLV1 and measles viruses [7] have all been proposed; for CD, paratubercolosis and clamidia [4, 12] organisms have been considered. The simultaneous infection of the CNS and the digestive tract by corona virus and picorna virus was described in 1983 in a murine model of MS [7] . A number of authors have supposed the presence of genetic predisposing factors for both diseases, and there are studies showing a familial association between chronic diseases of the bowel (especially CD) and MS [1 I, 21, 19] . It has also been hypothesised that one or more genetic loci may determine increased susceptibility to both pathologies; however, it doesn't seem that these include MHI genes. As a matter of fact, an association between CD and HLA B12 (B44) [6] has been verified, but haplotypes HLA A3, B7 and DR2 are more frequently found in MS patients [22] . In our case, immunogenetic analysis demonstrated HLA DR2 positivity, but HLA B/ was negative. Further immunological characteristics are shared by both diseases: 1) the presence of activated circulating lymphocytes (i.e. increased T helpers and a reduction of T suppressors) [22] ; 2) an increase in circulating IL-2 (often related to inflammatory bowel disease activity) [2] ; 3) an increase in circulating lymphocytes with IL-2 receptors [18] ; 4) an increase in circulating soluble IL-2 receptors [9] . Analogous patterns were observed within the lesion: an increase in T helper activated lymphocytes and the presence of cytochines (particularly gamma IFN). When used as a pharmacological agent, gamma interferon has proved to be a failure in MS, and even a worsening factor in CD [14] .",
