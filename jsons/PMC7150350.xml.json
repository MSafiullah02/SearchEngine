Bioaerosols can be comprised of bacterial cells and cellular fragments, fungal spores and fungal hyphae, viruses, and by-products of microbial metabolism. Pollen grains and other biological material can also be airborne as a bioaerosol. Microbial aerosols are generated in outdoor and indoor environments as a result of a variety of natural and anthroprogenic activities. Wind, rain and wave splash, spray irrigation, wastewater treatment activity, cooling towers and air handling water spray systems, and agricultural processes such as harvesting and tilling are examples of activities that generate bioaerosols outdoors. Indoors bioaerosols are generated and dispersed mechanical and human activity. Industrial and manufacturing practices and biofermentation procedures can generate high concentrations of microbial aerosols. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, water spray devices (e.g., showerheads and humidifiers), and cleaning (e.g., dusting, sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping) result in the transport of microbial materials in the air. Talking and coughing generate bioaerosols from individuals, some of which may be infectious. Facilities with medical, dental, or animal care practices can generate infectious microbial aerosols.",

Virus particles are nanometer in size, bacterial cells are approximately 1 \u03bcm in diameter, and fungal spores are  >1 \u03bcm. These microorganisms can be dispersed in the air as single units, but are often present as aggregate formations. The larger aggregates have different aerodynamic properties than single-cell units; therefore their dispersal may be different than single-unit particles. Aggregates of biological material also afford protection from environmental stresses such as desiccation, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation ozone and other pollutants in the atmosphere. Often bacterial cells and virus particles are associated with skin cells, dust, and other organic or inorganic material. During agricultural practices (e.g., during harvesting, and tilling), fungus spores are released from plant surfaces and the soil and raft on other particulate matter. This \u2018rafting\u2019 affects the aerodynamic characteristics and the survival of the cells in the bioaerosol. When biological material is dispersed from water sources (e.g., splash, rainfall, or cooling towers and fountains), it is generally surrounded by a thin layer of water. This moisture layer also changes the aerodynamic properties and aids in the survivability of the microorganisms while airborne.",

There are subtypes of influenza type A viruses based on two proteins on the surface proteins of the virus, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Many animals carry influenza A viruses, while influenza B viruses circulate among humans. Both influenza types A and B viruses cause epidemics of disease almost every winter. Influenza type C infections cause a mild respiratory illness and are not thought to cause epidemics. While symptoms can be mild, influenza may result in severe illness and death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that there are more than 200 000 hospital admissions and 36 000 deaths per year in the United States due to influenza. All ages can have serious illness from influenza, but those more likely to have complications are people aged 65 years and older, people with chronic medical conditions, and very young children. Transmission of influenza viruses is from person to person in respiratory droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing. The droplets are propelled usually less than 3 ft through the air and deposited on people in close proximity. Fomites contaminated with settled infectious droplets can also serve as a vehicle for transmission of influenza.",

The causative agent, Legionella pneumophila, is a vegetative Gram-negative bacterium that is ubiquitous in freshwater environments worldwide. It survives as an intercellular parasite of protozoa thereby resulting in protection for the bacterium while in the environment. Infective aerosols are generated from contaminated water spray devices such as showerheads, evaporative condensers, humidifiers, and fountains. Following the inhalation, L. pneumophila replicates in host macrophage resulting in severe pneumonia. While L. pneumophila accounts for the majority of disease cases caused by this genus, 19 other Legionella species are also human pathogens, often causing disease in immunosuppressed patients. Legionella bacteria that cannot replicate in the lung are cited as the cause of Pontiac fever, a mild flu-like syndrome. Often these organisms are released in aerosols from whirlpool tubs.

However, some infected individuals fail to recover and develop chronic pulmonary infection and permanent lung damage. Other individuals develop widespread disseminated infection that may involve the skin, bones, and genitourinary tract, and occasionally the meninges of the brain are affected. The mortality rate for blastomycosis is approximately 5%.",

Patients with T-cell deficiencies are the most susceptible to infection, and in the United States 85% of cases occur in HIV-infected persons. While the initial pulmonary infection is usually asymptomatic, cryptococcosis can cause serious symptoms of brain and spinal cord disease, such as headaches, dizziness, sleepiness, and confusion. Disseminated infection, especially meningoencephalitis, occurs in most patients.",

The exact nature of the infectious particles of C. neoformans is not known, but they are likely to be dehydrated yeast cells or basidiospores of the appropriate size range to be deposited in the lungs. Once in the lung, the yeast cells become rehydrated and acquire the characteristic polysaccharide capsule. Virulence of this organism is associated with the ability to produce the large capsule and shed great amounts of capsular material into the body fluids of the host.",
