All patients were treated with our standard protocol of broad-spectrum antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroid.9 Our 21-day steroid treatment protocol was as follows: IV methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg tid for 5 days; then 1 mg/kg bid for 5 days; then oral prednisolone, 0.5 mg/kg bid for 5 days; then 0.5 mg/kg/d for 3 days; and finally 0.25 mg/kg/d for 3 more days. In case of rapid clinical and radiologic deterioration, a course of pulsed methylprednisolone, 500 mg bid for 2 days, was administered as rescue therapy.9\n",

The spontaneous-timed mode was used for all patients, with a back-up rate of 12 breaths/min. Inspiratory positive airway pressure (iPAP) was adjusted to achieve respiratory rates of < 25 breaths/min and exhaled tidal volumes of at least 6 mL/kg. Expiratory positive airway pressure (ePAP) was adjusted to achieve target oxygenation with minimum carbon dioxide rebreathing. In order to decrease production of droplets, the following three strategies were implemented: (1) a facial mask was preferred to a nasal mask to decrease the leakage of air from the mouth; (2) a Whisper-Swivel II (Respironics) was used as the exhalation device, because compared with the jet outflow of the Whisper-Swivel I, its round-the-tube outflow may reduce the chance of jets of expired air from the patients with SARS contaminating the environment; and (3) a viral-bacterial filter (Airlife; Allegiance Healthcare; McGaw Park, IL) was placed before the exhalation device from March 21, 2003, onwards to decrease the viral bacterial load to the environment. Oxygen was connected to the mask, and the fraction of inspired oxygen was estimated from the oxygen flow rate and minute volume.12\n13\n",

Through installation of exhaust ventilation fans in each area to achieve negative pressure airflow, air changes were maintained at 8/h initially (before March 18, 2003) and later at > 12/h. Airflow was directed from the corridors outside the ward through the nursing station to patient areas and finally out to the atmosphere. Before mid-April 2003, personal protective equipment for all health-care workers included surgical or N-95 masks, protective eye wear, full-face shields, caps, gown with full sleeve coverage, surgical gloves, and shoe covers. After mid-April 2003, personal protective equipment during direct contact with patients receiving NIPPV was upgraded to an Air-Mate HEPA Powered Air Purifying Respirator System (3M Corporation; St. Paul, MN), which was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an interim domestic infection control for aerosol-generating procedures on patients with SARS.14 The Air-Mate HEPA Powered Air Purifying Respirator System is a device with face piece and hood that filters the surrounding air through a built-in high-efficiency particulate air filter before supplying to the user.",

Most patients with SARS and ARF were treated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.5\n6 In the present series, NIPPV was effective in preventing endotracheal intubation in 70% (14 of 20 patients). The efficacy of NIPPV may be attributed to early recruitment of the collapsed alveoli and resting of respiratory muscles while waiting for the action of pulsed corticosteroids to take effect. Since our patients who responded to NIPPV did so within 24 h, patients who would eventually need endotracheal intubation may thus be potentially identified early in the course of treatment. This finding is similar to the results of the use of NIPPV in other forms of ARF.15\n",

At the time of our planned randomized control study on NIPPV and endotracheal intubation in late April, SARS was already dying down in Hong Kong, and our last patient with SARS was clinically confirmed on April 28, 2003. To validate the effectiveness of NIPPV in SARS-related ARF, larger-scale prospective randomized control studies can be considered in the next outbreak. Our study also suffers from the low availability of pre-NIPPV blood gas results, which in conjunction with lack of multiorgan failure led to low APACHE II scores. However, the progression of respiratory failure was so fast that treatment decisions took precedence over blood work in this very infectious condition. From the level of oxygen requirement and corresponding oxygen saturation, all patients without blood gas data could fulfil the criteria for type 1 respiratory failure. Our study is also limited by the incomplete coronavirus serology for the 105 health-care workers, as three of the health-care workers refused to give consent for blood taking.",
