During the later selection cycles, the concentration of recombinant mouse KPNA2 was decreased to select high affinity RNA molecules. The RNA was briefly heated to 95 \u00b0C and then cooled to room temperature to form stable structures before the selection steps. In the selection cycles, tRNA (total tRNA from E. coli, Roche, Switzerland) was used as a non-specific competitor. After the RNA was incubated with mouse KPNA2 at room temperature for 10 min, the protein\u2013RNA complexes were filtered through a pre-wetted nitrocellulose acetate filter (HAWP filter, 0.45 \u00b5m, 13.0-mm, Merck Millipore, USA) fitted in a \u2018pop-top\u2019 filter holder (Nucleopore) and washed with 1 ml of RNA binding buffer. The RNAs that were retained on the filter were eluted and recovered as previously described (15, 16). The recovered RNAs were reverse-transcribed in 20 \u00b5l of a reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM spermidine, 10 mM DTT, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 0.4 \u00b5M primer and 25 U AMV reverse transcriptase (Wako, Japan). The nucleotides and enzymes were added after a denaturation and annealing step (2 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min). Reverse transcription was performed for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C. The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR and used as a template to obtain RNA for the next round of selection. For amplification of the cDNA by PCR, a 20 \u00b5l aliquot of the reverse transcription reaction (cDNA reaction mixture) was diluted in 80 \u00b5l of PCR reaction mixture [PrimeSTAR Max Premix (Takara, Japan) with 1 \u00b5M of each primer]. The reaction mixture was amplified using the following conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 20 s, 54 \u00b0C for 10 s and 72 \u00b0C for 20 s. This program was repeated for as many cycles as needed to produce a DNA band of the correct size. The PCR product was precipitated in ethanol and used for transcription. In vitro transcription was performed at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h with a T7 Ampliscribe kit (Epicentre Technologies). After treatment with DNase I, the reaction mixture was fractionated on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The RNA was extracted from the gel, quantified and used for the next cycle of selection and amplification. We manipulated each selection cycle to ensure specificity and high affinity of the KPNA2-bound molecules. For example, we modified the ratio of RNA:KPNA2, competitor concentrations (tRNA) and buffer volumes. To remove the filter binders, pre-filtration of the RNA pools were performed for each selection round. A total of eight selection cycles were carried out and the RNA pool from cycles 1, 3, 5 and 8 were evaluated for binding to the mouse KPNA2 protein.",

DNA was isolated from individual clones by the alkaline-lysis method and sequenced with a BigDye Terminator Sequencing kit (Life Technologies) on a DNA sequencer (Model 373A, Life Technologies). The secondary structures of the aptamers were predicted using the MFold program (20). To evaluate the mouse KPNA2 binding to the RNA pools from selection cycles 1, 3, 5 and 8 as well as the individual aptamers, internally labeled RNA was prepared using 0.5 mCi/ml [\u03b1-32P]ATP and binding experiments were performed using a filter binding assay similar to those previously reported (21). The binding and in vitro transcription conditions were similar to those used for selection, except for the RNA and mouse KPNA2 protein concentrations. For the evaluation of binding of RNA pools (from 1, 3, 5 and 8 selection cycles) to the mouse KPNA2 protein, we used 20 nM of labeled RNA and different concentration (490, 980 or 1960 nM) of mouse KPNA2. The RNA\u2013KPNA2 complexes retained on the filters were washed with 1 ml binding buffer and air dried and the radioactivity was quantified with an image analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Film, Japan). To ensure that the binding was specific, we performed binding assays in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of tRNA as a nonspecific competitor. Similarly, these RNA pools were also evaluated under similar conditions for their binding ability to another importin family subclass mouse KPNA1. Individual clones (aptamers 76, 72 and 21) binding ability to the mouse KPNA2 was evaluated using 25 nM of labeled RNA using [\u03b1-32P]ATP in the presence of 10-fold molar excess of tRNA and mouse KPNA2 protein (246, 492 and 984 nM). Next, to judge the importance of sequence of the above aptamers for binding, we carried out another filter binding assay using 25 nM of unselected pool RNA (containing random RNA sequences), in the presence of 10-fold tRNA and excess amount of mouse KPNA2 protein (490, 980 and 1960 nM). In order to estimate the equilibrium dissociation constants, we performed a filter binding assay using labeled aptamer RNA for either clone 72 or clone 76 (25 nM) in the presence of various concentrations (37, 74, 148, 296 and 592 nm) of mouse KPNA2. Additionally, aptamers 76 and 72 binding to the human KPNA2 was also evaluated by filter binding assay at different concentrations (37, 74, 148, 296 and 592 nM). The equilibrium dissociation constants were determined for all complexes (aptamer 76-mouse KPNA2, aptamer 76-human KPNA2, aptamer 72-mouse KPNA2, aptamer 72-human KPNA2) using a nonlinear regression algorithm in GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software).",

Initially, HeLa cells were cultured on an eight-well slide slip for two days in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were then permeabilized with digitonin and then the cytosolic components were washed out with transport buffer (20 mM HEPES\u2013KOH pH 7.3, 110 mM CH3COOK, 5 mM CH3COONa, 2 mM (CH3COO)2Mg, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 1 \u03bcg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin and leupeptin). Nuclear transport was established with 400 nM GST-SV40TAgNLS-GFP, 600 nM importin-\u03b2, 400 nM human KPNA2, 4 \u03bcM RanGDP, 350 nM NTF2, 0.5 mM GTP and an ATP regeneration system, at 37 \u00b0C for 8 min. To perform the same assay in the presence of the RNA aptamers (either 76 or 72) or pool RNA, we denatured the RNA in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl) and equilibrated for 10 min at room temperature. The renatured aptamers (at 5.0 \u03bcM final concentration) were pre-incubated with human KPNA2 at room temperature for 5 min prior to execution of the transport assay as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and observed by fluorescence microscopy. The quantitative analysis of transport efficiency was performed using Image J software (23) as follows: the mean value of the fluorescent signal inside the nucleus was measured and the signal intensity was calculated by normalizing with the mean value of the control cells. A total of 60 cells were randomly selected for each sample and the mean value with standard deviation was reported. To compare the specificity of the aptamers interference of nuclear transport mediated by different sub-class of importins, we performed the above assay by replacing the KPNA2 either with KPNA1 or KPNA3 proteins.",

            "text": "To select an RNA aptamer against KPNA2, random RNA pool over a 60-nucleotide stretch flanked by a fixed 37-nucleotide primer region at the 5\u2032 end and 20-nucleotide primer region at the 3\u2032 end was used. This randomized pool represents approximately 1014 different species under our experimental conditions. For the initial selection, the N-60 RNA pool (3.0 \u03bcM) and mouse KPNA2 (0.43 \u03bcM) were mixed and incubated for 10 min in the presence of buffering agents and the free RNA was separated from the mouse KPNA2\u2013RNA complexes by filtration. The mouse KPNA2 bound RNAs retained on the filter were recovered in a hot 7 M urea solution and subsequently amplified by reverse transcription, PCR and in vitro transcription. To enrich specific aptamers during the selection process, in each selection cycle, competition between the individual sequences was allowed. For this, a high RNA pool to target protein ratio was used in the initial selection cycles. In the subsequent selection cycles (2\u20138), the ratio between the mouse KPNA2 protein and RNAs (pool RNA and tRNA) was manipulated to increase the selection stringency (Table 1). To ensure selection of specific aptamers during the selection cycles, a non-specific competitor, tRNA, was used at different molar ratios. After eight rounds of selection cycles, RNA pools (1, 3, 5 and 8) were selected for the evaluation of enrichment of mouse KPNA2-binding aptamers and their specificity. The specificity and binding of RNA pools to the mouse KPNA2 was analyzed by filter binding assay at different concentrations (490, 980 and 1960 nM). The binding results show that the pool RNAs binding increased progressively with selection cycles and also the specificity to KPNA2, compared to the KPNA1 (Table 1). No significant retention of the selected RNA pool occurred on the filter in the absence of mouse KPNA2, indicating that the non-specific filter binders were not co-isolated during the selection process. Approximately 17% of the 8th RNA pool bound to mouse KPNA2 (Table 1). Since the 8th selection cycle RNA pool bound specifically to the mouse KPNA2, we proceeded to the cloning and sequencing steps to evaluate the sequences in the pool. Individual aptamers from the eight cycles were classified based on the sequence similarity. We observed that aptamer 76 represented 22% of the population, whereas aptamer 72 and aptamer 21 represented 4% and 2%, respectively, in the selected pool of cycle 8. The secondary structures of these aptamers were predicted according to the MFold program (20, Fig. 1a). Next, all three aptamers were evaluated with the filter assays for their binding ability to mouse KPNA2 (at concentrations of 246, 492 and 984 nM), in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of tRNA to avoid non-specific interactions with RNA. These filter binding assays showed that only aptamers 76 and 72 bound to mouse KPNA2, but aptamer 21 showed either minimal or insignificant binding to mouse KPNA1 (Fig. 1b). In order to clearly evaluate that the sequence of 76 and 72 would be important, we performed another binding assay with unselected pool RNA (containing random sequences) and found that the unselected RNA pool had no binding ability even in the excess amount of mouse KPNA2 protein (1960 nM, Fig. 1b). These binding analyses clearly suggest that the sequences of aptamers 76 and 72 are important for their affinity and specificity to the mouse KPNA2 and thus, all further studies were focused using these two aptamers.",

Both aptamers did not show any binding to mouse KPNA1, even at the highest concentration (576 nM, Fig. 2a). Mouse and human KPNA2 are highly conserved, with an amino acid similarity of 94.5% (Supplementary Fig. 3); thus, we hypothesized that these two aptamers would bind with equal efficiency to both mouse and human KPNA2.

We reasoned that if aptamer binding to human KPNA2 interferes with the binding of either importin-\u03b21 or GST-NLS-GFP (or both proteins), then there would be a lack of GFP accumulation in the cell nucleus (Fig. 3b). In a typical in vitro transport assay, cells with green fluorescence were observed when permeabilized cells were incubated for approximately 10 min with the ternary complex (Fig. 4a) and cells with no fluorescence were observed in the absence of the ternary complex (Fig. 4b). As predicted, in the presence of either the 76 or 72 aptamer (5 \u03bcM final concentration), the human KPNA2-dependent transport of cargo protein (GST-NLS-GFP) was significantly decreased, as determined by the decrease in the fluorescence of GFP positive cells (Fig. 4c and d).

To test whether the aptamers (76 and 72) would be able to interfere with this type of nuclear transport, we performed a similar experiment to the one described above, except that we replaced KPNA2 either with KPNA1 or KPNA3. Similarly, cells with green fluorescence were observed when permeabilized cells were incubated with a ternary complex composed of all three components (KPNA1, importin-\u03b21 and GST-NLS-GFP cargo) (Fig. 5a) and no fluorescent cells were observed in the absence of the ternary complex (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, the population of the GFP positive cells was not significantly affected by the presence of either the aptamers (76 and 72) or pool RNA (Fig. 5c\u2013e). Further, we have carried the nuclear transport assay with KPNA3 in the presence or absence of aptamers (76 and 72), or pool RNA. The permeabilized cells incubated with all three components (KPNA3, importin-\u03b21 and GST-NLS-GFP cargo) show green fluorescence cells (Fig. 6a) and no fluorescent cells were observed in the absence of the ternary complex (Fig. 6b). As observed in the case of KPNA1, the presence of aptamers, or pool RNA was also not affected the population of GFP positive cells (Fig. 6c\u2013e). To quantify this observed reduction of GFP fluorescence, we used Image J (NIH program) to measure the fluorescence resulting from any one of KPNA1-, KPNA2-, and KPNA3\u2013mediated nuclear transport. The GFP fluorescence intensity of a total of 60 cells was measured for all of the samples via random selection of cells. These analyses showed that in the presence of the aptamers (76 and 72), the GFP fluorescence intensity decreased by approximately 40% when KPNA2 was used for the nuclear transport (Fig. 7a). However, these two aptamers (76 and 72) and pool RNA had no effect on either KPNA1-dependent (Fig. 7b) or KPNA3-dependent (Fig. 7c) nuclear transport of cargo protein. The significant of quantitated data was statistically evaluated as shown in Fig. 7d.",

One of the key components of this transport system is importin \u03b1, which initiates the process by recognizing the NLS within the cargo and importing macro proteins into the nucleus through the nuclear pores, as mediated by importin-\u03b2. Currently, seven importin-\u03b1 proteins are grouped into three subfamilies. Despite their similarity, these proteins display remarkable specificity toward their cognate cargo proteins, which may decide the fate of the cell during differentiation, as observed in embryonic stem cells (9, 24). The divergent roles of importin-\u03b1 in the normal and in diseased cells scenarios have attracted much attention toward the development of ligands that specifically bind to a specific subfamily. In this study, we explored an in vitro selection strategy to identify aptamers from a completely random RNA pool that could bind specifically and efficiently as well as discriminate among subfamily members of importin-\u03b1. We executed a total of 8 selection cycles, which resulted in an enrichment of two aptamers, 76 and 72, as major and minor representation in the pool, respectively. These two aptamers bind efficiently (Kd \u2248 150 nM) to KPNA2-derived from either mouse or human. Moreover, both clones failed to bind to KPNA1 (Fig. 2b). The secondary structure predictions suggest that these two aptamers are not related to each other.",

            "text": "Because these two aptamers bound to the human KPNA2 specifically, an in vitro nuclear transport assay was used to evaluate whether the selected aptamers interfered with human KPNA2-mediated nuclear transport. Our analyses showed that ability of human KPNA2 to transport the cargo protein (GST-NLS-GFP) decreased by about 40% in the presence of either aptamer 76 or aptamer 72 (Fig. 6a). The efficiency of interference for these two clones was observed to be the same, correlating well with their affinity towards human KPNA2. However, under similar conditions, random RNA sequences (pool RNA) showed no effects on nuclear transport activity mediated either by KPNA1 or KPNA2, or KPNA3, suggesting that the negatively charged surface of the aptamers had no major roles in binding to KPNA proteins. Nevertheless, structural analyses of the aptamer-KPNA2complex may reveal the specific binding site and shed light on their interference with KPNA2-mediated nuclear transport. Interestingly, both aptamers failed to interfere neither the KPNA1-mediated nor KPNA3-mediated nuclear transport of cargo protein. Taken together these results suggest that the selected aptamers 76 and 72 are able to discriminate efficiently and block specifically the human KPNA2-mediated nuclear transport (that belongs to the sub-family of importin\u2013\u03b11) from KPNA1 (that belongs to the subfamily of importin\u2013\u03b12) or KPNA3 (that belongs to the subfamily of importin\u2013\u03b13) (Figs 4\u20136).",

Importantly, both aptamers efficiently and specifically interfered with KPNA2-mediated nuclear transport. We believe that these selected aptamers will have useful applications as new reagents for cancer diagnosis because many cancer cells and tissues are known to overexpress KPNA2 (10\u201312). In addition, these aptamers may aid in modulating the specific nuclear transport system mediated by KPNA2; if these aptamers were delivered into the cytoplasm by fusion with internalizing aptamers (25, 26), they would probably be internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis.",
