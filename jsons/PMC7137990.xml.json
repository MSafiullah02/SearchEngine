Although during the Hajj, pilgrims visit the holy cities Makkah and Medina, Saudi Arabia, the strict definition of Hajj only applies to the pilgrimage to Makkah.

The public health measures for Hajj are focused on provision of safe water and food supplies, sanitation, vector control, pre-travel health regulations and advice about vaccinations, health checks, and specific immunisation at the port of entry, health education campaigns, and provision of free health care to pilgrims through several clinics and hospitals. A proactive public health programme is initiated before each Hajj, with focus on prevention and surveillance of health hazards, and health-care provision during the pilgrimage. Before each Hajj, the Saudi Ministry of Health disseminates the health requirements for issuance of travel visas, and provides advice about public health guidelines to prevent the spread of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.21, 22, 23, 24, 25 This advice is re-enforced with widespread health education and prevention campaigns through reading materials, travel agents, pilgrims' group leaders, and media communication during the Hajj.",

The Saudi Government's success in alert and response planning for infectious diseases is attributable to a multidisciplinary group of experts from various government sectors who are involved in the advance planning of health services, logistical support, and communications for the Hajj. Continuous monitoring of emerging infectious diseases ensures that, for example, infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in an individual28 is not transmitted to other pilgrims, thereby avoiding a worldwide epidemic. The Saudi Government coordinates the Hajj activities through a supreme committee and 24 subcommittees for the Hajj.16, 19 For Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013, the three key planning considerations by the Saudi Government for communicable disease alert and response during the pilgrimage, based on WHO's recommendations for communicable disease alert and response during mass gatherings,29 were risk assessment of what might happen during the Hajj, proactive surveillance for communicable diseases especially because of outbreaks of MERS-CoV and other viral diseases, and response and action. Additionally, input about outbreak management and emerging diseases is provided by WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, UK's Public Health England, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the Saudi Public Health Directorate of the Ministry of Health. Thus, a major global effort is needed to maintain the highest level of public health services and increased risk awareness of infectious diseases during the Hajj.",

However, no major outbreaks have occurred at the Hajj as shown by the results of a cohort study of French pilgrims in 2012.50 In 2009, fewer than 100 cases of influenza A H1N1 were reported during Hajj at the peak of the pandemic, and only 26 confirmed cases during Umrah.51 In another study, no influenza A H1N1 infection was detected in 559 pilgrims.52 The results of this study, however, showed rapid infection with respiratory viruses and bacteria, particularly rhinovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The Saudi Ministry of Health is assessing vaccines for prevention of pneumococcal infections.53 The ministry is also in the process of defining the exact burden of pneumococcal sepsis (pneumonia, meningitis, or invasive disease) during Hajj.53 Pneumococcal vaccines (polyvalent), specifically for people older than 65 years and those with splenectomy, are available. Additionally, other forms of prevention are widely available and are known to reduce the burden of disease associated with S pneumoniae. Although the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination for the prevention of S pneumoniae infections in elderly pilgrims is yet to be ascertained, these individuals might benefit from vaccination with the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine for the common pneumococcal serotypes that are circulating during Hajj.",

Since the first case report of MERS-CoV infection, the Saudi Government and other governments in the Middle East have continued proactive surveillance with immediate reporting of cases of MERS-CoV infection to WHO. Increased surveillance during Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013 was achieved with a MERS-CoV response team monitoring and gathering data at all clinics and hospitals in Arafat, Makkah, Mina, Muzdalifah, and Medina.",

The Saudi surveillance data for invasive meningococcal disease showed a reduction in the number of Hajj-related cases and non-Hajj-related cases after the introduction of the ACYW vaccine in 2002.63 Continued surveillance with yearly analysis of data is necessary to bring about the adaptation of public health measures and avoid future epidemics of invasive meningococcal disease during the Hajj in subsequent years.

Additionally, infectious diseases pose a threat to global health security and show the importance of planning, communication, and public health surveillance and response at these religious events. Saudi Arabia has much experience of providing health care during religious mass gatherings through decades of managing millions of pilgrims who undertake Hajj. The formation of the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine and its network will serve as a unique platform for providing a research evidence base and for sharing knowledge about the safeguarding and improvement of the health of attendees at mass gatherings.",
