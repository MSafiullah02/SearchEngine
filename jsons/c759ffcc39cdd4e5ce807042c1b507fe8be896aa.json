            "text": "Parasitic Crustacea have been present in scientific literature since Linnaeus introduced the first classification system (binomial nomenclature). Crustaceans are considered to be the most morphologically diverse arthropods, with currently 19 parasitic orders known to science. This chapter reviews the history of discovery for each of the major parasitic Crustacea groups, highlighting some of the key developments that have influenced our current understanding of these parasites. Each taxonomic group is briefly introduced, followed by a synopsis on some of the outstanding contributions within that group. Knowledge development is followed, from the first parasites discovered to other historical highlights that influenced the groups up to this point. Other important discoveries (both taxonomic and ecological) are also noted, serving as a preview to the host-parasite interactions covered in the subsequent chapters. Additionally, several researchers who have added significant contributions to our knowledge of the parasitic Crustacea (specifically in taxonomy and discovery) are introduced, along with photographs of a select few. This historical review of the crustacean parasites provides a background to these diverse and abundant organisms and will contribute to a better understanding of their unique niche in the aquatic environment.",

            "text": "Historically, crustacean collections were held in private collections or university museums. Collections from oceans were restricted to the intertidal regions or ship based, and for obvious reasons discovery lagged behind terrestrial discovery. The age of great ocean expeditions that fed into fish parasite knowledge included amongst others the US Exploring Expedition (several ships, 1838-1842), the Galathea Expedition (Danish, 1845 (Danish, -1847 and the Siboga Expedition (Dutch, 1899 (Dutch, -1900 . As scientific research developed, state (national) museums were founded as the major repositories for all natural history collections, such as the British Museum (founded in 1753 and the first national public museum in the world), the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle (1793) and in the New World, the US National Museum (1846), to name just three. As technology improved, scientists were able to use new techniques to not only collect parasites (such as SCUBA diving) but also to view them (such as scanning electron microscopy [SEM] and differential interference contrast [DIC] microscopy). Currently, the use of molecular biology techniques for parasites is on the rise. These techniques can assist with parasite identification and characterisation, as well as provide other useful information on the parasite origin and evolution (amongst other things).",

It is envisaged that understanding the past research will indicate the gaps in our knowledge within these groups and contribute to identifying where research should focus in the future. The chapter focused primarily on the taxonomic and systematic discovery of parasitic crustaceans, along with notes on selected contributors to our knowledge of parasitic Crustacea. It should be noted that the chapter is not intended to be a checklist and does not refer to every researcher who has worked on the parasitic Crustacea.",

Amphipods associated with other animals are frequently referred to as commensals (i.e. members of Leucothoidae are typically found associated with sessile invertebrates such as sponges, utilising the current produced by the sponge to feed).

            "text": "As cyamids are permanently attached to constantly moving cetaceans, in-depth studies on the parasites have been difficult; however, despite these challenges, many scientists have been able to report on their ecology. Juan Antonio Balbuena and Juan Antonio Raga published many papers on parasites of marine mammals and discussed the ecology and host relationships of whale lice on pilot whales (Balbuena and Raga 1991). Furthermore, Victoria Rowntree, an American whale researcher, has noted many behavioural aspects of these amphipods (on right whales in particular). Cyamids are known to aggregate in areas where there is the least amount of stress (out of the main water flow areas), such as the skin folds on the head, eyes, flippers, blowholes, lip margins, around barnacles and callosities (Leung 1970a, b; Rowntree 1996) . The abundance of the cyamids on their host is inversely proportional to the host's swimming speed, with slower whales having several thousand on a single host and faster-swimming dolphins having fewer . The mouthparts of the cyamids are highly modified, with setae and short spines on the maxillae, maxillules and mandibles, for excavating and eating host skin. Rowntree (1996) confirmed that these ectoparasites eat whale skin containing pigments (seen in the intestines of the amphipods), and shortly thereafter Schell et al. (2000) confirmed this diet with the aid of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. More recently, Rowntree and colleagues have used genetic sequence variation in the whale lice of right whales in order to determine population histories (Kaliszewska et al. 2005) . Carl J. Pfeiffer, researcher of marine mammals, and his colleagues provided additional information on the anatomy of cyamids (marsupium, eggs, juveniles and cuticle) (Pfeiffer and Viers 1998) , as well as on the ocular musculature (Levin and Pfeiffer 1999) . Pfeiffer also completely revised the whale lice in a chapter dedicated to the crustaceans in the published book Encyclopaedia of Marine Mammals (Pfeiffer 2002) .",

Many observations of living hyperiids were also made by Philippe Laval (from 1963 until he retired in 2004) ( Fig. 2.1i ). Laval was one of the first researchers to recognise that all hyperiids have a parasitic way of life (noted in his doctoral thesis in 1974), which was later confirmed by Harbison et al. (1977) and published (amongst others) an extensive paper on these parasites associated with gelatinous zooplankton (Laval 1980) .",

Barnard was an outstanding amphipod taxonomist, primarily working on the Gammaridea. Years later, Vinogradov (1991) published a key for the genus in Russian. In 2004, Freire and Serejo (2004) provided a key to the Brazilian species and recorded the first Trischizostoma from the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. A recent publication by Winfield et al. (2017) added the first record from the north-east Pacific. The distribution of these two groups now is as follows: the \"entire telson\" group are known from the north-east and south-west Atlantic Ocean, the north-west and north-east Pacific Ocean and the Indo-Pacific, while the \"notched telson\" group are from the south-east Atlantic and south-west Indian Ocean (Winfield et al. 2017 ).",

Four of these species are parasitic: Aega psora and Anilocra physodes are external attaching parasites, while Cymothoa oestrum and C. scopulorum are found in the buccal cavity of various fish species. Cymothoa Fabricius, 1793, is recognised as the first unequivocally fish parasitic isopod genus.",

Leach, who was one of the world's leading crustacean experts at that time and friend to both Cuvier and Lamarck (great naturalists of the time), established the parasitic families Cymothoidae and Gnathiidae. Furthermore, Leach also described 25 genera, eight of which are fish parasitic (six still valid), and 36 species between 1775 and 1818. Sadly, there is reportedly no known portrait of Leach (Harrison and Smith 2008) . However, what is arguably the most memorable fact about Leach is his interesting play on the name Caroline/Carolina in nine acronymic isopod genera in 1818: Anilocra Leach, 1818; Canolira Leach, 1818; Cirolana Leach, 1818; Conilera Leach, 1818; Livoneca Leach, 1818, Nelocira Leach, 1818; Nerocila Leach, 1818; Olencira Leach, 1818; and Rocinela Leach, 1818. It is believed that this was in reference to Queen Caroline of Britain (estranged wife of the Prince of Wales) and was a repetitive insult to the woman who was described as an \"unlovable adulteress\" (see Bruce 1995) . Around the same time these cymothoids were being discovered, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque (a French polymath) founded the family Bopyridae.",

Cyproniscids and cabiropsids are parasitic on free-living isopods and Podasconidae are parasites of amphipods. In the Cryptoniscidae, genera such as Danalia Giard, 1887, and Liriopsis Schultze in M\u00fcller, 1859 , are hyperparasitic on rhizocephalan cirripedes, which parasitise crustaceans such as the false king crab (Peresan and Roccatagliata 2005) . Limited information is available on the monogeneric family Tridentellidae, but the mouthparts appear to be well adapted for rasping and piercing into fish host tissues (Bruce 1984) . Barybrotidae is a monotypic genus, with the only known species Barybrotes indus Schioedte & Meinert, 1879 recorded from the gills of the devil ray Mobula mobular (Bonnaterre, 1788) (previously Mobula diabolus) (see Moreira and Sadowsky 1978) . The Aegidae and Corallanidae are temporary parasites as they often leave the host after their blood meal, but more frequently, these isopods have been classed as free-living micropredators (Brusca 1983; Bruce 1993 Bruce , 2004 Bruce , 2009 ).

The first recognisable drawing of a gnathiid was made by a Dutch zoologist, Slabber (1769), who drew a larval form and was uncertain as to which family the strange isopod belonged. The first adult male, Gnathia maxillaris (Montagu, 1804) (described as Cancer maxillaris), was described a few decades later by Montagu, who then went on to describe the first gnathiid larva found feeding on a fish host (Montagu 1804 (Montagu , 1813 . Due to the unique appearance of this isopod, Leach (1814) established a new genus, Gnathia Leach, 1814. However, there was plenty of confusion regarding the appearance of three very different life forms (the adults, the swollen praniza larvae and the smaller zuphea larvae), which led researchers to believe that they were separate species (Risso 1816; Bate 1858) . It was by accident that Hesse (1864) established the link between the different forms while keeping a praniza in water to sketch when it moulted into an adult. Forty years later, the first life cycle of a gnathiid, Gnathia maxillaris, was described by Smith (1904) . This was the first account of the different life stages and development of these isopods, and Smith was able to observe that the adult stages do not feed.",

They are diverse in morphology, biology and host range, and both the juvenile and adults are parasitic on echinoderms (excluding regular urchins and sea cucumbers) and cnidarians (e.g. corals, gorgonians, zoanthids) (Grygier and H\u00f8eg 2005) . Ascothoracida is one of the three infraclasses of Thecostraca and Kentrogonida (see Table 2 .1) and has approximately 107 known species in 6 families and 23 genera (Ahyong et al. 2011) .",

Most of the information gathered was from Russian articles that were largely inaccessible to the western world at that time. Only nine genera were listed in the infraclass in the 1970s; thereafter, research on the group was focused on taxonomy, with majority of the new genera and species being described in the 1980s. However, since 2000, only one new ascothoracid species has been recorded, Gorgonolaureus helenae Kolbasov, 2004. Most of the earlier studies on ascothoracids were primarily taxonomic and morphologically based; however, information regarding their ecology and life stages was also available in several publications. The adult stages of these parasites are striking and have distinguishing characteristics for easier species identification; however, the larval forms often need to be reared into adults in a laboratory before they can be identified. Studies on the larval stages became important, especially with the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) as utilised by It\u00f4 and Grygier (1990) on Baccalaureus falsiramus (It\u00f4 and Grygier 1990) . Later Grygier (1992) reported on rearing larvae and their development, and most recently, Kolbasov et al. (2008a) thoroughly studied the external morphology of the first and second a-cyprid larvae.",

Mark Joseph Grygier ( Fig. 2 .5e), an American based in Japan, is currently one of the world's leading experts on Ascothoracida and one of the most prolific authors on this group. Grygier has described 10 new ascothoracid genera as well as 51 new species (almost half of the known species in the infraclass). Grygier (1981) reviewed the sperm of Dendrogaster Knipovich, 1890, and determined that it was the most primitive sperm discovered in Crustacea (Grygier 1981) . Two years later, he separated the crinoid-infecting Waginella Grygier, 1983, from Synagoga Norman, 1888, which disrupted the subordinal classification suggested by Wagin, which was based on the phylum of the host (Grygier 1983) . The classification of the Ascothoracida was then updated by Grygier (1987) , who divided the group into two orders and six families. A few years later Grygier (1996) completed a rare demographic study on a deep-sea parasite Parascothorax synagogoides Wagin, 1964 , parasitising the brittlestar Ophiophthalmus normani (Lyman, 1879) (see Grygier 1991) , and in 1996, he published a comprehensive account of the Ascothoracida (Grygier 1996) .",

They are sessile as adults, with motile larval stages, and in intertidal rocky shores form the recognisable \"barnacle zone\". Barnacles are known to be both parasites and commensals (occurring in sponges as well as on corals, whales, etc.) and can act as castrating parasites of crabs (family Sacculinidae).",

Charles Darwin (Fig. 2.6a) noticed it was very similar to Cryptophialus Darwin, 1854 but placed into Alcippe Hancock, 1849 (now Trypetesa Norman, 1903 ) (see Darwin 1854) . In 1872, Noll placed both Alcippe and Cryptophialus into Darwin's order Abdominalia. In 1905, Gruvel realised that the cirri on the terminal body segments thought to be abdominal appendages (hence the order's name) was in fact from the thorax, so the order was changed to Acrothoracica. Around the same time, Norman (1903) changed the genus name from Alcippe to Trypetesa, as the former name was preoccupied (homonym) by birds in the family Pellorneidae. Jack Tomlinson (Fig. 2.6b) , who was recognised as one of the world authorities of this group, revised the burrowing barnacles known at that time, including information on all of the different systems, taxonomy and ecology (Tomlinson 1969 (Tomlinson , 1987 . More recently there have been many studies on the larvae as well as phylogeny and systematics of this group by Gregory Kolbasov (Fig. 2.6c ) and colleagues (Kolbasov 2002 Kolbasov et al. 2014) , as well as the phylogenetic relationships of the different barnacle orders (Lin et al. 2016) .

Trypetesa lampas, removed from ovigerous female hosts, were found to contain hermit crab eggs, chorions, as well as yolk in their gut. There is still uncertainty surrounding how these barnacles feed, but this research documented how they can have significant negative effects on hermit crab reproduction. Other studies have showed blue-green algae-like particles in the gut of Trypetesa lampas (see Kamens 1981) , and it may be that barnacles in male hermit crabs filter feed on particles from the water, whereas barnacles in females feed on the hermit crab eggs (Williams et al. 2011 ). Murphy and Williams (2013) verified this study and suggested that the more accurate term for these barnacles may be \"transient parasites\" as they can be harmful in some cases but cause no harmful impact in other cases. Larsen et al. (2016) added that the barnacles do not rely on the egg predation to any substantial degree and found much of the data they collected on prevalence, load, reproductive cycles, and host relationships differed from previous studies. This highlighted the fact that there is still a lot of work to be done on these barnacles before we fully understand their ecology.",

They are endoparasites of other crustaceans, especially decapods. Currently there are 2 orders, 11 families, 41 genera and 288 species known. The adult females have lost most of the traits usually associated with Crustacea and are also known to influence the morphology and biology of their hosts which sets them apart from other groups. These adult female parasitic barnacles consist of an \"externa\" (an external sac-like body for reproduction) and an \"interna\" (a root-like body inside the host for nutrient uptake), with the male inside the female externa, joined by a small stalk (H\u00f8eg 1995; H\u00f8eg and L\u00fctzen 1995) . Many rhizocephalans are known to cause parasitic sterilisation or castration of their crustacean hosts. Depending on the species, these parasites can lower reproductive outputs, cause eggs to die within a few days or completely inhibit gonad processes required for reproduction (H\u00f8eg 1995) . Along with the degeneration of the gonads, rhizocephalans can also cause feminisation of male hosts. This may include testes converting to ovaries, changes in the overall shape and size of the hosts and possibly even changing the behaviour of the host (H\u00f8eg 1995) .",

Unfortunately, the parasite is not host specific, and it could spread if it were introduced as a control agent (Murphy and Goggin 2000) . This was put to the test by Goddard et al. (2005) . Four native North American crab species were infected with the European green crab's natural parasite, Sacculina carcini Thompson, 1836. Although the parasite preferred the green crab, there were still a significant number of native crabs infected (all without producing a reproductive sac) which would result in the loss of many indigenous species.",

Only two genera were originally thought to be parasitic, namely, the monotypic genus Anelasma Darwin, 1851, comprising Anelasma squalicola (Lov\u00e9n, 1844) , and Rhizolepas Day, 1939 (with two species, R. annelidicola Day, 1939, and R. gurjanovae Zevina, 1968 ).

Although this species was described many decades ago, it has rarely been studied. It was first noted by Gunnerus (1763) on the velvet belly lantern shark, Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758), but he did not name or adequately describe it. This paper was largely overlooked by researchers, and only a decade later did the Swedish marine zoologist Sven Ludvig Lov\u00e9n (Fig. 2.6f ) (1844) formally describe it as \"Alepas squalicola\". Shortly thereafter, Charles Darwin ( Fig. 2.6a ) realised in his monographic review of barnacles (Darwin 1851 ) that the species was in the wrong genus and assigned it to his new genus, Anelasma. Recently, the feeding strategy of this species was analysed to determine if the barnacle is purely parasitic or is still capable of using suspension feeding to obtain nutrition (Ommundsen et al. 2016) . The authors concluded that the barnacle uses the host exclusively as a food source using a de novo evolved feeding mechanism. Other noteworthy publications on A. squalicola include the phylogenetic analysis of these barnacles (Rees et al. 2014) , as well as studies that it causes retarded growth in the shark reproductive organs (Yano and Musick 2000) .",

No other species were described until 1991 when Mark Grygier (Fig. 2.5e ) and William Anderson Newman (Fig. 2.6g ) added another genus and two new species to this group of parasites (Grygier and Newman 1991) . Although their method of feeding has not been thoroughly studied, these barnacles cause detrimental effects to their host. Grignard and Jangoux (1994) concluded that the barnacles inhibited the growth of the urchin spine upon which it attaches. The thoracopods are not used for filter-feeding, and it is unlikely that they scavenge, so it is possible that much of their food is obtained from host tissue (Grygier and Newman 1991) .",

This parasite, Basipodella harpacticola Becker, 1975 , was incorrectly placed into the subclass Copepoda. , Deoterthron Bradford & Hewitt, 1980 , was discovered parasitising ostracods in New Zealand (Bradford and Hewitt 1980) . Bradford and Hewitt (1980) noticed that the two genera were closely related but considered them to belong with the Cirripedia rather than the Copepoda. Grygier (1983) noted that although he agreed these species belonged in the then \"Maxillopoda\" (now Oligostraca and Multicrustacea), they did not fit in either the Copepoda or Cirripedia. In resolving this uncertainty, Geoffrey Allan Boxshall (Fig. 2.6h) and Roger J. Lincoln (1983) proposed a new class, Tantulocarida, with the two genera Basipodella Becker, 1975 and Deoterthron, distinct but of similar rank to the Cirripedia and Copepoda.",

They are known to be free-living, symbiotic (or \"associates\") and parasitic. Those that are parasitic are known to infect a large range of hosts (almost every phylum), from sponges and echinoderms to fish and mammals. Parasitic copepods are usually found on the external surfaces of their hosts, often sheltered in microhabitats such as the gills, nostrils, mantle cavities and genital folds, but there are some that are endoparasites, occurring in the muscles, digestive tracts and body cavities of their hosts (Huys and Boxshall 1991) .",

It looked like a \"grub\" and was found next to the fins, resembling a scorpion in shape, and the size of a spider. Over the years, various researchers have pondered on what parasite is referred to in this text, possibly isopods or branchiurans; however, based on the descriptive traits given, it is believed to be a copepod (Damkaer 2002) . Aristotle also mentioned \"sea lice\" found on the red mullet, devoid of blood and with a flat tail, and that most likely refers to branchiurans.",

Damkaer (Fig. 2.7d) , is a compilation of early copepod history and the 90 researchers whose work contributed to the advancement of copepod knowledge from 350 BC to 1832 (Damkaer 2002) . It includes detailed information on the copepodologists, with historic portraits and illustrations, and a thorough history of discovery for the copepods. This was the first of a projected three volumes in the series, with the second detailing the research up to the nineteenth century (currently in production), with an overlap of the third publication which will include the Golden Age of Copepodology and conclude with research completed up to approximately 1950 (Damkaer 2002) .

Kabata was a world-renowned fish parasitologist and one of the pioneers of research into fish parasitology and diseases. He was born in Poland, and his fascination with marine science began while working as a deckhand on a North Sea trawler out of Aberdeen. Kabata became internationally recognised as the world's copepod expert with 159 publications (including his books Parasitic Copepoda of British Fishes and Parasites and Diseases of Fish Cultured in the Tropics) (Kabata 1979 (Kabata , 1985 describing 20 new genera and more than 100 new species. His work on this group has been acknowledged by other researchers in this field through patronymy of 22 taxa, the most memorable of which must be the copepod genus and species Bobkabata kabatabobbus Hogans & Benz, 1990. Currently, two of the most recognised names in copepodology are Geoffrey Allan Boxshall (Fig. 2.6h) and Rony Huys (Fig. 2.6i ) (British and Belgian zoologists respectively) from the Natural History Museum, London. Both researchers have made noteworthy contributions to other parasitic crustacean groups, but their copepod publications have formed the foundation for many of the subsequent studies in this group and have established themselves as world leading authorities on copepods (Huys and Boxshall 1991; Boxshall and Halsey 2004; Huys 2009 ). Boxshall has been involved in the naming of 338 taxa (of which 317 are still valid). Those copepod taxa that are in use include a new infraclass, a new order, 16 families, a subfamily, 67 genera and 231 species. Likewise, Huys has named 334 taxa of which 308 are still valid, including a new infraclass, a new order, 16 families and 2 subfamilies, 128 genera, 2 subgenera, 157 species and a subspecies. In fact, both of these copepodologists have named genera after each other in honour of their extraordinary work in this group of crustaceans, namely, Boxshallia Huys, 1988, and Huysia Jaume, Boxshall & Iliffe, 1998.

The first two cyclopoids were described by Carl Linnaeus (Fig. 2.1a) , namely, Cyclops quadricornis quadricornis (Linnaeus, 1758) and Lernaea cyprinacea Linnaeus, 1758 . Cyclops M\u00fcller, 1785 , is one of the most common freshwater copepod genera with approximately 200 valid species. It belongs to the family Cyclopidae, which is the largest cyclopoid family with over 1100 valid species. Members of this family are predominantly free-living; however, several species are intermediate hosts for numerous pathogenic human and fish parasites such as Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis (Linnaeus, 1758) ), as well as cestodes (tapeworms) and nematodes (round worms) (Piasecki et al. 2004) . Recently, Eucyclops bathanalicola Boxshall & Strong, 2006 was described from Lake Tanganyika in a rare occurrence of a freshwater copepod parasitic on an invertebrate host (mantle cavity of Bathanalia straeleni Leloup, 1953) . This association is also noteworthy as it also represents a unique account of a parasite in what is primarily a free-living family (Boxshall and Strong 2006) .",

            "text": "The second cyclopoid species discovered by Linnaeus belongs to the genus Lernaea Linnaeus, 1758, a widely known genus of freshwater fish parasites, commonly referred to as anchor worms. Lernaea cyprinacea was originally described from Europe in 1745 under a trinomial name but was then redescribed by Linnaeus in 1758 (see Kabata 1979) . Anchor worms burrow into the skin of its host fish and can cause a disease called lernaeosis where haemorrhagic ulcers occur at the attachment site. Death of the host can occur due to secondary infections and severe bleeding (Khalifa and Post 1976; Kabata 1985) . This species has been recorded worldwide and is thought to have been spread through the movement of aquarium species (Innal and Oldewage 2012) . The family Lernaeidae is probably one of the most studied cyclopoid groups due to its importance in aquaculture. Lernaea spp. have been reported to cause mass mortalities as early as 1880. According to Kocy\u0142owski and Mi\u0105czy\u0144ski (1960) , lernaeosis almost demolished an entire population of crucian carp in the Masurian Lake District (Poland) in 1880. An interesting case of catfish mortality due to gill damage (including epithelial hyperplasia, telangiectasis and haemorrhage) caused by Lernaea cyprinacea was also noted in Arkansas by Goodwin (1999) . Bighead carp in the same tanks, with approximately the same number of copepods externally, did not die. Fish mortalities due to gill damage from Lernaea copepodids had never been reported before. This was most likely due to the polyculturing of the catfish with the bighead carp (an excellent host for Lernaea) and the filter-feeding apparatus of the carp preventing large infestations on their gill filaments.",

One genus, Balaenophilus Aurivillius, 1879 (with three species), known to occur on the external surfaces of turtles, whales and manatees, appears to be both epibionts and parasites. Kazunari Ogawa and colleagues recorded the first copepod on a sea turtle and noticed the turtle's skin inside the gut, which led the authors to the conclusion that the copepods feed on the turtle and not algae or diatoms (Ogawa et al. 1997 ). According to Badillo et al. (2007) , there was definite evidence of Balaenophilus ingesting whale and sea turtle host tissue; however, the extent of this on the host is unknown. Mild signs of a tissue reaction was also observed in turtles with large numbers of copepods present at one time (>500). However, when Su\u00e1rez-Morales et al. (2010) confirmed the presence of these copepods on manatees, they could not see any effect on the hosts. Healthy skin was observed at the site of attachment when Balaenophilus manatorum (Ort\u00edz, Lalana & Torres, 1992) was removed, and no difference was seen in their reproduction or behaviour. Thus, their status as parasites remains unclear at this point.",

Juvenile Genesis vulcanoctopusi L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez, Bresciani & Huys, 2000 , however, were located within the connective tissue of the octopod integument, indicating the possibility that these parasites may have both endo-and ectoparasitic phases (L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2000 ). The first species described from this family was Tisbe furcata (Baird, 1837). Arthur Grover Humes listed specimens labelled as T. furcata from the mantle of Ocnus planci (Brandt, 1835) , a sea cucumber (see Humes 1980) ; however, the identification was by Monticelli in 1892 and is doubtful.

According to Mexican marine biologist and researcher, Eduardo Su\u00e1rez-Morales (Fig. 2.7f ) (2011), the first reported monstrilloid was from a Norwegian fjord in 1842 (Kr\u00f8yer 1842) . A single preadult specimen of Monstrilla typica (Kr\u00f8yer, 1849) (originally named Thaumatoessa typica in the 1842 publication) was illustrated by Kr\u00f8yer but without any description. This description was only provided in 1849 (with a slight alteration to the original name), along with the diagnosis of a new genus (Kr\u00f8yer 1849) . The monstrilloid naupliar stage was first described by Giesbrecht (1893), shortly followed by the drawings and descriptions of the nauplius and development of the endoparasites of Haemocera by Malaquin (1901) . In 1994, Grygier re-examined the \"Thaumatoessa (Thaumaleus) typica\" type specimen in order to determine its identity and moved it into the genus Monstrilla Dana, 1849. Shortly thereafter, Grygier (1995) published an annotated chronological bibliography of the Monstrilloida.",

Until recently, eight genera were considered valid, but Mark Joseph Grygier (Fig. 2 .5e) and Susumu Ohtsuka (2008) Most of the species within Monstrilloida have been described by Eduardo Su\u00e1rez-Morales (Fig. 2.7f ) and colleagues (75 valid taxa), including a single genus, 73 species and 1 subspecies. The systematic position of this order however is still unclear. According to Huys et al. (2007) , Monstrilloida fall within a fish parasitic clade of the Siphonostomatoida, sharing a common ancestor with caligiform families. However, this is considered unconfirmed by some researchers, and more information is required before any definitive changes in classification can be made (Su\u00e1rez-Morales 2011). The original status of the Monstrilloida therefore remains as is at this stage (Su\u00e1rez-Morales and McKinnon 2014).",

The first described species for this order was the ectoparasite Lernentoma asellina (Linnaeus, 1758) , an uncommon parasite found in the gills of gurnards from the family Triglidae. This copepod is from the family Chondracanthidae that was revised by Ju-shey Ho, from California State University, Long Beach. Ho's work on symbiotic copepods has exceeded 257 publications on these crustaceans from around the world. In 1970 and 1971, Ho revised the Chondracanthidae (when it still was in the order Cyclopoida) in order to clarify the confusion surrounding these crustacean's identification, re-examining and redescribing every specimen and verifying its identity. At the time, only 30 genera were known; however, there are now 51 known genera in this family containing 193 species and 4 subspecies. Recently, \u00d8stergaard et al. (2003) used phylogenetic analyses to determine the phylogeny within the family, which clarified some of the questions regarding past and present subfamilies of Chondracanthidae.",

They are usually deeply embedded inside their host with only the distal urosome and egg sacs visible (Uyeno and Nagasawa 2012) . Currently, there are 6 genera and 31 species within the family. The first two described species were Lomanoticola brevipes (Hancock & Norman, 1863) and Splanchnotrophus gracilis Hancock & Norman, 1863. Another family, Ergasilidae, comprises fish parasitic copepods, where only the females are parasitic. Most species are found in freshwater and most attach to the host gills. There are 29 genera, 261 species and 2 subspecies presently regarded as valid species in this family. The first genus to be described was Ergasilus von Nordmann, 1832, with two species, Ergasilus gibbus Nordmann, 1832, and Ergasilus sieboldi Nordmann, 1832. Ergasilus sieboldi attaches to the gill filaments using its second antennae and can cause tissue damage or secondary infections at the site of attachment. The nutrition of E. sieboldi was noted by Einszporn (1965a, b) , and it is known to cause severe fish losses in aquaculture (see Piasecki et al. 2004) . Over the years, several researchers mentioned different life stages of E. sieboldi, but there were many discrepancies between the different reports as they were often not complete studies on the life cycle. In 1991, Abdelhalim et al. (1991) were able to provide complete information on all of the different life stages for this species.",

However, it was only in 1932 when Wilson elevated both of these groups to family level, removing them from Ergasilidae.

Benz went on to publish numerous articles on these copepods, including the description of a new family, 5 new genera and 17 species. Benz was both a student and close colleague of Kabata, and it seems fitting that his final publication before he passed away in 2015 was a memorial tribute paying homage to his mentor and friend (Benz and Goater 2015) . Superclass Oligostraca Zrzav\u00fd, Hyp\u0161a & Vl\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1, 1998 Class Ichthyostraca Zrzav\u00fd, Hyp\u0161a & Vl\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1, 1998 Subclass Branchiura Thorell, 1864 These parasitic Crustacea, often referred to as \"fish lice\", are small flattened ectoparasites of fish. Occasionally these parasites can occur on other hosts such as alligators (Ringuelet 1943) , salamanders (Poly 2003) and tadpoles (Stuhlmann 1891; Wolfe et al. 2001) . They all belong to the order Arguloida and family Argulidae with four recognised genera, Argulus M\u00fcller, 1785; Chonopeltis Thiele, 1900; Dipteropeltis Calman, 1912;  and Dolops Audouin, 1837 (see Table 2 .1). Approximately 168 species are known worldwide (Ahyong et al. 2011) , and only Argulus occurs in marine environments, the other genera being exclusively freshwater parasites. William J. Poly summarised the global diversity of all branchiurans in freshwater and highlighted the current distribution of each of the different genera in the different biogeographic regions of the world (Poly 2008) . A year later, Ole Sten M\u00f8ller reviewed the history and taxonomy of this group, giving a chronological account of each group's history from previously inaccessible literature (M\u00f8ller 2009) . This publication provides valuable information on the Branchiura systematics and morphology and is a helpful aid for any researcher working on these parasites. Recently, Neethling and Avenant-Oldewage (2016) compiled an extensive review of the Branchiura. This compendium features a full overview of the four genera, stating the characteristics and taxonomic changes for each genus, as well as the geographical distributions and host records for each species, and is a comprehensive synopsis of literature on these parasites up to this point.",

            "text": "The phylogenetic position of the branchiurans has been complicated with many different theories and misinterpretations of certain characters that were used to define this unique group (especially with the second maxilla). These parasites were first termed Branchiura (or gill-tails) by Thorell (1864) , based on the importance of the \"tail\" morphology, but had been previously placed within the siphonostome Copepoda by Heller (1857) and Kr\u00f8yer (1863) . The idea that the Branchiura were more closely linked to the Branchiopoda (\"Phyllopoda\" in Thorell, 1864) was not widely accepted, and in 1875, Claus reaffirmed that the Branchiura were more closely related to the copepods. Claus (1875) suggested placing the group as a suborder within the Copepoda and Leydig (1889) concurred. In 1902, when Charles Branch Wilson (Fig. 2.7h ) revised the parasitic copepods of the family Argulidae, these branchiurans were still viewed as copepods. This extensive review covered 29 species of Argulus, 9 species of Dolops and 1 species of Chonopeltis (Wilson 1902) . Finally, Johannes Thiele ( Fig. 2.7i ) studied the cephalic appendages of the Branchiura and concluded these parasites were not in fact copepods as commonly thought (with no first maxilla in the mouth cone) and should rather be on a level equal to the copepods and phyllopods (Thiele 1904) . However, even after this breakthrough, the classification remained unchanged. Almost 30 years later, Martin (1932) completed an in-depth study on the mouth cone and once again suggested Branchiura as a subclass, but it took another 10 years before this new classification was eventually acknowledged in another publication (Ringuelet 1943) . Since then (with a few exceptions), the Branchiura and Copepoda have been considered separate groups.",

This discovery made him the authority of more than half of the Chonopeltis species known at the time (Fryer 1959 (Fryer , 1960a . Furthermore, Fryer completed noteworthy ecological studies on this genus, noting for the first time that the adults are sedentary (Fryer 1956) , and there is a lack of cephalic lobe rods in C. flaccifrons (see Fryer 1960a ). Fryer went on to describe several more species, produce a key for the genus and show the difference between Chonopeltis and the already known Argulus and Dolops larvae with the lack of metanauplius or juvenilelike morphology in the first descriptions of the Chonopeltis larval stages (Fryer 1964 (Fryer , 1974 (Fryer , 1977 .",

In 2017, Van As et al. revised the southern African species of Chonopeltis and found that contrary to earlier theories, each river system does not have its own species of Chonopeltis. After careful examination of all C. meridionalis Fryer, 1964; C. victori Avenant-Oldewage, 1991; and C. koki Van As, 1992, material, it was concluded that all are indeed the same species, C. meridionalis, and occur in multiple river systems but only on cyprinid hosts (Van As et al. 2017).

Dolops ranarum (Stuhlmann, 1891) and D. tasmanianus Fryer, 1969 are known from sub-Saharan Africa and Tasmania (Australia), respectively, making this genus widespread but confined to the southern hemisphere. The first Dolops was noticed by the French entomologist Jean Victoire Audouin (1837) who thought the specimens looked like Argulus but without the suction discs. The meaning of the generic name is uncertain but has a Greek mythology origin. Unaware of the naming of Dolops, Heller described Gyropeltis Heller, 1857, which was based on the South American species. Although it was described after Audouin, Heller's description contained detailed drawings and notes not seen in the publication by Audouin. Due to this, some authors used Gyropeltis rather than Dolops (see Kr\u00f8yer 1863; Thorell 1864). Only 33 years later (and 60 years after describing Dolops) did Bouvier (1897) use the correct genus name and explain how, even if it seems less informative, Dolops was sufficiently described by Audouin and is the accepted authority for the genus.",

The adult parasites have two pairs of retractile hooks on either side of the mouth, creating a grouping of five anterior appendages from which the group's name is derived (\"five mouths\", although only one is an actual mouth). They are often found in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of vertebrates (birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals and even humans) where they lay eggs (Par\u00e9 2008) . These eggs are excreted out via the digestive system of the definitive host and then ingested by an intermediate host (most often a fish or small herbivorous mammal).",

            "text": "The French veterinarian Philibert Chabert (1787) noticed the first tongue worm inside the nasal cavities of horses and dogs. However, the first species, Linguatula serrata Fr\u00f6lich, 1789, was only named 2 years later, from the lung of a hare. This species is one of the most synonymised pentastomes with 13 junior synonyms. The Swedish-born \"father of helminthology\", Karl Asmund Rudolphi (Fig. 2.8f) , recognised that these worms were different to others and placed them into a single group, the genus Pentastomum Rudolphi, 1812. However, he was still unable to place them (like many others after him), and they have been grouped with various taxa including annelids, mites, myriapods, onychophorans and tardigrades (see Abele et al. 1989) . Dujardin (1845) believed these parasites were different from all the other worms and most closely resembled arthropods based on their striated muscles. Using molecular techniques, Abele et al. (1989) concluded that pentastomids belong in the Crustacea as they are more closely related to fish lice (Argulus) rather than any of the other possible taxa mentioned above. Almeida and Christoffersen (1999) also used cladistics on the pentastomids and challenged some of the older ideas. With the recent discovery of fossil data, there is even more discussion on the phylogenetics and status of this group (see Castellani et al. 2011) .",

The body resembles a clam and is encased by two valves, which forms a carapace. Very little was known about these crustaceans eating preferences for many years. The first mention was by Baird (1850) where he stated that most are essentially carnivorous; nothing specific about their feeding mode was noted. Most ostracods these days are considered to be free-living, predators or scavengers, but there are a few instances of symbiotic (and possibly parasitic) relationships.",

Charles Branch Wilson (Fig. 2.7h ) was the first to categorically state that these Cypridina Milne-Edwards, 1840, ostracods were parasitic (upon the gills of several fish), that the occurrence was not accidental and that it was not temporary (formation of a pocket to keep the crustacean in place). However, it was debated that these crustaceans are not truly parasitic and only attach to injured or unhealthy fish that are trapped (Cohen 1983 ). According to Stepien and Brusca (1985) , adult fishes in large, nearshore cages were attacked at night by zooplankton swarms, primarily consisting of the luminescent ostracod, Vargula tsujii Kornicker & Baker, 1977, and the cirolanid isopod, Cirolana diminuta Menzies, 1962. Although the ostracods attached and fed on mucus and skin of the fish, they did not appear to inflict serious harm on the host. They were only found inside fish damaged by the cirolanid isopods and thus could not be considered parasites in this instance.",

The \"parasitic\" ostracod investigated, Sheina orri Harding, 1966 , was found in the gills of the epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum (Bonnaterre, 1788) in Australia. The authors noted that this crustacean used their mandibular and maxillular claws to attach to the gills, which caused damage to the gills. The claws seemed to be adapted for this purpose, and the damage to the gills suggested they had been attached for a considerable amount of time. Thus, it is a parasite for at least part of its life cycle. This study also found that Wilson's (1913) description of Photeros parasitica (Wilson, 1913) (originally as Cypridina parasitica) was so similar to Sheina orri that it is most likely parasitic too. More individual studies on the different symbiotic ostracods need to be completed in order to determine if true parasitism is found in other ostracod species.",

With time, these discoveries became more linked to the area where the respective taxonomist was based and what material they had at their disposal. This led to a biased account on species diversity, influenced by the researcher rather than the presence of the parasite. Furthermore, most of the early biologists were involved in many different fields and described new species from diverse taxa. Over the years, this pattern has altered, and there are now more taxa-specific parasitologists working on species from around the world. It is important to note that many of the currently known crustacean parasitologists are however near retirement; thus, young researchers need to be trained to continue their outstanding work. With a better understanding of what has been done, we can now focus on what needs to be done in order to gain further insight into this unique group of parasites and their niche in the aquatic environment.",
