Besides, increased D-dimer, high N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and increased serum amyloid A were also reported to be risk factors for disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19 [12] [13] [14] . As components of blood routine test available for almost all hospitalized patients, PBICs usually serve as practical markers in infectious disease. Indeed, leukocytosis, leukopenia, and lymphopenia have been reported to be commonly seen in COVID-19 patients [15] . However, the underlying changes of other peripheral blood inflammatory cells (PBICs) in COVID-19 patients are little known, especially eosinophil level and lymphocyte subsets. Additionally, the risk factors for the underlying changes of these PBICs as well as their roles in COVID-19 patients' outcomes are not well addressed yet.",

One study based on 249 cases of mild type showed that 45.5% of COVID-19 patients suffered from decreased CD4+T cells counts, and 92.8% of the patients had normal CD4+T/CD8+T ratio [25] . Meanwhile, this study also revealed that CD4+T cell count (per 100 cells/\u03bcl increase) was independently associated with ICU admission (OR=0.55,95%:0.33-0.92, P=0.02) according to multivariate logistic regression [25] . In another study based on 44 patients, lymphocyte subsets analyzed results showed that the total number of B cells, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in the whole group, and this decrease became more evident in the cases of severe type when compared with non-severe type (743.6/uL vs 1020.1/uL; P =0.032) [19] . In more detail, T cells along with NK cells were below normal levels, but B cells were within normal range, with the situation becoming more worse in patients of severe type [19] , which coincided with the results from the other study enrolling 37 COVID-19 cases according to blood sample before initial treatment [26] . Additionally, there was an increase of CD8+T cells and B cells in patients with clinical response, but there was no significant change of any lymphocyte subset detected in patients without clinical response [26] . These results are consistent with our results, regarding the total counts alteration of T cells, B cells, and NK cells in patients with different classifications. Differently, we retrospectively investigated the distribution of lymphocyte subsets (2 weeks after treatment rather than pretreatment) in patients with one-month outcome in COVID-19 patients and also analyzed its predicting role in one-month outcome (Recovery versus Un-discharged/died), which may useful in judging patients' prognosis.",

Additionally, some extra strengths were raised in our own study, when compared with previous results. First, we discovered that clinical classification-critically severe was the risk factor for eosinopenia, lymphopenia as well as one-month outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Second, we identified the alteration regularity of PBICs in COVID-19 patients during treatment, not only in recovery patients but also in aggravated patients. Third, severe COVID-19 patients suffered from weak cellular immunity, including reduced counts of T cells and NK cells. Importantly, it may be that the functional damage of CD4+T cells that makes COVID-19 patients susceptible to severe disease, and the excessive exhaustion of CD8+T cells that impairs cellular immune response to 2019-nCoV in severe patients according to the literature review [27] . Finally, we put forward that PBICs might serve as indicators of disease severity and signals of disease progression in COVID-19.",

The second issue is that the lymphocyte subsets was collected 2 weeks after treatment rather than the first day or within 7 days after admission. Third, the risk factors for neutropenia, neutrocytosis and monopenia were not thoroughly investigated in our study, since the neutrophils can be affected by too many other factors including other infection, and the lower limit for monocyte counts is zero according to normal range. Further more, the PBICs were not analyzed in the sputum of patients in our study, and the pathological findings of COVID-19 was based on only one case's autopsy. Moreover, the definations of acute phase, recovery phase and aggravated phase were raised by ourselves rather than explicit guideline. Finally, the alterations of PBICs except for leukocytes can also be caused by other confounding factors, such as severe infection, which were not described at length. Hence, clinical study with large scale and well-designed quality is still needed before using PBICs as diagnostics and prognostication in COVID-19 patients.",
