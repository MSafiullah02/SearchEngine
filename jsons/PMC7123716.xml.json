Microbiological control personnel need some primer on the complex subject of biologics which is not readily available from a single source. Biologics mode of action is based upon immune modulation and manufacturing has diverged from the more basic historical disciplines to become much more highly specialized. This forms somewhat of an inherent tension in that we need some immunological background to understand changing precepts affecting microbiological contamination control (MCC), yet as non-immunology-expert specialists we cannot expect to obtain an expert understanding of concepts that have exploded in complexity the last ten years.",

There are many significant differences between biologics and LVPs and SMDs. LVPs are among the oldest injection therapies containing only simple ingredients such as salts, sugars, electrolytes, etc. They generally have no active ingredient whereas, typically, a SMD contains a chemically synthesized active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Modern biologics are genetically-engineered (cloned from human genes or other natural sources) and produced as recombinant proteins, sugars, or nucleic acids (or complex combinations of these), but also may be whole cells, tissues, blood components, antibodies, etc. The differences that have accrued in terms of both the molecules and the means of production is overviewed here.",

Jenner\u2019s smallpox treatment was used as early as 1798 (and was likely used even earlier by the Chinese) but was not based upon the paradigm of a manufactured or \u201cmanufacturable\u201d product, but rather upon the observation that milk maids whom routinely caught cow pox did not seem to get small pox and thus the pus from such sores could be used as preventative inoculates. Pasteur began to understand, develop and apply the specific scientific principles of \u201cgerm theory\u201d. Prior to developing his widely-publicized vaccine for rabies, Pasteur had worked on vaccines for chicken cholera (1878) and anthrax (1881). The Pasteur story is particularly compelling as he saved a young French boy\u2019s life (Joseph Meister) upon the first use of the vaccine in humans.",

Some early efforts show that there were legitimate treatments developed to harness the power of the mammalian immune system via the use of animal serum, antitoxins, and vaccines at a level of sophistication that is surprising given the state of scientific knowledge at the time. While these kinds of early preparations are \u201cbiologics\u201d (as derived from living cells), they are not what we think of today by the term \u201cBiologics\u201d. Biologics in the modern sense are a class of therapeutics produced by recombinant DNA technology where a gene is inserted into a cell culture organism (typically mammalian or microbe) or other growth expression system (plant or transgenic animal).

The protein sequence has been tweaked to create fast acting, short acting, long acting, and intermediate acting regimens [10]. As a drug, as opposed to the natural, internal secretion and absorption that occurs constantly inside the healthy human body, insulin, has several challenges including the mode of administration, dosage and timing (relative to food intake and exercise, stress or illness), uptake variability from the blood stream, lack of excised C-peptide in dosed form, etc. Structural variants are called analogs and recombinant technology has allowed the production of several variant amino acid structures as detailed below in Fig. 8.3. Without biotechnology one simply could not gain the kind of control over nature\u2019s molecules that has been obtained today, even to the extent of man-made evolution in tailoring them to offset the effects of external drug delivery.

At present, this difference is not largely appreciated as a paradigm shift.

Biologic therapeutic action is often gained by the interaction of protein ligands and receptors as CSSMs. A lymphocyte has more than 300 CSSMs on its surface including TLRs and, all in all, based upon human genome project sequence annotation, \u201cmore than 4,000 molecules have been identified as potential CSSMs, based on similarities in their transmembrane protein structure, along with their signature intracellular and extracellular domains\u201d (Zhu, Yao, and Chen).

See Fig. 8.5. MAbs are large molecules that specifically target CSSMs to either prevent or promote (co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory) the fulfillment of functions important to specific cancers (in this instance). The mode of action of the biologics contrasts the small molecules that enter into cells and thus largely target fast growing tissues. Gemcitabine is a nucleotide analog that mimics cysteine (the C in DNA/ATGC) but curtails replication due to imperfect mimicking of nucleotide action and cisplatin has a different mode of action but similarly disrupts DNA replication. Since cancer cells are the fastest growing cells (and apparently for no better reason), then more cancer cells die than normal cells. Thus, the SMD cancer treatments are more invasive (entering not just cancer cells but also healthy cells), non-specific (no specific molecular target other than the DNA common to all cells), prone to generate resistance over time (limited window of positive effects), and generally bring more unpleasant side effects than the new biologic drugs. According to Barker and Andrews: [28]This results in side effects which have a significant impact on the patient, such as gut toxicity, immunosuppression and hair loss; these effects limit the doses of chemotherapeutic that can be given and the overall efficacy that can be achieved in many situations. Thus, whilst cytotoxic chemotherapy is useful in some types of tumours, the results for many of the common solid tumours are relatively disappointing and agents that are effective against these solid tumours and which are better tolerated would represent a major step forward in the fight against cancer.2",

            "text": "As an overview of various classes of biologics, seven major classes (with enzymes, hormones and peptide drugs combined into a single category) are described below and include an example drug and mechanism of action (MOA) description.Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)- mAbs consist of three major classes that include (a) immune stimulating (i.e. cancer treatments), (b) inflammation and autoimmune suppressing and (c) miscellaneous, a basket of molecules that includes several novel acting drugs for the treatment of asthma, anthrax, organ transplant and RSV infection (Baldo). Omalizumab is an asthma drug that acts by binding to IgE antibodies in the C\u03b53 paratope region that is important for IgE to bind mast cells. In this way, Omalizumab interferes (via steric hindrance) with mast cell activation which includes the reduction of adverse allergic type responses including anaphylaxis. The suppression of the immune system in some specific biologic treatments against autoimmune diseases has also lead to the very slightly increased occurrence of a rare brain cancer caused by a usually latent virus [32].Enzymes, hormones, glycoprotein hormones, and peptide drugs- human enzyme deficiencies include those from genetic disorders (inborn errors of metabolism) and those with levels (too much or too little) affected by other disorders. Certain genetically acquired disorders can be corrected by supplying enzymes that have (via recombinant production) corrected receptors (CSSMs), for example, as described below.The discoveries of specific recognition of phosphorylated mannose residues, mannose receptor-mediated uptake of lysosomal enzymes, and the presence of these receptors on macrophages, demonstrated that a lysosomal enzyme needs to be specifically recognized by its target cells. These insights led to the first successful enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for type I Gaucher disease that occurs with a frequency of 1 in 75,000 births worldwide, making it the most prevalent of the sphingolipid storage disorders. Gaucher disease is the result of an inborn error of metabolism due to a deficiency of the lysosomal acid \u03b2-glucosidase glycoprotein, \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase; \u03b2-glucosyl- N -acylsphingosine glucohydrolase) which cleaves \u03b2- D -glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside) into glucose and ceramide. The enzyme\u2019s substrate is a widely distributed cell membrane component and, in the absence of \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase, glucocerebroside, and other glycolipids accumulate by as much as 20\u2013100-fold in the lysosomes of cells, particularly macrophages and other cells of the reticuloendothelial system. With this background, glucocerebrosidase prepared from human placenta and marketed as Ceredase\u00ae was used to reverse the clinical manifestations of type I Gaucher disease by targeting the patients\u2019 macrophages after sequential deglycosylation to expose mannose residues. Imiglucerase, a recombinant, deglycosylated glucocerebrosidase prepared in Chinese hamster ovary cells by DNA technology, was soon introduced and because it proved at least as clinically effective as Ceredase\u00ae and could provide a pathogen-free preparation in almost unlimited amounts, it (as Cerezyme\u00ae) soon replaced its predecessor. (Baldo)This example, along with the switch from animal-derived insulin to recombinant human insulin, shows the vast utility of recombinant proteins (r-proteins) as compared to harvesting natural forms (n-proteins). Hormones and peptide drugs include insulin, glucagon, human growth hormone, vasopressin, and parathyroid hormone. Glycoprotein hormones include follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone. As an aside, the use of r-proteins such as human insulin brings a greater exactness and specificity to treatments whereas reliance upon animal extracted proteins was time consuming, laborious and made for less desirable drugs (especially from a microbiological and adventitious contaminant control vantage).Vaccines are harmless biological preparations made from infectious agents intended to stimulate the immune system to produce a long-lasting immune protection. Some important diseases remain that cannot be protected against via vaccination including AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and prion disease. Cancer vaccines are also being developed. MAbs are being developed as an immune treatment (as an alternative to long-acting vaccination) for some infections (as in RSV).4 Subunit vaccines are viewed as safer in that a protein gene cloned and expressed for use as a specific antigen cannot revert to a disease-causing state as can an attenuated organism. An example of this is the hepatitis B vaccine that uses a surface protein to aid in the prevention of hepatitis associated liver cancer. DNA vaccines have also been developed to encode a specific antigen protein after injection. Interestingly, for DNA vaccines, CpG bacterial sequences are included as the adjuvant type. This speaks to the modern use of TLR activators (PAMPs) as adjuvants and parallels the inclusion concerns of impuirity/contaminants as adjuvants.Beyond doubt, the advent of sequencing, rendering microbial genomes readily accessible, has been of utmost importance for vaccinology and has allowed for highly rational identification of vaccine antigens. Many novel vaccines currently in development are thus based on proteins or peptides predicted by computer databases or by screening antigen libraries [33, 34]. Although these advances in the post-genomic era have enabled the design of highly pure, safe and simple vaccines, other challenges have emerged in parallel, including the inherent lack of immunostimulatory properties of proteins and peptides. Vaccine adjuvants are therefore considered key components in modern vaccinology since they provide the necessary help of enhancing the immune responses [35]Here one may have picked up on an inherent contradiction. That is, that foreign proteins from microbes and virions produced recombinantly and purified are often not immunogenic and thus adjuvants (that are in essence contaminants) must be added whereas purified human recombinant proteins (such as based on IgG scaffold) manufactured as recombinant proteins often come with immunologic side effects.Early vaccines had no need for adjuvants, as they contained everything but the kitchen sink, microbiologically speaking. As vaccines have become more purified, they have become less immunogenic. Unwanted side effects may come from using killed whole microorganisms or from adding too ambiguous an immune irritant. Therefore, today the choice of an adjuvant is a sophisticated effort. Contained in that effort is also the attempt to stimulate the appropriate immune response pathway to match the specific immune mechanism of action of the disease which is being vaccinated against (see Fig. 8.7).Very few antigens are inherently immunogenic and virtually all vaccines require adjuvants in some form, endogenous or exogenous. Without a component that engages either innate immune cells or additional receptors on lymphocytes such as complement receptors [36], most non-adjuvanted, highly-purified antigens induce tolerance rather than immunity [37]. Very few antigens, such as certain toxins, are capable of inducing antibody responses when administered without adjuvants. Because of their immunogenicity, non-toxic derivatives of some toxins are being developed as adjuvants themselves, such as cholera toxin (CT) or E. coli enterotoxin (LT) (reviewed in [38]). The first scientific reports of exogenous adjuvants deliberately added to vaccines are less than a century old and come from Gaston Ramon in the 1920s [39]. The substances he added to vaccines to \u201cenhance immune responses\u201d were complex and poorly defined and included tapioca starch and agarose. These early adjuvants, however, did trigger inflammation, which subsequently enhanced vaccine-specific lymphocyte responses. Adjuvanticity in this scenario is through a bystander effect with a significant amount of \u201cwasted inflammation\u201d (Quote from N.M. Valiante (Novartis Vaccines)), defined as excessive innate immune responses, which result in reactogenicity but only partially contribute to the adaptive immune response [40].Coagulation factors \u2013 mammalian blood coagulation is a complex process with the interaction of many factors (and contrasts the greatly simplified Limulus coagulation process). Queen Victoria (born in 1819) had hemophilia and thus the disease had been known long before the blood system factors were characterized. There are two types -hemophilia A, which occurs due to the lack of clotting factor VIII, and hemophilia B, which occurs due to the lack of clotting factor IX. Both afflictions are typically inherited from one\u2019s parents through the X chromosome with a nonfunctional gene and thus disproportionately affect males. There are more than a dozen blood clotting factors produced recombinantly including Factor VIIa, VIII, IX, IX FC (fusion protein), XIII. In addition to recombinant forms there are also many forms purified from pooled human plasma. Some of both the recombinant and natural forms may include severe hypersensitivity and fever responses. The mechanism of supplying a specific enzyme for a clotting pathway is merely to supply the missing link (functional enzyme) that breaks the chain of events (i.e. protease cascade) necessary to properly coagulate the blood.Cytokines- are produced by cells of the immune system and are generally thought of as signals act that locally upon CSSMs versus hormones which act over greater distance in the body, however, systemic effects also result from additive local effects from cytokines (including sepsis). This category includes both drugs used as cytokines and as cytokine receptor antagonists to modulate the immune response, including chemokines, interferons, interleukins, lymphokines, and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) but not hormones or growth factors (which are another class of biologic therapy). As of June of 2016, there were 23 approved cytokines (and antagonists) as biologics therapeutic drugs, including interferons, interleukins, erythropoietin, bone morphogenic proteins, receptor antagonists for IL, INF and TNF. Anakinra, for example, binds to the IL-1RI receptor thus blocking IL-1\u03b1 and \u03b2. The IL-1RI /IL1-\u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor system is important in governing the activities of cartilage degradation and bone resorption.An overview of the actions of various cytokines is given by Tisoncik et al. [42]Interferons-regulation of innate immunity, activation of antiviral properties, anti-proliferative effectsInterleukins-growth and differentiation of leukocyte recruitment; many are proinflammatoryChemokines-control of chemotaxis, leukocyte recruitment; many are proinflammatoryColony-stimulating factors-stimulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiationTumor necrosis factor-proinflammatory, activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes.Fusion or chimeric proteins- two different proteins, each with a unique function, can be fused to form a single therapeutic protein. Etanercept is a fusion protein that uses the Fc portion of IgG antibody linked to the ligand-binding portion of a TNF receptor. The binding of the fusion molecule to the TNF receptor prevents the interaction of the receptor with the TNF cytokine thus reducing the associated inflammatory responses in rheumatoid arthritis and other auto-immune diseases. TNF receptor binding is shown below in Fig. 8.8.Cell therapy- the use of IgG fragments as well as whole immune cells (i.e. T cells) that have been genetically modified consists of those taken from an individual and returned to the same individual (autologous) and those that have been taken from one but returned to many (allogenic). The earliest cell types to be taken and returned were for bone marrow stem cell transplantation. Some promising new cancer treatments are based upon the modification of T cell receptors/ T cells such that they are sensitized to neoplasms. An interesting differentiation between cells grown for administration and those grown to produce a recombinant drug is that the cells for r-production are grown and discarded and are often known to accrue genetic aberrations over time (CHO) as this is not their natural mode of growth (cell culture). However, the introduction of whole cells must contain only cells that maintain the proper genetic structure (\u201cphenotype, genotype and even karyotype\u201d) and must not contain cell culture media [44].A rapidly emerging immunotherapy approach is called adoptive cell transfer (ACT): collecting and using patients\u2019 own immune cells to treat their cancer. There are several types of ACT (see \u201cACT: TILs, TCRs, and CARs\u201d), but, thus far, the one that has advanced the furthest in clinical development is called CAR T-cell therapy.In 2017, two CAR T-cell therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), one for the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the other for adults with advanced lymphomas. Nevertheless, researchers caution that, in many respects, it\u2019s still early days for CAR T cells and other forms of ACT, including questions about whether they will ever be effective against solid tumors like breast and colorectal cancer [45].",

As these cells grow and produce therapeutic proteins, they also produce other substances (simply by being alive, reproducing, etc.) that may include those excreted (exotoxins) as well as those intrinsic to their makeup (DNA, RNA, porins, flagellin, endotoxin, etc.). These residues must be removed via various chromatography steps and may include endotoxin in very large amounts if E. coli if used as an expression system. The importance of HCPs to impurity control is given by Wang et al. [48].HCPs constitute a major group of process-related impurities in a drug product. The risks associated with HCPs are primarily immunogenicity. HCPs are complex mixtures with diverse physiochemical and immunological properties [49]. Almost all HCPs carry clinical safety risks as foreign proteins due to the potential to elicit immune response in humans. In addition, some HCPs can also act as adjuvants to enhance immune response to a drug product [50, 51]. Certain HCPs with proteolytic activity can also affect drug product stability and efficacy if not adequately removed or inactivated [52]. HCPs have the potential to affect both the safety and efficacy aspects of a given drug product.How are all these non-product proteins detected and, thus, how can it be determined if they have been removed? Typically, polyclonal antibodies are raised against the product and expression system that is manufactured minus the drug protein and subsequently, in batch to batch runs, the determined set or library of polyclonal antibodies can be used to determine the level and extent of removal success via ELISA testing. The identification of specific protein markers known or suspected to be immunogenic has also accrued.",

[53] biologics production has some unique aspects of concern in the removal of nucleic acids, particularly residual DNA:Residual DNA (rDNA) is comprised of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments and longer length molecules originating from the host organism that may be present in samples from recombinant biological processes. Although similar in basic structural base pair units, rDNA may exist in different sizes and physical forms. Interest in measuring rDNA in recombinant products is based primarily on demonstration of effective purification during manufacturing, but also on some hypothetical concerns that, in rare cases, depending on the host expression system, some DNA sequences may be potentially infectious or oncogenic (e.g., HIV virus and the Ras oncogene, respectively) \u2026.Genomic DNA from microbial sources, on the other hand, could add to risk of immunogenicity to the target recombinant protein being expressed, due to the high CpG content and unmethylated DNA sequence. For these and other reasons, it is necessary for manufacturers to show clearance of DNA throughout production processes and to confirm low levels in the final drug substance using an appropriately specific and quantitative analytical method.The most common methodology for rDNA quantitation used currently is real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a robust and proven technology. Like most rDNA quantitation methods, the specificity of RT-PCR is limited by the sequences to which the primers are directed.",

Additionally, there is much that is new in terms of microbiological control strategy. In Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-17148-3_9 Shen describes methods used to remove endotoxin impurities or contaminants. It is good to make the distinction between impurities which are potential residual components of the upstream product expression system (CHO cell, E. coli, yeast, plants, etc.) and potential contaminants which arise from downstream non-sterile process ingress (i.e. from bioburden). Both routes can include endotoxin: upstream if the expression system is a Gram-negative organism such as E. coli or downstream via water-based/buffer downstream processes as Gram-negatives are the likely forms to grow in non-sterile and pH neutral aqueous solutions.",

Recommended sampling points include (paraphrased for brevity) the following:Media preparation - on an appropriate number of batches at scale, based on statistical analysis and/or risk assessment, test for bioburden/endotoxin just prior to filtration or sterilization of the mediaFor filtered buffers, perform bioburden/endotoxin on appropriate number of batches at scaleFor final diafiltration / formulation buffers, endotoxin testing is recommended prior to use...Non-filterable buffers should be freshly prepared and used as soon as possible. Bioburden and endotoxin sampling/testing for non-filtered buffers is recommended.Prior to transfer to the next bioreactor, a bioburden sample may be tested or kept as a back-up sample\u2026Clarified harvest pool (filtered or unfiltered) should be tested for bioburden/endotoxin for all batches just prior to the start of the following process step.To evaluate column and UF/DF performance perform bioburden/endotoxin testing on an appropriate number of batches at scale.Endotoxin/bioburden test protein pool (filtered or unfiltered) at the end of chromatography and UF/DF operationsResin storage conditions should be tested for bioburden.Take bioburden and endotoxin samples from the final bulk drug substance (post filtration).Plate count recoveries >250 CFU on the most dilute sample are reported as TNTC which for any in-process bioburden sample should result in an Action Level / OOS, which requires an investigation.Unlike non-sterile drug manufacturing where the processing environments are often hostile to microbial growth or include the addition of preservatives, manufacturing of biologics require growth mediums (upstream) that enhance bacterial growth or process buffers (downstream).",

This makes Limulus-based testing critical to perform in support of the bioburden results which, may, step to step, begin again from zero in a serial fashion. In this way, Limulus-based testing is necessary to perform in conjunction with bioburden testing. This is depicted in Fig. 8.10.",

The risk assessments require review of the microbial quality of direct materials, utilities (WFI, process gases, etc.), and individual steps within the series of unit operations that constitute the DS and DP manufacturing process. For each step, the assessment should evaluate process/operational conditions and existing controls regarding the equipment, the manufacturing environment, and personnel preventive controls for their effectiveness at controlling and minimizing microbial contamination, with a goal of prevention of ingress, and proliferation in the process, equipment, and product. In addition, the existing microbial detection controls should be assessed to ensure they provide continued verification that the microbial prevention controls are working as intended. Detection controls consist of bioburden and endotoxin testing against established limits on samples obtained from defined process steps.

They showed a large amount of endotoxin-protein binding at 1 mg/mL and pH = 7, conditions that may be considered much less concentrated and thus less strenuous than many current drug manufacturing processes [98]. Indeed, many biologic drug product concentrations are greater than 1 mg/mL, as 40\u2013100 mg/mL are common [99]. With greater protein concentration comes greater potential endotoxin binding capacity. The pH is important because it determines the protein\u2019s charge and related activity relative to its isoelectric point (pI). The pI is the pH at which the charge of the protein is neutral (non-binding in solution). Petsch et al. study findings are summarized below in Table 8.3.",

The blood stream is full of various proteases with a range of specificities [100].

Several consequences derive from these circumstances. The so-called negative chromatographic mode is preferred, which allows binding of a byproduct or pollutant\u2014here endotoxins\u2014whereas the product passes the adsorber without considerable retention. Elution of endotoxin is not the object, and therefore irreversible adsorption is an option; it may often be welcome. This is deduced from the fact that adsorption is an equilibrium process that, due the low endotoxin threshold levels expected, requires a very low apparent dissociation constant, Kd, of endotoxin and sorbent. This condition also follows, owing to unavoidable interactions with substances proteins of much higher concentration, leading to competition for endotoxin. The latter leads to the unfortunate situation of the endotoxin often being carried piggyback through an adsorber, the extent being dependent on the different strengths of interactions of the many components involved [101].",

Aluminum salts (alum), squalene, surfactants, and oil in water are still used in various combinations to provoke immune responses for various proteins [103].

Even though vaccination against tetanus has existed for decades, in 2013 it still killed 58,000 people worldwide [107].

[110] (2007) disputed the idea of a \u201cuniversal epitope\u201d due to the presence of so many different MHC alleles in the human genome (7000 according to Sewell) [111]. This huge diversity is thought to be important to ensure survivors after emerging infectious epidemics. By making clones of the various peptide producing tetanus toxoid sequences they found the following matches (TT to MHC):...most of the TT-derived antigenic peptides were presented by 1 or 2 of the 10 alleles studied. However, there were some exceptions. For example, TT506\u2013525, TT826\u2013845 (bold added) and TT1226\u20131245 were presented by three alleles; TT586\u2013605, TT666\u2013685 and TT1234\u20131253 by four alleles and TT674\u2013693 by six alleles. Because each of these peptides is 20 residues in length, it is possible that some may contain multiple epitopes while others contain a single epitope that is truly promiscuous.These results contrast with the perceived notion that tetanus toxoid responses are dominated by universal CD4+ T-cell epitopes. Rather these results illustrate heterogeneous T-cell responses for different class II alleles and individual-specific variation of the T-cell repertoire. (James et al.)",

For example, cells that are specific for the immunodominant GILGFVFTL peptide from influenza virus can often recognize the Epstein\u2013Barr virus epitope GLCTLVAML [144] or the immunodominant HIV-derived SLYNTVATL antigen [145] (all of which are HLA-A2 restricted).

However, it is interesting to view the pI\u2019s of various underlying vaccine proteins as produced without adjuvant, as microbial or viral proteins, to see, out of curiosity, where they fall as compared to human proteins. Some notes relevant to the pI of microbial and viral proteins versus eukaryotic proteins as purified constituents of vaccines are given below:Michen and Graule [149] determined the pI of 100 animal viruses to be within the range of 2.6\u20137.4 (excluding Encephalomyocarditis which was between 8 and 9).The polio virus as vaccine precursor described by Thomassen et al. [150] made from \u201ccomplete intact polioviruses\u201d has a pI of 6.2\u20137.4. Though the polio vaccine is not a subunit vaccine (it is inactivated as per Baldo), it shares a similar pI range as described above.Mehlin et al. [151] expressed 1,000 proteins from Plasmodium falciparum (the malaria parasite is a eukaryotic protist) in an E. coli expression system and the mean pI was 8.2. \u201cThe trend towards insolubility with increasing pI was striking: of the 288 targets with a pI above 10 only one was soluble. At very low pI values, there appeared to be a tendency towards a lack of expression which was compensated for by greater level of solubility among those which did express. The mean pI of these targets, including the tags, was 8.2.\u201dKiraga et al. [152] state that: \u201cSchwartz et al. [153] and Knight et al. [154] found that membrane proteins are larger and more basic than non-membrane ones.\u201d Since most modern human therapeutic cell-surface-signaling proteins are membrane proteins, then these can be expected to have a higher pI as shown in a derivation of the Schwartz et al. figure above (Fig. 8.28).",

            "text": "Does Fig. 8.28 speak to the low immunogenic characteristics of many (subunit/recombinant) vaccine proteins as based on manufacturing considerations rather than epitope sequences? Most therapeutic human (non-vaccine) proteins being developed are CSSM\u2019s which are therefore membrane proteins (shown above as red, pI 8\u201310). The pI of most viral and many microbial proteins (purple and blue) have lower pI\u2019s and thus contrast many human proteins that are both larger (MW) and more basic (pI >8). The purified and expressed recombinant subunit vaccine proteins stand in stark contrast to historical highly immunogenic vaccines made of whole killed or attenuated (i.e. formaldehyde, see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-17148-3_2) organisms. This is clarified by Christensen:Historically, vaccines have been based on live attenuated or killed bacteria and viruses i.e., smallpox, measles, polio and tuberculosis. These vaccines have in most cases proven very effective, as recognized by the eradication of smallpox and reduction in polio cases to below 100 cases of wild polio virus globally in 2015([155]). Although very effective, these vaccines often come with risks of side effects; such as fever, rashes, swelling and in some cases even vaccine derived infections, the latter being the case for one-third of all polio cases worldwide in 2015. Furthermore, large-scale production and ensuring consistency of the vaccine is very challenging, as demonstrated in a number of cases of global shortage of vaccines. One example is the decline in global availability of BCG vaccine against tuberculosis, where 180 million doses were required in 2015 to meet global demands, and only 107 million doses were made available from manufacturers ([156]).To evade these issues, novel vaccine strategies have evolved where only the protective parts of the microbe are included, i.e. the so-called subunit vaccines. These can be produced in recombinant forms in yeast or bacteria yielding a product of high quantity, to be collected and purified. The currently registered hepatitis B vaccine is based on the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) produced in yeast cells. The high purity makes vaccine-induced adverse events less likely, but it has also caused the vaccines to become much less immunogenic and thus less effective. There has therefore been a growing need for adding immune-potentiators, also known as vaccine adjuvants, to the vaccines to increase the immunogenicity. (Christensen)",

            "text": "The isoelectric point of mAbs can differ substantially (~6 to ~9.5) despite the common IgG molecular scaffold. Figure 8.29 below from Goyon et al. demonstrates a range of isoelectric (pI) values [159]. However, it should be added that removal of endotoxin often employs Protein A as a first step and as such is not dependent upon the pI. The affinity of Protein A to mAbs occurs via attachment to the Ig Fc domain [160]. Goyon et al. discuss the method they used to determine pI and the importance of the pI value in monoclonal antibody purification.cIEF9 is a high resolution technique that separates species based on their pI or net charge, and takes into account solvent-exposed residues and internal amino acids. It has become the analytical platform of choice to characterize protein charge heterogeneity and determine experimental pIs. This part aimed at evaluating the pIs of 23 FDA and EMA approved mAbs as well as dalotuzumab and NIST mAb by comparing experimental results and theoretical calculations. As shown in Fig. 1 (here Fig. 8.29), pIs measured by icIEF were comprised between 6.1 and 9.4. The coefficient of variations (CVs) for three replicates were lower than 0.1% for all mAbs, confirming the robustness of icIEF, as already demonstrated by an inter-laboratory study [161]. Typical pI values, comprised between 8.0 and 9.0, were obtained for 13 mAbs [162]. Except infliximab and elotuzumab, 15 IgG1 have a pI higher than 8.0, while most of the IgG4 mAbs have pIs lower than 8.0 (this feature was related to the higher amount of acidic amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid in the primary sequence of IgG4). Therefore, our findings confirm that most IgG4 mAbs are less basic than IgG1 mAbs, in agreement with the literature. The ionic properties of the mAbs are a crucial parameter for their purification, as most processes include at least one ion exchange step [163]. For antibodies with a pI < 7.5, anion exchange chromatography (AEX) can be used in flow-through mode to remove process-related impurities. CEX is subsequently used to remove charged process-related impurities for mAbs with a pI > 7.0. In this context, cationic mAbs (pI > 7.0) [164] and especially those with a pI > 7.5 may be selected during developability studies, to avoid specific purification processes (e.g. host cell proteins removal and viral inactivation steps [165]), therefore two pI thresholds limits were set at 7.0 and 8.5 in Fig. 1. Except reslizumab (pI = 7.1), panitumumab(pI = 6.8) and eculizumab (pI = 6.1), 22 mAbs had pIs higher than 7.5.",

Sodium hydroxide solutions can efficiently remove precipitated proteins, lipids and nucleic acids while inactivating bacteria, viruses, yeast and endotoxins [173, 174]. High pH conditions during CIP also inactivate microbes while removing contaminants that could carry over into subsequent purification cycles [175]. However, even with CIP, the mAb binding capacity of the Protein A resin binding capacity decays over purification runs, typically requiring replacement after 50 to 300 cycles [170, 176]. Replacing a single industrial scale 1500-L protein A column can cost up to $12 M, not including the incurred production interruptions [177].

Since the regeneration condition is predominantly responsible for the decline in capacity, efforts are made to screen and identify additives to the solution that would protect the ligand while still allowing for effective resin cleaning and sanitization.Large amounts of microorganisms such as yeast and bacteria can destroy the function of chromatography columns and media. These organisms can also have indirect effects, such as clogging of filters and other system components as well as produce harmful substances such as endotoxins, enterotoxins, and proteases.

Some have differed philosophically with FDA whom has sought to address the lack of ability to recover spiked endotoxin from undiluted drug product that has served to dissociate (chelator) and mask endotoxin by abundant polysorbate molecules in specific formulation types (polysorbate with chelator). Thus endotoxin cannot be detected in such a state and if such a state exists in downstream unit processes, then it could pose a potential risk of missing the detection of endotoxin. As discussed above the protein binding phenomenon (Petsch et al.) has existed for decades with little recognition that the phenomenon may affect specific drug testing, likely because it made little difference to LVP or SMDs (that typically do not modulate immune reactions).",

[184] presented evidence that Limulus-based masking of formulated protein solutions via the LER phenomenon, though preventing the detection of endotoxin, nevertheless supports the expression of key cytokines when masked endotoxin is present including IL-6, IL-12, CXCL8 (chemokine interleukin 8) and TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, LPS masking does not prevent the activation of immune cell surface molecules from such solutions. As we saw in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-17148-3_7, the activation of cell surface molecules is the means by which therapeutic molecules target and modulate disease processes.Upon stimulation with LPS, monocytes up-regulate the activation markers and co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD83, whereas CD86 expression is down-regulated [185, 186]. These co-stimulatory molecules are especially important during the activation of T cells [187]. To investigate whether stimulation with masked LPS could also produce an increase in surface activation markers on monocytes, we analysed the surface expression of CD40, CD80, CD83 and CD86 by flow cytometry\u2026 Overall, our data show that masked LPS is a potent inducer of immune responses in primary human monocytes.

If two consecutive time points are <50%, then, by definition, LER has occurred.FDA has stated that if LER cannot be overcome, then a company must release-test individual lots of biologic using the rabbit pyrogen test (RPT) on an interim basis until an in vitro de-masking test can be developedA BLA post-approval commitment will be required to be developed as an (non-rabbit) in vitro test to overcome LER for the specific product",
