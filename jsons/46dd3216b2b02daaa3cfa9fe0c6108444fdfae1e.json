            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are associated with significant morbidity worldwide; viruses are by far the most common causes of ARTIs, especially among young children. 1 In particular, seasonal influenza viruses (type A and B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the main etiological agents during the epidemic period (between October and April in the northern hemisphere). 2,3 RSV infection is usually much more frequently identified than influenza in children; indeed, about 77% of infants have had an RSV infection before 5 years of age. This virus is the main cause of bronchiolitis, which is one of the major reasons of hospitalization in children under 2 years of age. 4 However, recent data show the important clinical role of seasonal influenza in children. In fact, the rate of hospitalization for seasonal influenza is not <3AE6 per 10 000 child \u2044 year, and hospitalization can also regard previously healthy children and children older than 2 years. 4, 5 The recent epidemiological scenario has been enlivened by the identification and emergence of several pathogens with an airborne transmission pathway such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), first isolated in 2001, 6 human bocavirus (hBoV), discovered in 2005, 7 and influenza virus 2009 A(H1N1), identified in 2009, and responsible for the first pandemic of the new millennium. 8 HMPV and hBoV are isolated in 3AE9-16% of children hospitalized for ARTIs. The first is associated with a large spectrum of clinical manifestations that range from mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia, 9, 10 and thus, it is considered to be one of the most important respiratory emerging viruses, while the second seems to have a marginal role as it causes mainly upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), when detected alone. 11 The 2009 pandemic influenza affected the pediatric population in 60% of cases 8 causing a significant number of recovery also in children aged over 5 years. It seems to cause generally mild disease, similar to those of seasonal influenza 12 , while severe manifestations seem concentrated in patients with risk factors.",

For RNA virus detection, cDNA was synthesized with pd(N)6 random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) using an MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Tech-Line, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Viral detection was performed by PCR assays. To simultaneously detect and type seasonal A and B influenza viruses, a one-step real-time RT-multiplex-PCR assay was performed using primer \u2044 probe sets for two different genome regions: the matrix region of influenza type A virus and the nucleoprotein region of influenza type B virus. 14 Influenza A-positive samples were subtyped using an RT-multiplex-PCR assay with specific primers for the hemagglutinin gene of influenza A \u2044 H1 and A \u2044 H3 viruses. 15 Pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus was detected using a onestep real-time RT-PCR, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. 16 RSV A and RSV B were identified by multiplex nested PCR (fusion gene, 336 and 582 bp, respectively) using specific primer sets. 17 Two nested PCR assays were performed to detect a 151-bp (nt. 44-195) fragment of the matrix gene of hMPV and a 354-bp (nt. 2351-2704) fragment of the nucleoprotein gene of hBoV, 18 respectively. Appropriate positive and negative controls were included in any PCR assay.",

The primary clinical relevance of RSV in children is well characterized. Serologic evidence indicates that nearly all children have been infected by RSV within the first 2 years of life. 22 Hospitalization is required in approximately 0AE5-2% of cases and 80% of these occur in the first year of life. 23 In Europe, RSV accounts for 42-45% of hospital admission for LRTIs in children younger than 2 years; in particular, in studies on hospitalized children, RSV is associated with bronchiolitis in 60-90% of cases and with pneumonia in 25-50% of cases. 24 No vaccines against this virus are available so far, but prophylaxis with palivizumab (a human, 25 The two most important studies on RSV epidemiology in Italy have shown that the epidemic starts in October-November and ends in April-May, with peak incidence in February. 3, [26] [27] [28] [29] In this study, RSV activity peaked in January; however, in contrast with previous studies, it rose gradually from October 2009.

These data are in agreement with published literature, in which frequencies of hMPV infections ranged from 3AE9% to 16%.

            "text": "HBoV infection was involved in 6% of ARTIs and in 41% of all co-infections identified. These data are in agreement with studies investigating hBoV infection in ARTIs, which have found a prevalence of 1AE5-18AE3%, 11,34 with a 42AE5% mean percentage of co-infections with other viral pathogens. 34 In most cases, hBoV had a marginal clinical importance when identified alone, causing an URTI in 43AE5% and requiring oxygen in 8AE7% of cases. However, according to other studies, this study raises the possibility that hBoV is also associated with severe ARTIs such as bronchiolitis, 35, 36 asthma exacerbations, 37,38 and pneumonia. 39 The seasonal peak of hBoV varies among studies, but is usually described in the early winter. 34 In this study, hBoV peak was observed in February, and its circulation was low at the end of 2009. In agreement with data registered in European countries, 30, 31, 40 the present study demonstrates that the 2009 pandemic influenza virus peaked in November 2009; In agreement with published literature, 41, 42 our data indicate that children with high hospitalization risk for pandemic influenza were not only those younger than 2 years of age or with chronic disease (as usually observed for seasonal influenza), but also children older than 5 years of age, accounting for more of 25% of recovery from 2009 pandemic influenza. Finally, 2009 pandemic influenza caused a clinical manifestation similar to seasonal influenza with mild severity, although these children had bad general conditions because of fever.",

A sharp rise in viral identification was observed between October and November (20 \u2044 92), when influenza 2009 A(H1N1) peaked in Italy. The frequency of viral infection was higher in December 2008 than in December 2009 (81 \u2044 99 versus 22 \u2044 40; P < 0AE05). The epidemic peaks of RSV (type A and B), hBoV, and hMPV were observed in January, February, and April, respectively. Seasonal influenza A \u2044 H1N1 and influenza A \u2044 H3N2 were detected only between December 2008 and April 2009, while their circulation was not registered in autumn or winter 2009. Influenza 2009 A(H1N1) was first detected in September and then peaked in November 2009 (Figure 1).",
