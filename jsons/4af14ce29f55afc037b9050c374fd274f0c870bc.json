Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socio-economic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing among the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app take-up, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. : medRxiv preprint",

In the absence of effective treatment or vaccination (as of April 2020), the public health response has so far relied on non-pharmaceutical measures to limit the spread of the epidemic, such as physical distancing, case isolation, and manual contact tracing [1] . These measures have not been sufficient to stop the epidemic. Many countries have therefore resorted to partial or full \"lockdown\" measures to control the epidemic, severely limiting social and economic interactions among their citizens. Although lockdowns may help countries to keep the number of infections under control [2] , they come at a great social and economic cost [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

            "text": "COVID-19 is difficult to trace by traditional methods as COVID-19 cases are infectious 1-2 days before experiencing symptoms and contacts on average become infectious 3-4 days after exposure. The window to achieve containment by manual contact tracing is thus extremely short. Ferretti, Wymant and colleagues [7] have proposed digital (app-based) contact tracing as an alternative measure to contain the epidemic without the large economic costs of lockdowns. The idea is to use low-energy Bluetooth connections between phones to record the interactions users have with others, particularly those interactions that may pose a higher risk of infection (e.g., spending more than 15 minutes within two metres of another person). If a user is diagnosed with COVID-19, they can use the app to declare the diagnosis, which leads to a notification of all other users who have come in close contact with the infected person, asking them to isolate at home for 14 days or until they have been tested by the public health authority. The main advantage over traditional (manual) forms of contact tracing is that the app allows instantaneous notification of contacts, which is a key determinant of the effectiveness of case isolation and contact tracing strategies for COVID-19 [7] . Other advantages are that the automatic recording of contacts scales up easily, and avoids the loss of information due to patients' recall bias and/or imperfect knowledge of the people they have been in contact with.",

The success of appbased contact tracing, however, critically depends on people's willingness to use the app. Hinch and colleagues [11] simulate the epidemic in the UK and show that the app reduces infections at all levels of take-up but that it is only sufficient to stop the epidemic if approximately 60% of the population use it. It is therefore important to gauge the strength of public support for this approach and to understand the factors that may hinder or facilitate take-up. For instance, since the app would need to trace individuals' interactions with others, privacy concerns may undermine support and adoption. [12] It is also possible that such a technological solution may not work as well for the less digitally literate share of the population, further increasing the unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic within and across countries [13] . In this sense, an \"opt-out\" installation policy, where mobile phone providers or Apple and Google [14] would automatically install the app on phones, could maximize take-up. It is unclear, however, whether the public would be willing to support this more intrusive solution.",

A complete description of the survey can be found in the Multimedia Appendix; here we provide an overview. At the beginning, after collecting respondents' informed consent, we described the app, explaining how it would function as well as its purpose. Respondents had to pass a comprehension check to proceed further. We then asked respondents how likely they would be to install the app on their phone, if it became available to download voluntarily (\"opt-in\" installation policy). Respondents were then asked about their main reasons for and against installing the app as well as their compliance with self-isolation requests. Next, we assessed to what degree respondents would be open to an \"opt-out\" policy, where mobile phone providers would automatically install the app on all phones, but users would be able to uninstall the app at any time. We then collected demographic information and concluded the survey with questions about respondents' attitudes towards the government under different installation regimes.",

An opt-out regime is likely to translate into higher effective installation rates, for instance by reducing the negative effects of procrastination or inattention [15] . However, our data suggests that only governments that enjoy a relatively high level of trust from their citizens may be able to resort to more paternalistic approaches.

However, we find that the details we gave about implementation (e.g., whether the app uses Bluetooth or GPS) seem to have very little impact on support.

In the following, we describe the various parts in more details. After expressing their informed consent to take part in the study, respondents were given a description of the contact tracing app. We explained that the app would be developed by a national health organization and that, once installed, it would register other users in close proximity via Bluetooth (and, in the case of the US and the UK, potentially location data). Users who were found to have been in close proximity to a confirmed case of COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes would be alerted by the app and asked to quarantine at home for 14 days or until they could be tested for the virus. All other users would see an \"all clear\" message. We further explained that an early quarantine would prevent individual users from passing on the virus to their loved ones in the early (presymptomatic) stages of their potential infection, and might slow down or even stop the epidemic. We also stressed that the identity of all users would be private throughout the entire process. In order to progress to the main part of the survey, respondents had to correctly answer three comprehension questions about the functioning of the app. CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

In the US, most states were under a \"stay at home\" order by the time of the survey, but not all of them. To reflect this difference in the environment respondents faced, we slightly adjusted the phrasing of some of our questions between areas in lockdown and those that were not. 2 Second, unlike in the other countries, we asked UK and US respondents about an app that might use GPS data in addition to Bluetooth. Third, in the US survey, which was run last, we included a question explicitly asking respondents which installation regime (opt-in or opt-out) they preferred. We did this in order to check the consistency between their actual preferences for installation regimes and their installation intentions under each regime elicited in Parts 2 and 3. We also added demographic questions about ethnicity, area of residence, health insurance and media use, as well as two versions of a question about willingness to install if a private company like Facebook endorsed it.

No personal data was collected at any point during the survey and we obtained informed consent as well as checked for bots before the survey began. Respondents who accepted the survey invitation were directed to our online questionnaire, programmed using the software Qualtrics. The survey was pretested before fielding by generating test observations (around 4000 iterations for each country) to check data quality and consistency. Moreover, we always had a soft launch before the full launch. That is, after collecting the first 100 responses, we paused recruitment and checked the data before launching the survey widely. No adjustments had to be made in any of the countries. Our survey was not password protected but distributed through an open link, so in principle respondents could take part multiple times. However, the panel provider Lucid assigns a unique ID to each respondent which we tracked within the survey, which allowed us to identify and exclude multiple entries from the same respondent. Only a very small number of respondents completed the survey more than once; see Section B.2 for more details. Throughout the survey, respondents were allowed to navigate back and forth between screens except for when adaptive questioning was used. Furthermore, we enforced responses in all questions but those about reasons for and against installation (as we did not want to force people in favor of/opposed to installation to give reasons against/for, respectively). Consequently, every participant who submitted the survey also replied to every question. We did give people the option to choose \"Don't know\" in response to all the installation questions (as well as a question about sick payment in the demographics part); however, since generally not many people chose it, we merged this option with the midpoint of the scale during data analysis. The entire survey was stretched over 17-23 screens (21-28 screens in the US), depending on the adaptive questioning, with 1-5 items per screen. The average completion time was 11.0 minutes in France, 9.7 minutes in Germany, 10.3 minutes in Italy, 8.7 minutes in the UK, and 12.6 minutes in the US.",

Volunteers were recruited using a multitude of methods, from double opt-in panels (the vast majority), publishing networks, social media, and other types of online communities. In some cases, participants were furthermore recruited offline e.g., via TV and radio ads, or with mail campaigns. Participation was voluntary and, in the majority of cases, incentivized with most suppliers providing loyalty reward points or gift cards, and some providing cash payments. In each country, we set recruitment quotas so as to achieve a sample of respondents that was representative of the adult population of the respective country with regard to gender, age and region of residence (quota-based sampling). Furthermore, we did not invite individuals who did not own a mobile phone. 3 Across the five countries, 10375 individuals started the survey, out of which 10308 consented to participate (a participation rate of 99%). Before participants could begin the main part of the survey, we briefly described the app, and asked three comprehension questions to ensure participants were paying adequate attention and not just (randomly) clicking through the survey. Only if all three comprehension question were answered correctly were respondents allowed to continue with the survey. Out of the people who consented to participate, 3983 failed to answer all three comprehension questions correctly, leaving us with a sample of 6166 respondents who started the main questionnaire. 105 of these respondents either exited the survey before submitting or took the survey more than once and were therefore excluded from the sample, 4 which left us with 6061 complete and unique responses (a completion rate of 59%). Finally, we dropped observations from 44 individuals who indicated in the comments section they did not own a smartphone, and 22 individuals who either did not identify as male or female, or who preferred not to disclose their gender. 5 This gave us a final sample of 5995 participants for whom we have responses to all questions. 3 A few respondents still noted that they did not have a smartphone in the comments section (as a reason for not installing the app) -we excluded those responses from our final sample. 4 For the few people who took the survey more than once, we kept their first submission. 5 Because there were so few people who either wanted to keep their gender private or identified as non-binary, it did not seem useful to have an extra category when analyzing the results by gender.",

From these partners, Lucid receives demographic information about the pool of potential participants and uses this information to target respondents in accordance with the quotas set for the survey. In our case, we targeted the gender and age composition as well as the regions of residence of the respondents to be representative of each country's overall population. After sending the survey out to an initial sample meeting these quotas, Lucid subsequently focuses on particular demographic groups in the re-sampling to meet the quotas in the final sample of participants (i.e., if initial take-up among people over the age of 60 was low, Lucid would disproportionately target them or even close data collection on younger cohorts completely after a while to ensure balance across age groups). However, while we tried to ensure that our sample was representative of each country's population in terms of gender, age and region of residence, the composition could still differ from the country averages in terms of other characteristics. Furthermore, respondents who are recruited online may be more tech savvy and willing to use a phone application than the average individual. This could potentially bias our estimates.",

First, we re-created our key figures using sampling weights to harmonize the characteristics of our sample with the German population at large. Our results remained generally consistent -see for example Figure 4 which depicts the re-weighted response likelihoods to the question \"How likely would you be to install the app on your phone\". However, if unobserved factors like tech savviness are not strongly correlated with demographics, then using survey weights alone is not enough to un-bias the results. As a second step, we also tested whether our results are robust to alternate recruitment methods. One week after the initial survey, we repeated our online survey twice, once again with Lucid and also with Forsa. Although both surveys were conducted online, Forsa, unlike Lucid, recruits its online panel members from a probability based, randomly selected telephone sample. 6 This offline recruitment process ensures that technical literacy and willingness to share data should play less of a role in the selection into the Forsa sample. We find almost exactly the same results in the replication survey, alleviating concerns about our original sample -see, for example, Figure 4 which depicts results for the question \"How likely would you be to install the app on your phone\". More details about the replication can be found in the German country report. 6 To recruit participants, Forsa randomly generates phone numbers, calls the respective households and invites them to participate in the survey. Due to the direct contact over the phone, the sample should contain neither bots, nor respondents with a dubious identity (due to fake identities or multiple sign-ups).",

Figure 7 displays the results of the opt-in installation question if we model the entire choice space as an ordered logit where high numbers indicate a lower probability of installing the app, so that negative coefficients here have a similar interpretation to positive coefficients in the linear probability model in the main part. We see that the results look very similar to the ones obtained with the main specification (see Figure 2 ).

Just as we have looked at the covariates determining the choice to either install or not the app voluntarily (opt-in) in Figure 2 , we can also look at the impact of different influencing factors on the decision to keep or immediately uninstall an automatically installed app (opt-out). Figure 8 displays the results if we once again dichotomize the outcome so that the dependent variable takes the value 1 if a respondent indicated that they would probably or definitely keep the app and 0 otherwise. We see that participants from the UK are relatively more likely to keep the app in this scenario while French respondents are less likely in comparison. As with the opt-in installation outcomes, the results are robust to using an ordered logit specification as well as using a probit or linear probability specification when the \"keep category\" only consists of people saying they would definitely keep the app. For brevity, these robustness checks are omitted here.

The fact that we do not find a strong effect generally could be due to a number of different factors. Firstly, death rates do not vary much across geographic areas once we remove New York and Northern Italy. Secondly, much of the rhetoric surrounding the severity of the disease is at the national, not sub-national level (again excluding New York and Northern Italy). Lastly, it is likely that the cartography of infections does not exactly follow the cartography of regions at our disposal.",

This is not the case for reasons against, where most respondents select only one reason regardless of their intention to install. These findings suggest the need to better explain the various ways in which the app might benefit a user and his or her surroundings. Figures 13 and 14 . While all reasons in favor of an installation appear to come somewhat evenly to people's minds, there is a strong clustering of reasons against the app around surveillance and security concerns as well as possible impacts on mental health. These reasons highlight the biggest concerns that would need to be addressed in the design and implementation of the app to make sure take-up would be sufficiently high. In addition to the common reasons displayed in Figures 13 and 14 , we also gave a few answer options, which differed by country. In the UK, respondents were given \"Don't want the NHS to have access to my location data\" as an additional reason against, which was replaced by \"I don't want to activate Bluetooth\" in the other surveys. Germans in particular, were quite hesitant to activate Bluetooth, making it the third most popular reason against installation there. In the French, German, Italian and US surveys, respondents were given \"Would allow me to return to normal life faster \" as an additional reason in favor -however, it was not chosen by many people. Finally in the US survey the additional reason against \"No one else will use the app\" was the second most popular reason, given by 40% of respondents.",

However, Figure 1 shows that instead fewer people indicate they would keep the app rather than voluntarily download it.

We further asked respondents who did not say they would definitely comply, whether their chances of compliance would increase, decrease, or remain the same if the health services in their own country committed to test them quickly. In all countries, a commitment to quick testing would further increase compliance rates. This implies that the vast majority of people in all five countries are not only prepared to have the app installed on their phones, but also to use it as intended, even if this means sacrificing (more of) their personal freedom for a limited amount of time. 8 8 As this survey asks hypothetical questions, we should caveat that actual compliance might be considerably lower.",

Some of these surveys did not explain the app in as much detail as our survey and these surveys often find lower willingness to install. For example, infratest Dimap asked respondents between 30 and 31 March 2020 about their willingness to install a contact-tracing app, and found that only 47% of respondents were willing to install the app. 9 The comparison between our surveys and these shorter surveys suggests that a detailed explanation of how the app works and how it could mitigate or stop the epidemic increases the willingness to install. 9 The exact question (translated from German) was: \"Assume that there is an app for your mobile phone that would allow you to track your COVID-19 symptoms as well as document your geolocation data. The app could thus show all users whether they had been close to a person infected with the coronavirus. Would you use such an app or not?\" 39 .
