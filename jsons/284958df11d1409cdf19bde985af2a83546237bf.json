Scientists have proposed that many important infections emerged in the period following the advent of agriculture, as a result of newly dense populations and novel proximity to domestic animals that served as reservoirs for novel pathogens. Here, we review genomic evidence regarding pathogen origins, analyzing these data using the epidemiological transi-tion framework. Genetic information has forced us to reconsider how and when many important pathogens emerged; it appears that a number of infections thought to result from contact with domesticated animals arose much earlier than agriculture was adopted. We also consider the broader effect of agriculture upon the microbiome, exploring potential consequences for human health.

Ideally, the ability to cultivate crops and raise farm animals results in better health by providing an abundant source of food. A food surplus means that not everyone in a society has to be directly involved in food production, which facilitates the rise of religion and specialist crafts (Brumfiel and Earle, 1987; Hopfenber and Pimpentel, 2001) . This, in turn, allows the development of some of the finer things, like art, music, and great literature (Mithen, 1996) . It also allows individuals to focus exclusively on activities that serve society, such as public safety, scientific research, road maintenance, and healthcare. In a sense, all of these things are a consequence of agricultural production. For this reason, the long period that predated agriculture has often been viewed as a dark chapter in human history.

Why? The first answer is the sheer number of humans it supports. Archeological evidence indicates that throughout the Paleolithic, which began 2.6 million years ago, hominid populations were small, widely dispersed, and stable. This changed when agriculture allowed people to aggregate in settlements. At first, these settlements were small. For example, the early agricultural villages spread over four acres at Jarmo (9,000 years before present, or YBP), in the Iraqi foothills of the Zagros Mountains, housed just over 150 people (Braidwood and Braidwood, 1950) . The urban centers that followed were much larger. As long ago as 4,500 YBP, Ur in Mesopotamia had a population of 350,000 (Woolley, 1965) , while a population of 100,000 people was estimated for the Valley of Mexico 2,800 YBP (Sjoberg, 1965) . Following the Neolithic Revolution (8,000 YBP), there was a nearly sixteen-fold increase over Mesolithic population size (Deevey, 1960) . Dense population centers facilitated the spread of novel human infections; many \"crowd\" diseases need a continuous supply of susceptible individuals to infect, or the chain of transmission breaks and they disappear. It has been estimated that the measles virus, for instance, requires a population of at least 300,000 individuals in order to maintain transmission (Grenfell and Bolker, 1998) . With the rise of cities that followed the adoption of agriculture, these new \"crowd\" diseases could sustain themselves.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 641, "end": 672, "text": "(Braidwood and Braidwood, 1950)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 797, "end": 812, "text": "(Woolley, 1965)", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 901, "end": 916, "text": "(Sjoberg, 1965)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1054, "text": "(Deevey, 1960)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1448, "text": "(Grenfell and Bolker, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The second answer is that agriculture put humans and the animals they had domesticated in close contact. Over the years, researchers noticed that smallpox appears very similar to cowpox and measles appears very similar to rinderpest, a disease of cattle. In fact, some researchers believe that almost every major human infectious disease has an animal source (Diamond, 1997; Weiss, 2001) . It has been estimated that domesticated and peri-domesticated animals are the source of at least 184 different zoonotic diseases (McNeill, 1976; Palmer et al., 1998; Weiss, 2001) . As a result of new proximity, it is believed that many infections hopped from animals to humans, sometimes becoming permanent fixtures in their new hosts (Wolfe et al., 2007) .

At sites all over the globe, an increase in the telltale marks of both infection and nutritional deficiencies upon the skeleton are evident after the advent of agriculture ( Fig. 1) (Cohen and Armelagos, 1984, 2013; Steckel and Rose, 2002) . In addition, the age at death began to decline in populations that had adopted agriculture (Goodman and Armelagos, 1988; Steckel, 2005; Armelagos et al., 2009; Cohen and Armelagos, 2013) . Not all investigators are convinced that agriculture resulted in increased mortality (Gage, 2005; Gage and DeWitte, 2009) , and Pinhasi and Stock (2011) have even demonstrated that some transitions to agriculture were accompanied by improvements in health. Researchers have also questioned whether the \"osteological paradox\"-or the disconnect between indicators of pathology in skeletal samples and the frequency of these conditions in the living populations from which they came-may make drawing conclusions about health in past populations problematic (Wood et al., 1992) . However, studies of skeletal samples have shown that individuals who experience stress in early life die earlier, on average, contradicting a central tenet of the osteological paradox: that healthier people have \"sicker\" bones, because they do not succumb to illnesses before developing skeletal lesions (Goodman and Armelagos, 1988; Armelagos et al., 2009) . Both theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that it is valid to compare relative pathology frequencies between two or more large skeletal samples, allowing us to infer that health really does appear to have suffered at many post-agriculture sites (Goodman, 1993; Cohen, 1994; Steckel and Rose, 2002) . Why should this be the case? Throughout history, humans have used 5,000 plants as foods (Reid and Miller, 1989) . Of these, only 150 have become major products of world commerce. As of the end of the 20th century, only 20 species provided most of the world's food, with wheat, rice, and corn contributing 69% of calories and 56% of protein (Reid and Miller, 1989) . Agricultural communities that rely heavily on a few crops often experience compromised nutrition that predisposes their residents to infection (Mensforth et al., 1978; Scrimshaw, 2003 Scrimshaw, , 2010 Cohen and Armelagos, 2013) .

Over thirty years ago, Omran (1971) introduced the concept of the epidemiological transition, describing three successive stages in human history: 1) The Age of Pestilence and Famine; 2) the Age of Receding Pandemics; and 3) the Age of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases. New evidence that a relatively healthy, pre-agricultural time period existed before Omran's \"Age of Pestilence and Famine\" necessitated an important revision to this model. Barrett et al. (1998) realized that rather than representing the baseline, Omran's first stage, sparked by the transition to agriculture, instead represented the first epidemiological transition that humanity underwent. Sprent (1969a,b) has suggested that human pathogens can generally be grouped into two broad categories: those caused by \"heirloom\" pathogens, which infected our anthropoid ancestors, and those caused by \"souvenir\" pathogens, which have been acquired more recently in human history. These latter diseases were generally zoonoses at first, infections transmitted from animals to humans (Kilks, 1990) . Zoonoses can be contracted via insect or animal bites or through the hunting, preparation, and consumption of an infected animal. After a zoonotic pathogen enters a human host, several results are possible. If the pathogen finds humans to be unsuitable hosts, it may never spread beyond the initial infected individual or the transmission chain may be very short.

As Livingstone predicted, for years the closest genetic relative of P. falciparum that geneticists could identify was P. reichenowi (Escalante and Ayala, 1994) , a parasite found in chimpanzees. For decades, all we knew about this parasite came from a single strain isolated from a chimpanzee in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Collins et al., 1986) . On this basis, it seemed reasonable to believe that humans and chimpanzees both harbored their own distinct \"heirloom\" malaria strains. This would mean that malaria was an ancient infection in humans, predating agriculture by millions of years. Around 2009, our understanding of P. falciparum's history in humans began to change, as the results of intensive studies of malaria infections in NHPs were reported. The ability to obtain Plasmodium DNA from NHP feces revolutionized the ability of scientists to collect samples for sequencing. And as these new sequences poured in, it began to appear that malignant malaria was not an heirloom pathogen of humans after all. Sequence analysis showed that the global genetic diversity of human P. falciparum strains was very low relative to the diversity present in chimpanzee P. reichenowi strains, indicating that the human species had diverged more recently than the chimpanzee species (Rich et al., 2009 ). This finding was inconsistent with P. falciparum being an heirloom pathogen in humans. Moreover, a genetic study of nearly 3,000 wild great apes, including chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos from throughout central Africa, found that the strains most closely related to human P. falciparum were found in gorillas rather than chimpanzees (Liu et al., 2010) .

The treponematoses leave telltale marks upon the skeleton, and, as a result, they have been studied intensively by paleopathologists. In the New World, there is clear skeletal evidence that treponemal disease was present both prior to and after agriculture came to dominate the food economy (Powell and Cook, 2005) . However, whether or not treponemal disease in the Old World predated the advent of agriculture is unclear. Many historians and physical anthropologists have argued, on the basis of written records and skeletal patterns of disease, that syphilis was introduced into Europe by Columbus and his men (Baker and Armelagos, 1988; de Isla, 1539; andez de Oviedo y Valdes, 1526; er et al., 2011) .

However, due to a number of factors, including a lack of knowledge regarding substitution rates among these bacteria, we could not use these genetic data to determine whether the early divergence of yaws-causing strains occurred pre-or postagriculture. Genetic studies have also demonstrated that strains of T. pallidum collected from wild African NHPs closely resemble human yaws-causing strains, so much so that it appears they should all be considered members of a single species (Harper et al., 2012; Harper and Knauf, 2013; Zobanikova et al., 2013) . However, current genetic data are compatible with several scenarios, including: 1) that African primate species, including humans, have each evolved with their own T. pallidum strains, which would mean that yaws predates agriculture in the Old World or 2) that human yaws infection was originally acquired from NHPs, which could have occurred pre-or post-agriculture.

The composition of the microbiome appears to be exquisitely sensitive to what we eat; for example, strains of Bacteroides plebius obtained from Japanese subjects frequently harbor a gene capable of degrading the porphyran in edible seaweed, while this gene is absent in North American strains (Hehemann et al., 2010) .

Wu et al.

Thus, one might hypothesize that the increased carbohydrate levels associated with the advent of agriculture would have increased the proportion of Prevotella species in the microbiome while decreasing Bacteroides levels. In addition, a decrease in the variety of foods consumed may have resulted in a loss of microbiome diversity. And as humans and animals spent more time in close proximity, one might predict that their microbiomes would begin to resemble one another.

Although less studied, the yeast composition of the gut may also change in response to diet. A study of a Wayampi community in the Amazon found that Candida albicans carriage, normal in western countries, was unusual, and that Wayampi individuals were colonized by yeast species only rarely observed in the West (Angebault et al., 2013) . These observations may be due to differences in the yeast strains acquired via diet.

Newborn infants are more or less germfree, but as soon as babies leave their mothers' bodies, this begins to change. While vaginally delivered babies develop microbiota that mirror their mother's vaginal microbiota, babies delivered via C-section harbor microbiomes that resemble those found on the skin's surface (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010) . Differences in the microflora linked to delivery mode persist even in seven-yearold children (Penders et al., 2006) .

Estimates should come from a relevant species, and as we have learned in recent years, it is also important that they are obtained over a time period similar to the one of interest. Substitution rates that are estimated over shorter evolutionary time periods are significantly higher than those that accumulate between species over greater time periods, making the molecular clock time-dependent (Ho et al., 2005) . An example of the importance of calibration comes from research on Shigella, the bacterium responsible for dysentery. One early study used methods standard at the time to estimate divergence times for the various Shigella lineages and determined that they had emerged well before agriculture, which would make dysentery one of the early infectious diseases of humans (Pupo et al., 2000) . However, a recent study, which used a combination of old and new isolates and paid special attention to molecular clock calibration, suggests that Shigella sonnei infection is a relatively recent phenomenon, having emerged within the last 500 years in Europe, from whence it expanded across the world (Holt et al., 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 967, "end": 984, "text": "(Ho et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1373, "text": "(Pupo et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1696, "text": "(Holt et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "LIMITATIONS OF USING GENOMIC EVIDENCE TO ELUCIDATE A MICROBE'S PAST"}, {"text": "Sampling has also proven a crucial determinant of a study's worth.

The history of agriculture and pathogens is rich with information about scenarios in which host switches to humans have occurred (Table 2) . Alternately, we can mine this history for scenarios in which pathogens jumped from humans to nearby species, which may have important implications for conservation and livestock management. Finally, we may be able to apply the methods developed studying pathogen crossspecies transfer events to better understand the exchange of non-pathogenic microbes between species. Future research should focus on areas where activities such as agriculture are changing patterns of contact between humans and animals. Increased sampling, sophisticated methods of microbial identification, and thorough genetic characterization will help us better understand when, where, and how microbes shift hosts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 505, "end": 525, "text": "(Jones et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 633, "end": 647, "text": "(Lipkin, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 762, "end": 782, "text": "(Jones et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1111, "end": 1120, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "CONCLUSION"}, {"text": "Although we have begun to appreciate the complexity of agriculture's effects upon the microbiome, we are still a long way from understanding how to use this knowledge to influence health. That antibiotics are problematic has become clear. Antibiotic resistance is continually growing, and extremely drug resistant strains of tuberculosis (often paired with HIV), Acinetobacter baumannii (found in intensive care units), Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumonia, and other bacteria are increasingly common and very difficult to treat (Gandhi et al., 2006; Park et al., 2009; Jacobsen et al., 2010; Frasson et al., 2012; Hendricksen et al., 2013) . Even when they work, the effect of antibiotics upon the entire microbiome is undesirable. As a result, alternatives to antibiotics, such as probiotics and phage therapy, are looking more and more appealing. There is still a long way to go before these therapies represent viable options for most infections, and our current regulatory system is not currently equipped to deal efficiently with approvals for these treatments. Nevertheless, preliminary studies of options such as fecal transplants to cure C. difficile (van Nood et al., 2013) and bacteriophage to treat drugresistant ear infections (Wright et al., 2009 ) are encouraging, and it is likely that antibiotic alternatives will be used more and more in the future. Will our understanding of the effects of the Western diet upon our microflora prove useful? Can pre-agricultural microbial communities serve as guides, providing a model composition to which we should aim to return? Which changes to the microbiome are essential adaptations to modern life, and which represent deleterious outcomes that must be fixed? These are important questions that remain to be answered.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 534, "end": 555, "text": "(Gandhi et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 556, "end": 574, "text": "Park et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 575, "end": 597, "text": "Jacobsen et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 598, "end": 619, "text": "Frasson et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 620, "end": 645, "text": "Hendricksen et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1188, "text": "(van Nood et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1265, "text": "(Wright et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSION"}, {"text": "The price of genetic sequencing has fallen dramatically.

Soon such projects are likely to yield whole genome sequence data. As we sequence more and more samples from more and more places, we are likely to gain a better understanding of the history of the microbes within and around us-and the role that agriculture has played in shaping these communities. A robust framework for understanding this influx of data will be needed. Well-developed concepts such as the epidemiological transition model and Sprent's heirloom and souvenir classification system, are likely to prove useful in this capacity. These models should be broadened to include important nonpathogens; recent research makes it clear that the distinction between pathogens and commensals is not a clear one and that non-pathogenic microbes have a large effect on health in their own right. A dialectical process in which our models are refined in the light of newly available sequence data and novel genetic information is processed through the lens of these conceptual frameworks may eventually help us 1) craft better interventions, ridding ourselves of problematic microbes without devastating entire ecosystems and 2) aid in preventing disastrous interspecies pathogen transfers. It is important to recognize that the effect of agriculture upon the human microbiome is still unfolding, with tainted meat, farm animals, and produce spreading E. coli 0157, mad cow disease, influenza, antibiotic-resistant infections, and Rift Valley fever (Lipkin, 2013 ) and individuals converting to the Western microbiome as highfat, highsugar, agriculture-based diets spread. This is an exhilarating time for scientists, as each passing year brings fascinating, and sometimes startling, insights into the history of our microbe-scape. It will be exciting to see how knowledge of our shared past with microbes shapes future interactions between us and them, especially as we have come to realize that the distinction between \"our\" cells and \"theirs\" is often blurry.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1600, "end": 1613, "text": "(Lipkin, 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSION"}], "bib_entries":
