New approaches are developing to improve the capacity of surveillance systems in detecting previously unknown threats. More recently, surveillance institutions have been actively searching for information about health threats using internet scanning tools, email distribution lists or networks that complement the early warning function of routine surveillance systems. Since its foundation, ECDC has developed an epidemic intelligence framework that encompasses all activities related to early identi fi cation of potential health hazards, their veri fi cation, assessment and investigation, in order to recommend public health control measures. Since June 2005, about 900 threats have been monitored by ECDC. Several threats made it necessary to develop formal risk assessments or to dispatch ECDC experts to outbreak areas. Examples of recent events, identi fi ed through the epidemic intelligence activity, are presented to illustrate the course of action from threat detection through risk management in Europe.",

As far as public health is concerned, the national public health institute of a member state, where existent, is in charge of risk assessment, including disease surveillance activities and outbreak investigation. Management aspects are usually handled by the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for prevention and control measures. These two institutions work closely together. Even though this is the most common model, this structure may vary between countries. At EU level, the European Commission is responsible for all management aspects of infectious diseases, whereas the ECDC is in charge of the assessment of public health threats and the provision of technical expertise to member states. In the area of crisis management, the European Commission and the specialised agencies of the EU maintain and support a number of monitoring and alert systems for threat detection, risk assessment, rapid alert and risk management (Table 7 .1 ) and platforms for crisis management, all of which provide means for information exchange and dissemination, as well as coordination with member states and international organizations ( Table 7 .2 ). The role and mandate of the ECDC regarding health threats is limited to risk monitoring, assessment and communication. In situations where a health threat affects more than one member state and a multi-country response is needed, public health measures are taken with joint efforts by the European Commission and the national authorities. The implementation of public health measures is the responsibility of member states according to their jurisdictional organisation. The role of an EU agency, such as the ECDC, is to provide expertise and technical support to risk managers when called on to do so. This can include evidence-based risk assessment and \"hands on\" support in investigating outbreaks.",

In their relationship with security sector and law enforcement authorities, public health services stress the importance of keeping public health high on the agenda in cases of a deliberate release of biological agents. However, in response to a health crisis resulting from a deliberate release of a biological agent, EU coordination is faced with two contradicting forces in the communication with the member states: on the one hand some member states would be requesting urgent advice, guidance and possibly assistance, while on the other hand there will be marked reluctance by the security sector to discuss sensitive information.",

The conclusion was that the detection of two autochthonous cases of dengue fever in France and the fi rst autochthonous case in Croatia were signi fi cant public health events, but not unexpected. The described events have been the fi rst locally acquired dengue cases reported in continental Europe since 1927-1928, when large dengue outbreaks occurred in Greece. All cases in 2010 occurred in areas known to be infested by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Previous events, including the chikungunya outbreak in Italy in 2007 [ 1 ] , the occurrence of vectorborne diseases around airports and other ports of entry, and a previous risk assessment on dengue introduction in the EU [ 15 ] indicate that autochthonous transmission of dengue in continental Europe is possible, as con fi rmed by these events. At the end of the period of mosquito activity, usually in October/November, the risk of establishment of sustained transmission of dengue in south-eastern France and in southern Croatia and further spread in Europe during 2010 appeared very limited. These two events highlighted the need to further strengthen vector monitoring, active surveillance for imported and autochthonous human cases, awareness of health care providers, and laboratory capacities, in countries where Aedes albopictus is present, and increase the effectiveness of rapid exchange of information among countries to identify threats and support the response.",
