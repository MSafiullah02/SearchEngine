The declaration of PES involves all residents and fellows at that institution and is governed Spine Surgery Education during COVID-19 Pandemic by four overriding requirements: work hour limit, adequate resources and training (trained in, and be provided with, appropriate infection protection for the clinical setting and situation), adequate supervision, and the ability to function in their core specialty (other work must be limited to 20 percent of their annual education time).",

These two teams remained completely isolated from each other to decrease the possibility of the entire program being exposed to the virus. The teams have two-week working cycles, which allows the team not on active duty to self-isolate and watch for the onset of symptoms during the potential incubation period. This method reduces the chance of transmitting the infection to other team members or patients.",
