The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene.",

The resulting alignments were visualized with the Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV) [19] . After removing PCR duplicates, SNVs were called with a Bonferroni-corrected P-value threshold of 0.05 using samtools [20] and LoFreq [21] . Variants supported by absolute read concordance (>98%) were filtered-out from intra-host variant frequency calculations. We annotated the variations to the reference strain using snpEff [22] , SNVs effects were further filtered with snpSift [23] and we estimated the average mutation rate per gene across the viral genome using R scripts. We compared the localization of the intra-host SNVs with all available SNVs observed at population level up to February 18 th 2020 (retrieved from www.GISAID.org). We also compared all intra-host and population level SNPs with all primers and probes coordinates to investigate for potential interferences with currently available molecular diagnostic assays [24] (www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/peiris-protocol-16-1-20.pdf).",

All samples analysed in this study were probably infected by the same viral strain since they shared the same set of consensus SNVs. However, apart from 3 intra-host SNVs that were common between SRR10903401 and SRR10903402, there was no other overlap observed between the low frequency variants of each sample (Figure 1-B) . This indicates that these variations have been occurred in a rather random fashion and are not subject of selective pressures, which is also supported by the fact that the missense mutations were systematically more, compared to the synonymous mutations. On the other hand, missense substitutions are more common in loci involving pathogen resistance, indicating positive selection [31] . The analysed viral RNA might have been originated from functional/packed virions, but also from unpacked viral genomes, which are unable to replicate and infect other host cells. Even if a viral genome is unable to replicate independently, its abundant presence in the pool of viral quasispecies implies some functionality regarding the intra-host evolution and adaptation. For example, defective viral genomes might affect infection dynamics such as viral persistence but also the natural history of an infection [32] - [34] . At the same time, these variants may arise rapidly during an outbreak and can be used for tracking the transmission chains and the spaciotemporal characteristics of the epidemic [35] - [37] . Studies involving large number of samples and in-vitro experiments on SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates are needed, in order to conclude whether these variations are advantageous or come with a fitness cost for the virus.",

            "text": "As it is well documented, recombination events lead to substantial changes in genetic diversity of RNA viruses [40] , [41] . In CoVs, discontinuous RNA synthesis is commonly observed, resulting in high frequencies of homologous recombination [42] , which can be up to 25% across the entire CoV genome [43] . For pathogenic HCoVs genomic rearrangements are frequently reported during the course of epidemic outbreaks, such as HCoV-OC43 [44] , and HCoV-NL63 [45] , SARS-CoV [46] [44] and MERS-CoV [47] . We have isolated intra-host genomic rearrangements, located in poly-A and poly-U enriched palindrome regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure 3, Suppl. Figure 1) . We have validated the majority of these events by visual inspection of the alignments. We conclude that these rearrangements do not represent artifacts derived from the NGS library preparation (e.g. PCR crosstalk artifacts), especially since all the supporting reads were not duplicated and, in some cases, differed in polymorphic positions (Suppl. Figure 2) .",

            "text": "Recombination processes involving S gene particularly, have been reported for SARSand SARS-like CoV but also for HCoV-OC43. In the case of sister species HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, recombination breakpoints are located near 3'-and 5'-end of the gene [1] [47] . S is a trimeric protein, which is cleaved into two subunits, the globular N-terminal S1 and the Cterminal S2 [48] . The S1 subunit consists of a signal peptide and the NT and receptor binding (RB) domains, with the latter sharing only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related CoVs. Our analysis revealed that similarly to other genomic regions, the S1 subunit hosts many low-frequency SNVs, characterized by higher density compared to the rest of the S gene sequence (Figure 1-E) . The S2 subunit is highly conserved, with 99% identity compared to human SARS-CoV and two bat SARS-like CoVs [9] . The S2 subunit consists of two fusion peptides (FP, IFP), followed by two heptad repeats (HR 1 and 2) , the pretransmembrane domain (PTM), the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain (TM, CP) [48] . In S gene, the same rearrangement event has taken place in two samples analyzed in this study. This observation highlights a potential recombination hot-spot in S gene. The rearrangement that was common between the two samples of this study is located in nt24,000 of the 2019-nCoV genome, which corresponds to the ~200nt linking region between the fusion peptides FP and IFP (aa 812-813). Examining closely the secondary structure of the RNA genome around the breakpoints, we suggest a model where the palindromes 5'-UGGUUUU-3' and 5'-AAAACCAA-3', have served as donor-acceptor sequences during the recombination event, since they are both exposed in the single-stranded internal loops formed in a highly structured RNA pseudoknot (Figure 3-C) . The RB domain of the S protein has been tested as a potential immunogen as it contains neutralization epitopes which appear to have a role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies [16] , [49] . It should be mentioned though that S protein of SARS-CoV is the most divergent in all strains infecting humans [50] , [51] , as in both C and N-terminal domains variations arise rapidly, allowing immunological escape [52] . Our findings support that apart from these variations, the N-terminal region also hosts a recombination hot-spot, which together with the rest of the observed rearrangements, indicates the genomic instability of SARS-CoV-2 over poly-A and poly-U regions. Prediction of the secondary structure of the genomic region spanning the rearrangement breakpoint (100 bases upstream and 100 bases downstream). The corresponding donor-acceptor sequences, exposed in internal loops, are indicated in green bars. I  II   I  II   I   II   5' 3' Base-pair probabilities 0 1 MFE secondary structure",
