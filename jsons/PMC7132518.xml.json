The morbidity and the risk of mortality may increase. Additional antimicrobial treatment can become necessary and the duration of hospital stay may be prolonged.3 (2) On the affected ward, the recognition of an outbreak often causes uncertainty about the outbreak's origin, the transmission route, and about appropriate infection control measures required to bring the outbreak to an end. Furthermore, almost every nosocomial outbreak will increase the costs for the affected medical department especially when a total closure of the unit is considered. That is why a total closure is performed only if all previous infection control measures have failed to control the pathogen's spread. This closure of the unit may comprise the immediate cessation of new admissions to the ward until disinfection of the ward has been carried out, but it may also include temporary cancellation of scheduled surgical operations or restriction of certain diagnostic procedures.4, 5, 6 Sometimes the extent of a closure may vary within the course of one single outbreak.7 (3) Publication of a nosocomial outbreak in public media may represent a threat for the reputation of the entire healthcare facility.",

In a retrospective cost analysis of a four-month outbreak caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) K. pneumoniae in a neonatal intensive care unit, approximately one-third of the total outbreak costs could be referred to the lost revenue from blocked patient beds.9 To avoid unnecessary expenses during an outbreak it is important to implement evidence-based and effective infection control recommendations to limit pathogen spread at the earliest possible stage.

However, most probably the majority of nosocomial outbreaks will not be published in the medical literature or will not even be recognized. Thus there will be some bias towards extraordinary species or towards common species that show a more antimicrobial-resistant phenotype. We believe that the large number of outbreaks filed already in the Outbreak Database balances this publication bias at least to some extent. (2) Some characteristics need a more detailed differentiation. For example, we cannot distinguish between the different kinds of hepatitis viruses, the various types of environmental source, or the sort of contact that occurred (direct or indirect by contaminated surfaces).",

It can therefore be used for education of staff to prevent the occurrence of an outbreak in the first place, but it may also be helpful when quick decisions need to be made during the investigation of a current epidemic.",
