            "text": "Background Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those institutions without such facilities or 2019-nCoV. This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model. Methods A 2019-nCoV-related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2V uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2V infection. The anti-viral activities and anti-viral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. Results The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs, including cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 mmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC 50 ] of 0.98 mmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 mmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 \u00b1 0.02] \u00c2 10 \u00c04 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 mmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP had potent anti-viral activities against both viral entry (0.46 \u00b1 0.12, vs.1.00 \u00b1 0.37 t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication ([6.18 \u00b1 0.95] \u00c2 10 \u00c04 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.43, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). Conclusions Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and further study of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.",

            "text": "A coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV was identified in a sample collected from Rhinolophus affinis bat in Yunnan in 2013, suggesting bats are likely the reservoirs of 2019-nCoV. [3] Recently, the searching of reservoirs or intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV turned to pangolins. Xiao et al [4] reported the isolation and characterization of a 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus from pangolins (Manis javanica). Similarly, in October 2019, a viral metagenomic study of pangolins identified severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-related sequences, [5] which can be re-identified as 2019-nCoV-related sequences. [6] Moreover, we also reported the isolation and identification of 2019-nCoV-related coronaviruses in pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. [7] Altogether, pangolins are likely a reservoir or an intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. [5] Due to its pathogenicity and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV, working with live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biocontainment facilities, which impedes the urgent needs for drug screening. Without prior experience of therapy, the current treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is mainly empirical and symptomatic, and a limited number of therapeutics in ongoing clinical trial were adopted from previous research on SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which are only remotely related with 2019-nCoV. With low or no pathogenicity in humans and close genetic relationship with 2019-nCoV, our pangolin coronavirus provides an ideal alternative model for 2019-nCoV research. Our reasoning of this isolate having low or no pathogenicity in humans was based on the fact that, back in 2017, no suspected infections were found in those having close contacts with pangolins; and our pangolin coronavirus isolate was routinely cultured in biosafety level 2 facilities. Here we present a screening of clinically approved drugs for anti-coronavirus activity in this 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model, and identify the potent inhibitors for pangolin coronavirus infection.",

[3, 10, 11] We next tested whether ACE2 is involved in pangolin CoV GX_P2V infection by using siRNA-mediated knockdown of ACE2 expression. In Vero E6 cells treated with 0.8, 4, and 20 nmol/L concentrations of ACE2-targeting siRNAs, the yields of ACE2 mRNA and viral RNA were all significantly reduced, suggesting that ACE2 expression was knocked down by siRNA [ Figure 1B] and ACE2 was also a receptor of 2019-nCoVr GX_P2V [ Figure 1C ]. It appears that ACE2 is a conserved receptor of both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV-related viruses. It is noted, however, that having a possible receptor of ACE2 does not correlate to viral pathogenicity. In fact, no human infection relating to our pangolin CoV was identified or suspected, suggesting that CoV GX_P2V is nonpathogenic in humans. Altogether, the close relationship to 2019-nCoV, the shared receptor and non-pathogenicity, support that pangolin CoV GX_P2V can be used as an accessible in vitro model for developing therapies against 2019-nCoV. Among the three drug candidates, CEP is of particular attention due to its profound anti-viral activity and previous reports of its inhibitory effects on both SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. [12, 13] Figure 3A ]. We next investigated this drug's anti-viral mechanism by conducting viral entry, post-entry, and fulltime assays in 12 well plates [ Figure 3B ]. In the viral entry assay, cells were incubated with media containing both viruses and CEP during the first 2 h of infection, then were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were supplemented with media containing no drugs. In the viral postentry assay, cells were incubated in media containing no CEP during the first 2 h of infection, then were supplemented with media containing CEP. In the viral full-time assay, cells were constantly incubated in media containing CEP. Viral RNA yields were determined by qRT-PCR at 48 h p.i. Compared to normal infections without drug treatment, the viral RNA yields in the entry, post-entry and full-time assays were 2.17-fold (0.46 \u00b1 0.12 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.37, t = 2.42, P < 0.01), 1618-fold (6.18 \u00b1 0.95 vs. [1.00 \u00b1 0.43] \u00c2 10 \u00c04 , t = 3.98, P <0.001), and 12,459-fold (4.58 \u00b1 1.27 vs.",

We then identified three clinically approved drugs (CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride) that can inhibit a 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus infection, and suggested that these drugs be considered for further investigation in the treatment of 2019-nCoV infection. Our finding of CEP as a potential drug for 2019-nCoV is especially instructive. This drug is an anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic alkaloid and is approved for leukopenia. It has multiple functions, such as inhibiting the efflux transporter ABCC10 of anti-tumor drugs, [14] inhibiting the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by reducing plasma membrane fluidity, [15] and binding to central portion of heat shock protein 90. [16] Importantly, as a naturally occurring plant alkaloid with more than 40 years of clinic use, CEP has low toxicity in animals and has no significant side effects in humans. [17, 18] Given the observed strong inhibition of virus replication and the drug's established role of anti-inflammatory response, we think CEP is a promising candidate for the treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.",

Infected cells without any drug treatment showed typical CPE-cell rounding with no obvious lysis. Importantly, three drugs, CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of CPE in infected cells [SupplementaryFigure 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A217]. The viral RNA level in the infected cells treated with 10 mmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than that in infected cells without drug treatment (1.00 \u00b1 0.12 vs. [6.48 \u00b1 0.02] \u00c2 10 \u00c04 , t = 150.38, P < 0.001) [Figure 2B].
