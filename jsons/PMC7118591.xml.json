The doctors in the fever clinic can conduct preliminary screening of the patients by tracing the contact history and the exposure history of patients in areas with COVID-19 outbreaks and can determine each patient's degree of suspicion. Patients with suspected COVID-19 infection should be guided and carefully transferred from the fever clinic to the medical imaging department through the fast track for examination to reduce their movement range and avoid transmission to others.
