The proposed work aims to suggest an automated image processing scheme to extract the COVID-19 lesion from the lung CT scan images (CTI) recorded from the patients. This scheme implements the following procedures; (i) Image pre-processing to enhance the COVID-19 lesions, (ii) Image post-processing to extract the lesions, and (iii) Execution of a relative analysis between the extracted lesion segment and the Ground-Truth-Image (GTI). This work implements Firefly Algorithm and Shannon Entropy (FA+SE) based multi-threshold to enhance the pneumonia lesion and implements Markov-Random-Field (MRF) segmentation to extract the lesions with better accuracy. The proposed scheme is tested and validated using a class of COVID-19 CTI obtained from the existing image datasets and the experimental outcome is appraised to authenticate the clinical significance of the proposed scheme. The proposed work helped to attain a mean accuracy of >92% during COVID-19 lesion segmentation and in future, it can be used to examine the real clinical lung CTI of COVID-19 patients.",

Most of these earlier works are combined the RT-PCR along with the imaging procedure to confirm and treat the disease [9, [18] [19] [20] . The CTI is commonly used as the prescribed modality and the axial as well as the coronal views are analyzed to detect the severity of the infection and based on the outcome, effective treatment is suggested to treat the disease with suitable drug. The recent work of Rajinikanth et al. [27] developed a computer assisted methodology to assess the COVID-19 lesion using the lung CTI of coronal-view using a series of procedures. This work implemented few operator assisted steps to achieve superior outcome during the COVID-19 evaluation.",

In a real-time situation, lung infection due to COVID-19 initiated pneumonia is evaluated by a skilled doctor and based on the suggestion; probable healing actions are suggested and implemented to reduce the infection level. The personal recognition using a doctor will be a tedious job when the number of patients is more and hence, it is essential to propose a computerized image examination practice to assist the physician during the pneumonia diagnosis. This scheme will significantly lessen the diagnostic burden of the physician and will assist the physician to track the changes in the lesions (reduction/progress in infection) when the treatment is implemented.",

The structure of the proposed examination procedure is depicted in Figure 1 . Initially, the essential two-dimensional (2D) slices of the CTI (gray scale) are collected for the examination. The organ of interest is the lung and in the CTI, the lung is associated with various artifact sections, such as the heart, bone and other body parts and these artifacts are to be removed for the efficient assessment of lung and its infection. In this research, the stripping methodology discussed by Palani et al. [30] and Rajinikanth et al. [31] is executed to remove the artifacts with a bi-level threshold filter. The separated lung segment is then considered for image pre-processing and post-processing methodology. The image pre-processing step implements a three-level threshold to separate the image into; the background, normal lung section and the pneumonia lesion. In this work, the image enhancement is achieved using the Firefly-Algorithm (FA) guided Shannon-Entropy (SE) thresholding. The enhanced pneumonia lesion in the lung is then extracted by implementing Markov-Random-Field (MRF) segmentation. Finally, the extracted COVID-19 lesion is compared against the Ground-Truth-Image (GTI) and based on the attained performance values; the superiority of the proposed image processing tool is confirmed.
