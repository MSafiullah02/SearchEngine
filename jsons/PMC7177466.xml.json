One major challenge faced by emergency nurses amid an EID outbreak is the elevated but unpredictable risk of infection. For example, the infectious status of most of the attendees in the AED is unknown. This uncertainty increases the risk of exposure to frontline emergency nurses compared with that of other healthcare professionals during an epidemic event [7]. In addition to the occupational risks associated with EIDs, a well-reported challenge encountered by emergency nurses is adapting to the changes in the existing guidelines and recommendations for addressing a particular EID [8,9,10]. Studies have highlighted that emergency nurses are required to frequently and rapidly adjust their practice in accordance with amendments to infection control guidelines, even if such amendments are subtle and/or implicit [8,9]. The literature suggests that the antecedents of these challenges could be consequential to the uncertainty and changes experienced by emergency nurses in the workplace during an outbreak: changes and uncertainty within the work environment thus seem to be major and primary barriers to the emergency nursing practice [10].",

            "text": "The present study was conducted in Hong Kong during the period of January 2015 to January 2018. A qualitative study was designed to explore the perceptions and experiences of emergency nurses during epidemic events. The grounded theory approach [13] was selected to facilitate the interactive process of data collection and analysis. Grounded theory attempts to understand the involvement of individuals through the exploration and interpretation of their perspectives and meaning within a social phenomenon [14]. This approach prioritises the interpretation of interactions among individuals within the embedded realities of a phenomenon, which offers insight into the elements that shape their beliefs and actions [15]. In addition, this study adopted the Straussian framework of grounded theory data collection and analysis that was developed by Anselm Strauss and Juliet Corbin [13]. The Straussian framework offers explicit and well-defined analytical steps for data analysis with the provision of a coding paradigm. This paradigm facilitates the discovery of associations among conditions, interactions and consequences [13]. The detailed framework of data interpretation supports the procedural operations of the data analysis process, which might help to establish the plausibility and completeness of the findings while preserving the intertwined and dynamic nature of the data [16]. This study thus used the Straussian framework to help gain an in-depth comprehension of the strategies adopted by emergency nurses to address uncertainty and changes in EID management.",

            "text": "In line with the grounded theory approach, the participants in this study were recruited using a combination of purposive and theoretical sampling strategies. A purposive sampling strategy was used initially to recruit the first 10 participants. This strategy allowed for participants to be selected from the relevant population according to an initial set of criteria [17]. For inclusion, the participants had to be a full-time registered nurse in an emergency department in Hong Kong, Cantonese, English-speaking and willing to participate in the study and share their experiences. After initial recruitment, additional participants were solicited using a theoretical sampling strategy. This sampling strategy uses a systematic and cumulative participant recruitment method and is considered to be the major impetus to the progression of data collection and analysis in grounded theory studies [13]. Theoretical sampling is an iterative process wherein the participant recruitment and data collection processes are driven and performed according to the concepts alluded by the previous data [17]. It enables the ongoing development and elaboration of preliminary concepts and categories that emerge in the data analysis process and thus grants greater representativeness to the findings [18,19]. In general, participant recruitment by theoretical sampling is continued until theoretical saturation is achieved, i.e., when no additional relevant information emerges from the data analysis and the concepts and categories are amply unfolded to display patterns of properties and dimensions [20]. In the present study, the repetition of concepts and categories continued after data had been collected from and analysed for 26 participants, when no additional concepts or categories were yielded. The participant demographic information is summarised in Table 1.",

According to the findings, the uncertainties surrounding the workplace environment amid epidemic-created obstacles for emergency nurses, preventing them from performing and adopting the skills and tactics required to handle EID management tasks in a fully prepared manner. To address this problem, emergency nurses attempt to obtain information regarding an encountered situation, which involves information about the disease and specific guidelines in response. Acquiring precise information during an EID event is essential for nurses as it provides them with the relevant facts, such as disease identification, management and prevention. In addition, effective information provision could strengthen nurses\u2019 capacity to offer health promotion and health education in the community, which could help calm public fears about EIDs [21]. Despite the importance of the swift provision of epidemic information, the emergency nurses included in this study noted that the disease information they receive might be temporary or incorrect, and such erroneous information can lead to confusion and conflict in practice. In fact, similar problems regarding issuing unreliable information during epidemics have been reported in previous studies [22,23]. These findings indicate the need for healthcare facility administration and management to review and revise the effectiveness of current information dissemination strategies and systems. The findings of this study suggest that healthcare administrators should not merely disseminate information among nurses across services but should also appropriately streamline information to facilitate its integration into routine practice.",

As frequently reported in the literature, changes in the workplace typically create tension for an organisation\u2019s stakeholders, including those who decide to initiate the changes and those who are required to implement the changes [26]. Changes in the general clinical context of EID management can have a considerable impact on the usual practice, expectations and work practices of the nurses. For instance, a change of the disease situation might induce structural changes in the workplace, which, in turn, might require nurses to change a well-adapted and accepted behaviour or working style to a new and unfamiliar practice. These changes might induce insecurity and create further uncertainty among nurses [27]. Other workplace changes might pose challenges to nurses\u2019 practice. For example, an increase in workload might increase the likelihood of mistakes being made during practice [28].

This finding is in line with those of previous studies, showing that changes made within healthcare facilities might not always be in line with the ability of healthcare workers to adjust [29,30].

These altered duties and new tasks are often considered by emergency nurses to be far beyond their originally perceived scope of practice. For instance, nurses might be required to shoulder the responsibility of public health surveillance during an EID event, including case ascertainment and contact tracing, which could be perceived by emergency nurses as an extra duty outside of their usual domain of practice. To strengthen the capability of emergency nurses in subsequent epidemics, education and training should be provided to equip them with the relevant skills, knowledge and attitudes required to effectively perform their duties in the unprecedented circumstances of an EID outbreak. The training and education that is provided in hospitals to prepare emergency nurses for EID management is often focused on instilling the technical knowledge and skills required to implement infection control measures, such as hand hygiene practices or PPE use [32]. The provision of training and practice in the acquisition and augmentation of decision-making and problem-solving abilities may be overlooked. Thus, in addition to technical skills, we propose that education and training should place equal emphasis on developing nurses\u2019 cognitive skills, such as critical thinking.

In addition to factual information, emergency nurses are often required to gather first-hand information through everyday practice to assist them in comprehensively assessing the situations they encounter. When addressing their duties and responsibilities, it is important for emergency nurses to demonstrate critical thinking, flexibility and adaptability. To reinforce the preparedness of emergency nurses, learning by practical experience, which preserves the essence of clinical wisdom, should be taken into account as it is an efficient approach to train emergency nurses in EID management.",
