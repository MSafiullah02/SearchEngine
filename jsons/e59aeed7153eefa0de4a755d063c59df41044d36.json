The peritoneum is the largest and most complexly arranged serous membrane in the body. It forms the lining of the peritoneal cavity, which extends in abdominal cavity and contains the gastrointestinal tract; major abdominal organs, such as the liver, spleen, pancreas, urinary bladder, ovaries, and uterus; and many nerves, vessels, and lymph nodes. The peritoneum extends caudally in the pelvic cavity in males and females (as vaginal tunic and vaginal process, respectively). It is a serous membrane, divided into the parietal peritoneum, which covers the inner surface of the abdominal wall (the abdominal fascia) and the pelvic and scrotal cavities; the visceral peritoneum, which covers the abdominal, pelvic, and scrotal organs; and the connecting peritoneum, which extends between organs or between an organ and the parietal peritoneum, forming peritoneal folders that are divided into mesenteries, omenta, and ligaments. The purpose of the peritoneum is to provide a frictionless surface over which the viscera can move. It also serves as a site of fluid transport. A capillary film of serous fluid separates the parietal and visceral layers of the peritoneum from one another and lubricates the peritoneal surfaces. The retroperitoneal region extends dorsal to the peritoneal and pelvic cavities from the diaphragm to the pelvic inlet. It is bordered dorsally by the vertebrae and paraspinal muscles and laterally by the muscular abdominal and pelvic walls. The kidneys, ureters, and adrenal glands are considered to be retroperitoneal organs. The descending aorta, caudal vena cava, lumbar lymph nodes, cisterna chili, lymphatics, fat, and much of the abdominal wall musculature are also are also located in the",

Early detection of peritoneal changes is essential for the management of several neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions in veterinary patients. Contrast-enhanced MDCT scans with near-isotropic or isotropic resolution are necessary for fine evaluation of the abdominal cavity in dogs and cats. Most peritoneal and retroperitoneal pathological processes originate in the peritoneal and retroperitoneal organs. Therefore, a multiphasic approach (including the arterial phase and portal venous phase) provides adequate results in most instances. Performance of a third delayed series may be helpful for interpretation of pelvic pathological processes (e.g., prostatic, rectal, and vaginal diseases).",

Secondary septic peritonitis in dogs and cats results from gastrointestinal rupture (perforation, rupture, and surgical dehiscence), intraabdominal (hepatic, pancreatic, splenic, and prostatic) abscess, pyometra rupture, and penetrating injury. Noninfectious secondary chemical peritonitis can be caused by contact of irritants with the peritoneum in cases of urinary tract disruption (sterile uroabdomen); bile leakage caused by gallbladder rupture, hepatic torsion, or hepatobiliary surgical complication (bile peritonitis); and pancreatic disruption with leakage of exocrine pancreatic secretions (sterile bile peritonitis) (Figs. 2, 3, and 4).",

Smooth uniform thickening is the prevalent pattern in most cases of acute peritonitis. Granulomatous peritonitis can show a diffuse nodular pattern that may mimic a malignant condition (Fig. 5) .

The liver and gallbladder are herniated most frequently, followed by the small intestines, spleen, and stomach. PPDH may be diagnosed using first-level imaging techniques. However, MDCT can have a determinant role in the assessment of concomitant thoracic and abdominal congenital defects and embryonic variants in these subjects, which may change the therapeutic approach and prognosis.",

Indirect inguinal hernia is generally congenital and refers to the herniation of tissue into the inguinal canal through the deep inguinal ring in the tunica vaginalis.

In humans, MDCT is considered to be the gold standard imaging technique for the diagnosis of these hernias. The most common presentation is acute intestinal obstruction of small bowel loops, which develops through normal or abnormal apertures, such as foramina or defects in the mesentery or visceral peritoneum. MDCT signs differ depending on the subtype of internal hernia. These hernias result in the abnormal positioning of the stomach and/or bowel loops, which show signs of obstruction or strangulation. High-quality MDCT images obtained using a multiphasic approach are necessary for the evaluation of the mesenteric vasculature, which can show engorgement, twisting, and stretching (Fig. 33) . Volumetric datasets must be assessed thoroughly to exclude inflammatory and neoplastic gastrointestinal conditions. Thin-slab MIP and VR are helpful for accurate image interpretation, especially for evaluation of the course and patency of the mesenteric vasculature.",
