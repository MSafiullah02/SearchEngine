Infections with GI nematodes were considered to be mainly important in first-season grazing calves but studies have demonstrated that subclinical GI-nematode infections can impair milk yield in adults (Gross et al., 1999, Sanchez et al., 2004b). The major problem however is to identify the herds where the infection level is high enough to justify an anthelmintic treatment (Vercruysse and Claerebout, 2001).",

However, some studies suggest that O. ostertagi in cattle can provoke a non-specific immune suppression, reducing the ability of the animal to respond to heterologous antigens and increasing general susceptibility to disease (Wiggin and Gibbs, 1989, Hawkins, 1993). As a result, a high herd exposure to GI nematodes could increase the mortality of post-weaning calves, heifers and adult cows, and reduce fertility. Pre-weaned calves may also be affected by the absorption of antibody-poor colostrum. Another consequence of reduced weight gain in calves and heifers is an extended time in reaching breeding weight, thus involving reproductive costs.",

This approach has the advantage of evaluating the significance of association between each hypothesized factor and the likelihood of infection while simultaneously controlling for the confounding effect of other significant factors. Moreover, logistic regression does not need many of the restrictive assumptions that we had with linear regression (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989). Variable selection methods attempt to balance the goodness-of-fit of a model with considerations of parsimony. However this is done, in theory one could look at all possible logistic regression models to find the \u201cbest\u201d one, but this becomes computationally prohibitive when p is large. For this reason, it is more typical to use a stepwise procedure, where candidate models are based on adding or removing a term from the current \u201cbest\u201d model. A flaw in this approach is that it does not directly address the crucial balance of goodness-of-fit vs. parsimony. Akaike (1974) proposed a measure (AIC) based on information considerations that explicitly quantifies this balance (Sakamoto et al., 1986). Model selection using AIC does better, more often resulting in improved performance relative to using the full logistic regression model, particularly for smaller samples sizes (Perlich et al., 2003). Stepwise methods are used to find a model to fit data in situations where causality is not of interest. Forward selection is more likely than backward elimination to exclude predictors involved in suppressor effects. As such, a forward method runs a higher risk of making error (Field et al., 2012).",

            "text": "In our study, a relationship was found between the Ostertagia ODR herd score and age at the first calving suggesting that higher parasite infection levels in the herd had an adverse effect on reproductive performance. The negative impact of GI parasitism in body weight has been demonstrated in many studies and the effect of anthelmintic treatment on growth has been studied in dairy breeds (Shaw et al., 1998, Hawkins, 1993). It was observed that dewormed cows and heifers grazed 50\u201390 min longer per day than untreated controls (Forbes et al., 2004). The reduced appetite in the controls may be a result of the increased gastrin levels associated with the increased abomasal pH, which is in turn a result of damage to the parietal cells. Other reported effects of GI parasitism are alterations in the GI-tract motility, in GI secretions and in digestion and absorption (Fox, 1997). Ploeger et al. (1996) observed that the infection-induced differences in weight gain during the first grazing season appeared to be permanent, at least up to the end of the second grazing season. Moreover, first-lactation yield was positively correlated with body weight at calving. This suggests that nematode infections occurring in the first 2 years of life negatively influence milk production by reducing weight gains. In our study, the strong parasite challenge in the herds with high Ostertagia level must increase the time required to reach breeding weight in replacement heifers. These results suggested that Ostertagia ODR of adult cows could be used to formulate appropriate preventive measures in young stock, for example regular treatments on farms with high ODR levels and exposure of cows to calf-contaminated pasture.",

In contrast, some studies showed a reduction of the calving-to-conception interval was observed in anthelmintic treated cattle vs. placebo. Thus, in a Canadian study (549 cows in 20 herds) eprinomectin treated cows were significant lower calving-to-conception interval (117 days vs. 126 days)(Sanchez et al., 2002b). In the same study, ODR in milk was measured (109 cows) and the probability of conception was significantly lower for high-ODR cows compared to low-ODR cows. In a study using ivermectin in Australia, it was found that cows treated during the dry period had a 4.8 days shorter calving-to-conception interval than the untreated controls (430 cows in 5 herds) (Walsh et al., 1995). The same observation was made in France at the herd level in a study on 940 farms with an increased calving-to-conception interval of 1.5 days when the Ostertagia ODR measured on bulk tank milk increased from 0.482 to 0.720 (Guiot et al., 2007). In a study in Argentina all cows from a grass based dairy farm were followed monthly for egg parasite output in faeces and periodical bleedings for hormone determination were performed. Only a marginal effect on partum to first service interval were encountered but endocrine studies revealed a decrease in serum growth hormone (GH), type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and prolactin during lactation in cows with positive EPG in the first postpartum sample with respect to null EPG cows at that time (Perri et al., 2011). In contrast, a study in Canada (2381 cows in 35 herds) could not find a beneficial effect of eprinomectin treatment at calving on reproduction but the herds had a limited outdoor exposure (Sithole et al., 2006).",

No work has been published on the effect of Ostertagia status measured in bulk milk tank on mortality parameters, especially during the first year of life. In our study, a relationship was observed with multivariate approach in two classes: first 0\u201330 days and then 90\u2013365 days. The mortality in young calves could be explained by the poor quality of colostrum when dams were subjected to high parasite challenge. It seems that O. ostertagi can modulate the cattle's immune response, reducing the ability of the animal to respond to heterologous antigens (Wiggin and Gibbs, 1989). In addition, a study suggests a non-specific suppression of cellular immunity in O. ostertagi infected calves that were inoculated with Brucella abortus and IBR vaccines (Yang et al., 1993). However, a study of 103 cows in Belgium, Werbrouck et al. (2010) found no relationship between O. ostertagi ODR level in milk and concentration of immunoglobulin G in colostrum.",
