The chest X-ray showed bilateral patchy middle and lower field MRI of the brain and orbits and CT angiogram head and neck were normal. Transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable. Patient was not on medications that could potentially affect apixaban metabolism (e.g. P-glycoprotein and strong CYP3A4 inducers).

In this case, a cardioembolic etiology of the OAO was unlikely. Although multifactorial cardiomyopathy was described in Covid-19 8 , and our patient had developed right ventricle dilatation initially, the repeat echocardiogram at the time of the OAO showed normal cardiac chambers' sizes, valves and myocardial motility. Telemetry monitoring did not show arrhythmias and transcranial doppler ultrasound with bubble study demonstrated no cardiac shunt. Antiphospholipid antibodies in association with multiple cerebral and systemic infarctions was recently described in 3 COVID-19 patients 9 , however our patient had negative titers of these antibodies. In a recent report of 5 young patients with ischemic strokes and large vessels occlusion, the presumed 6 mechanisms were coagulopathy and vascular endothelial dysfunction and either antiplatelets or apixaban were begun 3 . The coagulopathy that COVID-19 patients develop may be unique and different from other virus-induced or sepsis related coagulopathy and considerable investigation remains to be done. Evidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in these patients suggest that pharmacologic anticoagulation prophylaxis for all hospitalized patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19, regardless of venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk should be considered; such prophylaxis is recommended by major societies 10,11 (e.g. American Society of Hematology, International Society of Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Anticoagulation Forum). A systematic review of 26 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 who were screened for VTE showed 100 % rate of VTE in patients who received prophylactic anticoagulation when compared to 56% rate of VTE in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation 7 . Our patient also had evidence of VTE early in the infectious disease process and was treated with a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH). One day after switching to therapeutic apixaban, he developed an arterial thrombotic event. D-Dimer was noted to remain mildly elevated despite therapeutic anticoagulation. While D-dimer elevation have been associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 6 , it is unknown if intensification of anticoagulant therapy based on D-Dimer thresholds alone improve patient outcomes 11 . Current guidelines do not recommend monitoring D-Dimer for the purpose of guiding anticoagulant therapy 11 , even so in our case it provided meaningful information.",

Patient's hospital stay was complicated with septic shock treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, dilated cardiomyopathy, acute renal injury and Candidaalbicans fungemia. Two weeks post-intubation on a surveillance check, D-Dimer value had increased to above 20 \u00b5g/ml FEU. This markedly elevated value and persistent fevers despite antimicrobials prompted venous duplex ultrasound that confirmed bilateral upper and lower extremities DVTs, and enoxaparin 150 mg (1mg/kg) twice daily was started. Two days after the therapeutic dose of enoxaparin was started, D-Dimer value had decreased, however remained mildly elevated at 4.98 \u00b5g/ml FEU. Three weeks later pending discharge, decision was made to transition to oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily. Thirty-seven hours after the last dose of enoxaparin and twenty-four hours after apixaban was started, the patient developed sudden-onset painless right eye vision loss. Immediate ophthalmological examination showed visual acuity of no light perception in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Anterior segment and motility examination were normal, and there was a right dense relative afferent pupillary defect. Dilated funduscopic examination showed mild optic disc edema, retinal whitening consistent with retinal edema, and mildly attenuated retinal vessels. No peripheral retinal hemorrhages or emboli were noted. 96 hours later, the funduscopic examination showed more diffuse retinal and optic disc edema, with an intact area of retinal perfusion in the infero-temporal peripapillary region, retinal exudates, severely attenuated retinal vessels, and absent macular cherry-red spot, confirming a diagnosis of incomplete OAO.
