Although there are almost 30 microorganisms that can be transmitted in this way, the most important are hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because they can lead to systemic infections and because of their current prevalence. The diversity of the clinical outcomes of these agents varies from asymptomatic infections to severe and even fatal infections.2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 The transmission of infections to health professionals via blood occurs mostly through penetration with needles used in patients, injury with contaminated sharp instruments, or mucosal splashes with infected blood or body fluids.19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Two thirds of health professionals have stated that they have been exposed to blood or body fluids at least once; HIV infection was related to the profession in 57% of HIV-positive health professionals, and the risk of developing hepatitis B infection in health professionals is 10 times greater than in the general population.17, 18, 28\n",

Violence, which has affected the health of health professionals recently, can be observed as a problem in every health institution and health professional.7, 40 Violence in a health institution is defined as a verbal or behavioral threat or physical or sexual assault.57, 58 It has been increasingly acknowledged that health professionals, who must be in direct contact with individuals in difficult situations because of their deteriorated health status, are the most frequent targets and victims of occupational violence among all professions.59, 60, 61, 62 In Turkey, 5 doctors have been killed in the last 10 years as a result of violence in hospitals: G\u00f6ksel Kalayci (November 11, 2005), Ali Menekse (January 15, 2008), Ersin Arslan (April 17, 2012), Melike Erdem (November 30, 2012), and Kamil Furtun (May 29, 2015).

This indicates that it is hard to overcome the risk of occupational disease and accidents. On the other hand, the gradual decrease in occupational accidents and job-related diseases in European countries in the last 10 years demonstrates the importance of applying precautions. In this regard, when we consider the outcomes of Turkey, we should support regulations in the workplace, create incentive systems, ensure the effectiveness of the Occupational Health and Safety Workers' Representation and Occupational Health and Security Committees, and increase training to foster social consciousness instead of waiting for employees and employers to apply these rules themselves.98 According to the International Labor Organization, it has been reported that there is $1.25 trillion loss each year as a result of OHS problems.101 In Turkey, the loss of only social security systems has been reported as approximately 4 million Turkish Liras per year.102 According to a report of Turkey Statistical Institute on 2007 gross domestic product values, the total costs of occupational accidents in Turkey are almost 35 billion Turkish Liras per year.103\n",

Therefore, the applications can vary from region to region and institution to institution as well as person to person.92 In this regard, it may be efficient in Turkey for the government to control services for health professionals and to see that these services are provided independent of the requests of individuals, as in various European countries.94 The health of health professionals also affects the health of the community. When we consider the regional differences of hospitals in terms of technical equipment, staff, and quality of services in Turkey, which is an emerging economy, it is very important to apply the regulations specified by national laws and procedures across the country, including the public and private health sectors. Additionally, it is crucial to decrease health workers' exposure to occupational risks.104\n",
