Brief occlusions were performed to assess end-inspiratory and end-expiratory airway and transpulmonary pressures (absolute and elastance ratio method) and to calculate respiratory and lung compliances as previously described [3, 4]. Dead space ventilation was assessed using two methods:\nThe Bohr equation using partial pressure of carbon dioxide in alveolar air (PACO2) and mixed expired air (PeCO2): (PACO2 \u2212 PeCO2)/PACO2. See our previous work for detailed description [5].The Enghoff modification of Bohr\u2019s equation using partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2): (PaCO2 \u2212 PeCO2)/PaCO2. Therefore, shunt and diffusion limitations are taken into the equation.",

Compliance of the respiratory system was low (42 \u00b1 3 mL/cmH2O) due to a lower than normal lung compliance (61 \u00b1 5 mL/cmH2O). However, compared to ARDS patients, lung compliance was relatively high, resulting in low end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressures (12 \u00b1 1 cmH2O). Chest wall compliance was slightly lower than normal due to prone positioning in most patients. COVID-19 patients had high dead space ventilation and gas exchange impairment (Bohr 52 \u00b1 3%; Enghoff modification 67 \u00b1 2%).\n",
