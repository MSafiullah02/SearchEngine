Since tumor cells are poor antigen-presenting cells, crosspresentation of tumor antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) is essential for the generation of tumor-specifi c cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses. A number of polymer-based nanomedicines have been developed to deliver genes into DCs, primarily by incorporating tumor-specifi c, antigen-encoding plasmid DNA with polycationic molecules to facilitate DNA loading and intracellular traffi cking. Direct in vivo targeting of plasmid DNA to DC surface receptors can induce high transfection effi ciency and long-term gene expression, essential for antigen loading onto major histocompatibility complex molecules and stimulation of T-cell responses.

The high prevalence of the disease has made it the basis of a major research focus, with the disease being investigated in many contexts. Intensive research has yielded a large body of information that has served to uncover biological, biochemical and pathophysiological aspects of the disease, as well as their underlying mechanisms. Based on the information gathered by the efforts of numerous researchers, novel nanosized medicines (nanomedicines), that can be effectively localized to tumors and actively taken up by cancer cells have been developed, and are expected to replace traditional chemotherapy and possibly irradiation due to increased effi ciencies and attenuated adverse side-effects [ 2 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 67, "end": 72, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 775, "end": 780, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Unfortunately, recent years have seen only minor improvements in cancer morbidity and mortality rates , with the most commonly used cancer therapies still being conventional chemotherapy, despite their serious side-effects. This has encouraged researchers to seek answers in the fi eld of immunotherapy [ 3 ] . Whereas exogenous anti-cancer agents have failed to generate strong and effective responses against tumors and induce regression, the endogenous activity of the immune system was hoped to elicit specifi c anti-tumor immunity that would result in tumor regression and elimination. In particularly, dendritic cell (DC) vaccinations were expected to induce immunological memory that would enable recognition and destruction of residual tumor cells that evaded earlier treatment, thereby avoiding recurrence of the disease [ 4 ] . Previous studies employing mouse models indicated that the establishment of anti-tumor immunity required the presentation of tumorassociated antigens (TAA) by DCs [ 5 , 6 ] . Two unique properties make DCs the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs), namely their ability to present exogenous antigens on major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I molecules to prime CD8 + T-cells (i.e., cross-presentation), and their capability to initiate, activate and modulate the various arms of the immune system in a coordinated manner. Indeed, in vivo targeting of tumor antigens into DCs was shown to elicit strong TAAspecifi c DC4 + and CD8 + immune responses [ 7 ] . Therefore, DCs loaded with TAA or tumor antigen-encoding plasmid DNA may facilitate the development of new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. This chapter highlights the repertoire of non-viral, nanosized polymeric DNA delivery systems (polyplexes) available to achieve effi cient gene transfer into DCs for immunotherapeutic applications in cancer therapy.

Immunotherapy includes the investigation of different mechanisms leading to activation of the immune response, and the development of methods to control such responses in a desired manner so as to combat disease, either as a single strategy or in combination with other treatments. In the specifi c case of cancer immunotherapy, it is speculated that the in vivo activity of endogenous immune cells would be far more sensitive and specifi c than would any exogenous treatment [ 8 ] . Anti-cancer vaccines have, thus been designed to induce both tumorspecifi c effector T cells and tumor-specifi c memory T-cells [ 4 ] . Such anti-cancer vaccination, it is hoped, will induce regression of established tumors, as well as prevent the onset of secondary tumors and metastases, possibly by addressing the issue of minimal residual disease (MRD). In this case, sparse cancerous cells that evaded irradiation or chemotherapy will be detected and destroyed by the immune system cells that, unlike the temporary exogenous treatment, are present in the body at all times. A major requirement for an effi cient anti-cancer vaccination is the generation of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, but manipulation of the other arms of the immune response, mainly CD4 + T helper cells, is critical for a robust and long lasting CTL response [ 9 -11 ] . CTL response generation depends on antigen (Ag) presentation on MHC t o na\u00efve DC8 + T cells.

Originally derived from bone marrow, DCs are seeded in all tissues, where they sample their environment in an attempt to detect tissue damage, pathogen entry, infl ammation and malignantly transformed cells by taking up particles and molecules, processing them into short peptides and presenting the resulting peptides on MHC molecules.

Mature DCs migrate to adjacent lymph nodes, where they present antigenic peptides to na\u00efve T-cells [ 4 ] . Ag presentation, co-stimulatory molecules expression, and the secretion of an appropriate set of cytokines and chemokines by DCs facilitate the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells into effector T-helper or T-cytotoxic cells, respectively [ 18 , 19 ] . DCs can, thus, simultaneously activate both a CTL response to directly kill pathogens or affected cells and a T-helper response to recruit and enhance the activity of other immune cells in the right context.

The MHC class I/peptide complexes are then exported along the constitutive secretory pathway to the cell membrane, where they are presented to na\u00efve CD8 + T-cells. The interaction between MHC class I/peptide complexes on DCs and T-cell receptors (TCR) on CD8 + T-cells induce the differentiation of na\u00efve CD8 + T-cells into cytotoxic T-cells that are capable of killing the infected or transformed cells ( Fig. 10 .1 ) [ 14 , 18 , 20 ] .

However, other kinds of threats can be addressed by the immune system APCs through the MHC class II pathway, but this pathway exclusively generates a T-helper response. As it is obvious that not every viral infection or malignant transformation involves APCs, and that many pathogens can impair antigen presentation by their host cells, an alternative mechanism must exist that would enable APCs to generate a cytotoxic T-cell response against the various exogenous threats they encounter [ 22 ] . Such a pathway indeed exists and is a unique property of DCs. In addition to the MHC class I and MHC class II antigen presentation pathways, DCs can present exogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules to CD8 + T-cells. This pathway is termed cross-presentation, implying that it involves mechanisms from both the MHC class I and the MHC class II pathways [ 23 ] . Although fi rst described more than three decades ago, the details of this pathway remain only poorly understood, with two main theories attempting to explain the mechanisms leading to MHC class I loading of endocytosed exogenous antigens. The cytosolic track suggests that the antigen is translocated from the endosome into the cytosol, where it enters the cytosolic processing pathway. The endocytic track, on the other hand, suggest that MHC I molecules are recycled from the cell membrane to the endosome, where they are loaded with antigenic peptides processed by endosomal proteases [ 21 , 24 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 629, "end": 635, "text": "[ 22 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 993, "end": 999, "text": "[ 23 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1602, "text": "[ 21 , 24 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cross-Presentation"}, {"text": "As mentioned earlier, anti-cancer immunity requires the generation of a specifi c anti-tumor CTL response that, in turn, requires proper antigen presentation. As part of the many techniques tumor cells use to avoid or weaken the immune system, they can substantially reduce the expression of MHC class I/peptide complexes on their cell surface. Since tumor cells are, thus, poor Ag-presenting cells, cross-presentation of tumor antigens by DCs is essential for the generation of tumor-specifi c CTL responses [ 4 ] . In addition, given the unique ability of DCs to initiate and orchestrate the various arms of the immune system, including recruitment and activation of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, T-helper cells and B-cells, a strong and comprehensive anti-cancer immune response can hopefully be achieved by inducing such cells to present an appropriate tumor antigen [ 10 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 509, "end": 514, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 881, "end": 887, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Role of DCs in Anti-Tumor CTL-Response Generation"}, {"text": "DC immunization requires that an appropriate antigen be presented to DCs in a proper manner and in the right immune context so as to allow Ag uptake, processing and presentation on MHC molecules, parallel to DC maturation and T-cell priming. The fi rst method developed for DC immunization involved the use of whole tumor cells (WTC) or tumor cell lysates, either alone, mixed with an adjuvant, or genetically modifi ed to express an adjuvant. The major advantage of this method is that no Ag identifi cation is required, and multiple Ags are being delivered simultaneously. Nevertheless, all WTC vaccine methods showed limited efficiency in clinical trials, probably due to insuffi cient interaction between the tumor antigens and the DCs [ 25 ] . Pulsing DCs with antigenic proteins or peptides corresponds to another approach. Protein-pulsed DCs are capable of presenting Ags on both MHC class I and MHC class II molecules, with a long half-life of MHC class I presentation and no HLA restriction (i.e., no need for patient selection), but they require an appropriate processing of the protein by DCs, which may be diffi cult to achieve. Peptide-pulsed DCs, on the other hand, require no processing. Still, they show limited MHC class II presentation, a short half-life of MHC class I presentation, and a HLA restriction. Specifi c or total tumor mRNA can be processed and presented on both MHC class I and class II molecules. This, however, requires mRNA extraction from a tumor sample and is, thus, patient-specifi c [ 15 , 26 ] . Lately, the delivery of tumor Ag-encoding plasmid DNA has emerged as a promising method for DC immunization [ 19 , 27 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 740, "end": 746, "text": "[ 25 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1533, "text": "[ 15 , 26 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1655, "text": "[ 19 , 27 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DC Immunization"}, {"text": "DNA vaccines are DCs that were genetically modifi ed to express TAAs. DNA vaccines are advantageous for several reasons. They enable the presentation of multiple epitopes of full-length TAAs on MHC class I and class II molecules, and since processing occurs within the cell, they are not HLA-restricted. In addition, effi cient gene transfer allows for a continuous supply of peptides in the modifi ed DC [ 10 ] . Genetic modifi cation of DCs can be achieved either by ex vivo gene delivery methods, including use of a gene gun, electroporation, ultrasound and microinjection, or by in vivo approaches, including naked DNA delivery, and viral or synthetic vectors [ 8 , 27 ] . Ex vivo delivery offers many advantages. The extracted cells are cultured and undergo maturation under controlled conditions and in the absence of inhibitory signals provided by the tumor cells, such that maturation status can be determined before re-administration. Since transfection occurs in culture, high specifi city is achieved as only the selected cells are transfected. Nevertheless, ex vivo gene delivery carries substantial limitations. The process is laborious, costly and time-consuming [ 12 ] . Patients must undergo cytopheresis, followed by culturing and maturation of the acquired cells, steps that must be performed for each patient separately. Reproducibility is very low and different quality control methods are used. Thus, only a limited number of patients would be expected to benefi t from this approach. Hence, ex vivo gene delivery is not likely to become widely marketable. Moreover, transfected mature DCs can show poor distribution from the injection site and ex vivo maturation can impair DC traffi cking to lymph nodes, a critical requirement for cross-priming [ 28 , 29 ] . In contrast, in vivo gene delivery may be expected to become \"off the shelf\" therapy. As a single product suitable for all patients, in vivo gene delivery can be produced on a large scale with lower costs. Simple and uniform manufacturing and product control procedures will enable reproducibility and control over product quality. In addition, DCs can be targeted at different sites and in their natural environment, thereby not impairing their natural course of maturation and activation [ 25 , 29 ] .

Third, they must facilitate escape from the endosome, cytoplasm traffi cking, nuclear transport and DNA unpacking [ 30 ] . To date, the most effi cient gene delivery systems are viral vectors.

The main drawback of such vectors is their low transfection effi ciency, as compared to viral vectors. Yet, synthetic vectors are simple, safe, easy to manufacture on a large scale and can carry plasmids of unrestricted size. Moreover, they can be easily modifi ed to possess desirable properties, including targetability, serum stability, reactivity to external signals and an ability to stimulate an immune response.

PLL is a linear polypeptide presenting L -lysine residues in repeat units ( Fig. 10.3c ). This fi rst generation cationic polymer bears \u025b-amino groups that electrostatically bind the negatively charged nucleic acids, and interact with the negatively charged cell membrane. The large number of active functional amine groups allows for easy modifi cation with targeting ligands [ 34 ] . However, the transfection effi ciency of PLL is very low because it cannot mediate escape from the endosomal compartment and release into the cytosol. To overcome this barrier, PLL is usually used in combination with chloroquine, although use of this agent is limited due to its cytotoxicity [ 35 ] . Another disadvantage of PLL polyplexes is that transfection effi ciency is signifi cantly infl uenced by serum, probably due to the rapid binding to negativelycharged serum components [ 36 ] . Furthermore, in vivo applications of PLL polyplexes are complicated by a high level of cytotoxicity [ 37 ] and lack of in vivo stability [ 38 , 39 ] . Because of low transfection effi ciency, imidazole groups (pKa ~ 6.5) were introduced into PLL to improve buffer capacity, thereby, enhancing transfection effi ciency [ 40 ] . PLL with high imidazole content mediated high gene transfection effi ciency, with gene expression levels close to those of PEI (discussed below), and exhibited low cytotoxicity. The PEGylation of PLL can also improve its cytotoxicity profi le [ 36 ] . Finally, whereas it has been found that PLL/DNA complexes can be taken up by DCs, PLL/DNA did not alter DC phenotype through surface marker expression [ 41 ] . Complexation of plasmid DNA encoding for chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA) with PLL-coated polystyrene (PS) particles induced high levels of CD8+ T-cells as well as OVA-specifi c antibodies in C57BL/6 mice, and further inhibited tumor growth after challenge with OVA expressing tumor cells [ 42 ] . PLL-based microspheres displaying mannan or mannoside-modifi ed surfaces (for targeting the mannose receptor, discussed below) were readily phagocytosed by both DCs and macrophages, however neither surface-assembled mannan-nor mannoside-modifi ed microspheres could stimulate DC maturation [ 43 ] .

As such, only about two-thirds of the amino groups in branched PEI are protonable under physiological conditions. The transfection effi ciency of PEIs depends on the molecule weight, the PEI nitrogen/DNA phosphate charge ratio (N/P) and the cell type. As every third position on the polymer backbone is occupied by a protonable amino group (Fig.  10.3a ) , its cationic charge density is very high, allowing for condensation of the negatively charged DNA. Under physiological conditions, only about 20 % of the PEI nitrogen atoms are protonated, leaving the other 80 % to facilitate the important step of endosomal escape by the so-called \" proton sponge effect \" [ 30 , 45 , 46 ] .

One of the CLRs, the mannose receptor (MR, CD206), is the most widely used receptor for targeting DCs, using both mannose and mannan [ 59 ] . While several studies demonstrated that mannosylated-PEI conjugates are effective in gene delivery via MR [ 60 -62 ] , their transfection potential for primary human and mouse DC was found to be rather low [ 60 ] . This might be due to the low affi nity of carbohydrate ligands to their receptors, which is usually in the low millimolar range [ 63 ] , thus, limiting in vivo transfection effi ciency. The eight adjacent CRDs in MR may help to increase the binding affi nity and specifi city of polyplexes containing mannosylated glycans in a multivalent display [ 59 , 64 ] . We have recently described the design of multivalent mannosylated PEI/DNA complexes bearing mono-and trivalent mannose as a ligand for targeting MR-positive DCs [ 65 ] . Complexes bearing mono-and trivalent mannose (Man-PEG-b-PEI/DNA and Man 3 -PEG-b-PEI/DNA, respectively) were safe and demonstrated signifi cantly higher in vitro transfection effi ciency in DCs. The mannosylated complexes were injected into the tail base of C57/BL6 mice, and 24 h post-injection, the percentages of GFP positive cells in the entire cell population and in the CD11c + cells taken from the inguinal lymph nodes were measured. When examining the entire cells population extracted from the lymph node, only PEI/DNA complexes showed detectable GFP activity, but no signifi cant change was observed between the treatments (Fig. 10.4a ) . However, Man 3 -PEGb -PEI/DNA was signifi cantly more effi cient in transfecting CD11c+ DCs collected from inguinal lymph nodes, as compared to polyplexes prepared with PEG-b-PEI/DNA or PEI/DNA (Fig. 10.4b ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 242, "text": "[ 4 , 54 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 391, "end": 397, "text": "[ 55 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 405, "end": 411, "text": "[ 56 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 432, "end": 438, "text": "[ 57 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 543, "end": 549, "text": "[ 58 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 862, "end": 868, "text": "[ 59 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 977, "end": 987, "text": "[ 60 -62 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1077, "end": 1083, "text": "[ 60 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1220, "text": "[ 63 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1444, "text": "[ 59 , 64 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1614, "text": "[ 65 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2250, "end": 2263, "text": "(Fig. 10.4a )", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2460, "end": 2473, "text": "(Fig. 10.4b )", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Poly(ethylenimine)"}, {"text": "One challenge of targeting the MR, as holds true for all of the other abovementioned receptors, is that they are not exclusively expressed on DCs, and are also on several other cell types [ 57 ] .

Szoka et al. fi rstly investigated PAMAM cascade polymers as non-viral gene delivery vectors [ 81 ] . These polymers have an ammonia initiator core and amido-amine repeat units of different A. David and A. Golani-Armon generations (G2-G10). Their stepwise synthesis results in products that are uniform in terms of structure and size [ 82 ] and bear a well-defi ned number of primary and tertiary amines. The surface primary amines are protonated, resulting in an extremely positively charged surface that enables DNA binding in stable complexes, and interaction with the cell membrane. The tertiary amines in the interior of the polyplexes are protonable, endowing the dendrimers with pH buffering capacity that enables endosomal escape of the polyplexes following cellular uptake [ 83 ] . All these properties, in addition to their non-immunogenic nature, make PAMAM dendrimers an alternative to the highly effi cient and highly immunogenic viral vectors. However, a major drawback of PAMAM dendrimers is that low generation dendrimers (G5 or lower) show poor transfection effi ciencies, while dendrimers of high generation (G6 and higher) are effi cient transfection agents, yet possess serious cytotoxicity [ 82 ] . In addition, synthesis of high generation dendrimers is a high cost, labor-consuming process that last several days, making them less likely to be designed for large scale production [ 83 ] . Mannosylated G4-PAMAM dendrimers conjugated to OVA specifi cally targeted DCs and induced cross-presentation in vivo [ 84 ] . Moreover, pre-immunization with mannosylated PAMAM-OVA leads to delayed onset of B16-OVA melanoma development, slower kinetics of tumor growth and increased survival of OVAimmunized mice. G4-PAMAM dendrimers bearing DC-SIGN ligand in multivalent presentation also achieved effi cient DC targeting properties, however, did not affect DCs maturation [ 20 ] . It has been postulated that mannosylated dendrimers, as opposed to DC-SIGN-modifi ed dendrimers, may trigger not only DC-SIGN, but also other mannose-specifi c CLRs that contributes to DC maturation and activation. G5-PAMAM dendrimers conjugated to MHC class II-targeting peptide (PADRE ,  Table 10 .1 ) and surface-loaded DNA have been shown to effectively transfect murine and human APCs in vitro [ 85 ] .
