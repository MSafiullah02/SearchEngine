Characteristic of C-type lectins with the CRD containing an EPN (Glu-Pro-Asn) motif, the receptor recognizes glycans containing terminal nonreducing mannose (Man), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and fucose (Fuc) in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner [4] [5] [6] . There are lines of evidence which indicate that, through this basic specificity, DC-SIGN recognizes endogenous self, exogenous nonself or tumor-specific ligands, and mediates various functions in the immune system. In the first line of evidence, DC-SIGN was found to bind to immune cells in a carbohydrate-dependent manner. In fact, DC-SIGN was reported to recognize na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells through ICAM-3 in a Lewis X -dependent manner, resulting in the initiation of an adaptive immune response [2, 7] . DC-SIGN also mediates interactions between DCs and neutrophils through binding to Lewis X of Mac-1 expressed on neutrophils, and hence regulates DC maturation [8] . Second, DC-SIGN recognizes invading pathogens via pathogen-specific glycan structures, and acts as a scavenging receptor for them. These pathogens include viruses (HIV, Ebola and dengue), bacteria (Mycobacterium, Neisseria), fungi (Candida, Aspergillus) and parasitic protozoa (Leishmania, Schistosoma) [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . As a contrasting feature, DC-SIGN has also been reported to function as a target for HIV entry, thus facilitating its infection [9] . Third, DC-SIGN recognizes tumor-specific glycans.

However, no binding was observed to highly branched N-glycans (tri-, tetra-, and penta-antenna, 105-108, 204, 205) or to chitin-related oligosaccharides (906, 907). In fact, DC-SIGN gave the highest affinity to 102 ( app K d , 55 lm), where the GlcNAc residue is attached at the GnT-I position of the trimannosyl core structure. The binding affinity to 102 was similar to that to 014 (55 lm), which showed the highest affinity among the high-mannose-type N-glycans tested. By contrast, no detectable binding was observed for its positioning isomer, 101, containing the GlcNAc residue at the GnT-II position. Other oligosaccharide structures containing the terminal GlcNAc residue at the GnT-I position (202, 68 lm; 103, 104 lm; 304, 140 lm; 403, 156 lm; 203, 322 lm; 104, 492 lm) were also highaffinity ligands for DC-SIGN. Binding was abolished by galactosylation of the GlcNAc residue at the GnT-I position (302), indicating that the terminal GlcNAc residue at the GnT-I position is important for DC-SIGN binding. Addition of the GlcNAc residue at the GnT-II position (e.g. 102 versus 103) resulted in only a moderate inhibitory effect, while the addition of the bisecting GlcNAc at the GnT-III position greatly reduced the binding to approx. 20% (104). Addition of the GlcNAc residue at the GnT-IV position (105) abolished the binding of DC-SIGN, indicating that highly branched N-glycans are not ligands for DC-SIGN. No significant effect was observed for core fucosylation on DC-SIGN binding (e.g. 103 versus 202). These results indicate that the presence of the terminal GlcNAc residue at the GnT-I position is essential for DC-SIGN binding to agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quantitative analysis of glycan-binding specificities of DC-SIGN-related lectins by FAC"}, {"text": "Among agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans, DC-SIGNR-Fc binding was detected for only two structures: bi-antennary, agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans with the GlcNAc residues at both GnT-I and GnT-II positions, with (202, 944 lm) or without (103, 964 lm) core-fucosylation. Under the experimental conditions of this study, no binding was detected for 102, the best ligand for DC-SIGN. No detectable binding was observed for other mono-antennary, agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans (101, 201), highly branched agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans (105-108, 204, 205) or chito-oligosaccharides (906, 907). The binding affinities for agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans were significantly lower than those for high-mannose-type N-glycans (005-017, > 292 lm), unlike the case of DC-SIGN. Addition of Gal on either GlcNAc residue of 202 or 103 abolished the binding affinity (304, 306, 307, 403-405). Addition of the bisecting GlcNAc transferred by GnT-III (104, 203) also abolished the affinity. These results demonstrate that DC-SIGNR has broadly similar, but different, specificity from DC-SIGN towards agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans. LSECtin gave selective affinity for agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans, while no binding was observed for high-mannose-type N-glycans. Among agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans, LSECtin exhibited binding affinities to mono-and bi-antennary structures (103, 23 lm; 202, 28 lm; 304, 38 lm; 403, 48 lm; 102, 49 lm), but not to tri-, tetra-and pentaantennary forms (105-108, 204, 205), consistent with the results of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. Also, the presence of the terminal GlcNAc at the GnT-I position was essential for LSECtin binding, and addition of the GlcNAc residue transferred by GnT-IV abolished the binding affinity (105, 204). However, addition of the bisecting GlcNAc (104) abolished the binding in the case of LSECtin. The specificity of the DC-SIGNrelated lectins to agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans is summarized as follows: (a) the presence of a terminal GlcNAc at the GnT-I position is essential, (b) the presence of a GlcNAc residue at the GnT-IV position abrogates binding (and therefore highly branched agalactosylated complex-type N-glycans are not recognized), (c) there is little or no effect of core fucosylation and (d) there is a significant inhibitory effect of the addition of bisecting GlcNAc.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quantitative analysis of glycan-binding specificities of DC-SIGN-related lectins by FAC"}, {"text": "In order to investigate the binding of DC-SIGNrelated lectins not only to liberated agalactosylated glycans but also to agalactosylated glycoproteins, we performed glycoconjugate microarray analyses [34] .

Culture supernatants derived from parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used as controls. Binding signals were detected using an evanescent-field fluorescence-assisted scanner (relevant data only are shown in Fig. 4A and full data are shown in Fig. S3 ). DC-SIGN-Fc exhibited substantial binding to agalactosylated a1-acid glycoprotein (aAGP) and transferrin (TF). The binding of DC-SIGN-Fc to agalactosylated aAGP and TF is not a result of its specificity to Lewis-related glycans, because it showed no detectable affinity for their intact (sialylated) and galactosylated forms. These data support the above results, obtained by FAC, that DC-SIGN-Fc shows specificity to agalactosylated N-glycans. The binding of DC-SIGN-Fc was abolished in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, indicating that the binding occurs via the C-type CRD. Weak signals on intact, galactosylated and agalactosylated TF are caused by the nonspecific reactivity of anti-human IgG used as a secondary antibody (Fig. S3 ).

However, each lectin showed distinct affinities to a variety of agalactosylated N-glycans. We used C-type CRDs fused with the Fc region of IgG, because the standard procedure, in which lectins are covalently immobilized on N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose through primary amine groups [31] , gave insufficient interaction for the DC-SIGN-related lectins tested. By contrast, the present procedure, using Fc-chimera conjugates, yielded good results with sufficient availabilities of the immobilized ligands (i.e. 10-60%). However, there is still room for discussion about K d \u2044 K a values determined in this work, which were basically defined for the disulfide-linked homodimer of each C-type CRD fused with an IgG Fc portion. The DC-SIGN-related lectins are thought to form relatively large multimers at the cell surface [6, 30] . In addition, the K d values are highly dependent on the experimental conditions, including temperature (in this work, 25\u00b0C), flow rate (0.125 mLAEmin )1 ), lectin density (various) and lectinimmobilization method (Fc chimera). In this study, the lectin densities were considerably different from one another. Hence, the affinity was expressed as 'apparent K d \u2044 K a ' throughout this manuscript. Nevertheless, the major conclusion reached in this work was that DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR and LSECtin exhibited common binding affinity to mono-and \u2044 or bi-antennary agalactosylated N-glycans. Although affinity enhancement by multivalent lectin-carbohydrate interaction is well documented, it is assumed that a simple 1 : 1 interaction, rather than multiple interactions, occurs under the FAC conditions used, because the oligosaccharide concentrations used for the analysis were low (2.5-5 nm). Moreover, accumulated evidence from crystallography suggests that multiple lectin-oligosaccharide interactions, leading to affinity enhancement, does not seem to occur in the cases of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR and their counterpart glycan ligands (see below).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 534, "end": 538, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1073, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1077, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the crystallographic analysis of DC-SIGN with GlcNAc 2 Man 3 (PDB code, 1k9i) [38] , the trimannosyl core structure was found to form hydrogen bonds via Ca 2+ -coordination with Glu347 and Asn349 in an EPN motif, as well as via van der Waals contact with Phe313. The terminal b1-2GlcNAc residue on the a1-3Man branch also forms both a hydrogen bond with Asn349 and van der Waals contact with Val351. In the structure of DC-SIGNR (1k9j) [38] , Asn361 in the EPN motif and Ser363 (Val351 in DC-SIGN) makes hydrogen bonds with the terminal b1-2GlcNAc residue. These observations support the present result that b1-2GlcNAc at the GnT-I position is critical for recognition by DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (Fig. S5) . Crystallographic studies also revealed that the terminal b1-2GlcNAc residue of the a1-6Man branch forms hydrogen bonds and \u2044 or van der Waals contacts (Asn311 and Phe313 of DC-SIGN; Asn323 and Phe325 of DC-SIGNR). In the case of LSECtin, for which neither crystallographic analyses nor NMR studies have been reported, we used a modeling structure available from MODBASE published by Pieper et al. [39] (http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/ index.cgi). Comparison between LSECtin and DC-SIGN CRDs (1k9i) indicated that the terminal b1-2GlcNAc residue on the a1-3Man branch would interact with Trp259, in addition to Ca 2+ -coordinated hydrogen bonds to the a1-3Man residue (Fig. S5) . Trp259 of LSECtin corresponds to Val351 in DC-SIGN and to Ser363 in DC-SIGNR, indicating that Trp259 would be involved in the binding to the terminal b1-2GlcNAc residue. Phe313 in DC-SIGN and Phe325 in DC-SIGNR also correspond to Arg219 in LSECtin, which probably interacts with the b1-2Glc-NAc residue on the a1-6Man branch. In the present FAC analysis, highly branched agalactosylated N-glycans were not recognized by the DC-SIGN-related lectins, presumably for reasons of steric hindrance. Indeed, there is no structural space to accommodate the terminal b1-4GlcNAc residue on the a1-3Man branch according to their reported crystal and modeling structures. The DC-SIGN-related lectins are unlikely to accommodate O-glycans because of steric hindrance caused by the presence of an attached polypeptide.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 85, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 439, "end": 443, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1109, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 696, "end": 705, "text": "(Fig. S5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF12"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1397, "text": "(Fig. S5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF12"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In addition to agalactosylated N-glycans, mannosylated glycans are also ligands for DC-SIGN and IgG1 chain C-region P01857 1.0 \u00b7 10 5 36", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Recognition of agalactosylated N-glycans by DC-SIGN R.

A significant difference was also observed in the binding affinities of the ligands for Fuc-containing glycans. An earlier report by Appelmelk et al. [40] indicated that DC-SIGN showed strong recognition of a series of Lewis antigenimmobilized polyacrylamides (i.e. Lewis a \u2044 b \u2044 x \u2044 y ) when analyzed using an ELISA. Subsequently, Guo et al. [4] demonstrated different aspects of specificities between DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR CRDs using glycan microarray analyses, and further discussed their binding mechanisms based on crystallographic analyses with lacto-N-fucopentaose III. They found that the Lewis antigens were high-affinity ligands for DC-SIGN, but not for DC-SIGNR. In fact, DC-SIGN Val351 is involved in tight van der Waals contact with 2-OH of Fuc on Lewis x antigen in addition to recognition of 3and 4-OH in a Ca 2+ -dependent binding manner (PDB code, 1sl5), whereas DC-SIGNR Ser363 excludes the contact with 2-OH of Fuc (1sl6) [4] . van Liempt et al. [23] also supported different binding modes between DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, regarding Lewis a \u2044 x trisaccharides, using modeling and docking simulation combined with a mutagenesis study. Glycan-binding receptors expressed on animal cells play key roles in endogenous cellular-adhesion events [23] . One the well-characterized example of this is leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion mediated by selectins. Like selectins, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR may also function as adhesion receptors for endogenous cells, such as T cells [2] , endothelial cells [42] and neutrophils [8] . Herein, we provided evidence that DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR and LSECtin serve as cellular adhesion receptors for mammalian agalactosylated CHO cells (Lec8 cells).
