The results allow designing haematological and electrophoretic profiles typical of each group, most likely depending on the management and on the health status of the group rather than on the prevalence of FIP. In fact, many cats from the colonies with open management and frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases other than FIP had one or more haematological and/or electrophoretical changes consistent with FIP, compared with the reference ranges. In the case of non-specific clinical signs such as fever or neurological signs because of diseases other than FIP, these cats would be erroneously considered as affected by FIP and euthanasized. The use of internal ranges designed on the basis of repeated samplings from non-symptomatic cats allows avoiding these misinterpretations. Results from cats with symptoms consistent with FIP living in the same colonies were also compared with both the reference ranges and the internal ones: such a comparison demonstrated that the use of internal ranges rarely affected the possibility to correctly diagnose the disease in cats with symptoms suggestive of FIP.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "U.S.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) that arises by a mutation from the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Vennema et al., 1995) . When FCoV is present in a cattery, it is likely to infect 90-100% of the cats and all the cats are likely to be seropositive (Addie et al., 2000) . The poor specificity of serological tests often induces use of other clinico-pathological changes as diagnostic markers of FIP. Clinical findings are often non-specific, especially in dry forms, and the diagnosis of FIP needs to be supported by the presence of non-regenerative anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis, lymphopenia, hyperproteinaemia, increased total-, a 2 -and c-globulins (Pedersen, 1995) . Unfortunately, some of these changes can also appear in cats as a consequence of chronic inflammation, stress or crowding (Kristensen and Barsanti, 1977; Jain, 1993) : in the case of fever, neurological signs, hepatic or renal failure because of diseases other than FIP, cats with the above-mentioned laboratory alterations may be erroneously suspected to have FIP and isolated from the colony (Addie and Jarrett, 1995) or euthanasized.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 216, "text": "(Vennema et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 344, "end": 364, "text": "(Addie et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 752, "end": 768, "text": "(Pedersen, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 893, "end": 924, "text": "(Kristensen and Barsanti, 1977;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 925, "end": 936, "text": "Jain, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1190, "text": "(Addie and Jarrett, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this paper, the prevalence of haematological and electrophoretic changes in multicat environments was determined by a retrospective analysis of data obtained from blood samples collected during 1999 from cats without symptoms consistent with FIP living in catteries with different prevalence of FIP.

Rarely, values that were within the reference ranges fell out of the internal ones: this occurred in both cats with FIP (erythrocytes, PMNs and a 2 -globulins in cat no. 8, c-globulins in cat no. 45) and in cats not affected by FIP (cat no. 9: erythrocytes and a 2 -globulins; cat no.10: PMNs).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 12, "end": 19, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "Group B"}, {"text": "The results presented here confirm that laboratory changes consistent with the diagnosis of FIP (anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis, lymphopenia, increased total proteins, increased total-, a 2 -and c-globulins) can be detected also in cats without Table 2 ); \u00a7 values different from the internal range (see Table 2 ).

Moreover, the analysis of repeated samplings allowed detecting significant or evident differences over the time, most frequently associated with outbreaks of infectious diseases (rinoconjunctivitis, upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis). In these cases, the most evident changes were obviously detectable in symptomatic cats (e.g. anaemia in cat no. 26 after an episode of haemorragic diarrhoea, neutrophilic leucocytosis in cat nos. 21, 22 and 26, which had rhinoconjunctivitis). But also the non-symptomatic cats of the same cattery had altered parameters. As a consequence, mean values and internal ranges calculated using the lowest and the highest values observed at each sampling, as suggested by Lumdsen (2000) for small groups of animals, were strongly different not only among the catteries but also among the different samplings. In order to reduce the variability because of transient alterations, mean values and internal ranges have been calculated also based on the results recorded during the whole study period. Although this might not be considered statistically correct, it can be the best way to represent the real laboratory profile of cats living in small or medium catteries. The majority of breeding catteries, in fact, are composed by 5-30 animals and have \u00d4open\u00d5 or \u00d4mixed\u00d5 management, because of repeated participation in cat shows and frequent exchange of cats with other catteries. In this situation, it is quite impossible to use a wide statistical approach and to avoid mild to moderate outbreaks of infectious diseases that can induce transient fluctuations of laboratory parameters.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 249, "end": 256, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 308, "end": 315, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The comparison of mean values obtained in the whole study period allowed to detect that, with the exception of total protein concentration that was in all the catteries close to the highest limit of the reference range, as already reported for colony cats (Kristensen and Barsanti, 1977; Kaneko, 1997) , each cattery was characterized by a particular laboratory profile and, as a consequence, by the presence of cats with some parameter out of the reference range. The presence of these changes seems to depend on the characteristic of the cattery rather than on the prevalence of FIP. In fact, the most evident haematological and eletrophoretic changes were detected in catteries 3 and 4, which had a high prevalence of FIP, open management and a poor health condition, while they were rare in cattery 1, which also had a high prevalence of FIP but close management practices and few cases of infectious diseases. The high number of lymphocytes in cattery 6 may depend on the recent appearance of FIP, as lymphoid hyperplasia in cats living with FCoV shedders has been reported (Kipar et al., 1999) . These suggestions can be confirmed by the analysis of the number of cats per cattery that had, at least in one sampling, values different from the reference range: also in this case, the number of cats with laboratory changes was low in cattery 1 and high in catteries 3 and 4. The high number of cats with hyperproteinaemia in catteries 2 and 5 might depend on their high percentage of old cats, which are known to have high total protein concentration (Kaneko, 1997) . Moreover, all the cats from cattery 6 had increased a 2 -globulins and this might be further support to the hypothesis of a recent contact with the FCoV, as an increase of this electrophoretic fraction has been recorded just after experimental infection with the FCoV, most likely depending on the increase of acute phase proteins (Stoddart et al., 1988) . However, it must also be considered that it is very likely to find at least one change compared with a range, when seven parameters are considered for three time-samplings. For this reason, also the presence of multiple laboratory alterations, that has a high diagnostic value for FIP (Sparkes et al., 1991; Pedersen, 1995) , was evaluated. The type of change most frequently observed, however, was very variable among the catteries, most likely depending on the laboratory profile of each cattery. In fact, cats with simultaneous changes were mainly detected in catteries 3 and 4, with electrophoretic changes associated with lymphopenia in cattery 3 and neutrophilia in cattery 4.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 287, "text": "(Kristensen and Barsanti, 1977;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 288, "end": 301, "text": "Kaneko, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1099, "text": "(Kipar et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1570, "text": "(Kaneko, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1927, "text": "(Stoddart et al., 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2237, "text": "(Sparkes et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2253, "text": "Pedersen, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "All these changes were obviously absent when the results are compared with internal ranges.

Only in catteries 1, 3 and 4 were both cats with FIP and with other diseases sampled. However, sensitivity and specificity can be interpreted as the possibility to avoid false negative and false positive results, respectively. On this perspective, in some cats with FIP values out of the reference range fell into the internal ones, thus decreasing the sensitivity of these changes (hyperproteinaemia in cattery 1, lymphopenia in cattery 3, neutrophilic leucocytosis in cattery 4). In contrast, the number of cats without FIP with anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis and increased a 2 -globulins recorded in cattery 1 was higher compared with the internal ranges than compared with the reference ones.
