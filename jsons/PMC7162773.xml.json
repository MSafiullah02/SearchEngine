Several rapid and sensitive detection tests were developed by the China CDC.d)On January 16, 2020, the National Health Commission (NHC) issued the first of seven versions of the protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.e)On January 20, 2020, the NHC upgraded the management of the COVID-19 to the highest-level pertaining to Class A infectious diseases.f)On January 21, 2020, the NHC officially started to release daily disease information on the government website.g)On January 23, 2020, the Chinese government began to limit movement of people in and out of Wuhan and announced all public transportation, including city buses, subways, ferries, long-distance coaches, outbound channels at airports, and railway stations in Wuhan had been suspended or closed.h)On January 24, 2020, the local government planned two new quarantine hospitals with 1,000 and 1,600 beds to be constructed within 10 days. By March 8, 2020, 42,600 healthcare professionals from outside Hubei and 1,800 epidemiologic teams participated in battling COVID-19 in Hubei.14\ni)On January 27, 2020, the Chinese government announced the extension of the Lunar New Year holidays, and postponement of reopening of schools and factories.j)On January 29, 2020, all 31 provinces on the Chinese mainland had activated a Level-1 public health emergency response, the highest in the country to prevent further spread.k)On February 3, 2020, public facilities such as conference venues and sports stadiums were converted into makeshift hospitals to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter and social activity.15 As of March 10, 2020, more than 12,000 patients had recovered and all makeshift hospitals were temporarily closed.16\nl)On February 7, 2020, the Chinese government announced that all medical expenses of confirmed patients would be covered by health insurance and/or financial compensation.m)On February 8, 2020, the Chinese central and local governments began to take measures to ensure the orderly resumption of production by companies to provide material support for the control of the epidemic. These included offering free health checkups and arranging chartered buses, trains, and airplanes to send migrant workers back to resume work in other regions.\n",

            "text": "Quarantine and surveillance are still the most effective means of controlling the spread of infectious diseases. Some of the strategies and tactics are described below:a)Limit migration \u2013Wuhan city announced a citywide lock-down on January 23, 2020. Subsequently, the Chinese government banned all domestic travel, extended the Lunar New Year holidays and postponed reopening of schools and factories to reduce the nationwide migration of the population.b)Designated hospitals \u2013 In Wuhan, to consolidate patients, medical experts, resources and treatment, there were 45 COVID-19 designated hospitals, 6 for critical patients, and 39 for severe patients and/or patients >65 years old. All regional hospitals established standardized fever clinics to timely screen for fever and strengthen isolation management. Designated hospitals were increased as needed by conversion of public and non-public hospitals.c)Community isolation \u2013 Travelers from Wuhan and other epidemic areas were required to register at their destination along with their travel history using smartphones and to self-quarantine for two weeks to prevent community transmission. Only one family member could leave the house to purchase daily living supplies every two days.d)Maintaining adequate supply of essential items and revamping supply chains \u2013 Express delivery companies conducted \"non-contact delivery\" in communities. Shelves in stores were kept stocked by criminalizing price gouging and preventing hoarding. Opening green channels and coordinating transportation of supplies helped to ensure the safe delivery of key supplies. In the early stages of COVID-19 outbreak, there was a shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE), which was mitigated by using reserve supplies, acquiring donations, and production increases (Appendix 1 and Figure S1).e)Testing \u2013 Early testing provided the basis for tracking and isolation in Wuhan to identify persons who could potentially spread the disease. The number of tests performed in Wuhan is shown in Figure 2\n.f)Tracking \u2013 A major part of the success in controlling the spread of COVID-19 was rooted in the tracking strategy. All patients testing positive for COVID-19 were tracked and their contacts isolated. Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) were used to strengthen contact tracing and the management of priority populations.g)Temperature screening \u2013 Temperature screening checkpoints were established at supermarkets, residential area entrances and transportation hubs. Everyone was screened for temperature when entering public areas. Temperature screening is a cheap, easily implemented, and rapid method of screening large numbers of the population for possible COVID-19. Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. Persons who had traveled to Hubei or had close contact with COVID-19 patients in the past 14 days were required to undergo temperature checks.10\nh)Personal protection \u2013 All residents were required to wear medical surgical masks or N95 masks when accessing public places. The internet and media were leveraged to publicize the correct knowledge of protection and prevention of spread, such as using masks, daily disinfection, and washing hands correctly.i)Control cross-infection \u2013 Hospitals offered online consultants and medical services to reduce the frequency that patients visited hospitals. Online work and learning were used to avoid cross-infection.\n",

Lung protective ventilation strategy, i.e. low tidal volumes (6-8ml/kg of predicted body weight) and low inspiratory pressures (platform pressure < 30 cmH2O) should be incorporated to prevent ventilator-related lung injury.32\n",

This also means that discontinuing ACEI in patients with COVID-19 is not necessary. With regard to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), there is evidence that ARBs could lead to increased expression of ACE2, thus worsening disease, but this remains controversial. There is no current recommendation to discontinue ARBs in treatment of COVID-19 in China. Monteil et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 infection in engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids could be inhibited by human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2).83 Further investigations are required to shed light on the role of ACE2 in cardiac manifestations of COVID-19.",

In the early days of the epidemic, the genomic sequence of the virus was determined and tests kits that would deliver results within hours were developed. It should be emphasized that the lockdown in Wuhan was a complete lockdown, other than bringing in necessary medical personnel, ventilators and PPE, as well as everyday goods and supplies. The difference between this type of lockdown and the shelter in place recommendations that have been put forward in many Western countries is that the lockdown in Wuhan was strictly enforced. Laws in Wuhan limited grocery shopping to one person per household, once every 2 days, with identity checks when leaving and returning. This type of enforced lockdown was later extended to the rest of the country, so that even in cities of over 7 million and only 200 cases, the population experienced the same restrictions (Table 4). The entire country stayed on lockdown for over two months. When lockdown measures were eased over the past few weeks, temperature checks were still being performed and one had to show electronic medical data on one\u2019s electronic device. The lesson here is that if effective quarantine is what needs to occur, these measures must be supported by personnel to enforce them, and they cannot be voluntary or simply recommended.",
