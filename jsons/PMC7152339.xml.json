The most commonly used scoring system has been that of Westley et al.10 (Table 24.1\n), which evaluates the severity of croup by assessing five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis, stridor, air entry and retractions. This system has been extremely valuable in treatment trials but has little use in the routine clinical setting. However, the Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline Working Group has developed another clinically useful severity assessment table. Using this classification scheme, 85% of children in 21 general emergency departments in Alberta, Canada,11 were determined to have mild croup and less than 1% had severe croup. The assessment is as follows:\u2022mild croup: occasional barking cough, no audible rest stridor, and either mild or no suprasternal or intercostal retractions;\u2022moderate croup: frequent barking cough, easily audible rest stridor, and suprasternal and sternal retractions at rest, with little or no agitation;\u2022severe croup: frequent barking cough, prominent inspiratory and, occasionally, expiratory stridor, marked sternal retractions, agitation and distress; and\u2022impending respiratory failure: barking cough (often not prominent), audible rest stridor, sternal retractions may not be marked, lethargy or decreased vigilance, and often dusky appearance with no supplemental oxygen.\n",

In two other small trials, control subjects who received nebulized saline also had improvement in their croup scores over baseline values.10 Since none of these studies included an untreated control group, it is not possible to determine whether or not the improvements were due to the moist air.

The ulcers are usually stress related and last approximately 1 week. Very extensive aphthous ulceration can also be seen as a complication of HIV infection. Beh\u00e7et's syndrome may cause aphthous stomatitis. Kawasaki disease, most common in young children, can cause significant redness of the oral mucosa. Most children with Kawasaki disease also have fever, a strawberry tongue and, importantly, conjunctivitis. This condition is frequently confused with streptococcal disease. Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome can result in pharyngitis, stomatitis and perioral swelling and ulcerations. Marshall's syndrome or PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, cervical adenitis) syndrome is a pediatric periodic disease characterized by recurrent febrile episodes associated with head and neck symptoms.42\n",

Since toddlers with GABHS respiratory tract infection may not present with classic symptoms, the diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis among children should be based on laboratory tests in conjunction with the clinical findings. Culture isolation of GABHS from the pharynx is the gold standard, but 2 days are needed for it to be informative. On the other hand, the rapid antigen detection test (RADT) detects the presence of GABHS within a few minutes and has high sensitivity and specificity.",

In addition, it allows the practitioner to treat only those cases with GABHS, thus avoiding prescribing antibiotics for viral infections. Group B, C and G streptococci can also cause significant morbidity, but only group A leads to rheumatic fever, so the reason for treatment is not only to eliminate the pharyngitis but also to prevent the subsequent rheumatic disease. Viral causes of pharyngitis do not normally require specific diagnosis, but serologic tests are available for mononucleosis (EBV) and cytomegalovirus. Adenoviruses, RSV and parainfluenza viruses can be diagnosed using rapid antigen tests, which are available but rarely used in uncomplicated community-acquired infections.",

Viral causes of pharyngitis can be most suitably treated with supportive measures: gargles, lozenges, etc. Mycoplasma and Chlamydia spp. infections can be treated with erythromycin or tetracycline (depending on age). Diphtheria and Arcanobacterium spp. infections should be treated with erythromycin or penicillin. Legionella spp. infections should be treated with tetracycline.
