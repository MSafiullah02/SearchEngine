Purulent secretions and prevention of complications are two common justifications for antibiotic treatment of URI. The clinical finding of purulent sputum or rhinorrhea in a patient with URI symptoms is not a reliable indicator of bacterial infection and should not be used to justify treatment of the URI with antibiotics. Bacterial complication of a viral URI is rare, and antibiotics have not been shown to prevent complications such as pneumonia or hasten the resolution of URI in previously healthy adults. On the contrary, unnecessary antibiotic use predisposes patients to carriage of antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and to invasive infection with this bacterium in the future.",

Studies of rhinovirus infection describe duration of symptoms from 1 to 33 d, with an average illness lasting about 7-10 d. An estimated 0.2-2% of viral URIs are complicated by sinus ostia obstruction leading to bacterial infection. Although studies have shown that few patients with symptoms lasting less than 7 d will have bacterial infections, the small percentage of bacterial compared with viral sinus infections and the underestimation of the duration of viral symptoms suggest that the majority of illnesses lasting longer than 7 d are caused by viruses and will not benefit from antibiotic treatment.",

Just as the symptoms of viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis overlap, so do the radiographic changes they produce. Most patients with viral sinusitis will have abnormal sinus radiographs, and determination of the degree of mucosal thickening and sinus obstruction becomes a judgment call with predictive value similar to that of clinical findings alone.",

Therefore, rather than assigning treatment based on the difficult distinction of acute viral vs bacterial rhinosinusitis, antibiotic treatment should be prescribed for those patients with severe symptoms regardless of duration or patients with moderate symptoms that persist beyond 7 d. Patients who experience severe symptoms of purulent nasal discharge accompanied by maxillary tooth or facial pain, especially when unilateral, unilateral sinus tenderness, and worsening of symptoms after initial improvement should be treated with narrow-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in addition to the symptomatic treatments recommended for all patients with acute rhinosinusitis. Patients with mild symptoms or moderate symptoms persisting for less than 7 d should be treated with appropriate doses of analgesics, antipyretics, and decongestants and educated about their diagnosis and the chosen treatment strategy.",

These guidelines indicate that in certain areas there are high rates of resistance to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim present in S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, so that sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim would not be an ideal first choice.",

Previously undiagnosed asthma in a patient with acute cough is an important consideration, but it is difficult to distinguish asthma from transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness and abnormal spirometry associated with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Pneumonia is potentially the most serious diagnosis associated with acute cough illness and can be fairly accurately distinguished from acute bronchitis based on clinical examination findings.

A patient with cough for less than 3 wk, whose clinical examination is not suspicious for pneumonia may be considered to have acute bronchitis, which is likely because of infection with a respiratory virus. Chest radiography or other diagnostic tests are rarely warranted in a previously healthy adult in whom pneumonia has been excluded based on clinical presentation. Acute bronchitis is caused by both upper and lower respiratory tract viruses. Lower respiratory tract viruses such as influenza A and B, parainfluenza 3, and RSV are the most common causes of acute bronchitis, but upper tract viruses such as coronavirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus may also cause acute cough illness. Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae (strain TWAR) are the only nonviral causes of uncomplicated acute bronchitis in previously healthy adults, accounting for 5-10% of cases. Gram stain and culture of sputum does not reliably identify these agents and, therefore, it is not recommended for evaluation of acute bronchitis in adults without underlying lung disease.",

Because previously immunized adults often do not present with the characteristic whooping cough of pertussis, it is difficult to distinguish this disease in this patient population from other causes of acute bronchitis. It is recommended that antibiotic treatment for pertussis should be limited to those adults with a high probability of exposure to the disease, such as during documented outbreaks. Treatment is largely beneficial as it decreases shedding of the organism. As pertussis is rarely suspected prior to 7-10 d of illness it is too late to speed resolution of symptoms.",

However, judgment must also be used in weighing the high cost of the newer neuraminidase inhibitors, which are active against both influenza A and B, against their rather limited benefit of 1 d of less illness in addition to the requirement that they be taken within 48 h of symptom onset and may contribute to the emergence of resistant viral strains.",

Some patients with acute bronchitis will expect antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute bronchitis based on past experience. When antibiotic treatment is not warranted, all patients will benefit from the explanation that they have acute bronchitis, a self-limiting viral infection that may be thought of as a \"chest cold,\" and discussion about why antibiotics are not being prescribed. Patients should be prepared for the possibility that cough could last an average of 10-14 d. Analgesics, antipyretics, antitussives, \u03b2-agonist inhalers, and vaporizers should be offered, with the explanation that they will not shorten the course of illness but will provide symptomatic relief.",
