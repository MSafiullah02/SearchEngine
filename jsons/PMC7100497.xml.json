Influenza A viruses also infect a wide variety of animals, including swine, horses, and birds (both domestic and wild). The natural reservoir of influenza A viruses is thought to be aquatic birds.

            "text": "Aquatic birds are thought to be the primordial origin for all influenza A viruses. Influenza A is subtyped by identifying the HA and NA segments. Currently, 16 HA and 9 NA distinct segments have been found in avian influenza A viruses detected in wild birds and poultry. This could possibly create 144 HA/NA subtype combinations, but only 55 of these HA/NA subtype combinations were detected in a large survey of 36,809 samples from wild birds [1, 10, 11]. Recently, a new strain of influenza A virus was isolated from little yellow-shouldered bats captured in Guatemala which was significantly divergent from known influenza A viruses subtype. The HA of the bat virus was designated as H17 and the NA as N10, which increase the total number of HA and NA segments [12]. These different HA and NA types provide the potential for a virus bearing new HA or NA by genetic reassortment to emerge. These new subtypes have a greater likelihood of evading the hosts\u2019 immunity due to the naivety of the host immune system (antigenic shifts) and can cause pandemic episodes such as the 1918 event. In addition, the accumulation of mutations in two major antigenic glycoproteins, HA and NA, of influenza A viruses constantly creates new variant strains that elude the host immune response (antigenic drifts) and are the primary cause of the regular yearly influenza outbreak [1]. Interestingly, analysis of the evolution of influenza viruses found that the rate of mutation is host dependent with a much higher rate for viruses in mammalian hosts than in birds [13]. In addition to the basic understanding of the viruses (morphology, replication, genome composition, and organization), a myriad of studies in vaccine development, treatments and prevention controls, immune response, infection modeling, pathogenesis, transmission, and epidemiology have been published and extensively reviewed [14\u201326]. Despite extensive research and surveillance efforts, influenza viruses continue to outwit our efforts to control the disease by undergoing antigenic drifts or antigenic shifts that enable them to escape from preexisting immunity and continue to be a major cause of respiratory tract infection, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality each year.",

Consequently, the focus of many detection technologies has evolved toward accurate identification of subtype/strain and understanding of the evolution and molecular determinants of novel and pathogenic forms of influenza that can provide important information for prevention, containment, patient management, and control of influenza infection. Furthermore, the recent availability of potential anti-influenza treatments are only effective if rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for influenza epidemic management are available because the maximal efficacy of such treatment must be started within 36\u201348 h of onset of symptoms [27\u201329]. The requirements for optimal treatment also lead to the development of numerous rapid diagnostic tests for influenza viruses. This review discusses the progression of detection methodologies and specific gene targets of current and emerging technologies for detection and strain identification of influenza virus infection as well as their implications in patient management; that is, how they improve diagnosis, treatment, surveillance, and prevention of influenza infection.",

To date, cultivating influenza viruses in eggs remains the modality for vaccine production [1, 3, 30]. Subsequent to the first studies in eggs, tissue-culture systems using canine kidney cells [Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line] were also developed for virus isolation. Historically, laboratory diagnosis of influenza viruses was viewed as of limited value for disease management because of the long turnaround times of viral culture, limited test sensitivity, and lack of antiviral treatment options [31]. However, differential diagnosis of influenza infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone is insufficient to provide accurate diagnosis because similar clinical manifestations can also be caused by other respiratory tract viral pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses, etc.",

            "text": "Laboratory diagnosis of influenza viruses is based on two basic approaches: detection of the presence of the virus, or detection of a host immune response. In addition to viral culture, hemagglutinin inhibition assays (HAI), first described in 1942, were developed for the direct detection of the influenza virus. HAI is based on the principle that the HA on the virus surface can cause agglutination in the presence of erythrocytes. The HA subtype can be determined if agglutination is inhibited when the specimen is mixed with an antibody for a known HA subtype and red blood cells [32]. Besides being used to directly detect virus in a sample, an HAI assay can also be used to detect a host immune response depending on the format of the assay. Other approaches used that probe the host immune response to determine if an influenza virus infection has occurred are complement fixation assays (CF) and enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). CF assays, first developed in 1909 for syphilis diagnosis and then perfected in subsequent decades for general use in virology, use the properties of the innate immune system in which the complement in the serum interacts with antigen\u2013antibody complexes and does not interact with sensitized red blood cells, which remain unlysed [33]. CF assays will report more accurately for patients that have received an influenza vaccine and have developed antibodies against envelope proteins, which renders HAI tests unreliable for detecting influenza infection [34\u201336]. EIAs first developed in the 1960s are versatile and widely used methods for virus detection based on the interaction of antigen\u2013antibody, which has also been commonly applied for influenza detection. For this type of method, two or more antibodies (capture and detector antibodies) are used to interact with viral antigen and the detector antibody is labeled with enzyme or interacts with enzyme-labeled third antibodies that react with enzyme subtrate to produce colorimetric changes [35, 37, 38]. Although originally developed to probe the host immune response, this type of test has been developed for the direct detection of influenza virus.",

NANA converts to \u03b2-formylpyruvic acid by periodate oxidation, which then forms a pink chromophore when reacted with thiobarbituric acid. The presence of specific NA antibodies inhibits the occurrence of the reaction, and the specific NA type can be determined [39\u201341]. This method is rarely used since the development of the last group of detection methods (see below). While subtyping was initially developed to understand the distribution and composition of influenza strains, its current use is focused on monitoring and tracking high-risk strains such as H5N1 and H7N9 infections in domesticated birds and humans.",

Such information is needed to determine the genetic evolution of influenza viruses and guides decisions regarding treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and to formulate vaccines for the coming year [43]. Advances in viral culture techniques such as introducing new cell lines and shell-vial culture methods have improved the detection sensitivity and significantly decreased the turnaround time. The shell-vial culture method (turnaround time 1\u20133 days) is also versatile in detecting influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses causing similar symptoms, which increases the clinical utilities; thus, it is recommend by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a laboratory diagnosis procedure [43, 44].",

Even with the variation in detection sensitivity and their relatively extensive infrastructure requirements, the immunofluorescence staining methods have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting influenza virus and have been adapted for identification of specific influenza subtypes using monoclonal antibodies specific for HA subtypes, such as H1, H3, H5, and H7 [49\u201351].

            "text": "Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR are the most common NAATs used for influenza virus diagnosis. A simple search will turn up thousands of publications in PubMed on methods for detecting influenza virus using PCR-based methods. These methods can be used in any properly equipped research facility but depend on the individual laboratory obtaining the required reagents. While the sensitivity of all of these methods is usually very good, the specificity can vary widely depending on the specific sequence chosen as the target by the researchers. Because several different respiratory pathogens can cause symptoms similar to those of influenza, quite a few multiplex RT-PCR methods that target several gene targets at once have been developed for encompassing respiratory pathogens including influenza viruses. The coverage of the multiplex RT-PCR methods varies from only influenza viruses (different strains of influenza A and influenza B viruses or different type of influenza A viruses) to several different respiratory pathogens [60\u201366]. Real-time RT-PCR methods use fluorescence-labeled probes or fluorescent dyes to detect the PCR products without postamplification manipulation and added detection sensitivity, which further advances the utility of PCR-based methods for influenza detection. Indeed, the first commercially available kit for influenza was Hexaplex assay by Prodesse, Inc. (now Hologic Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, CA). The Hexaplex assay is multiplex RT-PCR with postamplification hybridization with product specific probes, which is quite time consuming. The assay was later replaced by Pro-Flu+, which is a real-time multiplex RT-PCR kit (Pro-Flu+ targets M gene of influenza A viruses, NS1 and NS2 genes of influenza B viruses) [67]. Most of these PCR-based assays use the NP and M genes for type-specific detection of influenza viruses because these are highly conserved, while genes encoding surface antigens HA and NA are targeted for subtyping influenza A viruses [58, 67]. NS gene is also used in some of the assays for type-specific detection [68\u201371]. RT-PCR, multiplex RT-PCR, and real-time RT-PCR represent important tools for the timely and sensitive diagnosis of influenza A virus infections with turnaround times of 1\u20134 h; however, these assays require laboratory set up, experienced personnel, and are not suitable for point-of-care diagnosis, which reduces their effectiveness in immediate clinical management.",

It uses T7 RNA polymerase, RNaseH, and reverse transcriptase with 5\u2032 primer containing the promoter sequence for bacteriophage T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and 3\u2032 primers specific for target DNA containing complementary sequence to detecting probes. The detecting probes can be labeled with either ruthenium-based electrochemiluminescent (ECL) tag, or biotin, or fluorescence. Depending on the probes used, the amplified products can be detected by electrochemiluminescence or ELISA, or fluorescence (real-time NASBA) [96, 107\u2013109]. The main gene target for influenza A detection is HA gene while PA gene is targeted for influenza B detection [108, 110\u2013117]. One multiplex NASBA was developed for influenza A and B, human parainfluenza virus 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial virus, rubella virus, and coxsackie virus, which uses M gene for influenza A and NS1 gene for influenza B detection [118]. Similar to RT-PCR, NASBA methods have high sensitivity, specificity, and similar turnaround time; however, these methods do not require thermocycling, have less stringent instrument requirements, and can be very useful for high-throughput application. In addition, real-time NASBA can be adapted and developed toward potential point-of-care assays for influenza detection that will have an impact on clinical management.",

The majority of the reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) methods are developed for avian, equine, and swine influenza detection, and relatively fewer assays for human influenza detection. For RT-LAMP methods, the HA gene is the main target for influenza A virus detection, and NP gene for influenza B virus detection [120\u2013142]. The major limitation of RT-LAMP is the complexity of primer design, making it generally not suitable for large-scale multiplex reaction.

There are several commercially available tests, and most of the assays target influenza viral nucleoprotein, which can detect as well as distinguish influenza A and B (Table 2 lists the characteristics of 25 rapid diagnostic kits). None of these tests provide subtype information on influenza A viruses and the sensitivities of these tests are approximately 50\u201370 % with 90\u201395 % specificity when compared to the gold standard of viral culturing [27, 54, 143, 144].

All the diagnostic methods mentioned have versions designed to test one or all of these targets. Methods that use antibodies as part of the identification process invariably have cross reactivity so that even if a new strain variant is present, there is still the possibility for detection. For subtyping, HA and NA segments are the targets because these define the subtypes of the viruses and identify highly pathogenic strains; that is, avian H5N1 and H7N9. Newer NAAT methods are much more specific in matching the target and even small changes in sequence can result in a test targeting HA or NA to fail. Consequently, more conserved gene segments have been included in the range of genes targeted. A typical target is the matrix gene segment. Tests for this segment typically report only the presence of type and no subtype information is provided. It is possible to couple tests for this target with tests for the HA and NA, producing a test that will detect influenza with high confidence and will subtype if the strain is of a known type.",

These antiviral drugs are most effective if given early in the infection. Similar to antibiotics resistance that develops in bacterial pathogens, the use of these antiviral drugs has already revealed/induced the existence of resistant strains. For neuraminidase inhibitor, drug-resistance mutations developed to affect NA catalytic sites, which consisted of 8 functional residues (R-118, D-151, R-152, R-224, E-276, R-292, R-371, and Y-406) and surrounded by 11 framework residues (E-119, R-156, W-178, S-179, D-198, I-222, E-227, H-274, E-277, N-294, and E-425) (N2 numbering system). These residues are conserved in all influenza A and B viruses. Several mutations of the catalytic sites and surrounding framework were identified to be associated with reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitor; however, only H274Y (H275Y in N1 numbering) is unequivocally considered oseltamivir resistant, while I222R, I222K (I223R and I223K in N1 numbering) are associated with zanamivir resistance [186, 187]. For M2 inhibitor, drug resistance is associated with mutations that cause amino acid substitutions of residues 26\u201334 in the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein, and the predominant mutation that confers M2 inhibitor resistance is S31N [187]. Consequently, the segments that indicate antiviral resistance, the NA and M2 genes, have also become important gene targets as well for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based assays, such as sequencing (Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing) and real-time RT-PCR allelic discrimination, to screen drug-resistance mutations.",

Consequently, fewer studies provide information regarding the prevalence of active influenza C virus infection in the general population and few detection assays of influenza C viruses are available. While any of the assays already mentioned for influenza A detection could be applied for the detection of influenza C, cell culture and RT-PCR are the most common assays used for influenza C virus isolation and characterization [188\u2013190].

In this context, these methods do not really have any serious limitations. They only suffer serious limitations if they are applied for purposes other than what they were designed for, such as determining individual patient care. These methods suffer from their cost and/or long turnaround time not justifying the information provided in a clinical setting. For this very reason, rapid diagnostic tests were developed. While these tests are fast and simple, they suffer from a lack of sensitivity so that a positive result can be trusted as accurate but a negative result cannot be used to rule out influenza infection. The other issue for these tests is more a reflection of the context in which people are infected by influenza. While influenza is the major cause of respiratory illness for a portion of each year, there remain several other potential causes that all exhibit similar early symptoms, which is when intervention might be more effective. Consequently, rapid testing in clinical settings is normally applied only when more serious symptoms have already developed. This is because any test that only reports on one of these pathogens does not provide a great deal of aid to treatment practice when a patient only has early symptoms. Information about all possible causes of the early symptoms needs to be provided in the same test before the potential benefits of such tests will make sense in clinical treatment situations.",

New technologies that allow the rapid detection of multiple pathogens from multiple markers in a single test will improve diagnostics for a large panel of respiratory pathogens that includes influenza viruses and better direct use of antivirals or antibiotics. Consequently, the gene targets used for detecting influenza viruses in future diagnostic tests are likely to broaden to include targets for typing, subtyping, and antiviral resistance identification in the same test. A key to advancing these tests to routine use in a clinical laboratory would be increased automation of steps within the various approaches. Even with an improved detection test that could be used in clinical settings, the question of whether clinical treatment procedures will actually change is not a foregone conclusion. The therapeutic management options are limited to a few antiviral treatments that need to be immediately administered and already there are indications of strains being resistant to these drugs.",

Until there is a significant change in the NGS technologies, it is unlikely that these methods will find use in the established clinical and surveillance settings. The more promising application of this technology is for new research to lead to a better characterization of rapidly evolving viral quasi-species and understanding of the evolution of the virus within a host. This has been an area of ongoing research with an excellent review on progress up to 2007 [192]. The data accessible from NGS systems has resulted in more recent research focusing on taking advantage of the new information that is available on the phylodynamics to give insight into the generation of new influenza strains.
