The HEV genome contains three partially overlapping reading frames (ORFs) (Emerson et al., 2004). The ORF1 codes for a large polyprotein containing several functional domains responsible for viral replication. These include, from the amino to carboxyl terminus, the viral methyltransferase (Mt, pfam 01660), the Y domain, the papain-like cysteine protease C41 (Plp, pfam 05417), a region of unknown function (Unk), the polyproline region (Pp, pfam 12526) (Purdy et al., 2012b), the Appr-1\u201d-p processing enzyme/macro domain (Md, pfam 01661) (Han et al., 2011), the UvrD/REP helicase (Hel, pfam 01443) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol, pfam 00978). ORF2 codes for the viral capsid, and ORF3 for a regulatory protein (Ahmad et al., 2011).",

            "text": "HEV causes epidemic and sporadic hepatitis in humans, for which there are no specific therapeutic options. Usually, hepatitis E is a self-limiting disease similar to hepatitis A (Khuroo, 2011). HEV was originally assumed to be transmitted only through a fecal-oral route of transmission, as humans were the only recognized host for the virus (Khuroo, 2011, Viswanathan, 1957, Zhuang et al., 1991). Initially, two genotypes, 1 and 2 (HEV1 and HEV2), of human HEV were identified. It was not until 1997 that a new genotype was isolated. This genotype, 3 (HEV3), infects humans and swine (Meng et al., 1997). Two years later, a fourth genotype (HEV4) was identified (Wang et al., 1999). Unlike HEV1 and HEV2, these new genotypes were more permissive with respect to their host range. The expanded host range included deer, wild boar and mongoose (Meng, 2011). Additional research showed that these new animal genotypes could be transmitted to humans zoonotically (Meng, 2011, Tei et al., 2003). More recently, two or three additional putative genotypes have been isolated: from rabbits (Zhao et al., 2009) and wild boar (Smith et al., 2013, Takahashi et al., 2011), although there is controversy about the exact classification of these viruses. A serosurvey of humans and swine in Bolivia showed that HEV3 may be transmitted from humans to humans (Purdy et al., 2012a) and evidence from changing epidemiological patterns for HEV in China suggests human-to-human transmission of HEV4 (Krawczynski et al., 2000).",

One remarkable example of the threat to public health posed by such viruses is the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2003 outbreak in Asia (Tsang et al., 2003). Zoonotic strains of HEV have the potential to cause serious disease and mortality (Aggarwal, 2011, Mizuo et al., 2005, Patra et al., 2007) in infected patients or change into phenotypes that may become more transmissible among humans (Krawczynski et al., 2000, Purdy et al., 2012a).

Epistasis plays a crucial role in viral evolution (Bonhoeffer et al., 2004, Sanjuan et al., 2004). Epistatic interactions among sites along the viral genome are widespread (Campo et al., 2008, Donlin et al., 2012) and frequently observed in the form of coordinated (Campo et al., 2008) and compensatory substitutions (Khudyakov, 2010, Yi et al., 2007). The pervasive nature of coevolution and its association with adaptation suggest the use of coevolving genomic sites as genetic markers of important viral phenotypic traits such as drug resistance (Lara and Khudyakov, 2012, Lara et al., 2011b) and virulence (Khudyakov, 2012). Coordinated substitutions among genomic sites were shown to be associated with response to combined interferon and ribavirin therapy among hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients (Aurora et al., 2009, Lara et al., 2011b) and resistance to lamivudine among hepatitis B virus infected patients (Thai et al., 2012). Host factors such as gender, ethnicity and age have also been linked to coordination among HCV genomic substitutions (Lara et al., 2011a), suggesting host specificity of viral evolution.",

This study evaluated host-specific coevolution among protein sites in HEV3 and HEV4. For this purpose, a BN approach was used to: (i) model epistatic connectivity among amino acid (aa) sites from proteins of HEV3 and HEV4 strains identified in swine and humans; (ii) examine the strength of association between the aa substitutions and host origin, and (iii) identify genetic markers of HEV host specificity.",

However, no ancestral associations with host specificity were found among the HEV3 or HEV4 strains despite many attempts to identify a phylogenetic linkage of individual strains to the host origin (Bouquet et al., 2012a, Purdy et al., 2012b, Smith et al., 2012). Although the host-specific distribution of HEV3 subtypes was observed in a small rural community in southeastern Bolivia, it was most probably caused by the high prevalence of the infection rather than adaptation of different viral lineages to swine or humans (Purdy et al., 2012a). Complex patterns of HEV transmission among hosts of different species generate conditions for maintenance of significant heterogeneity among HEV strain, which cannot be adequately represented in short genomic regions usually used for phylogenetic inference (Purdy et al., 2012a). However, the ineffective representation of genealogical relationships with short genomic regions cannot explain elusiveness of ancestral connections to the host origin of HEV strains since analysis of the HEV whole-genome sequences is also unsuccessful in detecting the host-specific clustering of HEV3 or HEV4 lineages derived from different host species (Bouquet et al., 2012a, Purdy et al., 2012b).",

Several measures for examining the phylogenetic relatedness of phenotypic characteristics have been developed over the past 20 years. Parker et al. (2008) created a software platform, Befi-BaTS, that calculates seven of these metrics to analyze the degree to which phenotypic characteristics are correlated with shared ancestry. Befi-Bats was used to analyze the relatedness of host specificity to HEV ORF1 PSTs for HEV3 and HEV4. Befi-BaTS uses a Bayesian PST to estimate the significance of the taxon-phenotypic character associations. Table S1 (Supplementary Material) shows that only some of these metrics were significant. Those metrics, which examine all traits together across the PST under investigation, tended to be statistically significant, while the monophyletic clade size, which examines each trait individually, were statistically insignificant. More test metrics were not statistically significant for the HEV4 PST as compared to HEV3 (Table S1). This lack of agreement among all methods is difficult to interpret as there is no definitive guide for comparing these metrics. The distribution of sequences from the swine host appears to be random in the PSTs from both genotypes. As noted by Gittleman and Luh (1992), \u201cif phylogentic correlation is not observed, then comparative method procedures should not be adopted.\u201d For this reason we chose to use Bayesian networks to elucidate the relationship between host specificity and genome sequence.",

This observation implies host-specific coevolution among HEV protein sites. Although only a single site is linked to the host variable in both BNs (Fig. 1), host association is not encoded at any single protein position. Rather, many sites contribute to the host-specific epistatic connectivity. This inference is supported by the observation that not a single site had a strong MI with the host origin (Fig. 5). The host association of any aa site should be considered in conjunction with many other sites in BNs (Fig. 5). Sites, collectively affecting the distribution of the host probability (Fig.1), were identified for each HEV3 and HEV4 protein (Table 1), indicating association between genetic heterogeneity of these groups of sites with host specificity. However, this association was most measurable for the ORF1-encoded protein of both genotypes (Table 1, Table 4), with the ORF2- and ORF3-encoded proteins containing only small groups of sites producing a smaller effect on the host variable in BNs (Table 1).",

Accordingly, domain Pp was found to contain many ligand binding sites, supporting its potential regulatory functions. These findings in conjunction with the extensive homoplasy of the Pp sites identified along the major HEV3 and HEV4 phylogenetic lineages suggest a role for Pp in the intra-host adaptation (Purdy et al., 2012b) and, taken together with observations made in this study, strongly support the prominent role of this domain in adaptation to the broad host range of these 2 HEV genotypes.",

Identification of the phylogenetic connection to host would indicate heritable reduction in the host range for individual strains, similar to that observed in HEV1 and HEV2. For HEV3 and HEV4 lineages, convergence implies a certain genetic plasticity of host adaptation. Host specificity seems to be an abundant phenotype, which can be established by many HEV3 and HEV4 genetic variants. The BN models indicated coevolution among \u223c70% of all polymorphic aa sites (Fig. 1), suggesting involvement of the entire HEV genome in host adaptation. However, each HEV protein and ORF1 domain had a strong independent association with the host. Identification of the various groups of aa sites associated with host origin (Fig. 6; Table 1, Table 4, Table 5) indicates that HEV may efficiently achieve this adaptation via many genetic pathways, each requiring small but specific genetic adjustments rather than global genetic changes across the entire genome. The lack of a clear phylogenetic separation among HEV3 and HEV4 lineages by hosts (Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material) further suggests that each HEV strain achieves adaptation to the host using different small subsets of coevolving aa sites rather than hardwiring host specificity into a small number of invariant aa sites. The presence of certain minimal genetic changes seems to be sufficient for establishing effective infection in a different host and renders all other genetic changes across the genome, though also associated with host specificity, redundant.",

We hypothesize that there are various ways for achieving host adaptation, each requiring a few genetic changes. These changes may be generated rapidly during HEV infection (Bouquet et al., 2012b). Accumulation of substitutions leads to diverse intra-host HEV population in swine and humans (Bouquet et al., 2012b, Grandadam et al., 2004). Thus, host-specific substitutions may preexist among intra-host variants in the previous host (Borucki et al., 2013). Taking into consideration the zoonotic nature of HEV3 and HEV4, it is conceivable that the swine intra-host HEV variants have a much greater range of replication rates when introduced to humans, with only a fraction of the swine variants capable of replicating efficiently in human hosts.",

Indeed, a lower variability among human than swine intra-host HEV variants was recently reported after the experimental transmission of a single human HEV strain to swine (Bouquet et al., 2012b), suggesting differences in selection pressures acting on HEV in different hosts that result in variation in genetic heterogeneity. Thus, the HEV variants replicating efficiently in humans may represent a subset of swine variants. The previously reported dose dependence of establishing HEV infection and clinical manifestation of the infection (Aggarwal et al., 2001, Takahashi et al., 2012) is consistent with this hypothesis, which further implies that HEV transmission from swine should be most effective when achieved in bulk. Such transmission is frequently associated with consumption of raw or under-cooked meat from infected animals (Lewis et al., 2010, Li et al., 2005, Tei et al., 2003, Teo, 2010). In these cases, exposure to the large HEV quantity is expected while low-dose transmission would lead to subclinical infection and explain the high rates of seroprevalence seen in many industrialized countries (Purdy and Khudyakov, 2011).",

HEV4 strains employ a greater number of aa sites than HEV3 (n\n = 97 for HEV4 vs. n\n = 60 for HEV3 in BNs shown in Fig. 6) for adaptation. There were \u223c2.5\u20133.0-times more aa sites, which were not shared by BNSwine and BNHuman, for HEV4 than for HEV3 (Fig. 6). These differences resulted in a very low correlation (r\n = 0.0313) between features of BNSwine and BNHuman for HEV4, whereas this correlation was r\n = 0.7004 for HEV3. Coordination of sites from the Pp domain was especially genotype-specific (Fig. 3). Although the HEV3 host motifs contained only 1 Pp site, there were 8 and 23 sites from this domain involved in the HEV4 BNSwine and BNHuman, respectively, with none of them shared by both BNs (Fig. 6). Thus, the data indicate that HEV4 has more complex genetic requirements for the efficient replication in different host species than HEV3, which is reflected in a more accurate performance of all models generated using HEV4 sequences (Table 4, Table 5, Fig. 7 and Table S2).",

The estimated low number of symptomatic HEV infections in China (Wedemeyer and Pischke, 2011), where HEV4 is endemic (Liu et al., 2012), suggests that HEV4 is less virulent and/or may only be transmitted infrequently in a dose sufficient for causing the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Additionally, the host specific separation between HEV genotypes has been reported in India, where HEV4 was found infecting animals while HEV1 infections were detected among humans (Arankalle et al., 2002, Shukla et al., 2007). Although the molecular and epidemiological mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not known (Purdy and Khudyakov, 2011), both observations are consistent with the suggested low infectivity of HEV4 to humans. However, once the specific genetic composition is acquired; e.g., through continuous passaging among humans, HEV4 should attain a greater capacity for establishing human infection and, as a result, become more virulent. We speculate that the increased detection of HEV4 infections in China observed over the last decade (Liu et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2011) is related to such adaptation of HEV4 to humans.",

Understanding of the extent of heritability of host specificity and genetic factors facilitating zoonotic transmission is important for the efficient control of emerging infectious diseases. Findings made in this study indicate that HEV is uniquely suitable for assessing these parameters of viral infections. The HEV capacity to infect humans is not uniformly distributed among HEV strains. It is strongly encoded in genetic composition of HEV1 and HEV2, whereas closely related strains of HEV3 and HEV4 vary in their capacity to establish infection in humans. Such breadth of genetic associations to host adaptation presents a valuable opportunity for exploring heritability of host specificity and understanding genetic mechanisms responsible for emerging viral diseases.",

Probability mapping of human and swine strains is color-coded, with human space shown in blue and swine in red. Color density is proportional to probability values. (A) LP map of HEV3 variants (n = 65) using Pol aa physicochemical properties or markers (n = 16); (B) LP map of HEV4 variants (n = 55) using Pol markers (n = 16) and (C) LP map of HEV4 variants (n = 55) using the Pp markers (n = 10). Below the mappings are line charts showing the prediction results (probability scores) on validation datasets from the above corresponding LP maps; y-axis represents probability [0\u20131]; p(H) and p(S) are probabilities of the human (blue line) and swine (red line) origin of a strain, respectively. GenBank accession numbers (x-axis) are shown for each test sequence; black triangles and circles identify HEV strains obtained from humans and swine, respectively.
