In this paper, we set out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2/host receptor recognition, a crucial factor for successful virus infection. Based on the current knowledge of the interactome between SARS-CoV-2 and host cell proteins, we performed Master Regulator Analysis to detect which parts of the human interactome are most affected by the infection. We detected, amongst others, affected apoptotic and mitochondrial mechanisms, and a downregulation of the ACE2 protein receptor, notions that can be used to develop specific therapies against this new virus.",

            "text": "Beta-coronaviruses are a subgroup of the coronavirus family, large enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses able to infect a wide variety of mammals and avian species, causing mainly respiratory or enteric diseases [1] . They present surface spikes formed by (S) glycoproteins which mediate binding to susceptible host cell receptors to initiate the infection [2] . To date, seven betacoronaviruses are known to cause human disease. The prevalent strains (HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43) typically cause mild infections of the upper respiratory tract in humans [3] , while three strains were found to pose a severe health threat, leading in some cases to a fatal outcome: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 [4] . SARS-CoV was recognized as the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak occurring in China in 2002 and 2003 [5] , while MERS-CoV was responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome occurring in 2012 [6] . In both cases, the infected patients manifested severe acute pneumonia, but while SARS-CoV infected mainly the lower respiratory tract, MERS-CoV caused more pronounced gastrointestinal symptoms, often associated with kidney failure [7] . This can be possibly explained by a difference in recognition of host surface receptors. While the primary human receptor for SARS S glycoprotein is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely expressed on the surface of the cells in the lower respiratory tract, MERS-CoV preferentially binds to surface enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26), which is present both in the lower respiratory tract as well as kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract [8] [9] [10] . This distribution may also explain the observed difference in transmission of the two viruses [7] . The third highly pathogenic strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, appeared in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [11] . It is a highly aggressive new coronavirus which has infected more than 83,000 people (at February 29) , with an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% [12] . In less than two months, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak spread from the Hubei Province to 26 other countries, reaching also the US and Europe, being Italy the European country with the highest number of patients tested positive for the new coronavirus [13] . Given the emergency, the characterization of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and features of virus-host interactions is demanding to identify candidate molecules to inhibit viral functions. Sequence similarity of new coronavirus with SARS and MERS was previously reported and close similarities with wild bat coronaviruses has been reported [14] . New coronavirus spike S glycoprotein sequence shares a sequence identity above 72% with human SARS, showing a unique furin-like cleavage site which is a feature absent in the other SARS-like CoVs [15] . Biophysical and structural evidence that new SARS-CoV-2 may bind ACE2 receptor with higher affinity than SARS-CoV has been recently reported [9] . The wide distribution and similarity of this receptor in the animal kingdom may account for cross-species transmission [16] , while the pattern of expression of ACE2 in human respiratory epithelia and oral mucosa may explain the fast humanhuman transmission [17] . Despite the crucial need for a clinical strategy to counteract this epidemiological outbreak, no specific drug has been identified yet. This will require the elucidation of genetic features, molecular constituents and mechanisms of infection, which ultimately reside in the mechanisms regulating virus-host interaction and host responses. However, there is a lack of molecular data describing the COVID-19, and those available are related to the genomic and protein sequence of this virus [14] and there is currently no high-throughput dataset describing the mechanism of infection, e.g. transcriptomics of infected lung cells. In this context, the use of bioinformatics approaches may help filling the gap of missing data and improve the process of knowledge discovery by elucidating molecular mechanisms behind virus replication, the process of viral attachment to the host cells and the effect on the host molecular pathways [18] . The final understanding of the molecular action of the virus may improve or accelerate the development of anti-viral therapeutic approaches using information and data available for other coronaviruses [19] . Here, we applied a network approach to investigate cellular responses to the interaction of human cells with SARS and MERS viruses to get more insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating susceptibility to infection and transmission. The analysis of cell-context specific repertoires of molecular interactions, or interactomes, are becoming increasingly useful to dissect molecular pathways and biological processes, because they offer the possibility to get a comprehensive overview of cellular regulatory programs [20] . Integration of interactome maps to gene-regulatory networks (i.e. topological maps representing relationships between transcription factors and their target genes), can better provide insights into critical cellular elements that regulate a certain phenotypic state or response [21] . It has been observed that a number of large-scale transcriptional cascades behind complex cellular processes can be explained by the action of a relatively small number of transcription factors, or Master Regulators [22] [23] [24] . The identification of most crucial factors governing a determined phenotypic state is known as Master Regulator Analysis (MRA) [25] . In this study, we set out to apply an integrated network approach combining protein interactions and transcriptional networks to identify Master Regulators of coronavirus infections in human airway cells, in the hope of shedding more light on the virus/host interaction mechanism and also on the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "We obtained the most up-to-date specific SARS-CoV-2/human interactome from [26] . This network, which we represent in Figure 1 , highlights the complex interaction between the 31 viral proteins (coded by a surprisingly compact genome of only 30kb) and 94 human proteins, ranging from surface reenzymes (ACE2) to RNA-processing proteins (DDX5) to mitochondrial constituents (BCL2). In order to understand how this interactome is functionally affected by the viral infection, we obtained transcriptome wide microarray data depicting gene expression changes upon MERS-CoV [35] and SARS-CoV [32] on human bronchial-derived 2B4 cells. We therefore performed Master Regulator Analysis (MRA) [22] using a context-specific network model derived from the largest available human Lung RNA-Seq dataset from GTEX [28] . This allowed us to have a robust readout not only of the changes of the transcript of each protein-encoding human gene in the interactome, but also of its proximal functional network [30] . Since transcriptomics data of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet available, we reasoned that combining the SARS-CoV-2 specific interactome with transcriptome-wide datasets from two viruses belonging to the same family would provide a robust readout of the human cell response to this new virus. The combined results of both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection are depicted in Figure 1 using Stouffer integration of the Normalized Enrichment Scores (NES) of both analyses. Individual MRAs of beta-coronavirus infections are available in Figure 2 for MERS-CoV analysis (panel A) and SARS-CoV analysis (panel B) for the 8 protein networks with the highest integrated NES. Figure 3 shows the compared MRAs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and we decided to focus on the 8 proteins that share the highest response similarity in both experiments, as they are more likely to be conserved host responses to beta-coronavirus infection. Full results for all human interactome proteins are available in Supplementary File S2, for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and both integrated by Stouffer integration. Our MRA results show a strong, shared upregulation of MCL1, a positive regulator of apoptosis [48] . Apoptosis is a complex molecular cascade usually activated to eliminate unwanted cells in a living organism, for example during development, and it can be self-initiated or induced by immune system cells [49] . Also during virus attacks, induced cell death is a known mechanism to get rid of infected cells: specifically, the activation of MCL1 in coronavirus infection has been observed as an early host cell mechanism of antiviral defense [50] . It is therefore likely that the host cell is able to sense the virus, perhaps even by the direct interaction between MCL1 and the viral ORF7a (Figure 1) , to start the apoptotic cascade and shut down both itself and the replicating viruses. However, apoptosis has been reported to help the spreading of the virus by increasing replication rates and virion release from the dying cell in avian coronaviruses [51] . We also report several concordantly human proteins down-regulated by beta-coronavirus infections. One of these is EEF1A1 (Elongation factor 1-alpha 1), which is involved in tRNA delivery to the ribosome, and is known to be activated upregulated upon inflammation [52] . This protein has been shown to physically interact to proteins of several viral species, specifically hepatitis delta [53] and avian reoviruses [54] ; in the latter, knock-down of EEF1A1 has been shown to significantly impair the virus infection cycle. Therefore, the downregulation of EEF1A1 could be the result of an innate cell strategy to deprive SARS-CoV-2 of a key support for RNA replication. Similar to EEF1A1, the NDUFA10 protein network is downregulated by viral infection. NDUFA10 is a member of the mitochondrial complex I [55] . This protein is known to be shut-down upon viral infection of lung A549 cells by human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), a paramyxovirus, also RNA-based [56] . The down-regulation of mitochondrial components in both coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses shows the conservation of RNA viruses strategies to attack the host cell, which passes through the disruption of mitochondria. Another down-regulated network is centered around the T cell anergy-related E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF128, also called GRAIL [57] , which has been reported to provide positive reinforcement of antiviral immune response to RNA viruses [58] . In this case, the inactivation of RNF128, which gets physically bound by two viral nonstructural proteins, NSP7 and NSP13, could be a coronavirus resistance mechanism against the cell innate defense. MRA shows up-regulation (significant in MERS infection, not significant in SARS) of DDX5, DEADbox polypeptide 5, a prototypical member of the RNA helicase family. DDX5 plays multifunctional roles involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism [59] . Since SARS-CoV-2, like all coronaviruses, is a single strand RNA virus, it uses both its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and host proteins to promote the replication of its genetic material. The up-regulation of DDX5 could be another mechanism of viral-triggered cell activation, especially since this protein has been shown to promote the infection capability of encephalitis flaviviruses [60] , which are also RNA viruses. It is important to note that all protein activities are calculated based on physiological coexpression network models, but they are based on largely non-overlapping coexpressed genes, thanks to the DPI step in the corto algorithm. This allows to identify complementary signatures and coresponding networks based on independent gene measurements.",

            "text": "Perhaps the most well-known human protein in relation with beta-coronavirus infection is ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2), a zinc metalloprotease able to hydrolize angiotensin I, angiotensin II, apelin-13 and dynorphin A 1-13 and 7 additional small peptides [61] . ACE2 is exploited by SARS-CoV as its cellular entrance, which is based on the initial interaction between the viral S (spike) protein and ACE2 [62] . Given the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sequences and symptoms it has been suggested that it is the main entry target for both viruses [63] . Its down-regulation upon SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection could intuitively be an innate cell defense mechanism to remove this extracellular marker to reduce the capability of the virus to enter the host cell, while at the same time reducing the RNA metabolic machinery through EEF1A1 down-regulation. ACE2 is also targeted by the neuraminidase protein of influenza A virus [64] . However, the down-regulation of ACE2 has also be shown to be beneficial to viral infection, as it can trigger lung injury and faster cell-to-cell virus spreading [65] . In influenza A (cause by orthomyxoviruses, also RNA-based) high levels of ACE2 have in fact been correlated to increased resistance to the infection [64] . So, like in apoptosis induction, the down-regulation of ACE2 could be a SARS-CoV-2-induced mechanism, from which the virus gains in capability to spread faster by damaging the host lung tissue. Our analysis so far has shown effects on human proteins interacting SARS-CoV-2 based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV signatures. We conjectured that proteins similarly affected by both infections (like ACE2) could have a similar role in all beta-coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis confirms previous reports [14] that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are indeed highly related to SARS-CoV-2, with genome sequence identity of ~80%. However, these two human viruses are not the most likely most direct ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, as highlighted by our phylogenetic analysis (updated on 28-February-2020) based on several beta-coronaviruses ( Figure 4) . The evolutionary history model shows that SARS and MERS viruses are more distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 than wild beta-coronaviruses infecting bats and pangolins. Indeed, there has been an open debate wether pangolins or bats have been the most direct culprits for the zoonotic origin of this virus [66] . Our analysis shows that at least one bat beta-coronavirus sequence derived from the Gisaid database (EPI_ISL_402131) appears to be the closest to the group of human SARS-CoV-2 genomes. However, this is based on a low bootstrap tree branching confidence (37%), and we observed a large quantity of pangolin beta-coronaviruses which are likely to be equidistant from the human causes of COVID-19. Based on our confirmation that ACE2 is an extremely important host protein for viral infection, we set out to compare ACE2 sequences in both bats and pangolins, to detect the most similar sequence to human ACE2. We obtained representative sequences from human ACE2 (NP_068576.1), pangolin ACE2 (Manis javanica XP_017505752.1) and bat ACE2 (AGZ48803.1, from the species Rhinolophus sinicus, being the closest species with a full protein sequence to Rhinolophus affinis, where the closest bat_CoV was retrieved). These sequences appear to be conserved in these species, having the exact same aminoacid length (805aa). The sequence identity between the human and pangolin ACE2 is 84.76%, while the identity between human and bat ACE2 is lower: 80.60% (Figure 5 A) . In Figure 5 B, we provide a visualization of the human ACE2 structure, inferred via X-ray crystallography at 2.20 \u00c5, one of the highest resolutions for this protein [67] , and highlighting all the residuals identical in human and pangolins, but different between humans and bats. Finally, the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of the proteins from the three mammals reports the specific ACE2 aminoacids that differ between the species (Figure 5 C and  Supplementary Table S2 ). The higher similarity between human and pangolin ACE2 proteins could support the hypothesis that pangolin is a better candidate for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Our analysis integrates genome-wide and transcriptome-wide complementary network information on SARS-CoV-2/human interaction to provide a map of host proteins affected by the viral infection. Given the importance of finding new targets to effectively treat this new virus, understanding the molecular effects of this virus on human proteins might be pivotal in prioritizing pharmacological strategies. One of the SARS-CoV-2-interacting protein networks most downregulated by beta-coronaviruses in our analysis was ACE2, and in fact the administration of recombinant ACE2 to compensate this protein loss has been shown to be effective in treating acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is often caused by severe pulmonary infections [68] . This recombinant ACE2, called APN-01, has been proposed as a potential cure for SARS-CoV-2 most severe symptoms [69] [70] [71] , which could be extremely helpful given the observed clinical inefficacy of common antiviral drugs, like corticosteroids [72] . Another point of clinical intervention could be to down-regulate apoptotic mechanisms induced by the virus, e.g. by our reported MCL1 activation upon both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. As we reported, this response is in agreement to previous findings discussing the involvement of MCL1 upregulation in viral replication across many RNA-based viruses [50] , possibly resulting from protein synthesis impairment eliciting ER-stress-induced apoptosis via unfolded protein response (UPR) [73] . Since beta-coronavirus-induced UPR has been shown to modulate innate immunity [74] , targeting aberrant monocytes/macrophages activation may be another possible intervention strategy to reduce severity of coronavirus-induced symptomatology. We also highlighted how mitochondrial proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 appear to be downregulated in beta-coronavirus infections as a general viral mechanism to control host cell metabolism and ultimately steering apoptosis [75] . The goal of preventing mitochondria-induced apoptosis is shared by clinical strategies to slow neurodegenerative pathologies, mainly Alzheimer's disease, where mitochondrial dysfunctions are directly linked to neuronal death [76] . Our study highlights several other proteins that could be directly repressed or enhanced by specific drugs. For example, a mildly virus-activated protein in our network is the serine/threonine kinase MARK2 (Figure 1 ), which is one of the target of the drug Fostamatinib in the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura [77] . Apart from drug repurposing [78] , the recent advances in drug discovery by virtual screening [79] give scientists the chance to quickly develop novel molecules to specifically target not only viral proteins but also the human proteins on whose interaction SARS-CoV-2 depends for infection and replication [80] .

The visualization was obtained through the mraplot function of the R CRAN package corto. In brief, for each analysed network, the centroid is indicated by its gene symbol (e.g. EEF1A1, ACE2). The genes in each network (generated by the corto package from the GTEX healthy lung RNA-Seq dataset) are shown in a barcode-like diagram showing all transcriptome genes by means of their differential expression upon viral infection, from most downregulated (left) to most upregulated (right). Positively-(red) and negatively-(blue) correlated targets are overlayed on the differential expression signature as bars of different color. Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) and p-value are also indicated. To the right, the 12 highest-likelihood network putative targets of each protein are shown, in red if upregulated, in blue if downregulated, with a pointed arrow if predicted to be activated by the centroid protein, and with a blunt arrow if predicted to be repressed. The figure shows two analyses based on the MERS infection signature (A) and on the SARS infection signature (B). Full results are available as Supplementary File S2.",
