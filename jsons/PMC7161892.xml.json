Children under 1 year of age, pregnant or lactating women, an unco\u2010operative child or mother, and those on immunosuppressive drugs or known to have HIV infection, were excluded. Lesions on the face were excluded because of potential stinging or staining of the skin. Subjects were asked to apply the treatment to each individual lesion every night and record the treatment in a diary. Wherever possible, occlusion with cling film or light adhesive tape was suggested, but certain body sites and widely distributed lesions often precluded occlusion. Statistical analysis was on an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis. Repeated \u03c72 analyses (Pearson\u2019s, SPSS statistical package) were scheduled after 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 patients completed, with a prospective stopping rule for P < 0\u00b7003, 0\u00b7011, 0\u00b7016, 0\u00b7019 and 0\u00b7031 on successive analyses. Completion was defined as 3 months, or when the patient was cured or dropped out, if sooner. At least 1 month of treatment was necessary to be valid for efficacy. The log rank test was used to assess differences in cure rate over time, with the last evaluable status carried forward for drop\u2010outs.",

Four of 16 patients stopped the active treatment because of irritation and lack of efficacy, and two further patients who cleared complained of significant irritation. Similar irritation occurred in four of the controls. Lack of efficacy was the primary reason for stopping treatment in 10 of 14 controls.

Irritation was the main reason for stopping the therapy in the four non\u2010responders to active therapy. Although staining of the skin was common in the active treatment group, it only occurred in six of 16. It is unlikely to have led to bias, as the end\u2010point of cure of all lesions is an objective and specific end\u2010point. Staining did not put patients off continuing the treatment, which was done by motivated parents, and could be overcome by reformulating the acidified nitrite, substituting a reducing acid for the salicylic acid. Molluscum is more common in subjects with eczema, and tends to induce eczematization of the surrounding skin. \n20\n\n,\n\n21\n Some such patients tolerate this poorly, but the addition of topical steroids or use of an alternate day schedule has helped other patients. Applying creams under occlusion leads to displacement on to perilesional skin. A more viscous and occlusive formulation with applicators may be more successful. Adhesive tape can also be used and left in place to protect perilesional skin.",

It probably acts on several targets by inhibiting RNA synthesis, DNA replication, early and late viral protein synthesis and by nitrosylating viral structural proteins.\n\n4\n We have shown that higher concentrations of NO from nitrite and ascorbic acid are immunopotentiating. We showed that NO caused lymphocyte, macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, expression of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101 and vascular cell adhesion molecule\u20101 and migration of antigen\u2010presenting cells.\n\n22\n We also showed an increase in p53. It is therefore possible that NO acts through DNA toxicity to infected cells, promoting apoptotic cell death. We have successfully treated genital lesions of molluscum contagiosum and extensive lesions in two subjects with HIV infection. The immunosuppressed patients took longer to clear, suggesting that immunopotentiation contributes to the successful clearance of the virus.",
