Difficulties in estimating R 0 arise both from how a disease transmits through a population as well as from differences in statistical estimation method. We describe eight methods used to estimate R 0 and provide a thorough simulation study of how these estimates change in the presence of different disease parameters. As motivation, we analyze the 2009 outbreak of the H1N1 pandemic influenza in the USA and compare the results from our eight methods to a previous study. We discuss the most important aspects from our results which effect the estimation of R 0 , which include the population size, time period used, and the initial percent of infectious individuals. Additionally, we discuss how pre-processing incidence counts may effect estimates of R 0 . Finally, we provide guidelines for estimating point estimates and confidence intervals to create reliable, comparable estimates of R 0 .",

For example, the Wall Street Journal in February 2020 reported an estimate of R 0 before the impending outbreak of COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, in the West (Craven McGinty, 2020) .

The consequences of this is that despite being nominally the same, R 0 may have a different interpretation depending on the model used. As an example, there are two common types of epidemic frameworks to describe the transmission of infectious disease; SIR and SEIR models. Here, 'S' stands for susceptible, 'I' for infectious, 'R' for recovered or removed, and 'E' for exposed (i.e. infected but not yet infectious). In both models, R 0 is defined in the same manner, namely the infection rate over the recovery rate, R 0 = \u03b2 \u03b3 . However, the two estimates are not directly comparable to one another. An analogy is comparing coefficient \u03b2 1 that appears in two linear regression models, where the second model is nested in the first, as shown in Eq. (1)-(2).",

Our study differs from those previous through a study of different methods to estimate R 0 , emphasis on the data format, and sensitivity to certain disease parameters. However, even in the same model framework (e.g. SIR models), estimates may differ from one another. Difference in estimates can result from mathematical versus statistical methods (i.e. solving for R 0 versus estimating R 0 ), the number of observations used to estimate R 0 (e.g. time steps), population size, initial SI ratio, and model specification. These are all issues for producing point estimates, to say nothing of issues related to estimating confidence intervals (CI). Moreover, there is the important issue of the data itself. Methods to estimate SIR curves typically assume the observed number of Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered (S(t), I(t), R(t)) are available at a number of time steps, but typically those values are unobserved, and we, instead, observe only newly reported cases in a given time interval.",

The SIR model introduced by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) is a compartment model, where individuals move from susceptible, to infectious, and finally recovered states (compartments). We study the SIR model without vital dynamics (e.g. no birth and death into or out of a population). We make five essential assumptions: 1) the compartments are discrete and have no overlap, 2) transition of individuals is described by a set of known equations, possibly dependent on an unknown parameter, 3) the populations mix homogeneously, 4) the number of individuals in each compartment at time t = 0 is known, and 5) the law of mass action is obeyed. The last of these conditions is a property borrowed from chemistry which says that the mass of the product per unit time is proportional to the mass of the reactants (Lotka, 1920) . In epidemiology, this means that the proportion of new infections per unit time is proportional to the current number of susceptible (Anderson & May, 1992) .",

(4), that is, an estimate of R 0 that is a function of XYZ data. We examine both unspecified distribution and specified distribution-based estimates. By unspecified-distribution, we refer to estimates that do not explicitly identify the distributions of random processes. For example, we describe a method that estimates R 0 through minimizing the L 2 norm of the data and expected model estimates. In contrast, distribution-based estimates refer to the methods that do explicitly identify a generative model to incorporate noise. For example, we describe an estimate based on the chain Binomials described by Abbey (1952) , which describes the transmission process via Binomial draws.",

Originally, we included 19 unique methods to estimate R 0 . Many of these 19 methods were similar enough to one another to be combined into one group. For example, some methods used a Binomial variable to model the transmission of new infections whereas others used a Poisson variable but were otherwise the same. A number of these similar methods were hierarchical models where the initial transmission and recovery were modeled with parameters and hyperparameters were then placed upon those parameters. While we recognize the importance and utility of such models, we decided to focus on non-hierarchical models and consider these other models to be variants on these simplified, core models.",

Another answer is that L 2 is a continuously differentiable function and hence is easier to compute, which allows for sensitivity analysis to be conducted more easily.

However, such observations only occur in fairly contrived situations such as small, closed populations where infection time and recovery time are almost immediately known. What is far more common is, instead, to have a fairly good estimate of the population size N and the new case counts (incidence) j(t) on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. From there, the data may be pre-processed into a usable form that the above methods may use. For example, if N is large, the number of susceptibles can be reasonably estimated from the case counts as x(t) = N \u2212 t s=0 j(s), the population size minus the cumulative sum of the incidence over the time period.

This shows some of the non-linearity about the quantity R 0 , as it is not as simple as taking the average R 0 of the equally sized groups.

In Figure 8 , it is clear that estimates of R 0 increase in magnitude as the estimate of \u03b3 \u22121 increases, which makes sense as a longer infectious period leads to more infections. Moreover, we see that the width of the CIs typically increases for the estimates as \u03b3 \u22121 increases and is especially noticeable for rRE. On the other hand, we see that the LBE CI widths are large, which may indicate that the transmission spread does not follow the simple specified likelihood model well. Finally, we see that both EG and MC produce estimates that only increase by a few thousandths for different periods of infectiousness. In contrast, the mean estimate from RE is 1.23 for \u03b3 \u22121 = 3 days and is 1.87 when \u03b3 \u22121 = 9 days. In context, the differences in estimates represent a final size (cumulative percent of infected individuals) difference from 35% to 76%, respectively, or approximately 123 million people in the US.",

This shows the estimates of R 0 using different maximum time points, to get a sense of how R 0 estimates can change with time. The top left graph uses 4 weeks, the top right 8 weeks, bottom left 12 weeks, and bottom right 16 weeks worth of data. The corresponding table of estimates is shown in Table 8 . Overall, from this analysis, we conclude when we assume that \u03b3 \u22121 = 3 days, that R 0 is closer to 1.2 than it is to 1.6, which indicates that, at least within this time frame, R 0 for H1N1 is comparable to that of seasonal influenza where R 0 is estimated to be between 1.19-1.37 (Biggerstaff, Cauchemez, Reed, Gambhir, & Finelli, 2014) . However, our estimate does not factor in how prevention/awareness campaigns influenced the spread of the disease, the differing seasonality of pandemic influenza (the time range we analyze is May-August) compared to seasonal influenza (the time range is typically October-March), and the severity and impact of the infection on the individual. Another possible concern is that of \"backfill,\" the phenomenon of where the number of infections for the different weeks are constantly updated, even months after the original date. As such, we have no guarantee we are using the same numbers from previous analyses. Also, pandemic influenza occurred in two waves in the US, and we are analyzing the first wave, as was done in Towers and Feng (2009) .",
