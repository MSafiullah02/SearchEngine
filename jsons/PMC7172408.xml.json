            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease affecting pigs worldwide, causing considerable economic losses to producers due to its effect on pigs of various ages. It is considered the most economically devastating disease for the global swine industry (Garner et al., 2001, Neumann et al., 2005, Nieuwenhuis et al., 2012, Rowland et al., 2012), costing an estimated $664 million annually in the United States of America alone (Holtkamp et al., 2011). The first PRRS outbreaks in Europe were reported in 1991 (Lindhaus and Lindhaus, 1991), but the disease emerged almost simultaneously in Western Europe and in North America during the late 1980s, presenting as a respiratory disease in young piglets, and as a reproductive failure in sows, evidenced by abortions and the production of mummified foetuses and weak piglets (Done et al., 1996, Halbur et al., 1996a, Batista et al., 2004). PRRS also predisposes infected piglets to infection by other respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens in the respiratory disease complex, leading to even more severe disease.",

Previously considered to be two genotypes of the PRRSV species, PRRSV-1 (European) and PRRSV-2 (North American) are now proposed to be considered two distinct species (Gorbalenya et al., 2014), which despite causing a broadly similar syndrome have a great degree of genetic diversity, sharing only 55\u201370% nucleotide identity (Forsberg et al., 2002).",

Accordingly, great genetic variation exists within each species of PRRSV. A classification with at least nine lineages has been suggested for the North American PRRSV-2 (Shi et al., 2010). European PRRSV-1 can phylogenetically be divided into at least three, possibly four subtypes: pan-European (and in fact global) subtype 1 and Eastern European subtypes 2 and 3, and possibly subtype 4 from Belarus and Latvia (Stadejek et al., 2013). The subtype 1 strains can be further subdivided into at least 12 clades (Shi et al., 2010). Interestingly, while the genetic and antigenic diversity of PRRSV continues to rapidly expand, strains continue to circulate that resemble those found in the early 1990s (Frossard et al., 2013). This is similar to another important RNA virus of livestock, namely bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), where almost identical strains were detected in the UK over a period of a decade (Strong et al., 2012). It equally confirms and challenges our understanding of the evolution of such viruses: on the one hand the evolution and diversity is directly correlated to the host pressure and passages in vivo, on the other side certain \u201cold\u201d variants (strains) continue to persist (Fig. 1\n). This feature of RNA viruses poses increasing challenges both for the design of effective vaccination strategies (Mateu and Diaz, 2008), as well as for consistently effective diagnostic methods.",

Historically they were linked to PRRSV-2, first in the USA (Mengeling et al., 1998) but more recently the emergence of the porcine high fever disease (PHFD), linked to a novel PRRSV-2 strain, observed in China in 2005 (Tian et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2008) and subsequently in other parts of South East Asia (Tong et al., 2007, Metwally et al., 2010). Despite intensive studies of the PHFD-related viruses, the genetic determinants of this increased pathogenicity remain to be fully elucidated, although a recent study reported that mutations in non-structural proteins-9 and -10 may confer an increase in viral virulence (Li et al., 2014). Not surprisingly, several authors have also described differences in virulence among PRRSV-1 strains, finding Eastern European subtype 3 strains significantly more pathogenic than subtype 1 strains (Karniychuk et al., 2010, Weesendorp et al., 2013, Morgan et al., 2013, Morgan et al., 2014, Garc\u00eda-Nicol\u00e1s et al., 2014). Even more recently, the emergence of other virulent PRRSV-1 subtype 1 strains in Western Europe (in Italy and Belgium) (Nauwynck, personal communication) highlights the concerns about the impact and evolution of the disease on this continent.",

PRRSV-1 strains for example have to be adapted in vitro to grow on cells other than myeloid pig cells (most notably porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM)), whereas many PRRSV-2 strains grow easily on MARC-145 (green monkey kidney) cells. In vivo, Halbur et al. (1995) have demonstrated differences in the pathogenicity of PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2. The respiratory disease following infection with PRRSV-1 appears less severe than that seen with PRRSV-2 (Martinez-Lobo et al., 2011). There is a perception that PRRSV-2 causes more severe clinical disease in North America than PRRSV-1 in Western Europe, but direct comparisons of the disease in the field due to the two viruses are difficult due to the differences in commercial swine breeds used and in farming practices between Western Europe and North America. It is therefore warranted to fully separate studies of PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 and avoid generalisations across genotypes unless experimentally thoroughly validated. In the following review, we therefore focus almost exclusively on the respiratory model of PRRSV-1 infection in pigs.",

            "text": "To understand the complex nature of syndromic diseases, experimental in vivo studies are required to further elucidate the interactions between viruses, such as PRRSV, and the porcine host. Given the nature of the two viruses, the strain diversity and the lack of pathogenicity markers, it is understandable that in experimental infections with PRRSV there is great variation in the clinical signs produced. More so, the comparability of PRRSV studies is generally confounded by two variables: namely the co-infection with other pathogens and the pig breed used. The presence of other pathogens is generally not intended as it becomes impossible to attribute biological changes to one or the other and further increases the spectrum of disease observed. Thus the specific freedom of experimental animals from pathogens, such as other common viruses needs to be carefully checked. This, however, has until recently not been broadly possible and remains expensive. In reality, several studies in Europe and North America have been carried out with pigs concomitantly infected with either viral or bacterial pathogens, such as porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) or Mycoplasma spp. In some countries it is virtually impossible to obtain \u201cclean\u201d pigs, which while reflecting the field situation does not provide the basis for sustainable and reproducible research into PRRSV. In addition, variation in the genetic background of the pigs infected also results in considerable differences in the clinical signs seen during disease, as reported in several experimental studies. Lewis et al. (2010) have shown that PRRSV-1 infection affects pregnant gilts differently depending on their breed, while Ait-ali et al. (2007) have demonstrated great differences in the susceptibility of PAMs from pigs of different breeds to infection with PRRSV-1 in vitro. Similar differences in host susceptibility to respiratory disease have also been shown for PRRSV-2 (Boddicker et al., 2013). While the reproductive form of PRRS is very important and contributes greatly to the economic cost of the disease, most of the research to date into the pathogenesis of PRRSV-1 infections has been conducted with piglets, using the respiratory disease model. This is largely due to the understandable physical and financial constraints of conducting large in vivo studies with pregnant gilts, but does represent a real limitation in the experimental infection data available.",

However, despite the development of a number of either inactivated or modified-live PRRSV vaccines, none has yet been demonstrated to be fully efficacious on a large scale in controlling the disease or its spread. One of the challenges in developing improved vaccines is the limited understanding of the immune responses of animals to infection with PRRSV. In contrast to PRRSV-2, cellular immune responses appear to be crucial to achieving protection, while the antibody response overall seems to be less useful for PRRSV-1 (Lowe et al., 2005, Zuckermann et al., 2007). The importance of generating virus neutralising antibodies remains very unclear, perhaps in part due to the difficulty in accurately assessing these with current in vitro techniques. A better understanding of the common features of these immune responses, at least for each genotype individually, is necessary to inform an intelligent approach to the design of improved vaccines.",

Each institute worked with a different conventional subtype 1 strain and a divergent Eastern European subtype 3 strain and the prototype Lelystad virus was included in each study as a standard to aid comparison as was the same source of piglets.

In brief, 5-week-old Yorkshire, Dutch Landrace and Large White crossbred male piglets, from a high health herd, negative for PCV-2, were utilised. At seven weeks of age, after acclimatising for 14 days, the piglets were inoculated intranasally with 105 TCID50 of the respective virus or equivalent volume of \u2018mock\u2019 material as a control. Monitoring of clinical scores and rectal temperatures was performed daily from \u22123 days post-infection (dpi) until the end of the study, at 35 dpi. Blood samples were taken at 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 21, 28 and 35 dpi. At both 3 and 7 dpi, pigs from the control group and from each infected group were euthanised. All remaining animals were euthanised at 35 dpi. Humane end-points were set before the onset of the experiment and any animals that met these criteria were euthanised. At post mortem, gross pathology of the lungs was scored, and both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and tissue samples were collected. Buffered fixed samples from a variety of tissues were processed and stained routinely with H&E for histopathology and immunohistochemical detection of PRRSV antigen, cell markers for macrophages (MAC387) and T cells (CD3) and different cytokines and chemical mediators (Morgan et al., 2014, Amarilla et al., 2015; Garc\u00eda-Nicol\u00e1s et al., 2015).",

The highest gross pathology scores were observed at 7 dpi, with the virulent strains Lena and SU1-Bel displaying the higher scores than Lelystad and field viruses. Infected animals displayed gross pathology lung lesions as early as 3 dpi. However, Lelystad virus did not induce significant pathology at this time point.

The molecules identified or proposed as cellular receptors or mediators for PRRSV entry are heparin sulphate, sialoadhesin (CD169) and the haemoglobin scavenger CD163 (Duan et al., 1998, Van Gorp et al., 2008, Darwich et al., 2010). Whilst viral replication occurs mainly in the lung (Haynes et al., 1997, Ramirez et al., 2008, G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010a, G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010b, G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2013b, Morgan et al., 2014), PRRSV can also be found in lymphoid tissues including the mediastinal, sternal and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen and thymus (Beyer et al., 2000, Labarque et al., 2000, Barranco et al., 2012a, Barranco et al., 2012b, Morgan et al., 2014, G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2013a, Garc\u00eda-Nicol\u00e1s et al., 2015). The virus can persist for long periods of time in lymphoid tissues (Wills et al., 2003) and whilst virus had been cleared from blood (Morgan et al., 2013) we still detected PRRSV antigen at 35 dpi in lungs, local lymph nodes and the thymus. It has been reported recently that the virulent PRRSV-1 Lena strain may replicate in CD163\u2212 sialoadhesin\u2212 cells (Frydas et al., 2013). Since we observed a higher number of infected cells in tissues in pigs infected with virulent subtype 3 strain SU1-Bel, we speculate that this may be attributable to other highly pathogenic strains of PRRSV-1 subtype 3.",

But in contrast to other viruses, a paradigm of PRRSV infection is the initiation of a weak immune response, which may in part explain its ability to persist in different organs. The importance of neutralising antibodies remains unclear and T cell responses appear to be important in achieving clearance of PRRSV infection and protection against re-infection (D\u00edaz et al., 2005, Lowe et al., 2005, L\u00f3pez Fuertes et al., 1999, Zuckermann et al., 2007).",

            "text": "As mentioned, PRRSV-1 shows a marked tropism for cells of the monocyte\u2013macrophage lineage. The main target of PRRSV-1 are alveolar and other tissue macrophages (Lee et al., 2009), and to a lesser extent, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) (Halbur et al., 1996b, Silva-Campa et al., 2010), which has been attributed to different levels of expression of CD169 and CD163. On peripheral blood monocytes, these \u2013 in particular CD163 \u2013 are expressed at low levels and on DC these are variable both in vitro and in vivo (Chamorro et al., 2004, Beitnes et al., 2011; Singleton et al., unpublished). Conversely then, the appearance of PRRSV-1 in DC in situ (Rodr\u00edguez-G\u00f3mez et al., 2013, Morgan et al., 2014), the detection of PRRSV-1 Lena strain in CD163\u2212 sialoadhesin\u2212 cells in an ex vivo nasal mucosa explant culture (Frydas et al., 2013) and the infection of CD163 and CD169 negative monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) with a variety of PRRSV-1 strains in vitro (Weesendorp et al., 2013, unpublished data) demonstrates that CD169 and CD163 are not the only receptors for PRRSV-1 infection. Platelet endothelial tetraspan antigen-3/CD151 been proposed as an additional receptor for PRRSV-2 (Shanmukhappa et al., 2007) and the expression of CD151 on follicular DC (fDC) in human tonsils has been described (Sincock et al., 1997). To which extent CD151 resembles another receptor for PRRSV-1 requires further investigation. We could detect PRRSV-1 antigen in fDC in lymph nodes but this may add further complexity to the situation. fDC are long known to trap antigens and the persistence of antigen on fDC is critical for the initiation of strong IgG and IgE antibody responses (Helm et al., 1995, Wu et al., 1996). More so viable viruses, such as HIV, can be trapped and maintained there for months (Smith et al., 2001). Indeed antibodies to PRRSV were readily detected by ELISA in our experimental infection model (Weesendorp et al., 2013, Morgan et al., 2013) and are used in the field for diagnostic purposes. However, neutralising antibodies were undetectable to any of the virus strains even at the termination of the experiments (35 dpi; Weesendorp et al., 2013, Morgan et al., 2013). This absence of neutralising antibody cannot be attributed to the infection of myeloid cells (such as DC), or the notion that multiple receptors are used. While there are multiple pathways for endocytosis of viruses, it is generally assumed that all viruses make use of specific receptors on host cells and that endocytosis requires activation via surface molecules (Mercer et al., 2010). This implies that, in contrast to the related Arterivirus EAV, which produces high titres of neutralising antibodies, the neutralising epitopes of PRRSV are hidden and only conformationally exposed during the attachment phase.",

The results showed that despite the genetic distance between these strains, animals showed a remarkably similar profile of antigen-reactivity. The major T cell IFN-\u03b3 responses mounted by animals in both groups were to the non-structural proteins nsp1 and nsp2, and the M and GP5 structural proteins. Interestingly all but one of the SU1-Bel infected animals displayed dominant responses to nsp5. nsp5 is a relatively well conserved protein of PRRSV that has previously been identified to carry multiple T cell epitopes (Burgara-Estrella et al., 2013). Further analysis of the antigen has shown it to be an immunodominant target of cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses (Mokhtar et al., unpublished data).",

TNF-\u03b1 was further up-regulated in Lena infected pigs compared to Belgium A, which may have directly contributed to the accompanying fever. In the AHVLA component, cytokine expression analysis conducted using BALF and derived cells. Fig. 4\nsummarises the results of this analysis for both SU1-Bel and LV-infected animals on 7 dpi. To assess how these immune responses may have contributed to the pathology observed each immune response parameter for an individual pig is plotted against the corresponding gross lung pathology score. In the PRRSV-1 SU1-Bel infected group the magnitude of PRRSV-specific BALF antibody response, the leukocytes in BALF and the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2 by these cells showed a significant positive correlation with the gross pathology scores. Conversely, the expression of IL-10 by BALF cells showed a significant negative correlation with pathology. However, none of the immunological parameters showed a significant association with the degree of pathology observed in LV-infected lungs.",

            "text": "While it can be summarised that PRRSV-1 strains did induce a significant immune reaction, other studies concluded that the interaction of PRRSV with the immune system would result in an inhibition of the immune system. For this particularly two strands of evidence have been presented. The first one surrounds the interaction of PRRSV-1 with dendritic cells, where it has been concluded that PRRSV-1 inhibits DC. While the plethora of the DC subsets cannot be reviewed here it needs to be kept in mind that two key variants of DC exist, namely myeloid DC (mDC) which are key to antigen presentation and plasmacytoid DC (pDC), which are specialised upon the IFN-\u03b1 response and thereby switching the immune system on (Merad et al., 2013). Furthermore, within the mDC there are subsets of mDC specialised to cross-present antigen to CD8 T cells, important thus for viral defence. These \u2018CD8\u03b1-like\u2019 mDC populations are conserved across mammalian species including pigs (Contreras et al., 2010, Edwards et al., unpublished data). While PRRSV-1 infects mDC, it does not infect pDC (Baumann et al., 2013), and infection of pDC is not required to initiate an IFN-\u03b1 response such as demonstrated for PRRSV and other viruses (Python et al., 2013). It has been reported that PRRSV-2 fails to initiate an IFN-\u03b1 response and more so inhibits pDC reaction towards other viruses or a TLR-9 agonist (Calzada-Nova et al., 2011). However, a second study could not confirm these results for PRRSV-1 and showed only a partial inhibition by PRRSV-2 (Baumann et al., 2013). Thus, pDC may be a source of systemic IFN-\u03b1 responses reported in PRRSV-infected animals including in our studies and an inhibition only occurs with some strains and to a limited extent.",

It is perhaps not the detrimental interaction of PRRSV-1 with DC but rather the lack thereof that results in a weaker immune response with less pathogenic strains. It is long known that the uptake of antigen by mDC, their transport to the lymph node and their maintenance there sustains a strong immune response (Moll et al., 1995). With our expanding knowledge of the DC system and the knowledge that only certain mDC types are strong inducers of a T cell response, which in turn is crucial for immunity to PRRSV-1, it might be the case that less pathogenic strains simply avoid the interaction with such mDC directly. Thereby rather than suppressing the immune reaction most PRRSV-1 strains fail to initiate a strong and adequate immune reaction.",

            "text": "Another way to reduce the immune reaction is via various forms of suppression, mediated by regulatory (suppressor) T cells and related cytokines, namely IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2. Regulatory T cells (Treg) exist in two forms, namely natural Treg (nTreg) which are thymus-derived and antigen-independent versus induced Treg (iTreg), which are antigen-specific and the result of a DC\u2013T cell interactions (Josefowicz et al., 2012). The fact that some strains of PRRSV-1 induce IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 has paved the way for speculation that Treg are a key factor in the pathogenesis of PRRSV (Cecere et al., 2012, Wongyanin et al., 2012, Gimeno et al., 2011). More so, PRRSV-2 was shown in two studies to generate iTreg responses in vivo (Silva-Campa et al., 2012, Wongyanin et al., 2012). However, a previous study failed to demonstrate the induction of iTreg through PRRSV-1 in vitro (Silva-Campa et al., 2010) and in our study we were unable to detect increased levels of iTreg cells in blood or BALF (Morgan et al., 2013). It must not be forgotten in this context that both IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 were originally not identified as immunosuppressive cytokines and both cytokines have a plethora of functions, most of which are immune-reactive. Likewise it has been suggested that iTregs are the physiological result of a prolonged immune-stimulation (Walker et al., 2005) to avoid chronic inflammations for example. While this is indeed a hallmark of iTreg function, it could also be a piece in the jigsaw of PRRSV-1 pathogenesis, since most strains of PRRSV-1 result in a chronic infection where a sustained immune reaction can be measured.",
