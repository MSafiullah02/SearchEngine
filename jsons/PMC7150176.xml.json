The 3 Old World camelids (OW) are the dromedary, the domestic Bactrian camel, and the wild Bactrian camel. The lineage of New World camelids (NW) has been more controversial, though most now agree it consists of the genus Lama and a separate genus Vicugna. The llama belongs to Lama glama and the guanaco belongs to L. guanicoe. The alpaca and vicu\u00f1a belong to Vicugna pacos and V. vicugna, respectively. Interbreeding between NW species and between OW species produce fertile crosses, but to date fertile young have not been produced by crosses between NW and OW camelids (Fowler, 2010c). Only the free-ranging population of wild Bactrian camel is endangered. Bactrian camels held in zoos are generally of domestic origin. Vicu\u00f1a are listed as vulnerable. This chapter focuses on diseases of camelids, most of which have been described in domesticated and zoo animals. Where disease has also been described in free-range animals, it will be specifically mentioned.",

            "text": "Anatomically, the anterior digestive tract is the most important and exceptional feature in camelids. Camelids are foregut fermenters, but the anatomy of the foregut is markedly different from that of other ruminants. A common nomenclature has not been adopted, but most divide the stomach into three compartments: C-1, C-2, and C-3 (Vallenas et al., 1971). Unlike other ruminants, all of the compartments have glandular regions and none have papillae. C-1 fills the left abdomen and is partially divided into cranial and caudal sacs by a tranverse pillar. Glandular saccules are present along the ventral aspect of both the cranial and caudal sacs (Fig. 7.2\nA). The mucosa of C-2 is largely glandular except for an area along the lesser curvature that forms the esophageal groove. The remaining mucosal surface of C-2 is criss-crossed by bands or crests covered by stratified squamous epithelium forming deep pockets that are lined by glandular epithelium. C-3 is lined entirely by glandular epithelium that appears in three patterns. In the first fifth of its length, there is a retiform (net-like) pattern of shallow depressions along the lesser curvature and folds of mucosa along the greater curvature. In the middle three fifths of C-3, there are permanent longitudinal folds. In the distal fifth of C-3, the mucosa is lined by true gastric glands, is more deeply red and smoother, and the wall is thicker. The pH drops abruptly from 6.5 to 2.0 in the terminal region of C-3.",

New World camelids have evolved in the presence of highly variable food resources, with a \u201cfeast and famine\u201d routine \u2013 periods of high dietary input followed by very low input. Because of this physiologic adaptation, over feeding in captive and domesticated NW camelids is common and can lead to significant consequences. Maintaining and monitoring proper body condition in camelids can be challenging. Due to their heavy wool, NW camelids may be too thin and managers will not recognize this unless they are palpated. In OW camels, there is not a similar \u201cfeast and famine\u201d syndrome, but these animals are well adapted to storing nutrients and maintaining condition with poor quality feeds. The hump stores fat and will increase and decrease in size and firmness depending on the nutritional condition (Fowler, 2010b).",

This condition is commonly diagnosed in camelids, both NW and OW, and is similar to that described in ruminants (Milad and Ridha, 2009). Grossly, diffuse swelling and multifocal necrosis of the cerebral cortex is seen in the superficial gray matter with occasional extension into the underlying white matter. Yellow areas of discolored necrotic tissue will autofluoresce under ultraviolet light (Fig. 7.6\n). Histologically, bilateral laminar necrosis of the neurons in the deep laminae, edema of the superficial laminae, and gliosis are characteristic. While necrosis is most typically seen in the cerebrum, it can also be found in the cerebellum. Gliosis will vary with the age of the lesion, being more prominent as the lesion matures. Very chronic lesions may contain cystic cavities (Kiupel et al., 2003, Whitehead and Bedenice, 2009).",

In particular, environmental, metabolic, or social stress and the release of corticosteroids is likely to lead to persistent hyperglycemia. Dehydration is the most common and clinically significant sequela to persistent hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and glucose diuresis.

In rare cases, hepatic changes may be so severe as to cause the liver to float in formalin or water. Histologically, changes are diffuse with large clear, distinct cytoplasmic vacuoles and peripheralized nuclei in hepatocytes. Pregnant and lactating camelids are prone to lipidosis in a manner similar to ketotic ruminants with inadequate carbohydrates in the diet (Cebra, 2009). In other NW camelids, stressful events and/or hepatic toxins are more likely responsible. Secondary hepatoencephalopathy associated with lipidosis has been described in llamas. Alzheimer type II astrocytosis in the cerebrum and to a lesser extent in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum are present in affected animals (Pillitteri and Craig, 2012). Decreased astrocytic immunohistochemical labelling intensity for glial fibrillary acid protein is seen in the brains of neurological llamas with hepatic dysfunction. In addition, distinct from ruminants, fat can accumulate in renal tubular epithelium under similar circumstances as hepatic lipidosis and lead to kidney dysfunction in camelids.",

Vitamin E is a fat soluble nutrient that cannot be stored in the liver, so daily ingestion is required. With very severe deficiency, cardiac and skeletal muscle degeneration and necrosis develop; mineralization may be present in areas of necrosis. Heavily used muscles such as the intercostals, diaphragm, and tongue are commonly affected. Cardiac necrosis can lead to sudden death; important differentials for sudden cardiac death due to cardiomyonecrosis are oleander or ionophore toxicity, both of which are relatively common in captive camelids. It is likely that other plants throughout the natural ranges of camelids and ornamental plants used in zoos have similar cardiotoxic effects. In addition to feed and tissue level testing for selenium and Vitamin E, toxicologic testing may be required to rule out toxins when myocardial necrosis is seen.\n",

The disease may be unilateral or bilateral and is most often seen on the left ovary though studies vary in the specific percentages of unilateral versus bilateral lesions. Grossly, the bursa is usually mildly to markedly distended by hemorrhagic fluid (Fig. 7.10\n). Histologically, there is degeneration and hyperplasia of the bursal epithelial lining; infiltration of the lining by variably intense aggregates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages; cysts within the epithelial lining; multiple variably expansive regions of hemorrhage; and intralesional hemosiderin-laden macrophages. The high estrogen content of the bursal fluid in this condition suggests it is a mixture of hemorrhage and follicular fluid (the estrogen content of the distended bursa tends to be much higher than serum). While a specific cause has not been proven, over 86% of camels with hydrobursitis have serological evidence of Chlamydia abortus infection, suggesting this organism may be involved in the pathogenesis (Ali et al., 2012).

A history of high environmental temperatures, high humidity, physical activity, social stress, dehydration, and/or fever in a heavily fleeced down, moribund or dead NW camelid is highly suggestive of hyperthermia or heat stress. Tissues will rapidly autolyze under these conditions, so prompt post mortem inspection is critical to make a diagnosis. Lesions suggestive of hyperthermia include petechial hemorrhages, hyperemia, thrombosis, pulmonary edema and congestion, neuronal necrosis, hepatic necrosis, and renal tubular necrosis (Fowler, 2010g). Hypothermia can also be a concern in NW and OW camelids kept in northern climates where frostbite can occur; it primarily affects the ears. Some NW camelids have congenitally shortened ears (\u201cgopher ear\u201d) that can be distinguished from healed frostbite by the presence of fibrosis and alopecia at the squared margin of the latter, distinct from the haired and tapered tip of the former (Fowler, 2010g).",

In C-1 and C-2, ulcerations are typically noted along the margins of saccules primarily in the glandular regions (Fig. 7.11\n). In C-3, ulcers are typically linear along the longitudinal pleats in the proximal 4/5th, but are focal and deeper in the last 1/5th. Expansive ulcers may occur at the margin of compartment C-2 and C-3. These are most often seen in neonates with hypothermia, sepsis, or during periods of social or metabolic stress. Ulcers in the distal part of C-3 are the most likely to perforate, leading to peritonitis and rapid death. Underlying causes of ulcer development is poorly understood and likely multifactorial. Social and environmental stresses and associated catecholamine secretion has been suggested. Hypercortisolism is associated with acid hypersecretion in the gastric lumen of other species and is presumed to also be the case in camelids. Duodenal reflux and gastric vasoconstriction may also be factors in stressed animals. There is no acid secretion in C-1, however, so ulceration in this area cannot be explained by this mechanism. Other lesions that might be associated with stress-induced gastric ulceration are lymphoid atrophy and adrenal cortical hyperplasia, the latter used to build a case for stress induced disease when ulceration is noted at postmortem examination.",

With the exception of bovine leukemia virus induced lymphosarcoma, confirmed by in situ hybridization and serology in a 13-month old alpaca (Lee et al., 2012), no underlying etiologies or predisposing factors have been confirmed in lymphosarcoma (or any other cancer) of camelids.

It is an OIE listed reportable disease and is the most common viral disease in dromedary and Bactrian camels. It is zoonotic and capable of infecting immunocompetent humans, though it is more likely to cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals. With electron microscopy this virus appears as brick-shaped, enveloped particles with rounded edges measuring 360 \u03bcm x 270 \u03bcm x 250 \u03bcm. Parapoxviruses can be differentiated by their more ovoid shape than camelpox. Camelpox has been experimentally reproduced in NW camelids, though it is not present in the Americas or Australia.\nTransmission is usually due to direct exposure through skin abrasions or inhalation of infected secretions from lesions, milk, saliva, blood, ocular or nasal secretions, or urine. Arthropods, including flies and ticks, are suspected vectors. Upon entry, the virus replicates locally producing a primary erythematous lesion. The infection then spreads to local lymph nodes and a leukocyte-associated viremia develops (Balamurugan et al., 2013). During this time virus can be identified in skin, turbinates, lungs, and lymphoid organs. A few days after viremia begins, widespread secondary skin lesions (typical pox) appear and persist for 2\u20133 days until viremia subsides. Like other poxviral diseases, camelpox virus encodes multiple genes that modulate the host immune response by interfering with interferon (IFN), pro-inflammatory cytokines [(Interleukin-IL-1b, IL-18 and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs)], chemokines, and complement (Duraffour et al., 2011).",

Lesions typically affect the head, nostrils, ear margins and eyelids (Fig. 7.12\n). Mucous membranes, including the lips, and oral and nasal cavities, can be affected and infection may also spread to other parts of the body including the genitalia and mammary gland. Healing can take up to 4\u20136 weeks and can leave scars or cause multifocal alopecia (Balamurugan et al., 2013). Lesions are most commonly found in the skin, but a disseminated form may also occur in young animals stressed by weaning or poor husbandry. In this form, similar crusting lesions may spread more widely, particularly affecting the head and the limbs but also the neck and abdomen. In the most severe cases, proliferative necrotizing lesions in the oral cavity or respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts may lead to death. These animals demonstrate hypersalivation, anorexia, mucopurulent nasal and ocular discharge, and diarrhea. Abortion can also occur. Death is often due to secondary bacterial infection and subsequent septicemia.",

Clinical signs in humans vary from mild to severe and life-threatening. Dromedary camels likely play a role in transmission to humans, though how this occurs is currently unclear (Younan et al., 2012). Serosurveys suggest the virus has been circulating in camels since the 1980s, well before the disease was recognized in humans in 2012. The virus appears to infect and spread among young camels more readily than older camels, but there are no documented lesions in camels. The virus is significant for the substantial risk it poses to humans exposed to camels shedding the virus. Experimental infections of alpacas with MERS-CoV showed successful infection, replication, and transmission of the virus (Adney et al., 2016).",

NW camelids appear to be very susceptible to this infection. It is acquired via inhalation of infectious arthrospores. The fungus is endemic in desert areas of southern California, the San Joaquin Valley, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the United States; as well as desert areas of northern Mexico, Northwest Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua (Fowler, 2010e). Coccidioidomycosis usually presents as a respiratory disease. However, disseminated disease is common and can cause lesions affecting the neurological system, heart, liver, kidney, skin, bone, eyes, or lymphoid tissues; clinical signs reflect the location of the lesions (Coster et al., 2010, Fowler et al., 1992). Granulomas or granulomatous inflammation surrounding intralesional fungal arthroconidia, spherules, and endospores are characteristic, and inflammation can coalesce into large masses that efface organs. Inflammation surrounding freshly ruptured spherules may be suppurative. Multinucleated giant cells may also be present. In its parasitic form, infective arthroconidia transform into immature spherules (10 \u03bcm -20 \u03bcm in diameter) that mature into large, up to 200 \u03bcm diameter mature spherules (or sporangia) filled with 2 \u03bcm - 5 \u03bcm endospores. Sporangia subsequently rupture, releasing endospores into adjacent tissue that form new spherules, or if they are released into the environment, the endospores form mycelia. Aerosolized endospores can be a significant zoonotic threat, especially in a laboratory setting if appropriate precautions are not followed (Caswell and Williams, 2016).",

The life cycle includes ingestion of larvae, which then penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the liver and lung. Maturation occurs after migration up the trachea, re-ingestion, and migration back to the small intestine. Migration through the intestinal wall leads to severe catarrhal and hemorrhagic enteritis. Hepatic lesions include coagulative necrosis, hemorrhage, and multiple small abscesses, which if the animal survives will become fibrotic and mineralized. The mountain viscacha, a South American rodent, is considered the definitive host. How this infection might be maintained outside of South America is unknown (Fowler, 2010h).",

In the host, adult worms live in the veins of the dura mater where the eggs and larvae enter the blood vessels, flow to the lungs, and infiltrate the alveoli.

Larvae mature in the gray matter dorsal horns and adults then migrate to the brain via the subdural space and finally through the dura mater to the venous sinuses.

Acute massive infections can lead to bile stasis, liver degeneration and necrosis, hepatic insufficiency, and death. More commonly, chronic infections are characterized by bile duct obstruction and bile stasis with cholangitis and bile epithelial hyperplasia (Hilbe et al., 2015). Anemia and hypoproteinemia are common, and an unthrifty condition and particularly poor wool quality develops. Grossly, hepatic fibrosis and ascites are prominent. Regenerative hepatic nodules, mineralized foci, and abscesses may also be present. Histologically, in chronically infected animals, the liver contains multifocal to regionally extensive and occasionally coalescing areas of abundant fibrosis with biliary hyperplasia that surrounds regenerative nodules. Neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells, and some macrophages are free in the parenchyma, periportal, and in the lumina of bile ducts. Flukes and their ova are often found in affected areas in the bile ducts and within the parenchyma. Characteristic features of trematodes are their tegument, lack of body cavity, and the presence of both gonads (hermaphrodites). Flukes found in camels can be differentiated by their size and the presence of spines. Fasciola spp. are the largest flukes in camelids (cm vs. mm) and have spines on their tegument. F. hepatica ova are large (120 mm \u2013140 mm) and lack a miracidium. D. dendriticum ova are small (40 mm x 25 mm) oval, have a golden wall, are operculated, and contain a miracidium.

Histologically, the density of meronts and gamonts within the mucosa of the jejunum and ileum is often remarkable and they may efface the parenchyma leaving little remaining unaffected tissue (Fig. 7.14\nA, B). Necrosis and loss of villi are the primary lesions, though in more chronic cases, severe fibrosis in the lamina propria may occur. The colon and duodenum are rarely affected.

Trypanosoma evansii causes surra in camels and is found in Southeast, East, and Central Asia, as well as North Africa (T. evansii has been reported from South America; it has not been identified in NW camelids). The tsetse fly (Glossinia spp.) is the intermediate host and after feeding on the blood of an infected animal, the organisms multiply in the fly\u2019s hindgut and are deposited as metamorphosed trypanosome in the salivary secretions when the fly takes its next blood meal. Two syndromes have been reported in camels: an acute and chronic form. In acute surra, there is fever, anemia, edema, and weakness that progresses to paralysis. Pulmonary edema may lead to secondary pneumonia. Abortion and caseous mastitis have also been reported. Death usually occurs within weeks and there are many parasites in blood smears (Fig. 7.15\n). In the more chronic form, there is intermittent fever, anemia and edema, and progressive loss of condition. Between febrile episodes, finding organisms in blood smears may be challenging, so sample collection should coincide with periods of fever.\n",

It would be expected that lesions might be similar, and consist of interstitial pneumonia, myocardial degeneration and myocarditis, bone marrow atrophy, lymphadenitis with follicular hyperplasia followed by atrophy and sclerosis, thymic atrophy, and renal membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and interstitial fibrosis (Valli et al., 2016). In cattle, organisms are most often seen in the liver and the cerebral cortex, though they may be found in any organ (Valli et al., 2016). PCR assays have been developed and can be used in camels.",

Old World camels are primary host of the camel bot, Cephalopina titillator, which can lead to significant morbidity and rare mortality (Oryan et al., 2008). Nasopharyngeal mucous membranes are congested and edematous and covered by adherent layers of hemorrhage, mucus, and fibrin. Histologically, the mucosa is hyperplastic and infiltrated by lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophils; fibrosis develops in more chronic cases. Goblet cell hyperplasia and dilation of submucosal secretory glands may also be present. In rare cases, larvae may migrate through the ethmoturbinates resulting in parasitic meningitis and death.",

Psorioptic and chorioptic mange mites are not considered host specific, can be transmitted across species, and may be zoonotic. Mange syndromes are similar across species and are described elsewhere in this text. Briefly, sarcoptic mange is characterized by crusted papules and pustules primarily on the limbs and ventrum, with hyperkeratosis and frequent secondary bacterial infection. Thickening of the skin is a differentiating feature of sarcoptic mange. Psoroptic mange produces moist papules progressing to crusts, on the shoulders, back, sides, and tailhead, as well as in the ears with subsequent fiber loss. Dermatitis induces pruritus, but there is little thickening of the skin. Chorioptic mange is less common, but has similar lesions to psoroptic mange. All forms of mange are reportable in the US; they may also be reportable in other jurisdictions.\n",
