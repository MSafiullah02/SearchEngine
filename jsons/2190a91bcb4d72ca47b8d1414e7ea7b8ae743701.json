To analyze the supply shock, we classify industries as essential or non-essential and construct a Remote Labor Index, which measures the ability of different occupations to work from home. Demand shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic developed by the US Congressional Budget Office. Compared to the pre-COVID period, these shocks would threaten around 22% of the US economy's GDP, jeopardise 24% of jobs and reduce total wage income by 17%. At the industry level, sectors such as transport are likely to have output constrained by demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining and services are more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants and tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply and demandside shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable. We should emphasize that our results are only first-order shocks -we expect them to be substantially amplified by feedback effects in the production network.",

To give an example based on survey data in an economy under lockdown, the French statistical office estimated on March 26 that the economy is currently at around 65% of its normal level 1 . Bullard (2020) provides an undocumented estimate that around a half of the US economy would be considered either essential, or able to operate without creating risks of diffusing the virus. Inoue & Todo (2020) modeled how shutting down firms in Tokyo would cause a loss of output in other parts of the economy through supply chain linkages, and estimate that after a month, daily output would be 86% lower than pre-shock (i.e. the economy would be operating at only 14% of its capacity!). Using a calibrated extended consumption function, and assuming a labor income shock of 16% and various consumption shocks by expenditure categories, Muellbauer (2020) estimates a fall of quarterly consumption of 20%. Roughly speaking, most of these estimates, like ours, are estimates of instantaneous declines, and would translate to losses of annual GDP if the lockdown lasted for a year.",

Deriving overall impact estimates involves modeling second-order effects, such as the additional reductions in demand as workers who are stood down or laid off experience a reduction in income and additional reductions in supply as potential shortages propagate through supply chains. Further effects, such as cascading firm defaults, which can trigger bank failures and systemic risk in the financial system, could also arise. Understanding these impacts requires a model of the macro-economy and financial sector. We intend to present results from such an economic model in the future, but in the meantime we want to make our estimates of first order impacts available for researchers or governments to build upon or use in their own models.",

If consumers reduce their demand by 90%, the industry will produce only what will be bought, that is, 10%. If instead consumers reduce their demand by 20%, the industry will not be able to satisfy demand but will produce everything it can, that is, 70%. In other words, the experienced first order reduction in output from the immediate shock will be the greater of the supply shock or the demand shock. In other words, most of the first-order impact on the economy will be due to an inability of people to work rather than to consume. However, again, we expect that as wages from work drop, there will be potentially larger second-order negative impacts on demand, and the potential for a self-reinforcing downward spiral in output, employment, income, and demand.",

Other industries such as manufacturing, mining and certain service sectors are likely to experience larger immediate supply-side shocks relative to demand-side shocks. Health unsurprisingly experiences an overall increase in demand for its output. Entertainment, restaurants and hotels experience very large supply and demand shocks, with the demand shock dominating. These results are important because supply and demand shocks might have different degrees of persistence, and industries will react differently to policies depending on the constraints that they face. Overall, however, we find that aggregate effects are dominated by supply shocks, with a large part of manufacturing and services being classified as non-essential while its labor force is unable to work from home.",

(And bear in mind that this is only a first-order shock -second order shocks may significantly increase this).

Within an industry, we also assume that if workers in a given occupation cannot work, they do not produce output, but this does not prevent other workers in different occupations from producing. In both cases we assume that the effects of labor on production are linear, i.e. that production is proportional to the fraction of workers who can work. In reality however, it is clear that there are important complementarities leading to nonlinear effects. There are many situations where production requires a combination of different occupations, such that if workers in key occupations cannot work at home, production is not possible. For example, while the accountants in a steel plant might be able to work from home, if the steelworkers needed to run the plant cannot come to work, no steel is made. We cannot avoid making linear assumptions because as far as we know there is no detailed understanding of the labor production function and these interdependencies at an industry level. By neglecting nonlinear effects, our work here should consequently be regarded as an approximate lower bound on the size of the first order shocks. This paper focuses on the United States. We have chosen it as our initial test case because input-output tables are more disaggregated than those of most other countries, and because the O*NET database, which we rely on for information about occupations was developed based on US data. With some additional assumptions it is possible to apply the analysis we perform here to other developed countries.",

In Section 4, we show a comparison of the supply and demand shocks across different industries and occupations and identify the extent to which different activities are likely to be constrained by supply or demand. In this section, we also explore which occupations are more exposed to infection and make comparisons to wage and occupation-specific shocks.

(2013) ), although some have also noted the potentially large impact of school closure (Keogh-Brown et al. 2010) . McKibbin & Fernando (2020) consider (among other shocks) reduced labor supply due to mortality, morbidity due to infection, and morbidity due to the need to care for affected family members. In countries where social distancing measures are in place, social distancing measures will have a much larger economic effect than the direct effects from mortality and morbidity. This is in part because if social distancing measures work, only a small share of population will be infected and die eventually. Appendix D.1 provides more quantitative estimates of the direct mortality and morbidity effects and argues that the they are likely to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than those due to social distancing measures, especially if the pandemic is contained.",

In Which work activities can be performed from home? Four of us independently assigned a subjective binary rating to each work activity as to whether it could successfully be performed at home. The individual results were in broad agreement. Based on the responses, we assigned an overall consensus rating to each work activity 4 . Ratings for each work activity are available in an online data repository 5 . From work activities to occupations. We then created a Remote Labor Index (RLI) for each occupation by calculating the proportion of an occupation's work activities that can be performed at home. An RLI of 1 would indicate that all of the activities associated with an occupation could be undertaken at home, while an RLI of 0 would indicate that none of the occupation's activities could be performed at home. 7 The resulting ranking of each of the 740 occupations can be found in the online repository (see footnote 5). While the results are not perfect 8 , most of the rankings make sense. For example, in Table  1 , we show the top 20 occupations having the highest RLI ranking. Some occupations such as credit analysts, tax preparers and mathematical technician occupations are estimated to be able to perform 100% of their work activities from home.

            "text": "Across the world, many governments have mandated that certain industries deemed 'essential' should remain open over the COVID-19 crisis duration. What constitutes an 'essential' industry has been the subject of significant debate, and it is likely that the endorsed set of essential industries will vary across countries. As the U.S. government has not produced a definitive list, here we draw on the list of essential industries developed by Italy and assume it can be applied, at least as an approximation, to other countries such as the U.S. as well. This list has two key advantages. First, as Italy was one of the countries affected earliest and most severely, it was one of the first countries to invest significant effort considering which industries should be deemed essential. Second, Italy's list of essential industries includes NACE industrial classification codes, which can be mapped to the NAICS industry classification we use to classify industrial employment in this paper. 10 Table 2 shows the total numbers of NAICS essential industries at the 6-digit and 4-digit level. More than 50% of 6-digit NAICS industries are considered essential. At the 6-digit level the industries are either classified as essential, and assigned essential score 1, or non-essential and assigned essential score 0. Unfortunately, it is not possible to translate this directly into a labour force proportion as BLS employment data at detailed occupation and industry levels are only available at the NAICS 4-digit level. To derive an estimate at the 4-digit level, we assume that labor in a NAICS 4-digit code is uniformly distributed over its associated 6-digit codes. We then assign an essential 'share' to each 4-digit NAICS industry based on the proportion of its 6-digit NAICS industries that are considered essential. (The distribution of the essential share over 4-digit NAICS industries is shown in the Appendix). Based on this analysis, we estimate that about 89 million (or 64%) of US workers are currently employed in essential industries.",

NACE industry codes at the 4-digit level are internationally defined. However, 6-digit level NACE codes are country specific. Moreover, the list of essential industries developed by Italy involves industries defined by varying levels of aggregation. Most essential industries are defined at the NACE 2-digit and 4-digit level, with a few 6-digit categories thrown in for good measure. As such, much of our industrial mapping methodology involved mapping from one classification to the other by hand. We provide a detailed description of this process in Appendix B.1.",

While the analysis is highly relevant to the present COVID-19 situation, it is important to note that the estimates are \"extremely rough\" and \"based loosely on Hong Kong's experience with SARS\". The CBO provides two scenarios. We take the severe scenario, which \"describes a pandemic that is similar to the 1918-1919 Spanish flu outbreak. It incorporates the assumption that a particularly virulent strain of influenza infects roughly 90 million people in the United States and kills more than 2 million of them\".",

The CBO lists demand side estimates for broad industry categories, which we mapped to the 2-digit NAICS codes by hand. Table 3 shows the CBO's estimates of the percent decrease in demand by industry, and Table 8 in Appendix E shows the full mapping to 2-digit NAICS. These estimates, of course, are far from perfect. They are based on expert estimates made more than ten years ago for an hypothetical pandemic scenario. It is not entirely clear if they are for gross output or for final (consumer) demand. However, in Appendix E, we describe three other sources of consumption shocks (Keogh-Brown et al. 2010 , Muellbauer 2020 , OECD 2020 ) that provide broadly similar estimates by industry or spending category.",

To characterize supply shocks, we developed a Remote Labor Index to estimate the extent to which workers can perform activities associated with their occupation at home and identified which industries are classified as essential vs. non-essential. We also reported plausible estimates of the demand shocks, in an attempt to acknowledge that some industries will have an immediate reduction in output due to a shortfall in demand, rather due to an impossibility to work. We would like to emphasize that these are predictions, not measurements: The estimates of the demand shocks were made in 2006, and the RLI and the list of non-essential industries contain no pandemic-specific information, and could have been made at any time. Putting these predictions together, we estimate that the first order aggregate shock to the economy represents a reduction of roughly a quarter of the economy. This is the first study seeking to compare supply-side shocks with corresponding demand-side shocks at the occupation and industry level. At the time of writing, the most relevant demand-side estimates available are highly admittedly 'rough' and only available for very aggregate (2-digit) industries. Yet, this suggests that sectors such as Transport are more likely to have output constrained by demand-side shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining and services are more likely to be constrained by supply-side shocks. Entertainment, restaurants and tourism face both very large supply and demand constraints, with demand shocks dominating in our estimates. By quantifying supply and demand shocks by industry, our paper speaks to the debate on the possibility of inflation after the crisis. Goodhart & Pradhan (2020) argue that the lockdown causes a massive supply shock that will lead to inflation when demand comes back after the crisis. But as Miles & Scott (2020) note, in many sectors it is not obvious that demand will come back immediately after the crisis, and if a gradual reopening of the economy takes place, it may be that supply and demand rise slowly together. However, our paper is the first to raise the fact that because supply and demand shocks are so different by sectors, even a gradual reopening may leave important supply-demand imbalances within industries. Such mismatches could consequently lead to an unusual level of heterogeneity in the inflation for different goods.",

            "text": "For policymakers there are three key implications from this study. First, the magnitude of the shocks being experienced by the U.S. economy is very large, with around a quarter of the economy not functioning. As Table 4 shows, even including positive shocks, our estimates of the potential impacts are a drop in employment of 24%, a decline in wages of 17%, and loss in value added of 22%. Bearing in mind the caveats about shocks vs. total impacts, the potential impacts are a multiple of what was experienced during the global financial crisis (e.g. where employment dropped 3.28 percentage points) 17 and comparable only to the Great Depression (e.g. where employment dropped 21.7% 1929-32 (Wallis 1989 , Table 2 )). Second, as the largest shocks are from the supply-side, strategies for returning people to work as quickly as possible without endangering public health must be a priority. Virus mitigation and containment are clearly essential first steps, but strategies such as widespread antibody testing to identify people who are safe to return to work, and rapid testing, tracing, and isolation to minimize future lock-downs, will also be vital until if and when a vaccine is available. Furthermore, aggressive fiscal and monetary policies to minimize first-order shocks cascading into second-order shocks are essential, in particular policies to keep workers in employment and maintain incomes (e.g. the \"paycheck protection\" schemes announced by several countries), as well as policies to preserve business and financial solvency. Third, and finally, the inequalities highlighted by this study will also require policy responses. Again, higher income knowledge and service workers will likely see relatively little impact, while lower income workers will bear the brunt of the employment, income, and health impacts. In order to ensure that burdens from the crisis are shared as fairly as possible, assistance should be targeted at those most effected, while taxes to support such programs be drawn primarily from those least effected.",

Overall impacts can be very different form first order shocks for several reasons: First, shocks to a particular sector propagate and may be amplified as each industry faces a shock and reduces its demand for intermediate goods from other industries. Second, industries with decreased output will stop paying wages of furloughed workers, thereby reducing income and demand. Third, the few industries facing higher demand will increase supply, if they can overcome labor mobility frictions (del Rio-Chanona et al. 2019). We make our predictions of the shocks available here so that other researchers can improve upon them and use them in their own models 18 . We intend to update and use these shocks ourselves in our models in the near future.",

We have constructed our remote labor index based on a subjective rating of work activities and we assumed that all work activities are equally important and they are additive. We have also applied a rating of essential industries for Italy to the U.S. Nonetheless, we believe that the analysis here provides a useful starting point for macroeconomic models attempting to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy.",

As new data becomes available for the mitigation measures different states and countries are taking, we can also refine our analysis to account for different government actions. Thus we hope that the usefulness of methodology we have presented here goes beyond the immediate application, and will provide a useful framework for predicting economic shocks as the pandemic develops. Figure 9 illustrates our method. There are four sets of nodes which are connected by three bipartite networks. The first set of nodes are the 6-digit NAICS industries which are classified to be essential or non-essential. This information is encoded in the K-dimensional column vector u which element u k = 1 if NAICS 6-digit industry k is essential and 0 otherwise. Second, there are N different industry categories on which our economic analysis is based. The 6-digit NAICS codes are connected to these industries by the incidence matrix (concordance table) S.

Though many high wage occupations are highly exposed to infection (high paid doctors), there are also many low wage occupations with high probability of infection. (2020) consider attack rates (share of population who become sick) in the range 1-30% and case-fatality rates (share of those infected who die) in the range 2-3%. From attack rates and case fatality rates, they compute mortality rates. They also assume that sick people stay out of work for 14 days. A third effect they assume is that workers would be care givers to family members.",

For those working from home, we might expect a decline in productivity. Finally, for those in essential industries, it is likely that schools are not close. For instance, in the UK, schools are opened for children of essential workers. Our list of essential industries from Italy includes Education. 29 https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html 30 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=IT Overall, school closure indeed have large effects, but in the current context these may already be accounted for by supply and demand shocks, or non-existent because schools are not fully closed.
