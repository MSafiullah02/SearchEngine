            "text": "In Kenya, the most significant cause of death by broad group is HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB [9]. HIV/AIDS was the leading cause of death in Kenya in 2012, contributing to 54,400 deaths or 14.4% of all death country-wide [9]. Malaria caused 12,000 deaths (3.2%), while TB caused 9400 deaths (2.5%) [9]. Diarrheal diseases also contributed to 23,400 deaths (6.5%) in Kenya [9]. These mortality rates of infectious diseases in Kenya suggest that these types of diseases are of critical concern in the country. Unfortunately, in addition to these diseases, there are also many neglected tropical diseases. This list of diseases includes non-typhoidal salmonella, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, and trachoma [10, 11]. To put this into perspective, 29 million people in Kenya are at risk for lymphatic filariasis, and two million are at risk for trachoma [11]. There are also infectious diseases that are specifically waterborne and foodborne that occur in Kenya due to population displacement, crowding, poor access to safe water and sanitation, and unsafe food handling and preparation (e.g. unpasteurized milk) [12]. These diseases include cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and E, Entamoeba histolytica, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, and brucellosis [12]. Malaria is a priority vector-borne disease concern in Kenya, but there are also other vector-borne diseases dispersed throughout Kenya. These diseases often occur from standing water or unprotected water containers, overcrowding, inadequate shelter, and significant climatic and temperature variation [12]. This list of diseases in Kenya includes Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, plague, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, human African trypanosomiasis, relapsing fever, and Marburg hemorrhagic fever [12]. Finally, there are certain infectious diseases that occur specifically from overcrowding\u2014hygiene and sanitation\u2014which frequently happen in refugee camps or slums. Diseases of overcrowding and subsequent inadequate shelter in Kenya include measles, ARI, diphtheria, meningococcal disease, pertussis, and TB [12].",

We were secretly led to a disco matanga located approximately 30 minutes deeper into the bush. At this point, we were approximately an hour away from Busia, Kenya, in a direction that crossed back and forth between the Kenyan and Ugandan border, but we would never be able to retrace the trail. The only light came from the motorcycle headlights in front of us and our only trail disappeared as soon as the dust settled. I had no idea what a disco matanga was, even up until the point where I exited the parked vehicle. I quickly learned. A disco matanga is a cultural funeral practice of the Luo in the Nyanza province [14].",

Disco funerals create an environment and provide opportunities for adolescents to engage in risky sex and promote HIV/STI transmission [17\u201320]. Wife inheritance also occurs at these events [21]; the purpose of a disco funeral was personally described to me as the combination of wife inheritance and a funeral into one event. Because the infection and mortality rate from AIDS is so high in the region, it has become custom that if a husband dies, the brother of the husband takes the wife as his own [21]. The culture in the region is accepting of polygamy, so having more than one wife or multiple relationships is condoned [20]; unfortunately, practicing polygamy in an area with significant rates of HIV/AIDS may be unsafe and may increase the risk of HIV transmission. For example, if the brother practices unsafe sexual intercourse with his newly inherited wife, who may have contracted HIV from her former husband, then he has an increased risk of contracting HIV.",

Community members attend because they are a cheap form of entertainment and an opportunity to meet the other sex; unfortunately, casual, forced, and transactional sex are often facilitated by the intense atmosphere at the funerals [20]. I experienced how and why these rapes may occur. The attending men are generally intoxicated, high from marijuana or miraa, and typically exude aggressive behavior. It was explained to me by the members of my group that children as young as 8 years old get raped at these events. Based on the parlous state of the environment, I was able to see how this situation could arise. According to current literature, a successful intervention addressing wife inheritance and disco funeral events, including the rapes, risky sexual behavior, and the spread of HIV/AIDS, does not exist [22, 23].

            "text": "It is unmistakable that infectious diseases and the surrounding environment perpetuate the disease lifecycle, as these attributes are current items highlighted by many international agendas. Thus, changes are taking place to address these concerns, although many of these diseases have been around for centuries and continue to have a stronghold in many populations. That said, it is also exciting to note the progress made in altering these disease rates. Here are some examples of some long-standing infectious diseases in the world, their origin, morbidity and mortality rates, and some current agendas aiding in their elimination strategies:Malaria is a vector-borne disease caused by parasites that pass onto humans through infected mosquitoes. There are 3.2 billion people living in 106 countries that have high risk to malaria exposure [29]. Symptoms of malaria range from flu-like illness to death; if not treated in 24 hours, malaria often progresses to severe and fatal illness [30]. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 212 million cases annually of malaria, resulting in 429,000 deaths [30]. Africa has the majority of the global burden of malaria, with 90% of cases occurring there, along with 92% of deaths due to malaria [30]. Malaria is preventable and curable; to date, efforts underway include many vector control interventions such as insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor spraying with insecticide, antimalarial drugs as prophylaxis, detection of insecticide and antimalarial drug resistance, surveillance efforts, and proper diagnosis and treatment [30]. Malaria has been eradicated from many countries, but the World Health Organization\u2019s goals are to reduce malaria incidence and mortality rates by 90% [30].HIV is a virus that is transmitted person to person through body fluids (e.g. blood). The virus attacks CD4 cells, which help maintain our immune system. HIV eventually destroys so many of these cells that the body cannot fight off other infections. Once opportunistic infections or cancers occur in this weakened immune system, the person develops AIDS [31]. Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, and 35 million have died from it [32]. Sub-Saharan Africa carries the burden of disease with nearly 70% of cases occurring there [32]. In 2015, there were 36.7 million people living with HIV; of this number, 2.1 were newly infected and 1.1 million died from AIDS [33]. But, progress has been made: HIV is no longer on the top ten causes of deaths in the world [4]. The primary way to reduce the spread of HIV is for infected individuals to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), which slows the progression of the disease and helps protect the immune system. Current prevention efforts besides ART availability and adherence include education, contraceptive dispersal (e.g. condoms), and HIV testing and counseling [34].Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top ten causes of death in the world [4]. The disease is caused by bacteria that generally attack the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body (e.g. kidney, spine, brain) [35, 36]. There are two types of conditions: latent TB and TB. It is only the development of the latter that can contribute to the contagious disease, as people with latent TB cannot spread the disease. TB is an ancient disease in which sanatoriums were historically used to quarantine infected individuals in hopes of halting the spread and curing the person [37]. The disease remains rampant, with 10.4 million cases and 1.8 million deaths, including being the leading cause of death for HIV-positive people [36]. More than 95% of TB occurs in low- and middle-income countries [36]. However, prevention efforts over the last couple decades have been effective and are believed to have saved approximately 49 million lives through diagnosis and treatment [36]. The BCG vaccine has helped prevent TB, though effectiveness is questionable [38]. If active drug susceptible TB is contracted, proper receipt and usage of antimicrobial medication typically cures the disease [36].\n",

Emerging infectious diseases are infectious diseases that are newly appearing or have existed, but are increasing geographically [40]. Population growth, urbanization and overcrowding in cities, unsanitary food preparation, ecological changes, and changing social behaviors are some direct factors contributing to the increased incidence rates of emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases [41]. These diseases happen in different origins. Some emerging infections are caused by microbes in nonhuman vertebrates, such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which originates in deer mice, and HIV and SARS, which are from primates [41]. Other diseases are re-emergent microbes were historically controlled in selected regions of the world. The dengue virus of 1903 was eliminated in Central and South America, but was located in Southeast Asia 50 years later as dengue hemorrhagic fever; however, because eradication programs had ended in Central and South America, the disease eventually became reintroduced [41]. Lastly, drug-resistant pathogens can also become threatening emerging infectious diseases. Chloroquine was effective in preventing malaria, but due to the resistance of the mosquito to the medication, malaria has resurged as a global threat [41]. Again, strategies for preventing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are collaborative efforts between state, local, government, academic, non-profit, and research agencies that improve surveillance and response, research, infrastructure, training, and control [42].",

Most measures seek to terminate the pathogen from the route of transmission or from its reservoir [1]. Moreover, instead of tackling individual diseases, infectious diseases can be grouped by environmental similarities, which allows for a more comprehensive approach to addressing problems. For example, instead of just tackling cholera, public health efforts can provide people with access to quality water, proper sanitation, and educational information on correct hygiene practices. These solutions can not only improve overall population health, but also eliminate the whole host of potential problems associated with not having these basic human rights.",

Alternatively, this same vaccine along with other preventative measures (e.g. hand washing) may be frequently used in typhoid endemic regions, such as India, or during typhoid outbreaks. Besides these types of specific program needs associated with individual countries, a comprehensive approach for infectious disease control would include:Water and sanitation. Pathogens can be easily transmitted in water. The World Health Organization recommends that each person have access to at least 15\u201320 liters of clean water a day [6]. Gastrointestinal pathogens are spread through feces, so proper sanitation is also necessary to avoid water-to-sewage contamination. Minimal sanitation facilities must include wash water, designated defecation areas, collection of sedimentation of sewage, and separated and properly disposed sludge [6, 7].Shelter and site planning. With appropriate shelters, diseases related to overcrowding can be avoided [6]. Additionally, these sites should have food safety programs that encourage standards, inspection plans, and regulations regarding food and milk preparation, handling, and distribution, which can help populations evade contaminated food diseases [7].Management of malnutrition. Malnourished individuals can have weakened immune systems and significantly suffer from bacterial infections that may have otherwise been cleared. Breastfeeding in babies should be encouraged to avoid diseases associated with food or water contamination [6]. Adequate nutrition should also be maintained in child and adult populations.Case management. Early and appropriate treatment ensures effective diagnoses and treatment of diseases and inhibits the spread of the disease [7].Surveillance warning and response systems. These early warning symptoms can promptly detect outbreaks and ensure rapid control. Effective procedures can include outbreak response, investigation kits and supplies, surveillance structures, laboratories for rapid diagnosis and confirmation of disease threats, and active communication response between key public health actors [6].Immunizations. Vaccinations are not only important for individual health, but public health as well [7]. A proportion of the population that is vaccinated ensures that a disease-causing pathogen will be unable to reproduce itself at high enough levels to maintain itself in the population [7]. Once the infected host is cured or dies, there will not be enough susceptible hosts to supplement the pathogens, thus eliminating further spread of the disease [7].Vector and animal control and personal protection. Both animals and vectors are carriers of many diseases that affect humans. Inspecting domestic animals can eliminate the threat of pathogens from milk or meat [7]. Vector-borne diseases can be controlled by eliminating breeding grounds or stagnant water in containers and by using pesticides and bed nets [6, 7].Health education. Education can help relay messages to the public in order to avoid infectious diseases. Some messages can include using safe water, avoiding mosquito bites, having safe sex or no sex, promoting proper hygiene, covering one\u2019s mouth when coughing, having good hygiene practices, eating safe food, and getting treatment early if necessary [6].\n",
