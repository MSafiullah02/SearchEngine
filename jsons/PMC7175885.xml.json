As of 7th April 2020, there are over 1.2million confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection1and 588 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in Beijing2. How to manage the vascular diseases properly and at the same time strictly prevent and control the pandemic represents a serious new challenge for vascular surgeons. The aim of this work is to assist our colleagues in the clinical practice during the coronavirus disease outbreak.",

Because most vascular diseases can be treated by open surgery or endovascular surgery, the latter usually has the characteristics of less surgical trauma, shorter surgery time, and shorter hospital stay. During the pandemic, when open surgery and endovascular surgery have similar effects, we choose endovascular surgery as much as possible. Only 4 of our 53 operations were open surgery (one abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm repair and three femoral artery thrombectomy), and the rest were all endovascular. During the surgery, we try to perform it through the femoral artery access, which can increase the distance between the surgeon and the patient's respiratory tract. In terms of anesthesia methods, our department prefers local anesthesia under the premise that patients can tolerate and cooperate, reducing the use of tracheal intubation to generate aerosols and increasing the risk of infection of anesthesiologists4. In the choice of intravenous access during surgery, we preferred dorsal vein or saphenous vein, avoid close contact with the nurse and the patient's respiratory tract. In these ways, we offered reasonable medical care for these critically patients during this crisis. None of the patients, medical staff and other contacts had infection during the treatment.",
