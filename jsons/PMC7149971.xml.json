Their failure took the form of responding too slowly, too inefficiently, and too ineffectively. When they did respond international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank, and United Nations (UN) failed in their communications among one another, a major cause for delay of effective action needed to contain the viral disease. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) clashed with the WHO and World Bank; the result was confusion about what was going on, what to do, or who was to do what. Multinational corporations initially contributed little of substance. Here, we describe the faults that caused such damage for the purpose of recommending steps to correct the errors and ensure that a catastrophe like this does not occur again.",

It\u2019s major malfunction in the Ebola epidemic was its failure to understand the public health disaster as it was unfolding and thus not acting early enough to limit the spread of Ebola virus infection. During the initial months of Ebola\u2019s debut, the WHO was slow in acknowledging that a unique infectious disease was advancing and killing people. Throughout this indolent period, Ebola continued to spread from Guinea across neighboring countries, primarily Sierra Leone and Liberia. With optimal public health control, the numbers of infections and deaths might have been 10-fold fewer or less, i.e., 28,000 to 2800 and 11,300 to 1300. Compared to the WHO\u2019s successes in handling prior epidemics of H1N1 and H5N1 influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the Ebola epidemic was largely ignored and handled poorly. The major cause of this failure by the WHO was likely its administration at that time. Neither their personnel nor that of the international disease control community was sufficiently decisive in understanding, acting, or supervising the outbreak. \u201cWe can mount a highly effective response to small and medium-size outbreaks, but when faced with an emergency of this scale, our current systems \u2013 national and international \u2013 simply have not coped,\u201d stated WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, Deputy Director-General Anarfi Asamoa-Baah, and the organization\u2019s regional directors in a joint statement on April 16, 2016.1 But, of course, the earlier an infection is contained, the less likely it will spread from a small to a large problem. The WHO admitted it was ill prepared. \u201cWe have taken serious note of the criticisms that the initial WHO response was slow and insufficient, we were not aggressive in alerting the world \u2026 we did not work effectively in coordination with other partners, there were shortcomings in risk communications and there was confusion of roles and responsibilities\u201d.2 In contrast, the WHO led by a different administration in 2002\u201304 acted forcefully and correctly when faced with the outbreak and possible pandemic effect of SARS.3\n",

Without protocols in place for identification of Ebola, the virus rapidly spread. The RT International report of November 23, 2015 stated, \u201cWithout any approved drugs, vaccines or rapid diagnostic tests, health workers struggled to diagnose patients and provide effective care.

Not until August 2014, a good 8 months after the initial Ebola cases emerged in Guinea, did the WHO begin to take action.

By comparison, in Boston, at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital\u2014part of Harvard\u2019s medical complex, more physicians worked on the second floor alone than in all of Liberia. Most of the healthcare staff in countries overrun with Ebola virus infections were not sufficiently trained to respond. They often lacked even the basic materials required for treatment and had insufficient knowledge or equipment to protect themselves from contamination. The exceptions in some areas included Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in Sierra Leone and centers where Doctors Without Borders were located. For example, Dr. Mariano Lugli, a deputy director of operations for Doctors Without Borders, did respond to an early incidence of Ebola virus infection. Working in remote forests of Guinea during March, 2014, when the outbreak spread to Guinea\u2019s capital, Conakry, Lugli set up a healthcare receiving and treatment clinic. Although Lugli was met by a foreign medic and logistician sent by the UN health agency, he never saw or met a WHO official who was responsible for handling this escalation of the outbreak. Lugli elaborates, \u201cIn all the meetings I attended, even in Conakry, I never saw a representative of the WHO. The coordination role the WHO should be playing, we just didn\u2019t see it. I didn\u2019t see it the first three weeks and we didn\u2019t see it afterwards.\u201d5\n",

Without leadership by the WHO in pursuing outside governments and philanthropies to establish isolation centers, surveillance, and laboratory capacity in West Africa, the local governments turned school classrooms into holding centers for those suspected of carrying the viral disease.

Dr. Korkor considered himself \u201creborn\u201d after surviving Ebola infection. The lack of doctors and trained medical workers in West Africa played a role in the spread of Ebola. Liberia has only one doctor for every 100,000 people, whereas Sierra Leone has two. In comparison, the United States has 245 doctors per 100,000 individuals. As hundreds of local doctors died in African communities, the Ebola outbreak escalated. Yet the WHO knew about the lack of health infrastructure in these countries, and one of their priorities should have been to plan support and enhancement of the healthcare network. Their responses should have been more vigorous.7\n",

A vivid example of poor management was the handling of early blood samples taken from infected patients to determine if they had Ebola. Some samples were shipped to laboratories where they were not examined immediately.

According to the WHO, one major obstacle was their concerns about political opposition from West African leaders. Many were cautious about taking aid because they mistrusted the source, a reflection of past exploitation by the West. The WHO, instead of working vigorously to resolve this difficulty, providing education, and reinforcing communication, became politically correct. When they should have announced that a major infectious outbreak from a deadly virus would hurt these countries\u2019 economies, the WHO did nothing to improve those relationships. Sensitive cultural differences made the WHO leery of disrupting any country\u2019s governance without a consensus. Unfortunately, regional culture most often trumps science and reason. The WHO bowed primarily to political pressure rather than health concerns. Critics have said, and we concur, that the WHO should have understood that traditional and natural practices in the region stood in the way of effective mechanisms to contain the virus, and the WHO had a moral obligation to act as educators, to organize teachers, and to share scientific knowledge of what the outcome would be not only to political leaders of government but most importantly to local tribal leaders.",

Certainly these and other currently operational institutions can and have played important roles in the past. The best argument for a new institution is to generate one with a single focus. The current global institutions have multiple responsibilities and priorities. Creating a solely \u201cnonpolitical\u201d and lean institution whose primary goal is for the prevention and recovery of global and natural health disasters would eliminate the lengthy and bloated bureaucratic process so that action would be taken quickly and efficiently.

Also, necessary medicines and medical equipment should be stocked, stored safely, and available. Funds for research and facilities should be pre-arranged. One would have to gather international support and trust in creating a new global institution for this goal.22 The need is to convince the world\u2019s sources of wealth to fund an enterprise that manages epidemic-specific activities and to allocate part of their GDP to this effort.

During the 2013\u201316 Ebola outbreak there was an enormous demand for doctors, nurses, and medical staff that was never met. Training in global health should be a component of infectious disease training not only in Ebola-susceptible countries but also in the medical schools and residencies of European, American, Canadian, South American, and Asian countries. The West African countries where Ebola infection prevailed still lack doctors. The dearth of basic equipment in Ebola-afflicted West Africa contributed to the large number of deaths and unsafe medical practices among healthcare workers. In addition, protective equipment\u2014uniforms, gloves, and headgear\u2014should always be available. Having trained individuals would speed up the control process and limit the spread of the infecting agent.

An enhanced medical team could have prevented escalation of the epidemic. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation suggests, \u201cWe need to invest in better disease-surveillance and laboratory-testing capacity, for normal situations and for epidemics. Routine surveillance systems should be designed in such a way that they can detect early signs of an outbreak beyond their sentinel sites and be quickly scaled up during epidemics\u2026and the data derived from such testing need to be made public immediately.
