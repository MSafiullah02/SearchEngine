On January 9, 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of this condition [1] . This virus was named by World Health Organization (WHO) as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it caused was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] . The outbreak rapidly became an epidemic across China over January. Consequently, COVID-19 was urgently classified as a Class B communicable disease and was managed as a Class A communicable disease in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Disease [3] . Various mitigation measures led to effective containment of the virus in early February, significant declines in infection in late February, and nationwide control by mid-March.",

Urban bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance passenger transportation in Wuhan were all suspended, and departure channels in airport and railway stations were also temporarily closed down [6] . Consequently, during January 23-31, population outflow from Wuhan declined to 6% of that in the same period in 2019, and travel intensity within Wuhan declined to 23% of that in the same period in 2019 [7] .

Cumulative frequencies for unconfirmed cases identified by clinical diagnosis and laboratory-confirmed infections diagnosed by positive nucleic acid test results were fitted, respectively ( Fig. 2(a) ). The number of overall infections, including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases, was summarized ( Fig. 2(a) ). The median proportion of unconfirmed cases was estimated as 40% of the total infections; the unconfirmed proportion was relatively high during the early phase of the epidemic in January (median, 55%; range, 42%-71%). When the trend of the epidemic in Wuhan up to February 14 was carried forward, the model predicted that the daily number of newly diagnosed cases would drop below 100 by March 25, and below 10 by April 29. In addition, the model predicted that the first day with 0 new cases would be expected by May 31, and that the number of overall infections (including laboratory-confirmed and unconfirmed cases) would eventually accumulate to 69 957 ( Fig. 2(a) ).",

Furthermore, a remarkable decline in daily new cases was observed beginning February 19, which aligned with the average expected incubation period of 5-7 d after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria. The dates on which daily new case counts fell below 100, fell below 10, and reached 0 in Wuhan were March 6, March 11, and March 18, respectively. These dates were 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than those predicted by Model I (Fig. 2(b) ). By March 30, the number of cumulative observed infections was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the number of cumulative infections predicted by Model I if the trend before February 14 were to be carried forward ( Fig. 2(b) ). Notably, the Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (trial sixth edition) released on February 19 no longer supported clinical diagnostic criteria for COVID-19. For a conservative estimation, the predicted number of unconfirmed cases after February 19 was subtracted from the overall number of infections; nonetheless, the actual situation in Wuhan remained optimistic compared with the predicted trend (Fig. 2(c) ). Transmission parameters after February 14 would be expected to differ, due to the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys in Wuhan, both of which were paired with the isolation of identified cases in order to control transmission sources and cut off transmission routes. Thus, the contact rate (\u03b2) after February 14 was re-estimated by partitioned fitting using MCMC (Model II). Sequential effective reproductive numbers R(t) were estimated by the outputs of Model I and Model II, and by actual frequencies with calibration for the frequencies before February 12 (Fig. 3) . R(t) demonstrated a steady downward trend since the first round of universal symptom survey during February 6-10, showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of the clinical diagnostic criteria during February 12-14, and closely approached 0 (< 0.1) after March 5. This curve aligned with the actual epidemic data for Wuhan. Fig. 3 . Sequential effective reproductive numbers (R(t)) for Wuhan's epidemic trend estimated based on dynamics models. R(t) curves were estimated based on Model I using actual data from before February 14 (red curve), Model II by refitting the trend after February 14 (blue curve), and calibrated actual frequencies (orange curve). Three vertical bars denote the three key intervention periods: first-round universal symptom survey, clinical diagnostic criteria, and second-round universal symptom survey.",

By the time of this publication, seven versions of the Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia had been released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. In early February, a large number of suspected cases emerged in Wuhan, which was beyond the capacity for nucleic acid testing. Before the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria, individuals with typical COVID-19 clinical symptoms but without the nucleic acid test, or with negative nucleic acid test results, were unable to be diagnosed and isolated in time to prevent potential transmission. Most suspected cases could be infectious, which increased the pressure on prevention and control efforts.",

At the same time, the hospitalization and isolation of these cumulative suspected cases over a brief period was equivalent to cutting off transmission routes, significantly curbing viral spread in Wuhan. Indeed, 5-7 d later, by February 19, the number of daily new cases and effective reproduction decreased dramatically. A second round of universal symptom survey over February 17-19 further consolidated the effects of the mitigation efforts. Collectively, the implementation of clinical diagnosis and universal symptom surveys in Wuhan in early-to-mid-February reduced the number of infections by nearly 20 000 and advanced two months of critical time points. It is notable that the actual data after February 19 deviated slightly from the epidemic pattern of infectious diseases as fitted by Model II, suggesting that some unconfirmed cases may exist.",

Second, asymptomatic infections and clinical classifications of the infections were not considered in this study. Third, a better estimation for the COVID-19 epidemic trend should rely on the data of the onset information of the infections, which was not publicly accessible. Fourth, potential confounders, such as further improvement of the reporting system and nucleic acid testing facility and capacity, were non-negligible during the causal inference based on observational data. In general, a set of measures, such as improvements of the reporting system and nucleic acid testing facility and capacity, aimed to increase the efficiency and sensitivity of identifying cases; these measures, if further improved after February 14, should have contributed to an increase in the number of daily new cases after February 14, which was not in line with the facts. On the other hand, such confounding effects may have resulted in an underestimate of the effect. In addition, the effect of the interventions was the product of mitigation strategies, and is thus difficult to decompose precisely.",

(a) The actual unconfirmed cases diagnosed by clinical symptoms (red dots) and laboratory-confirmed infections (gray stairs) before February 14, 2020 were used to fit the dynamics model. Orange stairs represent the actual overall infections including laboratoryconfirmed and clinical diagnosis cases after February 12, 2020. The numbers of cumulative unconfirmed cases (red curve), confirmed infections (blue curve), and overall infections including confirmed and unconfirmed cases (green curve) were predicted by the SEIR +Q dynamics model. Black arrows denote implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria from February 12 to 14 and universal symptom survey from February 17 to 19. The gray shadow before February 12 indicates the proportion of unreported unconfirmed cases. The gray shadow after February 14 indicates the effect of the interventions. (b) Summary of the effects of epidemic prevention and control interventions in Wuhan. Considering that the Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (trial sixth edition) released by February 19 no longer supported clinical diagnostic criteria for COVID-19, the predicted number of unconfirmed cases after February 19 was subtracted from the overall infections for sensitivity analysis (c).",
