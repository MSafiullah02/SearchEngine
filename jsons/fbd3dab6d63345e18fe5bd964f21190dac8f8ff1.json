Also, Chinese herbal medicines, which are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections, are being tested for their abilities to directly inhibit the SARS-CoV-2. The results show that of the large number of natural compounds that were screened, 13 were present in Chinese medicines. These were found to have potential for anti-2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) activity (2) .",

Next we exposed this mutant to10\u00b5g ml -1 of 5-FU and from their sensitivity to this concentration we concluded that they retained purine nucleoside phosphorylase and thymidine phosphorylase activities. These enzymes are found in human cells too, and a deficiency of purine nucleoside phosphorylase can cause lymphospecific toxicity (14) , a severe defect in T-cell immunity (15) , and disorder of the immune system leading to neurologic symptoms and autoimmune disorders (16) . Thymidine phosphorylase is also present in humans and its deficiency can lead to mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (17, 18) . Our next step was to expose the mutant E. coli produced above to a combination of 5-FU (2.5\u00b5g ml -1 ) plus deoxyadenosine (100\u00b5g ml -1 ). The culture was sensitive to this combination and we were able to isolate resistant colonies, likely to be mutants of either purine nucleoside phosphorylase or thymidine phosphorylase according to the reactions presented below. Analysis of resistant colonies showed that both class of mutants were present (19; 20) . Our attempts to isolate mutants of uridine phosphorylase were based on the same principle, except that instead of deoxyadenosine we used adenosine in the selective medium (21) .",

Soon after it started spreading quickly and reached other cities in China, Japan, and South Korea. As this paper goes to press there are more than 190 countries affected, and according to the World Health Organization it has reached pandemic stage. The previous epidemics of Coronavirus were Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.",

            "text": ", based on the high mortality rates induced by the two Coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, questioned whether the induced pro-inflammatory response plays a role in pathogenesis, and, if so, should inflammation induced by the infection be targeted to control the progression of the disease. It remains debatable whether drugs targeted to treat Coronaviruses infections may be enough to reverse the highly pathogenic infection, especially when certain anti-inflammatory drugs may have the ability to decrease the most important defence machinery against viruses, the immune system.Treatment proposed in this publicationMy search of PubMed (25 th March 2020) to find any research publications showing \"5-Fluorouracil and Covid-19\" has failed. However, a search \"Coronavirus and 5fluorouracil\" has identified 10 publications. The most recent in 2019 showed that 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has remained ineffective to treat any coronavirus infection. None of the other 9 papers (during 2016-1983) address the application of FU in the treatment with any concrete data. The reason proposed for the failure of 5-FU is that Coronaviruses have RNA proofreading activities involving a 3 ' \u21925 ' exoribonuclease within non-structural protein 14",
