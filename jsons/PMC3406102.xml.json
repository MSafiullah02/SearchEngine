Without treatment, at least 20% of patients will develop liver cirrhosis and of these, approximately 15% will progress to liver cancer within ten years [2]. HCV is the sole member of the genus Hepacivirus within the family of Flaviviridae. Its plus strand RNA genome encodes a polyprotein that is flanked by non-translated regions. Proteolytic processing releases ten viral proteins which coordinate viral RNA replication and particle assembly. The non-structural proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B in conjunction with cellular co-factors are both necessary and sufficient to catalyze genome replication [3]. Core protein, envelope protein 1 and 2 (E1, E2) reside in the very N-terminal portion of the viral polyprotein and compose the virus particle encasing the RNA genome. These proteins are essential for virus assembly. Interestingly, the ion channel protein p7, and the NS2 protease also contribute functions to the production of infectious viral progeny [4], [5].",

During virus production core protein resident on lipid droplets recruits viral proteins and RNA, which is an essential prerequisite for virus production [6]. In turn, core protein is loaded onto these cellular organelles through an interaction with diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT-1) [7], an enzyme which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of triglycerides that is essential for lipid droplet biogenesis [8]. In addition, host factors involved in the biosynthesis and secretion of human lipoproteins have emerged as essential cofactors for virus production. Specifically, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) were shown to contribute to virus production [9], [10], [11]. Likely as a consequence, infectious HCV is a \u201clipo-viro particle\u201d rich in cholesteryl esters and comprising viral proteins, ApoB and ApoE [12], [13].",

Using this approach we show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) regulated enzymatic activity of PLA2G4A is crucial for production of infectious HCV progeny highlighting the intricate involvement of host cell lipids and lipid-modifying enzymes in the replication of this virus.",

When transfecting our infectious firefly luciferase reporter virus genome Luc-Jc1 [14] into highly permissive Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cells [15] cultured in the presence or absence of serum, we measured comparable levels of luciferase activity 4 to 48 h after transfection (Figure S1A). Likewise, transduction of luciferase activity upon inoculation of na\u00efve cells with culture fluid from the transfected cells was similar (Figure S1B).

            "text": "To identify new host factors involved in HCV replication and/or virus production we used pathway-specific inhibitors of central signal transduction cascades including AKT/PKB, mTOR, Wnt, JNK and MAPK/ERK (Figure 1 and data not shown). To reveal rapid, signal-mediated changes of RNA replication and virus production we added the inhibitors 41 h post transfection during the logarithmic growth phase of cells. One hour later culture medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without inhibitors and virus production as well as RNA replication was assessed 6 h later. This procedure which is summarized in Figure 1A ensures that specifically infectivity of particles produced and released during inhibitor treatment \u2013 and thus blockade of the respective signaling cascade \u2013 is evaluated. Among the inhibitors tested, U0126 a selective inhibitor of the MAPK/ERK pathway, substantially decreased the production of infectious virus particles as is evident from the dose-dependent reduction of luciferase activity in the inoculated cells (Figure 1B). Interestingly, U0126 did not measurably impede RNA replication and only affected HCV particle production when added in serum-free medium. This latter finding may be related to a much more efficient blockade of the MAPK/ERK pathway in serum-free conditions compared to serum-containing medium that is evident from a lower level of phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 in the presence of the drug when serum was absent (Figure 1C). Collectively, these results suggested that the applied doses of U0126 efficiently prevented phosphorylation of ERK under serum-free conditions thus impeding production of infectious HCV progeny. Interestingly, PD98059 and Sorafenib which inhibit the MAPK/ERK pathway upstream of U0126 [16]\n[17] also reduced production of infectious HCV particles (Figure S2) further confirming the role of MAPK/ERK signaling in HCV morphogenesis. Notably, at least under serum free conditions, these inhibitors also reduced RNA replication. This may either be linked to a more potent suppression of MAPK/ERK signaling or due to inhibition of additional signaling events.",

Congruent to our findings with reporter viruses, treatment of cells with U0126 reduced both extracellular and intracellular levels of infectious HCV particles (Figure 1D). Although intracellular levels of core and NS5A were moderately reduced in the absence of serum (Figure 1E), addition of U0126 did not further reduce abundance of viral proteins suggesting that the inhibitor did not prevent RNA translation or RNA replication. We also tested if presence of U0126 interferes with HCV cell entry by adding the drug to infectious reporter virus particles that had been produced in the absence of the inhibitor (Figure S3). Since HCV infection was not decreased, we concluded that addition of U0126 does not prevent HCV cell entry but interferes with production of infectious progeny particles under serum-free conditions.",

Based on these criteria we focused on PLA2G4A, which is activated by MAPK/ERK-dependent phosphorylation [19] and recruited to the ER by Ca2+ ions [20], [21], as a possible candidate host factor that may be responsible for the observed U0126-dependent blockade of HCV particle production. In line with our finding that U0126 only inhibited HCV in the absence of serum, phosphorylation of PLA2G4A was selectively inhibited under these conditions and not affected when serum was present (Figure 2A).",

            "text": "To determine whether utilization of PLA2G4A activity is unique to HCV or common to other enveloped viruses, we analyzed production of infectious VSV and DENV in the presence of Py-2. In case of VSV, a member of the family Rhabdoviridae which assembles infectious virus particles at the plasma membrane [27], we used a replication competent reporter virus (designated VSV*MQ) that expresses a GFP transgene from an additional transcriptional unit placed between the G and L genes [28]. Interestingly, Py-2 treatment of VSV*MQ infected Huh-7.5 cells did neither affect intracellular level of GFP (Figure 3A) nor production of infectious VSV progeny particles (Figure 3B) indicating that unlike for HCV, production of infectious VSV particles did not rely on PLA2G4A activity. In contrast, production of infectious DENV, a relative of HCV from the genus Flavivirus that is thought to assemble at intracellular membranes [29], was heavily impaired by Py-2 treatment (Figure 3). Strikingly, like for HCV, RNA replication was not affected (Figure 3C) and release of particles was only moderately reduced as is evident from ca. 10-fold lower copy numbers of viral RNA in the culture fluid of Py-2 treated cells compared to mock treated DENV infected cells (Figure 3D). Importantly, when we quantified the infectivity of released particles using a limiting dilution assay we noted an approximately 1,000-folder lower infectivity titer for particles produced in the presence of Py-2 as compared to particles produced in the absence of the compound (Figure 3E). Since Py-2 did not grossly inhibit cell entry (Figure 3F) we concluded that inhibition of PLA2G4A activity via Py-2 primarily impairs infectivity of released particles (Figure 3E). In summary these results indicate that PLA2G4A is a key host enzyme required for efficient release and high infectivity of HCV and DENV, but not VSV particles.",

Under these conditions the reduction of PLA2G4A within cells should increase the susceptibility of HCV to treatment with Py-2 because due to lower abundance of the host factor a lower level of the drug should be sufficient to prevent HCV particle production. As expected, siRNA and Py-2 treatment did not decrease HCV RNA replication (Figure 4D and E). In fact RNA-replication moderately increased in cells that were treated this way compared to cells receiving a scrambled siRNA and no Py-2 (Figure 4E). Despite of this we found significantly lower levels of infectious virus particles secreted from cells receiving the PLA2G4A-specific siRNA and 5 or 10 \u00b5M Py-2 as compared to cells treated with the scrambled siRNA and these drug doses (Figure 4E). Collectively, these data indicate that siRNA treatment does not sufficiently suppress PLA2G4A enzyme activity to limit HCV production in Huh-7.5 cells. However, when adding the PLA2G4A-specific inhibitor to these cells, knock down of PLA2G4A increased the susceptibility to the drug, arguing that the abundance of enzymatically active PLA2G4A is important for production of infectious particles.",

These enzymes share the property of hydrolyzing the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to release free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Among PLA2-s only the PLA2G4A displays selectivity for cleaving phospholipids carrying AA at the sn-2 position [30], [31]. While local release of AA modifies membrane properties including curvature and fluidity [32], [33], [34], this lipid is also a precursor for production of bioactive prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotriens (LTs) which play essential roles in inflammatory reactions. In fact, production of PGs and LTs is reduced by ca. 90% in PLA2G4A deficient mice highlighting the dominant role of this phospholipase for generation of these lipid mediators [35], [36]. Given these circumstances we wanted to distinguish if properties of the PLA2G4A-derived cleavage products (AA and/or lysophosphatidic acid) directly contribute to HCV particle production, or if these molecules may indirectly promote virus production through activating inflammatory reactions. Since AA is further metabolized by lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases to yield prostaglandins and leukotrienes we assessed whether inhibition of AA metabolism by application of (S)-Flurbiprofen or Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid (NDGA), inhibitors of cyclooxgygenases and lipoxygenases, respectively, prevents efficient HCV particle production. However, neither drug modulated HCV RNA replication or decreased production of HCV particles (Figure S5). In fact high doses of (S)-Flurbiprofen even slightly increased levels of infectious HCV (Figure S5A). These results argue against the notion that AA metabolites and their biological activities are crucial for production of infectious HCV.",

Since both treatments are expected to increase availability of AA, these data suggesting that availability of AA may be sub-saturating in non-treated HCV transfected cells.

As the PLA2G4A-specific inhibitor Py-2 shares a heterocyclic ring with pyrrolidine we wanted to exclude that Py-2 may prevent virus production indirectly by inhibiting the viral protease or polymerase. Both enzymes contribute to active RNA replication complexes and may be required to feed in newly synthesized viral RNA into assembling virus particles. To address this, we treated Jc1-transfected cells with a polymerase inhibitor (2\u2032-C-methyladenosine; 2\u2032CMA), a protease inhibitor (boceprevir), with Py-2, or with quinidine, the latter being a class I antiarrhythmic drug recently found to inhibit production of infectious HCV [38]. As expected, only the RNA-replication inhibitors (2\u2032CMA and boceprevir) reduced abundance of HCV RNA in transfected cells (Figure S9A) dose dependently. While at the used doses (well beyond the IC90 for all compounds) all drugs moderately impaired release of HCV core protein (2\u20135-fold), only Py-2 and quinidine strongly reduced infectivity of particles (Figure S9C) to levels more than 20-fold lower compared to the DMSO control. Thus, it is unlikely that indirect effects of Py-2 on RNA-replication are responsible for the reduced amount of secreted particle and their impaired infectivity. Rather these findings argue that Py-2 directly interferes with HCV assembly and the infectivity of released particles.",

Since we were unable to detect endogenous PLA2G4A with commercial antibodies, we created a stable Huh-7.5 cell line ectopically expressing a GFP-tagged PLA2G4A protein. As is shown in Figure S10 we did not see gross changes of the distribution of these proteins during the short term Py-2 treatment. Moreover, localization of GFP-PLA2G4A did not differ between cells expressing HCV proteins and those cells that were not positive for HCV.

As expected, when the protease was added to cell lysates prepared by repetitive cycles of freeze together with detergent (Triton X-100), the viral protein was completely degraded (Figure 6A). However, when cell lysates were incubated with the protease in the absence of detergent, a substantial amount of core protein resisted digestion indicating protection by a membrane envelope.

Importantly, calreticulin and Golgi matrix protein were below the detection limit of our assay in the LD fraction whereas ADRP was readily detected thus confirming that our procedure successfully enriched cellular LDs. Notably, Py-2 moderately increased the total cellular level of core protein but at the same time reduced the abundance of core in the LD fraction of the cell lysate. This difference evident by western blot was further confirmed using a core-specific ELISA demonstrating a ca. 2-fold higher core protein amount in the lysate of Py-2-treated cells and about 3-fold lower levels in the LD fraction.

This approach enabled us to monitor co-precipitation of viral and host factors with an ApoE-specific or a virus envelope-specific antibody. Notably, treatment of transfected cells with Py-2 reduced the amount of secreted ApoE and core protein by ca. 25% and 65%, respectively (Figure 7B and 7C, respectively).

Remarkably, Py-2 treatment reduced the level of core protein co-precipitating with ApoE by 5-fold (Figure 7B). Likewise, inhibition of PLA2G4 lowered the association of ApoE and core with the FLAG-tagged E2 by ca. 5-fold (Figure 7C).

However, we note that in spite of clearly reduced abundance of the enzyme in siRNA-treated cells we measured only a small decline of PLA2G4A enzyme activity. It is possible that the active, phosphorylated PLA2G4A enzyme has a relatively long half-life which may preclude reduction of the active enzyme to a level that limits HCV infectious particle production under these experimental conditions.",

Importantly, among all PLA2 enzymes, only the PLA2G4A displays a preference for cleaving glycerophospholipids carrying the polyunsaturated AA at the sn2-position [24]. Moreover, related fatty acids including ETYA which differs from AA only by triple-bonded C-atoms in place of the double-bonded C-atoms in AA, were unable to restore virus production (Figure 5 and S7). Even 5\u20326-DHA (with a single triple-bonded C atom) only partially compensated production of infectious HCV in the presence of Py-2 indicating that highly specific properties of AA, the cleavage product of PLA2G4A, are crucial for production of infectious HCV progeny. AA is the precursor for biologically active lipid mediators including prostaglandins, thromboxane and leukotrienes collectively termed eicosanoids. These molecules are synthesized from AA through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways and play important roles during inflammation. However, since inhibitors of both pathways of AA metabolism did not impede production of infectious HCV particles (Figure S6), we believe that the properties of AA itself rather than indirect effects caused by AA-metabolites are important for HCV.",

            "text": "Our data support the conclusion that PLA2G4A activity is relevant for HCV assembly in two principal ways. First, inhibition of PLA2G4A decreased the amount of core protein associated with lipid droplets and reduced the level of core protein that is protected from proteolytic digestion (Figure 6). The latter finding may indicate a lower level of intracellular core protein that is encased in membranes \u2013 possibly within virus particles \u2013 and therefore protected from proteolysis. Moreover, we observed reduced levels of extracellular HCV particles (2\u20133-fold; Figure 7). It is currently unclear why inhibition of PLA2G4A reduces the level of core protein at LDs. In principal several mechanisms account for this including an increase of core assembly and subsequent unloading from LDs or a reduced trafficking of core to LDs possibly due to aberrant processing of the protein by signal peptide peptidase cleavage. However, since we observed lower levels of secreted virus particles we consider it unlikely that increased assembly and protein unloading from LDs is responsible. Moreover we did not detect an overt processing defect of core in the presence of Py-2 (Figure 2 and 6). Notably, Gubern et al. have shown that MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of PLA2G4A at Ser505 is necessary for biogenesis of lipid droplets [40], [41]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that blockade of PLA2G4A by Py-2 reduces lipid droplet biogenesis, thus limiting abundance of core protein at these organelles which are essential for HCV particle production [6]. Assuming that core protein has to be unloaded from LDs to drive budding and virus production which is consistent with the recent findings of Counihan et al. [42], it is reasonable to suggest that reduced core protein levels at LDs may decrease membrane envelopment and particle release. While AA (the product of the PLA2G4A-catalzed triglyceride cleavage) is apparently not required for lipid droplet biogenesis [40], it nevertheless seems to be essential for the second prominent influence of PLA2G4A on HCV, i.e. the production of highly infectious HCV progeny. Remarkably, both HCV and DENV produced and released in the presence of Py-2 were approximately 100-fold less infectious as compared to viruses assembled in the absence of the drug (Figures 2 and 3). Since addition of Py-2 to particles generated in the absence of the drug, did not impede cell entry (data not shown and Figure 3), we exclude that Py-2 interferes with cell entry of HCV or DENV. Rather, our results indicate that particle properties are altered when Py-2 is present. While the density spectrum of released HCV particles was unchanged, co-precipitation with ApoE- or envelope-specific antibodies provide firm evidence that blockade of PLA2G4A disturbs the composition/structure of released HCV particles. Specifically, we noted 5-fold reduced levels of core co-precipitating with anti-ApoE and likewise 5-fold lower amounts of ApoE and core co-precipitating with the envelope protein-specific pull down. These results argue that either less particles are directly associated with ApoE or that particles contain lower levels of ApoE. Since ApoE is important for infectivity of HCV particles [43], [44], a defect in the loading of this protein onto HCV particles may explain their reduced infectivity. In the envelope-specific pull down mediated by the FLAG-tagged viral E2 protein, we observed both 5-fold lower ApoE and also core protein. On one hand this may indicate lower abundance of both proteins in secreted enveloped HCV particles. On the other hand, this may reflect incorporation of lower numbers of glycoprotein complexes into the viral envelope and in turn reduced precipitation efficiency. Unfortunately, due to insufficient sensitivity of currently available envelope protein detection systems, we are currently unable to distinguish between these two possibilities. Nevertheless, these results argue that blockade of PLA2G4A by Py-2 prevents normal loading of viral (core and envelope proteins E1 E2) and host proteins (ApoE) onto nascent HCV particles. As a consequence, virus attachment or the interaction with entry factors or membrane fusion might be inefficient. Notably, recent evidence suggests that AA and other poly-unsaturated fatty acids increase membrane fluidity [32], [33], [34]. Thus, PLA2G4A activity in the vicinity of particle production may modify membrane characteristics including curvature and fluidity. These altered properties may disturb virus budding and/or the trafficking of viral and host-derived components to the site of virus assembly and thus result in the production of particles with disturbed stoichiometry, aberrant envelope composition, and poor infectivity. A more detailed proteomic and lipidomic comparison between particles produced in the presence or absence of Py-2 should help to clarify this in the future.",

It remains to be shown how exactly PLA2G4A contributes to production and release of infectious DENV particles. While it has been reported that DENV may also usurp LDs for its assembly [45], Welsch and colleagues showed that DENV assembly sites are physically linked to RNA replication sites on modified ER structures [29]. Unlike for HCV, AA did not consistently restore virus production of DENV supporting the notion that PLA2G4A may participate in HCV and DENV morphogenesis through different mechanisms. More work will be needed to fully understand the role of this host factor for these two viruses. Along these lines it will be interesting to analyze if other enveloped viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses) that like HCV and DENV assemble progeny particles at intracellular membranes depend on PLA2G4A as well. Such studies could in the future reveal common replication mechanisms between HCV and DENV (and possibly other viruses) that may provide valuable insights into conserved assembly pathways of enveloped viruses. Finally, inhibitors of the PLA2G4A which have been pursued and brought into clinical development for treating inflammatory diseases may prove useful as antiviral therapeutics for the treatment of chronic HCV infection and possibly other viral diseases.",

(D and E) Huh-7.5 cells were transfected with PLA2G4A-specific or scrambled siRNAs. 96 h later, cells were infected with Luc-Jc1 particles and subjected to the inhibitor assay outlined in Figure 1A. (D) Knock down of PLA2G4A was monitored by Western blotting. (E) HCV RNA replication was measured in cell lysates (top panel) and release of infectious particles was determined by inoculation of na\u00efve Huh-7.5 cells (bottom panel) and luciferase assays. The box plots in panels (B) and (E) as well as in the following figures visualize the full distribution of the data; the central horizontal line in each box indicates the value of the median, whereas the box represents the range between the lower and upper quartile of the data, i.e. the area in which the central 50% of the measurements lie. The whiskers extend from the quartiles to the minimum and maximum measurements, respectively.
