A 65-year-old man with absence of urine for 3 days; he was diagnosed with AKI stage 3, lung infection, atelectasis, electrolyte disorders, and coagulopathy, and the CRRT was initiated. On the fifth day, the patient was performed with endotracheal intubation and ventilator-assisted mechanical ventilation due to dyspnea and hypoxemia. A dynamic renal scintigraphy of 99mTc-DTPA was performed by PICC in this critical patient with AKI and artificially assisted ventilation. The relative renal uptake of the right kidney was 22,737 counts, the left kidney was 40,310 counts, the right kidney GFR was 14.6 mL/min, and the left kidney GFR was 25.9 mL/min. The bilateral renal blood flow significantly reduced and the renogram curves shown a renal failure pattern; the relative renal uptake of each kidney indicated the split renal function, respectively. These findings were most consistent with renal causes of acute renal failure",
