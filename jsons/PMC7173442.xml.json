Although the viral pathogens associated with the common cold may be detected by culture, antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction, or serologic methods, these studies are of little value unless treatment with an antiviral agent is contemplated.Treatment Specific antiviral therapy is generally not useful for the treatment of common cold illnesses. The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir (Chapter 368) have a modest effect on influenza virus infections, but the difficulty of distinguishing influenza from other common cold pathogens and the need to start treatment early in the illness for maximum benefit are practical limitations to the use of these agents for mild upper respiratory infections. Antibacterial therapy is of no benefit in the treatment of the common cold.Management of the common cold relies on symptomatic remedies. Treatments for nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and sore throat have demonstrated efficacy in adults but are not clearly beneficial in children and are not recommended for children younger than 4 years.Nasal CongestionBoth topical and oral adrenergic agents (Table 369-2\n) are effective nasal decongestants. Although direct comparison has not been performed in the common cold, it is generally accepted that topical agents, such as intranasal xylometazoline, are more effective than oral drugs for nasal congestion.1 Nevertheless, oral pseudoephedrine, 60 mg as a single dose or repeated for 3 to 5 days, is superior to placebo for relief of nasal congestion2, 3 and is safe. A 30-mg dose, however, may be no better than placebo.4 Prolonged use of the topical adrenergic agents should be avoided to prevent the development of an apparent rebound effect when the drug is discontinued. Systemic absorption of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline has rarely been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, and coma. The antihistamines have no effect on nasal congestion.RhinorrheaThe treatment of rhinorrhea is primarily by blockade of cholinergic stimulation of glandular secretion. Intranasal ipratropium bromide reduces rhinorrhea in colds by 22 to 31% compared with placebo, and it can be used as a combined spray with xylometazoline to relieve both rhinorrhea and nasal congestion.1 The most common side effects of intranasal ipratropium are nasal irritation and bleeding.The first-generation (sedating) antihistamines reduce rhinorrhea by approximately 25% compared with placebo. The second-generation or \u201cnonsedating\u201d antihistamines have had no effect on common cold symptoms5 in a limited number of studies. These observations, the absence of histamine in the secretions of most subjects with colds, and the similarity of the response to ipratropium and first-generation antihistamines suggest that any effect of antihistamines on rhinorrhea is related to their anticholinergic rather than their antihistaminic properties. The major side effects associated with the use of the antihistamines are sedation and drying of the eyes, mouth, and nose.CoughCough during colds is produced by several different mechanisms, and treatment should be directed at the most likely underlying cause. If cough is caused by nasal obstruction or postnasal drip, it may respond to treatment with an antihistamine or antihistamine-decongestant combination. If a more persistent cough is the result of virus-induced reactive airway disease or viral infection of the lower airways, patients may benefit from bronchodilator therapy (Chapter 87). Cough that persists after the resolution of other cold symptoms or that persists in association with unremitting rhinorrhea may be due to sinusitis and may respond to antibiotic therapy (Chapter 434). Nonspecific cough suppression with codeine or dextromethorphan hydrobromide has not been demonstrated to be efficacious, and expectorants such as guaifenesin are not effective antitussive agents.Other RemediesMany patients have a variety of other symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are effective for headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain; however, they do not relieve nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough.6\nZinc, which is an inhibitor of rhinovirus 3C protease that is essential for virus replication, does not have a significant antiviral effect and has shown either no or relatively modest effects in reducing the severity of the common cold.7 This uncertain benefit must also be viewed in light of zinc's side effects; oral zinc lozenges may be associated with sore mouth and occasional nausea, whereas intranasal zinc may cause nasal irritation.Echinacea has not been shown to be beneficial in reducing symptoms of the common cold in several studies.8 Given the variation in echinacea products, however, it is possible that echinacea preparations with different phytochemical profiles might be helpful. The accumulating evidence, however, suggests that it is prudent to assume that echinacea has no beneficial effect until positive evidence of a treatment effect is produced.\n",
