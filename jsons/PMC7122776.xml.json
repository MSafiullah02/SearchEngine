The incidence is age related, peaking over 65 years. Up to 75 % of CAP patients with pulmonary diseases need hospitalization, and up to a 10 % of these are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to complications like sepsis, septic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1\u20133]. Up to 8 % of CAP patients die within 90 days of disease onset; 21 % die within a year [4] making CAP the most frequent cause of death from infection in Europe and the third most common cause of death in general [5]. Mortality is highest in ICU patients.",

Additionally, blood culture testing is recommended in all patients with severe CAP, showing cavitary infiltrates, leukopenia (decreased numbers of leukocytes), alcohol abuse, chronic severe liver disease, or asplenia (disturbed spleen function). Bronchoalveolar lavage to obtain fluid from a small part of the lung via bronchoscopy is suitable for patients with life-threatening CAP or worsening pneumonia despite antimicrobial therapy. Urinary antigen determination may detect Legionella pneumophila and S. pneumoniae. Serum biomarkers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) may be used as indicators of bacterial infection [11\u201313].",

            "text": "Most CAPs are bacterial in origin and often follow brief viral upper respiratory tract infection. There are two main mechanisms to acquire pneumonia. Firstly, inhalation causes pneumonia due to microorganisms that can remain suspended in air and evade local host defenses. In addition, aerosolization is the route of infection by intracellular bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila spp., Coxiella burnetii, and Legionella pneumophila [6, 8, 9]. Secondly, aspiration of oropharyngeal flora can cause CAP. The ability of virulent bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to colonize the oropharynx is determined by the interaction of specific microbial adhesins with cellular receptors. For example, components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as fibronectin in oral mucus promote the adherence of viridans streptococci. In contrast, salivary fibronectin prevents colonization by Gram-negative bacilli, and decreased levels of fibronectin due to alcoholism, diabetes, malnutrition, and other severe comorbidities might contribute to an increased CAP risk. The presence of local immunoglobulins, particularly immunoglobulin A (IgA), complement, and normal flora also prevents colonization of the oropharynx by virulent organisms [6, 8, 9].",

As a result, blood flow is redistributed from non-ventilated to ventilated alveolar units, thereby reducing intrapulmonary shunts. Inhaled low doses of NO thus improve arterial oxygenation allowing to gain time for the effect of antibiotics [24].",
