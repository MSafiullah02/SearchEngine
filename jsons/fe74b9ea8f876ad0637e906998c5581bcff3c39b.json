As 'diagnostic PCR', a set of consensus nested primers was selected from highly conserved stretches of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. As 'phylogeny' PCR, a fragment of the spike protein gene (S1) was amplified and the PCR products were directly sequenced. To study the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses from various outbreaks, studies of molecular epizootiology were performed in Sweden, a Nordic region, where the occurrence of natural cases of the disease is relatively low and the occasional use of live vaccine(s) is well recorded and monitored. The disease appeared in the region in 1994, associated with production problems among layers of various ages. During outbreaks in 1995 and 1997, both layers and broilers were affected. To reduce losses, a live attenuated vaccine has been applied since 1997. By examining 12 cases between 1994 and 1998, molecular epizootiology revealed that, before 1997, the viruses had gene sequences very similar to strains of the Massachusetts serotype. However, comparative sequence analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the identity was not 100% to any of the strains of this serotype that we analysed. A virus related to the Dutch-type strain, D274, was also identified on one farm. Surprisingly, from 1997, the year that vaccination commenced with a live Massachusetts serotype vaccine, the majority of viruses detected had S1 sequences identical to the live Massachusetts vaccine strain. This genetic relation to the vaccine virus was also confirmed by N gene sequence analysis.

IBV can cause persistent infections, so the type of co-existence in possibility (ii) could happen (Capua et al., 1999) . Having no previous data about the causative virus, the 'phylogeny' primers were chosen to work on a broad set of IBV genotypes, not only the Massachusetts type strains. It seems to be unlikely that some other genotype of IBV could have escaped detection. These findings are supported by the ELISA results because, after turning positive, no rising titres were revealed that would have also indicated the fact of superinfection. However, the obtained data emphasize very strongly the third scenario, the spread of the vaccine virus. The nucleotide sequences of the viruses SE/1097/97, SE/1096/97, SE/1120/97 and SE/50/98 and the vaccine strain were totally identical in a stretch of 840 S1 nucleotides, strong evidence that the five viruses are identical. One could still argue against this identity, considering that recombination is a characteristic feature of IBV (Jia et al., 1995; Kottier et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1997; Lee & Jackwood, 2000) . It may be that a virus obtains a block of heterologous sequences from another strain in its S1 region and that this can disturb the exact classification of the serotypes and/or the strains (Jia et al., 1995) . This could be an explanation; that the four viruses have another origin, but not vaccinal. However, if so, why did the four viruses 'pick up' exactly the same 840 nucleotide sequen-ces of the vaccine strain?
