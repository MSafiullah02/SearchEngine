            "text": "A novel coronavirus was first encountered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 when patients started to present with community acquired pneumonia. 1 As a result of global travel the virus was rapidly disseminated to all provinces of China and 25 countries in Asia-Pacific region, North America, Europe, and South America within one month of its discovery. 2 Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 3 The UK's emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic thereafter stems from protocols that were developed both during and after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003. However major differences exist between SARS and COVID-19 in that the former was considerably more dangerous with a cumulative fatality rate (CFR) of 11% compared to an estimated CFR for COVID-19 of <1%. 4, 5 Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) are prevalent in head and neck surgery and it is likely that practice will have to change as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic at least in the short term. On 27 March 2020 Public Health England published updated guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) suggesting the need to limit the use of fluid resistant surgical facemasks (FRSM) to non-AGP procedures and FFP2/FFP3 for AGPs. 6 Given that sources of PPE are variable and may remain so in the future we sought to review the literature to investigate whether any additional lessons could be transposed from either the SARS or early COVID-19 experience into head and neck surgery to aid healthcare workers in both the outpatient and operating theatre environments.",

The high-volume evacuator attachment produced a 93% reduction in the number of contaminated squares (chi squared significant at P < 0.05). In the only in-vivo study 30 subjects had half their mouths cleaned using an ultrasonic scaler as a control and the other half using high-volume suction. 9 Four culture plates were placed on the operator and patient with high-volume suction resulting in an 81% reduction in mean bacterial culture forming units (CFUs).",

Whilst intra-oral suction devices such as those employed in dental surgeries are not universally present within Topical PVP-I usage is well tolerated, inexpensive and, for a patient about to undergo a procedure, a one-off episode. However, healthcare workers may choose to adopt PVP-I use over a more regular and sustained period. Daily use of 5% PVP-I mouthwash over a sixmonth period does not appear to influence thyroid hormone levels (serum T3/T4 and free T4) and although a small increase in TSH levels may result the latter remains within the normal range. 20 In a study looking at the excretion of iodine in healthy subjects, average ingestion of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f majority of iodine being cleared by the kidneys. The WHO recommended daily allowance of iodine for an adult is 0\u00b715 mg. PVP-I 10% contains an equivalent of 11 mg/mL of iodine suggesting that with daily use 4 mg of iodine would be delivered per day to staff depending on the method of application. Since aerosolised secretions from the lower respiratory tract almost certainly also have a part to play in disease transmission such an approach clearly only forms one part of a strategy to reduce transmission as an adjunct to other elements of personal protective equipment. The suggestion that tempering Chlorhexidine rinses (47\u00baC vs 18\u00baC) may reduce bacterial aerosol contamination further is untried with viral load. 12 A recent systematic review and rapid review of surgical masks versus FFP3 masks found no statistical difference in effectiveness between the masks regarding influenza like viral infections. 22, 23 The filtration capacity of a standard surgical face mask is highly variable compared to an FFP2 or FFP3 mask. Oberg and co-workers concluded that none of the surgical masks tested in-vivo on 40 subjects exhibited adequate filter performance and facial fit characteristics to be considered respiratory protection devices. 24 The mean penetration by 0.8\u03bcm latex spheres was 37.89 (95% CI: 25.8% to 50.0%).",

The PVP-I 7% gargle/mouthwash was diluted 1:30 with water to a concentration of 0.23% (the recommended concentration for \"real-life\" use) and tested at room temperature under clean conditions [0.3 g/l bovine serum albumin (BSA), viruses only] and dirty conditions (3.0 g/l BSA + 3.0 ml/l erythrocytes) as an interfering substance for defined contact times (minimum 15 s). Rotavirus was tested without protein load. A \u2265 5 log10 (99.999%) decrease of bacteria and \u2265 4 log10 (99.99%) reduction in viral titre was used to represented effective bactericidal and virucidal activity respectively. The diluted PVP-I gargle/mouthwash showed effective bactericidal activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza virus A (H1N1) and rotavirus after 15 s of exposure.

            "text": "the hospital environment, most out-patients and all operating theatres have access to some sort of high-volume suction equipment. Suction units in dental surgeries operate with a compression unit of 50 litres/min at 5 bar and require a minimum of 250 litres of air per minute. Operating theatre suction typically produces flow rates of 50 litres / min at 675mmHg (0.89 bar) with the wall-mounted units housed in many out-patient consultation suites producing a flow rate of 30 litres/ minute at 650 mmHg (0.86 bar). Whilst the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f evidence base for effective aerosol reduction revolves around the dental literature transposition into the hospital setting seems justified even though there is a disparity regarding the flow efficiency of the units involved. Unlike the out-patient environment operating theatres most commonly utilise a conventional plenum-type ventilation system that operates under positive pressure. This allows 25 air changes of an non-recycled air flow supply with outflow to the atmosphere via overhead exhaust vents located in the adjoining scrub and anesthetic induction rooms. Nevertheless it would appear that routine the use of high-volume suction equipment would be an effective policy to evacuate generated airborne particulates and so reduce the number that reach the breathing space of clinicians. Such measures could easily be adopted in the clinic and operative settings for a variety of procedures (e.g. out-patient nasedoscopy, panendoscopy under general anaesthesia).Minimising, or at least reducing, viral titres in saliva and nasal mucous expectorated by COVID-19 patients should another avenue employed in the battle to reduce transmission of the disease. Doing so may well lessen the overall impact on the healthcare system by reducing cross-infection from patients to healthcare workers and vice versa. Whilst direct testing and demonstration of the virucidal activity of PVP against SARS-CoV-2 has not been documented the evidence in the literature shows that PVP-I is rapidly virucidal in vitro and reduces the coronavirus load in the oral cavity to help prevent MERS-CoV transmission.13",
