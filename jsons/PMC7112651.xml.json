            "text": "The intranasal route of administering substances is attracting a steadily increasing amount of attention. A simple search of the literature tells us that by now almost 13,000 scientific papers have been published where IN-administration of a large variety of substances was reported. The number of papers per year shows a continuing rise from a mere 12 in 1970 to more than 100 in 1980, to almost 200 in 1990 via more than 400 in 2000, up to more than 1600 in the most recent years. The main reason for the increasing popularity of IN-administration is based on its proven efficacy to deliver substances into the brain and the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). At least two aspects make this route of delivery of substances to the brain more and more interesting. First, as a way to circumvent the \u2018Blood-Brain-Barrier\u2019 (BBB), that prevents many substances (including proteins and neuropeptides) to access the extracellular fluid surrounding the neurons and glial cells of the brain. The BBB is formed by the endothelial layer of the cerebral blood vessels and protects the Central Nervous System (CNS). It is a dynamic interface with a range of interrelated functions, consisting of effective tight junctions, transendothelial transport systems and enzymes, together composing the physical, transport and enzymatic regulatory functions of the BBB. The BBB forms part of the \u2018neurovascular unit\u2019 comprising pericytes or vascular smooth muscle cells, glial cells (astrocytes) and neurons, together controlling the permeability of the BBB and local vascular blood flow (Abbott and Friedman, 2012, Banks, 2012, Berezowski et al., 2012, Daneman, 2012, Pardridge, 2005, Zlokovic, 2011). The BBB is not a closed barrier but its permeability is a regulated function and in addition some \u2018leakage\u2019 may occur via the circumventricular organs (Ermisch et al., 1985). However, the possibility to target the brain and its functions directly without the limitations posed by the BBB (see below), opens new perspectives for clinical treatment of pain, psychiatric symptoms, degenerative brain diseases as well as brain-tumors.",

            "text": "The second consideration to apply IN-administration of neuropeptides is the elongation of the half-life values and efficacy of the substances administered. Due to enzymatic degradation, the half-life time of oxytocin (OT) in the blood is only less than 2 min, while in the extracellular space of the brain and in the CSF this time amounts up to 28 min (Mens et al., 1983, Robinson, 1983, Robinson and Jones, 1982). Similar differences in half-life values have been observed for other substances, particularly neuropeptides like \u03b2-endorphin (Burbach et al., 1979, Burbach et al., 1984, Houghten et al., 1980), which makes intranasal administration of substances considerably more effective by keeping CNS-concentrations locally higher over a longer period of time.",

In addition, intranasal cooling can be used to induce brain hypothermia (Covaciu et al., 2011). Since all applied substances apparently induce different effects on (aspects of) brain functioning, we have to pay some attention to the mechanisms involved in brain delivery of substances via the intranasal route and to the specificity of targeting the brain along the available routes of access. For the present purpose, a short survey will suffice since numerous reviews have been considering specific aspects of IN-administration over the last few years (Banks, 2006, Bos et al., 2012, Carnes and Robinson, 2008, Charlton et al., 2008, Dale et al., 2002, Dhuria et al., 2009a, Dhuria et al., 2010, Domes et al., 2010, Graff and Pollack, 2005, Grassin-Delyle et al., 2012, Guindon et al., 2007, Illum, 2003, Illum, 2004, Jogani et al., 2008, Liu et al., 2012, Merkus and van den Berg, 2007, Meyer-Lindenberg, 2008, Mygind and Andersson, 2006, Pathan et al., 2009, Strachan, 2005, Striepens et al., 2011, Thorne et al., 1995, Van Ijzendoorn and Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2012, Viero et al., 2010).",

Apparently, transport occurs in both anterograde and retrograde directions, revealing all central olfactory connections (Paxinos, 2004, Shipley, 1985). These findings were confirmed in other species at the electronmicroscopical level in the rat (Baker and Spencer, 1986) as well as after gene transfer of a plant lectin as a transneuronal tracer in transgenic mice to target the olfactory system in order to study its connectivity (Horowitz et al., 1999). Anterograde labeling of the olfactory bulb was observed after all survival times studied starting with 1 day (Baker and Spencer, 1986, Shipley, 1985) but for transneuronal labeling longer survival times were necessary, up to 7 days (Shipley, 1985).",

            "text": "Viruses have been widely used as transneuronal neuroanatomical tracers and interestingly for our present purpose many of them appear to infect the CNS via olfactory and/or trigeminal connections arising in the olfactory mucosa. Early investigations showed that a variety of viruses like Borna disease virus (Morales et al., 1988, Shankar et al., 1992), mouse hepatitis virus (Barnett and Perlman, 1993, Barthold, 1988, Perlman et al., 1995), corona virus (Perlman et al., 1990) and mouse rabies virus (Lafay et al., 1991) enter the CNS along the olfactory pathways. Some recent additions are adenovirus type 1, flavivirus, lysosomal enzyme (Procario et al., 2012, Wolf et al., 2012, Yun et al., 2012), herpes simplex virus, entering also along the vomeronasal chemosensory system (Mori et al., 2005, Tomlinson and Esiri, 1983) and the human influenza virus (Majde et al., 2007). Apparently, viral organisms have virtually \u2018open\u2019 access to the CNS along the olfactory system and pathways and for that reason most of the recent research activities in this field are aiming at prevention by intranasal vaccination as well as at intranasal protection mechanisms (Detje et al., 2009, Kang et al., 2012, Kim et al., 2012b, Lillie et al., 2012, Raghuwanshi et al., 2012, Weaver et al., 2012). Many of the viruses mentioned use the intra-axonal transport mechanisms of the olfactory pathways to gain entrance to the CNS although some use the trigeminal fibers as well (Perlman et al., 1990) or may even show a specific preference for entering the CNS via the trigeminal system (Mori et al., 2005, Perlman et al., 1993).",

Firstly, dextran molecules applied intranasally were hardly detectable inside the olfactory axons despite extensive labeling of the connective tissue surrounding the nerve bundles (Jansson and Bjork, 2002). Secondly, because these transport mechanisms are too slow to explain the effects of IN-administration. Thirdly, because many different substances have been visualized after IN-administration and inside the CNS a specific correlation with the olfactory pathways has never been observed while the effects were not limited to olfactory effects. Finally, because IN-administration has been tested for many different substances and the observed effects were always specifically different in agreement with their physiological or endocrinological role suggested by other kinds of experiments. This variety of effects is hard to reconcile with the involvement of only a limited set of secondary or tertiary olfactory connections.",

Several of the venous vessels from the nasal cavity enter the cavernous sinus via the angularis oculi vein. The cavernous sinus is traversed by the internal carotid artery (human, rat) that splits into numerous small parallel vessels traversing the cavernous sinus in many other species (swine, sheep, camel, cat and dog) (Einer-Jensen and Larsen, 2000b, Skipor et al., 2003). Thus, following the \u2018counter-current-principle\u2019, carotid arterial blood can be cooled here to keep the brain temperature below deep body temperature during heavy exercise (for \u2018hunting\u2019 or \u2018being hunted\u2019) (Baker, 1982, Baker, 1995, Einer-Jensen and Larsen, 2000b, Skipor et al., 2003). Surprisingly, however, in addition to these temperature effects, chemical exchange between venous and arterial vessels appears to occur as well. Substances like neuropeptides, progesterone, tritiated water, tyrosine, propanol and diazepam are transferred from the nasal cavity into these cranial arteries, sprouting from the internal carotid artery. As a result of this local exchange, the levels of these substances may be considerably higher in the brain vasculature than elsewhere in the peripheral circulation (Einer-Jensen and Larsen, 2000a, Einer-Jensen and Larsen, 2000b, Grzegorzewski et al., 1995, Krzymowski, 1992, Skipor et al., 1997, Skipor et al., 2003, Skipor et al., 2004). Other substances, however, failed to be transported along this route, like cocaine and the antimigraine agents sumatriptan and naratriptan (Einer-Jensen and Larsen, 2000a, Einer-Jensen et al., 2001).",

After careful evaluation of blood and CSF-levels of physicochemical factors and specific transport mechanisms, all recent reviews and reports reject the possibility that nasal delivery to the brain occurs only via the systemic circulation (Charlton et al., 2007b, Charlton et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2008, Costantino et al., 2007, Pathan et al., 2009) but there are some additional considerations. The OT-levels in the CSF are for only 0.01% (Mens et al., 1983) derived from the OT-levels in the peripheral blood, which fact virtually excludes the possibility that IN-OT is effective along the peripheral route. There is anatomical evidence that intact olfactory and/or trigeminal nerves are necessary to obtain the effects after IN-administration (Johnson et al., 2010, Thorne et al., 2004). The fact that all IN-administered substances, that can be visualized, always seem to enter the cranial cavity via and along the olfactory bulb, with an occasional extra entrance site in the brainstem near the trigeminal system (see below), is hard to explain when all substances arrive and distribute themselves via the systemic circulation. These considerations make it highly improbable that \u2018nasal delivery\u2019, as a general rule, occurs via the general circulation but we have to keep in mind that under certain conditions and for certain substances, the systemic-route-contributions may play some role in the observed effects of IN-administration, especially if the substances easily cross the BBB.",

            "text": "Anatomical considerations: substances targeting the brain from the blood stream have specific access to the BBB-lacking \u2018circumventricular organs\u2019 (CVO's). These are small neurohaemal structures with numerous fenestrated capillaries, loosely apposed astrocytes and large perivascular spaces. They are functionally subdivided in sensory and secretory CVO's and involved in a variety of neuroendocrine and pathological functions including the production of neural stem cells (Benarroch, 2011, Bennett et al., 2009, Fry and Ferguson, 2007, Horsburgh and Massoud, 2012, McKinley et al., 2003, Siso et al., 2010). Their borderline towards the CSF is closed, however, by the tight junctions between the ependymal cells lining the ventricles (Suarez et al., 2010). The CVO's are monitoring the composition of the peripheral blood and provide access to numerous brain areas since they are extensively interconnected as well as reciprocally connected with hypothalamic and other brain areas involved in homeostatic functions (Benarroch, 2011, Suarez et al., 2010). But these \u2018entrance-portals\u2019 for humoral information have specific neuronal connections (Benarroch, 2011, Larsen and Mikkelsen, 1995, Larsen et al., 1991, Suarez et al., 2010) and the brain distribution of substances using them is radically different from what happens after IN-administration. In the latter case, whenever substances could be visualized, they entered the cranial cavity in its rostral, olfactory part, and encompassed more caudal brain regions with some delay and with steadily decreasing concentrations, most probably involving the CSF in the subarachnoid space (Charlton et al., 2008, Hashizume et al., 2008, Pathan et al., 2009, Thorne et al., 2004). Interestingly, several substances showed a second \u2018entrance\u2019 at the brainstem level, via peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve innervating the nasal walls (Charlton et al., 2008, Hashizume et al., 2008, Pathan et al., 2009, Thorne et al., 2004). The specificity of these \u2018entrance-sites\u2019 is hard to reconcile with a systemic distribution of substances crossing the BBB via the CVO's.",

Walter et al. (2006b) described in detail a putative model of labyrinthine channels, surrounding the olfactory fibers during their passage of the cribriform plate providing the CSF with a route for draining into the lymphatic system with the possible side-effect of stimulating antibody-production in the cervical lymph nodes (Walter et al., 2006a). Nerve-associated lymphatic vessels have been described, connecting lymphatic vessels in the dura mater on the cribriform plate, via the epineurium and close to the perineural sheath of the olfactory fibers downward into the nasal mucosa (Furukawa et al., 2008). These vessels seem to be present along all cranial nerves and may not only contribute to transport CSF, tissue fluid and free cells but provide also a morphological basis for routes of immune cell transfer and tumor metastasis (Furukawa et al., 2008). Anatomical investigations did not provide support for the possibility that these CSF-nose lymphatic connections are also used in the contrary direction (Jansson and Bjork, 2002, Sakane et al., 1995).",

Since there are about 1800 glomeruli in the mouse olfactory bulb (Rogers and Firestein, 2001) the continuous guidance of the new outgrowing OSN-axons via the proper fascicles (Nedelec et al., 2005) requires a complex control mechanism. Olfactory ensheating cells and olfactory nerve fibroblasts play a primary role (Field et al., 2003) and these cells maintain continuous open channels for regrowth of olfactory nerve fibers (Li et al., 2005a). Erythrocytes have been observed to traverse such channels all the way between the olfactory bulb and the mucosal lamina propria (Li et al., 2005a). A microscopical study applying IN-dextran molecules in the rat (Jansson and Bjork, 2002) showed clearly the transcellular uptake of the molecules through the epithelium followed by a fast transfer directly to the olfactory bulb via the connective tissue surrounding the nerve bundles. Within 2 min the dextran arrived at the olfactory bulb itself! These data fully supported the earlier findings of Sakane (Sakane et al., 1995). Paracellular uptake was not observed and considered unlikely. Intra-axonal transport of dextran was not observed either but some staining was observed in the Bowman ducts and glands. In the lymphoid tissue, underlying the epithelial layer, no staining could be detected (Jansson and Bjork, 2002).",

In later years the effects of IN-OT on obsessive-compulsive disorder (Ansseau et al., 1987, den Boer and Westenberg, 1992, Epperson et al., 1996), on post-traumatic stress symptoms (Haagsma et al., 2012, Olff, 2012, Pitman et al., 1993), on ejaculation latency (Burri et al., 2008, Ishak et al., 2008, Walch et al., 2001), on a sexually dimorphic spinal motor system (Lenz and Sengelaub, 2010) and possibly on obesity (Maejima et al., 2011) were studied as well.

Its production occurs in the CNS in neurons mostly located in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) hypothalamic nuclei, with some additional perivascular clusters in between. Inside the PVN, magnocellular and parvocellular subregions can be discerned containing different types of oxytocinergic neurons (Armstrong and Hatton, 2006, Armstrong et al., 1980, Armstrong et al., 2010, Buijs, 1978, Buijs, 1990, Buijs et al., 1983, Carroll et al., 1968, Crowley and Armstrong, 1992, Sawchenko and Swanson, 1982, Sawchenko et al., 1984, Simmons and Swanson, 2009, Swanson and Claycomb, 1969, Swanson and McKellar, 1979). Concerning the effects of OT on peripheral organs as well as on the CNS, three different mechanisms have been described.",

            "text": "(1) The axons of the magnocellular neurons traverse the median eminence towards the posterior pituitary, where the terminals release their OT-contents directly into the peripheral blood circulation. This humoral mechanism may influence all receptive peripheral organs as well as all receptive parts of the CNS outside the BBB. More recent information has shown, however, that the magnocellular SON projects to a number of extrahypothalamic sites as well (Alonso et al., 1986) and that the magnocellular part of the PVN projects into the nucleus accumbens and other brain areas as well, using long varicose fibers (Ross et al., 2009a, Ross et al., 2009b, Ross and Young, 2009). (2) The parvocellular oxytocinergic neurons, especially those in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), do not participate in this peripheral release but take care of (part of) the neuronal connections of the PVN with several other parts of the CNS, including descending projections to the lower brainstem and all levels of the spinal cord in rat (Buijs, 1978, Buijs et al., 1983, Sawchenko et al., 1984, Simmons and Swanson, 2009, Swanson and McKellar, 1979) and mouse (Biag et al., 2012). This neuronal mechanism allows fast and specific messages towards circumscribed target-regions of the CNS. (3) Other neural release mechanisms are attracting attention since about a decade in addition to the \u2018regular\u2019 terminal and axonal release mechanism. Release of OT from soma and dendrites of neurons in the PVN and the SON has been studied in detail. Dendritic release of OT is regulated by specific mechanisms independently from the terminal (peripheral) release from SON (Landgraf and Neumann, 2004, Leng et al., 2008a, Leng and Ludwig, 2006, Ludwig, 1998, Ludwig and Leng, 2006, Waldherr and Neumann, 2007) and this dendritic release induces OT-release from neighboring dendrites as well, leading to a coordinated response of all OT-neurons in the activated nucleus (Moos and Richard, 1989, Morris and Ludwig, 2004, Yamashita et al., 1987). Additional excitatory mechanisms extend this activation to other hypothalamic OT neurons as well, bilaterally, most probably via a brainstem relay mechanism (Moos et al., 2004a, Moos et al., 2004b) providing the \u2018OT-system\u2019 with a powerful release mechanism with special importance for the peripartum period (Neumann et al., 1996, Neumann, 2003). These mechanisms are extremely powerful since most of the OT content of the magnocellular neurons is located in their dendrites (Leng et al., 2005, Ludwig and Leng, 2006). Due to this coordinated dendritic release the extracellular levels of OT inside the PVN and/or the SON may increase to a thousand fold! Large amounts of this extracellular OT will reach the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) either by intended release or by \u2018spilling over\u2019 of the huge ECF-concentrations alongside the CSF-compartment. The PVN borders the rostral tip of the third ventricle and its dendritically released OT may \u2018go with the flow\u2019 (Veening and Barendregt, 2010, Veening et al., 2010) of the CSF to arrive at caudal hypothalamic and brainstem destinations. The SON is located near the ventral surface of the hypothalamus and its contents may be released into the adjoining arachnoid space along the ventral surface of the brain.",

            "text": "Because transport via the ventricular CSF is relatively fast, it takes only 1 or 2 min from the lateral ventricles to reach the ventral medullar surface in rat or cat (Feldberg, 1976, Proescholdt et al., 2000) and because, as mentioned, half-life times in the CSF are considerably longer than in plasma (28 min versus 2 min!) and because numerous OT-receptive brain areas are bordering the ventricular system and arachnoid spaces (Campbell et al., 2009, Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001, Gimpl et al., 2008, Gould and Zingg, 2003, Schorscher-Petcu et al., 2009), we proposed that the CSF can be considered a \u2018message-carrier\u2019 for the endogenous OT-communication between PVN and SON and receptive target areas in the CNS (Veening and Barendregt, 2010, Veening et al., 2010). Such a diffuse way of brain communication has been coined \u2018Volume Transmission\u2019, different from the well-known \u2018wiring transmission\u2019 and it plays an important role in the communication in the extracellular space including the CSF (Agnati et al., 1994, Agnati et al., 1995, Agnati et al., 2010, Agnati and Fuxe, 2000, Fuxe et al., 2007, Fuxe et al., 2010, Zoli et al., 1999). Details about such a role have been worked out before (Sewards and Sewards, 2003a, Sewards and Sewards, 2003b) for the neuropeptides vasopressin and corticotrophin-releasing-factor and more recently for \u03b2-endorphin (Veening et al., 2012). Supporting evidence can be obtained from the numerous physiological and behavioural experiments with intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of OT showing that this route of administration generally requires much lower amounts of OT, while the effects were generally stronger and included effects that were not obtainable by peripheral administration (for a recent review: Veening et al., 2010). Neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, bordering the 3rd ventricle, were rapidly and strongly responsive to icv-administered OT (Leng et al., 2008b). Finally, it is good to keep in mind that CSF-levels of OT are different and independent and usually higher than plasma levels and that plasma-OT has virtually no access to the CSF-compartment because of the interposed blood-brain-barrier (BBB) (Amico et al., 1990, Ludwig and Leng, 2006, Mens et al., 1983).",

The second possibility has a neuronal character.

The third possible \u2018pathway\u2019 consists of the numerous perineuronal spaces and paravascular routes, described earlier, by which OT may reach the CSF-filled subarachnoid space mainly at the level of the olfactory bulb but possibly at a trigeminal-brainstem level as well.",

            "text": "Several peripheral organs like heart, kidney and uterus, are sensitive for circulating OT because of the presence of OT-receptors. The receptor density is variable and can be up regulated considerably (12-fold) in the uterus at the end of gravity (Fuchs et al., 1984). Basal OT-levels are low and usually remain below 10 pg/ml in rat (Higuchi et al., 1986), sheep (Dawood et al., 1983) and man (Burri et al., 2008, Landgraf, 1985). Despite the gradual rise in OT-levels during pregnancy (sheep, Dawood et al., 1983), OT does not seem to be involved in the onset of parturition itself, since the steepest rise occurs only after vaginal extension in the expulsive phase (Higuchi et al., 1986, Landgraf et al., 1983). In the rat, peripheral OT-levels rise abruptly and steeply when suckling and milk ejection starts, followed by a rapid decline afterwards, as could be expected from the short peripheral half-life time of OT, in the order of 1 or 2 min (Higuchi et al., 1986, Mens et al., 1983, Robinson, 1983, Robinson and Jones, 1982). After parturition, however, the peripheral OT-decline is much slower (Higuchi et al., 1986) suggesting that a decline of peripheral levels of OT is not merely a passive matter of removal or proteolysis of circulating OT but includes the involvement central regulating mechanisms controlling the duration of the elevated levels of peripheral OT. These findings suggest that the flat but clearly elevated plasma OT-levels, extending over a period of more than an hour as observed in human males after a single intranasal administration of 65\u2013100 \u03bcg OT (Burri et al., 2008, Landgraf, 1985), are most probably also the result of central mechanisms controlling the peripheral levels of OT. The observation that a 3\u20134 times lower dose of OT (25 \u03bcg) injected intramuscularly, results in 6\u201310 times higher peripheral levels whereas buccal administration was totally ineffective (Landgraf, 1985) supports the notion that the peripheral levels obtained after IN-OT are not simply reflecting its vascular uptake.",

The direct involvement of these brain areas in \u2018autonomic control\u2019 mechanisms implies that the effects of intranasally administered OT are by no means restricted to central effects but will result, \u2018indirectly\u2019 via these regulatory brain mechanisms, in a variety of peripheral effects as well. In that respect the peculiar findings obtained by the group of Nozdrachev (Kovalenko et al., 1995, Shtylik et al., 1995) need to be replicated. One of these articles in Russian reports in the English abstract: \u2018Following unilateral intranasal oxytocin administration, asymmetric alterations in some functional parameters of the adrenal glands, testis, lungs and heart, occurred. The lateralization of alterations was dependent on the side of oxytocin injection and the side of paired organ arrangement \u2026.\u2019 (Shtylik et al., 1995). If such or similar findings can be replicated it would be fully clear and convincing that peripheral effects of intranasal oxytocin can not be the result of direct venous or lymphatic drainage of the nasal mucosa into the blood stream, because after passage of the heart the contents of the bloodstream do not contain any lateralized information any more. So, for the moment, despite the fact that IN-OT is reflected in human saliva (Weisman et al., 2012) and the numerous peripheral effects of \u2018central OT\u2019 (Borrow and Cameron, 2012), we consider, for the present discussion, all peripheral IN-OT effects as secondary to the induced changes in brain activity that include autonomic and endocrine mechanisms, via neuronal connections descending deeply into brainstem and spinal cord, possibly via lateralized pathways. These \u2018central effects\u2019 of IN-OT will therefore be the focus of the present review.",

OT is a nonapeptide with a molecular weight of 1007.19 g/mol or 1007 Da. A comparison with data obtained from other neuropeptides shows that its size is in the favored range of up to about 1000 Da, allowing efficient absorption (Costantino et al., 2007, Fisher et al., 1987, McMartin et al., 1987). Apart from its molecular size, however, many other factors determine the amount of OT becoming available to the brain after IN-administration, like lipophilicity and biochemical stability.

            "text": "The time scale at which the IN-OT starts to affect brain activity and the local distribution over the brain after a few minutes, have not been investigated in detail so far. But in a recent dialysis study on rats and mice central OT levels were elevated after about 30 min (Neumann et al., 2013). Occasionally, in human studies, the behavioral effects of IN-OT were studied after about an hour (Burri et al., 2008). However, plasma levels of OT were elevated already within 20 min (Burri et al., 2008, Landgraf, 1985), whereas the central nervous effects of a neuropeptide of similar size (cholecystokinin, CCK-8, MW 1143) were most clearly obtained at 15\u201330 min after IN-administration (Pietrowsky et al., 2001). The finding that plasma OT-levels remain elevated for a long time (more than 80 min!) after a single intranasal administration (Burri et al., 2008, Landgraf, 1985) is rather surprising. In view of the short peripheral half-life values of OT, the sustained elevated levels can hardly be explained by continuous OT-uptake from the nasal membranes (Burri et al., 2008). Rather, they reflect a long-term peripheral release by activation of the OT neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei induced by the intranasal administration of OT. Projections arising in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb project directly to SON (Meddle et al., 2000, Smithson et al., 1989, Smithson et al., 1992) and may be involved in such elevated levels for a longer period of time. Brainstem projections as well as paracrine mechanisms coordinating a bilateral response from SON and PVN (Belin et al., 1984, Bodineau et al., 2011, Moos et al., 2004b, Moos and Richard, 1989, Rossoni et al., 2008) may suffice for an elongated peripheral OT-response. Further investigations are necessary and currently available techniques provide ample opportunities to tackle the open questions in this field.",

            "text": "The data obtained by (Charlton et al., 2008, Thorne et al., 2004), as discussed below, show that IN-administration of radically different neuroactive substances was leading to very comparable results concerning the time-range of brain effects, starting at 1 and peaking between 15\u201330 min, and there is no reason to expect that the neuropeptide OT is behaving very differently. However, concerning the IN-effects of OT, several special OT-related aspects have to be considered because they are \u2018OT-specific\u2019 and not occurring after IN-administration of other substances except vasopressin. The following aspects may affect both the immediate effects of OT and the surprisingly long-term effects of IN-OT administration.(1)The olfactory sensory neurons (OSN's) themselves are OT-receptive. OT exerts a massive stimulating effect on OSN's most probably via the V1a AVP receptor (Levasseur et al., 2004). Therefore, we assume that activity in the olfactory system will be increased immediately after IN-administration of OT starting in both main and the accessory olfactory bulbs.(2)Given the favorable size of the OT molecule, its arrival at/around the olfactory bulb via the \u2018direct pathways\u2019 can be expected within a minute or two and this \u2018activation wave\u2019 would arrive at a perfect moment to increase and prolong the earlier, OSN-induced olfactory effects.(3)OT molecules in the CSF surrounding the olfactory bulbs have \u2018free access\u2019 to the superficial and deeper layers of the bulbs because the CSF and the extracellular compartment of the brain are in open communication (Milhorat, 1975). While the BBB is virtually closed for OT (Mens et al., 1983), CSF-OT has free access to the bulbar extracellular space by diffusion or via paravascular spaces and possibly CSF-contacting neurons (see reviews by Veening and Barendregt, 2010, Veening et al., 2010). Therefore, OT arriving in the CSF surrounding the olfactory bulbs will contribute to their coordinated direct and indirect activation.(4)Projections from the mitral cells of the main and accessory olfactory bulb reach the (dendrites of the) OT-neurons in the SON directly (Meddle et al., 2000, Smithson et al., 1989, Smithson et al., 1992) in addition to the many possible indirect effects via the medial amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis or the medial preoptic areas.(5)Along the projections mentioned, olfactory stimulation induces activation of OT-neurons in the SON and these neurons may activate a larger population of OT-neurons in the SON via dendritic release mechanisms (Ludwig, 1998, Ludwig and Leng, 2006) or via the lower brainstem (Belin and Moos, 1986, Moos et al., 2004a, Moos et al., 2004b) to include the contralateral SON and the PVN-OT-neurons as well (for a recent review: Veening et al., 2010).(6)Interestingly, electrical stimulation of the PVN, elevating OT-levels in the CSF (Jones et al., 1983), as well as icv administration of OT have inhibitory effects on olfactory processing in the mitral cells of the bulb (Yu et al., 1996a, Yu et al., 1996b). This inhibitory effect appears to be necessary for the behavioral switch occurring at the rapid onset of maternal behavior after parturition.(7)OT, after arriving in the CSF around the olfactory bulb, will start spreading caudally via the CSF to \u2018cover\u2019 more caudal parts of the brain, as described for other substances (Charlton et al., 2008, Dhuria et al., 2010, Lochhead and Thorne, 2012, Thorne et al., 2008, Thorne et al., 2004) implying that cortical and other OT-receptive areas will be affected at a later stage than the olfactory regions and by steadily decreasing gradients in OT-levels from rostral to caudal brain areas. Concentrations at the level of the cerebellum may still be considerable, however, as shown for the angiotensin-antagonist GR138950, where \u2018cerebellar levels\u2019 clearly surpassed the levels obtained after intravenous administration (Charlton et al., 2008).\n",

IGF-I is different from OT, as IGF-I is passing the BBB much easier. However, highest peaks in the blood were reached about 6 h after intranasal administration, while highest brain levels were obtained within 30 min. In addition, consequences of intranasal administration were completely different from intravenous administration effects and the brain levels measured after IN-administration were about 100 times higher than after i.v. administration, virtually excluding the possibility that brain effects were secondary to peripheral effects (Thorne et al., 2004). In their study a number of surprising, illuminating as well as puzzling findings were reported. Among them:-Entrance of the cranial cavity occurred along two different cranial nerves: the olfactory nerve, innervating the olfactory part of the nasal cavity and the trigeminal nerve innervating also the respiratory part of the nasal epithelium.-The olfactory entrance is the main route for the forebrain effects and the trigeminal entrance is mostly responsible for the brainstem and cerebellar effects.-The levels of IGF-I in the CSF remained surprisingly low, at least at the level of the cisterna magna, but peak levels consistently preceded those in the bloodstream.-Of the brain regions sampled, highest concentrations of radioactive IGF-I were observed in specific rostral brain regions (olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, frontal pole and motor cortex), in the trigeminal nerve and in areas just below where the trigeminal nerve enters the brainstem (medulla and cervical spinal cord), with levels decreasing in the caudal direction from the olfactory bulb and in both directions from the caudal brainstem.\n",

(2008) showed that elevated levels of GR138950, an angiotensin antagonist (MW 611) with low BBB permeability, were present within a minute after IN-administration in the olfactory bulbs as well as in the surrounding CSF. More posterior cerebral parts of the brain showed elevated levels progressively later after 5 or 10 min, while in the cerebellar tissue highest levels were reached after about 30 min. Apparently, the spreading of the intranasally applied substance occurred in a rostral to caudal direction and from the autoradiographs of the tissue sections authors concluded that the CSF in between and surrounding the olfactory bulbs, the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum was mainly responsible for this distribution pattern because increased CSF levels tended to precede the elevated brain tissue levels (Charlton et al., 2008). Their study provided no indications for possible other \u2018entrance-points\u2019, like the trigeminal system, from where spreading might have occurred or for the possible involvement of the intraventricular CSF. The CSF is flowing rapidly in a caudal direction and probably contains messages for distant brain areas (Veening and Barendregt, 2010).",

The last, peripheral, effect probably bears no relationship any more with the tiny amount of OT delivered to the nasal epithelium but seems to be fully resulting from activated internal OT-control mechanisms. The occurrence of such a variety of successive \u2018internal\u2019 effects involving probably all brain circuits in which OT usually operates, implies that CSF- and peripheral levels of OT hardly reflect what is really \u2018going on\u2019 after IN-administration and that the evidence obtained by measuring them can be, at the most, circumstantial.

Similar effects were observed in a recent study by Gossen et al. (2012). Such long-term elevations do not occur in CSF-levels after an orgasm at least not at the lumbar level of the spinal cord (Kruger et al., 2006). As mentioned before, there are several reasons to assume that these elevated peripheral OT-levels are not simply and merely the result of intranasal uptake and release into the vascular system but more probably of long-term activation of the intrinsic OT-mechanisms controlling the peripheral levels. Combined information obtained from both the CSF- and the peripheral OT-levels is necessary to draw permanent conclusions, about the possibly cascading effects of IN-OT administration. Interestingly, Born et al. (2002) observed that most neuropeptides did not induce elevated peripheral levels after IN-administration, but peripheral level of AVP remained elevated for more than 80 min. This is quite remarkable for neuropeptides with such short peripheral half-lifes, virtually without access to the brain itself. Given the fact that the BBB blocks the entrance of peripheral OT into the brain and that even the altered stress responses, induced by IN-OT in monkeys, are not directly affecting the peripheral adrenals but probably reflecting a central nervous effect on the adrenals (Parker et al., 2005) it is clear that we have to look for other parameters than the peripheral levels of OT to understand the effects of IN-OT.",

            "text": "Apparently, we need information about the brain- and CSF levels of OT after IN-administration, and for OT this information was completely lacking, until a recent paper from Neumann et al., who showed in a microdialysis study on rats and mice, that both central and peripheral OT-levels are elevated within 30 min and they argued convincingly that the central levels were not caused by the peripheral levels, but followed the rules of separate mechanisms (Neumann et al., 2013). Their findings support what is known for a variety of other substances, including several neuropeptides. From these data, two \u2018general rules\u2019 emerge: after IN-administration: (1) brain/CSF-levels tend to be higher than the peripheral levels, sometimes higher than the levels obtained after i.v.-administration; (2) peripheral levels rise more slowly and are generally preceded by steeper rising brain/CSF-levels. Such effects have been shown for neuropeptides and hormones like CCK-8 (Pietrowsky et al., 2001, Pietrowsky et al., 1996), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Yang et al., 2009), MSH/ACTH (Born et al., 2002), insulin-like growth factor-1 (Thorne et al., 2004) and hexarelin (Yu and Kim, 2009), as well as for a variety of other substances like testosterone (Banks et al., 2009), estradiol (Ohman et al., 1980, Wang et al., 2006), ergoloid mesylate (Chen et al., 2008), gastrodin (Wang et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2008), cephalexin (Sakane et al., 1991), tetramethylpyrazine (Feng et al., 2009), and the angiotensin antagonist GR138950 (Charlton et al., 2008). This list can be extended easily but these suffice to illustrate that IN-administration of substances mostly results in faster peaks and/or higher brain concentrations than peripheral administration. Only in the case of vasopressin, peripheral levels tended to rise about as fast as the central levels and both levels showed long-term elevations (Born et al., 2002), remarkably similar to what has been observed in the peripheral OT-levels after IN-administration (Burri et al., 2008, Landgraf, 1985, Neumann et al., 2013). These findings suggest that the coordination between peripheral and central levels of vasopressin and OT is organized in a different way compared to other peptides/substances. There is no reason, however, to expect that OT behaves differently intracranially and we assume that after IN-OT-administration earlier and higher peaks of OT occur in the (rostral parts of) the brain, preceding the effects on peripheral levels of OT. However, experimental verification of these assumptions is absolutely necessary.",

Some studies reported the possible effects on peripheral organs (pregnancy rates and male sexual functions and orgasm) (Ishak et al., 2008, Ochsenkuhn et al., 2010, Walch et al., 2001) as well as stress reduction (Quirin et al., 2011).

In 2005, Parker et al. applied 50 \u03bcg OT intranasally in adult female squirrel monkeys to study its effects on the stress-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Parker et al., 2005). The anti-stress effects of IN-OT were reflected by lowered ACTH levels without affecting cortisol levels suggesting a central point of action. In more recent studies in marmoset monkeys, Smith et al. (2010) demonstrated that daily treatment with 50 \u03bcg for 30 days facilitated pair-bond formation and social relationships, while clear reinforcement effects were obtained in rhesus macaques (Chang et al., 2012). Quite recently it was shown that IN-applied OT reaches the amygdala in rats and mice, while the prosocial effects of OT were also observed in rats (Lukas et al., 2013, Neumann et al., 2013). Finally, the effects of chronic IN-OT were studied in adolescent male prairie voles (Bales et al., 2012). After an initial \u2018prosocial\u2019 effect, the long-term changes showed a deficit in partner preference and pair bonding, containing the warning that \u201cLong-term developmental treatment with OT may show results different to those predicted by short-term studies\u201d (Bales et al., 2012).",

We assume that the \u2018peripheral effects\u2019 of IN-OT reported in the earliest studies contained a strong \u2018central component\u2019, activating lactation and labor. Soon after the initial reports about the effects of IN-OT on lactation (Newton and Egli, 1958, Stern, 1961) the effects on labor were described (Borglin, 1962, Salvatore, 1963) and in the next 20 years many aspects of the labor-inducing effects of IN-OT were investigated (Andreasson et al., 1985, Hohmann et al., 1986, Hoover, 1971, Lundin et al., 1986), concurrent with the marketing of the intranasal OT-spray \u2018syntocinon\u2019 for the specific clinical indication of labor induction (Engstrom, 1958). Occasional recent reports about the effects of IN-OT on lactation concern the possible specific applications for mothers of preterm infants (Fewtrell et al., 2006) and for tetraplegic mothers (Cowley, 2005).",

Many additional papers are available wherein the presence of OTR in specific brain areas was studied in detail (Bale et al., 2001, Bale et al., 1995, Blanks et al., 2007, Blume et al., 2008, Ebner et al., 2005, Ebner et al., 2000, Engelmann et al., 1998, Ingram and Moos, 1992, Knobloch et al., 2012, Neumann, 2008, Neumann et al., 2000a, Neumann et al., 2000b, Neumann and Landgraf, 2012, Viviani et al., 2011), mostly in combination with the use of OT-(ant)agonists or some kind of manipulation to induce a change in the local density of OTR, but discussing them would go far beyond the scope of the present review. From the papers mentioned above, the following four important notions can be derived:-The diversity and variability in density of OTR is impressive, both between different brain areas in a single brain, as well as between brains of different species. The latter aspect implies that simple extrapolations of findings from one species to another are virtually impossible.-The variability over time is also impressive, because desensitization processes and internalization of OTR may occur in a few minutes but similar rapid increases in OT-binding have been observed as well (Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001).-The variability over time is region-specific as it has been shown that specific factors (castration or administration of steroids like estrogen, testosterone, progesterone and glucocorticoids) all have their own region-specific effect on the distribution of OTR and these effects may be even completely contrary in species like mouse and rat (for a review: Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001).-In many brain areas a serious mismatch has been observed between the presence and abundance or the lack of OT-IR fibers and the local density of the OTR (Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001).\n",

Therefore, we may better focus first on the distribution patterns of OT entering the cranial cavity after intranasal application as well as on experimental findings showing effects IN-OT in specific brain areas. Since such studies have not been published yet for OT itself, we have to rely on other available studies showing detailed distribution patterns over time.",

To mention a few of the rostral, ventral and superficial brain regions involved: olfactory bulbs and anterior olfactory nuclei, piriform, periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortices, central and corticomedial amygdaloid nuclei, anterior cingulate cortex, ventral subiculum, hypothalamic nuclei, especially the ventral ones like supraoptic, arcuate and ventrolateral ventromedial nuclei, ventral tegmental and pontine nuclei, and possibly the trigeminal nuclei in the caudal brainstem. In how far some of the brain regions surrounding the ventricular system, like paraventricular and other hypothalamic nuclei, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, lateral septal and dorsal hippocampal regions, the periaqueductal gray, the raphe nuclei locus coeruleus and the solitary complex, are also directly accessible for the IN-applied OT, remains to be investigated. If not, one or more of the brain areas mentioned earlier, may influence the neural activity in the latter group of nuclei. The impressive effects of OT in the olfactory bulbs in the rat either by direct administration on maternal behavior (Yu et al., 1996a) or on social recognition memory after vaginocervical stimulation (Larrazolo-Lopez et al., 2008) show clearly how the olfactory bulbs are participating in extensive neural circuits, involved in the induction of major behavioral and physiological changes. It is tempting to consider the possibility that activation of the dendritic release mechanisms in the magnocellular OT-neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus could provide a signal towards other brain regions surrounding the ventricular system (Veening et al., 2010). Some well-designed Fos-studies would certainly bring us further, at this point.",

Electrophysiological studies in humans associated the suppression of EEG \u03bc/\u03b1-bands with perception of biological movement execution as well as social stimuli (Cochin et al., 1999, Gastaut and Bert, 1954, Oberman et al., 2008) and it has been shown that IN-OT modulates this rhythm during perception of biologically relevant motions (Perry et al., 2010). The OT system may be seriously disturbed in autistic children (Green et al., 2001, Modahl et al., 1998) and shifting the balance between vasopressin and OT may restore the emotional balance (Neumann and Landgraf, 2012). Recently, it was also proposed that olfactory bulb dysgenesis could lead to a dysfunctioning mirror neuron system and dysregulation of autonomic functions as a neural basis for autism via the so-called \u2018emotional pathway\u2019 and that OT is seriously involved in the underlying neural mechanisms (Brang and Ramachandran, 2010).",

            "text": "The starting point for the effects of intranasally applied OT can be localized in the olfactory system itself. The olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) themselves contain vasopressin-receptors, which are activated by OT as well via the V1a receptor (Levasseur et al., 2004) which implies that OSN-activity may be influenced directly upon IN-OT-administration. Consequently, the olfactory bulbs are necessarily and directly involved. Since the original studies of Kendrick and Keverne (Kendrick et al., 1988, Kendrick et al., 1991, Kendrick et al., 1997, Keverne and Kendrick, 1994) the studies of Yu et al., 1996a, Yu et al., 1996b and most recently of (Arakawa et al., 2010, Fang et al., 2008, Larrazolo-Lopez et al., 2008, Sanchez-Andrade and Kendrick, 2009, Wacker and Ludwig, 2011) it is obvious that the olfactory bulbs play a crucial role. While Yu et al. (1996b) found clear indications that transport via the CSF played a role in the effects of paraventricular hypothalamic OT, icv manipulations turned out to be much less effective than direct bulbar administration (Yu et al., 1996a). Inside the olfactory bulb, both mitral and granule cells appear to be involved in the induction of short- and long -term potentiation (Fang et al., 2008, Osako et al., 2000, Osako et al., 2001, Yu et al., 1996b). The mitral cells project directly to the supraoptic nucleus (Hatton and Yang, 1989, Hatton and Yang, 1990, Meddle et al., 2007, Meddle et al., 2000) in addition to the more extensively explored projections to anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex and medial and cortical amygdaloid nucei (Ghosh et al., 2011, Kang et al., 2011a, Kang et al., 2011b, Miyamichi et al., 2011, Nagayama et al., 2010, Shipley, 1985, Sosulski et al., 2011). Quite recently it was reported that the amygdaloid region of rats and mice clearly shows elevated levels of OT after IN-administration (Neumann et al., 2013). These areas have direct and reciprocal connections with hypothalamic brain areas like the medial preoptic nucleus (Coolen et al., 1997, Usunoff et al., 2009, Veening and Coolen, 1998) or the principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Gu et al., 2003) of which structure the projections cover many of brain structures related to various kinds of social behavior. Many of the brain areas controlling sexual behavior are directly involved in this set of projections (Coolen and Hull, 2004, Gu and Simerly, 1997, Hull, 2011, Hull et al., 2004, Northcutt and Lonstein, 2009, Olivier et al., 2007, Triemstra et al., 2005). Given that amygdaloid projections contact the ventral striatum, especially the accumbens nuclei, composing an essential part of the reward mechanisms (Ferguson et al., 2001, Ikemoto, 2007, Mucignat-Caretta, 2010, Novejarque et al., 2011) from where the cingulate and other parts of the frontal cortex are within immediate reach (Del Arco and Mora, 2008, Ishikawa et al., 2008, McGinty and Grace, 2008, Rigoard et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2011), it is clear that the olfactory pathways have fast access to numerous behavioral mechanisms, in a matter of seconds. In addition, it has been shown that oxytocin-dopamine interactions have a direct effect on maternal behavior in the rat (Shahrokh et al., 2010).",

(2005) showed that the ACTH-depressing effects of IN-OT in monkeys affected brain regions without involving the adrenals directly. In the same year, Kirsch et al. demonstrated in humans for the first time that IN-OT modulates the neural circuitry for social cognition and fear. Their fMRI studies not only showed a depression of amygdaloid activation after fear-inducing visual stimuli but also a reduced coupling between amygdala and brainstem regions implicated in the autonomic and behavioral manifestations of fear. These effects were corroborated by Domes et al. (2007a), especially in the right amygdala of men with modulating effects on prefrontal and temporal cortical areas and in the brainstem. In a later study, however, Domes et al. (2010) reported that in women the BOLD-signal was enhanced in the left amygdala, the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus in response to fearful faces and in the inferior frontal gyrus in response to angry and happy faces. They conclude that future studies should include both sexes to determine a possible sexual dimorphism in the neural effects of OT. A similar activation of the left fusiform gyrus was observed in a study relating genetic variations in the OT-system with autism (Sauer et al., 2012).",

When confronted with a crying infant, however, amygdala activation was also reduced but now in combination with an increased activation of the insula and the inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis (Riem et al., 2011).",

While a direct projection has been described from the OT-neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus to the olfactory bulb (Yu et al., 1996a, Yu et al., 1996b) the density of the OT-innervation of the amygdala is relatively weak and was described recently in relation to fear responses (Knobloch et al., 2012) and the mismatch with the numerous amygdaloid OT-receptors can be bridged only by Volume-Transmission as shown by the experiments of Yu et al., 1996a, Yu et al., 1996b and as discussed by others (Herkenham, 1987, Leng et al., 2005, Ludwig and Leng, 2006, Veening et al., 2010). Interestingly, the plasticity of the oxytocin receptors is impressive as they are strongly influenced by estrogen-, corticosteroid- and cholesterol levels (Burger et al., 2000, Gimpl et al., 2000, Insel et al., 1992, Ivell et al., 2001, Liberzon and Young, 1997, McEwen, 1988, Mitchell and Schmid, 2001, Muth et al., 2011, Terenzi et al., 1999, Uchoa et al., 2009, Witt et al., 1991, Zingg et al., 1998) as well as cocaine and fluoxetine (Johns et al., 2004) but also by peripheral OT-levels around parturition (Meddle et al., 2007) in a region-specific way. Most importantly, all relevant brain areas mentioned are in the possession of the relevant receptors (Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001, Gould and Zingg, 2003).",

Recently, much detailed information has become available about differential axonal projections from the main olfactory system of the mouse into the olfactory cortical areas suggesting a wider and more specific distribution of olfactory information than previously expected (Ghosh et al., 2011, Kang et al., 2011a, Kang et al., 2011b, Miyamichi et al., 2011, Nagayama et al., 2010).",

We agree with Churchland and Winkielman (2012) that it is less appropriate to describe the effects in terms of an \u2018anti-autism-\u2019 or an \u2018anti-schizophrenia-\u2019 drug as this description is too limited to encompass the wide range of neural effects, potentially possible after activation of the olfactory connections in combination with the central and medial parts of the amygdaloid complex. As discussed, these brain areas have numerous entrances to a variety of forebrain and brainstem areas, and may even increase aggression under the proper circumstances (Hahn-Holbrook et al., 2011). Future connectivity studies will provide a wealth of additional information concerning the specific role of particular areas of the human brain under specific testing conditions.",

At the electron-microscopical level many questions are open concerning the character, the location and the cerebral and extracerebral spaces connecting the olfactory nasal and the olfactory brain regions. Not only these transport mechanisms need more attention but also the mechanisms involved in the further distribution of IN-applied-OT. The application of labeled OT may be necessary to study these mechanisms in more detail, and such studies have to start within the first minute after the IN-administration. For a better idea about the possible involvement of the CSF and/or the intercellular spaces or the distribution of IN-applied-OT, it may be useful to study larger animals like sheep as well, since such studies have provided unique information about the distribution of other neuroactive substances like GnRH and melatonin.",

The orange arrows indicate the flow of oxytocin (OT) from the natural hypothalamic sources: the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) and the supraoptic nucleus (SON). After (dendritic) release OT follows the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the ventricular system and along the external surface of the brain. Eventually, more than 50% of the \u2018central\u2019 OT is leaving the cranial cavity along the olfactory fibers, through the cribriform plate into the nose lymphatics. The blue arrows suggest the entrance of intranasally applied OT (in-OT), entering the cranial cavity and the CSF along the olfactory fibers but possibly also by following the trigeminal nerve. The scheme is based on assumptions obtained from other neuropeptide studies (like Thorne et al., 2004), since the entrance and distribution of in-OT itself has never been studied, yet. The arrows suggest a rostral to caudal distribution through the brain and CSF from the rostral entrance, supported by the OT entering the brainstem along the trigeminal fibers (but this entrance remains to be shown to be relevant for OT!). The more strongly \u2018inundated\u2019 parts of the brain appear to be the ventral parts and include the hypothalamus and amygdaloid regions. For further details, see text, and Veening et al.
