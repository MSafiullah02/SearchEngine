            "text": "Yellow head virus (YHV) is one of the most devastating shrimp pathogens as it causes mortality within 3 days. This virus was first identified in 1992 from moribund shrimp from southern Thailand (Boonyaratpalin et al., 1993). The virus was named from symptoms of the disease in which the moribund shrimp would present a yellowish cephalothorax and very sallow overall coloration. YHV can infect various penaeid shrimp such as Penaeus aztecus, Penaeus duorarum, Penaeus merguiensis, Penaeus monodon, Penaeus setiferus, Penaeus stylirostris and Litopenaeus vannamei (Flegel, 1997). The infected moribund shrimp shows nuclear condensation as well as pyknosis and karyorrhexis which are signs of cell apoptosis (Khanobdee et al., 2002). YHV has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 27 kb with a poly (A) tail. It belongs to the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae in the order Nidovirales. The morphology of YHV reveals an enveloped bacilliform which has a particle size about 50\u201360 \u00d7 190\u2013200 nm, containing the internal helical nucleocapsid which is closely surrounded by an envelope studded with prominent peplomers or spikes (Nadala et al., 1997, Sittidilokratna et al., 2008). YHV contains two major structural transmembrane glycoproteins (gp116 and gp64) and a nucleoprotein (p20) (Jitrapakdee et al., 2003). Antiserum against the gp116 but not gp64 can neutralize YHV infectivity in the primary lymphoid cells of Penaeus monodon (Assavalapsakul et al., 2005). In addition, injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting to the YHV-binding protein, YRP65, inhibited YHV replication (Assavalapsakul et al., 2006). Also, suppression of PmRab7 (a late endosomal marker involved in trafficking) resulted in inhibition of YHV replication (Ongvarrasopone et al., 2008). These results imply that for successful infection, YHV requires receptor mediated endocytosis as a route of entry and takes advantage of the host cell machineries for endosomal trafficking and replication. Therefore, better understanding of the endocytosis and trafficking pathway of YHV will shed light on the mechanism of YHV infection and replication and thus will lead to the development of an antiviral agent or strategy to combat YHV infection.",

            "text": "Many viruses utilize well-characterized cellular endocytic mechanisms including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, lipid raft caveola-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis to internalize into host cells. For instance, several positive-sense ssRNA viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (Inoue et al., 2007), hepatitis C, dengue and semliki forest virus use clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Marsh and Helenius, 2006, Meertens et al., 2006, Mercer et al., 2010) as a route of entry. In clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the cargo is trafficked through the cell via the coated vesicle which is surrounded by the polymerized clathrin in a basket-like structure. The formation of the endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles occurs through the interaction of clathrin, heterotetrameric adaptor protein-2 (AP-2), and several accessory proteins such as Epsin, Eps15, AP180/CALM and dynamin. Clathrin, in which the light chain and heavy chain form a unique structure called the clathrin triskelion, as well as AP-2 are recruited by epsin to the plasma membrane in response to receptor-mediated internalization signals. Epsin then mediates the assembly of a clathrin cage, which results in membrane curvature induced by the coated-pit formation. Once assembled, the clathrin-coated pits are pinched off from the plasma membrane by dynamin to form clathrin-coated vesicles which are then trafficked to endosomes (Doherty and McMahon, 2009, Mousavi et al., 2004). Whether YHV utilizes this pathway as a route of entry into shrimp cells remained to be investigated. Therefore, one purpose of this study was to characterize the YHV entry pathway by using several trafficking inhibitors. P. monodon clathrin heavy chain (PmCHC), a major protein component in the clathrin-dependent pathway was cloned and characterized. The suppression effect of PmCHC in YHV-challenged shrimp also was investigated.",

The protein contains several conserved domains: clathrin propeller repeat (amino acid: 205\u2013241, 259\u2013295, 303\u2013337), clathrin heavy chain linker (amino acid 338\u2013361), clathrin-H-link (amino acid 363\u2013428), and clathrin heavy chain repeat homology (amino acid: 544\u2013682, 693\u2013831, 844\u2013978, 986\u20131127, 1139\u20131275, 1281\u20131423, 1434\u20131572) (Supplementary Fig. 1).

One clathrin propeller repeat is observed in plants including Zea mays and Theobroma cacao. However, three to four clathrin propeller repeats are found in both invertebrate and vertebrate species including P. monodon, Aedes aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens and Danio rerio (Table 2).

The function of PmCHC especially for yellow head virus (YHV) infection was tested to study the major route for YHV internalization. RNA interference (RNAi) was used as a tool to study the function of PmCHC. Shrimp injected with dsRNA-PmCHC showed reduction of PmCHC mRNA levels up to 90% when compared to the NaCl-injected control group. In addition, knockdown of PmCHC mRNA in YHV-challenged shrimp exhibited low levels of YHV expression (Fig. 5, Fig. 6C) and a delay in shrimp mortality up to 24 h post YHV injection (84\u2013108 hpi) (Fig. 6A). These effects may be due to suppression of PmCHC gene (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. 2). After knocking down of PmCHC mRNA, low levels of PmCHC present may slow down the entry of YHV into the cell, thus resulting in a delay of shrimp mortality. Moreover, the shrimp death may also be due to the depletion of clathrin heavy chain (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. 2). This is because clathrin heavy chain has diverse cellular functions such as transportation of cargo inside the cell, cytokinesis and glucose metabolism (Brodsky, 2012). Depletion of PmCHC may inhibit some cellular functions which are essential for cell survival. Several studies have shown that some viruses require clathrin heavy chain for infection (Bhattacharyya et al., 2010, Hongliang and Chengyu, 2009, Hussain et al., 2011). For instance, confocal microscopy demonstrated the colocalization between rhesus rhadinovirus and clathrin heavy chain (Zhang et al., 2010). Similar to this study, suppression of the clathrin heavy chain by small interfering RNA exhibited a reduction of viral load in the host cells, including influenza A virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or human enterovirus 71 (Hongliang and Chengyu, 2009, Hussain et al., 2011, Inoue et al., 2007). It has been shown that the cargo molecules that can be transported via clathrin-meditated endocytosis are size dependent, approximately 200 nm (Rejman et al., 2004) which nicely fit with the YHV virion, whose size is ~ 50\u201360 \u00d7 190\u2013200 nm (Nadala et al., 1997). In addition, a recent report showed the reduction of YHV level in clathrin coat AP17 knockdown shrimp (Jatuyosporn et al., 2014). Moreover, by using various inhibitors (CPZ, M\u03b2CD and amiloride), only the YHV-challenged shrimp pretreated with CPZ showed a significant reduction of YHV levels. These results suggested that the major route of YHV into the shrimp cells was via clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway.",

            "text": "In shrimp, a previous study has identified a protein in the endocytosis pathway, P. monodon Rab7 (PmRab7) (Sritunyalucksana et al, 2006). Rab7 is a small GTPase protein and plays a crucial role to regulate the transportation from late endosome to lysosome during endosome maturation (Huotari and Helenius, 2011). In addition, PmRab7 is required for several shrimp viruses such as white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), taura syndrome virus (TSV) Laem-Singh virus (LSNV) or YHV for intracellular trafficking inside the cell (Ongvarrasopone et al., 2008, Ongvarrasopone et al., 2010, Ongvarrasopone et al., 2011). Therefore based on the previous evidence and this study, the mechanism of YHV entry and intracellular trafficking can be proposed. YHV enters the shrimp cells by using the envelop protein gp116 to bind to YHV binding protein, PmYRP65 (Assavalapsakul et al., 2006). Then, many adaptor proteins which are involved in clathrin-coated pit formation including AP2, AP17 and PmCHC are recruited to induce membrane invagination to form clathrin-coated vesicles which then transport YHV to the early endosome which also may require Rab5 protein (Hutagalung and Novick, 2011, Stenmark, 2009). After that, YHV may be transported toward the late endosome and lysosome via the regulation by PmRab7 for viral uncoating. The intracellular trafficking process of YHV may be similar to that of semliki forest virus (SFV) which is internalized via clathrin mediated endocytosis and requires Rab7 for transportation inside the cell (Vonderheit and Helenius, 2005).",
