As of May 2019, MERS-CoV has been detected in 27 countries and infected more than 2300 patients (World Health Organization (2019) Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, available at https://www.who.int/csr/don/24-April-2019-mers-saudi-arabia/en/). Although the disease vanished almost completely from headlines and newspapers, it is still a potential threat to human health since approximately one third of all affected patients succumb to acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal dysfunction (Zumla et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Even though MERS-CoV is most likely derived from an ancestral reservoir in bats (Corman et al., 2014; Cui et al., 2013; de Wit and Munster, 2013; Memish et al., 2013; Munster et al., 2016; van Boheemen et al., 2012), transmission to humans occurs mainly via dromedaries, which represent a major reservoir for the virus in large parts of the Middle East, the Canary Islands, Africa, and Southern Asia (Falzarano et al., 2017; Haagmans et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2017; Saqib et al., 2017). Infection has also been demonstrated in farmed alpacas from a region of Qatar where MERS-CoV is endemic (Reusken et al., 2016), but not in any other livestock species (Reusken et al., 2013). Recently, experimental inoculation of pigs, alpacas, and llamas with MERS-CoV resulted in low levels of viral replication in pigs and moderate to high levels of viral replication and shedding in the latter species, respectively (Adney et al., 2016a; de Wit et al., 2017; Vergara-Alert et al., 2017). Similarly, minimal virus shedding was detected in goats, sheep, and horses after experimental infection, but only goats developed neutralizing antibodies (Adney et al., 2016b). Due to the close interactions of humans with potentially susceptible and contagious livestock species in certain parts of the world, the development of an effective vaccination strategy against MERS-CoV was proposed early after its initial discovery and was recently followed up by the development of protective antibodies by different protocols (Agrawal et al., 2016; Corti et al., 2015; Houser et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015; Pascal et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2014; Widjaja et al., 2019). Widjaja and colleagues (2019) developed a set of protective neutralizing and non-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which target different epitopes of the MERS-CoV spike (MERS-S) protein. The MERS-S protein is known to represent a key target for the development of new therapeutics and consists of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2 (Du et al., 2017). The subunit S1 is, in turn, composed of four different core domains. The domain S1B binds to the host-cell receptor dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4; Lu et al., 2013; Raj et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), while the domain S1A binds to sialoglycans which enhances infection of human lung cells by MERS-CoV (Li et al., 2017). The subunit S2 comprises the fusion peptide, two heptad repeats and a transmembrane domain, which mediate fusion of the virus with the cell membrane (Lu et al., 2013; Pallesen et al., 2017; Raj et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013).",

Immunohistochemistry is a well-established and powerful method which is frequently used for diagnostic purposes and evaluation of animal experiments. Simple protocols allow precise correlation between the presence and severity of lesions and the amount of viral antigen in the respective localization (Duraiyan et al., 2012). Even though there are several mono- and polyclonal antibodies available for the detection of the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid and spike protein on FFPE tissue (Haverkamp et al., 2018), these antibodies are all derived from rabbits and mice, respectively (https://www.biocompare.com, accessed March 11, 2019). However, for double or triple immunohistochemistry and -fluoresence labeling, it can be useful to have access to epitope-specific antibodies from different species, which can be used to visualize viral antigen in tissue sections. It was therefore the aim of the present study to evaluate the suitability of different human anti-MERS-S mAbs for detection of the respective antigen on FFPE material.",

Shortly, generation of anti-MERS-S H2L2 mAbs was achieved by recurrent immunization of transgenic H2L2 mice, which encode the human immunoglobulin variable regions, with the respective antigens and adjuvants (for preparation of antigens see original publications (Li et al., 2017; Mou et al., 2013; Walls et al., 2016; Widjaja et al., 2019)). At day 74, four days after the last immunization, spleen and lymph nodes were harvested and hybridoma cell lines were generated using the SP2/0 myeloma cell line. For production of recombinant mAbs, cDNA\u2019s encoding the variable heavy and light chain regions of anti-MERS-S H2L2 mAbs were cloned into expression plasmids containing the human IgG1 heavy chain and Ig kappa light chain constant regions, respectively. Recombinant human anti-MERS-S mAbs were produced in HEK-293 T cells following co-transfection of the IgG1 heavy and light chain expression plasmids (Invivogen) according to manufacturers\u2019 protocols (Widjaja et al., 2019). Antibodies were purified from tissue culture supernatants using Protein-A affinity chromatography. Purified antibodies were quantified using UV absorbance (280 nm) and Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE analysis was applied in addition. Antibodies were stored at 4 \u00b0C until further use. After screening for MERS-S reactivity and neutralizing capacity eight different mAbs (Table 1\n) were selected based on epitope distribution and neutralization.",

Staining with the same antibody without pretreatment revealed a similar distribution of viral antigen in a comparable number of cells but a less prominent expression pattern (Fig. 2B), which is most likely linked to the lack of antigen unmasking which takes place during antigen retrieval (Shi et al., 2011). Detection of MERS-CoV antigen by the 1.2g5 antibody was almost completely absent with pretreatment by enzymatic digestion in all three dilutions, resulting only in a pale brownish signal interpreted as non-specific background staining (data not shown).

The other five antibodies (1.6f9, 4.6e10, 7.7g6, 1.8e5, 3.5g6) did not reveal any recognizable specific staining of MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE tissue along with no to very mild (1.6f9, 4.6e10, Fig. 3\nA, B), mild (7.7g6, 1.8e5, Fig. 3C, D) and strong (3.5g6, Fig. 3E) non-specific background staining. By contrast, all antibodies displayed a distinct signal by immunofluorescence staining of MERS-CoV-infected Huh-7 cells in culture (Widjaja et al., 2019). Possible explanations for the lack of immunoreactivity on FFPE tissue include effacement of conformational epitopes by formalin fixation and/or antigen retrieval protocols (Smedley et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The tested antibodies in the present study were derived from transgenic mice expressing chimeric antibodies containing human variable domains and constant antibody domains of rat origin. For generation of fully human antibodies the human variable heavy and light chain encoding gene segments of the antibodies isolated from MERS-S immunized mice transgenic for human V genes were cloned into human IgG1 heavy and light chain expression vectors, respectively (Widjaja et al., 2019). All these antibodies are directed against MERS-S and belong to six distinct epitope groups that interfere with three critical entry functions in vivo. In particular, 1.2g5, 7.7g6, 1.6f9, 1.8e5, and 4.6e10 are neutralizing antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) S1B of the MERS-S protein (Widjaja et al., 2019), which facilitates virus binding to the DPP4 receptor on the host cell surface (Mou et al., 2013; Raj et al., 2013). The neutralizing antibodies 1.6c7 and 3.5g6 bind to the ectodomain of the membrane fusion subunit S2 which mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (Li et al., 2017; Widjaja et al., 2019). By contrast, antibody 1.10f3 is a non-neutralizing antibody that recognizes the sialic acid binding domain (Widjaja et al., 2019). Since the positive staining antibodies 1.2g5, 1.10f3 and 1.6c7 recognize epitopes that belong to different functional groups (DPP4 binding, sialic acid binding and membrane fusion, respectively), the suitability of mAbs for use in immunohistochemistry cannot be predicted from the function of their target epitopes in vivo.",

The best immunolabelling results for all three antibodies were achieved at the lowest dilution (1:5) with heat-induced antigen retrieval. However, results demonstrate that the suitability of the antibodies was unrelated to the function of their target epitopes in vivo and that commercially available monoclonal and polyclonal anti-nucleocapsid antibodies generally appear more suitable to detect MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE sections in routine diagnostics. However, for certain purposes such as double or triple immunohistochemistry, human mAbs might represent a promising alternative.",
