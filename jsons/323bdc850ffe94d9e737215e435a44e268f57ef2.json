            "text": "Background: Statins are lipid-lowering agents that inhibit cholesterol synthesis and are clinically used in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. However, a considerable group of patients does not respond to statin treatment, and the reason for this is still not completely understood. [ 18 F]Atorvastatin, the 18 Flabeled version of one of the most widely prescribed statins, may be a useful tool for statin-related research. Results: [ 18 F]Atorvastatin was synthesized via an optimized ruthenium-mediated late-stage 18 F-deoxyfluorination. The defluoro-hydroxy precursor was produced via Paal-Knorr pyrrole synthesis and was followed by coordination of the phenol to a ruthenium complex, affording the labeling precursor in approximately 10% overall yield. Optimization and automation of the labeling procedure reliably yielded an injectable solution of [ 18 F]atorvastatin in 19% \u00b1 6% (d.c.) with a molar activity of 65 \u00b1 32 GBq\u00b7\u03bcmol \u22121 . Incubation of [ 18 F]atorvastatin in human serum did not lead to decomposition. Furthermore, we have shown the ability of [ 18 F]atorvastatin to cross the hepatic cell membrane to the cytosolic and microsomal fractions where HMG-CoA reductase is known to be highly expressed. Blocking assays using rat liver sections confirmed the specific binding to HMG-CoA reductase. Autoradiography on rat aorta stimulated to develop atherosclerotic plaques revealed that [ 18 F]atorvastatin significantly accumulates in this tissue when compared to the healthy model. Conclusions: The improved ruthenium-mediated 18 F-deoxyfluorination procedure overcomes previous hurdles such as the addition of salt additives, the drying steps, or the use of different solvent mixtures at different phases of the process, which increases its practical use, and may allow faster translation to clinical settings. Based on tissue uptake evaluations, [ 18 F]atorvastatin showed the potential to be used as a tool for the understanding of the mechanism of action of statins. Further knowledge of the in vivo biodistribution of [ 18 F]atorvastatin may help to better understand the origin of off-target effects and potentially allow to distinguish between statin-resistant and non-resistant patients.",

            "text": "Cardiovascular diseases represent one of the leading causes of death globally [1] . Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory pathology characterized by deposition of plaques (a collection of fat, cholesterol, calcium, fibrin, and cellular waste products) in the walls of arteries, is the dominant cause of cardiovascular diseases [2] . The partial rupture and detachment of these plaques increase the risk of clogging the blood flow, which, ultimately, can lead to highly incapacitating or even mortal conditions such as myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accidents [3] . The exact cause of atherosclerosis remains a subject of discussion and has been connected to several distinct mechanisms, hypotheses, and theories [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Nonetheless, despite its complexity, atherosclerosis is generally correlated to the levels of cholesterol in plasma [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase is involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and is subject to feedback regulation by end-products of this same pathway [23] [24] [25] [26] . Thus, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase with statins became an essential strategy for the primary prevention of atherosclerosis. Statins contain a dihydroxycarboxylic acid moiety that mimics and outcompetes the natural substrate molecule HMG-CoA, preventing its reduction to mevalonate and further cholesterol synthesis [27, 28] (Fig. 1a) .",

Statins are increasingly being associated with potential protective effects on pathologies beyond cardiovascular diseases (e.g., respiratory [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] , carcinogenic [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] , viral [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] , neurodegenerative [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] ). The exact off-target mechanisms of statins, along with the reason why many patients show resistance to this class of drugs, are still unknown. Therefore, an increase of specific knowledge of the subcellular mechanisms affected by statins and the development of a more sensitive tool to investigate this subject are currently challenging hot topics in medicinal chemistry [54, 55] . High-resolution molecular imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET), together with sensitive nuclear analytical techniques relying on radiolabeled molecules, can help in a better understanding by mapping the biodistribution profile over time within complex living organisms. To this purpose, we report the 18 F-labeling of atorvastatin (12) , one of the most widely used statins in the prevention of cardiovascular risk factors and one of the bestselling drugs in pharmaceutical history [56] . Exchanging the aryl fluoride with its 18 F radioisotope enables the radiolabeling of atorvastatin without changing its pharmacological properties. However, in the case of atorvastatin, the 18 F-fluorination of electron-rich arenes is a classical struggle in radiochemistry and has challenges associated with synthesis automation [57] . The fluorine-containing aromatic ring within the atorvastatin structure is electron-rich, and therefore, we use the ruthenium-mediated radiodeoxyfluorination strategy [58] [59] [60] . This radiotracer may have the potential to become an attractive tool for statin-related research, enabling the understanding of cellular and subcellular mechanisms, the identification of off-target activity and, ultimately, allowing to select between statin-resistant and non-resistant patients for targeted therapy.

However, reversing the cartridge cannot easily be implemented in most automated modules. Also, since the MP-1 mini-cartridge is not commercially available and should, therefore, be manually prepared, it might result in significant elution differences from batch to batch, which will affect the activity yield. This led us to the evaluation of different solvent systems (without the use of eluent additives) to increase the elution efficiency (Table 2) .",

Using a mixture of methanol:veratrole (1:3 v:v) or methanol:DMSO (1:3 v:v) provided the best results. However, the mixture with veratrole quickly builds up high pressure in the reaction vial at 140\u00b0C (with some associated radioactivity escape). Thus, replacing veratrole by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is the safer choice of solvent. This optimized method boosted and simplified the 18 F-deoxyfluorination technique by avoiding the addition of salt additives, skipping any need for washing the trapped [ 18 F]fluoride, circumventing time-consuming azeotropic drying (with the consequent radioactivity losses by natural decay, evaporation, and unspecific adsorption to the reactor surface) and the use of different solvent mixtures for the various steps of the process (elution and 18 F-fluorination). The amount of Ru-coordinated precursor 8 was also reduced in relation to the previously reported 18 F-deoxyfluorination works (2.5 \u03bcmol vs. 5.0 \u03bcmol) [58] [59] [60] . During the optimization work, it became evident that some procedure deviations such as air bubbling instead of stirring, absence of mechanical mixing, increased solvent volumes, larger reaction vials, or flat-shaped bottom ones can decrease the final 18 F-deoxyfluorination yield. In order to enhance the radiolabeling efficiency, these are features that should be considered when choosing the most suitable radiosynthesis module.",

To evaluate the potential of [ 18 F]atorvastatin ([ 18 F]12) as a PET tracer for atherosclerosis, an autoradiography imaging study was performed on an excised aorta from an apolipoprotein Edeficient rat model designed to develop atherosclerotic plaques [71] . The uptake of the radiotracer was statistically significant higher in atherosclerotic aorta when compared to a healthy rat aorta. Furthermore, the pretreatment with the reference compound 12 blocked [ 18 F]atorvastatin ([ 18 F]12) binding, which supported the potential of this PET tracer to be used for the specific detection of atherosclerotic plaques. As a result of several decades in clinical use, the toxicological profile of atorvastatin (12) is widely known. Thus, first in human studies that are already being envisaged at our Nuclear Medicine Department are not being hampered by toxicity issues.",

The affinity of [ 18 F]atorvastatin ([ 18 F]12) to HMG-CoA reductase and its potential to be used as a PET tracer for atherosclerosis was confirmed in rat liver samples and by comparison of the radiotracer uptake in the aorta of a normal and atherosclerotic rat model.

The [ 18 F]fluoride was then eluted from the cartridge with a solution of the labeling precursor 8 (2.5 \u03bcmol), N,N-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl-1-chloroimidazolium chloride (13, 6.0 equiv.), and bis(trimethylneopentylammonium) oxalate in a mixture of ethanol: pivalonitrile:veratrole (400 \u03bcL, 1:4:4 v:v:v) directly into a reaction vial [60].
