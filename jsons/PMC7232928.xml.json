            "text": "At a glance, the coronaviruses (CoV) are viruses that are known to cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurologic diseases that may be mild or severe [1]. The coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense viruses with 30-kb single-stranded polyadenylated RNA that bears five genes that code for structural proteins (S, E, M, N, HE), as well as other non-structural proteins encoding genes. These structural proteins include the spike (S) protein that enables the virus to recognize the right cellular receptor where it infects the susceptible cell. The spike protein is also responsible for the corona shape of the virus. The envelope (E) protein assembles the virion and ensures the optimum curvature of the viral envelope. The membrane (M) protein aids in the formation of the corona shape of the virus, as well as maintains the structure of the virion through its interaction with all the other structural proteins. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is responsible for encapsulating the viral genome in a helical nucleocapsid inside the viral particle. Lastly, the haemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein, similar to the S protein, plays a role in haemagglutination. It functions as acetyl-esterase, which aids in the release of the viral particles from the infected cell occurring during the end of the replication cycle in \u03b2-coronaviruses [2]. The coronaviruses are known to be capable of rapid mutation and recombination [1, 3, 4]. The coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Members of this family include the pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoV) such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 and the more commonly known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5]. The currently named SARS-CoV-2 (by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) [6], commonly known as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a newly discovered member of the CoV (considered highly pathogenic) that resembles the SARS-CoV in that they elicit similar symptoms and share similar receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), thus the reason for its name [7, 8].",

According to data available on the WHO website, as of 17 April 2020, COVID-19 has currently infected over 2 million people worldwide, and the numbers continue to rise. There are well over 130 thousand confirm deaths globally, with more than 200 countries affected. The prominent clinical features presented by the SARS-CoV-2 include common symptoms like fever and dry cough usually occurring especially at the onset of the disease [5, 9, 10]. The subsequent characteristic symptoms presented in patients are respiratory distress syndrome (dyspnoea), myalgia, anorexia, diarrhoea, pharyngalgia, abdominal pain and fatigue [11]. Though human CoV are mostly known to cause respiratory diseases, there have been concerns of both direct and indirect neurological consequences [2, 12, 13]; however, this has often been neglected. Furthermore, a new study by Mao and colleagues highlighted characteristic clinical neurological signs presented by patients infected by the novel SARS-CoV-2 [14]. Therefore, this review aims to demonstrate, from recent evidence, the possible neurological impact of the coronaviruses on the CNS, while highlighting neurologic implications for the novel SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "With its S protein, when the SARS-CoV (or SARS-CoV-2 as the case may be) binds to the ACE-2, it will result in the downregulation of ACE-2 expression as well as mediating the entry and replication of the virus. Note that SARS-CoV-2 cannot downregulate the expression of ACE. Typically, in the renin-angiotensin system, ACE binds on its substrate, the decapeptide angiotensin 1 (Ang 1), cleaving it to yield a product, octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II). The accumulation of Ang II is known to mediate severe lung injury by acting on angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a) receptors. Interestingly, in this ideal situation, ACE-2 plays a protective role by cleaving Ang II to yield angiotensin 1\u20137. It also cleaves Ang I to generate angiotensin 1\u20139. The novel SARS-CoV-2 potentiates infection by binding on the ACE-2, thereby downregulating their expression. This loss of ACE-2 expression, therefore, elicits the dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system, which causes an elevated production of angiotensin II (Ang II) that acts on both angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a) and angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors. The action of Ang II on AT2 receptors inhibits their expression, whereas its action on AT1a receptors activates them. It has also been shown that the reduction in AT2 expression exacerbates acute lung injury. On the other hand, the activation of AT1a receptor will also mediate Ang II\u2013induced vascular permeability and severe acute lung injury. Taken together, the consequential reduction in ACE-2 expression and the increased production of Ang II correlates to severe acute lung injury [18, 23]. Also facilitating the entry and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, via its interaction with ACE-2, is priming of the virus\u2019 S protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) gene [24]. This pathologic mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 1.",

Several techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and real-time reverse transcription-PCR have been used to detect CoV presence in the brain [25, 26]. This has led several authors to focus their research on identifying the possible routes by which this virus invades the CNS. Several studies have postulated the olfactory\u2013haematogenous pathway (Fig. 2), trans-neuronal machinery (Fig. 3) and lymphatic pathway, as putative routes of coronavirus entry into the CNS [12, 26].",

            "text": "The olfactory tract has been implicated as a major route through which toxicants reaches the CNS. It is then of no surprise that it has been implicated as a possible route for HCoV invasion into the CNS, and this is likely to include the SARS-CoV-2. Several authors like McCray et al. [27], Butler et al. [28] and Netland et al. [26] have reported that after an intranasal infection, both HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV which are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 were shown to infect the respiratory tract in mice and to be neuroinvasive. Numerous data over the years have shown that several strains of CoV such as neurotropic MHV, SARS-CoV34 or MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 are certainly neuroinvasive in both mice and humans [28\u201331]. Additionally, early steps of subsequent neuropropagation within the CNS in susceptible mice have been delineated, as well as in humans [31]. Upon reaching the respiratory airways, HCoV could cross the basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells [32] into the blood circulation and spread to other tissues including the CNS [33, 34] (Fig. 2). Although HCoV are mostly limited to the respiratory airways, the ability of these viruses to spread to other tissues, including the CNS has been severally documented [13, 35]. In the circulation, a virus will infect either endothelial cells of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) or epithelial cells of the blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) in the choroid plexus (CP) located in the ventricles of the brain, or leukocytes that will serve as a vector for dissemination towards the CNS [34]. Therefore, it is possible that the novel SARS-CoV-2 could also be neuroinvasive via haematogenous respiratory pathways (Fig. 2). Furthermore, a case could also be made for direct HCoV neuroinvasion through olfactory receptors, as other neurotropic viruses including, influenza, herpes simplex and poliovirus have been observed to migrate along axons of olfactory receptor neurons (of olfactory epithelium) into the CNS [36, 37] (Fig. 2).",

The trans-synaptic transfer has been well documented for other CoV, such as HEV679-10 [42]. HEV 67N are the first CoV found to invade the porcine brain, and it shares more than 91% homology with the novel SARS-CoV-2 [43, 44]. In susceptible mice, HCoV-OC43 showed a selective tropism for neurons in which it is able to use axonal transport as a way of neuron-to-neuron propagation [31], further proving the neuronal transgenic retrograde machinery as a possible mechanism of CoV (including SARS-CoV-2) neuroinvasion (Fig. 3).",

Although the exact mechanism is not known, different strains of CoV, including SARS-CoV, have the ability to infect cells involved in intrinsic immunity. Through these cells, they are able to spread to several tissues, including the CNS [45]. This is consistent with findings in mice where the murine counterpart of HCoV, the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), invaded the CNS through the lymphatic systems [46].

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease of CNS characterized by demyelination, is one of these disorders and has been repetitively associated with the CoV neuro-infection. Although several viral infections have been associated as one of the aetiologies of this disease, numerous authors were able to detect the presence of CoV in the brain of MS patients proving its involvement in the pathogenesis MS. Interestingly, upper respiratory infections of viral origin were shown to be an important trigger of MS attacks. Apart from human studies, several works on animal models have associated MHV (the murine counterpart of HCoV) with MS [46]. Other disorders of the CNS linked to CoV infection are meningitis and encephalitis [47, 50]. Li et al. [48] conducted a study on clinically diagnosed acute encephalopathy patients with CoV infection. They reported that these patients experienced neurological symptoms such as headache, convulsion and altered levels of consciousness. During the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, also known as COVID-19, several doctors have reported neurological symptoms like strokes, seizures, encephalitis-like symptoms and acroparesthesia in COVID-19 patients. They also reported that these patients suffering with encephalopathy are usually confused and lethargic [14, 49].",

[55], they observed a reduced size in the hippocampus in mice following HCoV infection, which they inferred could trigger deficits in higher neurological functions such as learning and memory. This finding is supported by a growing number of human studies showing sudden changes in memory, learning and attention preceded by the release of cytokines [55]. Cytokine release has been connected with CoV infection [64]. Furthermore, a single-centre cohort study in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors found that a longer duration of hypoxemia\u2014a characteristic symptom of SARS-CoV-2 [49]\u2014was associated with cognitive impairment [65]. Hypoxia has been linked to brain atrophy, lateral ventricle enlargement and concomitant impairments in memory [61].",

In an instance, Schelling and Kapfhammer [67] noted that patients who survived ARDS often had substantial residual angst, with vivid and distorted frightening memories of what they had experienced even after their acute brain dysfunction had resolved. Adhikari et al. [68] and Bienvenu et al. [69] also reported the incidence of depression and non-specific anxiety in patients with respiratory disorders. Characteristic symptoms such as altered mental status, personality change, abnormal behaviour or speech, and movement disorders have been associated with CoV-induced encephalopathy infection [47]. In a behavioural study conducted by Jacomy et al. [55], CoV-infected mice exhibited decreased activity in an open field test. In the same study, the mice exhibited decreased locomotor activity, exploration pattern, sniffing and sifting in the open field test, all indicating depression and anxiety [55]. This is consistent with the study by Severance et al. [59] where CoV infection was associated with psychologic disorders, for instance, bipolar disorder and depression in patients.",

            "text": "The ability of CoV to invade the brain and cause alteration in brain structures have been reported in several studies. Following neuroinvasion, these viruses accumulate in different brain regions such as the dorsal vagal complex (solitary nucleus, area postrema and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus), which is critical for cardiorespiratory function, as well as the basal ganglia, piriform and infralimbic region of the cortex, and the dorsal raphe of the midbrain. Therefore, it can be implied that the sudden and severe symptoms occurring in CoV infection (including SARS-CoV2) may result from subsequent functional impairment of these critical brain regions [26]. HCoV including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been heavily detected in the brainstem, specifically in the solitary nucleus and nucleus ambiguous. Chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors in lungs and respiratory tract sends sensory information to the solitary nucleus, while nerve supply to blood vessels, airway smooth muscle and glands are efferent fibres derived from the solitary nucleus and the nucleus ambiguous [42]. These connections indicate that respiratory distress experienced during SAR-CoV2 infection may be due to malfunction of the brainstem\u2019s cardiorespiratory centre [42, 48]. Li et al. [48] used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to perform some imaging diagnostics on patients with CoV-induced encephalopathy. They observed some abnormality in the temporal lobe, the periventricular region, basal ganglia and the thalamus. Netland et al. [26] also observed infection and structural alteration in the cardiorespiratory centre in the medulla of SARS-CoV-induced mice. Additionally, Jacomy et al. [55] demonstrated that mice that survived from CoV-induced acute encephalitis exhibited a reduced hippocampus.",

[55] postulated apoptosis as the mechanism involved in neuronal loss observed in CA1 and CA3 layers of the hippocampus in CoV-induced acute encephalitis mice. They were able to support their finding by demonstrating the immunopresence of caspase-3 along with nuclear fragmentation in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons. Caspases are the principal executors of apoptotic cell death, and caspase-3 has been severally identified as a key mediator of the apoptotic process in mammalian cells, including neurons [55, 71]. Chen and Lane [72] reported apoptosis as a mechanism by which the MHV (the murine analogue of HCoV) induced neuronal death in mice brain.",

Lending support to this hypothesis, three cytokines often associated with immunopathology, IL-1, tumour necrosis factor alpha and IL-6 [26], are all upregulated in the brains of CoV-infected mice [27]. Although the exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV infection induces production of IL-6 in neurons is unknown, SARS-CoV products, such as the N protein, may directly induce IL-6 [74]. Alternatively, IL-6 production may be a normal consequence of a highly productive neuronal infection or may be induced by another inflammatory mediator, such as IL-1 or tumour necrosis factor alpha [26] also released in the CNS infected with SARS-CoV [27]. A high level of IL-6 leads to progressive neurological disorders with neurodegeneration, and subsequently cognitive decline [48]. Xu et al. [64] described a patient who developed progressive neurological symptoms starting at day 28 after onset. Autopsy of the patient\u2019s brain showed the presence of SARS-CoV and some pathological signs of neuronal necrosis [64]. Netland et al. [26] suggested autophagy as a non-inflammatory mechanism by which SARS-CoV induces neuronal loss in SARS-CoV-infected K18-hACE2 mice.",

Although it is widely accepted that human coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and the novel SARS-CoV-2 are usually confined to the respiratory tract, and mostly result in respiratory diseases, this review has highlighted studies to demonstrate neuroinvasive potential and potential neurological consequences of human coronaviruses. This review also discusses the behavioural and structural alterations brought about by the coronavirus neuro-infection, while also highlighting the possible mechanisms by which these viruses may induce neuronal death. Most studies reviewed here have focused on previously identified coronaviruses; however, given the similarity between the novel SARS-CoV-2 and earlier coronaviruses, this review demonstrates strong neurological implications for the novel virus. Therefore, understanding the underpinning mechanisms of neuroinvasion and interaction of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2 with the nervous system is essential to evaluate potentially pathological consequences and to design novel diagnostic and intervention strategies.",
