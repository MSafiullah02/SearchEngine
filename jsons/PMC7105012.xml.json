Unofficially, R. crenulata has been used as a fever reducer, sedative, and astringent and has been reported to show antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and liver toxicity protection activities (Choe et al., 2012, Kwon et al., 2006, Wu et al., 2009, Zou et al., 2015). Recently, researchers have reported that R. crenulata has additional beneficial effects, including antioxidant activity (Kanupriya et al., 2005) and protection against neuron damage (Mook-Jung et al., 2002). The main components mediating these effects are salidroside and tyrosol.",

In products with more than one substance, it is difficult to optimize the appropriate component ratios during mixture experiments because the substances often bind to each other to produce independent effects or interact to form a single product. The mixture design method is an experiment used to identify substances that exhibit significant effects on the targeted dependent variable and results in maximum or minimum reaction in mixture extract experiments; this method is also commonly used to determine the optimum mixing ratio (Cornell, 1990).",

The experimental procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee for the Experimental Use of Animals at Yanbian University (Yanji, Jilin, China). The mice were randomly divided into four groups (10 mice in each group). From days 1 to 30, the four different groups of mice were orally treated the following: control group, saline; OMRE groups, 100 or 200 mg/kg body weight OMRE; and positive control group, 100 mg/kg body weight CVT-E002 (an immunostimulatory polysaccharide-rich extract of the root of North American ginseng [P. quinquefolius]) (Biondo, Goruk, Ruth, O\u2019Connell, & Field, 2008), daily. At 24 h after the last administration, mice were weighed and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The spleens were immediately removed and weighed. The spleen index was calculated as the spleen weight divided by the body weight. Spleen samples were used for splenocyte proliferation.",

To determine the optimum mixing ratios of R. crenulata, A. membranaceus, and P. quinquefolia, a reaction optimization tool was used in the mixture design. The optimization technique in the mixture design is a method to find the optimum level of factors by gradually moving towards the optimized direction through calculation of response variable values for the experimental point at each stage. By setting extract yields and amounts of NO and IL-6 produced by macrophages to the maximum, the determined reaction equation from the model was used to predict the satisfying numerical point. The predicted optimum values of the mixing ratio to obtain complex extracts with high extract yield, as well as immune enhancing activity, were 49.5% for R. crenulata, 26.1% for A. membranaceus, and 24.4% for P. quinquefolia, and the predicted response values based on the determined mixing ratios were 31.5% yield, 13.4% NO production, and 6.1% IL-6 production (Fig. 3\n). To verify the predicted response values, extracts, referred to as the OMRE consisting of 50% R. crenulata, 26% A. membranaceus, and 24% P. quinquefolia were prepared, and 35.3% yield, 14.7% NO production, and 6.6% IL-6 production were obtained. In order to identify the substances that significantly affected the response variables and optimum mixing ratios to satisfy the response variables, we used mixture design. Our findings could be used to develop functional drinks with high added value in the food industry. Moreover, R. crenulata, which has various physiological activities, could show greater value in improving food quality by mixing R. crenulata with A. membranaceus and P. quinquefolia to develop a complex extract. Recent studies have reported the optimum mixing ratios for Petasites japonicus, Luffa cylindrica, and Houttuynia cordata mixture to treat respiratory diseases (Jeong et al., 2015), and a mixture design has been used to optimizing the mixing ratio in Chinese quince jam production (Lee & Jang, 2009).",

            "text": "The spleen is an important immune organ and is critical for the nonspecific immunity of organisms (Chen, Tang, Wang, Sun, & Liang, 2012). Immune stimulators can increase spleen weights (Chen et al., 2012). Here, mice were treated with the OMRE by oral administration at 100 or 200 mg/kg, and the effects of OMRE on the spleen index are presented in Fig. 4\nA. When the mice were treated with OMRE at 200 mg/kg, the spleen index was significantly increased compared with that of the control group. The spleen index tended to increase when used at the lower dose as well (100 mg/kg); however, this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 4A). CVT-E002, an immunostimulatory polysaccharide-rich extract from the roots of North American ginseng (P. quinquefolium), was used as a positive control (Biondo et al., 2008). The proliferation of splenic cells is one of the most important steps in the activation of cell-mediated or humoral immunity (Zhao, Li, Luo, & Wu, 2006). Splenic cell proliferation in mice treated with OMRE is presented in Fig. 4B and C. Con A and LPS were used to stimulate T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation, respectively (Cerqueira et al., 2004). T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation was increased in the OMRE-treated group compared with that in the negative control group. Splenic cell proliferation capacity has been widely used as a method to screen for new immune stimulators because cell division and DNA synthesis can be stimulated by various antigens, mitogens, and cytokines (Kruisbeek, Shevach, & Thornton, 2004). In this study, administration of OMRE increased the mitogen-stimulated proliferation of splenic cells in mice. These results suggested that OMRE activated mouse lymphocytes.",

            "text": "OMRE treatment significantly increased IL-10 cytokine levels in Con A-induced T lymphocytes by stimulation of T cells (Fig. 5\nA). IL-10 may act in an autocrine manner to suppress antigen-presenting cell (APC) pro-inflammatory responses, act directly on effector T cells to limit their proliferation and function, or promote the differentiation of naive T cells into regulatory populations (Couper, Blount, & Riley, 2008). In LPS-induced B-lymphocyte supernatants, the amount of IL-10 was increased by OMRE treatment (Fig. 5A). Most cytokines with B-cell growth factor activity in vitro, including IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10, are also able to induce partial differentiation of B cells into plasma cells secreting Ig (Banchereau & Rousset, 1992). IL-10 is the most potent B-cell differentiation factor, inducing complete differentiation of B cells into mature plasma cells in association with CD40 activation (Rousset et al., 1992). As shown in Fig. 5B, treatment with OMRE at 200 mg/kg significantly increased IL-6 production in Con A- or LPS-stimulated splenocytes supernatants. IL-6 stimulates the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and plays a central role in fever and acute phase responses (Muraguchi et al., 1988, Sica et al., 1990). IL-6 is secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune responses and promotes T-cell proliferation, T helper cell differentiation, and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity by CD81 cells. Moreover, IL-6 synergizes with IL-1\u03b2 in the development of cell-mediated immune responses (Houssiau and Van Snick, 1992, Okada et al., 1988).",

As shown in Fig. 6\nA, anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation significantly enhanced T-cell proliferation compared to the unstimulated control (CD3\u2212/CD28\u2212). Proliferation significantly increased when anti-CD3/CD28-activated T cells were treated with OMRE (50, 100, or 200 \u03bcg/mL). These results suggest that OMRE enhanced the proliferative capability of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells. Since OMRE increased the proliferation of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells, we investigated whether OMRE could affect IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 production in these cells. OMRE significantly increased the production of IL-2 (Fig. 6B) and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 6C), the hallmark cytokines for Th1-type in anti-CD3/CD28- stimulated T cell.",
