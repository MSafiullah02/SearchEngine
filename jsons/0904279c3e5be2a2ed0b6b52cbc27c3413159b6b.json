Uveitis is common in these cats. It was the aim of this study to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of an immunocytochemical assay (ICC) in aqueous humor of cats suspected of having FIP. Animals studied The study included 26 cats with immunohistochemically confirmed FIP and 12 control cats for which FIP was suspected due to similar clinical or laboratory changes, but which suffered from other diseases confirmed via histopathology. Procedures All aqueous humor samples were collected postmortem by paracentesis. ICC was carried out as avidin-biotin complex method. Sensitivity, specificity, and the overall accuracy including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Results Immunocytochemistry was positive in 16 of 25 cats with FIP and 2 of 11 control cats (one cat with lymphoma, one with pulmonary adenocarcinoma). Aqueous humor samples of one cat with FIP and of one control cat were excluded from statistical analysis. Sensitivity was 64.0% (95% CI: 42.5-82.0); specificity 81.8% (95% CI: 48.2-97.7); and overall accuracy 69.4% (95% CI: 51.9-83.7).

[6] [7] [8] In cats without effusion, the definitive diagnosis of FIP currently can only be achieved by invasive procedures such as laparotomy or laparoscopy to obtain biopsy samples of affected tissue for immunostaining of macrophages. [9] [10] [11] [12] Uveitis and neurological signs are often present in cats suffering from FIP without detectable body cavity effusions, 10 and FIP has been shown to be the most common infectious cause of uveitis in cats. 13 In cats suffering from FIP without significant effusions, ocular and/or neurological signs are present in about 60% of the affected cats. In contrast, if effusion is present, ocular and/or neurological signs occur in less than 9%. 10 More recently, however, it has been discussed that eye involvement might actually be underestimated, as 29% of cats confirmed to have FIP showed eye involvement. 11 The most common ocular signs seen in cats with FIP are uveitis and chorioretinitis. [14] [15] [16] A mixed uveal inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of neutrophils and mononuclear inflammatory cells can usually be seen histologically. 17 Aqueous humor is commonly obtained in cats with uveitis for cytology but is often nondiagnostic in cats with infectious uveitis.

Previous studies on ICC or immunofluorescence using effusion or CSF have reported higher sensitivities of 85-100%. [6] [7] [8] One explanation that not all cats with FIP were positive in ICC is a low number of macrophages in the examined specimens. Especially in cats without uveitis the number of macrophages in the aqueous humor can be low, but could be much higher if inflammation is present. Given the fact that only one of the cats with positive ICC results on aqueous humor samples showed clinical signs or histopathological changes indicative of uveitis, the sensitivity appears rather high when compared to sensitivity of immunostaining in other material, such as effusion. Nevertheless, aqueous humor cytology was abnormal in all of the cats with FIP for which cytological data was available and in 11/12 of the control cats, regardless of whether they showed signs of uveitis. All of the control cats suffered from severe diseases, such as neoplasia, commonly associated with inflammation, which can explain their abnormal aqueous humor. Apparently, inflammatory and neoplastic cells originating from other parts of the body are able to cross the bloodaqueous barrier, even without the presence of uveitis. A sufficient number of macrophages was detected cytologically in 8/9 cats with FIP with false negative ICC results. Thus, lack of cellularity is unlikely responsible for the false-negative results.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 183, "end": 186, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 187, "end": 190, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 191, "end": 194, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FIP"}, {"text": "All aqueous humor samples were obtained postmortem after the cats were euthanized or died due to disease progression, which is a limitation to the present study. It is possible that antemortem paracentesis would lead to a better diagnostic utility of the ICC. Some degradation of macrophages might have occurred at the time of sampling. Antemortem paracentesis therefore might lead to a higher sensitivity of the ICC. Further explanations for a low sensitivity are a competitive binding of FCoV in immune complexes by circulating antibodies. Also the use of a monoclonal antibody in the staining protocol could be a reason, and a polyclonal antibody conjugate might have increased sensitivity (but concurrently decreased specificity).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FIP"}, {"text": "Two aqueous humor samples were considered nondiagnostic, as adequate evaluation was not possible owing to the absence of a sufficient number of cells on the slides. It is possible that the aqueous humor already did not contain a large number of cells upon sampling. Additionally, processing of the samples during ICC staining could have further decreased the number of adequate cells upon the slides. Potentially, fixation of the cellular material on the slides could increase cellularity of the ICC slides and further studies should compare and evaluate different fixation methods to avoid low cellularity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FIP"}, {"text": "As aqueous humor was collected postmortem in the present study, a 22-G needle was used for paracentesis to increase the amount of sample material and facilitate the collection. If performed antemortem, 27-to 29-G needles are usually used to reduce the risk of ocular damage. 20 The use of the larger needle could have resulted in improved cell retrieval and reduced cell disruption which might be a problem in antemortem samples. This is a limitation of the present study. Another limitation is the fact that no control cats with uveitis were included, and future studies are required to compare this new method in cats with and without uveitis by taking antemortem samples. Additionally, ophthalmological examination was not routinely performed in all of the cats, and only a relatively small number of cats was included in each group. Another limitation of this study is the fact that only four cats with FIP did not have effusions. Therefore, the usefulness of ICC in the diagnosis of FIP in cats without effusion cannot be determined and further studies should be performed in cats without effusion. Finally, the present study would have been enhanced by the inclusion of a RT-PCR assay using aqueous humor samples. Possibly, RT-PCR would have been useful in the clarification of the origin of the positive immunostaining in the two cats without histopathologically confirmed FIP and in the equivocal samples.
