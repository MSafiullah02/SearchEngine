            "text": "If necessary, the first step of sample procession is homogenization (physical, e.g., homogenizer, mortar and pestle, freeze-thaw cycles; or enzymatic techniques, e.g., salt solution, detergents, alkaline lysis), centrifugation of the sample and filtration of the supernatant (through 0.22 and 0.45 \u00b5m pore membranes) to remove nonviral nucleic acids (i.e., host cellular debris and bacteria). The filtrates can be treated with a mixture of DNases and RNases to further reduce background nucleic acids originating from the host cells and bacteria. The method chosen in this step depends on the physical properties and other characteristics of the sample type (Datta et al., 2015, Mokili et al., 2012, Shah et al., 2014, Vo and Jedlicka, 2014). Following sample homogenization and reduction of the amount of debris and background nucleic acids, viral particles can be concentrated at various efficacies. Commonly used methods include tangential-flow filtration, polyethylene glycol precipitation, and ultracentrifugation. Density gradient ultracentrifugation using cesium chloride gradient provides highly purified virus particles. Concerning the step of viral nucleic acid extraction, the picture is more complex. Viral particles are disrupted by using \u201clysis buffer,\u201d which may contain chaotropic acids (e.g., guanidine hydrochloride), detergents (sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100), and/or proteases (e.g., proteinase K). During the subsequent separation phase, the nucleic acids could be isolated from other components. This can be done by liquid\u2013liquid extraction or liquid\u2013solid extraction. During the liquid phase extraction different types of alcohol are used (e.g., phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, isopropanol, etc.). The solid phase extraction may include one of the following procedures: gel filtration, where nucleic acid is separated through gel matrix (e.g., Sephadex), ion exchange chromatography (e.g., anion exchange resin, DEAE-C), and affinity chromatography (silica surface, paramagnetic beads). In general, liquid\u2013solid extraction methods use less hazardous chemicals and provide increased throughput. Various formats have been marketed providing flexible, fast, and scalable viral nucleic acid extraction (Datta et al., 2015; Thatcher, 2015; Thurber et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The amount of extracted nucleic acids is often too low for sequencing on available next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms; in such a case the amplification of viral nucleic acids is inevitable. Sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) is among the most common amplification methods (Reyes and Kim, 1991). Initially this method was carried out by starting with restriction digestion and followed by ligation of an asymmetric primer or adaptors to both ends of the DNA molecules. By using a primer complementary to the ligated oligonucleotide, the nucleic acid fragments present in the sample could be amplified by PCR. Since then the original method has been modified to achieve more effective enrichment of nucleic acids or identification of viruses, such as DNase-SISPA and Virus discovery based on cDNA-AFLP. Another widely used method is random PCR. It uses a single primer with a known sequence at 5\u2032 end and with a random hexamer or heptamer sequence at 3\u2032 end in the first reaction. After that, the second PCR reaction is executable with a specific primer complementary to the defined 5\u2032 of the first random primer. To amplify circular DNA viral genomes, rolling circle amplification is an alternative option. This method requires short oligonucleotide primers composed of random sequences and polymerase enzyme with strand displacement activity (e.g., bacteriophage \u03d529 DNA polymerase). Another \u03d529 DNA polymerase-based method is the multiple displacement amplification. These techniques are often called whole genome amplification methods (Bexfield and Kellam, 2011, Blomstrom, 2011, Delwart, 2007).",

In 1977, Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert invented a new protocol (Maxam-Gilbert sequencing or chemical sequencing), which is based on chemical cleavage of the radiolabelled bases and subsequent separation of the resulting DNA fragments by electrophoresis. This method, however, has not become widely adopted. Finally, in 1977, Sanger et al. accomplished the method of DNA sequencing which ultimately led to the development of the \u201cdideoxy method\u201d or chain-termination sequencing technique. This process\u2014which definitively amended the progress of DNA sequencing technology\u2014depends on the application of dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) to cause base-specific termination of primed DNA synthesis. Initially, the radio-labeled fragments were separated by denaturating polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. These days the technique is coupled with fluorescence and capillary electrophoresis-based sequencers.",

Initially, laboratory methods of viral metagenomics relied on molecular cloning of amplified genomic fragments coupled with Sanger sequencing of hundreds to thousands of individual clones (Allander et al., 2005, Finkbeiner et al., 2008). Collectively, the major advantages of this technology are the long read lengths and the excellent resolution of sequence repeats and homopolymer regions. The drawbacks include the limited throughput and the relatively high per base sequencing cost (Hutchison, 2007, Schuster, 2008).\n",

During the process, pyrophosphate synthesis is measured with the utilization of chemiluminescent method. In brief, when a nucleotide is incorporated into the DNA chain, pyrophosphate is released (Fig. 2.2\n). The Adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase converts pyrophosphate into ATP, which is used as a substrate for luciferase, hence visible light is detected and measured (chemiluminescence) with charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The process is reinitiated by adding the next complementary dNTP in the next dispensing cycle (Heather and Chain, 2016, Hutchison, 2007, Kulski, 2016). The method has disadvantages, including the high error rates in homopolymer repeats, the appearance of indels (insertions, deletions), as well as the time consuming sample preparation protocols. In contrast, the number of sequencing reactions and reads dramatically extended, the quality of data improved by reducing cross-talk between reaction wells, and the system was miniaturized (PicoTiterPlates) enabling the reduction of reaction volume. Furthermore, this platform provides long read lengths (400 bp to 1 kb) (Heather and Chain, 2016, Kulski, 2016, Metzker, 2010, Schuster, 2008).",

            "text": "With Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing a new paradigm in next generation sequencing was established in 2010. The sequencing technology exploits the fact that addition of a dNTP to a DNA polymer releases an H+ ion and changes the pH of the solution that is proportional to the numbers of incorporated nucleotides. If there are two identical bases on the DNA strand, the sequencing chip will record two identical bases. If the next nucleotide is not a match, no base will be recorded. This process can be detected by a sequencing chip, which functions like a small solid-state pH meter. Overall, the method provides shorter workflow and simpler, faster, and more affordable sequencing to users. Life Technologies offers several next generation sequencing systems and sequencing chips: Ion Proton with Ion PI Chip, Ion S5 System with Ion 520, 530 540 Chip Kit, Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) with the Ion 314, 316, 318 Chip. The read lengths (200\u2013400 bp), the accuracy (99%) and the run time (2\u20137 hours) are similar, but there are differences in the output (reads per run ranges from 0\u20135 to 60\u201380 million reads/run; with up to 2\u201310 Gb per run). The major disadvantages of this technology are biases in detection of insertions, deletions, and homopolymer sequences. However, there are numerous advantages like stable quality of sequencing, better GC depth distribution, higher map rate, relatively longer read lengths, and fastness [Kulski, 2016; Liu et al., 2012; Mardis, 2013; <https://www.thermofisher.com/hu/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing.html> (accessed: 2018.09.22)].",

When a fluorescent nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA chain, the enzyme cleaves off the fluorescent dye. The emitted signals are detectable in real time by a CCD camera placed inside the machine. The other key point of the method is the usage of zero-mode waveguides (ZMW), which are fine wells in a metallic film covering a chip. Each ZMW contains single DNA polymerase attached to their bottom and single DNA target. This allows the observation of a fluorescent labeled single molecule in real time, kept apart from the signal noise background (other fluorescent labeled molecules). With this new approach the read length has dramatically increased with maximum read lengths up to >100 kbp. A major drawback is the relatively high error rate (single pass accuracy ~86%, but the consensus accuracy >99.99%), which stems mostly from indel errors.",

They are suitable for the detection and quantification of biological and chemical molecules. During the sequencing, a voltage is applied across the membrane continuously, causing ionic current.

The read sequences are commonly stored in FASTQ file format or in the native raw data file formats depending on the sequencing instrument and the associated onboard software. This step is followed by quality control of the reads (searching for sequence errors and artifacts, platform-specific error profiles, etc.), then trimming (cleavage of adapters, tags, primers), and the alignment and assembly of contigs (mapping to reference sequences or de novo assembly). In general, there are several assembly tools and software (e.g., Geneious, Velvet, and ABySS); but nowadays viral genome specific genome assemblers, such as VICUNA, Viral Assembly Pipeline (VrAP), V-FAT, AV454, RIEMS, and metagenome assemblers like Omega, Genovo, MEGAHIT, MetaSpades, MetaVelvet are also available (Holzer and Marz, 2017, Rose et al., 2016, Roy et al., 2018).\nDuring de novo assembly, there is no available reference sequence for alignment; this technique is key to identify novel virus genome sequences. The next step is genome identification and annotation [open reading frame (ORF), the coding sequence, repeated elements, untranslated regions, etc.], search for single nucleotide polymorphism and insertion/deletion, and comparative sequence analysis. Commercially available analysis tools (e.g., CLCBIO Genomic Workbench, Avadis NGS, and Softgenetics Nextgene) offer user-friendly solutions for this purpose. Virus-specific data bases are useful to collect relevant information on virus families and also sequence data for subsequent taxonomic and phylogenetic classification (Holzer and Marz, 2017, Kulski, 2016, Rose et al., 2016, Roy et al., 2018).

In clinical diagnostics, the recognition and the treatment of novel and rare pathogens is a real challenge. With the new technical inventions, this problem could be solved. Another application is the real-time investigation of outbreaks caused by viral pathogens and the prevention of potential epidemics. The environmental monitoring of pathogens by viral metagenomics may also have an important role in efforts of infectious disease control. In this case, the quick reaction, the regulation, and risk assessment based on laboratory confirmed evidence is very important. Moreover, broad-range detection and identification of novel viruses or novel types of known viruses will be able to help us to broaden our range of vision, facilitate protection against viral agents, and understand viral diversity (Table 2.1\n). The origin of novel viruses or novel variants is diverse, one of the potential sources is the cross-species transfer, hence surveying of potential reservoirs and characterizing the intra-host variability is necessary (Barzon et al., 2013, Bibby, 2013, Capobianchi et al., 2013, Mokili et al., 2012). In several cases, the co-occurrence of the newly identified virus with a disease symptom does not proof the causation, although experimental and epidemiological verification is required. To provide disease causation, Mokili et al. proposed the metagenomics Koch\u2019s postulates.

Similarly, a novel virus alike Chimpanzee stool-associated circular ssDNA virus (ChiSCV) was discovered on 454 pyrosequencing platform and presumptively named pig stool-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV) (Sachsenr\u00f6der et al., 2012). In yet another study, a novel virus was discovered in the fecal samples of healthy piglets, on sequencer Illumina Hiseq 2000, and was named swine pasivirus 1 (SPaV1) (Sauvage et al., 2012). Pestiviruses are prevalent among varied animal species ranging from all farm animals to wild animals, like wild boar and deer species. They were initially discovered through the classical and conventional methods. Now their detection rate has increased with the aid of metagenomics. In the United States, recently discovered pestiviruses have been through the metagenomic studies, under the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus metagenomic sequencing project (Hause et al., 2015). One of the novel viruses discovered was named atypical porcine pestivirus. Through critical and various cross-validating analysis, identity of a novel virus is set. Later, this virus was found to be widespread in European countries as well (Beer et al., 2017, de Groof et al., 2016, Postel et al., 2016, Schwarz et al., 2017). Metagenomic analysis deciphers for a varied and extended viral flora from single-stranded RNA to circular DNA viruses.",

This strain was associated with decreased milk production and a conclusion was drawn for its derivation from multiple reassortments among Japanese cattle. Various diverse genotypes have been discovered in Japanese cattle in VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 genes of rotavirus B (RVB). Their identity was found to be between around 52%\u201368% between human, murine, and porcine RVBs. Analysis and comparative studies were revealed for the independent evolutions of bovine RVBs (Hayashi-Miyamoto et al., 2017). In the Asia-Pacific region, a number of picornaviruses have been discovered in various hosts like bats, canines, felines, etc., in quick succession.

            "text": "Several advances have been gathered using sequence-independent assays and deep sequencing for caliciviruses (ssRNA+) of pets. Caliciviruses include important enteric pathogens of humans (noroviruses and sapoviruses) (Lindsay et al., 2015, Oka et al., 2015) and animal viruses (Harrison et al., 2007, Radford et al., 2009, Ohlinger et al., 1990). In 2008 noroviruses were first discovered in dogs (Martella et al., 2008). The virus was genetically related to Alphatron-like (GIV) human noroviruses. In the subsequent years, norovirus strains genetically heterogeneous have been reported in several countries (Mesquita et al., 2010, Martella et al., 2009, Tse et al., 2012) and exposure of dogs to noroviruses has been confirmed in several epidemiological investigations (Di Martino et al., 2017, Caddy et al., 2013, Mesquita et al., 2014). In 2011 the genome of a canine sapovirus was reconstructed in a metagenomic study in the United States (Li et al., 2011). Similar sapoviruses have been identified later on in Italy (Bodnar et al., 2016) and Japan (Soma et al., 2015). Also, specific antibodies and age-related patterns of prevalence have been identified in dogs, confirming that the virus is common in dogs (Melegari et al., 2018). In 2015, a novel vesivirus was reported in Italy (Martella et al., 2015). The canine vesivirus was highly related to caliciviruses found as contaminants of Chinese hamster ovary cells in the United States and Europe (strain 2117-like) and distantly related to the prototype canine calicivirus strain 48. The virus was detected at a low frequency in household dogs but at a high frequency in kennel dogs. Genome sequencing of old (1960s\u201370s) canine calicivirus isolates in the United States has characterized the isolates as either 2117-like or strain 48-like vesiviruses (Binn et al., 2018). Also, an acute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis outbreak caused by vesiviruses has been described in the United States in 2015 (Renshaw et al., 2018). The outbreak affected 11 dogs following a stay in a pet housing facility and four dogs died.",

The near complete genome sequences of three astrovirus strains, D1, D2, and D3, were obtained (Zhang et al., 2014a, Zhang et al., 2014b), with strain D1 being distantly related to other feline astroviruses (Lau et al., 2013, Ng et al., 2014). In the same study, the nearly complete genomes of two bocaparvovirus strains, FBD1 and FBD2, were retrieved (Zhang et al., 2014a, Zhang et al., 2014b), with FBD1 representing a novel parvovirus species (Lau et al., 2012a, Cotmore et al., 2014). Also, a cyclovirus (ssDNA) (family Circoviridae) strain, FD, was identified. Upon sequence and phylogenetic analysis, the virus differed from other cyclovirus species (Zhang et al., 2014a, Zhang et al., 2014b). Cycloviruses have been found recently in different biological samples from a number of host species, including mammals and insects (Li et al., 2010a, Li et al., 2010b, Ge et al., 2011, Rosario et al., 2011, Dayaram et al., 2013, Padilla-Rodriguez et al., 2013, Phan et al., 2014).",

Reports of OPXV infections in animals and humans have been increasing during the last few decades leading to the perception of an increasing risk for humans (Vorou et al., 2008). In cats, there are a number of reports of poxvirus infections, but the causative agent has been characterized mostly as cow OPXV (Schaudien et al., 2007, Sch\u00f6niger et al., 2007, Schulze et al., 2007, Johnson et al., 2009, Kaysser et al., 2010, Herder et al., 2011). The first full genome sequences of two feline ortopoxviruses were obtained by NGS approach (Dabrowski et al., 2013) from strains collected as part of the routine diagnostic work at the German consultant laboratory for poxviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two cat strains clustered into cowpox clade. Later, five novel feline OPXV whole genome nucleotide sequences were generated by NGS from a collection of isolates obtained from several localities in the United Kingdom and Norway (Mauldin et al., 2017). Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the presence of five different clades (A\u2013E) from cowpox. More recently, a cat with multicentric nodular ulcerative dermatitis was found positive for OPXV (Lanave et al., 2018). The virus differed from cowpoxes common in cats and was grouped with an OPXV strain identified from captive macaques in Italy (Cardeti et al., 2017), related to ectromelia viruses (Chen et al., 2003, Mendez-Rios et al., 2012, Mavian et al., 2014).",

Eleven out of 31 pathogens had not been previously detected despite being subjected to standard diagnostic methods.

In these studies, the overwhelming majority of the viral sequences detected by NGS are unknown, while among the viruses identified, bacteriophages (order Caudovirales) infecting a wide range of microbial hosts (Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and members of the family Phycodnaviridae (large eukaryotic phytoplankton viruses) showed the highest abundance. For example in a study on the virome of the marine environment in Goseong Bay (Korea), the BLAST searches showed that only 0.74% of the sequences were associated with known viruses, and 87% of these known sequences were originating from bacteriophages and only 13% showed homology to viruses of eukaryotes (Hwang et al., 2016). Nonetheless, already known DNA and RNA viruses of fish were also detected in these studies, these viral sequences were similar to those of members of diverse families, such as Nodoviridae, Retroviridae, Iridoviridae (Zeigler Allen et al., 2017), and Alloherpesviridae (Wood-Charlson et al., 2015, Hwang et al., 2016).\n",

The results showed that a majority of the viral sequences do not have any homologs in public databases, hence they could not be assigned to any taxa. The minority, the assigned viruses, were prevailed by dsDNA viruses, especially bacteriophages. However, sequences associated with emerging, important viruses of fish and shrimp were also detected, for example, the koi herpesvirus (KHV), infectious spleen, and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), white spot syndrome virus Thus, drawing attention to the fact, that ballast water of cargo ships could be an important vector for the transport of nonnative species to new aquatic environments including viruses (Kim et al., 2015a, Kim et al., 2015b).",

For example, the complete genomes of all members of the genus Cyprinivirus (Cyprinid herpesviruses, CyHV-1, -2, -3 and Anguillid herpesvirus, AngHV-1) were sequenced by NGS, their genome sizes proved to be the largest among herpesviruses (248\u2013295 kbp). Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (KHV) is the most ill-famed among the above mentioned viruses, revealing its complete genome was necessary for developing reliable diagnostic methods (PCR, qPCR) and designing DNA vaccine for KHV (El-Matbouli et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2014). In another study, the deep sequencing of poly(A) RNA of the formerly mentioned AngHV-1 was carried out, providing the first data about the transcriptome of a fish herpesvirus. They found surprisingly lots of RNA splicing, and a low level (1.5/%) of antisense transcription in predicted protein-coding regions unlike in the genome of mammalian herpesviruses (Van Beurden et al., 2012). Another herpesvirus genomes belonging to the genus Ictalurivirus were also sequenced, namely the Ictalurid herpesvirus 2 (Borzak et al., 2018) and the Acipenserid herpesvirus 2 (Doszpoly et al., unpublished). These viruses have a significantly shorter genome (143\u2013165 kbp) than that of the cypriniviruses.\n",

Another poxvirus (salmon gill poxvirus) was reported from salmon (Salmo salar), and its full genome was determined by NGS using the organs of diseased fish.
