In that paper we adopted the similar method as Imai's (2) , which was used to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei, China. The model provided a rough range estimation about the epidemic size and has been recognized by peers as a valid method in the early stage of an epidemic (3) (4) (5) . The accumulated evidence coincides with early estimation in scales.",

A lower estimation of total infected cases is possible under the scenario in which a smaller catchment population is linked to those airports. Nevertheless, there are no solid evidence which specific scenario would be the reality now. Thus, we listed results under all scenarios.",

Some social studies may be helpful to determine which is more reasonable. The report from Statistical center of Iran (6) supports that over 25% of the whole population live in rural area. However, according to the same reference (6), population size of the age group 1-14 is around 4% larger in rural areas, compared to the urban areas. This situation is likely to be a factor in reducing the onset of infection symptoms among rural population, since most of COVID-19 patients were aged from 30 to 79 (87%) (7) . Rural areas may be less dense compared to urban areas which is likely to result in decreased average number of effective contacts. Also, it is likely that there are not as many tests available for the rural population. Hence, overall, lower prevalence of infection in rural areas does not strongly reject the assumption that flight passengers are distributed homogeneously among rural and urban population.",

Thus, the probability is low. Meanwhile, according to the WHO Situation Report, the likely places of exposure for these 5 cases are outside reporting country and outside China (8) (9) (10) . It was difficult for Chinese passengers to use Iran as the connection for their international flights since Iran suspended all flights to and from China on 31 January 2020 (11). In addition, Qom is a significant destination of pilgrimage. Given the epidemic situation in Qom at the early stage of outbreak, it is likely that some COVID-19 cases were exported to other counties and regions. Based on the current information (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) and research (15) , it is reasonable to presume these cases exported from Iran were infected in Iran. If more laboratory evidence provided that these cases are infected outside Iran, results will be change.",
