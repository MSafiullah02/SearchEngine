This results in a greater spread and a higher raw number of deaths. 2 In Italy, the case fatality rate has been high, with 16,654 deaths out of 136,110 positive cases as of April 9, 2020, with health care professionals being at highest risk for infection, accounting for around 10% of positive cases (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0; https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/ sars-cov-2-sorveglianza-dati).",

In Italy, there is a high rate of health care worker-related infection leading to self-isolation, hospitalization, and critical care admission, with its consequences on health care delivery and the well-being of the workforce. One of the key concerns with the SARS-CoV-2 virus is that the modality for transmission remains uncertain, as \"airborne diffusion cannot be ruled out at this stage.\" 3 Compounding this uncertainty is the potential for the virus to variably survive on different surfaces and a lack of vaccine or specific treatment. 2 There are some suggestions that the virus should be treated on bio-safety level 4, 4 which is obviously not feasible in pandemic settings.",

Further, we also highlight the importance of planning (communication in PPE could be particularly challenging) and of hemodynamic optimization, if time is available. We strongly advocate for the conduct of rapid sequence intubation with full-dose neuromuscular blockade to minimize the risk of coughing and the use of videolaryngoscopy, possibly with separate screen, as well as using a preloaded bougie or stylet as routine adjunct to maximize first-pass success. 2 Any AGP should be avoided, ideally including mask ventilation. Unfortunately, hypoxemia is a hallmark of COVID-19 patients requiring tracheal intubation, and patients do not tolerate the cessation of oxygen supplementation or apnea well. Conventional preoxygenation might be difficult and relatively ineffective; thus, we usually discontinue already ongoing noninvasive ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), turning the ventilator off and slowly removing facemask starting from the inferior edge (toward the patient's feet) to depressurize the circuit before proceeding with tracheal intubation. Should ventilation be needed, we advocate that it should be gently provided with Mapleson C (Waters; Covidien, Mirandola, Italy) circuit with a double Airway Management in COVID-19: In the Den of the Beast ",
