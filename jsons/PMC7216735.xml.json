The American College of Chest Physicians/American Thoracic Society (ACCP/ATS) clinical practice guideline (CPG) on liberation from MV suggests a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with inspiratory pressure support as the preferred technique; however, this recommendation is based on limited evidence [1, 2]. Moreover, the majority of parameters used to determine whether SBT has been successful are physiologic variables that inconsistently predict successful liberation from MV [3\u20135]. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been proposed as a novel biomarker to help predict successful liberation from MV. To date, CPGs have not integrated evidence from studies evaluating BNP to predict successful liberation from MV.",

BNP is a natriuretic peptide released from cardiomyocytes, measured using one of the two widely available assays (NT-proBNP and BNP). The half-life of BNP is estimated to be 20 min, while the half-life of NT-proBNP is estimated at 120 min [3]. Subclinical congestion and overt pulmonary edema due to changes in left ventricular afterload may be common during a SBT. These physiologic changes may be readily detected by measuring changes in BNP [5\u20139]. Existing studies have attempted to incorporate BNP at various steps of liberation from MV. The focus of this study will be the use of BNP during a SBT.",

Development and validation of rigorous methods incorporating BNP (both BNP and NT-proBNP will be hereto referred to as BNP for the purpose of this manuscript) may augment clinician decision support and rates of successful liberation from MV and improve patient outcomes. The objective of this systematic review was to rigorously evaluate the value of BNP measurement with a SBT as a biomarker to predict liberation from MV among critically ill ICU patients. We hypothesized that BNP would add incremental predictive value for successful liberation from MV compared with standard clinical and biochemical parameters assessed during SBT.",

The other subset assessed BNP as an incremental tool in addition to SBT testing and excluded SBT failure from the analysis (group 2; Fig. 2). This was unclear in one study [20].

In studies, SBT misclassified patients in 10\u201320% of patients who subsequently failed successful liberation from MV [1, 12]. While reintubation was described as occurring without immediate difficulty, these patients had greater risk of morbidity and mortality following a failed attempt at liberation from MV [1]. Better prediction by use of alternative tests that add incremental value, such as BNP, may lead to greater confidence in clinical decision-making to extubate, reduced reintubation, and improved outcomes. This possibility has been recognized as early as 2008 in two methods of analysis: as an incremental \u201cvalue-added\u201d test during SBT [3] and as a \u201cstand-alone\u201d alternative test [5]. These two approaches were well represented in the studies included in this meta-analysis. A subset of studies (group 1, n = 8) included patients failing their SBT in the analysis of the group that failed MV liberation; this in effect assessed BNP as an alternative test to conventional SBT. This method may have decreased accuracy compared to evaluation of pooled analysis where patients who failed their SBT were excluded. A second subset of studies (group 2, n = 9) excluded patients with a failed SBT in the analysis of the MV liberation failure group. This in effect assesses BNP as an incremental test to a successful SBT. The major benefit in this case is the potential reclassification of patients for whom liberation may have been attempted but may have failed. This distinction is important to determine the optimal use of BNP in assessment for MV liberation. In our view, the two ways in which SBT failure is incorporated in the analysis should ideally be pooled and analyzed separately. However, we expected limited data and pooled them for further analysis as planned in the protocol. Similarly, the different methods of BNP measures (\u0394BNP, DeltaBNP%, BNP-pre, and BNP-post) should not be pooled, as some address a change in BNP values, whereas others only address a single value at a specific time. The only exception in which BNP measures could be pooled would be \u0394BNP and \u0394BNP% given the possibility that baseline BNP level may not be relevant in the case of substantial change occurring during a SBT.",

Similarly, due to limitation in the reporting across studies, we were unable to perform stratified analysis by potentially important subgroups, such as case-mix and type of ICU admission. We opted to combine both general ICU populations and specific ICU subgroups to capture enough data to perform the AUROC analyses. The bi-variate analysis and Moses-Littenberg analyses were unaffected, as all studies included were of a mixed ICU population. We believe that this makes our results more generalizable to mixed medical/surgical ICU practice; however, we cannot provide strong inferences on the value of BNP for MV liberation in selected ICU subgroups, as each population was represented by a single study. There are several confounders to the accuracy of BNP testing. Heart disease (and specifically depressed left ventricular ejection fraction) and kidney failure can significantly alter BNP kinetics. Unfortunately, these patient characteristics were inconsistently included or excluded across studies. In the case of kidney failure, the distinction between acute and chronic renal failure was also poor. In balance, renal function was normal in most studies, and at most mildly impaired in the rest. As for heart disease, the definitions were variable. The etiology of respiratory failure has an impact on the accuracy of BNP: delirium, traumatic brain injury, inability to clear secretions, or stridor, among others, limit the accuracy of BNP as they may not lead to a change in BNP measurements. A low number of studies that were included in this review attempted to limit this impact by excluding stridor and TBI from the analysis. Unfortunately, capturing clearance of secretions or delirium as the cause of respiratory failure is understandably difficult and was not done in any study. Another limitation is the lack of studies that directly compared the accuracy of a successful SBT by clinical indices and by BNP measure. In this instance, a patient that has passed a SBT by clinical indices may fail by BNP measure, leading to a delay in extubating a patient that would have succeeded. Unfortunately, the relative accuracies were not directly assessed in any study.",

The main issue was lack of transparency regarding blinding of physicians to the BNP test. In our opinion, this is not a critical flaw, as the decision to extubate patients was most often based on clinical SBT criteria in all studies.",

Such a stratification may help better determine targets for optimization (such as further volume de-escalation), better identification of the need for post-extubation therapies (such as high-flow oxygen therapy and BiPAP), and need for prolonged ICU observation. Clinical risk scores on this basis could be developed to aid in management of these patients after extubation.",

As such, we submit further investigation is warranted. There was insufficient data to support \u0394BNP% as a stand-alone test to conventional SBT or the use of \u0394BNP, BNP-pre, and BNP-post either as incrementally or as a stand-alone, alternate, or incremental test. Studies comparing the best use of \u0394BNP% either as an alternative or incremental tool to clinical indices during SBT as well as prospective validation of a specific threshold represent the next step in research.
