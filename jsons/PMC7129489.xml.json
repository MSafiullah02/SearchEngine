            "text": "In recent years, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been increasingly recognized as a potential cause of acute otitis media, bronchiolitis, asthma and pneumonia in children 1, 2, 3. The development of sensitive and rapid molecular techniques markedly improved the detection rate of HRV and revealed the high genetic diversity. Over 150 serotypes of HRV have been described, classified into three main species: HRV\u2010A, HRV\u2010B and HRV\u2010C 4. HRV\u2010C is the most recently discovered species and is thought to contribute more to recurrent wheezing and exacerbations of asthma compared with HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010B 1, 5. Also, recently published data suggest that HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C cause more severe illness than HRV\u2010B, with the greatest virulence during the winter 6. Currently, molecular diagnostics are increasingly integrated into routine practice, allowing detection and quantification of HRV, and also raising questions about their value in direct patient care and infection control. We performed a hospital\u2010based prospective study to determine the clinical, epidemiological and viral characteristics associated with HRV infection in children.",

Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were systematically collected from all children under 18 years of age, from whom respiratory samples were taken for the detection of 15 respiratory viruses (influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, para\u2010influenzavirus type 1\u20134, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and rhinovirus). Samples positive for HRV were further characterized by sequence analysis of the VP4/VP2 region.

All reactions were performed with Phocine Distemper Virus as an internal control in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL containing 12.5 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7 reactionmix, 0.5 \u03bcL SuperScript\u00ae III RT/Platinum\u00ae Taq mix, 0.5 \u03bcL of 1:10 Rox reference dye, 300 nm of each forward primer, 600 nm reverse primer and 100 nm of each probe, and 5 \u03bcL of genomic RNA template. Primers and probes used are listed in Table 1. The addition of this large set of primers and probes is performed in a specific reaction to avoid bias and favouring against other respiratory viruses. Our rhinovirus PCR has been optimized during recent years based on the available genetic information, in particular regarding species C. By re\u2010optimizing the assay with new primers and probes, together with the use of Invitrogen SuperScript enzymes, we detected retrospectively more HRV\u2010positive samples at a lower cycle threshold (Ct) value. To ensure that these HRVs were not enteroviruses, all samples were sequenced. We only detected HRV, eventually 99 serotypes, as well as enterovirus 68, which is genetically identical to HRV.",

In patients with a chronic respiratory condition, only the need for oxygen was predictive for HRV; cough and shortness of breath were not only associated with the detection of HRV, but also with the detection of other respiratory viruses. Thus, respiratory symptoms alone are not sufficient to predict the presence of an HRV infection.",

Adequate quantification of HRV in respiratory samples is currently limited by several factors, as addressed in recent reports 16, 17. One major limitation is the lack of a reference standard for the quantification of all HRV types. Secondly, HRV viral load is affected by the sample type and the method of collection and detection 18. Thus, although in our study no relationship between the relative amount of virus (expressed as Ct value) and the presence of clinical symptoms could be demonstrated, the interpretation of the Ct value in relation to severity of illness remains to be determined and is probably, with the current limitations in quantification of HRV, hardly feasible.",

This might be explained by concerns over getting a bacterial co\u2010infection. Indeed, antibiotic use was associated with submission of samples for bacteriological culture, assuming a suspicion of bacterial infection in those patients. However, although bacteria known to cause (secondary) respiratory infections in infants were more frequently cultured in patients with a respiratory viral infection compared with patients with no viral infection (H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae), the outcome of the bacteriological cultures did not influence the use of antibiotics. Because the collection of samples for bacteriological culture was not standardized, but dependent on the judgement of the clinician, and carried out in only a minority of patients, these results might have been biased and more studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

In our population, species HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C were detected in equal amounts, and dominated over HRV\u2010B. We observed no species\u2010specific pattern of clinical illness, except that HRV\u2010B was associated with a higher need for oxygen. Besides, patients with HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010B had to stay in the hospital significantly longer than patients with HRV\u2010C. Until now, studies that addressed the relationship between species and severity of illness reported HRV\u2010B as being the least virulent compared with HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C 6, 17. However, recently, Miller et al. also showed that patients with HRV\u2010B were more likely to require supplemental oxygen and had a longer duration of stay in the hospital 19. Also, patients with HRV\u2010B tended to have higher disease severity scores. The reason for the different observations regarding HRV\u2010B\u2010associated severity of illness is not clear. Our study and the study of Miller et al. included hospitalized children, whereas in a recent study by Lee et al., who showed a clear distinction in severity of illness between HRV\u2010A/C and HRV\u2010B, the majority of patients were not admitted to the hospital 6. Also, we observed a tendency for more chronic respiratory illness in patients with an HRV\u2010B infection, possibly explaining the higher need for oxygen. These findings may suggest that HRV\u2010B is associated with either asymptomatic carriage or mild respiratory disease, and that host factors such as pre\u2010existing pulmonary disease contribute to more serious, symptomatic respiratory illness caused by HRV\u2010B.",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed several clusters of HRV with identical sequences; in more than 25% of these clusters epidemiological information was suggestive of transmission of the virus on specific wards. Although HRV\u2010B is the least frequently found species in our study, almost 40% of HRV\u2010B infections are acquired in the hospital. This suggests that the hospital environment is for some reason more favourable for transmission of HRV\u2010B. Also, if HRV\u2010B is indeed associated with asymptomatic carriage or mild respiratory disease, this would facilitate transmission within the hospital, only causing clear respiratory symptoms in patients with pre\u2010existing pulmonary illness.",

These findings advocate the implementation of infection control measures driven by the presence of respiratory symptoms instead of the outcome of a laboratory test.

Although antiviral therapy is not yet available for patients infected with HRV, the detection and identification of these viruses could help in explaining respiratory illness. Also, identifying HRV provides opportunities for implementing timely and accurate infection control measures to prevent further transmission. Our study illustrates the value of sequence analysis not only in gaining insight into the genetic diversity of rhinoviruses, but also as a tool in defining transmission routes within the hospital and in the detection of sources of nosocomial infection.",
