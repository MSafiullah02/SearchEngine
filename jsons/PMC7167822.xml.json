Sensitization may be a predisposing factor for HRV illnesses in later life, possibly by suppressing antiviral responses 8, 19. In our study, however, there were only three aeroallergen\u2010sensitized children, but they all developed recurrent wheezing. Aeroallergen sensitization is highly specific, but not sensitive early risk marker for asthma 17, 23. The slow development of aeroallergen sensitization in general population (rarely before age 1 yr) 5, 23 decreases its value in asthma risk indices at early life and calls for better early risk factors such as HRV. Thus, our data suggest that early asthma risk indices could be improved if the HRV aetiology was included 24.",

Systemic dosing may particulary be important because it has recently been suggested that a local inflammation triggers a linkage to bone marrow from where cells potentially migrate to their different peripheral targets, for example lungs or skin 25. Although glucocorticoids preserve epithelial barrier and thereby could protect against respiratory viral infections 28, a more important mechanism may be their ability to repress the transcription of many inflammatory genes and/or their transcription factors and induce the expression of a number of anti\u2010inflammatory genes 26, 27. Moreover, glucocorticoids inhibit the HRV\u2010induced up\u2010regulation of its own receptor ICAM\u20101 (intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101, major HRV\u2010receptor) in pulmonary mucosa 29. Early administration, that is, for the first wheeze and early course of the acute illness may be a relevant factor for the long\u2010term clinical efficacy. The outcome of recurrent wheezing was almost completely fulfilled within the first 2 yr of follow\u2010up in our study.",

However, the risk of recurrent wheeze in our study was inversely dependent on age, whereas other separate cohort studies on hospitalized children with lower respiratory symptoms have suggested that the risk increases by age: the OR was 3.3 for recurrent wheeze in children with bronchiolitis aged less <12 months (median age 2 months) 3, and OR was 4.1 for asthma in school age in wheezing children aged <2 yr 1. A potential explanation for the discrepancy could be that we studied infants with wheezing only (vs. bronchiolitis with or without wheezing in other studies). Infant wheezing may truly be an important risk factor for asthma, and studies on bronchiolitis should clearly define wheezing status of the subjects. In a high\u2010risk cohort, the risk of recurrent wheezing has been markedly higher in rhinovirus\u2010affected wheezing children than in other children and increased by age from the wheezing at first year of life (OR 10) to third year of life (OR 26) 2.",

The verification of wheeze was important because the highest odds ratios for recurrent wheeze have been reported in wheezing children 1, 2, 9, 17. Ninety per cent of the primary outcomes were fulfilled by the definition of episodic wheeze which was defined slightly different from National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) 16. Here and in our previous report, we used three physician\u2010confirmed wheezing episodes within a past year according to the Finnish practice 13. Of other limitations, the study population was rather small, and we focused only on new diagnoses during the follow\u2010up according to our previous report instead of current asthma 13. Although the study design was randomized and controlled, the subgroup analyses were carried out post\u2010hoc. The risk of bias of multiple comparisons was avoided by using pre\u2010specified subgroups. Prospective intervention studies on HRV\u2010induced wheezing are challenging because virus PCR detection usually is an over\u2010night diagnosis. Upper airway samples for virus PCR analysis are considered to adequately reflect the infection status in the lower airways 30.",
