Hashimoto et al. theorized that selective nanostructuring of TiO2 surfaces would improve the hydrophilicity of the materials thereby making them photocatalytically superior [11]. Nanostructured TiO2 materials were reported to exhibit improved performance when used as electrodes for lithium-ion batteries compared to electrodes consisting of nanocrystalline anatase [12]. Nanostructured materials such as mesoporous titania have demonstrated improved photoanodic efficiency over Degussa P25 [13]. The main challenge with making practical use of nanostructured materials is in the processing of a solid coating layer on a substrate. ",

The coatings shown in Figure 2 have a rarely-seen columnar morphology composed of single crystal anatase and polycrystalline rutile columns [16]. Anatase columns appear pyramidal at the top and the rough dendritic structures are polycrystalline rutile (Figure 2). The thick robust coatings produced on stainless steel substrates exhibited high antimicrobial activity under visible light [14]. Thinner films on fused silica substrates have formal quantum efficiency 59 times higher than the commercial photocatalyst Pilkington ActivTM [17], measured with stearic acid degradation in UV light [18]. In previous work, we used ASTARTM analysis of TEM samples of TiO2 films grown on stainless steel to determine that the anatase columns were single crystals, even though they are made up of nano-plates, with A[220] columnar growth direction [14]. The properties of photocatalytic materials depend on the crystallography and morphology, but there has been no research reporting a study of nanoscale feature size in TiO2 bulk or coating materials to date.",

All crystals exhibited the characteristic anatase mille-feuille and rutile strobili nanostructures shown in Figure 2. The thickness of the plate-like mille-feuille structures was observed to depend on the coating thickness, which is controlled by the number of precursor pulses. The thickness of the mille-feuille plates in the anatase columns is of great interest because the PCA depends significantly on the nanostructure dimension and the total surface area. The competitive columnar growth of TiO2 anatase single crystals and the observed relation to nanostructure dimensions were investigated.",

            "text": "The pp-MOCVD technique is a one-step deposition process that was developed by Krumdieck et al. to coat large objects such as turbine blades with thermal barrier coatings [19]. The process works by direct injection, at timed intervals, of metered volumes of precursor solution via an ultrasonic atomizer into a continuously evacuated deposition chamber. The flash evaporation of atomized liquid in the evacuated reactor chamber produces a sharp pressure spick, and produces a well-mixed reactor condition enabling the coating of complex shaped objects. The objects or substrates are placed on a susceptor that is heated with a water-cooled Cu induction coil. The Titanium tetra-isopropoxide (TTIP) precursor is decomposed when it encounters the heated substrate and forms a macroscopically uniform coating. Solvent and reactant product vapors are evacuated into a liquid N2 cold trap. At high temperatures (>500 \u00b0C) the reactor works in the mass-transport controlled regime with high precursor-arrival rate to the substrate surface during the peak of the pressure pulse [20]. The pulsed-pressure cycle is typically 6 seconds with less than 0.5 seconds of pressure rise, and 5 seconds of pump-down [21]. The pp-MOCVD process reduces the reactor and substrate geometry effects on the deposition, making it a versatile technique to coat 3D objects. ",

Column-like morphologies of TiO2 are commonly reported for rutile TiO2 [34] and similar structures have been reported for anatase nanocrystals [35]. Microscale plated-anatase crystals were reported from aerosol CVD [36]. Anatase columns with nanoplates resembling the ones reported in this paper were reported by one other research group who used an atmospheric pressure MOCVD and TTIP + O2 reactant precursor [37]. These previous studies do not report growth rate or nanostructure dimension, but from descriptions of the processing, we believe that all are relatively rapid growth conditions. High crystal growth rates have been suggested as a factor in generating unstable steps in anatase TiO2 [38] which could be an important mechanism in the formation of the nanoplates. The pp-MOCVD flash vaporization produces high mass flux and the temperature of 525 \u00b0C is sufficient for rapid reaction of the precursor solution.",

The results in this study are consistent with the current theory. The range of thickness possible with pp-MOCVD allowed us to study the full range of competitive growth. The late stage plateau of crystal column diameter is clearly illustrated in the FIB-STEM sample. The diameter of crystals reaches a certain size where competition stops, but the thickness can continue to increase as crystal diameters remain the same. The orientation of TiO2 crystals that nucleate on the substrate is random but as the deposition progresses, the fast-growing crystal columns take over and limit the growth of the slower growing crystals. The orientation of the anatase crystals suggests the fast-growing crystals are those that have the (220) planes oriented parallel to the substrate surface [40].",

Our objective is to enhance PCA and antimicrobial activity by inducing nanoscale structure in a solid coating. The results described in this study show that the nano-plate thickness increases with thickness and number of pulses. Figure 16 shows the log transformed plate thickness measurements with film thickness for samples A-F on fused silica. Two scaling regimes are identified from best fit lines, where R2>0.96 for both. This shows that plate thickness increases as square root film thickness in the thinnest films investigated here. In thicker films, the plate thickness increases more slowly with film thickness. This is likely to be related to texture and supports the role of competitive growth in film development. We postulate that the increased column diameter provides more space for the nanostructures to grow and hence the resultant increase in their dimensions is observed. The nanoplate dimensions is observed to increase rapidly during the first 600 pulses, but beyond this the nano-dimension begins to plateau. We hypothesize that this is due to the relatively unstable thermodynamic conditions at a lower number of pulses compared to the conditions at a higher number of pulses. It could also be explained by the competitive columnar crystal growth. As the column diameter of the crystals increases, we also observe that each plate has feather-like nanostructures at the edges. This has not been investigated here and high resolution TEM imaging would be required to carry out a similar analysis on the dimensions of these tertiary nanostructures.",

In that study, the two thickest films, ~1 \u03bcm and 4 \u03bcm thick, respectively, had the highest surface roughness values and the highest PCA, and correspond to samples A and D in the present work. The smallest nanoplate width, ~18 nm, was measured on sample A. The nanoplates in sample D were more than twice as thick, ~36 nm.

The authors also report that the quantity of O2 in the processing environment dictates the phase fractions of anatase and rutile [42]. As the pp-MOCVD processing takes place in a low O2 environment, the relatively sporadic appearance of rutile phase in these films could be explained. We have previously reported that the rutile columns grow on top of anatase crystals [14]. However, we have also observed that TiO2 films prepared by pp-MOCVD are composed of both anatase and rutile phases even in the early deposition stages [18]. The next stage is to study the crystallographic orientation and determine the growth conditions that favor the appearance of rutile in the films.",

The pp-MOCVD process has recently provided a processing route to produce nanostructured columnar anatase/rutile/carbon composite TiO2 coatings. An interesting mille-feuille plated nanostructure in anatase columns is investigated as one of the reasons for the observed enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The short migration path from inside the nanoplate to the large specific surface areas is key for achieving an antimicrobial coating. Surface SEM and cross-sectional STEM dimensional measurements have elucidated a relationship between the thickness of the coating and the key nano-dimension. The nano-dimension increases with the column diameter and with the thickness in a similar way as expected with competitive growth mechanisms.",

In the early stage depositions (\u2264600 pulses), the nanoplate dimension increases rapidly with the increase in the number of pulses. The samples deposited for longer durations show a weaker variability of the nanoplate dimensions with sample thickness. The variation of nanoplate dimension appears to plateau with number of pulses over 600 in the same way that column diameter approaches an apparent maximum in the thickest coatings. The relationships reported in this work can provide the basis for engineering of a practical nano-structured TiO2 coating with the enhanced photocatalytic activity provided by nanoengineering. The coating needs to be thick enough to have durability and long service life, but needs to be thin enough to keep the migration path length low. Because of the relationship described between column diameter in the surface SEM view and the nano-dimension, the quality control of the nano-engineered coating could be much more easily established than if nanoscale observations were required.",
