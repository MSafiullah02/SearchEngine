For instance, the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d pandemic, which swept around the globe in 1918, claimed the lives of more people than perished in World War I [2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 35 million individuals have succumbed to AIDS-related illnesses since the beginning of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in the early 1980s. As of 2017, nearly 36.9 million people are living with HIV worldwide [3].",

In this context, therapeutic properties of venoms for treating neurologic and cardiovascular illnesses, cancer, atopic dermatitis, diabetes, and gastrointestinal maladies have been documented since medieval times [9]. Venom-derived peptides have recently provoked great attention among newly enthused researchers, since they are not only selective and potent but also relatively innocuous as therapeutics [9, 10]. Indeed, these features together with infinite biodiversity of venom-derived peptides may revitalize flagging drug development programs.",

This uneven distribution of polar and non-polar amino acid residues gives the melittin amphipathic structure when it is folded into an \u03b1-helical configuration [21]. Melittin is composed of two \u03b1-helices connected through a flexible segment [22]. Tetrameric melittin is predominant at concentrations found in the venom sac of the honeybee, but changes in peptide concentration and ionic strength result in tetramer to monomer dissociation [23, 24]. Melittin interacts with cell membranes and induces pore formation at micromolar concentrations, thereby disturbing membrane function and triggering cell lysis [25, 26].",

The family comprises three newly separated genera including Mammarenavirus, Reptarenavirus, and Hartmanivirus. Both Reptarenavirus and Hartmanivirus infect reptilian hosts, whereas Mammarenavirus infects mammalian hosts [47]. On the basis of serological cross-reactions, genetic, and geographic relationships, the genus Mammarenavirus is further subdivided into two major serogroups: The New World and the Old World [45, 47]. Noticeably, some Old World (Lassa and Lujo) and New World (Chapare, Guanarito, Jun\u00edn, Machupo, and Sabia) arenaviruses are responsible for viral hemorrhagic fever, one of the most devastating emergent human diseases, with a fatality rate of 15\u201330% in untreated cases [48, 49]. For instance, Jun\u00edn virus (JV) causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever, a severe viral illness endemic to the humid pampas of Argentina, with roughly five million people at risk [50]. Though ribavirin is the only approved anti-viral agent for treating arenaviruses in the USA; however, it exhibits undesirable secondary reactions [32, 51]. Thus, there is exigency to develop efficient therapeutics against arenaviruses.",

Intriguingly, combinations of melittin with bee venom-derived apamin were superior against BVDV than each agent alone, highlighting that apamin potentiates anti-BVDV efficacy of melittin [33].

Unquestionably, herpes simplex viruses are one of the most pervasive pathogens among humans, afflicting up to 95% of the adult population worldwide [57, 58]. Clinical manifestations range from benign and generally self-limiting forms including cold sores and genital herpes to the rare but severe and sometimes even life-menacing infections such as herpes encephalitis. Acyclovir (ACV) and related nucleoside analogues have been successfully employed in treating HSV infections, but the treatment should be commenced as soon as possible after onset of symptoms. Furthermore, efficiency of the current anti-HSV drugs is generally limited and gives rise to only marginal improvements in lesion healing time or episode duration [59]. For this reason, there is room for more efficacious therapies.",

It is worth mentioning that wild-type HSV-1 strains usually induce a limited amount of cell fusion, while certain HSV mutants known as syn mutants lead to extensive syncytium formation [61]. Disturbance of trans-membrane ion gradients impedes HSV-1-induced cell fusion [62]. This fact together with perturbation effects of melittin on Na+, K+ pump [63] propelled researchers to explore whether melittin influences HSV-1-induced cell fusion [34]. Fusion of Vero cells infected with HSV strains (MP, syn20, and FFV3) harboring the syn1 mutation in glycoprotein K was inhibited in the presence of melittin (0.5 \u03bcM), with no evidence of cytotoxicity toward Vero cells (Table 1). By contrast, melittin (0.5 \u03bcM) failed to affect cell fusion induced by HSV strains containing mutations in glycoprotein B (tsB5 and amb 1511\u20137). In presence of melittin, binding of ouabain (a specific inhibitor of the Na+, K+ ATPase) to the Na+, K+ pump of HSV-1-infected Vero cells was drastically diminished. The peptide also reduced HSV-1 yield in Vero cells compared to untreated control. In addition, the authors found that melittin is able to obstruct HSV-1 attachment onto Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner and to hinder HSV-1 penetration into cells [34].",

Influenza viruses are the most prominent member of this family [65]. WHO has been estimated that influenza-mediated debilitating respiratory ailments occur in 3 to 5 million people annually, of whom roughly 290,000 to 650,000 succumb to influenza-related illnesses [66]. Influenza A viruses are further subtyped on the basis of two main antigenic determinants named hemagglutinin (HA; H1\u2013H16) and neuraminidase (NA; N1\u2013N9) [67]. High genetic variation rates of influenza viruses due to mutation, reassortment, and/or recombination together with the lack of effective anti-influenza agents underscore the necessity of developing novel anti-viral drugs [68].",

In this regard, 1.15 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcg/mL of melittin was sufficient for 50% reduction in plaque-forming units (PFUs) of GFP-fused influenza A (H1N1, PR8-GFP). Furthermore, CC50 of melittin was 7.66 \u00b1 0.94 \u03bcg/mL for Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells. Considering both anti-viral and cytotoxic activities, selectivity index of melittin was 6.66 (Table 2), inferring that anti-influenza activity of melittin does not emanate from cytotoxic effect of the peptide [36]. In initial stages of infection, melittin (2 \u03bcg/mL) did not interfere with both cell attachment and entry of PR8-GFP strain. When PR8-GFP strain was co-incubated with melittin (for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C), waning in viral mass was observed, as evaluated by velocity sedimentation ultracentrifugation and subsequent immunoblotting [36]. At 24 h post-infection, melittin treatment (2 \u03bcg/mL, 30 min) of PR8-GFP led to significant reduction in viral titers (5-fold, P < 0.01) and GFP expression compared to untreated PR8-GFP. These data suggest direct effect of melittin on PR8-GFP surface, prior to virus-cell attachment. Li et al. postulated that surface charge interactions between a cationic peptide from scorpion venom named Mucroporin-M1 and influenza H5N1 can diminish viral infectivity [68]. Thus, melittin may interact with phospholipid bilayer of viral envelope through electrostatic interactions and destabilize viral particles, eventually leading to virolysis.",

Permeabilization of HIV-1 envelope for synthesis of cDNA is further exemplified in a study conducted by Yong et al. [40].",

Western blot analysis demonstrated the reduction of a 31 kDa protein in melittin-treated cell extracts [41]. This protein could relate to some fragments of processed Gag/Pol precursor polyprotein or p31 integrase. Furthermore, data retrieved from C-terminal and truncated derivatives of melittin suggest that both amphipathic alpha-helical part (residues 1\u201320) and cationic amino acid residues in the C-terminal end of melittin are accounted for its anti-viral properties against HIV-1, resulting in intracellular impairment of viral protein production rather than a direct disruption of viral envelope [41].",

In the case of melittin-treated cells, metabolic activity at the 50% infectious dose (ID50) was higher than 85% of control cultures. Furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that levels of Gag antigen declined in KE37/1 (acutely HIV-1-infected T lymphoma cells) lysates following 9 days treatment with melittin (1.05 and 1.4 \u03bcM) compared to controls [42]. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results also demonstrated that melittin does not suppress expression of porphobilinogen deaminase, a cellular housekeeping gene. Interestingly, melittin suppresses HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) activity in a Tat-independent manner, indicating that melittin interferes with host cell-directed viral gene expression [42]. All the cumulative evidence indicates that dose-dependent anti-HIV effect of melittin is mediated by suppressing HIV transcription and decreasing overall levels of viral gene products rather than the lysis of cellular or viral membranes.",

            "text": "Hood et al. reported the first proof-of-concept investigation concerning inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity by melittin-loaded nanocarriers [43]. In order to quantify HIV-1 infectivity, the authors applied TZM-bl cell line, which is HeLa-derived cells capable of expressing CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. The cell line also harbors luciferase reporter gene under the control of an HIV-1 promoter [77]. After incubation of 50 ng HIV-1 NLHX (CXCR4 tropic) or HIV-1 NLYU2 (CCR5 tropic) strains with soluble CD4 (served as a positive control), nanoparticles, and free melittin at 37 \u00b0C, treated viruses were exploited to infect TZM-bl reporter cells for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. This is followed by lysing the cells and gauging luciferase activity (as a measurement of HIV-1 infectivity). Remarkably, free melittin at concentrations greater than 6 \u03bcM was able to extirpate infectivity of both NLHX and NLYU2 strains. Although 2 \u03bcM of free melittin did not influenced viability of TZM-bl reporter cells, concentrations above 2 \u03bcM rapidly diminished cellular viability, indicating a narrow therapeutic range of melittin. Contrary to free melittin, melittin-loaded nanoparticles had no toxicity toward vaginal keratinocytes in vitro [43]. Besides, 50% inhibitory concentration of melittin-loaded nanoparticles were 2.4 and 3.6 \u03bcM against NLHX and NLYU2 strains, respectively, with no adverse effects on reporter cell viability. Lipid-to-lipid membrane hemi-fusion events may facilitate melittin transportation from nanoparticle lipid monolayers to HIV-1 envelope bilayers, subsequently resulting in melittin aggregation, pore formation, and deactivation of viral packaging [43]. Simplicity of nanoparticle production, lack of melittin nanoparticles toxicity against vaginal keratinocytes, and their potential in reducing HIV-1 infectivity are striking properties of this approach for intra-vaginal prevention of HIV transmission.",

In comparison to virus-infected groups, a pronounced decline in viral titer of VSV-GFP (1598-fold, P < 0.01) was observed following a 30 min of exposure to melittin.

At concentrations equivalent to 25 and 50 \u03bcM, both melittin-loaded liposomes and immunoliposomes were capable of inhibiting VHSV-infected cell foci formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. For instance, inhibition rates of VHSV infectivity were 89.9% and 95.2% in the presence of melittin-loaded liposomes (50 \u03bcM) and immunoliposomes (50 \u03bcM), respectively. Both melittin-loaded liposomes and immunoliposomes interdicted the infectivity of VHSV after virus adsorption to fish cell line epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) at time point 0 and 4 h post-infection [37]. In addition, EPC cell monolayers exhibited > 80% viability after a 24-h exposure to melittin-loaded liposomes (25 \u03bcM) and immunoliposomes (50 \u03bcM) at 14 \u00b0C.

            "text": "The effectiveness of melittin for the treatment of influenza-infected chicken embryos has been exemplified in a report by Mich\u00e1lek et al. [83]. In this regard, influenza A virus subtype H7N7 was inoculated into embryo\u2019s allantois of 9-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs and incubated for 24 h, after which different concentrations of melittin was injected into allantoic fluid. Chicken embryos received only influenza A virus showed survival rates of 40%, implicating high pathogenicity of the virus against embryos. By contrast, influenza-infected embryos which were inoculated with melittin (0.05, 0.5, and 1 \u03bcM) exhibited 80% viability. However, higher concentrations of melittin (2 and 4 \u03bcM) were toxic for influenza-infected embryos, resulting in survival rates of 40%. These experimental data suggest that melittin is well tolerated by chicken embryos for up to 1 \u03bcM [83]. On the whole, melittin holds promise for a new avenue of anti-influenza therapy, from medicine to husbandry.",

In contrast to the placebo group receiving PBS, treatment with melittin led to a constant improvement in cats\u2019 general health status, expressed as Karnofsky\u2019s score. Statistically, a significant difference (P = 0.015) in improvement of conjunctivitis was observed between melittin-treated and placebo-treated cats. Although both groups exhibited amelioration of stomatitis, however, this was not significant. Moreover, no adverse effects including hemolysis and irritation at the injection site in FIV-infected cats were noted [84]. In the case of laboratory parameters (e.g., packed cell volume, hemoglobin, and white blood cells), there were no statistically significant differences between both groups. As for immunologic parameters including CD4+ lymphocytes, CD8+ lymphocytes, and CD4/CD8 ratio, no significant differences between both groups were evident. Similar results were also observed with regard to surrogate parameters (biopterin and 7-xanthopterin in serum and urine) in both groups. Authors stated that lack of significant changes could be attributable to various reasons including inability of melittin to yield strong anti-viral activity in vivo, administration of low dosage of melittin, long treatment intervals, short length of treatment period, and development of antibodies against melittin [84]. Overall, assessment of changes in FIV load together with increasing the total number of cats should be considered for future investigations to provide more trustworthy statistical findings.",

Besides, other plausible anti-viral mechanisms of action such as impediment of viral multiplication [36], decreasing expression levels of viral mRNAs [36, 42], inducing conformational changes in viral genome [44], deactivation of viral packaging [43], attenuation of viral cytopathic effects [36], and inhibition of viral-induced cell fusion [34] have been documented in the literature, as depicted in Fig. 1.",

Multiple approaches can be propounded to diminish cytotoxicity of melittin while augmenting its anti-viral effects, thereby heightening therapeutic indices of the peptide. In this regard, targeted in vivo delivery of AMPs like melittin through a nanocarrier exemplifies a safe solution with desirable pharmacokinetics for both anti-viral and anti-cancer therapies [86, 87]. An alternate novel enticing strategy is conjugation of melittin with aptamers, which are oligonucleotide or peptide molecules capable of binding to their targets with high affinity and specificity [88]. Designing hydrogels embedded with melittin for topical treatment of herpes blisters and papilloma virus-related warts is the other practicable approach which has not been reported hitherto. Last but not least, combination of melittin and current anti-viral drugs may reduce both concerns associated with cytotoxicity of melittin and probability of developing drug-resistant viruses.",
