Of the three genera of influenza viruses (A, B and C), influenza A and influenza B viruses pose a continuous threat to public health. Currently, influenza A viruses of the subtypes H3N2 and H1N1 and influenza B viruses cocirculate with varying predominance in the human population and are responsible for seasonal epidemics that may result in 3\u20135 million cases of severe respiratory illness and up to 500 000 annual deaths worldwide. The natural reservoir of influenza A viruses are wild aquatic birds from where they are transmitted to a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts including humans, pigs and poultry. The emergence of a new influenza A virus for which there is little or no immunity in the human population may provoke an influenza pandemic, with the most devastating pandemic in 1918, the \u2018Spanish flu\u2019, claiming\nc\n. 40 million deaths worldwide. In addition, three more influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th and 21st centuries: the \u2018Asian flu\u2019 in 1957 (H2N2), the \u2018Hong-Kong flu\u2019 in 1968 (H3N2) and, recently, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. In contrast, influenza B viruses are predominantly found in humans and are not known to have an animal reservoir from which new virus variants can emerge.\n",

Influenza is an acute respiratory illness with a rapid onset of symptoms such as fever, headache, generalized malaise and myalgias that may last for 7\u201314 days. Complications may be due to bronchitis, viral pneumonia or myocarditis. Moreover, viral-bacterial pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia due to concomitant or subsequent infection with bacteria, respectively, contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality of influenza infections. Most commonly isolated bacteria are\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n(pneumococcus),\nStaphylococcus aureus\nand\nHaemophilus influenzae\n.

The genome consists of eight segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA, which are associated with the polymerase proteins PB1, PB2 and PA and multiple copies of the nucleoprotein (NP) to form the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) and together encode up to 15 proteins (Jagger\net al.\n,\n2012\n; Muramoto\net al.\n,\n2013\n; Fig.\n1\na). The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer derived from the host cellular plasma membrane and contains the two major spike glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and the proton channel protein M2. The inner side of the envelope is lined by the matrix protein M1. Based on antigenic criteria, influenza A viruses are classified into 17 HA (H1-H17) and 10 NA (N1-N10) subtypes to date (Tong\net al.\n,\n2012\n). Most subtypes circulate in wild aquatic birds and are sporadically transmitted to other species including humans.\n",

Membrane fusion requires proteolytic cleavage of HA and is induced by the acidic pH in the endosome. The vRNPs are imported into the nucleus where transcription and replication of the genome are catalysed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Splicing of viral mRNAs and translation into proteins are performed by the cellular machineries. Influenza virus infection causes a shutoff of host protein synthesis, thereby enhancing translation of viral mRNAs. At the later stages of viral infection, newly synthesized vRNPs and viral proteins are transported to the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells where assembly and budding of new progeny virions take place. Here, NA cleaves N-acetyl-neuraminic acid from carbohydrate moieties, facilitating release of progeny virus from the host cell and preventing virions to clump together.\n",

HA is a type I transmembrane protein and is integrated in the viral envelope as a homotrimer. HA is synthesized as a precursor protein, HA0 (75 kDa), that is transported along the constitutive secretory pathway to the plasma membrane (Fig.\n1\nb). During its transport, HA becomes N-glycosylated, palmitoylated and cleaved into the subunits HA1 (55 kDa) and HA2 (25 kDa) (Fig.\n1\na and b). Cleavage can take place either in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or on the cell surface as discussed below. The amino-terminal cleavage fragment HA1 contains the receptor-binding site and remains linked by a disulphide bond to the carboxy-terminal fragment HA2, which is membrane-anchored and responsible for fusion (Fig.\n2\nb). HA0 is cleaved at a specific arginine residue (R) to expose the fusion peptide consisting of about 14 hydrophobic amino acids at the N-terminus of HA2. Cleavage is a prerequisite for conformational changes at low pH in the endosome that trigger membrane fusion and is essential for the infectivity and spread of influenza viruses. The cleavage site is located in a prominent loop that protrudes from the surface (Fig.\n2\na). The amino acid sequence as well as the structure and susceptibility of the cleavage site are critical for cleavage of HA by different proteases (Klenk & Rott,\n1988\n; Klenk & Garten,\n1994\n; Steinhauer,\n1999\n; Garten & Klenk,\n2008\n).\n",

Interestingly, acquisition of a multibasic cleavage site that is activated by furin seems to be restricted to the subtypes H5 and H7 and has not been observed for any other subtype under natural settings (Klenk & Garten,\n1994\n; Garten & Klenk,\n2008\n). Analysis of the cleavage site of different HPAIV demonstrated that extension of the cleavage site can occur by different mechanisms: polymerase slippage at purine-rich arginine or lysine codons, recombination with viral gene segments (NP or M genes) or 28S ribosomal RNA or still unknown mechanisms and has been reviewed in detail in the study by Garten & Klenk (\n2008\n). Already in early studies, it has been demonstrated that substitution of the multibasic cleavage site of a HPAIV by a monobasic motif results in a low-pathogenic virus. However, insertion of a multibasic cleavage motif into a HA with a monobasic cleavage site does not automatically confer high pathogenicity to the virus, demonstrating that the emergence of a HPAIV is a multifactorial process (Stech\net al.\n,\n2009\n; Schrauwen\net al.\n,\n2011\n). In a recent study, Veits\net al\n. (\n2012\n) introduced a multibasic cleavage site into the HA of several influenza A virus subtypes and generated reassortant viruses in the genetic background of a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Interestingly, reassortants with H2, H4, H8 and H14 with multibasic cleavage site caused lethal infections in chickens, while other subtypes did not. These observations demonstrate that a multibasic HA cleavage site can confer high pathogenicity to subtypes other than H5 and H7 in a suitable genetic background. Therefore, the restriction of natural HPAIV isolates to H5 and H7 subtypes seems to be due to their unique ability to acquire a multibasic cleavage site under natural settings; however, underlying mechanisms are not yet understood.\n",

HAT was originally isolated from patients with chronic airway diseases and among other functions has been demonstrated to cleave fibrinogen, to activate the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) and to increase mucus gene expression and to stimulate bronchial fibroblast proliferation in airway epithelial cells\nin vitro\n(Yoshinaga\net al.\n,\n1998\n; Chokki\net al.\n,\n2004\n; Matsushima\net al.\n,\n2006\n). HAT expression is prominent in the trachea and bronchi and was also detected in the gastrointestinal tract, the skin and the brain (Table\n1\n). In the airway epithelium, HAT has been shown to be expressed in ciliated cells, but not in submucosal glands and mast cells (Takahashi\net al.\n,\n2001\n). TMPRSS2 is widely expressed in epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tract with high expression levels in prostate and colon (Szabo & Bugge,\n2008\n). Moreover, immunohistochemical studies revealed that TMPRSS2 is expressed in cardiac myocytes, suggesting that it might contribute to influenza-associated myocarditis (Bertram\net al.\n,\n2012\n). TMPRSS2 is associated with prostate carcinogenesis in two different ways. The protease has been shown to be overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue. Moreover, fusion of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 promoter to different ETS (E 26) transcription factor genes, resulting in overexpression of the respective transcription factors, is seen in nearly 50% of patients and has established as a prognostic marker of prostate carcinogenesis (Tomlins\net al.\n,\n2009\n). The role of TMPRSS2 in the airways remains to be investigated. Expression studies in\nXenopus\noocytes suggested that TMPRSS2 is involved in regulation of the airway surface liquid (ASL) volume by proteolytic cleavage of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) (Donaldson\net al.\n,\n2002\n).\n",

Incubation of HAT- or TMPRSS2-expressing cells with fluorogenic peptides to measure the protease activity on the cell surface revealed that HAT is present as an enzymatically active enzyme on the cell surface, while TMPRSS2 shows poor if any protease activity (Fig.\n3\nb). The reasons for the lack of TMPRSS2 activity on the cell surface is unknown but might be related to the presence of protease inhibitors, missing cofactors or lower amounts of TMPRSS2 on the cell surface compared with HAT. Immunofluorescence microscopy of transient TMPRSS2- or HAT-expressing cells demonstrates that both HAT and TMPRSS2 are expressed on the cell surface; however, TMPRSS2 accumulates in the Golgi apparatus and TGN and colocalizes with furin, while HAT is expressed predominantly in the plasma membrane (Fig.\n3\nc and d). These data strongly suggest that TMPRSS2 cleaves HA in the TGN. Moreover, these observations demonstrate that cleavage of HA with monobasic and multibasic cleavage site can be performed in the same compartment but by different proteases (cf. Fig.\n1\nb).\n",

Interestingly, HAT on the one hand is capable of cleaving newly synthesized HA0, probably during assembly and budding of new virions on the plasma membrane. Thus, infectious virus containing cleaved HA is released from HAT-expressing cells. Furthermore, HAT can cleave the HA0 of incoming virus at the stage of entry during attachment to the cell, facilitating infection of HAT-expressing cells with virus containing noncleaved HA0 (Figs\n1\nand\n5\n). Activation of HA at two different steps during virus replication seems to be redundant at the first few. But considering that different cell types in the airway epithelium express a partially different protease repertoire, activation of incoming virus by HAT may enable proteolytic activation of progeny viruses released from cells that lack expression of appropriate proteases (Fig.\n5\n). This concept is supported by the observation that the WSN virus is activated upon entry into MDBK cells (Boycott\net al.\n,\n1994\n).\n",

The influenza virus A/chick/Pennsylvania/1/83 (H5N2) possessed the multibasic cleavage site motif K-K-K-R, but the low-pathogenic isolates contained an oligosaccharide at Asn-11 of HA1 that was demonstrated to interfere with cleavage of HA by steric hindrance (Kawaoka\net al.\n,\n1984\n). Interestingly, upon serial passage of a nonpathogenic H5N2 isolate in chicken embryo cells, pathogenic mutants emerged that had retained the carbohydrate side chain, but instead possessed an increased number of basic amino acids at the cleavage site (Ohuchi\net al.\n,\n1989\n). Thus, masking of the cleavage site by an oligosaccharide can be overcome by extension of the cleavage site. The multibasic motif K-K-K-R, however, is not cleaved by furin because of the lysine (K) in P4. In a recent study, the type II transmembrane protease TMPRSS13/MSPL that is widely expressed in several tissues (Table\n1\n) has been shown to cleave the HA at such a motif and to enable systemic infection independent of furin (Okumura\net al.\n,\n2010\n).\n",

            "text": "\nAnother example for an unusual HA cleavage has recently been described for influenza A viruses of the subtype H9N2 that circulate worldwide and have become highly prevalent in poultry in many countries. H9N2 viruses are associated with repeated outbreaks of severe illness in poultry farms in the Middle East and are occasionally transmitted to pigs and humans, raising concern about their pandemic potential. In contrast to most other subtypes, H9N2 viruses vary remarkably in the amino acid sequence at the HA cleavage site. While H9N2 viruses in America, Europe and Africa contain diverse monobasic HA cleavage site motifs, many recent H9N2 isolates from Asia and the Middle East possess di- or tribasic HA cleavage sites of the sequence R-S-S-R or R-S-R-R. Importantly, the di- or tribasic cleavage sites of H9N2 viruses evolved by substitution and not by insertion of basic amino acids as in case of HPAIV of subtypes H5 and H7 (Fig.\n2\nc) and are not cleaved by ubiquitous furin or PC5/6 (Gohrbandt\net al.\n,\n2011\n; Soda\net al.\n,\n2011\n). HAT and TMPRSS2 have been demonstrated to cleave H9 with mono-, di- and tribasic cleavage site motifs (Baron\net al.\n,\n2013\n). Moreover, the TTSP matriptase was shown to cleave H9 with R-S-S-R and R-S-R-R cleavage sites (Baron\net al.\n,\n2013\n). Matriptase is expressed in a wide range of tissues with high expression levels in the kidney (Table\n1\n). Interestingly, nephrotropism has been observed in H9N2 outbreaks in chickens. According to this, H9N2 viruses with R-S-S-R and R-S-R-R cleavage sites were able to undergo multicycle replication in primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells due to proteolytic activation of HA, while H9N2 isolates containing a single R were not. HA activation in CEK cells was inhibited by matriptase inhibitors, suggesting that matriptase may contribute to the nephrotropism of H9N2 viruses in chickens (Baron\net al.\n,\n2013\n). However, it remains to be investigated whether expression of matriptase in a wide range of tissues affects organ tropism and pathogenicity of H9N2 viruses\nin vivo\n.\n",

            "text": "\nIn 1987, Tashiro\net al\n. (\n1987a\n,\nb\n) demonstrated that bacterial infection may also be for the benefit of the virus by producing proteases that facilitate cleavage of HA. Some strains of\nStaphylococcus aureus\n(\nS. aureus)\nwere shown to secrete proteases that are capable of cleaving the HA of certain influenza strains\nin vitro\n(Fig.\n4\na). Interestingly, activation of HA was demonstrated to be specific for both bacteria and virus strains. Thus, for example, a protease secreted by\nS. aureus\nWood 46 was able to cleave the HA of A/swine/1976/31 (H1N1), but not HA of A/chicken/Germany/N/49 (H10N7) (Fig.\n4\na). By contrast, a protease produced by\nS. aureus\nM/86/86 was not capable of activating the HA of A/swine/1976/31 (H1N1), but cleaved the HA of several other influenza A virus isolates. Remarkably, intranasal co-infection of mice with\nS. aureus\nWood 46 and A/swine/1976/31 (H1N1) resulted in fatal disease with extended lesions in the lungs (Fig.\n4\nb and c left diagram), while infection with either the virus or\nS. aureus\nWood 46 alone did not cause significant symptoms of disease and relevant pathological alterations in the lung (Fig.\n4\nb). Low virus titres were found in lungs of mice infected with A/Swine/1976/31 (H1N1) alone, whereas high titres were present in lung homogenates of mice co-infected with\nS. aureus\nWood 46 (Fig.\n4\nc, left diagram). Importantly, the infectivity of virus from lung homogenates of mice infected only with virus was markedly enhanced by trypsin treatment prior to plaque titration, indicating inefficient HA cleavage in the mice. In contrast, the infectivity of progeny virus from mice co-infected with A/swine/1976/31 (H1N1) and\nS. aureus\nWood 46 could not be increased by treatment with trypsin, suggesting that HA was already efficiently cleaved. Thus, co-infection with influenza virus and\nS. aureus\nstrains secreting appropriate HA-cleaving proteases may promote severe pneumonia due to enhanced activation and spread of the virus. Accordingly, co-infection of mice with influenza viruses and\nS. aureus\nstrains producing proteases that failed to cleave the HA of the virus\nin vitro\ndid not lead to significant symptoms of disease in the animals (Fig.\n4\na and c). Low virus titres were present in lungs of mice co-infected with virus and bacteria or infected with virus alone, and infectivity of the progeny virus was increased by trypsin treatment. In agreement with the studies by Tashiro\net al.\n, a protease secreted by\nAerococcus viridans\nwas demonstrated to cleave the HA of several influenza A virus isolates, and co-infection of mice resulted in severe pneumonia with a fatal outcome (Scheiblauer\net al.\n,\n1992\n). However, the HA-activating proteases from\nS. aureus\nand\nA. viridans\nhave not been identified yet, and mechanisms underlying strain-specific differences in HA activation remain unknown. In addition, HA-activating proteases from\nH. influenzae\nor\nS. pneumoniae\nstrains have not been described so far. Attempts to isolate HA-activating proteases from bacteria present in the respiratory tract of pigs or in the lower digestive tract of waterfowl failed (Callan\net al.\n,\n1997\n; King\net al.\n,\n2009\n).\n",

The identification of HAT and TMPRSS2 as HA-activating proteases from human airways, however, provided potential drug targets, and recent progress in the development of protease inhibitors is considerable. Interestingly, mice deficient in TMPRSS2 and HAT activity, respectively, have been shown to lack a discernible phenotype, indicating functional redundancy or compensation of physiological functions by other host proteases (Kim\net al.\n,\n2006\n; Sales\net al.\n,\n2011\n). Knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression using an antisense peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomer (PPMO) strongly suppressed influenza virus replication in human airway epithelial cells without affecting cell viability (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user\net al.\n,\n2011\n). Substrate analogue peptide mimetic inhibitors of HAT containing a 4-amidinobenzylamide moiety as the P1 residue have been demonstrated to efficiently suppress influenza virus replication in HAT-expressing cells (B\u00f6ttcher\net al.\n,\n2009\n; B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user\net al.\n,\n2010\n; Sielaff\net al.\n,\n2011\n). Moreover, a peptide mimetic inhibitor of TMPRSS2 was shown to drastically reduce virus titres and to delay influenza virus propagation by 24\u201348 h in airway epithelial cells\nin vitro\n(B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user\net al.\n,\n2012\n). Remarkably, the combination of the protease inhibitor and the current NA inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate was highly synergistic and efficiently blocked influenza virus propagation in human airway epithelial cells. The further development of abovementioned protease inhibitors may lead to novel drugs that should be considered for influenza treatment \u2013 as monotherapy or in combination with NA inhibitors. It should be mentioned that specific inhibitors of furin have recently been developed and were demonstrated to efficiently suppress virus replication of HPAIV of subtype H7 in cell culture. Inhibition of HA cleavage therefore provides a promising concept for treatment of HPAIV infections in humans, most likely in combination with NA inhibitors, for example oseltamivir (Garten\net al.\n,\n1989\n; Becker\net al.\n,\n2010\n; Y.

The two glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and the ion channel protein M2 are embedded in the envelope. The inner side is lined by the matrix protein M1. The genome consists of eight segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA, which are associated with the nucleoprotein (NP) and the polymerase subunits PB1, PB2 and PA to form viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The nuclear export protein (NEP) is also present in the virion, while the nonstructural proteins NS1, PB1-F2, PB1-N40, PA-X, PA-N155 and PA-N182 are present in the infected cell. (b) Influenza virus replication and proteolytic activation by cellular proteases in human airway epithelial cells. Infection is initiated by the HA through binding to N-acetyl neuraminic acid-containing cell surface receptors. Upon receptor-mediated endocytosis, HA mediates fusion of viral and endosomal membranes at low pH to release the vRNPs into the cytoplasm (uncoating). The vRNPs are imported into the nucleus, where transcription and replication of the viral genome occur. Translation of viral mRNAs is performed by the cellular machinery. HA, NA and M2 are synthesized into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported along the constitutive secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. The internal viral proteins are synthesized at free ribosomes, and protein components of the vRNPs are then imported into the nucleus, where assembly of new vRNPs occurs. Finally, vRNPs are exported from the nucleus and transported to the plasma membrane, where self-assembly of viral proteins leads to budding of new virions. The NA cleaves N-acetyl neuraminic acid from carbohydrate moieties, facilitating release of progeny virions. Proteolytic activation of HA can take place in different compartments and at different time points during viral replication and is indicated by scissors (open scissor: active protease; closed scissor: enzymatically inactive protease; truncated scissor: soluble protease). HA with multibasic cleavage site is cleaved by furin in the TGN. HA containing a monobasic cleavage site is cleaved by TMPRSS2 in the TGN or by HAT on the plasma membrane: either during assembly and budding of progeny virus or during attachment and entry into the cell.",
