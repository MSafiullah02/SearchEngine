            "text": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) heterogeneity influences its atheroprotective effect via reverse cholesterol transport from macrophage to the liver [1]. Cholesterol efflux from a macrophage to the extracellular cholesterol acceptor is the first, and rate-limiting, step of reverse cholesterol transport [2, 3]. Four mechanisms of cholesterol efflux, namely aqueous diffusion, facilitated diffusion mediated by the scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1) receptor, and active unidirectional efflux mediated by the ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) and the ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1) transporters are known [4]. ATP hydrolysis with concomitant conformational transition is required for cholesterol efflux by ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporters. The SR-B1 mediates cholesterol efflux by facilitated diffusion via hydrophobic tunnel within the molecule. Various HDL fractions and lipid-free apolipoprotein A1 (apoA-1) are able to accept cell-derived cholesterol with a different efficiency [2]. Cholesterol transport between intracellular compartments proceeds by both energy-dependent and energy-independent processes [5]. The energy-dependent vesicular traffic partly contributes to cholesterol flux between endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane (PM) and endocytic vesicles. The membrane contact sites and lipid transfer proteins are involved in non-vesicular lipid traffic [6\u201311]. Importantly, the PM cholesterol is the cholesterol that participates in the efflux to the extracellular acceptors [12].",

The predictive significance of CEC for cardiovascular risk is stronger than for HDL cholesterol level [13\u201316]. The second reason is the positive effect of efflux stimulation on the regression of atherosclerotic plaques [15, 17, 18].",

Importantly, the substances are distributed non-uniformly among different pathways; the \u2018biological oxidations\u2019 pathway includes mostly substances with an activating effect on cholesterol efflux (all-trans retinoic acid, ethanol, 17\u03b2-estradiol, progesterone, hydrocortisone, resveratrol), while signaling by the G protein-coupled receptor and protein tyrosine kinase 6 pathways include substances with an inhibiting effect (oleic and eicosapentaenoic acids). \u2018Biological oxidations\u2019 include biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds in the liver, kidneys, gut and lungs. As far as chemicals that undergo functionalization, the electrophilic or nucleophilic species can be detrimental to biological systems. Electrophiles can react with electron-rich macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA by covalent interaction, while nucleophiles have the potential to interact with biological receptors [221]. Thus, in addition to nuclear receptor ligands and their precursors activating cholesterol efflux and lipoprotein metabolism, and widely used in clinics (bezafibrate and fenofibric acid [222], pioglitazone [223], telmisartan [224]), targeting biological oxidation processes looks promising for the correction of inefficient reverse cholesterol transport in humans. For instance, the stimulating effect was described for chloroquine [225], diosgenin [226], 17\u03b2-estradiol [227], all-trans retinoic acid [228], ethanol [229], spermidine [230, 231], resveratrol [232] and 9-cis-retinoic acid [233].",

The substances influencing biological oxidation activate cholesterol efflux, and the substances influencing signaling by GPCR and PTK6 inhibit efflux. This analysis may be useful in the targeted therapy of structural and functional HDL deficiency.",
