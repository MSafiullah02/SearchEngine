Nonetheless, governments are still managing applications for new permanent urban residents' registration, demanded by rural migrant workers, by using the longestablished hukou -based public service policies. This has constituted a big obstacle to the citizenization of rural migrant workers in China, caused a great deal of problems with urban management, and is contrary to social justice. In 2013, it was made clear in the Report on the Work of the Government that relevant authorities should accelerate reform of the household registration system and related institutions; that they should register eligible rural workers as permanent urban residents in an orderly manner, \"progressively expand the coverage of basic public services in urban areas to include all their permanent residents and create an equitable institutional environment for freedom of movement and for people to live and work in contentment.\" 2 Accordingly, in order to protect the rights of migrants and improve the quality of the process of social urbanization in China, the most signifi cant tasks involve investigating the current status of basic public services in Chinese towns and cities, especially the public services provided for potential new permanent migrant worker",

Public services rely on public fi nance support to satisfy public needs, and they include social services, policies benefi tting the public, and social security and public infrastructures. Public services therefore relate closely to government functions and will vary with distinct levels of economic development and the needs of each society. Basic, or core, public services are a function of basic registered city residents' rights to them, established by the basic needs of any society and the capabilities of governments to provide such services. 3 Regarding the public service system, the Chinese government has been paying closer attention to the concept of fairness since 2003. It has invested signifi cantly more money than before in public services for rural areas, such as compulsory education, the NRCMCS and support for the elderly; in urban areas, the provision of basic public services has expanded beyond that given to employees of state-owned organizations to cover those of non-state-owned organizations, urban residents and the low-and middleincome groups. In addition, as the number of rural migrant workers grows, migrant workers have come to represent the majority of industrial workers present in cities, and have made notable contribution to urbanization in China. Consequently, these migrant workers demand access to relevant basic public services, which demand, as urbanization advances in China, is also receiving more attention. In spite of this, the provision of basic public services in urban areas to all residents remains clearly insuffi cient. An examination of basic public services follows:",

Local governments are working to address the issue of education for the children of migrant workers, depending on local conditions. For example, in the province of Guangdong, which is the leading destination for non-local migrants, children of non-local migrant workers already represented 67 % of all students who were receiving compulsory education in 2008. Since the number of non-local migrant workers is still growing, the demand for education services for all children with non-local hukou s is quickly exceeding what public elementary and middle schools can supply. By paying qualifi ed private schools for admitting children with non-local hukou s, the Guangzhou municipal government, for example, is trying to increase the percentage of children with non-local hukou s who receive education in this city; some members of the CPPCC Guangdong Provincial Committee have proposed issuing \"education vouchers\" to let children with non-local hukou s. 4 Since children who migrate with their parents will need to take exams for admission to higher-level schools after the end of compulsory education, the Outline of the National Mid-and Long-term Education Reform and Development Program (2010-2020) proposes that measures for these children to take such exams in host cities be developed. In 2010, the MOE issued the Notice on Organizing Application for Implementing Pilot Projects of the National Education System Reform , which included equal access by children who migrate with their parents to compulsory education and exams for admission to higher-level schools in host cities, as well as the inclusion of further reform of the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) or gaokao , system in the earliest pilot projects of education reform. 5 By the end of 2012, competent local authorities had all worked out schemes for students with non-local hukou s to take the gaokao in host cities (see Table 10 .1 ).",

Main tasks included: health education among migrant workers; creating health records for migrant workers and making timely updates; conducting tuberculosis prevention and control among migrant workers, and making plans for their children's immunization programs; conducting programs to protect migrant workers from exposure to the AIDS virus and to carry out occupational disease prevention and control.

In addition to basic pension insurance for urban workers, the basic medical and pension insurance systems for all urban residents have been established after the Social Insurance Law was implemented. These social security systems exhibit the drive towards socialization, compliance, wide coverage and multiple dimensions of basic urban social security provision in China. 9 In addition, a social security system for nonlocal migrant workers is being put in place. Nationwide, in addition to work insurance, the percentages of employers that bought insurance for their employees, or migrant workers who bought insurance for themselves, was increasing more rapidly Table 10 .2 ). In 2012, the numbers of migrant workers covered by urban basic medical and work-injury insurance increased by 3.55 and 3.45 million people respectively, compared to 2011. 10 Regional social security systems have also been established in east, central and west China. The percentages of migrant workers covered by both work-injury and medical insurance, in particular, are higher than those of migrant workers covered by other insurances, due to the nature of their jobs. Also, from a sectoral perspective, the percentages of non-local migrant workers covered by relevant insurance in such sectors as manufacturing, wholesale/retail, transport/warehousing/postal service and residential services are higher than in others such as the building industry (see Table 10 .3 ).

The Chinese government launched two rounds of proactive employment policies, with one round being centered on the Notice on Further Improving Work Relevant to the Reemployment of the Laid-off and Unemployed People issued at the national work meeting on reemployment in September 2002, and the other on GF [2005] No. 36 Document, promoting the continuous development of local public employment services. Registered unemployed urban residents and people laid off from SOEs could from then on all receive free job advisory services. Employment support policies for university graduates as well as disadvantaged urban families and groups (e.g. families in which nobody has a job and people who have diffi culties in getting a job) have also been improved. 11 , 12 As the number of rural migrant workers keeps growing, host cities, who used to focus only on employment rights' protection, have expanded the employment services to include allowing these migrants to enjoy equal access to the whole range of public employment services. In January 2003, the State Council issued the Notice on Providing Employment Management and Services for Migrant Workers in Cities , proposing to do away with unreasonable restrictions on farmers' migration into cities for work, to address late payment and underpayment of wages, and to provide appropriate training and management of these issues. Later in 2003, six ministries/ commissions such as the MOA jointly issued the Training Program for Migrant Workers across China, 2003 -2010 , which included provision for migrant worker training and tools for performance evaluation of government at all levels, with a view to improving the employment stability of migrant workers. 13 The central government reemphasized in its No. 1 document of 2004 that relevant authorities should remove administrative restrictions and unreasonable charges for farmers' migration into cities for work and should seek to protect their economic rights. It also required municipal governments to expand the provision of public services to migrant workers. The Notice of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Finance on Issues Regarding Further Improving the Public Employment Service System issued in 2013 makes clear that the basic principle of public employment services is to provide basic public employment services in a sustainable and equitable manner across China by merging urban and rural labor markets and creating a long-term service mechanism that is geared to both urban and rural areas and that serves, in effect, all workers. 11 Wen Junping: \"On equal access to public employment services and the approach to realizing it\", the Journal of Shanghai Business School 2010 Issue 6. 12 Li Gongda: \"On the public employment service system in China\", Labor Security 2008 Issue 10. 13 On the question of legal support, the Labor Contract Law which became effective on January 1, 2008, together with the Employment Promotion Law and the Labor Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Law which were both issued in 2007, all stipulate basic legal support for all job seekers, including migrant workers, in terms of fair employment and rights' protection.",
