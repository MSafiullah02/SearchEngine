They recommended performing reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) for SAR\u2010CoV\u20102 from deep nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal mucosa in the appropriate clinical settings. If pregnant patients are asymptomatic, they are recommended to quarantine themselves at home until the results of RT\u2010PCR are available. On the basis of the results, if the test is negative, there is no need for further isolation, but if the test results are positive, they can still be isolated at home for 14 days with close monitoring of mother and regular fetal surveillance by ultrasound and doppler studies. In the case of symptomatic COVID\u201019 patients, monitoring at the hospital with isolation under negative pressure is recommended. Maternal and fetal surveillance should continue while the patient is in hospital and waiting for further test results. Further management involves appropriate decision\u2010making based on the trimester of the patient, fetal well\u2010being, and maternal symptoms. It is important to note that computed tomography of the chest is an essential modality to evaluate pulmonary symptoms of COVID\u201019 patients, and preliminary guidelines recommend the same due to the minimal risk of radiation exposure to the fetus. Also, there is no guideline regarding antiviral therapy because we still do not have any specific antiviral drugs for COVID\u201019 pneumonia. Liang et al\n5\n recommended that lopinavir/ritonavir combination could be considered as it is safe to use in pregnancy. Similarly, corticosteroids are not generally recommended in COVID\u201019 pneumonia (except ARDS), but if required in a case of preterm labor, intramuscular betamethasone injections can be given for fetal lung maturity.",

They did not check vaginal linings for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viral shedding; hence, transmission during delivery was not confirmed. A much bigger case series by Liu et al's study showed that 11 out of 13 pregnant patients had complications requiring emergency C\u2010section in five patients, whereas the other six patients had preterm labor.\n7\n\n",

Besides Wong et al's study on pregnant patients affected with SARS (2009), as mentioned by Jiao et al, there are few more studies that we would like to discuss to complement the topic with more concrete data.\n10\n, \n11\n Lam et al performed a comparative study on patients infected with SARS (2009)\u201410 pregnant vs 40 nonpregnant patients. The study confirmed that pregnant patients (three deaths) had poorer outcomes as compared (P = .006) with nonpregnant ones (no deaths). Pregnant patients developed more complications, like a renal failure (P = .006) and DIC (P = .006), as compared with nonpregnant patients.\n10\n Similar comparative studies are lacking as of now for COVID\u201019 confirmed pregnant patients; hence, it is difficult to comment definitively on the basis of available data, but we expect to have more data on COVID\u201019 pregnant patients in near future to study such outcomes. Table 1 mentions the three major studies from three major outbreaks\u2014COVID\u201019,\n7\n MERS,\n11\n and SARS\n12\n\u2014for better understanding. On the basis of these studies, we can conclude that the mortality rate in SARS\u2010infected pregnant patients, as reported by Lam et al (reported mortality rate 30%) and Wong et al (reported mortality rate 25%), was almost two to three times more than in SARS\u2010infected nonpregnant population (reported mortality rate 9%\u201010%).\n7\n, \n11\n, \n12\n\n",

To attest the same, we hereby mention a report on two Chinese physicians who had COVID\u201019 exposure during their pregnancy and had to undergo C\u2010section.\n13\n Fortunately, baby and the mother in both cases did not suffer from any peripartum complication.
