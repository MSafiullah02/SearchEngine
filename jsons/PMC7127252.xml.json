COVID-19 rapidly spreads in China and to other parts of the world. Currently more than 70,000 laboratory-confirmed cases in China have been reported, and the case count has been rising daily. Some travelers-related transmission were also identified in many countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Germany, France, United States (U.S.), Australia, etc. through an international conveyance, and raised a global health emergency.1 As of February 18, 2020, there were 22 confirmed cases in Taiwan. Herein we presented the first case identified in Taiwan on January 21, 2020.",

Owing to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and the announcement of related symptoms, she was immediately placed in quarantine ward and underwent examination. Although the patient denied spending time at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and reported no known contact with ill people during her stay in Wuhan, specimens including oropharyngeal swab and sputum were collected for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) in accordance with the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) guidance.",

Before seeking medical treatment in Taiwan, she bought over-the-counter medicine to release the symptoms. After admission to our hospital, her vital signs remained stable, apart from the exertional dyspnea, intermittent dry cough and sore throat (Fig. 1\n). The initial physical examination revealed a BT of 36.4 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 93/53 mm Hg, pulse of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breath/min, and SPO2 of 91% while the patient was breathing supplement oxygen by nasal cannula at 3 L/min. The breathing sound was normal initially. The laboratory results reflected lymphopenia (531 cells/ul), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 78 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 41 U/L), C-reactive protein (CRP, 7.8 mg/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 295 U/L) (Fig. 1). A rapid screening test for influenza A and B showed negative. The chest X-ray revealed bilateral perihilar infiltration and ill-defined patchy opacities. On January 21, 2020, the TCDC confirmed that the patient's oropharyngeal swab and sputum tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR assay.",

Antitussive agent, O2 supplement, careful saline infusion and empiric antibiotic with ceftriaxone (2 gm loading and 2 gm everyday intravenously) were administered at first. Subsequently, antibiotics were replaced by oral amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg every 12 h on illness day 17 for another 1 week.

In accordance with the first report from China, the major symptoms of COVID-19 infection were mainly cough, fever and dyspnea.2 Our case presented with mild fever, dyspnea and mild hypoxemia on day 10 of initial illness. At the same time, the chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrating pneumonia, which progressed diffusely later. The progression of symptoms in this case also coincided with the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the U.S., with fever on day 5 of illness, dyspnea with mild hypoxemia and radiographical pneumonia on day 9 of illness.3 Furthermore, reports from China showed all patients had bilateral pneumonia on high resolution CT with different severity even in mild cases.2\n,\n4 These findings suggested that lower respiratory tract seems to be an important location for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Our case turned afebrile since admission (illness day 10), even without antiviral treatment. Despite pneumonia on chest X-rays worsen in the following seven days, respiratory failure did not occur eventually. Even though ceftriaxone was used, the evidence of negative culture and the worsening chest X-ray findings under antibiotic treatment were not compatible with the clinical picture of bacterial pneumonia. The effective medical treatment against COVID-19 remains unknown. In spite of the first-reported case in the U.S. showing promptly-subsided fever after Remdesivir used on day 12 of illness, with well-improved clinical symptoms later, the effectiveness of Remdesivir was still questioned.3 The randomized-controlled trial of treating Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus by the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir/interferon-beta-1b is ongoing, more evidence-based data are needed.5\n",
