Admission to hospitals for diabetic patients who need care is proven difficult. Admissions to hospitals are restricted to a specific number of hospitals. Moreover, the hospital requires documentation from the patient to prove a negative COVID-test before allowing admission. This adds to the cost of care, which might further complicate receiving care for diabetic patients. 4 . Routine diabetic care is significantly impaired during the current epidemic. Many outpatient clinics and training units have been closed. Many private clinics of endocrinologists are also temporarily shut down. This leaves the private sector to provide emergency services to non-COVID patients, only. Many patients can't use such private services due to a lack of insurance or facility to pay for services. 5. Due to the fear of illness, patients do not visit a few opened laboratories to monitor their blood sugar status, and many do not have a glucometer for self -monitoring. 6 . The basis of education and treatment of diabetes in low-income countries is limited to a faceto-face visit of the endocrinologist or primary care provider. There are no telemedicine practices, so in this epidemic, preventive measures which traditionally were communicated with patients have been disrupted.",

Few strategies for better management of diabetes in the COVID-19 crisis were suggested for low-income countries. The available guidelines are mostly adopted for developed countries and do not foresee critical problems faced by diabetic patients in undeveloped countries. The most essential suggestions of such guidelines were using telehealth, remote patient monitoring, wearable technologies, implementation of online services for glucose management, popularization of Internet and smartphones, utilization of free educational videos, e-books on diabetes self-management, and COVID-19 prevention advice for the public via WeChat mobile app. To improve such wireless communications emerging fifth-generation networks were also suggested [6] [7] [8] .
