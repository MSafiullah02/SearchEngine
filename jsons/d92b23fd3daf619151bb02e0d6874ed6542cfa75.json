            "text": "COVID-19 and low levels of vitamin D appear to disproportionately affect black and minority ethnic individuals. We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether it explained the higher incidence of COVID-19 in black and South Asian people. States a pattern of higher risk has been observed in African Americans. 3 Consequently, the relationship between ethnicity and COVID-19 has been identified as an urgent public health research priority. 4 Several factors have been proposed to explain the apparent greater risk of COVID-19 infection in ethnic minority groups. UK Government statistics show that people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds are more likely than white British people to live in the most socioeconomically deprived areas of England. 5 Furthermore, certain minority ethnic groups experience a higher burden of comorbid disease, 6 which may put them at higher risk of more severe COVID-19 infection. 7, 8 One potential mediator could be the higher prevalence of apparent vitamin D deficiency in black and minority ethnic populations. 4 Vitamin D is variably inversely associated with multiple health outcomes and mortality (although these associations may not be causal). 9 Most vitamin D results from production in the skin following exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Individuals with dark skin have, on average, lower concentrations of blood vitamin D because the melanin in dark skin does not absorb as much UV. 10 Furthermore, deficiency is more common in high latitude countries such as the UK. Whilst most chronic conditions have not been improved by vitamin D supplementation, a recent meta-analysis of randomised trials suggested vitamin D may lessen the risk of acute respiratory infections. 11 In this study, we hypothesised that blood 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 risk among UK Biobank participants, and explained wholly, or in part, the higher incidence of COVID-19 infection in ethnic minority participants.",

This is unlikely to contribute to the risk we observed in UK Biobank because all participants spoke English (albeit with the possibility of fluency variation). The association with ethnicity was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for socioeconomic and lifestyle differences in white and black and minority ethnic participants; the risk of COVID-19 remained around 4-fold in black participants and more than 2-fold in South Asians. Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms underlying ethnic variations in risk of COVID-19 infection and its severity. It may be that pathways related to cardiometabolic conditions or differences in cardiorespiratory reserve, or potentially other social factors, are more relevant, as we have recently discussed. 23 Our study replicated findings showing increased risk of COVID-19 in black and minority ethnic individuals, in men, and in people who are overweight or obese. It is surprising that we did not observe an association between diabetes or blood pressure and COVID-19 risk. Other studies have shown increased risk of hospitalisation and severe illness requiring ventilation in patients with diabetes and hypertension. 7, 24 However, ours is a relatively healthy general population cohort.

COVID-19; vitamin D; ethnicity Introduction A novel coronavirus that manifested in 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a pandemic of pneumonia-related illness (COVID-19) with an estimated case fatality of around 1%. There is an urgent need to better understand risk factors for contracting the infection and for poorer prognosis thereafter. There is growing evidence that COVID-19 disproportionately affects black and minority ethnic individuals, with the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre reporting that a third of confirmed cases admitted to critical care in England are non-white 1 . This compares with the 2011 Census figures which show that 14% of the general population of England and Wales identify themselves as black and minority ethnic individuals. 2 Similarly, in the United",
