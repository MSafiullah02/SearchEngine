            "text": "The economic and social shock presented by the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to reshape perceptions of individuals and organizations about work and occupations and result in both micro and macro shifts in the world of work. In this essay we focus on three occupationallyrelated domains that may be impacted by the pandemic. First, perceptions of the value and status of different occupations may change, resulting in both changes of occupational supply and demand (macro changes) and changes in the perceived calling and meaningfulness of different occupations (micro changes). Second, the great -work from home experiment\u2016 may change occupational perspectives on working from home. Organizations and researchers may be able to better understand which occupational and individual characteristics are associated with workfrom-home effectiveness and better designate occupational groups and individuals to working (or not working) from home. Third, we discuss the increased segmentation of the labor market which allocate workers to -good jobs\u2016 and -bad jobs\u2016 and the contribution of occupational segmentation to inequality.",

Previous economic shocks tended to cover a narrow group of workers, occupations, or industries. For example, the 2000 dot.com bubble burst had a significant negative impact on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) occupations but a minor negative impact on occupations in other sectors of the economy. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, is widespread and may result in not only the temporal disappearance of some occupations and a dramatic growth in other occupations, but also in changes in the status of some occupations and their value proposition. In this essay we focus on the implications of the pandemic for (a) the values embedded in occupations and the status associated with occupations and the association this might have with new occupational perceptions of meaningful work and calling; (b) the manner in which organizations perceive work from home arrangements within a given occupational group and between different occupations; and, (c) change in occupational segmentation and its relationship to gender, racial, and ethnic inequality.",

            "text": "Occupations have different statuses associated with them. An occupational status, a key measure of socioeconomic status, is traditionally defined as the power privilege, and prestige that are associated with a specific occupation (Lin, Ensel, & Vaughn, 1981) . A broader definition of occupational status also includes the level institutional social recognition an occupation receives (Zhou, 2007) . As such, occupational status can be affected by societal changes and more specifically, by changes in what is being perceived by society and individuals as -more important work\u2016 versus -less important work\u2016. Occupational status is important because occupations with higher status tend to attract more employees, even when the monetary rewards Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 they offer are not high (e.g., teachers, Ashiedu & Scott-Ladd, 2012) . While in many cases occupations with higher status are those that require higher education, institutional social recognition entails that the status of an occupation is also associated with serving desired societal values (Zhou, 2007) . For example, Nam and Boyd's (2004) occupational status scale gives an identical occupational status score to police officers and archivists even though the educational demands for archivists are considerably higher (a bachelor's degree). In turn, an archivist's median salary in 2018 was $48,400 while a police officer median salary was $63,380 (BLS, 2020a, b) . While many other factors might affect the status of an occupation and the median compensation, for example, occupational gender composition (e.g., Macpherson & Hirsch, 1995) and supply and demand of workers (e.g., Katz & Murphy, 1992) , this example clearly demonstrates the association between the social recognition an occupation receives and the status of the occupation.

Given a specific occupational group, what determines the distribution of productivity within an occupational group? Answers to these questions can have a profound impact in identifying which different occupational groups will structure their work arrangements. For some occupations, it may be that the nature of the work itself determines the level of productivity workers are able to achieve from home. In essence, individual preferences, personality, and behaviors will have little impact on their level of productivity when working from homeoccupational characteristics will trump individual characteristics and preferences.

            "text": "Will the Covid-19 pandemic result in an increased occupational status of some occupations and negatively affect the occupational status of other occupations? This is a complex question because macro and micro forces may be in play when changes in the status of occupations occur. For example, positive changes in the long term demand for some occupations (e.g., health care) are likely to increase their status and the rewards they offer. At the same time, the institutional social recognition and individuals' perception of these occupations may also be more positive, changing the status of these occupations, resulting in greater attraction (supply) of individuals to these occupations. This question is important not just because occupational status affects attraction into some occupations and the pay different occupations offer, but also because occupational status is related to the meaningful work and calling individuals perceive different occupations to have. Specifically, changes in the status of different occupations can alter perceptions regarding the three dimensions meaningful work: positive meaning of work, meaning making through work, and the greater good motivations associated with work(Steger, Dik, & Duffy, 2012). These notions open up possibilities for future scholarly work. For example, how are individual perceptions of meaningful work and calling in certain occupations influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic? Will organizations change the monetary rewards, benefits, and symbolic recognition they offer to some occupational groups? Will the labor market experience a shift in the supply of labor in some occupations?",
