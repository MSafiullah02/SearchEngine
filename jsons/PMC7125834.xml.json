In a previous paper we reported the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) in sera from various mouse strains after MHV infection [3]. The autoAb were directed to a 40-kDa protein present in mouse liver and kidney, later identified as fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), a soluble cytosolic enzyme that mediates the hydrolytic formation of fumarate and acetoacetate [3].",

ELISA and Western blot competition assays indicated that the autoAb could recognize either cryptic or native FAH epitopes, the response being different between individuals [4]. Furthermore, to analyze the Ab repertoire to sequential FAH epitopes in MHV-infected mice, a set of 24 decapeptides displaying at least 20% of identity between the sequence of mouse FAH and viral proteins E2, nucleocapside, E1 and RNA polymerase was used.

Overlapping decapeptides corresponding to the entire mouse FAH sequence were prepared using the PEPSCAN method and their reactivities with sera from MHV-infected mice at different times was determined by ELISA. Results indicated that various regions of the enzyme, including sequence 1\u201320, are recognized as soon as 15 days after infection and that the autoimmune response is not restricted to peptides homologous to viral proteins. Besides, the determinant spreading phenomenon was discarded because individual mouse sera did not display the corresponding pattern of response.",

Strikingly, whereas the N-terminal portion of FAH shares a high degree of homology with various MHV proteins, sequence 390\u2013420 does not display any similarity with viral proteins. Furthermore, the autoAb reacted with homologous peptides surrounding residues 70, 160 and 360, but non-homologous sequences around residues 130, 210, 240, 250 and 300 were also recognized. Thus, autoAb were not restricted to similar sequences, suggesting that structural patterns other than linear epitopes were involved in the autoimmune response. Accordingly, it has been proposed that viral regions that are able to initiate autoimmune responses do not need to have sequences analogous to the autoantigen [14] and, since the only requirement should be structural similarity, some authors propose that \u201cmolecular mimicry\u201d should be changed to \u201cstructural mimicry\u201d [15].",

Thus, it was suggested that structural features of autoantigens, their locations, and catabolism during cell death and their translocation to cells that can present antigens to the immune system could contribute to selection of the autoimmune repertoire [16], [17]. MHV is known to be lymphotropic and to induce diverse alterations of immune responses that depend on the mouse genetic background [1], [2], [3], [4], [18], [19], but why liver FAH was chosen as autoantigen among the large variety of liver proteins? As said by P. H Plotz [17]: \u201cThe repertoire of target autoantigens is a wunderkammer \u2013 a collection of curiosities \u2013 of molecules with no obvious linking principle\u201d. In the present model of MHV-induced anti-FAH autoAb, it seems that antigen mimicry \u2013 FAH N-terminal sequence is about 50% homologous with a MHV protein \u2013 together with the alarm signals released by the MHV-injured tissues leads to the autoimmune response.",
