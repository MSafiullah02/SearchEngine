The first cases were reported in December, 2019.\nAdded value of this study\nWe have described the genomic characteristics of 2019-nCoV and similarities and differences to other coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002\u201303. Genome sequences of 2019-nCoV sampled from nine patients who were among the early cases of this severe infection are almost genetically identical, which suggests very recent emergence of this virus in humans and that the outbreak was detected relatively rapidly. 2019-nCoV is most closely related to other betacoronaviruses of bat origin, indicating that these animals are the likely reservoir hosts for this emerging viral pathogen.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nBy documenting the presence of 2019-nCoV in a sample of patients, our study extends previous evidence that this virus has led to the novel pneumonia that has caused severe disease in Wuhan and other geographical localities. Currently available data suggest that 2019-nCoV infected the human population from a bat reservoir, although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans.\n",

A novel, human-infecting coronavirus,10, 11 provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was identified with use of next-generation sequencing. As of Jan 28, 2020, China has reported more than 5900 confirmed and more than 9000 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection across 33 Chinese provinces or municipalities, with 106 fatalities. In addition, 2019-nCoV has now been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and the USA. Infections in medical workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.12 Most of the infected patients had a high fever and some had dyspnoea, with chest radiographs revealing invasive lesions in both lungs.12, 13\n",

Some contigs identified in all the samples were closely related to the bat SARS-like betacoronavirus bat-SL-CoVZC45 betacoronavirus.23 Bat-SL-CoVZC45 was then used as the reference genome and reads from each pool were mapped to it, generating consensus sequences corresponding to all the pools. These consensus sequences were then used as new reference genomes. Eight complete genomes and two partial genomes (from samples WH19002 and WH02; table) were obtained. The de novo assembly of the clean reads from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs that corresponded to other viruses at high abundance.",

Through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses (appendix p 4), we found that, although 2019-nCoV was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 at the whole-genome level, the receptor-binding domain of 2019-nCoV fell within lineage B and was closer to that of SARS-CoV (figure 5A). The three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain was modelled using the Swiss-Model program33 with the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8)34 as a template. This analysis suggested that, like other betacoronaviruses, the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain (figure 5B\u2013D). Notably, the external subdomain of the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of SARS-CoV. This result suggests that 2019-nCoV might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor. However, we also observed that several key residues responsible for the binding of the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain to the ACE2 receptor were variable in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain (including Asn439, Asn501, Gln493, Gly485 and Phe486; 2019-nCoV numbering).",

This finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source. Evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission.12 Clearly, this infection is a major public health concern, particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush, during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through China.",

Moreover, bat-derived coronaviruses fell in basal positions in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, with 2019-nCoV most closely related to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were also sampled from bats.23 These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-nCoV in particular. However, despite the importance of bats, several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans. First, the outbreak was first reported in late December, 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%, which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV. Fourth, in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats acted as the natural reservoir, with another animal (masked palm civet for SARS-CoV35 and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV)36 acting as an intermediate host, with humans as terminal hosts. Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market.",

Therefore, we suggest that 2019-nCoV might use ACE2 as the receptor, despite the presence of amino acid mutations in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain.
