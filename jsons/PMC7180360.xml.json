            "text": "The advent of the intrauterine device (IUD) heralded a new era of convenience and effectiveness in contraception. IUDs currently available in the United States are small, T-shaped plastic devices imbued with varying concentrations of progestins or copper, which are inserted into the uterine cavity by a healthcare provider and left in place for 3\u201310 years, depending on the device. In addition to the convenience and discretion of a contraceptive which is administered only once every several years, IUDs also confer significant health benefits. Hormonal IUDs are routinely used to treat excessive menstruation and pelvic pain associated with endometriosis and adenomyosis. There are also data to suggest these devices may play a role in the clearance of HPV infection as well as the prevention of gynecologic cancers [1,2].",

According to data from the 2015\u20132017 National Survey of Family Growth, 64.5% of the 72.2 million U.S. women aged 15\u201349 reported using some form of contraception within the last year. Of those, 10.3% reported using a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) such as an IUD or hormonal implant [3,4]. An analysis of survey data from 2008 to 2014 noted a rise in IUD use from 6% to 14% accompanied by the concurrent drop in permanent sterilization in the same group from 37% to 28%, perhaps suggesting a changing preference toward reversible, less invasive contraception [5].",

As with virtually any contraceptive method, unplanned pregnancy is a known complication in less than 1% of patients using the copper IUD. Uterine perforation has also been reported in 0.2% of patients in clinical trials of the copper IUD [6]. Device migration, movement of the device outside the uterine cavity, is an uncommon phenomenon which has been reported almost exclusively in case reports. A review of the literature from the last 20 years yielded reports of copper IUD migration to the fallopian tube, omentum, appendix, ileum, sigmoid colon, and bladder. While IUD migration is often discovered incidentally in asymptomatic patients, many patients who are later found to have a migrated IUD initially present with abdominal pain or fistulas which are thought to result from inflammation and adhesions formed in response to copper [[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]].",

Corrosion of copper wire is an expected and necessary event as it allows for copper ions to seep out of the device and exert their contraceptive effects. Electron micrograph studies of used devices demonstrate duration-dependent corrosion detectable after as little as 6 months of use, with the greatest degree of corrosion on the vertical arm of the device. While the exact mechanism is unknown, researchers suggest endometrial secretions near the cervix create a more corrosive environment leading to disproportionate damage to the copper coil on the long arm of the device [20]. Another purported mechanism of degradation is via the presence of Actinomyces species, which have been shown to colonize IUDs [21].",

Furthermore, while the patients underwent extensive examination and imaging, the removed devices themselves were not cultured or examined under microscopy. Bacterial colonization with species such as Actinomyces may have sped copper degradation.",

            "text": "These cases underline the importance of carefully examining IUDs following their removal. Specifically, providers should ascertain the exact type of device they plan to remove and be aware of all device components, such as copper coils and hormone release capsules. In a 1987 report on intrauterine devices, the World Health Organization recommended the prompt removal of migrated IUDs even when discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic patient [22]. This recommendation is especially poignant for patients using copper IUDs given the established propensity of copper to induce inflammation and adhesion formation within the peritoneum. While the IUDs we encountered in the above cases were found in utero, we feel this work allows for the extension of the WHO recommendation to include removal of any retained copper following the removal of a copper IUD. Providers should strive for prompt minimally invasive copper fragment removal as patients in whom intervention is delayed ultimately require more invasive procedures. While we present evidence for the previously theoretical complication of retained copper fragments following the removal of a copper IUD, we stress the rarity of such complications and the continued safety of IUDs. It is our hope that this report will also inform the counseling of future patients regarding the risks of copper IUD use. Given that copper IUDs are composed of a polyethylene backbone and three copper coils, patients should be notified of the risk of these additional components separating from the device when compared to the hormonal or plain IUD. Furthermore, patients should be advised they may require surgery to remove any retained copper fragments in order to mitigate dangerous sequelae such as adhesion formation.",
