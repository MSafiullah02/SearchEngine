The PCR products were sequence verified using automated cycle sequencing with dyedeoxy nucleotide terminators (373A DNA sequencer; Applied Biosystems Inc. CA, USA). Primer sequences were as follows: Sense for CD13 5\u2032-XCGAGATCTCGAGTCCAGGGTCCAGGTTCCAG; X denotes biotin and underlined nucleotides a BglII restriction site (primer # 1 in Fig. 1\nA). Anti-sense for CD13 5\u2032-CGCAAGCTTGCGTGACAGTGCGATGATTGTGCAC, where underlined nucleotides denote a HindIII restriction site (primer # 4 in Fig. 1A). For GAPDH sense 5\u2032-XCGGAATTCCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCG, where X denotes biotin and underlined nucleotides an EcoRI restric tion site. Anti-sense GAPDH 5\u2032- CGCGGATCCCGAGGGATCTCGCTCCTGGAAG, where underlined nucleotides denotes a BamHI restriction site. All oligonucleotides were purchased from DNA Technology, Aarhus, Denmark. CD13 primers were designed to span a MluNI restriction site whereas GAPDH harboured an internal NcoI restriction site. Digestion with this internal restriction enzyme divided the PCR products into two (Fig. 1A). Dynabead (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) purification of the two fragments was followed by a PCR mediated modification of the two fragments: Linker sequences originating from cDNA of a plant transcription factor (Pallisgaard, unpublished manuscript) were added to the 5\u2032end and 3\u2032ends of the two fragments, respectively. Primers were as follows: Sense CD13 5\u2032-CACCGTCCTGCAGATCGGCAAGGCACAAAAGAGGTTGCAATTGCAAAACCAAGGGCTTCTATATTTCC (primer # 3 in Fig. 1A), anti-sense CD13 5\u2032-CCGATCTGCAGGACGGTGTTGTCTAGATTTTCATCATCCATATGTGAACCATGGTGATGGTGGGG (primer # 2 in Fig. 1A). Sense GAPDH 5\u2032-CACCGTCCCAGATCGGCCAGGCACAAAAGAGGTTGCAACATGGCACCGTCAAGGCTG, anti-sense for GAPDH 5\u2032-CCGATCTGCAGGACGGTGTTGTCTAGATTTTCATCATCCGAATTTGCCATGGGTGGAATC. Underlined nucleotides denote overlapping sequences. The linker sequences were complementary for 18 nucleotides and could hence be ligated together afterwards in a PCR as shown in Fig. 1A. Thus, non-human sequences were introduced into the middle of the target areas of CD13 and GAPDH. While attached to dynabeads modified CD13 products were digested with HindIII whereas GAPDH products were treated with BamHI. The cut off nucleotides were removed by washing the dynabeads. Digestion of CD13 products with BglII and GAPDH with EcoRI ensured that all PCR fragments found in solution were ready for ligation into an already EcoRI-BamHI or HindIII-BglII digested cloning and in vitro transcription plasmid pSP72 (Promega, WI, USA). The constructed plasmids were amplified by electrotransformation of the E. coli strain K803. Due to an ampicillin gene in pSP72, selection of ampicillin resistant colonies was possible. The cloned plasmids were sequenced to ensure the right sequences for HIS.",

Densiometric analysis identified dilution steps of competitive PCR where ratios between target and HIS shifted. For each patient competitive PCR was performed again in replica using cDNA corresponding to the three or four dilution steps surrounding the equivalence point in order to ensure reproducibility in the quantification. By calculating the ratio between HIS and target, regression analysis was made and initial amount of CD13 target within the samples were found and related to GAPDH level within the same sample.",

Post transcriptional events affecting CD13 mRNA conditions have also been observed in rat frontal cortex [40], just as promoter mediated regulation of CD13 surface expression has been shown to be dependent of promoter activity in endometrial cells [41].
