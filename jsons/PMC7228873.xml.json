Similarly, other cardiology societies5\n,\n6 are recommending deferring or canceling non-emergent procedures and imaging studies, leading to a drastic decrease in the procedure and patient volume. On the other hand, there are reports of the decline in the number of patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes in regions severely affected by the pandemic.7 To make the situation grim, current projections predict that this trend is expected to continue for several months.",

For fellows training in interventional cardiology and cardiac electrophysiology as a procedural specialty, minimal procedural volumes are required of fellows to ensure the development of appropriate technical skills.8 With the ongoing pandemic, which has curbed the entire US, it is clear that, at least during the remainder of the 2019\u20132020 academic year, most fellows will not be able to accomplish clinical rotations, procedure volumes and patient care encounter as outlined in the ACGME program requirements for graduate medical education in cardiovascular disease. The impact of these deficient experiences will be greatest on fellows in their final years of training and, especially, this being the final quarter of the academic year, the fellows are expected to make independent decisions and consolidate the cognitive skills, which they have acquired over the past year. The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the ACGME have already recognized that trainees might not be able to achieve the minimal specialty-specific case requirement in the current year.9\n",

However, due to a nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), inadequate testing, limited treatment options, and extended workloads, trainees are deeply concerned that they may contract the illness and expose their family members at home, who may be more vulnerable to the virus. This has led some physicians to distance themselves from their family and remain in a separate room or home and only see their family through the window or by video calling. As the front line providers, fellows are also succumbing to illness, with many being quarantined due to exposure to the virus or recovering from COVID-19 infections themselves.",

With a loss in savings, many hospitals and practices are curtailing new hires, withdrawing offers and reducing the reimbursement to the physicians who will be unable to meet the productivity target for this fiscal year.
