PCBP is a host protein that regulates the stability and expression of several cellular mRNAs (reviewed by Ostareck-Lederer et al., 1998). The molecular mechanism by which PCBP interacts with the translation apparatus remains poorly understood, but it has been shown to interact with other RNA binding proteins, including poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1) (Wang et al., 1999). Evidence suggests that the poliovirus 5\u2032 cloverleaf ternary complex has a bifunctional role, participating in both viral translation and RNA replication Simoes and Sarnow 1991, Gamarnik and Andino 1998. The binding of the cellular protein PCBP to the cloverleaf RNA enhances viral translation. In contrast, the binding of the viral polymerase precursor, 3CD, to the cloverleaf represses viral translation and promotes the synthesis of negative stranded RNA Gamarnik and Andino 1998, Barton et al. 1999.",

            "text": "An open question concerning the replication of RNA viruses is how the same viral replication machinery can initiate RNA synthesis from both positive and negative strands, since they carry very different cis-acting elements. In this regard, it also is intriguing that specific binding of the viral polymerase precursor to the 5\u2032 end of the RNA genome is required for negative strand RNA synthesis (Gamarnik and Andino, 1998), given that initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis takes place at the opposite end of the genomic RNA. Clearly, successful initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis depends on the specific recognition of the viral RNA as a template, as well as the replication start site. Poliovirus negative strand RNA synthesis initiates within the poly(A) tail of the genomic RNA Larsen et al. 1980, Herold and Andino 2000. The poliovirus poly(A) tail is an important cis-acting element for RNA replication since removal or shortening of the poly(A) tail results in a defect in RNA replication Spector et al. 1975, Sarnow 1989, Barton et al. 1996. Furthermore, purified 3Dpol is able to uridylate the putative primer for RNA synthesis, VPg, in vitro using poly(A) as a template (Paul et al., 1998). However, the poly(A) tail cannot be the primary cis-acting element that specifies replication of the viral RNA, as all cellular mRNAs contain poly(A) at their 3\u2032 ends. One proposal is that the short 3\u2032 UTR that precedes the poly(A) tail is involved in determining template specificity (oriR) (Pilipenko et al., 1996). However, recombinant polioviruses with deleted 3\u2032 UTRs are viable, although they replicate with slower kinetics than the wild-type virus (Todd et al., 1997). Furthermore, the poliovirus 3\u2032 UTR is interchangeable with the 3\u2032 UTR of human rhinovirus 14, which is predicted to fold into a completely different structure (Rohll et al., 1995). These results suggest that the 3\u2032 UTR plays a regulatory role rather than acting as the origin of replication for negative strand RNA synthesis.",

The viral polymerase precursor 3CD binds to the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA and reaches its site of action within the poly(A) tail of the genome via circularization of the genomic RNA using an RNA\u2013protein\u2013protein\u2013RNA bridge that involves at least two cellular factors, PCBP and PABP1.

A crude cytoplasmic extract can be programmed with in vitro synthesized viral RNA. The extract contains all of the cellular components required for authentic initiation of RNA synthesis. Thus, each of the poliovirus replication intermediates and final products is correctly produced. The reaction is carried out in two steps. First, viral RNA is used to direct the synthesis of viral proteins. This reaction is performed in the presence of 2 mM guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl), a potent inhibitor of poliovirus replication that allows viral proteins to accumulate but no RNA to be synthesized. It has been proposed that structures (called preinitiation complexes) form during this step of the reaction, which, in turn, later participate in the RNA replication step. The second part is the RNA replication reaction, whereby the GuHCl is removed from the reaction mixture and radiolabeled nucleotides are used to monitor the synthesis of RNA. Since translation is uncoupled from RNA synthesis in this two-step system, the requirement for each of these steps can be examined independently.",

To release the ribosomes from the viral RNA in the absence of a 5\u2032 cloverleaf, we added puromycin to the labeling reaction. Puromycin induces translation chain termination and inhibits protein synthesis by releasing ribosomes from their RNA template. RNA synthesis was not substantially altered by puromycin when cloverleaf-containing replicon RNAs were used (Figure 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Importantly, the release of ribosomes was not sufficient to stimulate synthesis of negative strand in the cloverleaf-less RNA (Figure 1C, lane 7), although the amount of puromycin added was sufficient to completely prevent translation (Figure 1B). In addition, cloverleaf RNA added in trans did not restore replication of a cloverleaf-less replicon (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the cloverleaf is an essential cis-acting sequence that, in addition to its function in translational control, directly participates in the initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis.",

Transcripts with only 12 adenylates at their 3\u2032 ends are less efficient at producing negative stranded RNA in vitro than those with 80. To confirm and expand these results, we engineered poliovirus replicon RNAs containing a defined number of adenylate residues\u2014A0, A4, A8, A12, or A16\u2014at their 3\u2032 ends (rib[+]RLuc-A0-OH to rib[+]RLuc-A16-OH, schematized in Figures 2A and 2B). It is possible that during the course of replication, transcripts could regain long poly(A) tails by addition of adenylates at the 3\u2032 OH. To prevent this possibility, we also generated transcripts rib(+)RLuc-A1-H to rib(+)RLuc-A17-H with blocked 3\u2032 ends via incorporation of a single 3\u2032 deoxyadenosine (3\u2032-dA), which cannot accept additional nucleotides. Transcripts containing a long poly(A) tail (A16-OH or A17-H) replicated very efficiently when transfected into 293 cells and had similar kinetics regardless of whether or not the 3\u2032 end was blocked with 3\u2032-dA. In contrast, RNAs with short poly(A) tails with 3\u2032 OH ends (A4-OH) displayed a delay in replication of \u223c1\u20132 hr, but by 6 hr posttransfection, long poly(A) and short poly(A) constructs produced similar amounts of luciferase (Figure 2C). Total RNA was extracted 7 hr posttransfection and the 3\u2032 ends were analyzed. Irrespective of the length of the poly(A) of the input RNA, all RNAs contained long poly(A) tails by 7 hr posttransfection (data not shown). Thus, the delay observed in RLuc-A4-OH presumably represents the time required to increase the length of the poly(A) before replication can start. More importantly, rib(+)RLuc-A5-H with a short poly(A) and blocked 3\u2032 end was unable to replicate (Figure 2C).",

Using poly(A) homopolymers, it has been shown that \u223c12 nucleotides is the minimal length for high-affinity binding to RRM1/2, two of the RNA binding domains of mammalian PABP1 (Sachs et al., 1987). Also, it has been shown that a single RRM domain binds to poly(A) in a fashion similar to that of the entire protein. A single RRM domain and the full-length protein interact with a similar sized segment of the poly(A) and with comparable affinity. To examine the interaction of PABP1 with poly(A) in the context of the poliovirus 3\u2032 UTR, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using bacterial expressed PABP1 (PABP1-H6). We first determined the affinity of recombinant PABP1-H6 for poly(A) using a poliovirus 3\u2032 UTR with a poly(A) tail of 80 nucleotides (Figure 3A)\n. The apparent Kd was \u223c40 nM, which is higher than reported for PABP1 purified from eukaryotic cells (Gorlach et al., 1994) but closely matches what has been reported for the bacterially expressed RNA binding domains Sachs et al. 1987, Deo et al. 1999. Next, we determined the apparent Kd (see Experimental Procedures) of PABP1-H6 using poliovirus 3\u2032 UTRs with 0-, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16 nucleotide poly(A) tails (3\u2032 UTR-A0, 3\u2032 UTR-A4, 3\u2032 UTR-A8, 3\u2032 UTR-A12, and 3\u2032 UTR-A16, respectively). As expected, PABP1 was unable to interact with 3\u2032 UTR-A0 and 3\u2032 UTR-A4 probes (Figure 3B). In contrast, PABP1-H6 interacted with 3\u2032 UTR-8, 3\u2032 UTR-12, and 3\u2032 UTR-16 with high affinities. Apparent Kd values were \u223c200, \u223c100, and \u223c40 nM, respectively (Figure 3B), indicating that a minimum of eight nucleotides are required for binding and that the affinity increases as a function of the poly(A) tail length. These results are consistent with previously published observations indicating that the affinity of yeast PABP for poly(A) increases with increasing length of oligo(A) up to 12 residues (Sachs et al., 1987).",

As expected (Kuhn and Pieler, 1996), both recombinant proteins were able to bind to a poly(A)-Sepharose column (Figure 4A\n, lanes 2 and 3). To test whether proteins that bind to the poliovirus cloverleaf RNA can interact with PABP1, we incubated recombinant MBP-PCBP (PCBP2 fused to the maltose binding protein) or H6\u20133CD (His-tagged 3CD) with PABP1-H6 bound to poly(A)-Sepharose.

            "text": "To provide further evidence for the interaction of PABP1 with PCBP and 3CD, we performed mobility shift assays using the 5\u2032-terminal cloverleaf RNA as a probe. Interactions between the cloverleaf, PCBP, and 3CD control the regulation of both viral translation and RNA synthesis. Experiments have demonstrated that PCBP and 3CD specifically interact with different stem\u2013loops of the poliovirus cloverleaf structure. The cloverleaf RNA has been shown to form low-affinity complexes with either PCBP or 3CD alone. However, PCBP and 3CD together form a stable ternary RNP complex Andino et al. 1993, Parsley et al. 1997, Silvera et al. 1999. The estimated dissociation constant for the ternary complex was calculated to be \u223c1 nM. As expected, the formation of the ternary complex was not detected at low concentrations (0.5 nM) of MBP-PCBP and H6\u20133CD (Figure 4C, lane 5). However, a high-affinity complex was observed by the inclusion of PABP1-H6 in the binding reaction (lane 8). PABP1-H6 by itself does not interact with the cloverleaf RNA (Figure 4C, lanes 1\u20134), and an excess of bovine serum albumin (BSA) did not induce the formation of the high-affinity complex (Figure 4C, lanes 9\u201312). Furthermore, the complex formed by only 3CD and MBP-PCBP runs slightly faster than the complex formed by 3CD, MBP-PCBP, and PABP (Figure 4D). In summary, these results indicate that PABP1 directly interacts with PCBP and 3CD, that the proteins can interact with each other while bound to their cognate RNAs, and that PABP1 can induce the formation of a stable complex at the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA.",

Cells were harvested and treated with dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP), a reversible, cell membrane\u2013permeable cross-linker that induces ester formation of the primary amines of proteins within a range of 12 \u00c5. After washing, cells were lysed, and cytoplasmic extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against PABP1. Immunoprecipitates were heated to 100\u00b0C in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) to reverse the crosslinking and analyzed by western blotting using 3D-specific monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Figure 4, Figure 3CD coimmunoprecipitated with PABP1 (Figure 4D, lane 2). Coimmunoprecipitation of 3CD was not mediated by an RNA bridge but rather through a direct PABP1\u20133CD protein\u2013protein interaction because RNase A treatment did not reduce the amount of 3CD coimmunoprecipitated (Figure 4D, lane 4). In the absence of DSP, we were able to detect small amounts of coimmunoprecipitated 3CD, suggesting that the interaction of PABP1 with 3CD is relatively stable (Figure 4D, lanes 3 and 5). The cross-linking of PABP1 with 3CD was specific because after DSP treatment, the abundant cellular protein \u03b1-tubulin did not coimmunoprecipitate with PABP1 (Figure 4D, lanes 7\u201310). Thus, PABP1 interacts with 3CD both in vitro and in vivo in intact poliovirus-infected cells.",

A replicon RNA with a long poly(A) tail (rib[+]RLuc-A80) was incubated with 500 nM of purified recombinant \u0394PABP1-H6 or full-length recombinant PABP1 for 5 min and then used to program the translation/replication cell-free system. While the recombinant proteins had no detrimental effect on translation (Figure 5A)\n, the addition of \u0394PABP1-H6 completely abrogated RNA replication (Figure 5B, lanes 4\u20136). In contrast, the addition of recombinant PABP1-H6 did not block replication (Figure 5B, lanes 1\u20133).

Previously, we have shown that several point mutations within the cloverleaf RNA reduced both positive and negative strand RNA synthesis, with negative strand RNA synthesis being less affected, resulting in a 5- to 10-fold decrease in the ratio of plus to minus strands (Andino et al., 1990a). These results implied that mutations within the cloverleaf abrogated positive strand RNA synthesis and/or stability (Andino et al., 1990a). Recently, we have shown that the 3CD\u2013cloverleaf interaction downregulates translation to yield ribosome-free templates that could be replicated, thus implying that the cloverleaf played a role in coordinating the use of the genomic RNA for translation or RNA replication (Gamarnik and Andino, 1998). The experiments presented here suggest that the cloverleaf also plays an important direct role in negative strand RNA synthesis, as we have now shown that deletion of the entire cloverleaf results in complete inhibition of negative strand RNA synthesis. More importantly, inhibition of translation with puromycin does not promote negative strand RNA synthesis of a cloverleaf-deficient genome (Figure 1C).",

The cloverleaf is a cis active promoter element necessary for initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis to which the transcription factor binds and recruits the RNA polymerase. Thus, the cloverleaf RNA could play a central role in regulating the usage of the genome; it facilitates or inhibits translation depending on which proteins it interacts with, and it directs the synthesis of both negative and positive strand RNA (Figure 6)\n. Interestingly, it has been previously shown that an RNA structure at the 5\u2032 end of BVDV (bovine viral diarrhea virus), a pestivirus, modulates translation and replication of the positive stranded genome (Yu et al., 2000). Thus, this structure could play a role homologous to that of the cloverleaf RNA in BVDV replication.",

It has been previously shown that enzymatic removal of the poly(A) tail from virion RNA renders replication of these RNAs incompetent (Spector et al., 1975), whereas translation was not affected. Indeed, our analysis of the minimal poly(A) length required for viral replication suggests that the high-affinity interaction of the poly(A) tail with PABP1 is more critical for efficient RNA replication than for IRES-dependent translation (although minor effects on translation have been observed in vivo; Figure 2D). PABP1 is an important regulatory factor involved in the control of cellular mRNA stability and translation (reviewed by Sachs and Wahle 1993, Sachs et al. 1997). It has been shown that PABP1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4G (reviewed by Gingras et al., 1999), and because eIF4G forms a complex with the cap-recognizing eIF4E, this interaction probably leads to the effective circularization of cellular mRNAs (Figure 6A). Using purified homologous yeast proteins, this circularization has been recently visualized with atomic force microscopy (Wells et al., 1998).",
