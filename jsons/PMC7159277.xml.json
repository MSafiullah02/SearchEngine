These measures include heightened surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, followed by patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing, and follow-up of potential contacts.1 The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on each country's public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.",

We also identified that part of this heterogeneity in Africa depended on the distribution of cases within Chinese provinces. Although certain provinces in China are currently the largest contributors to the risk of specific clusters of countries, enhanced surveillance at airports should consider that importation might still occur from provinces that appear to have a lower probability in our estimations. Moreover, shifts in local and widespread transmission in Beijing, Guangdong, and Fujian could have profound implications for risk in Africa. For example, a significantly higher incidence in Guangdong than in other provinces would have a greater effect on the importation risk of countries in the second cluster than in countries in the other clusters. Flight bans implemented by some African airline companies serving China20 might alter future risk through a different repartition of the flow of travel; however, these bans are not expected to prevent importations. Not all connections between Africa and China have been cut\u2014the main transporters continue to fly between the two (eg, Ethiopian Airlines, the largest carrier in Africa, operating almost half of the flights from Africa to China,21 together with all Chinese airline companies, and others). Previous and current evidence indicates that realistic travel restrictions would have a limited effect in containing the epidemic and would delay the risk that the outbreak extends to new countries by only a few weeks.8, 22, 23 Travel or trade restrictions are not currently recommended by WHO.1\n",

In our assessment, we accounted for the distribution of incidence within China and the volume of travel from China with the passenger network. This assessment strongly affects the spatial pattern in the risk of importation. In addition, we considered full origin\u2013destination itineraries as opposed to direct flights only. Yet our data do not allow us to distinguish between travel for tourism or business, or across nationalities of passengers. Contrary to Europe, where most cases among initial importations were Chinese tourists travelling for holiday, cases in Africa might be more likely to be business than travel related, given the strong commercial links between African countries and China.",

In the African region, this capacity has now expanded from just two referral laboratories4 to a larger set of countries, and is expected to continue to increase in the upcoming weeks.25 The capacity of these laboratories is still limited by the shortage of personnel trained to run the tests, and inadequate stock of materials needed to do these tests.
