Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA \u03b2-coronavirus belonging to the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) viruses, which causes pneumonia, requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10% of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. COVID-19 is characterized in severe cases by an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine release syndrome and there is an immediate need for any agent before the development of a vaccine [2]. To date, there is no registered molecule for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, there are ongoing trials on the use of some anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs that have demonstrated efficacy on COVID-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in small cases series [7]. Certainly, previous experiences on viruses belonging to the same \u03b2-coronavirus family have formed the cornerstones of the current therapeutic strategy [8,9]. The emergency facing the scientific community in addressing the pandemic from COVID-19 provides the rationale for the use of drugs that have not yet been approved and with still preliminary scientific evidence. So far, therapeutic regimes include a combination of anti-viral drugs and supportive care.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a pro-inflammatory status characterized by high levels of different cytokines, including interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20101R\u03b1, IL-2, IL\u201010, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Critically ill patients requiring admission to intense care unit (ICU) display markedly high concentration of IL-2, IL-10, G-CSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6. Interestingly, levels of IL-6 also correlated with increased mortality. Moreover, in severe COVID-19, a reduction of natural killer cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and IFN\u03b3 expression in CD4+ cells, has been observed. Levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF\u03b1 inversely correlates with lymphocyte count, suggesting that the cytokine release syndrome may hamper the adaptative immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection [10,11]. Moreover, high levels of ferritin were demonstrated in patients requiring ICU hospitalization [2]. This provided rational for the use of several anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatments for this severe viral infection, while other preliminary experiments suggested a direct anti-viral effect of some of them at least in vitro. For instance, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are currently used to face COVID-19 [12]. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has been used with encouraging results in particularly ill patients since a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, by may occurs in lung epithelium in severe cases [13]. Trials to test the efficacy of Tocilizumab on severe COVID-19 patients are ongoing [14,15] (Table 1\n).",

For instance, in RA patients the use of 7.5 mg or more of daily prednisone can increase the risk of infection requiring hospitalization up to six times than in the control group [29,30]. On the other hand, an improved RA disease activity achievable with glucocorticoids is associated with lower serious infection rates [31]. Moreover, these drugs appear to be independent predictors of infection-related hospitalization [32]. Although most of the GC-related reported infections are bacterial, viral infections have been reported too, primarily represented by HSV and HBV reactivation [25,33]. The most debating question is the possible usage of GCs during COVID-19 pandemic and, in case, which, at which disease stage, and at which dosage/administration route. Hydrocortisone showed to improve respiratory and mortality outcome in bacterial severe community-acquired pneumonia [34] and inconstant efficacy in septic shock [35,36]. Budesinide might reduce post viral-inflammatory-cytokine production by human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro [37], while discordant results are reported in viral influenza pneumonia.",

As reported in a recent Cochrane analysis, these data are predominantly based on observational studies and mostly of low quality [46,48]. In fact, Li et al. observed in a prospective trial, that the use of low to moderate dose of GCs on 2141 patient infected by H1N1 virus, 54.2% complicated by ARDS, significantly reduced both 30 and 60-day mortality (aHR 0.49 [95% CI 0.32\u20130.77] (aHR 0.51 [95% CI 0.33\u20130.78]) [49]. Analysing the outcome of MERS-CoV infected patients treated with GCs, Arabi et al. did not find a rise in death rates correlated to the use of the drug but found delayed lower respiratory tract clearance of MERS-CoV RNA [50]. Equally, the use of GCs seemed to protract SARS-CoV viral clearance [[51], [52], [53]].",

Acetaminophen belongs to NSAIDs but its effects on COX activity remain controversial being a weak, reversible, isoform-nonspecific COX inhibitor [57]. The COX-2 is an important mediator of inflammation in response to viral infection, and it contributes to viral replication, for CMV, HCV, and viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family.

Interestingly, the tumorigenic potential of COX-2 and PGE2 through eicosanoid receptors is described in several viral associated malignancies such as the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus and support COX-2 as a therapeutic target with an antineoplastic purpose [60]. Several years ago, authors have shown that the spike protein of SARS-CoV activated the COX-2 expression via ERK/NF-kB and PI3K/JNK pathways [61]. These studies provided key findings on molecular mechanisms involved in the viral infection and the induction of inflammation by SARS-CoV. Few data on the inhibitory effects of Ibuprofen on ACE2 were reported in animal models [62].",

A phase 3 clinical trial is ongoing to explore the efficacy of addition of naproxen in the standard treatment of critical patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [65]. However, since the use of both NSAIDs and acetaminophen could be associated with a masking of the symptoms during COVID-19, and thus to a diagnostic delay and a prolonged illness, complications may be more common when NSAIDs are used\u2014both respiratory and cardiovascular [66]. In patients with acute respiratory infection, NSAIDs have been widely used and evidence suggests that in these circumstances NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction [[67], [68], [69]]. Moreover, large randomized trials support that NSAIDs may cause more prolonged illness or complications when taken during respiratory tract infections [70,71]. Patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of hospitalization, critical disease and mortality correlated with age and presence of comorbidities, particularly hypertension. Thus, besides further research evidence relating specifically to people with COVID-19 are awaited, regular symptomatic NSAIDs use should not be recommended as the first line option for managing COVID-19 [72,73].",

The mechanisms of action are still not fully elucidated, nonetheless some important aspects are well known. CQ is a weak base with a large distribution volume and accumulates at high concentrations in almost all body tissues, including the lungs [75]. After oral administration, it is efficiently absorbed and is present in the blood mainly as a protonated molecule. However, the circulating unprotonated portion can easily cross cell membranes and, due to its basic charge, tends to accumulate in acidic organelles such as lysosomes, Golgi vesicles and endosomes, where it binds to free protons, thus significantly increasing the pH. Thus, a large number of enzymes contained in these organelles, which optimally work in the acidic milieu, are inhibited [76,77]. This mechanism is presumably at the basis of the direct anti-parasitic, anti-viral, and immunomodulatory effects of the molecule. Although most of the evidence in this field regards CQ, there are some data showing similar effects by HCQ. Additionally, current data support that the mechanism of action of the two molecules is equivalent and HCQ appears to be significantly less toxic and has almost completely replaced the use of CQ in the treatment of rheumatic diseases [77,78].",

Interestingly, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) doses range between 1 and 10 \u03bcM, that are easily and safely reachable in humans [79,80]. In addition to the mechanisms described above, CQ seems to inhibit the glycosylation process of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, which may have an effect on the affinity of SARS-CoV for its receptor, further contributing to the inhibition of virus cell entry [80]. Another possible effect through interfering with the bond between PICALM (phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein) and clathrin impeding the endocytosis of the virus. Other in vitro data demonstrated that CQ, probably through its pH-dependent enzyme inhibitory effect, can significantly hamper phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), thus, blocking replication of the human coronavirus HcoV-229E, similarly to a selective inhibitor of the same enzyme [81] (Fig. 1\n).",

The risk of retinal toxicity in patients treated for 10 years with HCQ for SLE was shown to be around 7.5% and higher in patients treated for longer periods [92]. In the COVID-19 associated acute infection, CQ and HCQ are used for a very short time (5\u201320 days according to expert consensus) [88,93], with a probably negligible risk of adverse events. Nevertheless, acute adverse events, such as hypersensitivity and gastrointestinal intolerance, require attention, especially in critically ill patients that may develop similar clinical manifestations due to COVID-19. Additionally, CQ and HCQ can be safely used during pregnancy [94]. Nonetheless, the ideal dose regimen has not been established yet and most guidelines suggest the same protocols used in rheumatology, i.e. 500 mg BID of CQ or 200 mg BID of HCQ, including those from China and Italy [88,93]. Although clinical trials in vivo are needed to found the best dosing regimen, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model suggested a loading dose of HCQ 400 mg BID on the first day, followed by 200 mg BID in the next four days, which should allow to maintain an appropriate plasma concentration up to ten days [83].",

The most important is against cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in solid organ transplant recipients. The American Society of Transplantation and the Transplantation Society International CMV Consensus Group reported LEF as a possible alternative or experimental therapy in case of extensive resistance to standard anti-viral treatment [100]. Even though randomized controlled trial are lacking, numerous case reports described the efficacy of LEF in treating drug-resistant CMV systemic and ocular infections, or in preventing the recurrence of viremia in transplant patients [101]. In one case report and in a retrospective study, LEF (100 mg for 5 days followed by a maintenance dose of 20 mg every 12 h) resulted to be effective in clearing low-dose viremia and long-term CMV suppression in lung transplantation. It must be noted that this small cohort was already taking other anti-viral agents [102]. Three case reports described that LEF could be able to induce a persistent clearance of CMV UL97 and UL54 (genes of resistance against classical anti-viral therapy) in serum and clinical resolution in transplant patients complicated by active CMV retinitis resistant to treatment with systemic and intra-vitreal foscarnet, ganciclovir and oral valganciclovir [103,104]. Other case reports in hemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients described the use of LEF, alone or in combination with other anti-viral drugs as a salvage therapy for recalcitrant CMV infection, with variable results [105]. In addition, LEF was reported in the treatment of acyclovir-resistant perianal Herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) infection in HIV patients [106].",

In fact, even restoring pyrimidine nucleotide triphosphates to normal levels, viral replication is persistently impaired. LEF reduces the in vitro spreading of CMV and HSV-1 infection by interfering with virion cytoplasmatic assembly in a dose-dependent manner [107,108]. This action appears independent of the levels of pyNTP and persists also in CMV strain D16 usually resistant to the action of ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet [109]. In particular, the drug induces failure to acquire tegument and external membrane in the cytoplasm of infected cells. It has been proposed that LEF may interfere with tegument assembly by inhibiting protein phosphorylation of the phosphoproteins [107]. Thus, its anti-viral activity, specifically against CMV and HSV-1, occurs at a late stage of viral assembly, in contrast with traditional anti-CMV agents that inhibit viral DNA replication [110]. Viral protein synthesis does not seem to be affected, while two different studies reported discordant results on the viral DNA production Data from in vivo experiments document that LEF is able in reducing viral load in nude rats [107,108]. LEF can significantly reduce CMV-induced apoptosis of the infected cells, interfering with the spreading of the virus [111]. Bilger et al. showed that teriflunomide can have a role against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [112]. Drug concentrations lower than those normally used for treatment of RA can prevent EBV-transformed human B cell proliferation thanks to an \u201con target\u201d mechanism on B cells and an \u201coff target\u201d action that alter EBV latency protein expression. In fact, an increased expression of EBV nuclear antigen-2 (EBNA2) and latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1), the latter able to inhibit B cell proliferation, were observed [112]. Furthermore, teriflunomide induces expression of p53 and cleavage level of PARP, promoting apoptosis of lymphocytes in vitro. No reduction of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-kB) signaling by teriflunomide was reported in this setting. The drug can inhibit lytic EBV infection in vitro by preventing the initial steps of lytic viral reactivation by reducing immediate-early lytic protein and early lytic protein expression, in response to B-cell receptor, and by blocking lytic viral DNA replication [112].",

Small case series and a prospective open-label trial analyzed the effect of LEF, used alone or in combination with other drugs (tacrolimus/everolimus, fluoroquinolones), in PVAN; they described a partial success in viremia clearance or better renal outcome [[117], [118], [119]].

Similarly, MMF inhibits viral RNA, mRNA protein synthesis, and it almost completely blocks virus entry and cytopathic effect of human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV-2), but these restrictions are recovered by guanosine and S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6- thioinosine administration [156]. The only evidence of the presence of another antiviral mechanism of MMF derives from a study on hepatitis C virus (HCV). It seems that the drug is able to inhibit in vitro and in vivo the virus replication by augmentation of IFN-stimulated gene expression [157], suppressing HuH-7 cell autophagy, decreasing autophagosome formation, and increasing p62 level expression in vitro [158]. MERS-CoV caused several fatal infections in the Middle East and traveler-associated cases in Europe and Africa with over 35% fatality since its emergence in 2012 [159]. A clinical retrospective analysis on 51 patients infected by MERS-CoV showed that treatment with MMF was one of the predictors of increased survival [160]. MA together with disulfiram and/or 6-thioguanine seemed able to synergistically inhibit MERS-CoV papain-like protease PLpr [161]. Chan et al. found that a concentration \u22640.063 \u03bcg/ml of MMF inhibited cytopathic effects, reduced the viral load and achieved a 100% plaque reduction in Vero cells infected. The combination of MA and IFN-1\u03b2 showed synergistic activity [162]. Despite these evidences, the same author observed that MMF and MA were ineffective in coronaviridae-infected-animal models. In fact, in one study all MERS-CoV-infected marmosets treated with MMF developed severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads than the untreated animals, and higher mortality than the ones treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-1\u03b2 [163]. Barnard et al. found the drug unable in preventing viral replication in the lungs of SARS-infected BALB/c mice, although it did not significantly increase it, as ribavirin did [164]; the same inefficacy against SARS-CoV replication has been previously reported [165].",

MA increases the anti-HBV activity of penciclovir, lobucavir, 37-fluorodideoxyguanosine, diaminopurine dioxolane [167,168]. Similar results have been obtained with the combination of MMF with other classical anti-viral drugs, such as abacavir, didanosine and tenofovir, treating HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV and others [[169], [170], [171], [172], [173], [174], [175], [176]]. All these evidences could allow the clinician to use of MMF as a support-drug of other anti-viral drug, in specifically clinical contest, even thou the lack of in vivo clinical trial. This is a strong limitation, considering that frequently in vitro activity does not correspond to a satisfactory action in vivo. Nevertheless, MMF is a strong immunosuppressive agent, it reduces the immunity response to vaccination in transplant patients [177], and it is associated with increased risk of viral infections from human herpesvirus 6, herpes zoster (HZ) and CMV [178,179], although data remain inconclusive [180,181].",

MTX thus limits the viability of highly replicating cells. Moreover, MTX-induced reactive oxygen species generation modulates different cell functions, such as suppression of cytokine production and cell proliferation decreasing TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and adhesion molecules (E-selectin and VCAM-1) [183].",

            "text": "One of the oldest know drugs so far in the field of rheumatology is Colchicine. This is an inexpensive, orally administered, potent anti-inflammatory medication that was initially extracted from the autumn crocus and has been used for centuries [189]. Its mechanisms of actions are through the inhibition of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation and, possibly, effects on cellular adhesion molecules, inflammatory chemokines, and the inflammasome [190,191]. Colchicine is currently indicated for the treatment of gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and pericarditis [[192], [193], [194]]. Indeed, this agent is the main treatment of several rheumatic conditions [195] in which the activation of the inflammasome and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines are the key pathogenic events. It alters the organization of actin cytoskeleton by binding to tubulin monomers and inhibits polymer formation [196]. Colchicine drug has shown anti-inflammatory effects, more pronounced on the IL-1 and IL-6 axis. It is highly concentrated in neutrophils and macrophages prolonging its action [197]. Its ability to bind tubulin achieves multiple cellular actions, including inhibition of the assembly of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome [198]. In addition to its effect on neutrophils [199,200], colchicine impairs the release of IL-1\u03b2 into neutrophil extracellular traps [201]. Many of the actions have been demonstrated in patients with coronary disease [202,203]. Colchicine blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome, a cytosolic complex responsible for the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, in which IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and downstream IL-6 that are key inflammatory cytokines, colchicine administration was able to significantly reduce transcoronary gradients of all 3 cytokines in by 40%\u201388% [204]. A similar reduction in IL-6 but also in IL-8 or TNF-\u03b1 levels can be observed in mucocutaneous Behcet's disease patients [205]. Moreover, colchicine has anti-viral properties against Flaviviridae and against the recombinant demyelinating strain of mouse hepatitis virus RSA59 as demonstrated reducing virus replication since microtubules are crucial in cell entry and blocking neuronal transport [206,207]. It inhibits RSV replication reducing IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels [208]. Some studies have suggested that colchicine and colchicine derivatives may have some influence HIV viral load [209]. Certain subsets of the 2003-SARS coronavirus replication machinery have been shown to move in the cell in a manner that corresponds with microtubule-associated transport, inducing the formation of double-membrane vesicles in infected cells. SARS-CoV-2 is a similar virus to SARS-CoV and microtubule disruption may influence viral replication [210]. It was also documented that SARS-CoV and its accessory protein are potent activators of pro-IL-1\u03b2 gene transcription and protein maturation, and thus are able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and that influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus 2B proteins stimulate IL-1\u03b2 secretion following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [211], thus making colchicine a promising treatment for these conditions.",

            "text": "Indeed, acute respiratory syndrome related to COVID-19-infection is associated with a wide release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin IL-1 and IL-6 [212]. Specifically, the binding of COVID-19 to the toll like receptors leads to the lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Thus, it might be useful to obtain a suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and IL-6 to reach a therapeutic effect in viral infections. Moreover, a dysregulated activation and inflammatory activity of myeloid cells is one the main pathogenic events characterizing the infection by coronaviruses [213,214]. Colchicine is a well- known inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory mechanisms induced by neutrophils thus it was proposed as an adjuvant treatment for RSV bronchiolitis [15]. Thus, colchicine has broad anti-inflammatory effects, anti-viral properties summarized in Fig. 2\n, and it is not hampered by an immunosuppressant effect. It is cheap, which may be of great usefulness in the uneventful case of an outbreak in countries that may not sustain expensive biologic treatments. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index; gastrointestinal disturbance may be seen in up to 10% of patients possibly limiting its usage in COVID-19 due to the relatively frequent occurrence of diarrhea in these patients. Nonetheless, potential intravenous administration may reduce this side effect and increase its bioavailability. It could be suggested that colchicine may be trialed in an appropriate COVID-19 patient population to reduce both viral entry and inflammatory status. In this view, an open-label, phase 2 study enrolling patients with COVID-19 disease to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine has been recently promoted by the Italian Society of Rheumatology (SIR), the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (SIMIT) and by the Italian Thoracic Society (AIPO) and has been approved by the Italian Drug Agency (AIFA).",

IL-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a key role in inflammation, immunity, and hemopoiesis. The major of IL-1 agonistic molecules are IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which bind to IL-1R type I (IL-1R1) inducing similar biologic functions. The precursor of IL-1\u03b1 (ProIL-1\u03b1) is constitutively expressed in several tissue cells and its expression increases during stress or inflammation, whereas IL-1\u03b2 is produced mainly by myeloid cells upon inflammatory stimulation and is active as a secreted molecule [216]. IL-1\u03b2 is up-regulated during respiratory viral infections. Interestingly, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) observed in children below 5 years of age in India has been related to a phenotype-genotype association with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Specifically, IL-1RA gene polymorphism and cytokine levels were linked with an adverse outcome in severe CAP [217].",

The objective of IL\u20101Ra\u2013based therapy is to occupy enough IL\u20101 receptors with IL\u20101Ra to block IL\u20101 cell signaling [222]. Rilonacept and Canakinumab are other molecules currently used in clinical practice to treat autoinflammatory diseases. Rilonacept is a long-acting soluble decoy receptor that binds to both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and prevents their interaction with the IL-1 cell surface receptor [223]. It was approved in 2008 for the treatment of adults and children 12 years of age and older with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Canakinumab is a fully human anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibody that is used in the therapy of AOSD and other autoinflammatory conditions. Evidence documented that the control of the inflammation achieved with this drug, targeting the IL-1\u03b2 innate immunity pathway, can reduce inflammatory tissue damage as it is demonstrated in cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and diabetes [224]. Currently, no evidence of anti-viral properties of these drugs exists but, as widely described, SARS-CoV is capable of inducing a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines [225]. Several studies suggest that cells infected by SARS-CoV produce elevated levels of IL-1 \u03b2 which strongly contribute to the immuno-mediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in acute lung injury (ALI) and, subsequently, multi-organ dysfunction. Therefore, the application of IL-1 \u03b2 antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection [226].",

Moreover, the use of infliximab totally abrogates the anti-rotavirus effect of TNF-\u03b1 [235]. TNFi have potent activity in several diseases marked by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokine. That effect may prove useful in viral infections highly characterized by immune activation and inflammation such as HIV-1 infections. HIV-1 infection results in the depletion of CD4+/CD8+T cells with abnormalities in the cytokine network in the infected individuals. HIV-1 uses the TNF\u03b1 signaling for expanding its reservoir. Several HIV-1 proteins mimic and regulate the TNF-\u03b1 signaling pathway. Thus, TNFi has been considered as an additional therapeutic option for HIV-1 infection [[236], [237], [238]]. Evidence shows that TNF-\u03b1 is a key mediator of virus-induced M\u2082 muscarinic receptor dysfunction and airway hyper-responsiveness in influenza infected-animals [239]. Interestingly, in this model etanercept has been shown to be able in preventing virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and M\u2082 receptor dysfunction, without changing lung viral titres. Nonetheless, all these data do not support enough the use of these molecules as anti-viral drugs. The only potential beneficial mechanism in COVID-19 patients could be reduction of TNF levels that appears to be increased especially in the critical stages. Moreover, a possible role in COVID-19 is the interaction with the ACE2 receptor. Indeed, SARS-CoV-related severe respiratory distress sees associated with the ability of the spike protein of SARS-CoV to down-regulate ACE2 expression [240]. In addition, SARS-CoV modulates with its spike protein the TNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE)- activity by via the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 leading to both the viral entry and the only potential beneficial mechanism in tissue damage through TNF-\u03b1 production [241]. Since the downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV spike protein was proposed as an etiological event in the severe lung injury, authors previously suggested that TACE antagonists can block SARS-CoV infection and attenuate the severe clinical outcome [242]. Other studies confirmed the role of TNF\u03b1 in promoting pathogenesis in SARS-CoV infection through its receptors and suggested that inhibition of TNF\u03b1 signaling may represent viable chance for effective therapies [243]. Accordingly, evidence reports markedly higher serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 together with IL2R, IL-6, IL-10, in severe than in moderate cases of COVID-19 [244]. A phase 4 randomized, open-label, controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of Adalimumab especially in those patients with particularly elevated TNF levels in the critical stages with severe COVID-19 is ongoing in Shanghai with the main outcome of Time to Clinical Improvement [245].",

IL-6 stimulates acute-phase immune response and hematopoiesis and it is involved in the complex pathogenesis of autoimmune disease like RA, Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA), and of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS is a possible consequence of the administration of chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells (CAR-T) immunotherapy, recently approved for the treatment of B-cell leukemias and lymphomas [[246], [247], [248], [249]]. Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6 receptor, is capable to reduce and control the effects of the abnormal production of IL-6 and is approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of RA and these diseases [250]. CRS related to CAR-T therapy can be caused directly by the infused CAR-T cells or through the activation of other immune cells and usually manifests with a clinical presentation that can range from a smolder condition to a multiple organ failure [251]. Since COVID-19 has some clinical similarities eventually progressing in the 15% of cases in ARDS, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney disease requiring ICU monitoring and a key role seems played by IL-6 that is markedly elevated along with TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-10, IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage\u2013colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), the use of Tocilizumab (IV 8 mg/kg i.v.) was proposed [[252], [253], [254]].",

A randomized controlled clinical trial is actually undergoing in China and another has been started in Italy, as abovementioned. Tocilizumab has already been used in the past weeks as an off-label drug in the absence of a specific therapy for the treatment of severe manifestations of COVID (ICU and not-ICU patients) in Italy during the epidemic outbreak that is leading to an emergency situation with more than 4000 victims [12,13]. Notably, another anti-IL6 drug is currently available for the treatment of RA, Sarilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor. Tocilizumab is available both IV as well as subcutaneously, while Sarilumab only subcutaneously, possibly limiting its usage due to the slower effect in an acute scenario as that of ARDS or pre-ARDS from SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

This process has been recently proposed by Fu et al. as a possible mechanism of lung damage in SARS-CoV pneumonia [277]. In particular, the viral surface antigen S-host antibodies (anti-Spike IgG) complex promotes the FcR-mediated internalization of the virus in macrophages (ADE) and activates intracellular signaling of FcR. This interaction results in the up-regulation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible for severe lung disease. Moreover, it was observed that the appearance of anti-viral IgG coincided in 80% of patients with the onset of acute respiratory disease [278]. The same study identified IVIg as an agent able to saturate FcR and possibly prevent the lung damage in SARS-CoV infection [279]. Despite a systematic review of SARS treatment showed inconclusive results in a retrospective analysis of IVIg treated patients, a possible therapeutic role of IVIg in COVID-19 could be hypothesized [280].",

Generally, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 would be considerably upregulated by viral infections: studies found that distinct anti-viral activities correlate with virus-specific expression levels of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) subsets. For instance, some ISGs have strong anti-viral effects while others promote viral replication in vitro [283]. Macrophages produce significant levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, chemokines, and IL-18 [284]. Dendritic cells (DCs), especially plasmacytoid DCs, respond to virus infections dose dependently by inducing high expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 or on the contrary by a rapid pDC apoptosis. Moreover, IFN-\u03b1 downregulates IFN-\u03b3 production by NK and CD8+ T cells through IL-10 production, leading to a rapid induction of an adaptive immune response [285].",

Intriguingly, baricitinib inhibits the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) that is a regulator of endocytosis that the SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect lung cells through binding with ACE2. This may possibly interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and also the intracellular assembly of virus particles. Baricitinib, at therapeutic dosing (either as 2 mg or 4 mg once daily) is sufficient to inhibit AAK1, thus it has been suggested to be trialed in an appropriated COVID population [6,292]. On the other hand, therapies targeting JAK complexes may interfere with normal anti-viral response including inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 activity and may potentially increase the risk of infection and/or reactivation of several viral infectious diseases [[293], [294], [295]], including a dose dependent risk for VZV observed for tofacitinib and baricitinib [296]. Thus, their usage should be carefully evaluated.

Very interestingly, high levels of CD4+ cells expressing both GM-CSF and IL-6 were found in COVID-19 patients, along with GM\u2013CSF\u2013secreting CD14+CD16+, compared to healthy controls. Even more intriguingly, Th1 cells expressing both GM-CSF and IFN-\u03b3 were detected exclusively in ICU patients, thus suggesting a potential contribution of GM-CSF to CRS [300]. These data are further supported by the evidence that human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) are able to secrete GM-CSF following an inflammatory stimulus such as LPS, suggesting a potential important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, in which increased levels of GM-CSF are present in BAL fluid [301]. Additionally, animal models have demonstrated that GM-CSF neutralization is effective in reducing the severity of neuroinflammation induced by CAR-T therapy, with no negative effect on its efficacy [302].",

SARS-CoV-2 binds to the host-cell with several receptors, among which is angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 and PICALM through interaction of the spike (S) glycoprotein. Virus entry into the host cell can occur through fusion with the surface of the host cell, with the subsequent release of the genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 can enter the host cell through the formation of endocytic vesicles, and genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm following fusion with the vesicle membrane (not shown). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can alter the glycosylation process of ACE-2, which may have an effect on the affinity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, chloroquine can interfere with the bond between PICALM and clathrin impeding the endocytosis of the virus. Finally, chloroquine may alter the pH of the lysosome blocking replication of the virus.",
