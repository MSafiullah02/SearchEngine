Serologic investigation would have been a reliable method to reach the same diagnosis, albeit with the limitations that the results would not be known for several weeks, and laboratory costs could be higher. A third option would involve laboratory testing of samples obtained from live animals, such as nasal swabs or transtracheal washes. Although this can achieve a rapid diagnosis and has the flexibility of being based on few or many samples, it is a riskier option because most respiratory viral infections are transient, and testing therefore requires collection of samples early in the course of disease. Practitioners may not examine the herd until this early stage of infection has passed, whereas in large or extensively managed groups it may not be known which animals have most recently developed disease.",

            "text": "Key elements of the postmortem examination are outlined in Box 1\n. Veterinarians are faced with too many respiratory diseases to remember the features of each, so classification of lung diseases into morphologic patterns is helpful for diagnostic recognition of diseases, for understanding the pathogenesis and relationships between cause and clinical signs, and for predicting the chronic sequelae that may be seen in survivors. Pathologists vary in their exact categorization of pulmonary lesions and in the terminology applied, but the following system is broadly used. The main morphologic patterns, gross appearances, and causes are summarized in Table 3\nand illustrated in Fig. 1\nA\u2013H).Box 1Gross pathologic examination in cases of respiratory disease\nA. Lesions in other body systemsPostmortem examination in cases of respiratory disease must not only focus on the respiratory system but also search for clues in other body systems.\u2022Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an important predisposing cause of bacterial pneumonia, so oral and esophageal erosions and Peyer patch necrosis should be actively sought at necropsy. However, many BVDV-infected calves have no gross lesions.\u2022Heart disease causes pulmonary edema with dyspnea and hyperpnea, and the prosector should search for abscesses or infarcts in the left ventricular papillary muscle caused by Histophilus somni, for bacterial endocarditis of the valves, and for congenital anomalies.\u2022Heart lesions may not be detected grossly and the diagnosis may depend on histologic evidence of myocarditis caused by BVDV or on myocardial necrosis resulting from toxin exposure or white muscle disease. In cases of respiratory distress in which a reliable diagnosis is not achieved by gross necropsy examination, formalin-fixed samples of heart (and other tissues) should always be included in the diagnostic investigation. For example, we recognize a fatal condition in feedlot cattle with mild bronchopneumonia as the only gross lesion, but lymphocytic necrotizing arteritis attributed to BVDV infection is obvious if multiple sections of lung, heart, and other organs are examined histologically.\u2022When opening the pulmonic valve, continue the incision to open the main branches of the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary emboli\u2014a cause of either peracute or chronic disease\u2014are routinely overlooked if this important step is neglected (see Fig. 1F).\n\nB. Examination of the upper airways\u2022The pluck\u2014tongue, larynx, esophagus, trachea, lungs, and heart\u2014should be removed at the time of necropsy. If the lungs are only examined in situ, unilateral lesions will be overlooked, and it is unlikely that the upper respiratory tract and heart will be effectively examined. Evaluation of the nasal cavity requires sectioning with a saw or axe. Examination of the upper respiratory tract may reveal miscellaneous causes of inspiratory dyspnea, including laryngeal lesions of diphtheria, focal masses obstructing airflow, or cellulitis of the head or neck.\u2022In infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), the primary viral infection typically causes nonfatal febrile illness with respiratory distress; fatalities generally result from secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia. Lesions of tracheal erosion are essentially pathognomonic of IBR. In cases of bacterial bronchopneumonia, expectorated mucus, pus, or fibrin covers the tracheal mucosa and can easily be mistaken for lesions of IBR. However, this material is easily wiped from the tracheal mucosa, revealing a smooth intact mucosa, whereas cases of IBR have adherent exudate or multifocal pale areas of mucosal necrosis. Nevertheless, in autolyzed cases, this distinction can be problematic.\u2022Examination of the large airways should not end at the tracheal bifurcation and must persevere to the bronchi in the caudal lung. Adult Dictyocaulus worms preferentially reside in these caudal bronchi (see Fig. 1H), and finding these worms provides an immediate and high-impact diagnosis that may forestall hundreds of dollars of laboratory testing.\n\nC. Examination of the lungsIn many cases, the lungs hold the important clues that direct subsequent investigation, but some misleading changes must be recognized.\u2022Red discoloration of lung tissue commonly results from postmortem pooling of blood as veins dilate after death. Visible reddening indicates specific areas of the lung that should be carefully palpated and perhaps sampled histologically. However, diffuse or patchy red discoloration throughout the lung is usually a postmortem artifact, and localized discoloration with no change in texture should be interpreted with much caution. The dorsocaudal lung of cattle is normally white and opaque because the pleura in this area is thick and fibrous, but this must not be mistaken for an abnormality (see Fig. 1C, E). Interlobular and subpleural emphysema, appearing as lines of air-filled bubbles separating the lobules, arises commonly in cattle that are dyspneic for any reason (see Fig. 1C, D). Pulmonary emphysema occurs without other lung disease, for example in downer cows dying of toxic mastitis or hypocalcemia, but it is a clue to look for more diagnostically specific lesions such as firmness of the individual lung lobules that separate the emphysematous interlobular septa.\u2022Palpation\u2014the key to effective examination of the lung\u2014must be based on a cut section of lung because the thick pleura is a barrier to effective palpation. Superficial palpation is useless, and the fingers must push deeply, like microscopic probes assessing the texture of each individual lobule. It is useful to categorize the abnormal lung texture on a 5-point scale that often correlates with the morphologic pattern of lung disease:\u25cbHard and crisp, as a result of peracute fibrinous bronchopneumonia\u25cbFirm or liver-like, as a result of acute or chronic bronchopneumonia\u25cbSlightly firm or rubbery, as a result of bronchointerstitial or interstitial pneumonia\u25cbWet and heavy, but of essentially normal texture, as a result of edema\u25cbSpongier than normal, as a result of air trapping from airway obstruction or emphysema\n\u2022The distribution and the texture of the lung lesions are the basis for identifying the morphologic pattern of disease (see Table 3).\n",

Ideally, tissues should be collected from multiple animals that are reliably representative of the disease problem in the herd, early in the disease course, and not treated. This is often impossible for small herds of valuable animals, for which necropsy-based investigations must rely on the few animals that have died despite attempted therapy. In such cases, histopathologic examination often reveals lesions that suggest viral or bacterial pneumonia, yet the specific pathogen cannot be identified because it has been eliminated by the immune response or antimicrobial therapy. The lung is vast, and multiple (3\u20135) samples harvested from the various areas will increase the frequency of diagnosis. Foci of caseous necrosis are ideal for detection of Mycoplasma bovis, and granulomas are sites of M bovis infection, but abscesses are of no value in identifying the primary bacterial pathogen.Box 2Selection of animals for sampling\n\u2022Examine multiple animals.\u2022Animals should be selected that are representative of the disease problem with respect to clinical signs, age, and pen grouping. Ensure that the expensive investigation is not conducted on those that have died of other causes.\u2022Examine early in disease course, at the onset of clinical signs. Experimental studies suggest that animals in the first 1\u20134 days of clinical illness are most likely to shed virus (with virus detectable at 4\u20137 days after infection for bovine respiratory syncytial virus [BRSV] and other viruses).18, 19, 20 An absence of fever suggests that the animal is not likely to have active respiratory viral infection, but the converse is not true: animals may remain febrile after the pathogen has been cleared, for example, if there is secondary bacterial pneumonia. Serum haptoglobin and other acute phase proteins (APPs) remain elevated throughout the duration of the inflammatory response and thus do not necessarily indicate acute disease. Using APPs to select affected animals for testing is also currently constrained by the delay needed for laboratory testing.\u2022Examine animals that were not treated with antibiotics, if identification of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility is desirable.\nBox 3Tissue sampling at necropsy\nSelection of tissue samples\u2022Unless there is considerable confidence in the diagnosis at the time of necropsy, it is recommended to submit nonrespiratory tissues as part of the respiratory disease investigation. Examples of significant microscopic lesions in nonrespiratory tissues include myocardial lesions causing heart failure and dyspnea, lymphocytic arteritis in the heart or depletion of lymphoid tissue as a result of BVDV infection, intestinal lesions as a result of bovine coronavirus (BCV) or BVDV, and various inflammatory lesions as the basis for febrile illnesses that may mimic bacterial pneumonia.\u2022\nUpper respiratory tract samples should be taken: nasal cavity, larynx, and trachea.\u25cbNasal swabs are effective for identification of respiratory viruses, including BRSV, bovine parainfluenza virus-1 (BPI3V), bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), and BCV.\u25cbBacteria isolated from nasal swabs are not well correlated with those from the lung, although there is some controversy in the literature on this point: isolates are the same species only 68% of the time and may be present in nasal swabs without causing disease, yet antimicrobial sensitivity of isolates seem to be similar in both locations.21, 22, 23\n\n\u2022Sampling of lung tissue\u25cbHistopathology and immunohistochemistry: Sample at least 3\u20135 areas, including samples from the border between abnormal and normal lung and a sample from normal lung. Samples must cover the spectrum of lesions in the lung; for example, a single lung may have cranioventral consolidation, abscesses, dorsocaudal interstitial pneumonia, and pleuritis, and all should be examined histologically.\u25cbVirology: Take 2 samples from the cranioventral lung and 1 from the dorsocaudal lung. Viral antigen and nucleic acid are of nonuniform distribution, and some cases have BRSV in the cranioventral but not the caudodorsal lung.24, 25\n\u25cbBacterial culture: Sample consolidated lung tissue near the border between abnormal and normal lung, avoiding abscesses. Bacterial pathogens are most reliably detected in consolidated lung tissue near the junction with normal lung. This represents the anatomic site that has most recently become infected, whereas the older lesions in the cranioventral area are more likely to be colonized by secondary pathogens. Samples of lung tissue should be \u22654 cm in diameter. Compared with swabs taken in the field, contamination of lung tissue samples may be less likely if a tissue block is submitted, because the surface is seared in the laboratory before sampling for culture. Conversely, swabs have the advantage of ease of use and improved preservation during transport.\u25cb\nM bovis: Foci of caseous necrosis are ideal, or areas of consolidation.\u25cbTuberculosis: Caseating granulomas in lung (usually a single granuloma), in mediastinal, tracheabronchial, and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, and palatine tonsils.17\n\n\u2022Tissue preservation\u25cbSamples for histopathology and immunohistochemistry are fixed in formalin. Small pieces, 1 cm thick, are ideal, with a 1:10 ratio of tissue to formalin. Large blocks of tissue autolyze during transport, because formalin does not penetrate to the center of the sample.\u25cbSamples for bacterial culture, virus isolation, and molecular testing are chilled with freezer packs or refrigerated. Frozen samples are also useful, especially when tissues are held pending the outcome of initial tests.\u25cbSwabs for bacterial culture or virus isolation are preserved in bacterial or viral transport medium, respectively, and chilled. The success of virus isolation is much reduced for swabs preserved in bacterial transport medium.\n\n",

            "text": "These results raise a consideration of the reasons for discrepant or unexpectedly negative test results. General considerations are outlined in Box 4\n. Histologic findings in this case of bronchointerstitial pneumonia fit well with the clinical picture of viral pneumonia and motivated further investigation of the cause. Subsequently, immunohistochemical testing for BVDV, BCV, and BPI3V was performed: BVDV infection does not cause primary lung disease but is an important predisposing cause of bacterial pneumonia and should be considered in any herd problem of respiratory disease, whereas BCV is an uncommon but underrecognized cause of viral pneumonia in cattle. These tests were negative, but a quantitative (\u201creal-time\u201d) reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for BRSV was performed subsequently and the results were positive.Box 4Interpretation of negative diagnostic laboratory dataWhen laboratory tests to detect an antigen, nucleic acid, culturable pathogen, or antibody unexpectedly fail, general considerations include the following:A.\nIncorrect clinical diagnosis: The suspected pathogen is not the cause, and alternative possibilities should be considered.B.\nDisease without active infection: The pathogen is the cause of the disease, but it is no longer present in the animal.\u2022BRSV and BPI3V are difficult to detect after 7\u20138 days postinfection, corresponding to a few days of clinical signs.18, 19, 20 In these cases, submitting samples from more acutely infected animals or measuring titers in acute and convalescent samples is a pathway to a definitive diagnosis.\u2022Bacteria may be eliminated or fail to grow in culture as a result of antibiotic treatment.\u2022\nDictyocaulus: During the acute phase of larval migration through the lung (7\u201325 days after infection), adults are not yet present in bronchi nor are there larvae in feces. Conversely, chronic or postpatent infections can still elicit clinical signs, despite the absence of adult worms in the lung or larvae in the feces. Finally, partially immune animals that are reinfected can develop severe disease, yet the infection never becomes patent. The results of the Baermann test on feces are negative in all 3 of these situations: acute prepatent, postpatent, and partially immune nonpatent infections.\nC.\nInadequate samples: The pathogen is the cause of the disease, but the samples are inadequate. See sampling strategies in Boxes 2 and 3.\u2022BRSV has a generalized distribution in the lung in some cases but is present only in the cranioventral lung in others.24, 25 Samples for virology testing should include 3 samples, including both the cranial and the caudal lung.\u2022Sampling from abscesses instead of actively infected tissue is likely to yield secondary pathogens.\u2022Sample autolysis as a result of inappropriate storage or transport of chilled specimens results in degradation of antigens and loss of viability of culturable pathogens. Immunohistochemical tests fail if tissues are autolyzed or underfixed, if the volume of formalin is too small, or if excessively large samples of tissue are used (1-cm-thick pieces are adequate for histopathologic examination).\u2022Freeze-thaw cycles are harmful, and they may occur from storage of samples in frost-free freezers or from thawing during transport.\u2022Prolonged fixation may interfere with antigen detection by immunohistochemistry: fixing for <1 week is generally recommended, although improved methods allow antigen retrieval with up to 7 weeks of fixation.26 Bouin solution or other alternatives to formalin fixation may affect immunohistochemical detection of some antigens,27, 28 but the addition of ethanol to prevent freezing (to a final concentration of 10%) is considered safe.\nD.\nTest failure: The pathogen is present in the sample but was not detected.\u2022Antibody interference: Antibody in the diagnostic specimen interferes with the ability of the test to detect the pathogen. The antibody may result from colostral transfer of maternal antibody, from vaccination, or from development of an immune response following infection. Such antibody may not protect against disease, yet may interfere with the ability of an immunoassay to detect viral antigen (eg, antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or inhibit growth of virus in tissue culture (virus isolation).\u2022\u201cInhibitors\u201d are substances in the sample that interfere with molecular detection of pathogens. This problem should be detected by routine quality control procedures in the laboratory.\u2022It is possible that genetic variants are not detected by routine diagnostic tests, particularly for RNA viruses. Although assays are tested during development against a broad collection of archived and contemporary isolates, it is possible that emerging strains of a pathogen are not detected by current tests.29\n\u2022Practitioners are dependent on a quality assurance program in the diagnostic laboratory, including test validation, appropriate use of positive and negative control samples, and valid interpretation of test data. Test results that conflict with clinical findings might represent laboratory error, and discussion with laboratory personnel can occasionally be fruitful in these circumstances.\n\n",

These contrasted with the negative results of the immunohistochemistry and fluorescent antibody tests and the absence of histologically evident syncytia. Reasons for the discrepancy in this case are speculative. The animal may have been subacutely infected, with little viral antigen remaining in the lung. Test sensitivity is a likely contributor: immunohistochemistry has the advantage that the best histologic lesions are selected for testing, and the test results are easily interpreted in conjunction with the histologic findings, yet prior studies have identified that quantitative RT-PCR testing for BRSV is more sensitive than other available tests.15, 24, 30 Further, because the 2 tests in this case were performed on different pieces of tissue, uneven distribution of antigen may have randomly resulted in one test being positive and the other negative. Laboratory quality control and overfixation of tissues were not thought to contribute to the negative tests in this case, based on appropriate results in control samples. The failure to detect bacterial pathogens despite histologic evidence of bronchopneumonia was presumed to have resulted from antibiotic treatment before death or perhaps from incorrect sample selection.",

Others have described a comparable outbreak of upper respiratory disease characterized by fever, nasal discharge with erosions, and submandibular swelling in vaccinated adult cows that was associated with seroconversion to this virus.33 The authors are not aware of any description of this condition in the peer-reviewed literature.2.None of the calves seroconverted to BPI3V, confirming the just-noted suspicion that the disease in the calves differed from that in the cows.3.There was a consistent trend of higher titers in young calves and lower titers in older calves, for all viruses tested except BRSV. This is interpreted to represent decay of maternal antibody as the calves age.4.Titers to BRSV were considerably higher in older than in younger calves, but none seroconverted. We would not rule out the possibility that this virus caused the disease in the calves, but this remains uncertain.\n",

One calf was obviously sick and later determined to have a fever. But another calf had been under observation by the producer since the previous day, with a subtle tendency to stay apart from its mates and away from the feed bunk. The authors decided, with considerable debate and uncertainty, that it was just homesick, and the decision was perhaps justified because it never did require antibiotic therapy.",

However, even well-trained and experienced producers, staff, or veterinarians are imperfect and uncertain when it comes to distinguishing calves with disease from those experiencing distress as a result of recent weaning, transportation, processing, and disruption of social groups. Further distinction between respiratory disease and diseases of other body systems and between antibiotic-responsive pneumonia and nonbacterial causes of respiratory disease are even more imprecise based on clinical features alone. In a study to assess diagnosis of BRD by feedlot personnel, the sensitivity of BRD diagnosis by pen checkers was 94% and specificity was 77%.34 Similarly, there was poor correlation between pulling a calf for suspected BRD and the presence of lung lesions at slaughter.35 Further, these challenges only cover the need to identify those calves with severe bacterial pneumonia that without treatment would die or progress to chronic disease: it is likely that early treatment of more mildly affected calves would have a beneficial effect on retreatment rates, feed efficiency, growth, and carcass quality, but our ability to accurately identify these calves is limited.36, 37, 38, 39 In this scenario, if experienced feedlot operators and veterinarians are imprecise in making these determinations, what can the laboratory diagnostician from Ontario contribute?",

Similarly, these parameters, when measured in acutely sick calves, were not useful predictors of the severity of lung lesions at necropsy.42, 43\n\u2022Arterial blood gas analysis and blood lactate levels do not reliably predict disease in challenged calves with mild lung lesions.42 However, in cattle with severe respiratory disease, a plasma lactate concentration of 4 mmol/L predicted death within 24 hours.44\n\u2022Serum haptoglobin concentrations in serum or plasma increase following experimental Mannheimia haemolytica challenge of BHV-1\u2013infected calves, and the degree of haptoglobin elevation correlated with disease severity, treatment failure, and greater likelihood of death.45, 46, 47 Compared with the rapid (24 hours) increase in serum haptoglobin within 24 hours of the induction of pneumonic pasteurellosis, the response to BRSV or BVDV infection is more delayed, occurring during a period of 4\u20138 days and corresponding with the onset of a febrile response to the viral infection.45, 48, 49, 50 The findings of these experimental studies extend to the naturally occurring disease, in which increased serum haptoglobin level has been correlated with the presence of fever and clinical diagnosis of BRD.46, 47, 51, 52\n\u2022Tests to measure other APPs, including lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and serum amyloid A, are not routinely available but may have advantages of earlier peak concentration.50, 53 In other studies, measuring fibrinogen, serum amyloid A, or \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, have not effectively distinguished between healthy cattle and those with respiratory disease under field conditions.46, 47, 51, 52\n\u2022Animals need to be sampled early in the course of disease, at the onset of clinical signs, for haptoglobin and other APPs to have good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting BRD are further improved by testing multiple APPs in parallel instead of using a single protein.47 A peril in using APPs to detect BRD is that an increase in APPs reflects inflammation that is not specific to the respiratory system. Haptoglobin values were elevated to a similar degree as with BRD-affected calves when measured in dairy calves affected by diarrhea, umbilical infections, and oral abscesses.51 Thus, a clinical assessment of the animal assists in the interpretation of elevated APP concentrations.\n",

            "text": "Fig.\u00a01: (A) Bronchopneumonia caused by M bovis. The cranioventral 40% of the lung is brick red and consolidated and contains innumerable pale, round approximately 3-mm-diameter nodules. Left lung: trachea is to the left. (B) M bovis bronchopneumonia. Section of lung with multiple coalescing nodules of caseous necrosis. (C) Generalized interstitial lung injury. The lung fails to collapse, is heavy as a result of edema, and has a generalized firm-rubbery texture. Interlobular septa contain innumerable tiny air bubbles (interlobular emphysema). A specific cause was not identified. Note the white opacity of the dorsocaudal pleura, which is normal in bovine lung. (D) Cranioventral bronchointerstitial pneumonia caused by BRSV. The cranioventral (lower right) 25% of the lung is collapsed and plum red and has a slightly firm-rubbery texture (but lacks the more obvious liver-like firmness that would be typical of bronchopneumonia). The dorsocaudal lung has a similar texture, with extensive interlobular emphysema. Right lung: trachea is to the right. (E) Embolic pneumonia. All lung lobes are peppered by 2- to 10-mm-diameter raised firm purple-red nodules (arrows), which had purulent exudate on cut section. The source of the infection was septic cellulitis and venous thrombosis, as a complication of a toggle surgery for displaced abomasum. Left lung: trachea is to the left. (F) Pulmonary embolism secondary to endocarditis. A ragged embolism fills the opened pulmonary artery. This lesion is easily overlooked if the arteries are not opened. Dorsal view of left lung: heart is to the left and caudal lung is to the right. (G) Fibrinous pleuritis caused by Histophilus somni. Yellow-white fibrin and fluid cover the pleural surface of the lung. The lung tissue is congested and edematous, but otherwise normal. Right lung: trachea is to the right. (H) Dictyocaulus viviparus. The caudal bronchi contain frothy fluid with a few adult nematodes. Dorsal view: trachea is to the left. Normal pink lobules contrasted with purple-red consolidated ones, in the adjacent lung tissue.",
