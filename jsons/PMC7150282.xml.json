This volume will be replaced within 24 hours in most healthy animals, although a return to normal levels of all blood constituents may take up to 2 weeks (Thrall et al., 2004). An alternate standard states that the blood volume withdrawn should not exceed 7.5% of the total blood volume per week or 10% of the total blood volume every 2 weeks (McGuill and Rowan, 1989).",

The increased turbidity associated with lipemia can produce artificially high values for certain enzymes. Lipemia also interferes with the assays for glucose, bilirubin, total protein, phosphorus, and urates (Saibaba et al., 1998). Hemolysis also produces errors in clinical biochemical values because most serum enzymes are present at high concentrations in red blood cells. Hemolysis causes the release of these enzymes into the bloodstream to yield artificially high serum values. Hemolysis may produce an artificial elevation of serum potassium and inorganic phosphorus levels (Owens et al., 2005, Stankovic and Smith, 2004), as well as bilirubin, transaminases, and lactate dehydrogenase (Gad, 2007).",

Differential LDH isozyme levels are used diagnostically (Markert et al., 1975). Isozyme LDH-1 (4H) has four heart subunits and is the major isozyme in heart. Isozyme LDH-2 (3H1M) has three heart and one muscle subunit and is the major isozyme in the macrophage-monocyte system and serum. The LDH-3 (2H2M) isozyme has two heart and two muscle subunits and is the major isozyme in lungs. Isozyme LDH-4 (1H3M) has one heart and three muscle subunits and is the primary isozyme in kidneys. The LDH-5 (4M) isozyme has four muscle subunits and is the major isozyme in liver and skeletal muscle. The concentration of LDH is elevated in serum as a result of organ infarction and significant cell death that results in loss of cytoplasm. For example, elevations of LDH result from conditions such as hepatitis, shock, hypoxia, extreme hypothermia, and meningitis, among others.

Acepromazine maleate (1\u20135 mg/kg IM) may be given to calm the rabbit and aid in vasodilation. Topical oil of wintergreen, xylene, and local anesthetics have all been used to aid in vasodilation (Hrapkiewicz and Medina, 2007). Xylene especially may be irritating if not thoroughly rinsed off the ear after blood withdrawal (Suckow and Douglas, 1997). The collection site should be shaved and then wiped with alcohol or an antiseptic solution. Blood is first collected from the vein near the base of the ear, with successive samples taken from the alternate ear or by moving distally toward the tip of the ear. A 25G or 26G needle or butterfly catheter may be inserted into the vein while pressure is applied to the vein at the base of the ear. It is difficult to obtain sufficient blood volume using this method in dwarf breed rabbits due to the small size of their ears (Melillo, 2007), and catheterization of this vein in dwarf breeds may lead to vascular necrosis, thrombosis, or sloughing of the ear (Vennen and Mitchell, 2009).",

Calcitrol is a metabolite of vitamin D and has a major effect on serum calcium levels in most animals by regulating calcium absorption from the gut. In contrast, gut absorption in the rabbit is independent of calcitrol, and serum calcium concentration depends directly on calcium levels in the diet (Brewer, 2006). Total serum calcium concentrations up to 15 mg/dl and higher have been reported in the rabbit (Hrapkiewicz et al., 2007, Melillo, 2007). Young rabbits and pregnant does have a higher calcium requirement than normal adult rabbits, resulting in lower blood calcium levels in these conditions (Melillo, 2007). Ionized calcium (Ca2+) concentration in rabbit serum is similar to that of other animals.",

The short neck of the guinea pig makes the jugular vein and cranial vena cava difficult to access, but shaving and proper positioning allow optimal exposure (Pilny, 2008). In the guinea pig, the right jugular vein is larger than the left and will yield up to 2.5 ml of blood. A 24G needle on a 1-ml syringe can be directed caudally to enter the jugular vein just cranial to the clavicle (Shomer et al., 1999). The cranial vena cava can be accessed with a 22G or 23G needle on a 3- or 6-ml syringe that is directed caudally into the sternal notch under the first rib. A ketamine\u2013xylazine mixture has been described as the preferable method of anesthesia for this route of blood sampling (Dang et al., 2008). However, the cranial position of the heart makes cardiac hemorrhage a significant risk when blood is sampled from the cranial vena cava (Joslin, 2009). The femoral vein can be used to collect up to 3 ml of blood with the guinea pig under anesthesia, in dorsal recumbency, and with the rear leg abducted. A 23G needle on a 1\u20133-ml syringe can be directed at a 45\u201390\u00b0 angle to the skin and inserted just ventral to the pulsing femoral artery within the femoral triangle (Joslin, 2009).",

Approximately 0.4 ml of blood is collected into a capillary tube after puncturing the interdigital vein with a 20G needle.

Anesthesia should be used in the gerbil for blood collection from sites other than the tail vein. The saphenous vein or metatarsal vein can be distended using a tourniquet proximal to the stifle and a small blood sample is collected into the hub of a 22G needle. A 0.1\u20130.3-ml blood sample can be collected from the retro-orbital venous sinus of a gerbil by advancing a microhematocrit tube through the lateral canthus and holding off the external jugular vein behind the mandible (Joslin, 2009). The medial canthus is also a viable approach to the retro-orbital sinus in the gerbil (Dyer and Cervasio, 2008). Alternatively, small volumes of blood may be obtained from the lateral metatarsal vein, or from a clipped toenail. Large volumes of blood can be obtained by cardiac puncture under anesthesia as a terminal procedure in the gerbil, as in other species (Hrapkiewicz and Medina, 2007).",

The Unopette system is a commercial kit that dilutes a blood sample 1:100 in acetic acid, resulting in membrane lysis and removal of erythrocytes and platelets. The remaining nucleated particles are leukocytes and these are quantified within a grid under a microscope. Electronic cell counters use a similar approach, except that red blood cells are lysed with a detergent solution before nucleated particles are quantified. A quantitative buffy coat analysis system (QBC, Becton Dickinson) expands the buffy coat layer in a specialized microhematocrit tube and quantifies the leukocytes by optical scanning. An automated hematology instrument uses lytic dilution of the blood sample to provide white blood cell numbers.",

For this reason, rabbit neutrophils are often referred to as pseudoeosinophils or, more commonly, heterophils. The neutrophil nucleus has a polymorphous shape and stains light purple to light blue. The neutrophil cytoplasm stains pink because of numerous small granules, with a reddish hue due to several larger dark-staining granules (Campbell and Ellis, 2007). By electron microscopy, these granules are identified as primary or azurophilic granules and secondary or specific granules, respectively (Jain, 1986). Primary and secondary granules are believed to arise from two different sites on the Golgi apparatus (Marshall, 2008). The small pink granules comprise 80\u201390% of the neutrophil granules and contain peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, and antibacterial activity (Benson and Paul-Murphy, 1999).",

These cells are common in pregnant guinea pigs and may be induced by estrogen to shift from the lungs and red pulp of spleen to the thymus and placenta (Moore, 2000).
