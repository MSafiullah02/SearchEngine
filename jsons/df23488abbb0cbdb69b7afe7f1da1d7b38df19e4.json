Brain infiltrating leukocytes were first phenotyped using markers indicative of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells. Results obtained during these studies showed a steady increase in the recruitment of B-lymphocyte-lineage cells into the brain throughout the timecourse of viral infection. Further, MCMV-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) were detected within the infiltrating leukocyte population using an ELISPOT assay. Immunohistochemical studies of brain sections revealed co-localization of CD138 + cells with either IgG or IgM. Additional immunohistochemical staining for MCMV early antigen 1 (E1, m112-113), a reported marker of viral latency in neurons, confirmed its expression in the brain during latent infection. Finally, using B-cell deficient (Jh 2/2 ) mice we demonstrated that B-lymphocytes control recovery of reactivated virus from latently-infected brain tissue. A significantly higher rate of reactivated virus was recovered from the brains of Jh 2/2 mice when compared to Wt animals.",

CMV is also the most frequent opportunistic cerebral infection in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, in whom it can cause encephalitis and encephalopathy. In immunocompetent patients, immune control mechanisms effectively prevent overt disease and terminate viral replication. However, ultimate clearance of the viral genome is not achieved. Instead, like other herpesviruses, CMV remains life-long at specific sites. During nonproductive, latent infection viral gene expression is minimized to a small subset of genes [1] . The productive viral replication cycle can be initiated from this latent infection and result in transient phases of virus shedding and recrudescent disease. In immunocompromised patients, recurrence of human CMV infection frequently leads to overt manifestations of disease [2] .",

The infection spreads into the parenchyma only in the absence of an effective CD8 response [5] . Evidence suggests that neural stem cells which escape the lytic phase of infection may differentiate into neurons that express a latency-associated antigen MCMV E1 (m112-113) [6] . These studies utilized neonatal mice to show preferential expression of E1 in latently-infected neurons.

Neuroborreliosis, neurosyphilis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and multiple sclerosis are all characterized by CNS accumulation of Blymphocyte lineage cells such as antibody secreting cells (ASC) and elevated immunoglobulin in cerebral spinal fluid [16, 17] . During experimental CNS infections by RNA viruses such as Sindbis, Semliki Forest, rabies, and neurotropic coronaviruses, ASC appear to play a local protective role [18, 19, 20, 21] . Despite several reports describing the vital role that antibodies play during MCMV infection in peripheral organs, it remains to be determined whether a microenvironment which fosters humoral immune responses in the brain is created following MCMV infection and whether this response plays a significant role in controlling viral infection. In the present study, we investigated the kinetics of B-lymphocyte lineage cell recruitment into the brain, their ability to produce virus-specific antibodies, and their role in controlling viral infection.",

In this study, multi-color flow cytometry was used to phenotype lymphocyte subpopulations infiltrating the brain at various time points p.i. Brain-infiltrating mononuclear cells were isolated on a percoll gradient as described in the methods. These isolated cells were subsequently immunostained using the markers CD45, CD11b, CD3 and CD19. B-cells expressing the CD19 marker were identified among the CD45 (hi) CD11b + population, which represent cells of myeloid origin. At 7 d p.i., 2.85% of the cells were reactive to CD19 and this population increased to 3.93%, 5.04%, and 8.99% at 14, 21 and 35 d p.i., respectively (Fig. 1A) .

Previous studies using an Ig m chain-deficient mouse, devoid of B-cells and antibodies, revealed that antibodies are not required for the resolution of primary MCMV infection, and latency is established with the same kinetics as in seropositive controls [27, 28] . Using this model, studies have shown that virus could be reactivated in various organs including, salivary glands, lungs and spleen [29] . These findings suggested that B-cells, along with other immune cells, play a vital role in preventing the recovery of reactivated virus from different organs. However, the role of these cells in the brain was not addressed. Using a similar mouse strain, Jh 2/2 , which fails to produce functional B-cells as they lack the gene for the heavy chain joining region, we investigated the effect of B-lineage cells on recovery of virus reactivated from latently infected brain tissue. Latently infected brain tissue samples were collected from Wt and Jh 2/2 and were processed as outlined in the Fig. 5A . Slow-dividing, primary murine glial cells were used as indicator cells for explant cultures. In addition, direct homogenized tissue samples collected at 30 d p.i. were tested negative for MCMV-IE1 genes in Wt and Jh 2/2 mice by real-time PCR assay, indicating an absence of productive viral infection. 7-10 d postexplant, murine mixed glial cultures were either stained for the presence of MCMV-IE1 protein by immunohistochemistry or prepared for real-time PCR. In these experiments, recovery of reactivated virus was found to be significantly higher in the Jh 2/2 ",

IL-21 is a type I cytokine that signals through a receptor composed of IL-21R and the common cytokine receptor c-chain [30] . Over the past decade, IL-21 has emerged as a key cytokine for the differentiation of activated B lymphocytes into plasma cells and, in consequence, for establishing and maintaining Ab responses. IL-21 is produced mainly by distinct T lymphocyte subsets. It has been established in studies using human cells that mature plasma cells do not express IL-21 receptors, hence do not require IL-21 [22] . In our study, decreased levels of IL-21 in the brain were observed at 30 d.p.i., when a higher number of ASCs was detected.

Depending on the host and viral system, the question of whether the virus is truly latent or maintains a low-level, persistent viral infection has not been completely resolved. Operationally, latency is defined as the inability to detect replicating virus despite the presence of virus DNA and perhaps some limited transcription. In murine models of MCMV infection, latency is characterized by the ability to reactivate virus from cells of infected tissues after cocultivation with permissive cells in culture, even though infectious virus cannot be detected directly in tissue homogenates [36, 37] . Immunosuppression [38] or immunologic modulation, such as allogeneic stimulation [39] , has been shown to induce reactivation of latent virus. Results of the studies reported here support the idea that after MCMV brain infection, virus becomes latent in neurons and that this latent virus may subsequently reactivate. In addition to the brain, results from several studies suggest that MCMV also becomes latent in other organs, including eye [38] , lungs [40] and salivary glands [41] . Earlier studies have also demonstrated that virus recovery from other latently infected tissues, such as salivary gland and lungs, is 100-1000 fold higher in B-cell deficient mice [29] .",

These studies utilized neonatal infection models to demonstrate differential expression of various gene products in diverse cellular sources. In this study, utilizing the same monoclonal antibody, we confirmed that E1 expression was evident in the hippocampal region and, based upon the morphology of infected cells, it appears that neurons were the cell type harboring latent viral infection. Interestingly, we failed to detect mRNA for the E1 gene directly from brain homogenate at 30 d p.i., possibly due to low copy numbers and detection limits in the homogenates.",

Mononuclear cells were isolated from the brains of MCMVinfected mice as described above, added to wells (2610 5 cells/well) in triplicate, and incubated overnight. ASC spots were developed by sequential addition of biotinylated anti-IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated strepavidin (Vector Laboratories), and 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole substrate (BD Biosciences) and counted using a dissecting microscope. The numbers of specific ASC were determined by subtraction of the average number of spots in the irrelevant antigen wells (range: 0-5) from the average number of spots in the MCMV-specific antigen wells.",

The coronal sections were then cut around the ventricles; ,25 pieces were collected from each brain that represented tissue adjoining lateral and central ventricles. 3-4 pieces were then inoculated onto previously prepared primary mouse brain cultures in a 12-well plate. The cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The cultures were analyzed microscopically for the occurrence of cytopathic effect. Half of the wells containing primary mouse brain culture cells infected with the recovered viruses were analyzed by immunostaining using monoclonal antibodies Croma101 (anti-MCMV IE1) and a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Hamburg, Germany). The remaining wells were used for RNA isolation and real-time PCR detection of MCMV-IE1 and gB gene expression.",
