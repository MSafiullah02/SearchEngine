Communications therefore form an integral part of any surveillance system.\nAppropriate in terms of the resources available\nDo not try to overreach when setting up a system. For example, expatriate staff may best be used to recruit local staff for the system and in supervisory activities rather than in collecting data.\nSustainable in the long term within local resources\nThis criterion is certainly a goal to aim for as sustainability must be the target for all aid work. However, there may be situations where an emergency system is needed rapidly and where it cannot readily be integrated into existing systems or be developed as a new long-term system.\nBased on standardized sampling methods\nThe sampling system must use the same data collection methods throughout if data are to be comparable. Ideally this should be methods that are internationally agreed and approved. Agreement should be sought for the methods from the other agencies on the ground to ensure consistency.\nBased on agreed case definitions\nWithout case definitions that are agreed by all parties the likelihood of success of a surveillance system is very low. This is especially so when laboratory support is minimal or absent since clinical case definitions have to be drawn very tightly if different diseases are not to be confused.\nCapable of providing regular information from defined sites\nRoutine surveillance requires more than material from ad hoc sources. Sites such as medical centers (in towns, villages, or refugee camps), hospitals, and/or public health units should be recruited.\nCapable of covering the whole affected area\nThe more comprehensive the coverage of the system, the more likely is it that the data will be accurate and complete and that problems will not be missed. Such coverage can be problematic. The coverage of the different systems that can be used is discussed below.\nCompatible with existing systems\nThe data collected and the methods used should ideally fit in with systems that are operating or have previously operated in the area.\nUse existing systems as far as possible\nFollowing from Criterion 10, if systems are already in existence or in abeyance but revivable then this should be done so as to ensure compliance by local health-care services and continuity of data collection and analysis.\nUse existing records as far as possible\nExisting records are of considerable value for predictive purposes. Knowledge of past problems makes it possible to anticipate future trends and problems and allows for early planning decisions.\nInvolve collaboration between agencies so as to avoid duplication\nIf several health agencies are operating it is essential to ensure collaboration among them in surveillance activities to avoid confusion and duplication of effort.\nInvolve collaboration with local services so as to avoid duplication\nAs above, early involvement of local health and surveillance services will reduce workloads and avoid duplication of effort.\nAcceptable to those surveyed\nIf those from whom the data are collected, those who are collecting the data, and those who will receive the results are unhappy with the system, the system is unlikely to operate effectively.\n",

CMR is usually expressed as number of deaths per 10,000 persons per day. If the CMR rises above 1/10,000 per day (>2/10,000 per day for young children) an acute emergency is developing and the emergency phase lasts until the daily CMR falls to 1/10,000 per day or below.\nAge-specific mortality rate (number of deaths in individuals of a specific age due to a specific cause/defined number of individuals of that age/day). In children this is usually given as the number of deaths in children younger and older than 5 years/1,000 children of each age/day). NB: If population data for the under 5s are not available, an estimate of 17% of the total population may be used.\nMaternal mortality rate. Maternal mortality is a sensitive indicator of the effectiveness of health-care systems. A maternal death is usually defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the termination of the pregnancy (for whatever cause) from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management. The 42-day cut-off is recommended by WHO but some authorities use a time of up to a year.Maternal mortality rate = (number of deaths from puerperal causes in a specified area in a year/number of live births in the area during the same year) \u00d7 1,000 (or \u00d7100,000)\nCause-specific death rates (case fatality rates \u2013 usually given as a percentage).

Some vaccines (BCG, measles, MR, MMR, and rubella vaccines) are also sensitive to strong light and must always be protected against sunlight or fluorescent (neon) light. These vaccines are usually supplied in dark brown glass vials, which give them some protection against light damage, but they must still be covered and protected from strong light at all times. Only vaccine stocks that are fit for use should be kept in the vaccine cold chain. Expired or heat-damaged vials should be removed from cold storage.
