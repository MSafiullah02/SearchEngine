Infection with influenza B is considered by experts as milder than infection with influenza A serotypes [4]. In previous cohort studies, infection with influenza A was documented to result in higher rates of hospitalization and mortality than infection with influenza B [5, 6]. However, among predominantly ambulatory adults with seasonal influenza, clinical features of influenza A and influenza B were similar [7]. Evidence of clinical differences between influenza A and influenza B is sparse, as there have been only a few studies describing the clinical characteristics of influenza B infection or comparing the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or influenza B. The aim of this study was to challenge the notion of milder infection with influenza B by comparing the characteristics and clinical outcomes of hospitalized adult patients with confirmed influenza A and influenza B at the 2017\u20132018 season.",

The detection method used was Simplexa\u2122 Flu A/B & RSV (https://www.focusdx.com/product/MOL2600). The test is a real-time RT-PCR amplification and detection system that utilizes a bi-functional fluorescent probe primer for the detection and differentiation of human influenza A virus RNA, human influenza B virus RNA, and RSV RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs. The assay is composed of two principal steps: (1) extraction of RNA from patient specimens; (2) a bi-functional fluorescent probe primer is used together with a reverse primer to amplify a specific target (for each analyte and the RNA internal control). The assay provides three results; conserved regions of influenza A viruses (matrix gene), influenza B viruses (matrix gene), and RSV (M gene) are targeted to identify these viruses in the specimen. An RNA internal control is used to monitor the extraction process and to detect RT-PCR inhibition.",

To identify individual variables associated with the composite primary outcome and 30-day all-cause mortality, univariate analysis was performed. Normality distribution was assessed through Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test and Q-Q plots test. Categorical variables were tested using the chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. Continuous variables were examined using the Student\u2019s t test if normally distributed and Mann-Whitney U test if not normally distributed. Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was used for goodness of fit. In order to identify independent risk factors for influenza-related adverse events and mortality, variables that were significantly associated with influenza-related adverse events and mortality in the univariate analysis, and not highly correlated, were entered into the multivariate logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for influenza-related adverse events and 30-day mortality were calculated.",

Overall, the rate of influenza-related adverse events was 12.3% which was composed mainly from pneumonia and/or 30-day all-cause mortality. Our results suggest that patients hospitalized due to influenza A or influenza B infection are similar in regard to the hosts medical and social background, clinical course, and outcomes, apart from the increased rate of lower respiratory tract infection with influenza A. However, infection with influenza B is as severe as infection with influenza A with increased morbidity and mortality, especially for patients prone to suffer from influenza-related adverse events due to their medical conditions. This finding might correlate with mismatch vaccine year of the influenza B lineage as shown previously [8]. This could also explain why influenza B has represented more than two-thirds of the cases in our cohort, inversely related to their endemic attack rate. Indeed, in Israel, influenza A H3N2 was the predominant species circulating in the community on the 2017\u20132018 influenza season (76.5%), while influenza B cases were less than 2% [9].",

However, the sparse data on the clinical features of the influenza virus types in hospitalized adults do not consistently support that notion. Several retrospective cohort studies suggested that infection with influenza A may result in higher rates of hospitalization and mortality than infection with influenza B [5, 6]. However, other previous studies suggested a similar course. Among patients with influenza who were admitted to medical ICU, influenza A was associated with increased rate of viral pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but mortality, LOS at ICU admission, and other clinical outcomes did not differ between influenza A\u2013 and influenza B\u2013infected patients [8], similarly to our study. Among ambulatory adults with seasonal influenza, clinical features and outcomes (hospitalization, antibiotic prescription, pneumonia) of influenza A (H3N2 strain) and influenza B were similar in a prospective study [7]; however, patients with influenza A sought medical attention earlier. Further data from studies on pediatric patients with influenza demonstrated mixed results. Children with influenza B had increased mortality rates and ICU admission [10]. Study on mixed ambulatory population in Canada [11] suggested that patients infected with influenza A had increased rate of chronic pulmonary conditions, and other comorbidities, while patients infected with influenza B were significantly younger (median age 13, range 3\u201343, vs. 42, range 2\u201383) and more likely to reside at rural areas. The largest study by Cahves et al. [12] which examined the clinical features of patients with influenza A serotypes (H3N2 and H1N1(pdm09)) and influenza B demonstrated an increase in severe outcomes (ICU admission and/or mortality) with influenza A H1N1(pdm09) compared with H3N2 and influenza B. Patients with influenza A H1N1(pdm09) were more likely to suffer from pneumonia and ARDS and require mechanical ventilation similar to our results.",

First, this is a single-center experience over a single influenza season; thus, results may not be applicable to other areas at different seasons with different circulating influenza strains. Second, we did not perform further analysis of the influenza serotype. In 2017\u20132018, influenza A H1N1(pdm09) and H3N2 strains, along with influenza B of the Victoria lineage (closely to 16%, 14%, and 70% of all confirmed infections, respectively), were the most common strains circulating in the community [9]. A strain-based analysis might add more information on the specific presentation of each strain. Third, data on the current influenza vaccine were unavailable for significant percentage of the patients because of technical difficulties in retrieving data. Rather, medical histories including vaccination history that was documented on medical records were the only data source for vaccination status. Thus, the true effect of the vaccine on the clinical outcomes was therefore inestimable.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining the course of the different influenza strains in hospitalized adults since the 2010\u20132011 seasons which contained a switch from mainly H3 strain to H1 strains. Most previous studies had examined the general ambulatory population with uncomplicated influenza, while we focused on hospitalized patients with significant comorbidities and thus high rate of influenza-related adverse events. As the majority of adults with seasonal influenza have good prognosis without complications, and vice versa, most adults who were admitted to ICU due to influenza suffer grave consequences; the clinical course of influenza on the hospital ward is largely unexplored.",
