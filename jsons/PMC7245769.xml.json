Timely and effective intervention can improve the success rate of treatment of critically ill patients [3]. We believe imaging examination is the main method for clinicians to understand the progress of the disease. Previous studies have indicated that the chest CT examination plays a important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios [4]. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes [5]. In this study, we have explored the application of low-dose chest CT scans in the follow-up of patients with COVID-19 using Care Dose 4D combined with Karl\u2019s 3D iterative reconstruction technology compared with conventional-dose chest CT.",

For CT inspection, the patient was in a supine position, with both hands raised above the head. The scans were performed from the apex of both lungs to the diaphragm on both sides when the breath of the patients was hold at the end of deep inhale. CareDose 4D technique and filtered back projection(FBP) algorithm image reconstruction were used in both groups. The fixed tube current of the two groups was 120 kV. The reference tube currents of the study group and the control group were 30mAs and 130mAs, respectively. The scan matrix was 512 \u00d7 512, with 5 mm of layer thickness, 5 mm of layer spacing and 1.0725 of pitch. The image reconstruction layer thickness was 1 mm and the layer spacing was 0.8 mm. The lung window of the control group was reconstructed with routine reconstruction method, while the study group was reconstructed using Karl 3D level 3 iterative technology. The KARL Iterative Reconstruction technique is designed to perform both in the projection (raw data) space and the image space for uCT family systems. Starting in projection space, KARL detects signals that are likely to contribute to image artifacts. Once the signals are selected, their noise level will be estimated based on photon statistics. Then the projection data will be iteratively processed by penalizing the selected noise data according to the noise model, and artifacts would be significantly suppressed while edge information is still preserved.",

            "text": "How to reduce the radiation dose under the premise of meeting the needs of the imaging diagnosis has been studied intensively in recent years. Among them, reducing the tube current is one of the main methods to reduce the radiation dose. Studies show that lowering the tube current can effectively reduce the CT radiation dose [8]. Chinese Medical Association experts have recommended 100 ~ 120KV and less than 30mAs as a new generation iterative algorithm of low-dose screening scheme CT [9]. Hu et al. have screened ground glass nodules in the lungs using the reference tube current of 30 mAs. They used CareDose 4D technology to automatically adjust the tube current according to the change of the thickness of the human body to obtain similar image quality for each layer [10]. Although low-dose scanning has been studied intensively, no personalized scanning method specifically for GGO and crazy-paving pattern has been reported. In this study, we have applied a CareDose 4D scanning method combined Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology with a fixed 120 kV and reference tube current of 30mAs for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients. We have used Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology in the study group, but not in the control group. If the control group of the lung window use karl 3D iterative reconstruction, the images will be too smooth, and the contrast will be reduced. Karl 3D is an iterative reconstruction technology of United Imaging Healthcare (UIH), which found that image quality is limited by conventional filtered back projection (FBP) imaging reconstruction technique. By FBP, noise in reconstruction images obviously increases as radiation dose decreases, which impacts diagnostic confidence. In order to effectively reduce radiation dose while ensuring the accuracy of diagnosis, Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology has been developed by UIH, which can greatly reduce the image noise caused by low-dose scanning and effectively improve the image quality [11]. We found that there was no statistically significant difference in the objective scores of overall image quality between the study group and control group. However, significant differences were found in CTDIvol, DLP and ED radiation dose indexes between the two groups. The effective dose in the study group (1.22 \u00b1 0.14 mSv),which was reduced by about 76%, was much lower than that of the control group (5.05 \u00b1 0.74 mSv).",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that the CT image results showed that small patchy GGOs are usually found to be localized at the pleura, unilateral or lower lung lobe at early stage of COVID-19 [12]. As the disease progresses, GGO will increase and some consolidations and grid-like changes may also occur. Two weeks later, the lesions are gradually absorbed. The density, scope and number of lesions is reduced. Only a little thin GGO and fiber strand shadows remain. During the early GGO progress, the density increases and the interlobular septal thickening forms a grid-like shadow, which is the crazy-paving pattern [13, 14]. We used GGO and crazy-paving pattern as the image evaluation criteria for two main reasons. One is that these two signs are important CT signs of COVID-19, and the occurrence rate is high. The second is that the GGO contrast is low and close to normal lung tissue. It is difficult to observe the lesion clearly when the image noise is increased [15]. The main CT signs of COVID-19 include GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and fiber strands, etc. But axial interstitial thickening is rare. It may be related to the fact that the lesion is easy to involve the peripulmonary interstitium and less axial interstitial tissue. We found that the incidence of the above signs was similar and there was no statistical difference between the two groups. In our study, the subjective scores of the image quality of the two groups were \u2265 3, with no statistical difference. Also, there was no significant difference in the SD value between the two groups. Although the image quality of the study group was slightly lower than that of the control group, it meets the imaging diagnostic requirements. The high incidence of multiple signs in this study indicates that the disease progresses rapidly, and signs often coexist in multiple periods.",

Follow-up with low-dose CT (Fig. A) showed that the lower lobe of the lungs is scattered with thin GGO and the edges are blurred. Tube voltage is 12 0 kV and tube current is 29 mA. After 5 days, follow-up with conventional dose CT (Fig. B), showed slightly absorbed sub-pleural GGO compared to Fig. A. Tube voltage is 120 kV and tube current is 20 mA. (C-D) CT images of a 81-year old female. Follow-up with conventional dose CT (tube voltage of 120KV and tube current of 131 mA) curved grid-like shadows can be seen under the pleura of both lungs, showing crazy-paving pattern (Fig. C), followed by low-dose CT (tube voltage of 20 kV and tube current of 31 mA) follow-up 2 weeks (Fig. D), The symptoms are not obvious, and the arc GGO changes. (E) CT image of a 64-year old male. Low-dose CT follow-up of clearly showed that the lower lobe subpleural crazy-paving pattern and the right lower lung was partially consolidated. (F) CT image of a 38-year old female. Tube voltage 120 kV, tube current 43mAs. Follow-up with low-dose CT showed flaky consolidation in lower lobe of right lung.
