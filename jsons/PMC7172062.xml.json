Following fusion of mouse spleen cell suspensions with Sp2/0Ag14 myeloma cells, hybridomas were tested for specific reactivity with hMPV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay. Following cloning and subcloning, MAbs previously selected for specific reactivity with hMPV were tested for type specificity by IFA using our type A and B prototype strains. Specific reactivity with viral proteins was tested by Skiadopoulos at NIH, NIAID (Bethesda, MD) by Western blot of sucrose-purified reference hMPV strains CAN83 (type A) and CAN75 (type B) which were isolated in Canada and represent known prototypes of each of the two major genetic lineages (Peret et al., 2002). In addition, MAbs were tested by IFA on LLC-MK2 cells, which were infected with recombinant human parainfluenza virus type 1 expressing the hMPV fusion (F), small hydrophobic (SH), and the attachment glycoprotein (G) of both Canadian prototypes (Newman et al., 2002, Skiadopoulos et al., 2004).",
