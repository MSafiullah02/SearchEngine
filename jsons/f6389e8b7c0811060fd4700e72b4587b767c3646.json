Subsequently, a surge of cases was observed in the state mainly through the individuals who traveled from Europe and the Middle East to Kerala, thus initiating an outbreak. Since public awareness through dissemination of reliable information plays a significant role in controlling the spread of the disease, the Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins. However, this unstructured data requires refinement and enrichment for upstream applications, such as visualization, and/or analysis. Here we reported a citizen science initiative that leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins, supplemented with the information from media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This data was further used to provide real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for non-specialists. We ensured longevity and reusability of the dataset by depositing it in a public repository, aligning with open source principles for future analytical efforts. Finally, to show the scope of the sourced data, we also provided a snapshot of outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 99 days of the outbreak.",

Initial studies revealed the clinical and prognostic features of COVID-19 along with its transmission dynamics, and stressed the need for implementing public health measures for containment of infection and transmission among the population at high-risk 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In response to this, several countries have implemented measures including travel restrictions and physical distancing by community-wide quarantine 2, 5, 9 . These extensive measures were imposed, taking into consideration the lack of adequate testing kits for detection, a vaccine, or proven antivirals for preventing or treating this disease along with reports of considerable strain on the health system leading to unprecedented loss of human life.",

We also visualized the trend of COVID-19 spread for Kerala, along with the district-wise details for the number of daily cases for confirmed, active, recovered, and deceased. The daily addition of new case reports, along with the cumulative numbers of RT-PCR tests performed, was also displayed in the dashboard (Figure 3A, B, and Supplementary Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, our dashboard was the first one to be online (March 22, 2020) with a bilingual dashboard (with English and the local language Malayalam), featuring outbreak map, hotspot map, and trend line map with reports of new, active, and recovered cases, along with COVID-19 related deaths in Kerala. The official dashboard version by DHS followed later. We regularly received feedback from the users and added new plots and visual tools based on user recommendations. During the first forty-five days, the web application has seen 28,653 unique users, and the site has an average of 2000 visitors per day.

The median age of affected individuals was 35 (0-93) (male; 36.5 (2-93), female; 33(0-88)). Around 64.5% of cases had a travel history to places with reported infection, and 35.5% infected by secondary transmission. Kasaragod, followed by Kannur, two northern districts in Kerala, reported the highest number of cases, which contributed to 59% of the state's cases. However, even as the number of reports during this time frame increased, there was no official report of community spread. During the reported period, the state declared 102 hotspots for infection, and currently (May 7, 2020), this number was reduced to 33 as the number of active cases were less. Kerala established 21 testing centers across (15 government and 6 private) the states and performed 38206 tests during the period January 31, 2020, to May 07, 2020, which accounted for 1098 tests per million of the population (TPR = 1.64%). In addition to routine testing, the DHS implemented additional targeted testing and testing based on random sampling in the hotspot areas. The median duration of illness was 14 (4-45) days, with a trend that showed increasing recovery time for the older age group. Oldest individuals to recover were 93 and 88 years old.",

Data from Kerala also provides insights about the mean duration of illness and the effect of increasing age on this parameter.Although Kerala reported the first case of COVID-19 and was once contributing to the most significant proportion of individuals for the infection in India, the practical strategy by the government, coupled with the co-operative citizens, resulted in the first trend of curve flattening. Effectively controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala and restricting the death rate, even among high-risk age groups without an effective vaccine or antiviral medication is commendable, when compared to the high mortality observed in other states of India and several developed countries. This achievement can be attributed to several factors. Kerala is known for its highest human development index in India33,34 and was the first state in the country to implement widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2, along with meticulous contact tracing, and individual and community-level quarantine measures. High literacy and digital-literacy rates also helped to organize and disseminate information in real-time35 .
