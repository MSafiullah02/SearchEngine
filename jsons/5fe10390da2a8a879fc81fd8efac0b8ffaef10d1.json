COVID-19erelated mortality risk factors include advanced age, male sex, and certain comorbidities, including immunosuppression. 1 Besides direct viral-induced injury, the host cytokine-mediated antiviral response potentiates tissue damage. 1 Pemphigus, a mucocutaneous autoimmune blistering disease, increases infection risk via multiple mechanisms, including epithelial barrier breakdown and therapy-related immunosuppression. Given the need to balance appropriate pemphigus treatment with reduction of COVID-19eassociated mortality risk, we have outlined treatment considerations for this particularly vulnerable patient population below.",

Reconstitution of B-cell immunity can take months, which could be problematic for patients who contract COVID-19. In addition, logistics of intravenous infusions may not be feasible when limits on nonemergent medical care are mandated. We have taken the approach of postponing rituximab infusions temporarily, with the aim of delaying peak patient immunosuppression during peak COVID-19 incidence to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes.",

However, their nonspecific immunosuppressive effects increase infection risk, among other complications, in a dose-dependent manner. A basic therapeutic principle with particular importance during the pandemic is that glucocorticoids and steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, should be tapered to the lowest effective dose. In active COVID-19 infection, immunosuppressive steroid-sparing medications should be discontinued when possible, although glucocorticoid cessation often cannot be considered due to risk for adrenal insufficiency.",
