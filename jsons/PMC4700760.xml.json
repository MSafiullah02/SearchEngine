Clinically, influenza is usually a self-limiting disease but may cause uncommon but fatal complications, including rapidly progressive pneumonia, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1, 2] and sometimes, lethal cardiac complications such as acute myocarditis and even cardiogenic shock [3\u20136]. Because influenza A is so important and has caused many endemic outbreaks, the significance of influenza B may have been underestimated [1]. Herein, we present a very rare case who is a previously healthy adult patient with influenza B and rapidly experienced both ARDS and acute myocarditis.",

He was treated with oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days from day 4 even though the rapid influenza test was negative. Finally, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from endotracheal aspirates showed positive results for influenza B based on the report of Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan.",

His conditions gradually improved and the endotracheal tube was successfully removed on day 22 (Fig. 1d), after which he returned to an ordinary ward. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal enhancement of left ventricular wall, especially at anterior-inferior wall of the left ventricle (Fig. 3), consistent with acute myocarditis.
