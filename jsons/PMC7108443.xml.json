Many viruses are involved in respiratory infection and include: influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1\u20134, adenoviruses (ADV), human rhinoviruses (hRV), human coronaviruses (hCoV: OC43, 229E, NL-63, NL-Hong Kong and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)) and human metapneumoviruses (hMPV). Many of the infections are indistinguishable by clinical features alone and require rapid laboratory investigation for optimal patient management and infection control. Detection of respiratory viruses is becoming clinically important as the possibilities for antiviral treatment increase. Some of the viruses (hRVs and hCoVs) were initially considered as causing mild infections but are now more frequently found to be associated with severe infections (Ison et al., 2003, van Elden et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Viral culture is the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses. However, some viruses grow poorly in cell culture, and therefore routine diagnosis is sub-optimal as, for example, with hMPV (van den Hoogen et al., 2004). Furthermore, culture is relatively slow which affects the clinical value, and therefore alternatives are employed. Rapid antigen detection tests are available for influenza viruses A and B, PIV 1\u20133 and RSV and adenoviruses, which are widely used in routine laboratories. These have been shown to be less sensitive and less specific than culture, particularly in adult or elderly populations (Casiano-Colon et al., 2003, Effler et al., 2002, Storch, 2003). Amplification assays are now increasingly being used in the clinical laboratory and have proven to be more sensitive and specific than culture (Syrmis et al., 2004, van Elden et al., 2002, Weinberg et al., 2002, Weinberg et al., 2004). Newer real-time PCR formats also enable rapid test results (Templeton et al., 2004) while some conventional formats can detect a large number of respiratory viruses in a single test (Puppe et al., 2004, Coiras et al., 2004, Gruteke et al., 2004) PCR is often the most appropriate means to diagnose slow growing viruses (van Elden et al., 2004; van den Hoogen et al., 2004) due to the difficulties sometimes observed with culture.",

The panels were assessed as a small-scale dilution series prior to distribution in a second laboratory to determine the detection limit after a freeze-thaw step. Thereafter, the same stock viruses were used to prepare the final panels. These samples were not assessed by more than one reference centre prior to distribution so there have been some differences between the initial small-scale dilution series and the bulk panels sent to all participants. The lowest positive dilution used for OC43 was detected by none of the participants, so this dilution was too low for inclusion in further panels. However, for many of the panels, a number of the NATs used have detected all dilutions of the viruses in the panels, showing that the panels employed gave a good indication of NAT performance. In the future, the panel could be produced by freeze-drying the samples and include more pre-distribution testing to ensure more reproducible panels, as employed in other QCMD schemes (Schirm et al., 2002, Schloss et al., 2003).",

The false negative results observed were either results of samples below the detection limit of the assays, or of primer and probes not detecting the viruses at all. The selection of primers and probes for respiratory viruses is essential as a single NAT is employed for a specific virus that needs to detect many variants. Adenoviruses comprise of six different serotypes that show large sequence variation and RNA viruses show even greater sequence variation, as they lack proof reading capability. The virus included in the hMPV panel was a very well characterised (van den Hoogen et al., 2001), and therefore this information would have been used to generate NATs whereas the PIVs were clinical isolates with no publicly available sequence information. This knowledge of sequence information would affect the design of the NATs, and hence one of the reasons why the hMPV panel had good performance scores and the PIV poor.",

This is a result of poor primer and probe design to a non-conserved region of the virus. Most of the panels only contained one virus type; however, the panel for hRV contained three subtypes and the panel for ADV contained two subtypes. These two panels showed that some assays were unable to detect certain subtypes, even in the high positive sample, but were able to detect the weak positive with other subtypes. This is a result of primer and/or probe selection, which were unable to detect these viruses owing to the sequence variation seen in these strains. Therefore, participants who missed these strains would need to adapt their NAT in order to detect the possible variations. These results indicate the problem of using NAT methods for detection of respiratory viruses, in that they are not catch-all methods and careful evaluation of the primers and probes needs to be performed to ensure that no false negatives are obtained. All respiratory viruses detected in clinical samples will have sequence variation. So, in future panels more viruses to determine the ability of assays to detect clinical isolates might be included. In the case of influenza A and B, the strains included could be the most common circulating strains from the previous winter. In this way, the quality of the NATs can be monitored for detection of a wide variety of viral strains.",

There are a lot of factors that affect NAT sensitivity but this study gives some indications as to ways to improve sensitivity with PCR format, selection of gene target for the PCR and design of primers and probe. Firstly, all the individual components of the 83 in-house NAT could achieve maximal sensitivity in one or more panels, so the difference in sensitivity is probably due to inter-laboratory variation. Another factor that affects sensitivity is the methodology. However, all methodologies, except the one laboratory using the RV\u00aeChip assay, could obtain maximum scores. So, again, the differences are probably due to inter-laboratory variations. A wide range in performance could be seen with the same methodology, e.g. real-time PCR.",
