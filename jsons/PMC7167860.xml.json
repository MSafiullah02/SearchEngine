            "text": "Coronaviruses have relatively high mutation and RNA recombination rates and rapidly undergo cross\u2010species transmission events in vitro and in vivo.1, 2, 3 In humans, viruses newly emerging out of members of Coronaviridae cause serious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)4 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).5 Interest in the pathogenicity of murine coronaviruses, particularly, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), has grown because of the high incidences of mutation rates with consequences of different pathogeneses6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as well as their ability, especially in JHM strains of MHV (JHMV), to cause both acute and chronic CNS diseases ,10, 11 because neuropathogenic viruses can induce significant neuronal dysfunction and degeneration of specific neuronal populations, sometimes leading to devastating, life\u2010threatening consequences in infected humans.12, 13 Among JHMVs, cl\u20102 exhibits extremely high neurovirulence.10, 14, 15 A less virulent viral clone, srr7, has been isolated from cl\u20102, as a soluble receptor\u2010resistant mutant.15, 16 All mice infected with cl\u20102 die within 3 days post\u2010inoculation (dpi), whereas mice infected with srr7 exhibit no clinical sign before 5 dpi and some of them survive after 10 dpi. However, there is no difference in the viral growth rate during the initial phase of infection between these two strains.15, 17, 18, 19 The different virulence of these viruses is attributed to their capability to infect neurons,15, 20 or their infectivity being independent or dependent upon a major MHV\u2010receptor, carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 1.21, 22 In agreement with their similar viral proliferation rates during the early phase of infection, the two viruses exhibit almost the same patterns of viral spread in the brain during the initial phase of infection. The viral antigens are first detected in the infiltrating cells, namely CD11b\u2010positive (CD11b+) cells of monocyte lineage, in the meninges at 12 h post\u2010inoculation (hpi), and not at the site of the inoculation in the frontal lobe.17, 19, 23 During 24 to 48 hpi, infected CD11b+ cells appear in the ventricular cavity followed by infection of cell components of the ventricular wall, before viral spread into the brain parenchymal cells.17, 18 The ventricular wall is also the target site during th einitial phase of infection with other species of viruses, including herpes simplex virus24 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.25\n",

            "text": "The manner of the viral spread after infection with cl\u20102 or srr7 indicated that there could be some other routes of viral entry into the brain parenchyma than crossing over the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB), which has been almost exclusively studied or hypothesized as the mechanism of neuropathogenic viral entry into the brain parenchyma,26, 27, 28, 29, 30 including a pioneering study of poliovirus using gene\u2010manipulated mice introduced by the human\u2010type polioviral receptor\u2010gene.31 However, the mechanism of viral distribution of a neurovirulent strain of polioviruses, the Mahoney strain, infecting motor neurons in the CNS, was not elucidated through studies of its ability to circumvent the BBB in comparison with that of an attenuated viral strain, Sabin strain.32 Our investigation to identify the viral entry route focused on the area between the fourth ventricle (IVv) and meninges in the cerebellopontine angle, because viral antigens are often found in the area during the early phase of infection between 24 to 48 hpi,17, 18 and there is a conduit, the foramen of Luschka, for CSF to flow from the ventricle into the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space. Another intriguing feature of viral antigen localization after infection with cl\u20102 or srr7 is that the viral antigens were found in fibrous structures, which appeared to be the extracellular matrix (ECM), in the brain and spleen.17, 18 Viruses proliferate and produce viral antigens in living cells, and it is unusual to find them in the ECM area through a light\u2010microscopical observation. However, such colocalization of viral antigen or viral particles with the ECM has been reported to occur in the lymphoid organs. After infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), viral antigens are colocalized with the components of reticular fibers, including collagen III and laminin, in the spleen.33 Similar phenomena have been reported in infection with extremely virulent viruses, such as Ebola,34 Marburg and Lassa viruses.35 These viruses infect fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) in the lymphoid organs, followed by immune dysfunction leading to viral persistence33 or tissue destruction.35\n",

            "text": "FRCs are considered to maintain reticular fibers, which compose fibroblastic reticular network (FRN) in the lymph nodes36, 37, 38 and spleen.39, 40 Erasmus University Rotterdam thymic reticulum antibody 7 (ER\u2010TR7) has been used to define FRCs,33, 41, 42 although the antigen of ER\u2010TR7 has yet to be determined. Furthermore, there have been no reports on the size or determinant of the antigen using immune reactions, including Western blotting or immunoprecipitation. Each reticular fiber comprising the FRN is around 1 \u03bcm in diameter, and contains collagen fibers as a core surrounded by an ER\u2010TR7 antigen\u2010positive (ERag+) microfibrillar layer, and is further enclosed with a basement lamina at the outer surface. The entire fiber is largely ensheathed by FRCs.43 The FRN functions as a conduit system for immunocompetent cells and inflammation\u2010associated molecules such as cytokines and ligands or foreign antigens to reach appropriate sites in order to cause immune reactions in the lymph nodes44 and spleen,39 or to guide homing of the cells.40, 42 Subsequently, FRCs, which are podoplanin (gp38)\u2010positive (Pod+) and CD31\u2010negative (CD31\u2212), have been reported to co\u2010operate with other stromal cells in the lymph nodes, such as Pod+ CD31+ lymphatic endothelial cells, Pod\u2212 CD31+ blood endothelial cells, and Pod\u2212 CD31\u2212 myofibroblastic pericytes, to play a key role in the FRN function,45, 46 indicating that there should be organ\u2010specific specialization of the fibroblastic stroma. In this report, we show the virus antigens detected in the brain as fibrous structures colocalized with ERag and laminin as the same images, as previously reported in the spleen infected with LCMV.33 This finding encouraged us to prove the expression of ERag along the reticular system in the brain, which could function as a scaffold for viral entry and inflammatory cell invasion into the brain.",

This virus was propagated and titrated using DBT cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma, Tokyo Japan), as previously described.14 Specific pathogen\u2010free inbred BALB/c mice purchased from Charles River (Tokyo, Japan) were maintained according to the guidelines set by the committee of our university. For the experiment with infectious agents, mice were transferred to a biosafety level 3 (BSL\u20103) laboratory after permission from the committee. At 7\u20138 weeks old, each mouse was inoculated with 1 \u00d7 102 of cl\u20102 virus into the right frontal lobe under deep anesthesia. As described previously,17 the scar caused by the needle tip was found in the right frontal lobe after post mortem examination. Between 12 and 72 hpi, organs including the brains and spleens were removed from treated or untreated mice after exsanguination under deep anesthesia. Parts of the organs were embedded in Tissue Tek OCT (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan) and frozen to prepare frozen sections. Remaining portions were processed for viral titration, or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde buffered with 0.12 mol/L phosphate (PFA) for pathological examination using paraffin\u2010embedded sections to check that each experiment had been appropriately performed as we previously reported using cl\u20102 for infection,15, 17 and no contradiction was found (data not shown). Some mice were perfused with PFA from the aorta via the left ventricle under deep anesthesia using diethyl ether and 0.2 mg of chlorar hydrate (Mylan Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) per mouse to obtain sections for the detection of dexran labeled with Texas Red, for the three\u2010dimensional construct, or for double or triple immunostaining that includes podoplanin detection.",

Because of variable AFI levels in individual mice, especially in infected mice showing high SDs, a significant increase of AFI in the area of cl\u20102\u2010infected mice compared with that of sham\u2010infected mice at 48 hpi was obtained in the deeper area of the fourth ventricle, 300\u2013500 \u03bcm inside from the outermost portion of the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle (OV) (Fig. 2B).

The expression of ERag was either colocalized with that of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as laminin (Fig. 1D) and collagen (Fig. 1E) in the same way as reticular fibers reported in lymphoid organs,33 or found without such colocalization as shown in the brain parenchyma (Fig. 1D2 and D3) and trigeminal root (Supplemental Figure S1A). In the ventricle, we also found ERag without an association with other ECM (Figs 1E and 4D), which indicated that there could be immature ERfibs formed during initial events of the host reaction, compared with the mature form of ERag+ reticular fibers associated with several kinds of ECMs observed in lymphoid organs.33, 45, 47 Therefore, we compared the length of ERfibs colocalized with laminin in the ventricle between those of infected and sham infected mice, and found a greater difference between those in the two groups (Fig. 2C) than on comparison of ERfibs alone.",

Mice infected with the virus showed the infiltration of many particles of dextran along with ERfibs into a deep area in the ventricle (Fig. 3A and Supplemental Figure S1B). A few dextran particles were detected in the hilum of the ventricle near the border with the meninx of sham\u2010infected mice (Fig. 3B), and no trace of the particles was seen in the ventricles of mice with no treatment (Fig. 3C). The dextran particles were appropriately introduced into the recipients, because a high level of the particles was seen in the spleen of mice with no treatment along with Erfbs, especially in the marginal zone around the follicle (Fig. 3D), and partially in the follicle (insert in Fig. 3D), as previously reported.39 The viral antigens were detected in the ventricle of cl\u20102\u2010infected mice in a similar way as dextran particles. In the deeper area of the ventricle at the positions corresponding to b and c in Figure 3E, viral antigen\u2010positive cells closely associated with ERfibs were observed (Fig. 3G and H, respectively). However, in the area near the junction between the meninges and ventricle at position a in Figure 3E, the viral antigens did not always distribute along with ERfibs (Fig. 3F), possibly because viruses brought into the ventricle earlier than in the deeper area had time to induce the antigens in the infiltrated and domestic cells after infection. Because viral antigens are already detectable in cells of the monocyte lineage (MoCs) that have infiltrated the meninges during the initial phase of infection at 12 hpi,17 CD11b\u2010positive (CD11b+) cells as a carrier to transport viruses into the ventricle were examined. Double staining for CD11b and ERag revealed a close association of MoCs and ERfibs in the ventricle (Fig. 3I). As expected, many of the CD11b+ cells in the ventricle were infected (Fig. 3J).",

In the meninx, most of the ERfbs seemed to localize together with collagen based on the view of the integrated image (Fig. 4A). However, rotation of the image revealed a sheet composed of ERfbs and collagen fibers in a fine striped pattern (Fig. 4C and Supplemental movie S1). At the meninx with inflammation, many cells were observed, after triple staining for the nucleus, ERfibs and collagen, in the narrow space between the sheets composed of an association of ERfibs and collagen (Fig. 4B). Another finding obtained from three\u2010dimensional analysis was that a hammock\u2010like structure composed of fine ERfbs hanging on bold lines of laminin, which were partially colocalized with Erfibs, was formed in the ventricle (Fig. 4E and Supplemental movie S2), which could have been ignored on non\u2010specific staining based on typical confocal images of two dimensions because of their overly faint staining.",

A thick Pod+ layer in the meninges was colocalized with ERag (Fig. 5B), most of which could be produced by fibroblasts, which are located in the meninges.49 Some podoplanin\u2010negative (Pod\u2212) cells (arrowheads in Fig. 5B) as well as structures making up the basal area (arrows in Fig. 5B) of meninges were also found to be ERag+. In the ventricle, some of the ependymal cells with cytokeratin expression were found to produce ERag. In the brain parenchyma, many GFAP\u2010positive astrocytes, especially those comprising glia limitans at the brain surface (Fig. 5F), or near the border with the peripheral nerve (Fig. 1C), were found to be ERag+. Deep in the parenchyma, ERag+ astrocytes were observed around the blood vessel (Fig. 5G). However, in the brain parenchyma, many ERag+ cells without colocalization with laminin (Fig. 1D3), which were not located around the blood vessels, were seen. Furthermore, astrocytes situated away from blood vessels deep in the brain parenchyma, even though they had contact with ERag+ cells, did not produce ERag (Supplemental Fig. S1D). Therefore, we examined other cell types which produce ERag in the brain parenchyma, and found ERag+ neurons and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 5H, I), in addition to endothelial cells (Fig. 5J) and pericytes (Fig. 5K) of blood vessels (Bv) in the brain parenchymal area (PaBv). However, brain parenchymal CD11blow cells (arrowheads in Supplemental Fig. S1E), possibly microglia,50 as well as infiltrating CD11bhigh cells in the meninges (arrows in Supplemental Fig. S1E) and ventricle (Fig 3I) were ERag\u2212.

One of the reasons that such an important role of ERfibs to operate a conduit system in other organs was not described could be that the authors might have been obliged to limit the character of ERag+ structures, because an increase of these structures in injured regions, which were examined at around 1 week or more after the treatment of the mice, might not be large enough to trace and prove that they function as a conduit system. For example, ERag+ structures in the meninges have been reported to be found only in the sulcus52 where the arachnoid membrane does not exist. In contrast, our results showed high expression of ERag+ structures in the arachnoid membrane. The reason why we could trace the ERfibs could be that the virus cl\u20102 is an extremely neurovirulent strain, leading infected mice to a morbid state in 48 hpi.8, 9, 14 The more vigorous the insult is, the more extended the host reaction would be. Actually, the increased thickness of the arachnoid membrane formed during concentrated time periods after the infection enabled us to observe the architecture of a striped pattern consisting of ERfibs and collagen fibers, forming the sheet of a thin membrane. Each of the sheets was approximately 0.7\u20131.0 \u03bcm thick, which corresponds to the diameter of each reticular fiber serving as a unit of the conduit system in the lymphoid organs,43, 45 and the sheets had been considered to be meningeal fibers on the two\u2010dimensional observation of thin sections. Furthermore, between the sheets, many cells were detected, many of which should be infected CD11b+ cells.17, 18 A classic neuropathological understanding of the sites of infiltrating cells observed in meningitis has theoretically assumed a subarachnoid space between the arachnoid membrane and pia mater. The ERfib\u2010embedded sheets may guide inflammatory cells after extravasation to migrate into the meningeal region, but on the other hand, the sheets might restrict the inflammatory lesion in the meninx blocking the direct spread of inflammatory cells and viral particles from the meninx into the brain parenchyma. At least at 48 hpi, the prevention of direct invasion of the inflammatory cells and viruses from the meninx to the brain parenchyma seemed to be successful, as has also been observed in meningitis induced by other infectious agents.55, 56, 57 Before our findings, such prevention was thought to be operated by the pia mater and astrocytes comprising glia limitans at the brain surface,58 because inflammatory cells and infectious agents have been considered to be able to freely move around the presumed subarachnoid space.",

            "text": "The increase in ERfibs after infection had already occurred at 12 hpi. However, the possibility that all of the newly formed ERfibs function analogous to FRN in the lymph nodes and spleen is not conceivable, because invasions of CD11b+ cells and viruses into ERag\u2010upregulated areas were not prominent at 12 hpi. In addition, although ERfibs in the fourth ventricle, especially near the area of the junction of the ventricle and meninx, were increased in sham\u2010infected mice compared with non\u2010treated mice, fluorescence\u2010labeled dextran particles, which have been used as tracers to show the function of FRNs in the spleen,39 were not detected in the fourth ventricle. In contrast, in cl\u20102\u2010infected mice, labeled dextran particles were found in the ventricle showing a close association with Erfibs. This and subsequent findings indicated that ERfibs need to be allied with some other substances including ECM components detected in FRN to function as a scaffold. The ERfibs in the ventricle of infected mice were co\u2010localized with laminin at a higher level compared with those of sham\u2010infected mice. In addition, ERfibs that appeared at 12 hpi were not co\u2010localized with laminin, although in the area of peripheral nerves there were high levels of pre\u2010existing laminin as a component of the basement membrane around Schwann cells. Another immature form of ERfibs appeared after the three\u2010dimensional construction of images. In the fourth ventricle, an ERag+ net\u2010like structure was found hanging on two pole\u2010like structures of laminin, without forming firm fibers. The findings were supported by a study using a primary brain mix culture, where several stages of ERag+ expression with various types of association with ECM were observed (data not shown). Besides collagen and components of the basement lamina including laminin,43 several kinds of molecules, such as decorin, biglycan and fibromodulin, which are surrounded by the ERag+ matrix and localized to the conduit core,45 are supposed to be engaged in the maturation of FRN with the ERag+ matrix to function as a conduit in the lymph nodes. In addition, FRCs, a core cell population to maintain the ECM and conduit system in the lymph nodes, produce large amounts of other molecules involved in the matrix and elastic fiber assembly, including lysyl oxidase (LOX), LOX\u2010like 1, microfibril\u2010associated glycoprotein 2 (MFAP\u20102), MFAP\u20105 and fibulin\u20101.45 Future studies should elucidate the roles of these factors in regulating the reticular network in the brain.",

In addition, to our surprise, all kinds of the brain parenchymal cells except for CD11blow cells, provbably microglia, showed ERag expression. In spite of these findings, it is not plausible that the ERag produced by brain parenchymal cells was directly employed in the conduit system to guide the invasions of the virus or inflammatory cells, as indicated in the meninges and ventricle, because the viral antigens and inflammatory cell invasions were not observed at 48 hpi in the large area where they were produced by brain parenchymal cells. Furthermore, most of them were not colocalized with laminin fibers, except for the close association of GFAP+ and laminin+ fibers around the blood vessels, where the basement membrane is formed facing astrocytes at the side of blood vessels even under normal conditions.26 However, the colocalization of ERag and laminin+ fibers around the blood vessels was detected. The results indicate that a conduit system could be created around the PaBv, because information that virus\u2010bearing CD11b+ cells had invaded the meninges and ventricle must reach to the area with ERag expression in the brain parenchyma.",
