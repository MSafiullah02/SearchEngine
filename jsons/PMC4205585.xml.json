One of their most notable features is the segregation of B cells and T cells into discrete domains that consitute structural and functional units for optimal activation of cells of the immune system1,2. These specialized environments are inhabited by different subsets of mesenchymal stromal cells, which are commonly viewed as serving a scaffolding function for T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Current dogma holds that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) within the paracortical region coordinate T cell responses, whereas follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within the cortex support B cell responses. However, precise understanding of how the stromal network of lymphoid organs controls adaptive immunity has not been achievable due to limitations in technology for targeting each of the mesenchymal cell populations.",

Expression of the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 by FRCs, in addition to the expression of other adhesion molecules, facilitates chemokine receptor CCR7\u2013dependent homing of naive T cells and provides essential guidance cues to dendritic cells that migrate from nonlymphoid tissues into the lymph node paracortex6,7,8. Additionally, the production of interleukin 7 (IL-7) by FRCs is thought to be essential for preservation of the peripheral T cell pool under homeostatic conditions9. FRCs have also been found to control the extent of proliferation of newly activated T cells through the regulated release of nitric oxide10,11,12.",

            "text": "The two stromal cell populations commonly characterized within the lymph node cortex include FDCs and marginal reticular cells (MRCs). FDCs are characterized by localization within B cell follicles, expression of the complement receptors CR1 (CD35) and CR2 (CD21) and the FDC marker FDCM1 and the ability to display opsonized antigens to B cells. Expression of B cell\u2013trophic factors (the chemokine CXCL13 and the prosurvival factor BAFF (also known as BlyS, TALL-1, TNFSF13B or TNFSF20)) is often attributed to FDCs, which links these cells to shepherding B cells to follicles, supporting B cell survival and coordinating the germinal center reaction13,14,15,16. Published work using a system to ablate FDCs has provided definitive evidence that although this stromal subset is critical for germinal center responses, it has only a minor role in B cell homeostasis within resting lymph nodes17. Likewise, loss of FDCs is not mirrored by a decrease in the abundance of transcripts encoding BAFF (Tnfsf13b; called 'Baff' here), which indicates the presence of an alternative source. Such observations have led some investigators to postulate that MRCs, which reside in close proximity to the subcapsular sinus of lymph nodes18, serve these functions. However, data supporting this hypothesis are not yet available, so the cell population that supports B cell homeostasis within primary follicles has remained unconfirmed.",

In the Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 iDTR progeny, administration of DTxn caused rapid and extensive depletion of FRCs but spared other stromal cell populations. Our data demonstrate that ablation of FRCs led to marked alterations in the homeostasis and compartmentalization of T cells, with profound consequences for the activation, population expansion and effector function of viral antigen\u2013specific T lymphocytes. Unexpectedly, the loss of FRCs also led to substantially reduced B cell viability and altered follicular organization, followed by marked impairment in humoral immunity to T cell\u2013dependent and T cell\u2013independent viral antigens. Mechanistically, we determined that a subset of FRCs residing within lymphoid follicles established a favorable niche for B lymphocytes via production of BAFF.",

To address this limitation, a Ccl19-Cre mouse line has been generated that permits targeting of FRCs19. By crossing the Ccl19-Cre line to a line of mice expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) from the Rosa26 locus (Rosa26-eYFP), we generated Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 Rosa26-eYFP reporter mice in which eYFP expression is achieved following Cre-mediated excision of a loxP-flanked transcriptional 'stop' sequence (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy of lymph nodes from Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 Rosa26-eYFP mice revealed expression of the Ccl19-Cre transgene in the T cell zone (Fig. 1a,b), which supported the conclusion of efficient excision of loxP-flanked loci in the expected location. Flow cytometry demonstrated eYFP expression in FRCs, identified as nonhematopoietic cells that expressed PDPN and were negative for the endothelial marker CD31 and the cell-adhesion molecule MadCAM-1 (CD45\u2212PDPN+CD31\u2212MadCAM\u2212) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b). We did not detect eYFP expression in other lymph node stromal cells, including lymphatic endothelial cells (CD45\u2212PDPN+CD31+), blood endothelial cells (CD45\u2212PDPN\u2212CD31+) or integrin \u03b17\u2013expressing pericytes (CD45\u2212PDPN\u2212CD31\u2212) (Fig. 1c), which confirmed the specificity of the Ccl19 promoter. Despite published reports suggesting a close developmental relationship between FRCs and MRCs (CD45\u2212PDPN+CD31\u2212MadCAM+)20, MRCs did not seem to be targeted by the Ccl19-directed Cre recombinase, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy showing the absence of eYFP expression in MadCAM-1+ cells lining the subcapsular sinus (Fig. 1c\u2013e).",

In the resulting progeny, cells with an active Ccl19 promoter (FRCs) express the simian DTR and are selectively vulnerable to toxin-induced apoptosis when exposed to DTxn. A single injection of DTxn into these mice was sufficient to achieve rapid and extensive ablation of FRCs from lymph nodes (Fig. 2a\u2013c). FRCs were lost as early as 24 h following the administration of DTxn (Fig. 2a\u2013c), and the deletion was specific, as we did not detect changes in cellularity of other lymph node stromal populations, including lymphatic endothelial cells, blood endothelial cells and integrin \u03b17\u2013expressing pericytes (Fig. 2d). Consistent with FRCs' being the predominant source of CCL19 (refs. 8,9), expression of Ccl19 in lymph nodes was abrogated after ablation of FRCs, whereas expression of genes shared with other cells, such as Ccl21 (ref. 8), was only partially reduced (Fig. 2e,f). Thus, we were able to detect MadCAM-1+RANKL+ cells along the lymph node subcapsular sinus of mice that had undergone ablation of FRCs (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 1d), which confirmed a lack of Ccl19 promoter activity in MRCs. In line with that finding, the abundance of transcripts encoding the cytokine RANKL (Tnfsf11), which is shared by MRCs and FRCs8,18, was reduced only partially in total lymph node mRNA preparations after ablation of FRCs (Supplementary Fig. 1e), despite complete abrogation of Ccl19 expression (Fig. 2e).",

However, those effects were not symptomatic of a global collapse of lymph node architecture, as ablation of FRCs perturbed neither the integrity nor the permeability of the conduit network (Fig. 3c). The administration of DTxn was not associated with systemic toxicity, and it did not lead to weight loss or extranodal pathology (Supplementary Fig. 2a and data not shown). Furthermore, we did not observe accumulation of either neutrophils (CD11b+Gr1hi) or monocytes (CD11b+Gr1\u2212 or CD11b+Gr1lo) or increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c), which ruled out the possibility of extraneous inflammation secondary to the ablation of FRCs.

Notably, we also observed a global reduction in the number of T cells in lymph nodes (Fig. 4b), with CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells affected equally by the loss of FRCs (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). Moreover, expression of the gene encoding the T cell\u2013survival factor IL-7 was also reduced in lymph nodes from mice in which FRCs were ablated (Fig. 4c), which suggested that diminished T cell viability may have compounded the reduction in T cell numbers. To assess the effect of ablation of FRCs in adaptive T cell responses, we immunized Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 iDTR mice with a replication-incompetent influenza A virus expressing the OT-II ovalbumin peptide and monitored the generation of antigen-specific T effector cells (Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). Loss of FRCs resulted in diminished priming of antigen-specific T cells (Fig. 4d,e), as well as reduced activation and proliferation (Fig. 4f\u2013h). Furthermore, we observed a deterioration of antiviral T cell responses in a coronavirus-based vector system23 in which we monitored the generation and effector function of exogenously transferred CD8+ T cells with transgenic expression of a T cell antigen receptor specific for the coronavirus spike protein before immunization with coronavirus vectors24 (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Strikingly, generation of the virus-specific T cell response was also profoundly disrupted, with reduced numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and defective interferon-\u03b3 production in mice in which FRCs were ablated (Fig. 4i,j). Together our data demonstrated a critical role for FRCs in the homeostasis, positioning and activation of T cells.",

In splenic white pulp, where the Ccl19 promoter was active in both FRCs and CD31\u2212PDPN\u2212 (double-negative) cells19 (Supplementary Fig. 4a), the administration of DTxn efficiently targeted eYFP+ stroma (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c), with a substantial decrease in the abundance of FRCs and CD31\u2212PDPN\u2212 (double-negative) cells (Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). The ablation of FRCs had no effect on splenic weight or cellularity (Supplementary Fig. 4f,g) but markedly altered white pulp architecture (Supplementary Fig. 4h). B cell numbers were also reduced in the spleen (Supplementary Fig. 4i), although to a lesser extent than in lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. 4j). Functionally, the effects observed in the spleen affected marginal zone humoral responses, with a significant decrease in IgM production upon immunization with the antigen TNP-Ficoll (2,4,6-trinitrophenyl linked to the hydrophilic polysaccharide Ficoll) (Supplementary Fig. 4k). As the Ccl19 promoter was also active in Peyer's patches19 (Supplementary Fig. 5a), we investigated the fate of Peyer's patches following the ablation of FRCs. Systemic administration of DTxn elicited less substantial disruption of populations in Peyer's patches than in the spleen or lymph nodes, with smaller reductions in the number of FRCs and B cells than those in the spleen or lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). Similarly, we observed no major anatomical alterations, with the exception of a paucity of T cell clusters in interfollicular regions (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Together these observations indicated an unanticipated regulation of B cell homeostasis by FRCs and suggested that damage to the FRC network had deleterious consequences on the cellular circuitries that underpin humoral responses.",

Donor B cell numbers were markedly reduced at both time points in the lymph nodes of mice in which FRCs were ablated (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The homing of B cells to lymph nodes depends on the chemokines CCL19 and CXCL12 (ref. 27), and Cxcl12 expression in FRCs has been documented8. Indeed, Cxcl12 expression was considerably reduced in mice in which FRCs were ablated (Supplementary Fig. 6b), and FRCs were sufficient to elicit B cell chemotaxis in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 6c), which suggested that FRCs recruited B cells, possibly via CXCL12 and CCL19. Notably, blockade of lymphocyte ingress (via treatment with an antibody that blocks the lymph node\u2013homing receptor CD62L) was not sufficient to appreciably perturb B cell numbers in the first 24 h after treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6d), in contrast to the rapid B cell loss observed in mice in which FRCs were ablated (Fig. 5a,b). Additionally, preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes with FTY720 (an antagonist of the receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate) did not completely restore B cell numbers following ablation of FRCs (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Together these data suggested that while B cell entry required an intact FRC network, impaired B cell trafficking accounted for only part of the reduction in B cell numbers following the ablation of FRCs. That consideration prompted us to investigate the possibility that FRCs might regulate additional aspects of B cell homeostasis. Consistent with this hypothesis, B cell loss in mice in which FRCs were ablated coincided with a significant increase in propidium iodide\u2013positive B cells (Fig. 6a,b), which linked FRCs to the promotion of B cell survival.",

            "text": "Most efforts to characterize FRCs have thus far focused on their roles in supporting the homeostasis, migration and activation of T cells. However, a discrete population of FRCs was also present in and around follicles (B cell zone FRCs; Fig. 6c), and we reasoned that such a locale could position FRCs to directly interact with and influence B cells. That observation, together with the decreased survival of B cells observed in mice in which FRCs were ablated, led us to hypothesize that FRCs might provide critical survival factors for naive B cells. In this context, BAFF has a critical role in survival of mature B cells28,29. The key source of BAFF in secondary lymphoid organs has been identified as a radiation-resistant cell30, with FDCs often being considered the sole BAFF-producing stromal cell31. Thus, we reasoned that the phenotypes of mice in which FRCs were ablated might have been secondary to a decrease in the abundance or function of FDCs. To determine if FDCs were directly targeted in our system, we ascertained whether the Ccl19 promoter was active in FDCs in situ by fluorescence imaging of Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 Rosa26-eYFP mice. As shown by staining of the FDC marker FDCM1 and CXCL13, eYFP was absent from most FDCs in steady-state lymph nodes (Fig. 6d). We detected less staining of eYFP in a small number of FDCM1+ processes (Fig. 6d), possibly due to the tight interconnections that exist between FRCs and FDCs in follicles4,32. Additionally, to investigate the status of FDCs in mice in which FRCs were ablated, we assessed lymph nodes by quantitative microscopy at various time points after the administration of DTxn. Our data demonstrated that FDCs were present 24 h after such treatment (Fig. 6e; quantification, Fig. 6f), despite profound loss of FRCs (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, FDCs remained functionally competent at this time point, as demonstrated by their ability to correctly display exogenous immunocomplexes (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Prolonged exposure to DTxn led to a progressive reduction in FDC volume, as shown by a decrease in the integrated intensity of FDCM1 staining (Fig. 6e,f) and decreased CD35 staining as well (data not shown). Notably, contraction of the FDC network appeared to be transient and was followed by the reappearance of FDCM1+ cells 3 d after ablation of FRCs (Fig. 6e,f). We next compared mice in which FRCs were ablated (Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 iDTR mice treated with DTxn) with mice in which FDCs were ablated (lethally irradiated Cd21-Cre \u00d7 iDTR mice reconstituted with wild-type bone marrow and treated with DTxn). Direct comparison of the ablation of FRCs and that of FDCs revealed that loss of FRCs rapidly abrogated Baff expression in vivo, while depletion of FDCs did not (Fig. 6g). Together these results indicated a previously unrecognized regulatory role for FRCs in maintaining the amount of BAFF and the viability of B cells. Accordingly, we observed the large decrease in B cell numbers only in mice in which FRCs were ablated, not in mice in which FDCs were ablated (Fig. 6h). Notably, ablation of FRCs perturbed Baff expression without perturbing the expression of APRIL, a closely related member of the tumor-necrosis factor superfamily (encoded by Tnfsf13) (Fig. 6i,j). Moreover, the impaired expression of Baff mRNA in mice in which FRCs were ablated was mirrored by a similar abrogation in the abundance of BAFF protein, as assessed by confocal microscopy of lymph node sections (Fig. 6k). Notably, the concentration of BAFF in serum was unperturbed in mice in which FRCs were ablated (Supplementary Fig. 7b), which indicated that FRC loss influenced local BAFF production rather than perturbing a systemic reservoir. Furthermore, by injecting carefully 'titrated' DTxn into the footpad, we were able to achieve anatomically restricted ablation of FRCs and, consequently, B cell loss only in the draining popliteal lymph nodes without disrupting distal lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. 7c,d). Thus, the functional consequences of FRC depletion on B cell homeostasis were mediated mainly by a local effect in the organ in which the ablation occurred.",

            "text": "The data shown so far suggested that FRCs might directly promote B cell survival by serving as a nonredundant source of BAFF, in agreement with published studies demonstrating expression of Baff mRNA in highly purified FRCs8. Confocal microscopy in situ of FRCs in the B cell zone revealed that these cells were indeed able to produce BAFF (Fig. 7a). In line with that finding, we also observed BAFF production by flow cytometry in a discrete fraction of freshly isolated FRCs (Fig. 7b). Notably, BAFF was rapidly cleaved from the cell surface in a protease-dependent manner, similar to other molecules that belong to the tumor-necrosis factor superfamily (Supplementary Fig. 7e). BAFF+ cells were characterized by the expression of several canonical markers of FRCs, including PDPN, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, CD44, cadherin-11, CD140\u03b1 and CD140\u03b2, VCAM (the endothelial ligand for integrin \u03b14\u03b21) and fibroblast-activation protein (Fig. 7c), which supported the proposal that these cells were nearly identical to FRCs. Thus, our data suggested that FRCs positioned in follicular regions contributed to B cell homeostasis by providing the prosurvival factor BAFF. To directly test that hypothesis, we cultured B cells in the presence or absence of FRCs and measured B cell viability by staining the cells with propidium iodide, followed by flow cytometry. Notably, B cells cultured in the presence of FRCs exhibited significantly greater viability than that of B cells cultured alone (Fig. 7d). The elevated number of propidium iodide-negative B220+ cells in cultures with FRCs could not be accounted for by proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 7f). To ascertain whether the survival advantage conferred by FRCs was due to a soluble factor, we cultured B cells with stromal cells in separate compartments of a Transwell chamber or with FRC-conditioned medium. In both conditions, B cells exhibited enhanced viability (Fig. 7e), which indicated the presence of a soluble prosurvival factor derived from FRCs. Next we sought to determine whether the prosurvival factor contributed by FRCs was BAFF. For this, we preincubated FRC-conditioned medium with a BAFF-specific blocking antibody before adding the medium to B cells. Strikingly, the enhancement of B cell survival was largely abrogated following neutralization of BAFF (Fig. 7f). In sum, our data have described a subset of FRCs that delineated the borders of B cell follicles in lymph nodes (FRCs in the B cell zone) and nurtured B cells through the production of BAFF (Supplementary Fig. 8).",

The ablation of FRCs caused a substantial reduction in T cell numbers in resting lymph nodes and marked impairment in antigen-specific T cell responses. Unexpectedly, the ablation of FRCs was not immediately accompanied by collapse of the structured conduit system, which suggested that the lymph node infrastructure can persist and function despite a lack of support from stromal cells.

            "text": "Using the genetic approach noted above, we made the unexpected observation that FRCs supported B cell homeostasis and the generation of humoral responses. While most lymph node FRCs reside in the T cell\u2013rich paracortex, some localize to the vicinity of follicular conduits near the subcapsular sinus4,32. Our identification of Ccl19-Cre+ cells in B cell follicles (FRCs in the B cell zone) confirmed that FRCs span both the inner regions and the outer regions of the lymph node33. Unexpectedly, we found that FRCs in the B cell zone constituted a nonredundant source of BAFF. The source of BAFF in secondary lymphoid organs has been identified as a radioresistant cell30 often attributed to FDCs. That concept has been confounded, however, by reports that abrogation of signaling via the receptor for lymphotoxin-\u03b2, which is critical for the development and maintenance of FDCs, does not affect BAFF expression or B cell numbers34,35,36,37. Further, a Cd21-Cre system for the conditional ablation of FDCs has provided evidence that these cells are dispensable for BAFF expression and the survival of naive B cells17. Although the possibility that FDCs contribute to BAFF production and their ablation induces compensatory upregulation by other cells cannot be excluded, these studies collectively have indicated an alternate source of BAFF in resting lymph nodes. On the basis of our data, we propose that FRCs in the B cell zone represent this source of BAFF and thereby directly support B cell homeostasis. The disrupted follicular organization in mice in which FRCs were ablated may have also contributed to decreased B cell survival, as FRCs in intact lymphoid organs would coordinate the migration of naive B cells from high endothelial venules to BAFF-rich follicles. Furthermore, while ablation of FRCs did not appear to impede the flow of lymph through the lymph node conduit network, it may have affected the ability of migratory dendritic cells to deliver tissue-derived antigens to T cells and B cells and thus may have contributed to the diminished antibody production observed in Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 iDTR mice. Collectively, our findings indicated that alterations in lymph node stromal composition can have catastrophic consequences on immunological competence, with decreased lymphocyte viability and disorganized spatial organization of T cell and B cell responses.",

In this context, stromal cells are thought to arise from a primordial mesenchyme in the lymph node anlagen, which initially develops into lymphoid tissue\u2013organizer cells38. Colonization by B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes after birth then promotes the development of conventional stromal subsets. The similar pattern of expression of cellular markers by MRCs and lymphoid tissue\u2013organizer cells suggests that MRCs differentiate into FRCs and FDCs and continuously supply additional stromal subsets18. If indeed FRCs arise from MRCs in adult lymph nodes, then the Ccl19 promoter must be silenced in MRCs. Furthermore, our studies indicated that most FDCs were devoid of promoter activity and should thus be refractory to DTxn-induced apoptosis. A few cell processes from FDCM1+ cells displayed weak positivity for eYFP. However, given the tight association between FRCs and FDCs in follicles4,32, it remains difficult to discern between true promoter activity in these FDCs and proximity to eYFP+ FRCs in follicular regions. In this context, we observed functionally competent FDCs early after the administration of DTxn, when profound loss of FRCs had already occurred, which suggested that FDCs were not directly targeted in this system. Consequently, the decrease in staining of FDCM1 at later time points, probably mediated by contraction or de-differentiation of the FDC network, may have arisen from as-yet-unrecognized crosstalk between FRCs and FDCs. Our finding that contraction of the FDC network was transient and was rapidly followed by a regeneration phase is notable. One potential explanation for this is that damage to the FDC network, secondary to FRC loss, may induce MRCs to generate new FDCM1+ cells39.",

Our results have demonstrated heterogeneity of the FRC network and indicated functional specialization of FRCs in the T cell zone versus those in the B cell zone. BAFF+ FRCs in follicles shared common signatures with canonical FRCs, which suggests some relationship between them. However, they differed in their localization, and we did not find BAFF-producing cells in T cell areas. As mesenchymal cells are typically highly flexible in nature, depending on the surrounding environment, it is possible that BAFF production by FRCs in the B cell zone is maintained by microanatomical cues. Several functions associated with T cell immunity have been assigned to FRCs3,4,5,6,7,9,19,26,40, yet the requirement for these cells in humoral responses has not been addressed. Our finding that the homeostasis of B cells and T cells was governed by a common stromal cell expands the understanding of the stromal network and underscores its central role in immunity.",
