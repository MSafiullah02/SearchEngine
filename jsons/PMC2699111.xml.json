            "text": "SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae, group 2b. The genome encodes a 5\u2032non-structural gene ORF1ab, structural genes S, E, M, N and accessory genes in ORFs 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 (Frieman et al., 2008). S, M and E are embedded in the envelope. Trimers of the spike (S) protein form large club-shaped protrusions that are responsible for virus adsorption to its receptor and cell fusion. Each 150\u2013180 kDa spike monomer has receptor-binding activity in S1, the N-terminal half and fusion activity in S2, the C-terminal half (Li et al., 2006). S1/S2 are not cleaved during maturation. The large external S1 domain binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major cellular receptor found on ciliated nasotracheal epithelial cells, lung alveolar cells and intestinal enterocytes but not found on T cells, B cells or macrophages in the spleen and lymphoid organs (Li et al., 2003b, Chen and Subbarao, 2007). Virions have uncleaved viral spikes and during entry through endocytic vesicles or through fusion at the plasma membrane, viral spikes are cleaved by cathepsin L (Li et al., 2006, Bosch et al., 2008). Trypsin cleavage of the spike prior to infection also permits entry through the plasma membrane (Bosch et al., 2008). Factor Xa, a membrane bound protease, cleaves SARS S protein into functional S1 and S2 subunits and allows viral entry (Du et al., 2007).",

Using Brilliant\u00ae SYBR\u00ae green Q-PCR master mix from Stratagene (Stratagene Inc, La Jolla CA.) to provide precise quantification of initial target in each PCR reaction, the amplification plot was examined at a point during the early log phase of product accumulation. This is accomplished by assigning a fluorescence threshold above background and determining the time point at which each sample's amplification plot reached the threshold (defined as the threshold cycle number or CT). The threshold is a numerical value assigned automatically by the software for each run above the calculated baseline. The CT value assigned to a particular sample thus reflects the point during the amplification reaction at which sufficient number of amplicons has accumulated above the baseline. After a suitable threshold is selected, the data are analyzed and CT values for each sample determined. Differences in threshold cycle number (CT) are used to quantify the relative amount of PCR target contained within each tube. Relative expression of mRNA species is calculated using the comparative CT method. Briefly, for each sample, the difference in CT values (\u0394CT) was calculated for each mRNA by taking the mean CT of duplicate tubes and subtracting the mean CT of the duplicate tubes for the reference RNA (\u03b2-Actin) measured on an aliquot from the same RT-reaction.\u0394CT=CT(test gene)\u2212CT(\u03b2-Actin)The \u0394CT for the treated sample was then subtracted from the \u0394CT for the untreated control sample to generate a \u0394\u0394CT.\u0394   \u0394CT=\u0394CT(treated sample)\u2212\u0394CT(untreated control)\n",

In order to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation, we examined the effect of pretreatment of cells with TPCK, an NF-\u03baB inhibitor that inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 protease (Henkel et al., 1993). PBMC cultures (104-105\n cells) or THP-1 cultures (106\n cells) were pretreated with 25 \u03bcM TPCK for 20 min, followed by S protein treatment and incubation in the presence of TPCK for 24 h. Treated with S protein alone, TPCK alone or mock-treated served as controls. Production and secretion of IL-8 into the supernatant medium was measured by ELISA. Our results showed that in PBMC, S protein alone increased IL-8 significantly (1714 \u00b1 432 pg/ml versus control 275 \u00b1 330 pg/ml, p\n = 0.0005) whereas pretreatment of PBMC with TPCK significantly reduced the amount of IL-8 produced in response to S protein (1714 \u00b1 432 pg/ml versus S protein with inhibitor, 94 \u00b1 157 pg/ml, p\n = 0.024, 95% inhibition). In mock-treated PBMC with inhibitor 66 \u00b1 113 pg/ml of secreted IL-8 was produced Fig. 5A. Similarly, in THP-1 cells, S protein alone increased IL-8 significantly (1403 \u00b1 79 pg/ml versus control 863 \u00b1 48 pg/ml, p\n = 0.017) whereas pretreatment with TPCK significantly reduced the amount of IL-8 produced in response to S protein (1403 \u00b1 79 pg/ml versus S protein with inhibitor, 3.4 \u00b1 3.2 pg/ml). In mock-treated THP-1 cells with inhibitor <1.5 pg/ml of IL-8 was produced Fig. 5B. Next, the effect of TPCK inhibitor on IL-8 secretion in HCoV-229E-infected PBMC was measured during one cycle of virus replication (8 h post-infection). TPCK only partially inhibited the secretion of IL-8 and the effect was not seen until 6 h after infection suggesting that post-entry events were involved Fig. 5C. TPCK toxicity for virus-infected cells was measured by plaque assay. HCoV-229E yield was 38% lower in PBMC cultures in the presence of 25 \u03bcM TPCK. Virus titer with TPCK was 4.7 log10 versus 5.13 log10 pfu/ml without TPCK at 8 h post-infection. Our results indicated that NF-\u03baB activation was required for production and secretion of IL-8 in response to treatment of PBMC or THP-1 cells with S protein. However, TPCK treatment was not sufficient to completely inhibit IL-8 production and secretion in PBMC infected with HCoV-229E at MOI of 1.",

(2006) found that in acute phase SARS patient sera, levels of IL-8 were highly variable but were significantly different from healthy controls. In genetic studies, differential expression between the IL8 promoter variant alleles showed significant association (p\n < 0.001) with cystic fibrosis lung disease severity (Hillian et al., 2008). Our results showed that S protein at concentrations 5.6 nM significantly increased IL-8 mRNA abundance in PBMC. IL-8 production and secretion could be enhanced in PBMC by more than one mechanism including direct activation by S protein and indirect priming via IL-8 receptor which was shown to be increased in SARS patients (Yu et al., 2005). Secreted spike could be produced during virus infection (Pulford and Britton, 1991).",

            "text": "Since the SARS syndrome is characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory response and NF-\u03baB is the major transcription factor activated in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fan et al., 2001), we sought to determine whether S protein-induced IL-8 production is mediated by NF-\u03baB activation. We examined the activity of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, TPCK. This NF-\u03baB inhibitor acts by inhibiting IKB\u03b1 protease so that IKB\u03b1 is not proteolytically degraded and NF-\u03baB is not released to undergo nuclear translocation (Henkel et al., 1993). We observed that the addition of TPCK before treatment with S protein significantly inhibited IL-8 secretion suggesting that NF-\u03baB activation was required for S protein-induced IL-8 secretion. TPCK partially inhibited IL-8 secretion in HCoV-229E-infected PBMC and also reduced the virus yield. These effects on HCoV-229E- infected PBMC could be due to inhibition of proteases and possibly to induction of apoptosis (Zhu et al., 1997). HCoV-229E spike resembles SARS-CoV spike. Both SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E spikes do not contain furin recognition sites and are uncleaved in the virion (Li et al., 2006). Cathepsin L cleavage separates the receptor-binding subunit (S1) from the membrane anchored fusion subunit (Li et al., 2006). Both viruses use clathrin-mediated endocytosis for ACE2 or CD13 (human aminopeptidase N) receptor mediated entry (Yeager et al., 1992, Inoue et al., 2007). Inhibitors of cathepsin L, a cysteine protease, block cell fusion and entry via endocytosis for both viruses (Bosch et al., 2008, Li et al., 2006; Kawase et al., 2009). TPCK is an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases and prevents MHV spike cleavage in L2 cells (Mizzen et al., 1986). This class of inhibitors did not block SARS S1 cleavage from the spike trimer (Huang et al., 2006). However, Factor Xa, a membrane bound protease, could cleave SARS S protein into functional S1 and S2 subunits and Ben-HCl, an inhibitor of trypsin and serine proteases, inhibited cleavage and effectively blocked viral entry (Du et al., 2007). Thus, in addition to NF-\u03baB inhibition, TPCK might prevent S protein cleavage. Further work is necessary to address this issue.",

TLR2, like all TLRs, activates a common signaling pathway that culminates in the activation of NF-\u03baB (Barton and Medzhitov, 2003). TLR2 is predominantly expressed at high levels on macrophages in humans and can be activated by several viruses or viral components (Finberg et al., 2007). Plasmacytoid cells use the TLR pathway for viral defense (Barton and Medzhitov, 2003). Other cells use cytosolic RNA receptors RIG1-like helicases (RLHs) and MDA-5 (Uematsu and Akria, 2007) and nucleic acid recognizing TLRs 3,7,8 and 9 that are critical in the regulation of the production of type 1 IFNs in response to virus infection (Finberg et al., 2007). TLR2 is not an IFN\u03b2 inducer (Barton and Medzhitov, 2003). IFN\u03b2 mRNA did not increase in S protein-treated PBMC in our experiments (data not shown).

A dose of 5.6 nM per 2 \u00d7 105 PBMC increased IL-8 secretion significantly compared to mock-treated controls. The ability of S protein to increase IL-8 mRNA was mediated by activation of NF-\u03baB possibly via TLR2 ligand and could be inhibited by the NF-\u03baB inhibitor TPCK. The ability to detect elevated NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity in the nucleus in response to S protein suggests that this most likely occurs by the mechanism of induction. Moreover increased secretion of IL-8 and IL-6 cytokines indicated that levels of proinflammatory mediators could be enhanced by S protein interaction with monocyte macrophages and could stimulate NK, neutrophil and monocyte migration to the site of infection.",

Secreted IL-8 is expressed as pg/ml (mean \u00b1 SE of three separate experiments). Statistical significance was determined using the student's t-test based on comparison of S protein-treated with the mock-treated control for each time point. Our results indicated that S protein treatment increased IL-8 production in a dose dependent manner and that 5.6 nM gave a statistically significant response compared to control.",

(A) RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, cDNA amplified and IL-8 gene expression was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Relative expression of mRNA species was calculated using the comparative CT method. Statistical significance was determined using the student's t-test based on comparison with the mock-treated control for each dose. Significant differences in IL-8 mRNA abundance were observed when the PBMC were treated with S protein \u22655.6 nM compared to control (p = 0.047, data of three separate experiments) while E protein did not increase IL-8 mRNA levels. (B) Secreted IL-8 concentrations at 24 h following S protein and E protein treatment of PBMC were determined by ELISA. IL-8 concentration increased in S protein-treated PBMC in proportion to mRNA abundance whereas secreted IL-8 did not increase in E protein-treated PBMC, compared to control.",
