Novel coronavirus (nCoV), also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is responsible for this deadly disease. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has declared that nCoV is highly genetically similar to SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 (\u223c 89% similarity). Limited number of clinically validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data is available in the literature. With this hypothesis, the present work focuses on developing a computational model for nCoV-Human protein interaction network, using the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-Human protein interactions. Initially, level-1 and level-2 human spreader proteins are identified in SARS-CoV-Human interaction network, using Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. These proteins are considered as potential human targets for nCoV bait proteins. A geneontology based fuzzy affinity function has been used to construct the nCoV-Human protein interaction network at \u223c 99.98% specificity threshold. This also identifies the level-1 human spreaders for COVID-19 in human protein-interaction network. Level-2 human spreaders are subsequently identified using the SIS model. The derived host-pathogen interaction network is finally validated using 7 potential FDA listed drugs for COVID-19 with significant overlap between the known drug target proteins and the identified spreader proteins.",

            "text": "COVID-19 evolved in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) 1 . The first case of human species getting affected by nCoV was observed on 31 December 2019 2 . Soon it expands its adverse effect on almost all nations within a very short span of time 3 . World Health Organization (WHO) observes that the massive disastrous outbreak of nCoV is mainly due to mass community spreading and declares a global health emergency on 30 January 2020 4 . After proper assessment, WHO presumes its fatality rate to be 4% 5 which urges the global researchers to work together to discover a proper treatment for this pandemic 6, 7 . Coronaviridae is the family to which a corona virus belongs. It also infects birds and mammals besides affecting human beings. Though the common symptoms of corona virus are common cold, cough etc., but it is accompanied by severe acute chronic respiratory disease along with multiple organ failure leading to human death. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are the two major outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 respectively before SARS-CoV2. The source of origin of SARS was located in Southern China. Its fatality rate was within 14%-15% 8 due to which 774 people lost their lives among 8804 affected cases. Saudi Arabia was marked as the base for the commencement of MERS. 858 persons among 2494 infected cases were defeated in their battle against MERS virus. Thus it generated a much higher fatality rate of 34.4% 9 when compared to that of SARS. All of the three epidemic creators SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV2 are biologically included in the genus Betacoronavirus which is under the family Coronaviridae. Both structural and nonstructural proteins are involved in the formation of SARS-CoV2. Out of the two, structural proteins like the envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and the spike (S) protein play a major role in transmitting the disease by binding with the receptors after entering into human body 10 . No clinically proven and approved vaccine for nCoV is available till date though researchers have been trying hard to develop it. So there is an urgent need to understand and analyse the mechanism of disease transmission of this new virus.",

Progression of Infection and disease results in due to the interaction of proteins in between pathogen and host. Pathogen plays an active role in spreading infection. It has been proved to be an acute threat to human lives as it has the mutative capability to adapt itself toward drugs. Pathogen and host PPIN permits pathogenic microorganisms to utilize host capabilities by manipulating the host mechanisms in order to abscond from the immune responses of the host [11] [12] [13] . Detection of target proteins through the analysis of pathogen and host PPIN is the central point of research study 14, 15 . Topologically significant proteins having higher degree of interactions are generally found to be essential drug targets. However, proteins having less number of interactions or topologically not significant may be involved in the mechanism of infection because of some biological pathway relevance. However, clinically validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data is limited in the current literature. This has motivated us to develop a new computational model for nCoV-Human PPI network. We have subsequently validated the proteins involved in the host-pathogen interactions with respect to potential Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drugs for COVID-19 treatment. Key aspects of this research work are highlighted below:",

To identify the interactors of SARS-CoV2 on human using the Fuzzy PPI model, a set of candidate proteins are selected as the L1 and L2 spreader nodes of SARS-CoV using SIS model (as depicted in Figure 1 ). Fuzzy PPI model is constructed from the ontological relationship graphs by evaluating the affinity between all possible GO pairs annotated from any target protein pair and finally the fuzzy score of interaction affinity of protein pair is computed from these GO pair-wise interaction affinity in to a range of [0,1] (details are discussed in the Methods). The heatmap representation of fuzzy interaction affinities (with score \u2265 0.2 for very high specificity ~ 99%) is shown in supplementary Figure  S1 and Table S4 . The high quality interaction (HQI) is retrieved at threshold 0.4, (almost ~ 99.98% Specificity) which results total 78 interactions between SARS-CoV2 and Human (37 proteins).

Not every protein in an interaction network has intense disease spreading capability. In this work, we have used the SARS-CoV-Human PPIN network and the spreader nodes at both level-1 and level-2 using the SIS model. These spreader nodes are considered for computing the protein interaction affinity score to unmask the level-1 human spreaders of nCoV. GO annotations have been also taken into consideration along with PPIN properties to make this model more effective and significant. With the gradual progress of the work, it has been observed that the selected human spreader nodes, identified by our proposed model, emerge as the potential protein targets of the FDA approved drugs for COVID-19. The basic hypotheses of the work may be listed as follows: \u2022 There is a genetic overlap of ~ 89% (as suggested by ICTV) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, which also leads to a significant overlap in spreader proteins between human-SARS-COV and human-SARS-COV2 protein-interaction network. \u2022 Fuzzy PPI approach can assess protein interaction affinities at very high specificity with respect to benchmark datasets as shown in Figure 6 . High specificity signifies very low false positive rate at a given threshold. Thus, at 0.4 threshold (~ 99.9% specificity), the proposed model evaluates high quality positive interactions in Human-nCoV PPIN.",

We also identify the human spreader proteins (up to level-2) using spreadability index, validated through SIS model. Due to high network density in human interaction network, number of proteins increase with the transition from one level to another. So, our proposed model is also capable of identifying human spreader proteins in level-2 by using spreadability index which is validated by SIS model. Target proteins of the potential FDA drugs for COVID-19 are found to overlap with the spreader nodes of the proposed computational nCoV-Human protein interaction model. Target proteins of seven potential FDA drugs: Lopinavir 30 , Ritonavir 31 , Hydroxychloroquine 32, 33 , Azithromycin 33 , Remdesivir 34-36 , Favipiravir 37, 38 and Darunavir 39 for COVID-19 as mentioned in the DrugBank white paper 26 overlap with the spreader nodes of the proposed in silico nCoV-Human protein interaction model (see Figure 5 ). Though clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine in 2020 are on their way till date but three out of the seven i.e. Remdesivir 46 Hydroxychloroquine 47 and Favipiravir 47 are found to be the most promising as well as effective ones and their protein targets R1AB_SARS2, TLR9, ACE2, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 are also successfully identified as spreader nodes by our proposed model.

The transmission of infection starts when a pathogen enters a host body and starts infecting its protein which in turn affects its directly or indirectly connected neighborhood proteins. Considering this method of transmission, PPIN of human and SARS-CoV are considered to detect spreader nodes. Spreader nodes are those nodes proteins which actually transmits the disease fast among its neighbors. But not all the nodes in a PPIN are spreaders. So, proper detection of spreader nodes is crucial. Thus, spreader nodes are identified by spreadability index which actually measure the transmission capability of a node protein. Compactness of PPIN and its transferal capability is evaluated using centrality analysis. Nodes having high centrality value are usually considered as spreader nodes or the most critical node in a network.",

They are: 1) Node weight 48 2) Edge ratio 49 and 3) Neighborhood density 49 . Nodes having high spreadability index are considered as spreader nodes. The spreader nodes thus identified are also validated by SIS model 25 . SIS model is implemented with a motive of designing the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 outbreak into a disease model consisting of proteins based on their present infection status. A protein can be in either of one of the three states: 1) S: Susceptible, which means that every protein is initially susceptible though it is not yet infected but is at risk of getting infected by disease. 2) I: Infected, which means that the protein is already infected by the disease and 3) S: Susceptible, which means proteins again become susceptible after getting recovered from infected state. This model is implemented in such a way that it generates the overall infection capability of a node after a certain range of iterations. Thus the sum of the infection capability of the top selected spreader nodes are computed by this model which is compared against the sum obtained for the selected top critical nodes by other existing centrality measures like Betweenness Centrality (BC) 50 , Closeness centrality (CC) 51 , Degree centrality (DC) 52 and Local average centrality (LAC) 53 .",

Fuzzy PPI model is a hybrid approach 24 that utilizes both the topological 57 features of the GO graph and information contents 56, 58, 59 of the GO terms. GO is organized in three independent directed acyclic graphs (DAGs): molecular function (MF), biological process(BP), and cellular component(CC) 23 . The nodes in each GO graph represent GO terms and the edges represent different hierarchical relationships. In this work, two most important relations 'is a' and 'part of' has been used for GO relations 29 . The semantic similarity between any two proteins is estimated by considering the similarities between their all pairs of annotating gene ontology (GO) terms belonging to a particular ontological graph. The similarity of a GO term pair is determined by considering certain topological properties (shortest path length) of the GO graph and the average information content (IC) 60 of the disjunctive common ancestors (DCAs) 54, 55 of the GO terms as proposed in 24 . Fuzzy PPI first rely on a fuzzy clustering of the GO graph where the selection of GO terms as cluster center is based on the level of association of that GO term in the GO graph. The cluster centers are selected based on the proportion measure of GO terms. The proportion measure for any GO term t is computed as",
