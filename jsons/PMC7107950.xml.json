The study was approved by the university and institutional review boards, and all adults provided informed consent to participate in the study. CAP was defined by the presence of acute respiratory symptoms for <1 week and a chest radiograph displaying new pulmonary infiltrates. Exclusion criteria included immunodeficient conditions (ie, human immunodeficiency virus, active treatment for cancer, organ transplant, immunosuppressive therapy) and hospitalization within 30 days preceding enrollment. Clinical information at admission and hospital course were extracted from hospital charts of all patients and entered in a computer database. Patient severity was assessed during the first 48 hours after enrollment according to the pneumonia severity index described by Fine et al [15].",

A fragment of N gene was amplified by rtPCR with 10 \u03bcM (each) N1 and N2 primers [18], 1X Master SYBR Green I (Roche), and 2 \u03bcL of cDNA. The reaction was carried out for 10 minutes at 94\u00b0C and then for 50 sequential cycles at 94\u00b0C for 10 seconds, 58\u00b0C for 5 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds in a LightCycler 1.5 instrument (Roche). A negative (water) and 2 positive controls (RNA from RSV working pool) were included in each assay. Heat-inactivated sera were tested by microneutralization assays for RSV/A/Tracy (A2-like virus) and RSV/B/18537 to measure RSV/A and RSV/B-specific neutralizing antibodies as described previously [12].",

Paired serologic study was available in 19 adults with RSV-positive rtRT-PCR, and the results were concordant in only 4 cases (Table 4).",
