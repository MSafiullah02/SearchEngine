The goals of mechanical ventilation are to ensure adequate oxygenation, carbon dioxide elimination and respiratory muscle unloading, and to decrease the oxygen cost of breathing. While mechanical ventilation has been proven to be extremely effective for managing a variety of patients [1, 2], it is associated with a risk of ventilator-induced lung and diaphragm injury [2, 3], especially if ventilator settings are not optimized. For instance, permitting higher plateau pressures (pressure at end-inspiration when there is no flow) or higher tidal volumes can result in dangerously high levels of lung stress and strain [4], which may lead to the development of acute lung injury [5].",

Earlier CDSSs were mostly rule-based systems that used clinical heuristics\u2014simplified decision-making strategies that use only a few available parameters\u2014to select ventilator settings [6]. Rule-based systems attempt to achieve specified ventilation targets [7, 8] or maintain a patient\u2019s ventilatory parameters within a predetermined comfort range [9]. They are designed to help clinicians by providing them with suggestions on what actions to take when the conditions for the actions are met. However, these systems do not consider the physiological differences between patients, or even the same patient at different times in the disease process, and thus do not ensure that the suggested actions are optimal for each individual patient at any point in time. In addition, rule-based systems do not provide clinicians with insight into a patient\u2019s physiological state. In contrast to rule-based CDSSs, physiologically based CDSSs are useful for optimizing ventilator settings for individualized patient safety, predicting the effects of various ventilation strategies, and monitoring a patient\u2019s overall physiological status [10].",

Some physiologically-based CDSSs focus primarily on modeling pulmonary gas exchange and ensuring safe and adequate oxygenation and CO2 elimination [11\u201315]. Others integrate lung protection as a ventilation target but rely on indirect parameters of lung stress (tidal volume) and patient effort (respiratory rate, oxygen consumption) [16]. Preliminary data suggest that a CDSS designed in this way achieves safe ventilatory conditions in patients who are weaning from mechanical ventilation [17]. It is uncertain whether this approach would effectively avoid both overassistance and under-assistance diaphragm myotrauma\u2014 [3, 18]. Moreover, existing systems do not account for the effects of sedation on respiratory drive and inspiratory effort [19\u201321]. Finally, existing CDSSs operating under pressure support ventilation, a common mode of assisted ventilation, do not incorporate the expiratory cycling threshold; this important setting determines patient-ventilator synchrony and can substantially modify the volume delivered by the ventilator. Incorporating this setting into the CDSS might significantly enhance the effectiveness and tolerability of ventilation.",

            "text": "In this paper, we propose a novel integrated physiological model that can provide the foundation for a CDSS targeting both lung and diaphragm protection under two paradigmatic modes of assisted ventilation, pressure support and proportional-assist ventilation. The latter was included as a prototypical mode where ventilator support is proportional to patient effort. Compared to existing models, our model is the first to (1) focus on the effects of respiratory effort on lung as well as diaphragm injury; (2) output target indicators theorized to directly reflect the risk of lung and diaphragm injury [18, 22\u201324]; (3) consider the impact of propofol, a common drug used to sedate patients under ventilatory care; (4) incorporate an expiratory cycling threshold under pressure support mode. While mathematical equations describing the dynamics of these four factors exist in the literature, to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to integrate them together into a single cohesive mathematical model. Section 2 describes the individual systems incorporated into the model, how they are integrated, and how outputs are generated. Section 3 demonstrates the validity and robustness of the model through a simulation study. Section 4 offers a discussion of the rationale for the model, how it compares to existing models, the results of the simulation study, and the model\u2019s limitations.",

The slope of the pressure support response can be decreased by increasing the flow-cycle threshold (Fig. 8c). For both pressure support and proportional assist, the introduction of propofol decreased the slope of the CO2 response (Fig. 8d). All of the outputs generated from the local neighborhood search under pressure support ventilation for both the maximization and minimization problems are shown in Fig. 9a. Removing the dominated points (points in which all three output values\u2014\u2206PL, \u2206PES, pH\u2014are smaller than another existing point) results in the maximum and minimum frontiers shown in Fig. 9c. This figure also shows the range of physiologically plausible values for each output as the bounding box.

These inputs were chosen as the primary control parameters because both propofol and ventilatory support are routinely used to modulate patient respiration. Propofol depresses the patient\u2019s response to hypoxia and hypercapnia [19, 39]. The level of sedation patients receive can thus have a significant effect on their ventilatory response and their respiratory effort level [20, 21]. Similarly, both modes of assisted ventilation included in the model have the primary goal of supporting patient ventilatory effort [34, 40], and are thus important for the model.",

Although the model is evaluated under steady-state conditions, determining both the central and peripheral chemoreflex drives is necessary as propofol, one of the chosen control parameters, only affects central chemoreflex receptors. Thus, the included respiratory control model was selected as it separates the impact of the central and peripheral chemoreflex drives on respiration, allowing the model to be more easily modified to include propofol. Furthermore, the selected model of respiratory control has been previously evaluated and fitted to testing results [41] and utilizes physiologically relevant parameters, which ensures that the overall model remains interpretable.",

In addition, the model does not allow for the modification of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The INVENT system [12] adapts the same respiratory control model but determines the hydrogen ion concentrations affecting each chemoreceptor. In the INVENT system, central chemoreceptor drive is dependent on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrogen ion concentrations while peripheral chemoreceptor drive is dependent on arterial hydrogen ion concentration. This increases the complexity of the system as a CSF acid\u2013base model is necessary, in addition to the model for blood acid\u2013base. Furthermore, while the increased specificity may improve system accuracy, it also introduces additional assumptions and limitations. In INVENT, the CSF strong ion difference is assumed to be a constant value estimated from venous blood bicarbonate. In addition, CSF hydrogen ion concentration is dependent on cerebral blood flow, which can change in response to changes in the bicarbonate concentration or arterial CO2 pressure and this variation is not accounted for by the CSF acid\u2013base model [43]. In contrast, the respiratory control model presented here is adapted directly [25] and accounts for the difference between the central and peripheral chemoreceptors only using the receptor thresholds. This greatly simplifies the overall model and does not introduce any additional assumptions or limitations, but likely increases simulation error (though the significance of such error is likely to be low as the model outputs are seen to be relatively insensitive to receptor thresholds).",

Hence flow-cycle proportion and pressure support have opposite effects on the output indicators (Online Resource 4, Fig. 3). Increasing levels of propofol have also been associated with decreasing the respiratory effort [21] and lowering blood pH (Online Resource 4, Fig. 4) [47\u201349].",

Figure 9c, d and Table 5 indicate that the target outputs from the pressure support simulations almost always lie within the defined physiologically plausible ranges. Overall, the simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the LDPV model. The results show that, for any set of clinically relevant inputs, the LDPV model will produce a set of outputs that are (at the very least) physiologically plausible. The results of the simulation also illustrate the range of possible outputs of the model; all model outputs are predicted to lie between the maximum and minimum Pareto fronts depicted. Although only 100 iterations were performed for each objective, the outputs of the simulation covered a wide range of values. Furthermore, the simulation considered all possible combinations of inputs, including combinations that may not even be physiologically plausible. While several parameters used static nominal values to reduce computational complexity, the model outputs can be seen to have low sensitivity to these parameters. Hence, using static values for these parameters should a low impact on the maximum and minimum Pareto fronts.",
