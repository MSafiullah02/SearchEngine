Few national data are available that measure how behavioural changes reduce the risk of HIV infection (Parkhurst 2008). Furthermore, process data such as the number of clients served or the number of condoms distributed are not very helpful measures (Davis et al. 2000). Better predictors of HIV prevention are consistent condom use versus \u201cever using a condom\u201d and the number of concurrent partners an individual has versus their number of lifetime partners (Parkhurst 2008).",

Non-formal education may therefore take place both within and outside educational institutions, and cater to persons of all ages. Depending on country contexts, it may cover educational programmes to impart adult literacy, basic education for out-of-school children, life-skills, work-skills, and general culture. Non-formal education programmes do not necessarily follow the \u201cladder\u201d system, and may have differing durations, and may or may not confer certification of the learning achieved. (p. 47)Some studies report that non-formal education programmes have mixed results (Vermund et al. 2009; Ellis 1995; Evans 1981). Critics of non-formal education say its effectiveness is too often assumed without proper evaluation, and that untested causal assumptions are frequently made about education and societal change (Benavot 2002). However, non-formal education serves as an alternative for populations that do not have readily available and accessible educational options (UNESCO 2006).",

For example, in a randomly controlled HIV prevention trial, researchers observed improvements in service delivery, including referrals for HIV testing and provision of condoms, when non-formal care providers received enhanced training in HIV case management (Shah et al. 2007). Peer education, anti-AIDS clubs, drama, art, youth dialogues, music, and comic books are some examples of non-formal education. Non-formal educational activities were a key determinant in the tremendous decline in HIV prevalence in Uganda, where the Ministry of Education and Sports introduced national-level prevention campaigns in 1986 (Jacob et al. 2006). These activities included media messages targeting youth and school theatrical performances that depicted real-life scenarios facing youth. Plays were presented in over 8,500 primary schools nationwide, also reaching a large proportion of out-of-school youth. Non-formal education is extremely important to HIV prevention, given that the majority of transmissions occur among young adults.",

From 1984 to 2009, the total number of reported cases was 3,654 (Philippines DOH 2009), but this figure may be inaccurate due to underreporting, as the United Nations estimates 6,000\u201311,000 cases (UNAIDS 2008). Table 1 shows the annual number of HIV and AIDS cases with combined numbers for 1984 to 2004, and annual numbers by major routes of transmission from 2005 to January 2009. Heterosexuals account for the highest number of cases in the Philippines; the second highest risk group is men who have sex with men (MSM)/bisexuals. The number of heterosexual transmissions has remained fairly stable during this period (about 137 new cases per year), but we see a significant and annually rising increase among MSM and bisexuals.\n",

In 1998, Congress passed Republic Act No. 8504, the Philippines AIDS Prevention and Control Act, which mandates a nationwide implementation of policies and measures to prevent and control the disease (PNAC 2008; Republic Act No. 8504 1998). A fourth AIDS Medium-Term Plan, 2005\u20132010, published by the PNAC (2003), outlines five key strategies that focus on strengthening and institutionalizing interventions. They are: (1) strategies targeting highly vulnerable groups (sex workers and their clients, IDUs, and MSMs), and overseas Filipino workers (OFWs); (2) institutional and general public preventive interventions; (3) the quality of treatment, care, and support services for people infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS, (4) stigma-reduction measures and efforts to integrate them into preventive treatment, care, and support services and into the design of management systems; and (5) management systems that support the delivery of HIV/AIDS information and preventive services (p. 18).",

They can best make such changes when they experience interventions to heighten their awareness and knowledge, along with enhanced resources and social support. Bandura conceptualized the basic elements of social cognitive theory as consisting of personal determinants in the form of cognitive, affective, and biological factors, behaviour and the environment. In this article we examine how various programmes have applied this theoretical framework to behaviours related to HIV/AIDS, by exposing participants to interventions designed not only to promote safer sex guidelines, but also to develop individual skills and self-beliefs that would enable them to reduce risks in the face of counteracting influences (Bandura 2004).",

More formally, it is the maximum force that Person A can place on Person B divided by the maximum resistance that B can offer. French and Raven (1959) further developed this conceptualization of power and social influence; they defined influence as a force one person (the agent) exerts on someone else (the target) to induce a change in the target, including changes in behaviours, opinions, attitudes, goals, needs, and values. Social power was later defined as the potential ability of an agent to influence a target. Raven (1965) further classified power according to the base from which it comes and listed six types: reward, coercive, legitimate, referent, expert and informational power.",

Since July of 2006, the NSP has expanded island-wide. In total, 1,103 health education and counseling service centers were set up, along with 418 vending machines providing clean needles. Roughly 8.2 million needles were given out between 1 November 2005, when the NSP was implemented, and 31 December 2008. In addition, over 777 recycling trashcans for used needles were set up, and the return rate for used needles increased from under 1% at the beginning to 80% currently; the average return rate is 61%.

Soon, however, infection among women increased rapidly. In 2006, the male-to-female ratio for newly reported cases rose to 7.4:1, but in 2008 it fell to 16.9:1. In Taiwan, most women who contract the disease do so through their sex partners, as sex workers, or through using injection drugs. At the end of February 2009, 41.57% of all HIV-infected women were between 20 and 29 years old (Taiwan CDC 2009). Women of childbearing age who are vulnerable to the disease need to get tested, especially if they have had an STD, are sex workers or IDUs, had multiple sex partners while pregnant or an HIV-infected sex partner, or if they engage in other high-risk behaviours. Early intervention and prevention of HIV infection among these vulnerable high-risk groups can prevent the spread of HIV, both horizontally and vertically. Consequently, since 2006, the DOH has included routine HIV screening in prenatal examinations. In addition, when police arrest illegal prostitutes, they immediately notify the local health department, which in turn conducts blood screening and connects the woman to a HIV health education and promotion campaign. Between January and September of 2008, police made 2,289 arrests of illegal prostitutes.",

As in Taiwan, prostitution is illegal in the Philippines. However, the Philippines health system requires all workers at entertainment establishments to register with the government and to receive regular STI health check-ups at the government clinic. Outreach, treatment, and regular screening of sex workers in the Philippines have led to STI declines among sex workers and their clients (Wi et al. 2006).

As part of a national surveillance system, 360 male IDUs were surveyed in Cebu City, Philippines, from 1997 to 1999. Although most of the men knew that certain behaviours put them at risk, more than two-thirds reported they shared needles and almost two-thirds of those who were sexually active said they never used condoms (Amadora-Nolasco et al. 2002). Other challenges include a conservative culture that discourages open discussion of sexuality, inadequate social and behavioural research and monitoring, high numbers of STIs, and the weak integration of HIV/AIDS programmes into local governments (UNAIDS 2008). Finally, the low rate of HIV testing among both the general and high-risk populations in the Philippines poses a major problem for detection and early treatment (PNAC 2008).",

The rapid increase in the HIV epidemic caused greater media attention and increased reporting. Also, over 60% of the new reports of infections were among the incarcerated population and resulted from mandatory HIV testing.

A notable strength of the Philippines in preventing HIV transmission is its system of registering sex workers, which enhances the non-formal education for this vulnerable group. A strength of Taiwan is its provision of free HAART to encourage voluntary testing. The mission of non-formal educational efforts should be disseminating knowledge and skills to prevent the disease\u2019s spread, and to increase service utilization.",

With respect to HIV prevention, non-formal educational activities play an important role for children who drop out of school or do not have the opportunity to attend as well as for the adult population and vulnerable groups. The education of female bar workers in the Philippines (Morisky et al. 2005) and the HIV education in the correctional systems for IDUs in Taiwan (Ko et al. 2009) are examples of best practices for designing, implementing, and evaluating non-formal educational programmes. Both countries draw upon the assistance of NGOs to carry out non-formal educational activities.",
