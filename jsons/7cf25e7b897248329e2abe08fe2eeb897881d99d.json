With its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics. However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or \"species\", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts.",

Ecology has a long history of quantifying the abundance and distribution of organisms and has been increasingly integrated into viral studies (Anthony et al. 2015 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . Traditionally, such efforts have focused on isolated cases of single host-single pathogen relationships (Telfer et al. 2010) . However, infected host individuals generally have multiple pathogens, and infection with one pathogen can affect infection, virulence, or disease emergence of the others (Pedersen and Fenton 2006 , Jolles et al. 2008 , Telfer et al. 2010 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . This suggests that perspectives and approaches from community ecology can complement current methods in virology.",

            "text": "Three major challenges exist when integrating community ecology and virology. First, most viruses are rare (i.e. exist at low prevalence; Tang et al. 2006 , Winker et al. 2008 , Wacharapluesadee et al. 2010 , Anthony et al. 2015 , so the probability of infection in a host individual is low. Consequently, large datasets of comprehensively sampled host populations are needed to address high levels of uncertainty associated with low viral prevalence. Few such datasets exist. Second, most wildlife viruses are unknown to science (Anthony et al. 2013 , Anthony et al. 2017 , Carlson et al. 2019 , and the process of defining viral species is timeconsuming (King et al 2012) . This means that waiting for official designations of viral species for use in community-level analyses does not address the urgency of current health challenges posed by wildlife viruses. Alternatives to official designation of viral species include delineating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using monophyletic groups (Anthony et al 2015) or percent identity histograms (Maes et al. 2009 , Anthony et al. 2017 ). However, both such methods rely on subjectively chosen cutoff points to differentiate OTUs. Finally, many viral infections last only hours to days, making detection difficult (Klenk et al. 2004 , Lee et al. 2009 , Henaux and Samuel 2011 , King et al. 2012 , Vetter et al. 2016 .",

Subsequent work shows that bats likely played a critical role in the evolution and diversification of herpesviruses (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2016) . Bats generally have a negative reputation as carriers of deadly viruses that cause human diseases such as rabies, Nipah, and SARS (Wibbelt et al. 2010) , and consequently, most research on bat viruses has focused on these pathogens of concern for public health. Although a number of studies have also detected herpesviruses in bats (Wibbelt et al. 2007 , Razafindratsimandresy et al. 2009 , Zhang et al. 2012 , Sasaki et al. 2014 , Pozo et al. 2016 , Zheng et al. 2016 , Holz et al. 2018 , Wada et al. 2018 , little is known about viral shedding, host specificity, or the diversity of herpesviruses in bats (Zheng et al. 2016) .",

To measure phylogenetic distinctness, hosts of the same genus are assigned a value of one, hosts of the same family but different genera are assigned a value of two, and hosts of different families have a value of three (Poulin and Mouillot 2005) . S TD * thus weighs host preference by the relatedness of hosts (incorporating evolution) and the prevalence of the pathogen in each of its hosts (incorporating ecology). The extent of viral sharing among hosts species was further examined by determining whether particular OTUs had a core host species. A core host species was defined as a single host species for which the OTU had significantly higher prevalence than in all other host species combined. To do this, the prevalence of each OTU in its core host and its combined prevalence in all other hosts were compared using Fisher's exact test (Wassertheil-Smoller and Smoller 2015) . For each OTU that infected more than one host individual, viral preference for host sex was examined by comparing OTU prevalence between male and females of the core host species, using Fisher's exact test. All analyses were done using R version 3.4.3, and code used for all methods can be found at github.com/ARSjodin. OTU Delineation: Both alignment techniques resulted in two similar, clearly differentiated potential cutoff ranges, as demonstrated by consistent peaks in the histograms (Figure 1) . The lower level of taxonomic grouping of OTUs was defined as those with a cutoff between 90 -92%. This means that two sequences with less than 90% genetic similarity would be considered to be different OTUs. The higher level of taxonomic grouping was defined as those with a cutoff between 74 and 80%. As such, two sequences with less than 74% genetic similarity would be considered to be different OTUs. The number of OTUs resulting from the cutoff extremes for both levels of classification, when total alignment and pairwise alignment were considered (74, 81, 90 and 93 PID cutoffs; Figure 1 ), were 29, 31, 42, and 47 OTUs, respectively. Affinity propagation resulted in 45 OTUs. Although OTU richness did not equal any values generated using the PID histograms, 45 OTUs is within the range of OTUs generated using the lower-level taxonomic cutoff (i.e. 42 -47 OTUs at 90 -93% PID cutoff), suggesting this cutoff is more strongly supported by affinity propagation than is the higher-level cutoff.",

Officially designating novel viral species requires substantial data, oftentimes full genome sequences, and approval by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses (King et al. 2012) . Consequently, OTUs are commonly used as proxies for species. Although multiple methods exist for delineating OTUs (e.g. histograms using percent genetic identity, Maes et al. 2009 ; or monophyletic groups, Anthony et al. 2015) , subjectivity is generally required to choose the best cutoff point in terms of genetic similarity (i.e. the histogram method) or evolutionary time (i.e. the monophyletic groups method). Affinity propagation is a machinelearning algorithm developed to cluster a broad range of data (e.g. images of faces, genes in a microarray, heavily travelled cities) and identify representative examples of each cluster (Frey and Dueck 2007) . The method has been used to cluster strains of rabies viruses (Fischer et al. 2017 ), but has never been used to identify viral OTUs for analyses in the context of community ecology. Here, we show that affinity propagation can be used as a quantitative complement, in congruence with currently defined herpesvirus species, to objectively support current methods of viral OTU delineation.",

While some surveys (e.g. Cone et al. 1993 , Kidd et al. 1996 , Phalen et al. 2017 show Generally, herpesviruses are highly host specific, but when host-virus relationships are examined at an evolutionary timescale, host switching has been the norm (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2016 , Azab et al. 2018 . As such, we expected herpesviruses that infected multiple host species to have core hosts. Overall, we found evidence of host sharing among bat species at Mata de Pl\u00e1tano Nature Reserve, regardless of cave. The existence of host sharing is further supported by viral prevalence and viral discovery curves. A higher prevalence at the populationlevel (i.e. a single species) than the community-level, as seen here (Table 2) , is consistent with host-specificity. Also, at the largest scale (i.e. the entire nature reserve), sampling completeness reached 80%. This is in contrast to accumulation curves for viral metacommunities infecting particular host populations, which were as low as 55% (P. quadridens). This suggests that undiscovered OTUs at the scale of host population have already been discovered at the scale of nature reserve (i.e. have already been discovered in another host species). This supports the hypothesis that certain OTUs that are common in a core host are rare in all other host species.",

Future studies with goals of monitoring public health should increase the number of sampled individuals for each host species to enhance the likelihood of uncovering patterns of host preference and reservoir status. Studies aimed at viral ecology will likely require focus on more prevalent viral taxa, such as herpesviruses, instead of rare viral taxa of more zoonotic concern, such as coronaviruses or filoviruses. Further ecological research should prioritize sampling host individuals from multiple field locations, addressing viral infection and transmission at multiple spatial scales, while decoupling the spatial and ecological mechanisms that shape viral community assembly.",
