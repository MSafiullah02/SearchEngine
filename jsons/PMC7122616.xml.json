The discovery of opium\u2019s ability to relieve pain stimulated the refinement of opium and generation of synthetic analogues to create more effective, potent, and faster acting analgesics. The social and economic value of opioid analgesics has remained high not only due to their demonstrated efficiency in mitigating pain but also their noteworthy ability to reliably produce pleasant rewarding psychological side effects. Consequently, at various times during the past several hundred years, opioid drugs have sparked wars, fueled black markets, driven up violence and cartel crime, and triggered numerous opioid addiction and overdose death epidemics around the world.",

The additional seductive pharmacological nature of these potent compounds, and the ability to administer doses directly into the bloodstream via hypodermic needles, producing intense euphoria, sedation, and hypnosis (sleep), can lead to some developing compulsive use and addiction. As societies have grappled with rising rates of use and addiction, some have reflexively reached for supply-centric policies to reduce access. While supply reduction is a major piece of the puzzle, without addressing the demand side of the equation, these approaches can have the inadvertent effect of shifting people who were using prescription opioids to the often cheaper, more readily available, but more lethal, options of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl.",

How we got here, what we can do about it, and how we can prevent it in the future, are the fundamental questions that we attempt to answer in this chapter. To begin, below we describe briefly the nature, structure, origin, and growth in the use of opioid analgesics and subsequently describe the etiology and epidemiology of the current crisis using broad public health and health belief models as frameworks to help guide understanding. In the second section, we describe the approaches that have been applied to address both supply (e.g., overprescribing) and demand (e.g., overdose intervention, pharmacological and psychosocial treatments) sides of the equation. In the final section, we review the lessons learned in an attempt to outline strategies to prevent future epidemics.",

The degree of use of pharmaceuticals, like many other commodities, is socially, economically, politically, and culturally based. The United States is among the largest global consumers of opioids, with prescribing rates that outpace many peer nations; however, while consumption of opioids in the United States is undoubtedly high, it has been overstated. For example, while it is commonly reported that the United States consumes \u201c80% of the world\u2019s supply of opioids,\u201d it is because within that figure are certain opioid medications that are exclusively marketed in the United States while other countries use similar, but slightly different, opioid compounds. Consequently, a more accurate estimate is that while the United States has approximately 4.4% of the world\u2019s population, it consumes about 30% of the world\u2019s global supply of opioids [2]. Still, as shown in Fig. 1.1, using standard daily doses per million inhabitants, relative to other middle- and high-income countries, opioid use is disproportionately high but not as high as is commonly stated. Perhaps the interplay of a strong biotech industry, capitalist consumer-oriented free market economy, and constitutionally based cultural expectations that explicitly endorse the right to \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d has promoted America\u2019s demand for rapid pharmaceutical remedies for pain and suffering. Within such an economic and sociocultural context, however, like many industrialized countries, the United States has sought to institute safeguards to curb the potential appetite for \u201ctoo much of a good thing.\u201d For example, it possesses among the strongest protections and regulations worldwide regarding quality and safety of medications, and administrative oversight regarding scheduling, prescribing, and marketing (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]; Prescription Monitoring Programs [PMPs]). As explained below, a number of forces converged to create the current overdose epidemic and opioid addiction crisis seen that has emerged since the late 1990s.\n",

The public health model of disease\nsuggests there are three major factors that interact to influence the spread of an epidemic: the agent (e.g., the presence of an environmental toxin; in this case, opioids), the host (i.e., the human beings exposed to the opioid), and the environment (e.g., the variables that can influence the degree to which the host is exposed to the opioid; see Fig. 1.1). To the extent that an agent (e.g., opioid) can cause harm to a host (person), the environment can play a crucial role in mitigating or exacerbating that harm. In the case of addiction or substance use disorder, more generally, this public health model of disease\nis complicated slightly further, because\u2014as is the case with opioids\u2014the agent is highly desired by the host since it can kill pain as well as produce intense pleasure. All other things being equal, if it becomes widely available, easily accessible, affordable, legal, and medically prescribed\u2014and thus has lower stigma attached to it\u2014its use will increase.

Unrelieved pain was considered to be a major, yet completely avoidable, public health problem. In 1997, a collaborative project was initiated to integrate pain assessment and management into clinical best practice standards. Furthermore, in 2001, all patient care organizations accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) were required to document proper management of pain, and pain became the \u201cfifth vital sign\u201d\u2014as integral to standard basic medical \u201cbest practice\u201d assessment as obtaining a patient\u2019s body temperature or blood pressure reading.

Price too was relatively low in the early years of the epidemic, because for the most part prescribed opioids were covered by insurance, or otherwise cheap. This fact tended also to bias in favor of White American consumers who more likely had health insurance, who were potentially more likely to be prescribed due to unconscious racial bias among physicians, and who, in contrast to prior opioid epidemics, became overrepresented among those overdosing on opioids. Compared to prior mostly male, urban-based, heroin epidemics of the 1960s where the average age of onset was around 16 years old, individuals misusing opioids between 2000 and 2014 were older (mean age, 22.9 years) men and women living in less urban areas who were introduced to opioids through prescription drugs (75.0%). Also, Whites and non-Whites were equally represented in those initiating use prior to the 1980s, but nearly 90% of those who began use between 2000 and 2014 were White [6].

States and insurers have begun passing legislation and implementing policies aimed at curtailing access to prescription opioids. While responsible and cautious prescribing of opioids is critically important to reduce unnecessary exposure and access for opioid-na\u00efve individuals to reduce the incidence of opioid use and use disorder, supply-focused strategies are unlikely to benefit people who are already using opioids, including those with opioid use disorder or chronic pain. Prescribing guidelines, such as the 2016 CDC guidelines [10], offered approaches for more judicious use of opioids limiting exposure to opioids in acute pain, continuously addressing the risk and benefit of opioid treatment, and screening and offering treatment for opioid use disorder. At the same time, these guidelines recognized the complexity of managing individuals who were started on high doses of opioids previously and the importance of safeguarding against patient abandonment in these scenarios in the case of opioid use disorder (Fig. 1.6).\n",

Particularly effective in treating opioid use disorder are the agonist therapies methadone and buprenorphine, with the latter being combined with naloxone to create a therapeutic hybrid buprenorphine/naloxone marketed as \u201cSuboxone.\u201d The most scientifically rigorous systematic quantitative reviews of placebo-controlled randomized trials indicate that buprenorphine is an effective medication in the maintenance treatment of heroin addiction, retaining people in treatment at any dose above 2 mg and suppressing illicit opioid use (at doses 16 mg or more) based on placebo-controlled trials. However, compared to methadone, buprenorphine retains fewer people when doses are flexibly delivered and at low fixed doses. If fixed, medium or high, doses are used, buprenorphine and methadone appear no different in effectiveness (retention in treatment and suppression of illicit opioid use) [12]. For prescription opioid addiction, similar results have been found (although the quality of evidence is not as good as it is for heroin addiction). Another rigorous systematic review of clinical trials, for example, found little to no difference between how well methadone and buprenorphine worked to keep people in treatment, to reduce opioid use, or in the side effect profile. The conclusion was that buprenorphine keeps more people in treatment, reduces opioid use, and has fewer side effects compared to detoxification or psychological treatment alone [13].",

Once per month injectable extended-release naltrexone, in contrast, fares better, especially when it is administrated following initial medically supervised withdrawal to achieve seven to ten days of opioid abstinence. In intent-to-treat analyses, buprenorphine is more effective as a treatment for opioid use disorder; however, among the subset of patients who are able to complete medically supervised withdrawal, extended-release naltrexone has similar efficacy to buprenorphine in preventing relapse to illicit opioids [15, 16].",

Adding specialized addiction counseling (e.g., CBT for addiction) to agonist medication, therapies that already come with brief 20\u201345-minute prescriber counseling and checkup\u2014a manualized intervention known as \u201cmedical management\u201d (MM)\u2014have not been shown to enhance outcomes among OUD patients [18]. The failure to show additional benefit for specific addiction counseling on top of MM and medications (e.g., buprenorphine/naloxone) may be because MM is likely to mobilize the same kinds of therapeutic mechanisms (e.g., recovery motivation, active coping, increased recovery self-efficacy) that are mobilized by all active interventions [19, 20] and, thus, adding an additional specific intervention does not confer additional benefit. Similar kinds of null effects have been found in other studies where psychosocial interventions are increased in intensity (e.g., from 5 hours of therapeutic contact to 20 hours) but do not confer increased therapeutic benefit [21]. There is some preliminary evidence for potential therapeutic synergy from extended community-based interventions, such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA) participation in addition to buprenorphine or methadone [22]. At least one large observational study found that opioid use disorder patients on buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone), who engaged more in NA, had significantly better retention on the medication and higher abstinence rates [23]. More studies are needed in these areas to help determine who in particular may benefit from these additional community services to aid long-term remission and recovery.",

For these patients, proven alternatives should be on the menu of additional options so that patients can choose another option that could help the patient engage and improve their quality of life. These may take the form of long-term residential options such as recovery housing [32], which have shown to be helpful and cost-effective along with the use of other recovery supports such as recovery community [33]. Such centers can assist in helping people get jobs and get connected to other recovery support services (e.g., recovery coaching) that can help sufferers build recovery capital and instill hope for the future.",

For such individuals, a variety of services and strategies have been developed and increasingly deployed to positive effect in many countries around the world. These are designed to reduce overdose deaths as well as lower the potential for transmission of infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis C. Quantitative reviews\nincluding meta-analyses support the implementation of such approaches [34, 35]. In the United States these have taken the form of syringe service programs, overdose education and naloxone (\u201cNarcan\u201d) distribution programs, and lower threshold treatment models. Other countries have expanded harm reduction even further to offer supervised injection facilities and supervised prescription heroin and injection programs (e.g., in the United Kingdom; [31]). While cities in the United States have begun exploring the possibility of opening supervised injection facilities, strong opposition from the federal government remains. Evidence mostly from studies conducted in two cities, Vancouver, Canada, and Sydney, Australia, supports the public health utility of safe injection facilities [36], but findings are somewhat mixed in high-quality studies in this domain. That said, there is no evidence that these facilities increase rates of drug use in any capacity. More research, however, is needed to understand the clinical and public health benefits related to these facilities and who in particular is likely to benefit from them.",

There has been an often-cited gap between practice and science for addiction treatment services, whereby practitioners either are not knowledgeable about or otherwise fail to implement science-based \u201cbest practices.\u201d In this instance, however, it was a slightly different take on this criticism. Providers believed or were led to believe that these potent medications were in fact safe from a scientific standpoint. So, it was not the traditional \u201cresearch\u2013practice gap\u201d that was to blame, but rather the misbelief, misinterpretation, and/or misapplication of the science. It is easy to see this in retrospect, but no one predicted it. The blithe acceptance and unquestioning citation by the medical community of a completely inadequate single publication regarding justification for safety were seized upon by the pharmaceutical industry. With seeming scientific assurance, the industry was able to deploy their significant public relations machinery to exert considerable weight and influence and subsequently increase prescribing of potent opioid medications to address pain. This effort was potentiated by a humane medical infrastructure push to address the debilitating human misery caused by acute and chronic pain. For a few years, while the focus lay on ensuring practitioners were assessing \u201cthe fifth vital sign,\u201d and prescribing accordingly, the waves on the surface appeared to be no cause for alarm. Yet, an invisible undertow was present and gathering momentum. This undercurrent would ultimately begin to sweep hundreds of thousands out to sea to drown beyond their depth, with even bigger waves of heroin and fentanyl to follow.",

The stigma and discrimination that pervades addiction meant a lethargic response to a rapidly growing public health crisis which, for almost any other health threat that might kill only a fraction of the number killed by the opioid overdose crisis, would have been met with greater alarm and more immediate and adequate appropriation from state and federal entities. A national response like those seen internationally to stem the threat from Ebola (Ebola virus disease [EVD]) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) would have curtailed this crisis. Instead, while the alarm bell was ringing there was a cultural and political deafness underwritten by prejudice against those suffering from addiction. This allowed an emerging crisis to grow and spread, change shape, and increase its toll until not a day passed without mention of the \u201copioid overdose crisis\u201d on media channels of every political orientation and flavor. Only when it was realized that the overdose crisis kills equally across party lines, and the tears from dozens of bereaved mothers had moistened the benches of congress, did government begin to come together to act; but it was too little, too late, for hundreds of thousands of families. The pervasive impact of racism in our society\u2019s response to addiction crises and people who use drugs cannot be overemphasized. In past drug epidemics when the communities most deeply affected were black and Hispanic/Latino, the overwhelming response was a tough-on-crime approach that resulted in mass incarceration. The notion that the current crisis is in fact a public health issue was strongly influenced by the narrative of the innocent white victim, deserving of compassion rather than punishment. Addressing these pervasive stigmatizing attitudes through increasing education about the nature of opioid and other substance use disorders, shifting our language and terminology so that it more accurately reflects the neurological and medical nature of these conditions [38, 39], and increasing the personal testimony from the millions already in recovery [40] who are willing to speak out and demonstrate that recovering \u201caddicts\u201d are like everyone else, are ways likely to help reduce the prejudice, stigma, and discrimination that has retarded and undermined an adequate, rapid, response to the current crisis.",
