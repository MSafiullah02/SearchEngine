The primary outcome, 30-day mortality, was assessed visually using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards. The final multivariate Cox proportional hazards model incorporated characteristics with a P value <.2 on bivariate analysis with administration of oral RBV forced into the model. The proportional hazards assumption was visually assessed using a plot of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals against time. A propensity score\u2013based analysis was performed to also control for confounding. To create the propensity score, a nonparsimonious logistic regression model incorporating all measured baseline characteristics (sex, race, transplant type, ISI score, site of infection, time from transplantation, GVHD, steroid use, nosocomial infection status) was created to model the probability of oral RBV treatment. This propensity score was used to generate inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) and a subsequent IPTW Cox proportional hazards model [16]. Progression from URI to LRI was assessed among patients treated at the URI stage using a Fine-Gray competing risk model, treating death as a competing risk for progression to LRI [17]. A traditional multivariate model and IPTW competing risk model were constructed.",

At our institution, aerosolized RBV remained unrestricted, but given the widespread publicity over the increased cost of therapy and ease of oral administration, a shift in use toward oral RBV occurred naturally over the last 3 RSV seasons.

To our knowledge, ours is the largest study to date that compared outcomes of oral and aerosolized RBV for RSV in HCT recipients. Thirty-day mortality rates were similar between groups, while 90-day mortality was significantly lower in recipients of oral RBV in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. As several other significant predictors of 90-day mortality reflect underlying high-risk transplants and relapse of the underlying malignancy, it is more likely that this reflects a degree of residual selection bias rather than a true efficacy signal. Although the number of patients at high risk (ISI \u22657) was relatively low, no indicators of increased mortality were observed in patients treated with oral RBV. Additionally, 30- and 90-day mortality was the same with oral or aerosolized RBV for patients with LRI, suggesting that the oral formulation is as effective as aerosolized therapy for lower respiratory disease.",

This finding was robust in both a standard Fine-Gray competing risk model and a propensity score\u2013based analysis. As with mortality, patients at high risk for progression did not appear to be at any additional risk if treated with oral RBV. These findings contrast with those of Casey et al, who evaluated 13 patients treated with oral RBV for RSV infection after allogeneic HCT (7 URI) [11]. In that cohort, URI progression was documented in every case and 3 patients (23%) died from respiratory failure. However, those patients were treated a median of 14 days following transplantation, so were high risk for progression regardless of treatment, whereas our cohort included the entire posttransplantation spectrum.",

Fifty-six patients at the University of Heidelberg were treated with oral RBV during an RSV outbreak, 32 of whom were HCT recipients and received oral RBV [25]. Multivariable analysis identified that treatment with RBV was a protective factor against fatal outcomes (P = .02). Marcelin et al assessed oral RBV administered to immunocompromised patients with RSV infection, including 25 recipients of HCT, with no patient deaths attributable to RSV [12]. More recently, Gorcea et al examined the effectiveness of oral RBV treatment of RSV in 23 allogeneic HCT recipients. No patients had a high-risk ISI score, and 4 patients were escalated to aerosolized therapy. After a median 17 months of follow-up, 17 of 23 patients (74%) were alive and only 1 death was RSV related [9].",

Additionally, the size of our institution and inclusion of 3 consecutive RSV seasons allowed for the inclusion of a large number of patients with different HCT types and risk strata, including relapsed disease. However, our study has some limitations. This was a single-center study that evaluated only HCT recipients; therefore, generalizability to nontransplant recipients and other institutions may be limited. Our study included low-risk HCT patients (ISI = 0\u20132) that may not require treatment with RBV; however, this group comprised a small portion (10%) of our cohort. Similarly, the number of patients in the high-risk group (ISI = 7\u201312) was low (15% of the cohort); thus, the impact of oral RBV in these high-risk patients needs further study. Last, our study was retrospective in nature and there were significantly more patients with lymphopenia in the aerosolized group, although this was not found to be independently associated with mortality on the multivariate analysis (Table 7).",
