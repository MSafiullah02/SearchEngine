(A) RT-qPCR showing the level of IL18BP expression, assessed with various probes (Materials and methods), and normalized against endogenous GAPDH, in EBV-B cell lines from six healthy controls (black), the WT brother (III.3, purple), and heterozygous family members: brother (III.2, red), father (II.4, blue), and mother (II.9, green). Relative IL18BP expression was determined by normalization against the mean value for WT cells, which was set to 1 (indicated by a dashed line). The values shown are the means of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. (B and C) Diagrams showing the design for 39 RACE on IL18BP performed on EBV-B cell lines (B) or COS7 cells (C) using the pTAG4 39 exon-trapping vector. Numbers on the canonical IL18BP transcript begin with the start codon at position 1 and end with the polyadenylation site, indicated by A n , at position 1,252. (D) Agarose gel electrophoresis showing aberrant splicing of IL18BP mRNA in 39 RACE on COS7 cells transfected with pTAG4 vectors carrying the WT or mutant IL18BP allele. HPRT1 was used as the housekeeping gene control. (E) The nested PCR products from D were cloned, and colonies were sequenced. Diagram (left) and percentages (right) of WT (gray) and mutant (M1 in blue, M2 in red, and M3 in green) splice variants are shown. Clones with PCR artifacts or sequences that do not match with canonical IL18BP transcript were excluded from analyses. (F and G) Expression of WT and mutant IL-18BP isoforms (M1-M3) in F-and four missense variants (p.V23I, p.R121Q, p.P184L, and p.Q192H) from GnomAD in G, was assessed in the concentrated supernatants from transiently transfected COS7 cells with either empty vector or constructs expressing indicated IL-18BP variants. Immunoblotting was performed with the His tag antibody (top). The membrane was then stripped and probed with the IL18BP antibody (bottom). The concentrated supernatants were used in the IL-18BP bioassay experiments shown in Fig. 2 F. (H) IL-18BP bioassay: IFN-\u03b3 production was measured in NK-92 cells upon stimulation with recombinant human IL-12 (100 pg/ml), IL-18 (10 ng/ml), and/or IL-18BP at varying concentrations (0, 125, 250, or 500 ng/ml). Graph is presented on a logarithmic scale with base of 10. The data shown are means \u00b1 SEM of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. (I and J) Expression of the mutant IL-18BP isoforms (M1-M3) carrying the common missense variant (p.R121Q) was assessed in the concentrated supernatants from transiently transfected COS7 cells with either empty vector or constructs expressing indicated IL-18BP variants. Two independent preparations are shown. Immunoblotting was performed with the His tag antibody (top). The membrane was then stripped and probed with the IL18BP antibody (bottom). (K) IL-18BP bioassay: IFN-\u03b3 production was measured in NK-92 cells after stimulation with recombinant human IL-12 (100 pg/ml), IL-18 (10 ng/ml), and/or concentrated supernatants (100 \u03bcg/ml of total protein) of COS7 cells transiently transfected with either empty vector or the constructs expressing indicated IL-18BP variants. Graph is presented on a logarithmic scale with base of 10. The data shown are means \u00b1 SEM of two independent experiments performed in duplicate using the supernatants shown in I and J. . Relative fluorescence and albumin levels were determined by normalization against the mean value for HepG2 cells cocultured with NK92 cells without pretreatment (NT), set to 100. A decrease in the fluorescence or in albumin levels indicates an increase in NK cell-induced hepatotoxicity. Data are means \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments performed in quadruplicate for each group (n.s., not significant, *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). (D) PBMCs isolated from two healthy individuals (donors 1 and 2) were pretreated with IL-18 and/or IL-18BP in the presence of IL-2 for 24 h and cultured with calcein-AM-stained HepG2 cells for 4 h. Relative fluorescence levels were determined by normalization against the mean value for HepG2 cells cocultured with PBMCs without IL-2 treatment, which was set to 100. Data are means \u00b1 SEM of two independent experiments performed in quadruplicate. (E) Representative images show immunofluorescence staining for HAV infection in HepG2 and Huh7.5 cells at 20\u00d7 magnification. Nucleus was stained with DAPI (blue). HAV-infected cells are in red. Scale bar represents 25 \u03bcm. Information related to the expression pattern, known function, and clinical significance of these six genes in humans were obtained from the NCBI Gene database. ",

Immuhistochemistry staining of liver tissue sections from a control individual, an unrelated patient with FVH due to HAV, and the deceased IL-18BP-deficient FVH patient reported in this study with the following markers: Hep Par-1, CD3\u03b5, CD4, CD8, Perforin, CD57, NKp46, CD20, CD68, CD163, and IL-18. Hep Par-1 staining of the IL-18BP-deficient patient's liver tissue section displayed a background staining of macrophages, with lower intensity than hepatocytes. The IL-18BP-deficient patient and the unrelated FVH patient displayed also some residual hepatocytes positive for CD163 staining.
