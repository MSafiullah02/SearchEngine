Supportive care & monitoring -Most patients will clear both infections successfully What is the diffi culty with a positive serological test for Lyme disease?

Will everyone in a crowd get it, if an infected person walks through? Fairly easily, but it usually requires close face-to-face or bodily fl uid contact Contact with contaminated items like bedding can spread the disease Only rarely spread via air in enclosed spaces Contagious small pox patients are also usually quite ill & not likely to be walking far!
