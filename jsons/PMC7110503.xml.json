The disease remains often subclinical, which may lead to difficulties in diagnosing those conditions accurately. Blood examination and serum chemistry evaluation are useful tools in screening hepatic pathology and monitoring response to treatment. Diagnostic imaging allows visualization of liver abnormalities, especially gallbladder and bile duct disease. Ultimately, histopathology is often required for definitive diagnosis and staging of the lesions. Various diseases have been reported: inflammatory, infectious and toxic hepatitis, and hepatic lipidosis. Less commonly, neoplasia or other pathology may be seen. After a summary of anatomy and physiology of the ferret liver, hepatic diseases known in ferret species are reviewed with their subsequent diagnostic procedures.",

Bile capillaries join to form interlobular ducts, then bile duct. The cystic duct joins the right, central, and left ducts to form the common bile duct. The pancreatic duct usually joins the common bile duct, entering the lumen of the duodenum at the duodenal papilla approximately 2.8 cm caudal to the cranial duodenal flexure.

In cats, cholangiohepatitis can be observed with a decrease of parenchymal echogenicity and increased visibility of portal vasculature. Chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis are characterized with a small or normal by diffuse hyperechogenicity with a small or normal-sized liver (Fig. 4\n).

In dogs, Helicobacter DNA has been detected in liver tissue affected with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In the same study, however, Helicobacter DNA was also detected in the control group; thus, statistical evidence of pathogenicity was not proved.41 Equally in humans, incidence of Helicobacter spp is slightly raising the risk of cholelithiasis and benign liver disease but pathogenicity remains difficult to establish.42\n",

Visualization of gas bubbles in ultrasound was diagnostic of emphysematous cholecystitis due to presence of gas-producing bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from bile culture. Escherichia coli and Clostridum perfringens, frequently isolated bacteria in dogs, have been seen in ferrets (Minh HUYNH, DVM, 2012, personal communication). Ultrasound-guided cholecystocenthesis can be recommended in order to submit a bile sample for bacteriology.
