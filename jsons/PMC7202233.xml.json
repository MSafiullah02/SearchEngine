Each day, an evolving lineage was allowed to form \u223c300 plaques (always between 150 and 600 plaques), where each plaque initiates from a single virus particle. Viral titers were thus measured in plaque\u2010forming units. After 24\u2010h incubation, plaques were harvested and filtered to obtain a bacteria\u2010free lysate containing the virus progeny for the lineage. To maintain the population bottleneck size of \u223c300 individual viruses, the lysate was subsequently diluted and plated again in the presence of na\u00efve (unevolved) bacteria. Use of na\u00efve bacteria that were freshly grown from frozen stock prevented evolution of bacterial resistance to phage, as well as any possibility for coevolution between bacteria and phage. The 24\u2010h propagation scheme was repeated for 30 consecutive days, to achieve 30 passages per virus lineage. As overnight plaque growth corresponds to approximately five generations of viral evolution, the populations experienced \u223c150 generations of experimental evolution (30 passages \u00d7 5 generations per passage).",

On the mixed\u2010host lawn ECC produced clear plaques, whereas a test phage produced turbid plaques because it could not infect P. syringae pv atrofaciens. In this way, the plaques appearing on the mixed\u2010host lawn after 24 h were used to estimate the true ratio of test phage to ECC in the initial mixture (R\n0) at the beginning of the fitness assay. A diluted sample of the initial mixture containing \u223c200 plaque\u2010forming virus particles total was also plated on P. pseudoalcaligenes ERA. After 24 h, the resulting \u223c200 plaques were harvested and filtered to obtain a bacteria\u2010free lysate containing the progeny of the two viruses. A diluted sample of the lysate was then plated on a mixed\u2010host lawn to estimate the ratio of test virus to ECC after 24 h of growth on ERA (R\n24). Thus, fitness (relative growth rate) was determined on ERA, but the relative ratio of viruses was tracked by platings on the mixed\u2010host lawns. Fitness (W) is the ratio of the two observed ratios: W=R\n24/R\n0 (Duffy et al. 2006). We used log W in all statistical analyses, because (1) this approach is preferred in microbial evolution experiments (Bennett et al. 1990; Chao et al. 1992; Burch and Chao 2000), and (2) log W exhibits homogeneous variance. All test viruses were competed six times versus ECC.

Thus, the mixture resulted in a multiplicity of infection of roughly five viruses per bacterium. Here, the vast majority of cells experience coinfection by multiple viruses, which allows for reassortment: the formation of hybrid genotypes containing a combination of the RNA segments present in the two coinfecting parent viruses (Turner and Chao 1998). (We note that true recombination [template switching between RNA segments] is rare or nonexistent in \u03c66, allowing each of the three RNA segments to be treated as a single locus [Mindich et al. 1976].) After 40\u2010min incubation to allow virus attachment to cells, a diluted sample of the mixture was plated to obtain a high\u2010titer lysate containing the viral progeny. We then identified progeny with the narrow host\u2010range phenotype (growth restricted to P. pseudoalcaligenes ERA), double or triple plaque\u2010purified single genotypes with both the broad and narrow host ranges, and sequenced the regions containing mutations to identify the hybrid genotypes.

We founded four replicate populations (E1\u2013E4) with a broad host\u2010range phage (\u03c66broad) that differs from the wild\u2010type (\u03c66wt) only by the mutation E8G in the host attachment gene P3 (Duffy et al. 2006). This mutation confers the ability to infect two host strains that do not permit infection of \u03c66wt, including the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes ERA (Table 1). Each of the populations founded by \u03c66broad was subjected to selection on the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes by plating the phage population on a lawn of the novel host, incubating for 24 h to allow individual phages to form plaques, harvesting progeny phages from \u223c300 of the resulting plaques, and plating these phages on a fresh lawn of the novel host. This cycle was repeated for 30 days, corresponding to \u223c150 virus generations. The presence of only a single host in the habitat ensured that selection was not acting directly on host range (i.e., host\u2010use specificity; the mechanism by which viruses achieve assortative mating). Rather, if host specificity evolved, it could only occur as an indirect consequence of selection for improved performance on the novel host.",

An additional mutation was found in \u03c66E1narrow, in the untranslated 3\u2032 region of the medium segment, but it was discounted as the cause of the change in host range because none of the 3\u2032 noncoding regions in \u03c66 are known to impact function (Mindich 2006). To narrow our focus, we first isolated a narrow host\u2010range genotype, \u03c66E1narrow (day 20), from the evolved population at day 20, when the narrow host\u2010range phenotype was starting to sweep through the population (Fig. 1). Sequencing only the regions corresponding to the nonsynonymous mutations acquired by the \u03c66E1narrow lineage, we determined that \u03c66E1narrow (day 20) differed from \u03c66E1broad by two of the three mutations: A13V in P8 and G247A in P3. Because these mutations existed on different genome segments, we used classic genetic crosses between \u03c66E1narrow (day 20) and \u03c66E1broad to generate genomes that contained these individual mutations, but were otherwise isogenic to \u03c66E1broad. In this manner, we confirmed that the P3:G247A mutation was the cause of the narrow host\u2010range phenotype. Addition of this mutation to the \u03c66E1broad genome recapitulated the narrow host\u2010range phenotype of \u03c66E1narrow, whereas addition of the P8:A13V mutation did not (Table 1).",

We measured the fitness effect of individual mutations that narrowed host range, using paired growth assays under culture conditions identical to the selection experiment on novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes. For each population, we measured the fitness of a genome with the mutation (\u03c66E1broad + P3:G247A, \u03c66E3narrow, or \u03c66E4narrow) relative to the appropriate broad host\u2010range genome without the mutation (\u03c66E1broad, \u03c66E3broad, or \u03c66E4broad). Both mutations in P3 (A31T and G247A) were tested against otherwise isogenic competitors, and both significantly improved fitness, that is, growth rate, on the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes (Fig. 3). Thus, in all three populations showing reduced host range (increased host specificity), the phenomenon was caused indirectly by a single mutation that conferred a selective advantage on the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes (increased host performance).",

Evidence strongly suggested that this single molecular change was solely responsible for the similarly narrowed host range experienced by these two independently evolving lineages. Thus, the result demonstrates the repeatability of adaptive evolution when phage \u03c66 undergoes selection while shifting from its original host onto the novel host P. pseudoalcaligenes, as well as the shared consequence of this improved performance for the unselected trait, host breadth. This parallel evolution, where multiple lineages \u201cfind\u201d common mutational solutions, is predicted to occur in experimental and natural populations when there are small numbers of beneficial mutations available (Orr 2005). Such observations are not uncommon in microbial evolution studies conducted under these population\u2010genetics conditions (e.g., Bull et al. 1997). Interestingly, our study showed that beneficial mutations other than A31T could lead to improved performance on the novel host, but that these changes either did not affect host range (in the case of population E2) or narrowed it even more dramatically (in lineage E1).",

            "text": "We designed our laboratory experiments in a manner that mimicked the process of host shifts occurring in nature. It is generally believed that viruses can progressively evolve by first infecting only a reservoir host, then infecting both a reservoir and novel host, and finally infecting only the novel host (e.g., Kuiken et al. 2006). Consistent with this idea, laboratory experiments suggest that viruses shift hosts by experiencing an intermediate broad\u2010host\u2010range genotype, rather than instantaneously shifting from one host range to another, nonoverlapping host range. Thus, the vast majority of identified host\u2010range mutations are shown to expand the host breadth of a virus, instead of causing an immediate host\u2010shift (e.g., Zarling et al. 1977; Aytay and Schulze 1991). Extensive evidence from animal, plant, and bacterial viruses shows that these broad host\u2010range viruses readily lose host range when allowed to adapt to a single host (e.g., reviewed in Fenner and Cairns 1959; Reddy and Black 1974; Marchette et al. 1990; Wichman et al. 1999; Crill et al. 2000; Ebert 2000). Therefore, our laboratory results showing two reproductively isolated phages (\u03c66wt and \u03c66E1narrow) bridged by a broad host\u2010range intermediate (\u03c66broad) encompass this complete progression. For this reason, our study may reflect how host shifts lead to reproductive isolation in natural virus populations.",

Such experiments suggest a causal relationship between the observed reductions in host range and the general role of host attachment proteins in virus adaptation to new hosts, both in the laboratory (e.g., phage \u03c6X174 [Crill et al. 2000], Vesicular Stomatitis Virus [Z\u00e1rate and Novella 2004], and SARS Coronavirus [Poon et al. 2005]) and in nature (e.g., Influenza Virus [Parrish and Kawaoka 2005], and Canine Parvovirus [Shackelton et al. 2005]). Because many viruses seem capable of changing host range via only one or two mutations (Baranowski et al. 2001; Rainey et al. 2003; Parrish and Kawaoka 2005; Duffy et al. 2006), it hints that other RNA viruses have the potential to evolve reproductive isolation through no\u2010gene mechanisms as rapidly as we observed in \u03c66.",

However, because reproductive isolation evolved via a no\u2010gene mechanism in which recombination cannot separate ecological adaptation from assortative mating, we would not expect to obtain a different outcome in the face of gene flow (i.e., in sympatry). In other words, our finding of reproductive isolation via a no\u2010gene mechanism suggests that viral populations could evolve reproductive isolation regardless of whether they were evolving in allopatry or sympatry. In reality, natural virus populations probably often evolve in parapatry. For example, a virus that enters a human host may persist and replicate in that host for tens, hundreds, or perhaps even thousands of generations before it is transmitted to the next human or nonhuman host (Fu 2001; Drummond et al. 2003; Wilson 2004). Although parapatry may facilitate the evolution of viral host races, as in phytophagous insects (Feder et al. 1998; Hawthorne and Via 2001), parapatry would nonetheless provide substantial opportunity for gene flow to influence the divergence of RNA virus populations.",

For instance, gene flow may allow antigenic recombination between ancestral and emerging viruses, aiding the emerging virus' ability to elude the novel host's immune defenses (Hay et al. 2001; Garcia\u2010Arenal and McDonald 2003). In this scenario, the evolution of reproductive isolation would eliminate a source of beneficial genetic variation for the emerging population. We suspect this consequence of reproductive isolation would not have a major impact on RNA virus disease emergence because the high mutation rate of RNA viruses (Drake 1993) ensures that genetic variation is rarely a limiting factor in adaptation.",

In this case, reproductive isolation that separates the gene pools of ancestral and emerging populations may hasten adaptation of the emerging virus to the novel host. Because the constant immigration of alleles that are maladapted to the novel host is not something that a high mutation rate can easily counter, the strongest consequence of reproductive isolation for emerging RNA viruses may be to stop gene flow from decreasing the rate of adaptation to the novel host. The rapid pace with which reproductive isolation evolved in our experiments suggests that gene flow is unlikely to slow the adaptation of emerging RNA viruses for very long.",
