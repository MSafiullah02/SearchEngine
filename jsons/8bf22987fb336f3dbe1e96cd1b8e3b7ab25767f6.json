Here, we have targeted the 3C protease of Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), a feco-orally transmitted virus of the family Picornaviridae, for identification of potential antivirals. The 3C protease is a viable drug target as it is required by HAV, as well as by other picornaviruses, for post-translational proteolysis of viral polyproteins and for inhibiting host innate immune pathways. Computational screening, followed by chemical synthesis and experimental validation resulted in identification of a few compounds which, at low micromolar concentrations, could inhibit HAV 3C activity. These compounds were further tested experimentally against the 3C protease of Human Rhinovirus, another member of the Picornaviridae family, with comparable results.

For enzymatic inhibition assays, a peptide (EDANS-GLRTQ*SFS-DABCYL), containing the 3C cleavage site [42] (marked by a star), and flanked by a fluorophore and a quencher, at its N-and C-terminal ends respectively, was utilized. Mutated 3C, containing the C172A/C24S modifications which have previously been shown to inhibit 3C activity [27, 41] , served as a negative control for the assays. HAV 3C cleaved the peptide immediately as shown in Fig. 3 , whereas the mutated 3C did not show any appreciable cleavage activity even after 10 min of incubation. Saturation binding experiments were carried out to determine the dissociation constant (K d ) of all nine compounds (Table 4 ). Substrate cleavage by 3C followed Michaelis-Menten model (Table 5) , and kinetic parameters were developed, so that the effect of the compounds on 3C activity could be examined under initial velocity conditions ( Table 6 ). The inhibition constant (K i ) ( Table 1) was calculated by least-squares fitting using GraphPad Prism 5, La Jolla, CA, USA.

All the three docking software show correlation of < 0.5 w.r.t K i values; however, the average protein-ligand score for the most stable part of complexes during their 100 ns simulation using binding free energy scoring algorithm of MMBAPPL showed a strong correlation of 0.82 w.r.t K i values. BAPPL is the scoring algorithm utilized in ParDOCK for calculating binding free energy of the protein-ligand complex, which when calculated over all the snapshots of protein-ligand complexes during the molecular dynamics simulations is known as MMBAPPL. The score calculates energies obtained for each snapshot during the simulations and provides an average binding free energy of the complex. The success of the methodology relies on the screening (with \u00c010 kcal\u00c1mol \u00c01 of binding free energy as threshold) as well as the overall binding affinity calculated over a period of stable molecular dynamics simulations using MMBAPPL. a For calculating the correlations, the compound 5 data were not considered due to its drift from the catalytic site of protease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 323, "end": 327, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 328, "end": 331, "text": "40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 332, "end": 335, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 565, "end": 569, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 800, "end": 804, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 805, "end": 808, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1923, "end": 1927, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1940, "end": 1944, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 194, "text": "(Fig. S5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 907, "end": 913, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1143, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1213, "text": "(Table 5)", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1367, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1412, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1790, "text": "(Table 7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1800, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Molecular dynamics simulation studies of compounds 1-9 with HAV 3C"}, {"text": "The inhibition data for compound 5, obtained from our fluorimetric enzymatic assays, fitted better into an allosteric sigmoidal model, rather than in the equation for competitive inhibition, with a high K i of 117.8 AE 22.3 lM.

These common residues can give rise to 10 hydrophobic contacts and 13 hydrogen bonding interactions (10 hydrogen bond donors and 3 hydrogen bond acceptors) with an ideal ligand.

In our computational study, the ionization state of His44 was kept as HID44, so that the Ne of HID44 can interact with Sc H of Cys172 via a hydrogen bond [27] , while all other histidines were kept in HIE state using AMBER14 force field [26, [55] [56] [57] .

These scores, when generated for each snapshot of molecular dynamics simulations, provide a better understanding of the inhibitory potential of a compound over time, based on the predicted binding free energies.

C172A and C24S modifications were introduced in 3C-pET-28b by site-directed mutagenesis as per standard protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Wild-type and mutated 3C-pET-28b constructs were transformed in Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells and protein expression was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at 25\u00b0C. After 1.5 h of expression, cells were pelleted, resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 8.0, and 300 mM NaCl and lysed through French press. The protein was purified through Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, dialyzed in a buffer containing 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 2.5 mM EDTA, and further subjected to size-exclusion chromatography in a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). Approximately, 12 mg of protein was obtained from 1 L bacterial culture.For all enzymatic assays, 0.1 lM HAV 3C in a 100 lL reaction buffer of 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl was used. HRV14 3C was also used at a concentration of 0.1 lM, in 100 lL of reaction buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl. Stocks of all compounds were made in DMSO and their working solutions were prepared in assay buffer. Fluorogenic substrate peptide stocks were dissolved in water. First, compounds were tested for inner filter effect at different concentrations by measuring their absorption spectra from 200 to 700 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). To determine the dissociation constant (K d ) of compounds, 3C was titrated with increasing concentrations of compounds, with readings taken at an excitation wavelength (k ex ) of 295 nm and emission wavelength (k em ) of 330 nm using a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Hopkinton, MA, USA). Every reading was taken after 30 s of addition of compound to 3C. A similar titration with increasing concentrations of DMSO was carried out as control to check whether it has any contribution to the experimentally observed fluorescence values. Further, 3C was titrated with the fluorogenic substrate peptide to assess the Michaelis-Menten kinetics and to obtain K m and V max values. Once the dissociation constants were obtained, the compounds were added to 3C at concentrations slightly lower than K d and incubated for 15 min. Subsequently, increasing concentrations of the fluorogenic peptide were added and readings were taken at k ex = 336 nm and k em = 472 nm.
