Zoonosis is a complex Greek word deriving from the words \u2018\u03b6\u03c9o\u03bd\u2019 (zoon), which means animal, and \u2018\u03bd\u00f3\u03c3o\u03b6\u2019 (nosos), which means disease. In broad terms, a zoonotic infection is one that can be transmitted by animals to humans. A definite clarification of the term though does not exist, and one may wonder whether we need one, apart from the broad characterization offered above. But a definition is needed, because it will allow for proper grouping of appropriate pathogens and direct understanding of their correlations and broader, non-medical parameters. A proper definition would further allow for functional targeting of the factors that allow for the continuing prevalence of zoonotic infections through public health strategies and adaptations of social, medical and veterinarian policies that affect the impact of zoonoses.",

The term \u2018anthroponoses\u2019 (from the Greek word \u2018\u03b1\u03bd\u03d1\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0o\u03b6\u2019, which stands for human) had been coined to characterize diseases whose source was an infectious human, and the term \u2018sapronoses\u2019 (from the ancient Greek word \u2018\u03c3\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u00f3\u03b6\u2019, which means putrescent or degradable) referred to diseases whose origin was an abiotic substrate [1]. Zoonoses were further characterized as anthropozoonoses, when transmitted from animals to humans, and zooanthroponoses when transmitted vice versa. The term \u2018amphixenoses\u2019 (the Greek words \u2018\u03b1\u03bc\u03d5\u00ee\u2019, which means bi-, and \u2018\u03b6\u2208\u03bdo\u00e7\u2019, which means host) was also limitedly used to describe zoonotic infections that are transmissible either way. All these sub-terms were subsequently abandoned by WHO expert committees. Our anthropocentric view of nature means that in general the term \u2018zoonoses\u2019 refers to disease transmissible to humans, while the inverse remain a subject localized to the interest of environmental specialists.",

On the other hand, the novel swine influenza A (H1N1) virus is also typically a zoonotic infection, transmitted from swine hosts to humans; however, the ensuing direct human to human transmission was the signifying characteristic of the pathogen and the major factor leading to the 2009 pandemic. Despite being strictly a zoonotic infection, sharing initially certain socio-political characteristics with other typical zoonotic viral infections regarding its birth and initial contact with humans, its spread dynamics and human morbidity potential are irrelevant to its zoonotic nature. The same could be said about HIV, the simian origin of which would allow for a zoonotic characterization, and SARS-CoV, which originated in horseshoe bats [2].",

            "text": "In a courageous attempt to classify existing human pathogens, Taylor et al. [7] demonstrated that the majority of these pathogens are zoonotic, comprising 61% of the total of 1415 species. Furthermore, they managed to demonstrate that the vast majority of emerging diseases are caused by a zoonotic pathogen, the percentage reaching 75%. Although the categorization as zoonotic for some of the pathogens by Taylor and colleagues may be doubtful (many being theoretically only zoonotic), and although some of the species implicated are of historical or isolated significance for human health, there still exists an enormous burden of zoonotic agents causing major human morbidity. As discussed in the reviews by Christou and Akritidis in the present issue of Clinical Microbiology and Infection (\u2018The global burden of bacterial and viral zoonotic infections\u2019 and \u2018Parasitic, fungal and prion zoonoses: an expanding universe of candidates for human disease\u2019, respectively), the global impact of zoonotic infections is far more significant than indicated by public health and eradication campaigns and scientific research. This underestimated burden is even more troublesome because it transcends the strict medical field, extending to the veterinarian and public health field, and reaching, as will be discussed later, issues of society, state, economy and regional and national and global politics of all sorts. To put it simply, millions of new cases of zoonotic infections are registered annually worldwide, often in clusters irrespective of the disease, with a major morbidity toll that may lapse to chronicity, and considerable mortality. One can anticipate the future to hold an enhanced morbidity burden of zoonotic infections: not only are we able to recognize them better through advanced diagnostics, but medical progress has also created a vast reservoir of potential candidates for infection; in particular, immunocompromized patients build up such a patient pool, developing a wide spectrum of opportunistic infections, many of which were previously considered harmless zoonotic agents, typical examples being human cryptosporidiosis, unknown 40 years ago, and toxoplasmosis or listeriosis in AIDS patients.",

            "text": "Zoonotic infection control is a complex issue. Control of human disease, either by eradication or through elimination, may prove futile due to the lack of (and the projected non-development of) efficient vaccines for most of the significant zoonotic pathogens. One can presume that control should be an issue of veterinarians, identifying and eliminating disease in animal hosts. This is not the case though, because numerous zoonotic agents are recognized in wildlife, which is out of veterinary jurisdiction. Even for pathogens that emerge from domestic animals though, control is often unattainable due to inadequate planning or inadequate implementation of relevant campaigns: taking into account that this is often the case in the industrialized world (again the example of brucellosis control in the European Union [12] can serve as an instructive case study), one can imagine how futile such a target is in developing countries with absent or poorly developed medical, veterinary and public health infrastructure. The latter countries are the ones which serve as vast zoonotic reservoirs though: zoonoses have been recognized as diseases of the poor, and this has obvious implications for the way they are confronted by science, health-related project funding bodies and politics. Again using brucellosis as an obvious example for the author (an experience though that could be generalized for numerous other zoonotic agents and various countries, industrialized or not, the US-Mexico border [13, 14] being a prime example), a minor outbreak (<10 cases) of foodborne brucellosis in a suburb of the capital, Athens, a few years ago, resulted in extensive media coverage; on the other hand, a rather extensive (more than 80 cases) subsequent outbreak in a rural island of northern Greece [15] went unnoticed by the media, despite exhibiting significant evidence of all sorts of policy misdemeanours (illegal animal importation, inadequate implication of preventive policies and subsequent testing, inadequate notification of preceding cases that should serve as an alarm, and so on). The fact that zoonotic control is a political issue though is a rather easy conclusion: the instructive story of a bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak and its enormous consequences for the economy not only of the affected country but also of numerous others, underlines how a peculiar and vaguely understood zoonotic agent can affect global politics. However, terming zoonoses control as a political issue is also a too broad term to start with: As discussed in the review by Cascio and colleagues in the present issue of Clinical Microbiology and Infection (The socio-ecology of zoonotic infections), approaching the evolution of zoonotic infections should ideally be an interdisciplinary task that should comprise an intelligent political approach with all sorts of medical, veterinarian, public health, animal biology/entomology/ornithology-related, environmental, ecological, evolutionist and socioeconomic parameters. Even if all these parameters are harmonized, one needs to be assured that the public will be receptive: a direct relationship of zoonotic disease prevalence with the health literacy of the public has been demonstrated for certain zoonoses, including brucellosis and rabies [16, 17]. In this vein, introducing novel control strategies and campaigns that may directly affect the economical status of livestock owners may result in opposition or unwillingness to co-operate by the public, thus cancelling any control effort at the beginning [18].",

We should further take into account that chronic, currently considered idiopathic, diseases may ultimately be attributed to a zoonotic agent: the typical example here is the constantly evaluated potential relationship between Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease [24]. Understanding the complexity of zoonotic infections, and tracing the aetiology of their resurgence back to their roots is far from the concept of surveillance/diagnosis/eradication and elimination campaigns. It is foremost a concept of understanding nature as an organic system within which humans serve as a non-integral part, as a part of a chain that can recycle its integrity by expelling humans.",
