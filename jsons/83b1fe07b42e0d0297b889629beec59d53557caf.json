About 6 d are required for a monoblast to develop into a pro-monocyte and then into a monocyte under the influence of colony stimulating factor(s). Monocytes enter the blood stream where they constitute a major phagocytic cellular component in the chicken's blood. The second developmental stage of blood monocytes is the macrophages, and they are present in a variety of the body's tissues. It takes about 3 d for blood monocytes, after their arrival into the bloodstream, to seed various tissues and organs. Macrophages are, therefore, tissue forms of blood monocytes. Tissue macrophages can be found in the lungs where they are called alveolar macrophages. Only about 30% of the alveolar macrophages that are present in the lungs have their direct derivation from blood monocytes; the other 70% of alveolar macrophages develop by cell division inside the lungs. On the other hand, almost 100% of Kupffer cells, the macrophages found in the liver, are derived directly from blood monocytes. Macrophages are also present in bones where they are called osteoblasts. They are present in the brain as microglia cells and in the connective tissues where they are called histiocytes. Some of our studies involving chicken bone marrow stem cell differentiation have shown that such cells are fully capable of differentiating into several types of cells lineages including macrophages ( Figure 1A , B, and C), even Therefore, I have not attempted to present an up-to-date review of literature on this topic. Rather, I have summarized some salient research accomplishments made by our research group over the years in the area of avian macrophage biology and function. at day of hatch or prior to hatching. When we compared broilers with White Leghorn layers for the ability of embryonic hemopoietic progenitors to differentiate into macrophage lineage cells, we found that starting with the same numbers of bone marrow stem cells, broilers produced significantly lower numbers of macrophage-type colonies than White Leghorn chickens. This difference may be one indication of why broiler type chickens are perceived as being a little more susceptible perinatally than are White Leghorn type chickens (Nicolas-Bolnet et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "In addition to developmental maturation, cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) lineage such as monocytes and macrophages also undergo functional maturation. In the murine system, resident macrophages isolated from the peritoneal cavity can be primed and activated in response to biological signals such as \u03b3interferon and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In chickens, however, there are no (or just a few) resident macrophages present in the abdominal cavity. Therefore, as a result of an active inflammatory response at a tissue site such as the abdominal cavity, monocytes can be recruited into the tissues (Qureshi et al., 1986; Qureshi and Dietert, 1995) . Macrophages can then be purified from the inflammatory abdominal exudate cells (AEC) by adherence to glass (coverslips) or plastic (Petri dish) surfaces. It has been shown that Sephadex-elicited macrophages are very phagocytic Abbreviation Key: AEC = abdominal exudate cells; CD14 = LPSbinding molecule; iNOS = inducible isoform nitric oxide synthase; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; MPS = mononuclear phagocytic system; NO = nitric oxide; NOS = nitric oxide synthase; TLR = toll-like receptor. for particulate antigens such sheep red blood cells or bacteria (Qureshi et al., 1986) . However, Sephadex-elicited macrophages are not capable of performing certain specialized effector functions such as tumor cell killing. Our studies have shown that one can drive Sephadexelicited macrophages towards tumoricidal pathways by providing biological signals such as bacterial LPS and lymphokines (Qureshi and Miller, 1991a) . Therefore, as with the murine macrophages, chicken macrophages could also be defined as undergoing at least three different stages of functional maturation, i.e., responsive, primed, and activated macrophages. There are studies in the literature describing the antigenic uptake/trapping function of spleen-and liver-sourced macrophages during embryonic development. Working with Sephadexelicited macrophages, we have shown that turkey poults are fully capable of responding to an inflammatory challenge received at day of hatch with the recruitment of blood monocytes into the challenged tissue. Sephadexelicited abdominal exudate macrophages collected at 3, 5, or 7 d of age are quite efficient in phagocytizing antibodycoated or uncoated antigen targets .",

In our experience, AEC collected between 30 to 40 h after a single injection of a 3% Sephadex suspension given as 1 cc/100 g BW, yields greater than 90% macrophages in the AEC ( Figure  2A ). In addition to the development of a method for the isolation of macrophages from live chickens, our laboratory has established a transformed macrophage chicken cell line (MQ-NCSU), which serves as a unique tool to examine various aspects of chicken macrophage biology and function in many laboratories throughout the world .",

For example, neutrophils, upon dying, release elastase or collagenase, which are chemotactic in nature. Furthermore, collagen, elastin, and fibrinogen are also chemotactic in nature. The chemotactic potential can easily be demonstrated by using chicken blood monocytes and incubating them in the presence of a synthetic bacterial signal peptide such as f-met-leu-phe, or with the supernatants from bacterial cultures. Using a chemotactic assay ( Figure 2C ), we have demonstrated that chicken blood monocytes are very active in responding to chemotactic signals, and that there are differences in the chemotactic potential of blood monocytes depending upon their genetic origin (Qureshi et al., 1988) .",

            "text": "Phagocytosis is perhaps the most evolutionary conserved function of the macrophage. Macrophages perform phagocytic functions via several different mechanisms. Most of the phagocytic functions for particulate antigens are mediated via specific receptors present on the surfaces of macrophage cells. These receptors are capable of binding specific targets for phagocytosis. For example, certain pattern recognition molecules present as receptors on the macrophage surface enhance the binding of bacteria with mannose and fructose by their correct spacing. Macrophages also have specific receptors for mannose, and because of this, certain bacterial or viral agents having mannose expressed on their outer surfaces will preferentially bind to the macrophage via those mannose receptors. Macrophages also have scavenger receptors. Scavenger receptors are utilized to internalize pathogens as well as old and dying red blood cells. There are other specialized receptors such as the Fc-receptor that are present on the surface of the macrophage that specifically target antigens that are coated with their antibody ( Figure  2D ). Also, an antigenic target that is coated with complement can be preferentially bound to the surface of the macrophage via the complement receptor. Additionally, there are receptors present on the surface of the macrophage that may not necessarily be directly involved in phagocytosis but which can mediate an activation signal for the LPS-binding receptors. The percentage of macrophages that are phagocytic is dependent upon the type of target being phagocytized. For example, in a typical phagocytosis assay, utilizing nonantibody coated SRBC, one would see approximately 20 to 40% of the adherent macrophage population capable of internalizing two to three sheep red blood cells per phagocytic macrophage. On the contrary, the percentage of phagocytic macrophages increases significantly to 70 to 95%, if the SRBC are coated with a specific antibody ( Figure 2B ). Furthermore, by utilizing opsonized SRBC, the presence of Fcreceptors can be demonstrated on the surface of chicken macrophages where antibody-coated SRBC are bound to the external surface of the macrophage in a typical rosette formation.",

Usually one macrophage is capable of internalizing several bacteria ( Figure 3B ), and some of our studies have shown that nearly 90% of internalized bacteria are killed by Sephadex-elicited macrophages in the first 15 min of internalization (Qureshi et al., 1986) . After the bacteria are brought into a phagosome, the fusion of the phagosome with a lysosome must occur so that the enzyme(s) present in the lysosome can degrade the internalized bacteria (Qureshi and Dietert, 1995) .

In vitro exposure of macrophages to \u03b21-3, 1-6 glucan induces proliferation greater than seen in sham-exposed macrophages.

Arginine is utilized as a substrate by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which catalyzes the biosynthesis of free radical nitric oxide (NO) as a byproduct of an oxidative reaction using the guanidino nitrogen group of L-arginine to make L-citruline. Nitric oxide is a highly reactive, low molecular weight, shortlived cytotoxic entity and is converted to nitrite and nitrate that are more stable products. We have shown that chicken macrophages express a 4.5-kb NOS in its inducible isoform (iNOS) when macrophages are exposed to bacterial LPS. Furthermore, iNOS is fully functional in utilizing arginine as quantitated by the presence of nitrite in macrophage culture supernatants as well as when iNOS activity was quantitated in macrophage cell-lysates Qureshi, 1997, 1998) .",

These differences in gene expression are not due to a differential post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism(s), but rather due to enhanced transcriptional activity in iNOS hyper-responder genotypes (Hussain and Qureshi, 1998) . Based on LPS-induced iNOS expression, lines of chicken have been identified as either hyper-or hypo-responders for iNOS Qureshi, 1997, 1998) . It was clear that these differences are genetically intrinsic and are not specific to the commonly used E. coli LPS, since iNOS hyper-and hypo-responsiveness of these strains was maintained regardless of the source of bacterial LPS used (Dil and Qureshi, 2002a) . Because LPS represents a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) for which there are unique recognition factors called Toll-like receptors (TLR), we hypothesized that the differential expression of iNOS in macrophages from various chicken genotypes may be due to the differential expression of the LPS-binding molecule CD14 or their signaling molecules, the TLRs. This hypothesis was proven from the findings that macrophages from iNOS hyper-responder genotypes express significantly higher inducible CD14 as well as TLR4 as compared with the hypo-responder genotypes (Dil and Qureshi, 2002a) . The fact that the CD14 and TLR4 are critical in LPS-induced iNOS expression by macrophages was proven in a subsequent study in which CD14 and TLR4 were blocked with appropriate antibodies which resulted in a significant reduction in iNOS expression and activity (Dil and Qureshi, 2002b) . The involvement of nuclear factor (B (NF(B) was also shown to be relevant in hyper-iNOS expression because the hyper-responder genotypes contained greater levels of DNA-bound NF\u03baB than the low-responder genotypes (Dil and Qureshi, 2002b) . Interestingly, interleukin-1 \u03b2 did not contribute to genetic-based differences in iNOS expression and activity in chicken macrophages (Dil and Qureshi, 2003) .",

            "text": "Chicken macrophages are susceptible to both environmental and toxicological insult. For example, macrophage viability and functions are adversely affected by mycotoxins such as aflatoxins (Figure 4 ) (Neldon-Ortiz and Qureshi, 1991), Fumonisin-B1 (Qureshi and Hagler, Jr., 1992) , trichothecenes (Kidd et al., 1995) , T-2 toxin (Kidd et al., 1997) , and others. Embryonic exposure of chicks to aflatoxin-B1 either through in ovo injection (Neldon-Ortiz and or maternal transfer of toxin metabolites to progeny chicks down regulates macrophage phagocytic function post-hatch. Examples of environmental stressors affecting macrophage functions include heat stress (Miller and Qureshi, 1992a,b,c) and exposure to microbes. While existing microbes change to escape the immune system, new mi-crobes evolve continuously. Recent isolation of new variants of E. coli from turkeys (Edens et al., 1997a,b) is a good example of microbial antigenic modulation. Macrophages do recognize such antigenic change by differential phagocytosis of variant strains of E. coli . The same is true for viruses, examples of which include new variants of astrovirus (Yu et al., 2000) and reovirus ARV-CU98 (Heggen-Peay et al., 2002a) isolated from cases of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome in turkeys. While macrophages may not allow infection or virus replication, the ARV-CU98 reovirus has been shown to induce functional alterations in the macrophage, such as the up-regulation of interleukin-1 mRNA, even without any signs of viral replication (Heggen-Peay et al., 2002b) . In fact, in situations where multifactorial infections overwhelm the immune system, such as in poult enteritis and mortality syndrome, macrophage-mediated cytokine-induced immune dysfunction may be a cause of some of the observed clinical pathophysiological signs in the affected poults .",
