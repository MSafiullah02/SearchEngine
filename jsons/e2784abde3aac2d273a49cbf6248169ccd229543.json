Up to March 6, 2020, there was a total of 98,129 cases in the world, and 3380 deaths were reported [7] . Although most of the cases and deaths occurred in China, the increasing trend of incidence and mortality in China seems to have stabilized. In contrast, a dramatic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has been reported in Europe, the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Iran since the end of February. Based on the earlier experience in Hubei, China [8] , the rapid escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases may lead to an insufficiency of healthcare resources and further result in poor outcome in patients. Therefore, we postulate that a similar association can be observed worldwide, and thus we conducted an analysis to find a possible association between the outcome of mortality and the case number of COVID-19.",

Thus, it can be expected that a large increase in the number of COVID-19 cases can cause a huge burden on healthcare resources and possible burn-out of healthcare staff.

It is reasonable that a rapid increase in the number of cases can facilitate the spread of COVID-19 and further result in even more cases. Secondly, higher level of healthcare performance was associated with higher incidence of COVID-19. This may be explained by the fact that countries with higher HCI or HAQI had better ability to detect COVID-19; thus, more cases may be identified. Finally, we found that DCI was positively correlated with mortality and that the significant association between DCI and mortality remained unchanged after adjustment of the level of healthcare performance -HCI or HCAI. Moreover, the four countries with the highest DCI -China, Iran, the Republic of Korea, and Italyhad more death per 1,000,000 people than other countries. In contrast, although we showed similar findings with those of Ji et al. [8] , in which a larger number of infections in the earlier China was associated with higher mortality. Our previous study also demonstrated that the incidence and mortality rates were correlated with DCI, especially in countries with local transmission [10] . However, the correlation and DCI observed in the present study was not as good as that in the earlier China study [8] but DCI was found to be more correlated with mortality than incidence.

            "text": "findings can be explained by the fact that in addition to the absolute number of patients (incidence), the rapidly increasing number of patients (high DCI) may cause huge consumption of medical resources and may lead to shortage of healthcare availability and poor patient outcome in this COVID-19 outbreak. However, whether DCI can be applied in other settings/countries or another epidemiological scenario needed more studies to validate our findings and investigate its usefulness.This study had several limitations. First, several confounding factors, such as the infection prevention and control strategy and the capacity of diagnostic tests can affect the incidence of COVID-19 in each country. These factors were not evaluated in this study. Second, the mortality of COVID-19 patients can be affected by the underlying condition of the patients, the composition of study population and the capacity of critical care such as the number of intensive care units, mechanical ventilators, and critical care providers. Although we tried to use HCI and HAQI to represent the quality of healthcare system, further comprehensive study incorporating these factors is needed.In conclusion, DCI could be a potential indicator positively correlated with the incidence and mortality of COVID-19. Reducing DCI through strict infection control measures can help slow the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and further improve outcome in COVID-19 patients.DeclarationsFunding: No",
