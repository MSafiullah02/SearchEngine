The positive electrostatic potential represents proton repulsion by atomic nuclei due to low electron density (blue shades). Similarly, the negative potential represents the proton attraction due to excess electron density (red shades).32, 33 The potential values are represented in varied colors and increase in the order red < orange < yellow < green < blue.
