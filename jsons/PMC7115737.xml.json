Disease severity can range from mild, common cold-like illness to severe, life-threatening respiratory tract infection. The burden of noninfluenza VRTIs is often more pronounced in individuals with chronic comorbidities or clinical risk factors. Moreover, it is estimated that 500 million noninfluenza VRTIs occur annually in the United States, resulting in combined direct and indirect costs of $40 billion.1\n",

With the advent of molecular detection and genotyping techniques, there has been a substantial increase in the recognition of several newly identified noninfluenza respiratory viruses involved in disease. These potential pathogens have included severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), adenovirus type 14 (Ad14), human rhinovirus species C (RV-C), and human bocaviruses. Diagnostic testing for these and other viruses is important because many of the signs and symptoms of infection overlap those of other viruses such as influenza, and would otherwise be ascribed to cases of influenza-like illness without an etiologic assessment.",

Ad14 ARD was first described in 1955 in Dutch military recruits, but had been rarely reported since until 2 major outbreaks at military training centers in the United States occurred in 2007.

RVs are now divided into 3 species based on phylogenetic analyses: 2 well-characterized species, A and B, and the novel RV-C species. Although newly described, there are indications that RV-C has been circulating for decades.10 It seems that RV-C went undetected for years because it does not propagate using traditional virus-isolation methods.9, 11, 12, 13 Historically, RVs have been classified according to serotype, which is based on phenotypic characteristics. However, variants of RV-C are not currently assigned to serotypes, as methods for their in vitro culture have not been successful to date and their cross-neutralization properties remain unknown. RV-A currently comprises 77 different serotypes and RV-B 30 types, and, based on genotypic relatedness, RV-C can be separated into at least 60 (geno)types.14 RVs are small, nonenveloped viruses of approximately 30 nm in diameter with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.1 kb, which belong to the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. The genome organization of all RVs consists of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a single open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein, and a 3\u2032 UTR before a polyadenylated tract (Fig. 2\n). RV-Cs are more genetically diverse than the other RV species, and the RV-C genome is the shortest among other reported RVs and human enteroviruses.9, 11 There are also several unique genetic elements that distinguish RV-C from the other species.9, 15\n",

Species B1 (3, 7, 16, 21, 50) are generally associated with respiratory disease, whereas members of species B2 (11, 14, 34, 35) tend to infect the genitourinary and/or respiratory tracts. Adenoviruses are transmitted by respiratory droplets and the fecal-oral route as well as by fomites. Military recruits are highly susceptible to adenovirus infections, including pneumonia and ARD likely attributable to crowding and numerous stressors.3 Ad14 was first described in 1955 during an outbreak of ARD at a military training facility in the Netherlands. Rare outbreaks were described in the 1950s and 1960s in Great Britain, Uzbekistan, and Czechoslovakia, but there were no further described cases or outbreaks caused by Ad14 until sporadic cases were described in United States military recruits in 2006.24 Outbreaks of Ad14 occurred in the United States at 3 military training facilities in 2007. In the landmark outbreak in San Antonio, approximately 550 trainees were infected with Ad14, although not all individuals had severe disease.25 Subsequently, Ad14 was detected in 5 additional military bases and in civilians in Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New York, and California.26, 27, 28 From March to June 2007, 140 Ad14 cases were confirmed in 4 states, including 38% hospitalizations (17% intensive care) and 5% mortality.26 The sequences of the Ad14 viruses from these outbreaks were identical but different from the 1955 virus from the Netherlands, suggesting the emergence of a new variant.26 It is likely that the cessation of adenovirus vaccination efforts in the US Military in 1999 likely contributed to the reemergence of adenovirus-associated ARD on military bases, including Ad14-associated disease.",

RV-C has been detected in patients with acute illness of upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract,9, 11, 12, 71, 72 wheezing,9, 37, 39, 45, 73 bronchiolitis,11, 74, 75 asthma exacerbations,9, 13, 45, 72, 76, 77 exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia,9, 30, 32, 74, 78, 79, 80 common cold and flu-like illness,38 pharyngitis74 and croup-like cough,15 rhinitis, nasal congestion, bronchitis, and dyspnea.74 Nonrespiratory symptoms in RV-C\u2013positive patients include fever, febrile convulsion,15 otitis media,81 pericarditis,80 poor appetite, and apparent life-threatening events.75 Data suggest that RV-Cs are more frequently detected in older children than are RV-As.13, 72, 82 RV-C has been detected in blood samples of children with severe respiratory infection, and viremia was associated with a significantly higher concentration of virus in the nasopharynx.83, 84 In fact, higher RV-C viral loads in respiratory specimens have been associated with severe upper and lower respiratory tract disease, and the median peak viral load in patients with RV-C infection has been shown to be higher than in those patients with RV-A or RV-B infection.40, 85 Stool specimens have also revealed the presence of RV-C and other RV species with viral loads comparable with those of enteroviruses, sometimes along with other gastrointestinal pathogens.86, 87, 88 The clinical significance of RVs in fecal samples remains unclear. In patients hospitalized with disseminated disease, RV-C was detected in respiratory, stool, pericardial effusion, urine, and plasma specimens.78, 80 Health care\u2013associated outbreaks of respiratory infections have been attributed to RV-C in a neonatal intensive care unit89 and a long-term care facility.90\n",

However, viral antigen has been localized to the ciliated bronchial epithelium and unciliated cells of terminal bronchi.

Replication in the respiratory epithelium leads to cell death in the host; however, it is not clear whether the cytopathic effect of adenovirus is due to viral pathogenesis or the host immune response.123 Adenoviruses also evade the host immune response by inhibiting interferon activity, apoptosis, and expression of major histocompatibility complex class I.123 These immunomodulatory functions may also play a role in the development of latency or persistence for some of the adenovirus species (namely, species C).",

However, later experiments determined that there were minimal differences in replication capacities at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C for several RVs.124 RVs have been shown to replicate in the nasal epithelium and nasopharynx and, unlike influenza virus and RSV, do not cause destructive cytopathology of the upper respiratory tract. In the lower respiratory tract, RVs have been shown to cause changes in both interstitial and alveolar processes with inflammatory findings. RV-B and most RV-A variants use the intracellular adhesion molecule 1 receptor for cell entry, whereas a subset of RV-A types use the low-density lipoprotein receptor. The receptor used by RV-C types is currently unknown. The predicted capsid structure of RV-C differs significantly from those of RV-A and RV-B, particularly in regions relating to receptor and antiviral binding footprints.11, 15 RV-Cs do not grow in typical cell-culture lines but have recently been grown in vitro using sinus mucosal tissue or fully differentiated human airway epithelial cells, and the virus appears to use a cellular receptor distinct from that of RV-A and RV-B.125, 126 In general, shedding of RV-C does not extend beyond 3 weeks after resolution of symptoms,45, 82 but immunocompromised patients may shed virus for extended periods.40\n",

Although relatively highly conserved in comparison with RV coding regions, sequence variation in the 5\u2032 UTR between different RV types creates difficulties in designing primer pairs that can satisfactorily detect all RV types and species.140 Specific identification of RVs using RT-PCR targeting the 5\u2032 UTR is also complicated by the fact that enterovirus detection assays often cross-react with RVs because of sequence similarity in this region.87 The high sensitivity of PCR can also be a limitation because the presence of viral nucleic acid in respiratory secretions of a patient with respiratory symptoms does not necessarily connote causality. RV-C, and other RVs, have been identified by RT-PCR in respiratory specimens from a high proportion of asymptomatic individuals,55 possibly leading to an overestimation of the disease burden. However, one study that included asymptomatic controls identified RV-C more often in sick than in well patients, with RVs detected in only 3 of 93 asymptomatic individuals.38 There is also some evidence that RV-C may interfere with infection by other viruses.71, 82 Co-detections of multiple viruses in respiratory infections have been seen more frequently as a result of the increased availability of multiplex and microarray detection assays.141 The high co-detection rate also adds to the difficulty of differentiating RV-C as a true pathogen. Some reports have indicated a correlation between higher viral loads and symptomatic disease.85, 142 However, quantitative RT-PCR testing is not readily available, and there is no standard for the quantification of all RV types. In general, accurate viral load testing of respiratory specimens can be challenging because of the various types of samples, collection techniques, and patient populations assessed.143 Identification of the infecting species or serotype is of importance diagnostically for the detection of mixed infections or a reinfection with different RV serotypes, as well as in broader clinical investigations of the relationship between a serotype or species with disease severity and in epidemiologic investigations of the circulation and turnover of RVs.",

However, as HBoV1 can be shed in respiratory secretions for weeks to months following primary infection or detected in asymptomatic individuals, detection of anti-HBoV1 antibodies in serum in addition to HBoV1 DNA detection can differentiate primary infection from long-term postinfectious shedding.68 Serologic methods have been developed to detect HBoV1-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies using recombinant capsid antigens or virus-like particles.48, 51, 52, 53, 144 It is known that antibodies to HBoV2-4 can cross-react with HBoV1 antigens, so reliable detection of an HBoV1-specific response may best be achieved by depletion of reactive antibodies to the other genotypes.50 An IgG-avidity enzyme immunoassay has been used to distinguish between acute and past infections, or between primary and secondary infections,53 although the same antigenic cross-reactions may occur. Detection of HBoV1 DNA in blood is more closely associated with symptoms than are positive respiratory samples alone,62, 106 and higher viral loads in respiratory specimens correlate with acute infections, fewer coinfections, and increased disease severity.48, 51, 52, 54, 56, 59, 101, 108 Therefore, acute HBoV1 infection can more accurately be made by detection of DNA in serum or high viral load (>104 HBoV1 copies/mL) in respiratory samples along with detection of IgM antibodies or an increase in IgG response in paired serum samples.48 To overcome the ambiguity and limitations of qualitative HBoV1 DNA detection in respiratory specimens, it has also been shown that the presence of HBoV1 mRNA (ie, actively transcribing virus) is more likely to indicate a causative role of the virus in acute respiratory tract disease.104, 105\n",

Interferon-\u03b12b in combination with ribavirin has been shown to reduce viral replication, moderate host immunologic response, and improve outcomes in rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV.145 In addition, in vitro data have demonstrated that ribavirin, interferon-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b2, and mycophenolic acid have activity against MERS-CoV.22 However, many of these drugs are nephrotoxic and may not be an appropriate choice for patients infected with MERS-CoV, which can also cause acute renal failure.",

Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, has broad antiviral properties, but clinical data on its efficacy are conflicting. Owing to the paucity of clinical efficacy data and side effects of treatment, off-label use of either drug for adenovirus treatment is generally reserved for disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients. Treatment of ARD in immunocompetent patients is generally only supportive in nature. A live, attenuated vaccine for Ad4 and Ad7 was approved in 2011 for use in military recruits aged 17 to 50 years entering basic training, which may provide some cross-protection against other adenovirus serotypes.",

To date the MERS epidemic is localized to the Middle East. However, MERS-CoV is the second CoV to emerge as a major human respiratory pathogen in the last 10 years. Further studies are needed to ascertain the full scope of disease and epidemiologic risk factors. Research aimed at refining the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV will be important in informing potential chemotherapy and interventional strategies. Although much was learned through the SARS epidemic, MERS-CoV belongs to a different lineage and appears to be more pathogenic. Surveillance efforts will need to continue to identify novel coronaviruses in bats and other potential hosts. Early detection of novel viruses, including coronaviruses, is an important strategy in limiting the spread of newly emerging viruses.",

Mild respiratory infections attributable to Ad14 may go undiagnosed, because of either lack of testing altogether or lack of type-specific testing for Ad14.

RV-C has been detected sometimes as a passenger and sometimes as a pathogen in acute respiratory tract disease; with monoinfection associated with high rates of morbidity. The pathogenic role of HBoV1 has been challenged, but diagnosis of acute infection using a combination of methods, including PCR of blood, quantitative PCR or detection of mRNA in respiratory secretions, and serology, has demonstrated that HBoV1 is responsible for a significant amount of respiratory tract disease in young children.
