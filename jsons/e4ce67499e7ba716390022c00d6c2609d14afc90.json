            "text": "Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) belongs to the species Enterovirus D within the Enterovirus genus. The biological properties of acid lability and a lower optimum growth temperature suggest that EV-D68 is similar to human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and is a respiratory tract pathogen. 1,2 As a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, EV-D68 genome contains a single open reading frame coding for a polyprotein, which is ultimately cleaved into four viral capsid proteins VP1-VP4 and seven non-structural proteins 2A-2C, 3A-3D by its proteases 2A and 3C. 3 VP1, VP2 and VP3 harbor the epitopes for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). 4 EV-D68 has been rarely detected since its first identification in 1962. 2 Based on the enterovirus surveillance data, only 36 cases were identified from 1970 to 2005 in the USA. 5 However, EV-D68 infection in patients with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) increased markedly in recent years worldwide possibly due to the viral genome variation. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Particularly, EV-D68 infections spread widely in 2014 in the United States causing outbreaks in most states. More than 1000 cases were reported during the epidemic. 13 In addition to respiratory illness, EV-D68 infection is also associated with neurological complications in the USA. 14 This has raised a public health concern. To date, no specific drugs and vaccines specifically targeting EV-D68 are available.",

            "text": "The reason for this observation is unclear. Besides viral factors, herd immunity, particularly the pre-existing NAbs in a population, may influence the spread of a virus. 20 As an imprint of the immunoresponse, NAbs in specific populations can not only trace the history of infection but also predict the susceptibility to a certain pathogen. 21 Because EV infections are usually asymptomatic or mild, 22 the data obtained from RTI patients seeking medical services could grossly underestimate the actual incidence and prevalence. To reveal an accurate epidemiological picture of an emerging virus infection, serological investigations based on NAb detection in the general population are therefore of particular importance to assess the prevalence and the transmission potential of EV-D68 for taking public measures to prevent this emerging epidemic. 22 Circulating EV-D68 strains can be divided into three clades: clades A-C. 8 Based on phylogenetic analysis, from August 2006 to August 2011, strains of clade A were predominant (90.9%) and clade B strains emerged in October 2011 in China. 19 In this study, we isolated an EV-D68 strain in China of clade A and set up microneutralization assays (MNAs) using sera collected before 2011 to reveal an accurate epidemiological picture of this emerging infection in Beijing, China.",

We isolated an EV-D68 strain from the nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) of an EV-D68-positive, 32-month-old male patient with pneumonia. This patient displayed a 2-day long cough, fever (the highest temperature: 38.2\u00b0C), sneezing and runny nose. The NPAs were first inoculated into a monolayer of H1-HeLa cells (ATCC CRL-1958). After 1 h adsorption at 33\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere, the NPAs were removed and the treated H1-HeLa cells were further incubated at 33\u00b0C in DMEM medium supplemented with 2% bovine fetal serum. The cultures were held for five to seven days and examined periodically for viral cytopathic effects (CPEs). 27 The negative cultures in the first passage were passed blindly to new cell cultures and examined for CPE. When CPE appeared, the isolate was first identified by negative-staining electron microscopy and characterized by MNAs using horse EV-D68 (Fermon) antiserum and a standard pool of EV typing antisera (RIVM, The Netherlands), then by western blot analysis using a specific antibody of VP1 28 and complete genome sequencing. The isolated virus was designated as EV-D68/Beijing/2008/01. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that EV-D68/Beijing/2008/01 belong to clade A.",
