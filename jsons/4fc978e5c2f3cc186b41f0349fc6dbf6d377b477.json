The ratio of the number of fatalities to the number of cases (case fatality ratio, CFR) recorded in Italy was surprisingly high and increased in the month of March. The older mean age of population, the changes in testing policy, and the methodological computation of CFR were previously reported as possible explanations for the incremental trend of CFR, a parameter theoretically expected to be constant. In this brief report, the official data provided by the Italian Ministry of Health were analyzed using fitting models and the linear fit method approach. This last methodology allowed us to reach two findings. The trend of the number of deaths followed a 1-3-day delay of positive cases. This delay was not compatible with a biological course of Covid-19 but was compatible with a health management explanation. The second finding is that the Italian number of deaths did not increase linearly with the number of positive cases, but their relationship could be modeled by a second-order polynomial function. The high number of positive cases might have a direct and an indirect effect on the number of deaths, the latter being related to the overwhelmed bed capacity of intensive care units.",

Some models have been based on an exponential curve for fitting the number of infected cases and deaths. Although mass media reported this initial exponential trend, it was conceivable to expect a deviation from that-rather than a plateau-followed by a progressive decrement, according to a bell-shaped curve (5) . A recent study based on data recorded up to the 8th of March hypothesized for Italy a trend similar to that observed in the Hubei Province in China, and it predicted a peak of cases at around the 10th of April (5). Anderson et al. (3) have developed an illustrative simulation of the transmission model of Covid-19, showing that social distancing could flatten the curve of positive case frequency, retarding and reducing the peak of the curve estimation in case of no social restrictions (3) . This theoretical modeling, reported by many mass media, suggested that a delay in contagions may reduce the number of deaths. This hypothesis was based on the idea that the number of beds in intensive care units (ICUs) could be sufficient only for a flattened curve of positive case frequency. Otherwise, if the number of severely affected patients exceeded that of beds in ICUs, the number of deaths could dramatically increase.",

Updated with the new data from the 29th of March, the Italian CFR exceeded the 10%. In a comparison report, a possible explanation was provided by the higher mean age of the Italian population compared with the Chinese one (7) . But this may be only a partial explain of the difference in the case fatality rate of Covid-19 in Italy with respect to China. An older population, such as the Italian one, may suffer from comorbidities, which increase the risk of death and hence the CFR (7). However, the Italian CFR has been higher than the Chinese one even after being corrected for age: in patients older than 80 years, CFR was 20.8% in Italy, and 14.8% in China (7) . Furthermore, the mean older age of people did not explain the incremental trend for CFR within the Italian population during the month of March.",

In the early phase of the epidemic, Italy carried out an extensive testing strategy by collecting swabs of both symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts of the infected patients, as was done in China. Then, the Italian Ministry of Health issued more stringent testing policies, prioritizing tests for patients with severe clinical symptoms who required hospitalization. This could have caused an increase in the computed value of CFR for the underestimation of the number of the asymptomatic or mildly affected patients for whom the tests were often not administered. It means that, in Italy more than in other countries, the full denominator of CFR remains unknown because asymptomatic cases or patients with mild symptoms might not be tested and hence will not be identified.",

These possibilities have led to the different theoretical scenarios depicted in Figure 1 . The CFR computed day by day could be high due to the need to take into account a biological delay of about 14 days between deaths and the recorded number of positive cases (8) or for the insufficient number of beds into ICUs. In the former case, there is a statistical problem, whereas, in the latter case, the health policy of other countries should take into account the Italian lesson for Covid-19. The aim of this study was to provide a deeper insight into the Italian CFR, testing the hypothesis that the number of deaths increased more than linearly with the number of positive cases. ",

The number of dead patients increased with the increment of infected patients (left panel). As clearly shown by the data, this increment has a second-order polynomial trend more than the expected linear one. When the CFR was computed (right panel of Figure 3) , an initial quite constant low value of CFR was observed, and it was followed by a progressive increment. In fact, in the first 9 days of data collection, the Italian CFR was roughly constant and lower than 3.5%. It then started to increase. The linear increment computed using the LFM showed that R 2 = 0.977. The model, based on a theoretical biological delay of 14 days in the computation of deaths, showed a lower value R 2 = 0.916. Furthermore, this model had a concavity opposite to that revealed by data. Conversely, in this phase, a bell-shaped increment related to the overwhelmed ICUs showed that R 2 = 0.980 in fitting the data. This last model coincided with a double bell-shape model with a delay of only 1 day between positive tests and deaths.",

Our results indirectly suggested that the Italian interventions, mainly based on the social distancing, have been effective in reducing the speed of contagions, as occurred in China. These restrictions seemed to reduce the increment of infected patients (often incorrectly reported as an exponential growth), preventing the intensive care units in the rest of Italy from being overwhelmed as occurred in Lombardy (4).",

Some authors have suggested that it could be due to the change in testing policy (7), but the increasing trend occurred even after this change. Other authors have suggested a correction in CFR computation for taking into account the time of incubation and worsening (8) , but it seemed to fail in modeling the Italian data. In fact, our results, obtained with different data analysis, seemed to show a delay ranging from 1-3 days between the curve of positive cases and that of deaths.

Direct and indirect effects of a wide contagion should be taken into account. The analysis of the evolution of the Italian CFR trend could be of help to further develop a suitable health policy in other countries. For example, in further studies, it could be important to assess the complementary value of CFR, which is related to recovered patients. There could be an important percentage of them needing rehabilitation of motor and respiratory functions. Some of these patients may not be able to wait for the end of emergency, but the health policy should face the problem of rehabilitation with a respect for safety. Even unaffected older people may have motor deficits related to the long period spent at home. Another aspect could be the psychological effects of Covid-19 in recovered patients, including the fear of being infected or the psychological effects of social distancing in uninfected people (12) .",
