In October 2005 and May 2006, the female gave birth to 2 cubs each delivery, which 3\u20134 weeks later showed signs of enteritis and died. In October 2006, she gave birth to a single cub, which died of severe hemorrhagic enteritis at 4 weeks of age. The cub exhibited anorexia, depression, and mild dehydration, but it was not moved away from the mother for ethologic and management reasons. In the subsequent days, the cub\u2019s general condition appeared to worsen; anorexia and more marked depression were reported by the animal caretakers. Therefore, on day 3 after illness onset, the cub was taken to the zoo\u2019s animal hospital. Examination showed a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C, hemorrhagic enteritis, tenesmus, and deep sensorial depression. Hydration and antimicrobial therapy were immediately started, but after 24 hours the animal was agonal and hypothermic and was therefore euthanized. At necropsy, severe hemorrhagic enteritis, hemorrhage in the intestinal lymph nodes, and marked dehydration were observed. Histologic examination showed marked alteration of the intestinal mucosa: erosions, villi depletion, and hemorrhagic infiltration.",

Calicivirus was identified in the intestinal content by using a broadly reactive primer pair, p289-p290, targeted to highly conserved motives of the RdRp region of the polymerase complex (5), but unexpectedly, the strain could not be characterized as FCV by using multiple sets of primers specific for the FCV capsid gene. In addition, the sample was positive for the norovirus (NoV)-specific primer pair JV12Y-JV13I (6).",

To determine the sequence and genome organization of the novel calicivirus, a 3.4-kb region at the 3\u2032 end of the genome was amplified by RT-PCR as described by Wang et al. (7). The sequence of the 3\u2032 end of open reading frame (ORF)1, the full-length ORF2, ORF3, and the noncoding region through the poly-A tail was determined (GenBank accession no. EF450827). A 14-nt overlap was present in the ORF1\u2013ORF2 junction region, as it is in most human and animal NoVs. The ORF2 was 1,737 nt long and contained an ORF encoding a capsid protein with a predicted size of 578 aa. By BLAST and FASTA analysis, the highest sequence match was found to genogroup IV NoVs (69.3\u201370.1% aa identity), and identity to non-GIV NoVs was \u226452.6% aa. A total of 23 aa insertions, scattered throughout the P2 domain, were present in the capsid protein of the lion NoV when compared with human genogroup IV NoVs. A 1-nt overlap was found between ORF2 and ORF3, and a 106-nt long nontranslated region was found between ORF3 and the poly-A tail. ORF3 was 765 nt long and encoded for a 254-aa polypeptide. The nucleotide identity plot of the genome of the lion NoV (from the 3\u2032 end of ORF1 to the poly-A tail) was compared with the human genogroup IV.1 NoV, Fort Lauderdale/560/98/US (AF414426) (Figure 1). A phylogenic tree was constructed by using the capsid protein of a selection of human and animal NoVs of the various NoV genogroups (I to V) (7,8). In the tree (Figure 2), the lion calicivirus strain was grouped with genogroup IV human NoVs.",

Human NoVs are classified into genogroups I, II, and IV. In addition, NoVs classified in genogroups II and III have been detected in pigs and cows (7,11,12), and NoVs proposed as genogroup V have been detected in mice (13) (Table).

A nucleotide identity plot of the genome of the lion NoV (from the 3\u2032 end of open reading frame [ORF] 1 to the poly-A tail) was compared with the human genogroup IV.1 NoV, Fort Lauderdale/560/98/US (AF414426). The sequences were analyzed with Simplot software (http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/scroftware/simplot) by using a window size of 200 and step size of 20 with gap strip off and J-C correction on. The ORF1\u2013ORF2 junction region is shown with the starting and stopping codons ATG and TGA underlined. The highly conserved domain S and the highly variable domains P1 and P2 of the capsid protein are also indicated.",

The tree was constructed by using a selection of norovirus (NoV) strains representative of genogroups (GG) I to V. Phylogenetic reconstruction was carried out with the p-distance correction and the neighbor-joining method, supported with bootstrapping >1,000 replications. Distance analysis and phylogenetic inference were carried out using the Mega 3.0 software package (www.megasoftware.net). Strain classification follows the outlines of Wang et al. (7) and Zheng et al. (8); strain designation follows the outlines of Green et al. (9).
