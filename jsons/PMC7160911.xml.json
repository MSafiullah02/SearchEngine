It is related to extraordinarily ability of spike\nglycoprotein to bind to host receptor with much higher affinity as compared\nto related SARS-CoV virus. Lower thermostability of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\nhas also been suggested as a factor contributing to its high\ninfectivity.1 Although SARS-CoV-2 testing is\ncurrently very efficient, public health care systems do not have the\ncapacity to test all the citizens. Thus, the identification of infected but\nasymptomatic people should be one of the priorities and this should be done\nas early as possible. Currently, assays that are based on real-time RT-PCR\ntechnique are recommended for early detection of the virus. Theoretically,\nprocedures based on RT-PCR are able to detect even a small number of viral\nRNA particles in biological samples. However, in practice, due to several\ntechnical factors, there must be much more viral load in the biological\nmaterial collected to achieve a reliable diagnosis. Typically nasal and\npharyngeal swabs as well as sputum are used as the starting biological\nmaterial for SARS-CoV-2 testing. It is assumed that this strategy is very\nefficient in diagnosing infected individuals 5\u20137 days after onset of\nsymptoms. Unfortunately, it is less efficient in detecting SARS-CoV-2 within\n1\u20134 days after symptoms and in asymptomatic individuals. Therefore,\nother types of biological samples should be identified to detect SARS-CoV-2\nmore efficiently about the time of infection.",

The nasal cavity contains three main types\nof mucosa: squamous, respiratory, and olfactory epithelium (Figure 1). Importantly, all these cells are\neasily accessible for collection by medical staff. According to some gene\nexpression data deposited in databases such as GEO and MGI, respiratory\nepithelial cells (RECs) express both of the SARS-CoV-2 human proteins\nrequired for host cell entry, namely, ACE2 and TRMPSS2 transmembrane\nproteases1,2 (Table 1).\nOn the other hand, recent single cell RNaseq studies in humans showed only\nTMPRSS2 expression in RECs without detecting ACE2.3 Other\nRNaseq studies showed rather low levels of ACE2 in RECs.4\nHowever, according to the mouse atlas, in embryonic RECs, ACE2 expression\nwas clearly shown by in situ hybridization but TMPRSS2 expression was not\nexamined by this approach. Taken together, current data suggest that RECs\npresent in the nasal cavity express rather low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2\nproteins as compared to epithelial cells located at lower parts of the human\nrespiratory pathway. However, it should be emphasized that the expression\ndata in RECs are clearly incomplete and require further detailed\nexamination.

            "text": "Another suitable source of biological samples for early SARS-CoV-2 detection is\nthe olfactory epithelium (OE), which is easily accessible within the nasal\ncavity (Figure 1). Recent reports\nindicate that total anosmia or partial loss of the sense of smell are early\nmarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This phenomenon may be caused by different\nand yet unidentified factors, e.g., \u201ccytokine storm\u201d initiated\nin some patients or direct damage of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs)\nlocated in the olfactory epithelium (Figure 2). The latter possibility is particularly\nlikely due to the fact that cells located in the OE express both protein\nreceptors required for effiecient SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Several\ndata sets deposited in gene expression databases show relatively high\nexpression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human and murine olfactory mucosa\n(Table 1). In mammals, OE is\na continuously regenerating multilayer structure containing both neuronal\nand non-neuronal cells (Figure 2).\nThe key question is whether ACE2 and TRMPSS2 expression in the OE is\nneuronal or non-neuronal or whether it occurs in both cell types. Neuronal\nexpression of host receptors will likely facilitate SARS-CoV-2 brain\ninfection through the uptake into ciliated dendrites/soma and subsequent\nanterograde axonal transport along the olfactory nerve. Non-neuronal\nexpression of ACE2/TRMPSS2 may possibly establish nasal cavity OE as a virus\nreservoir. Three major RNaseq transcriptome studies conducted in human and\nmurine OE consistently suggest non-neuronal expression of\nACE2.4\u22126 Hence, ACE2 expression is not clearly detected in\nmature ORNs, which are the only OE neurons connected to the brain.\nExpression of TMPRS2 seems to be higher compared to that of ACE2 and takes\nplace likely in both neuronal and non-neuronal OE\ncells.5,6 One state-of-the-art RNaseq study showed\nintriguingly mosaic TMPRSS2 expression which occurs only in subpopulation of\nmature ORNs, even though the majority of other genes were more evenly\nexpressed in these neurons.6 It suggests that some\nolfactory neurons in the OE may be more vulnerable for viral infection than\nother morphologically similar ORNs. Moreover, expression of murine ACE2 and\nTMPRSS2 evaluated by microarrays has a tendency to increase with age (Table 2). If it is true in humans,\nthen in elderly people the OE may be more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2\naccumulation. However, it should be remembered that although ACE2 is a\nmandatory factor for viral entry into the cell, TMPRSS2 can probably be\nreplaced by other proteases from this family such as TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11A,\n11D, and 11E1. Of these proteases, only TMPRSS4 is also present in the OE,\nlikely in immature neurons and in non-neuronal cells.5,6",

This may\nadditionally suggest that murine ORNs express endogenous TMPRSS2, because\nboth proteins are required for efficient infection. Intriguingly, there was\nan approximately 60 h delay from the time of nasal infection until SAR-CoV\nvirus detection in the olfactory bulb. During that time the virus likely\nreplicated and accumulated in different OE cells, because its subsequent\ntransport to further parts of the brain required a relatively short time of\nan additional 12\u201320 h.7 The results from\ntransgenic hACE2 mice indicate that SARS-CoV probably uses\ntransneuronal/transsynaptic routes employing axonal transport in the brain\nand this can also be true for SARS-CoV-2. It is known for other viruses,\ne.g., rabies virus, that they can hijack existing vesicular axonal transport\nmachineries to spread within the brain. There is very recent evidence that\nSARS-CoV-2 enters early and late endosomal compartments in non-neuronal\ncells; thus, it may possibly be directed to the vesicular axonal pathway in\nneurons.1 However, it should be remembered that the\nhACE2 mouse is an overexpressor model with expression of human ACE2\ncontrolled by human keratin K18 promoter. For this reason, alternative and\nmore physiological knock-in models for SARS-CoV-2 studies in the nervous\nsystem would be desirable. Alternatively to the olfactory axonal route,\nSARS-CoV-2 may pass from non-neuronal OE cells directly to cerebrospinal\nfluid surrounding olfactory nerve bundles, located near the cribriform\nplate. Once in cerebrospinal fluid, the virus could reach most of the brain\nareas including medulla oblongata where cardiorespiratory\ncontrolling nuclei are located.8",

Recetly it was shown in fish\nthat ORNs initiate ultrarapid immune responses after binding rhabdovirus\nsurface glycoprotein.10 The virus binding results in\nneuronal activation and proinflammatory effects in OE but inhibits\ninflammation in the brain. As a consequence, some neurons undergo apoptosis,\nwhich may inhibit the reception of olfactory stimuli for some time. This\ndata reveals the possible universal role of ORNs as first line viral sensors\nand initiators of antiviral protective immune responses. Based on the above\nconclusion, there is an exciting possibility that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ORNs\ninitiates that kind of rapid immune response. Induction of the innate immune\nsystem through ORNs does not necessarily have to be mediated by ACE2 and\nTMPRSS2, but it may require additional yet unidentified host protein(s) with\nthe ability to transmit intracellular signaling. From this point of view,\ninfected people who show signs of olfactory dysfunctions may actually\nrepresents those individuals with faster and/or stronger immune response and\nbetter body mobilization against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it\nwill be interesting to examine groups of patients with and without olfactory\ndysfunction and correlate it with the severity of their symptoms and\npercentage of recovery.
