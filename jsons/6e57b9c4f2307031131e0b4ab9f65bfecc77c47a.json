Therefore, a cost effective break mitigation technique such as a failure forecasting model that allows one to predict the water mains failure likelihood, would reduce the negative social impact and the cost to serve. We introduce a semiparametric Bayesian model for pipeline failure forecasting. The model is centred on a nonparametric Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and uses a parametric survival model to capture the long-term survival probability using domain knowledge. The parametric element in our model allows the inclusion of survival probability, while the nonparametric part allows us to handle covariates and to employ incomplete prior knowledge about pipe failures. We apply our model to the proactive maintenance problem using a real dataset from a water utility in Australia. The results demonstrate that, our model performs better than competing models such as Support Vector Regression, Poisson regression, Weibull, Gradient Boosting, and GPR, leading to substantial savings on reactive repairs and maintenance. Our water pipeline failure prediction models have been deployed in three states across Australia, and are being monitored by each water authority.",

The breakage of a water main could have far reaching consequences, including intangible costs that can have a significant effect upon the wider community. Not only could such an event have immediate disastrous impacts to the surrounding area, there would also be long-term socioeconomic impact on power, water and other supplies to suburbs. Figure 1 (a) shows a sinkhole which has swallowed cars (and three houses have been flooded) after a water main burst in Port Melbourne. This shows potential consequences stemming from a burst pipeline. The burst failures in the water main network in a region in Australia is shown in Fig. 1 (b) . Across the entire region under our study, an average number of 400 pipe failures occur each year, causing water supply disruptions and myriads of property and environmental damages. Even while this manuscript was being drafted, two water main bursts have severely affected up to 60 houses in Sydney, Australia, within just 5 days apart [1] . A recent report from the Australian Infrastructure Statistics Yearbook indicates that the maintenance cost for water assets is over 1.4 billion Australian dollars in Australia [3] .

To effectively achieve these objectives, machine learning techniques can be used with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

In that study, the authors used a Poisson model based on the age of the pipes. Most recently, tree-based machine learning techniques have been used to predict water pipe failure rates in VIC (Victoria) [26] and (Queensland) [16] , Australia and Syracuse, USA [14] . However, tree based models are generally not capable to provide accurate predictions for extremely sparse components [15] , such as a critical water main. Furthermore, prediction of water main breaks has been studied using survival-based methods, such as Poisson regression and Weibull model [2] . Survival analysis focuses on the study of time-to-event data, usually called survival times. These models are usually limited by their fixed model structure and their inability to adaptively adjust the model to the complexity of the problem. There is also a vast literature of estimating hazard function in survival analysis using Bayesian nonparametric techniques [11] . Even though these algorithms are flexible, it cannot incorporate expert knowledge which is fundamental for applications like pipe failure prediction [7] . The work reported in [8] defines a Gaussian process prior over the hazard function which models the hazard function as the multiplication of a parametric baseline hazard and a nonparametric part. In our proposed method, we model survival function on a set of clusters (based on pipe laid years) to predict the future pipe breakage. This parametric component is then embedded into the prior and likelihood of a Gaussian Process.",

Thus, prediction of water main breaks becomes a complicated task due to their low failure rate and high cost of inspection, which have led to sparse historical data. As such, the underlying function which governs the pipeline failure rates is fairly sophisticated, making it difficult to obtain a suitable model by looking only at the input data. Therefore, a nonparametric prediction method like GPR is more suitable [19] . Such methods allow the data to speak for itself and require minimal assumptions on the data. Nevertheless, regression can face issues when dataset is very sparse. When we consider the datasets obtained from Australian water utilities, the general 10-12 year observation period was relatively short compared to the life cycle of water pipes (which could be more than 100 years), so that most (about 99%) pipes do not fail or fail just once during the observation period, making the data sparse (despite the low failure rate, the failure of a critical water main could lead to heavy financial losses). Trying to learn a flexible model with a few data points may result in overfitting where the model mistakes artefacts of the specific available samples as actual properties of the underlying distribution [4, 25] . When forecasting water main failures we encounter this issue, with the sparse incident data. Our proposed approach aims to solve limitations of these commonly used machine learning techniques.",

One challenge is to predict whether the Pipe 4 will fail on age t * 1 to t * 2 in the future. Another challenge is to forecast failure likelihoods of older pipes a few years into the future (e.g. predict whether the Pipe 1 will fail at the age of t * n ). For the first case, an intuitive method can be used to determine the failure rate at the age of t * 1 and t * 2 using the observed failure rates of Pipes 1-3. However, what is the relation between pipe i and j, which we will denote as k(i, j)? Thus, we need to know how to transfer k (3, 4) and k(1, 3) into k (1, 4) . In more a complicated scenario, we can write k(i, j) as k t (i, j) to assume the variation of relationship with time. The intricate interplay among these underlying functions is sophisticated, making it difficult to obtain a suitable model by looking only at the input data such as pipeline features and corresponding failure rates. Therefore, a nonparametric prediction method such as GPR is more suitable [19] to handle this sort of prediction tasks. In the second scenario, when the prediction duration is very long, we do not have much data for the overlapped age period (or in the worst case scenario, there is no overlapping age period as in t * n ). In order to tackle this challenge, we employed a survival based technique to model the age based relationship and embedded the results into the prior and likelihood of the GPR. This will be further described in the next section.",

In addition, environmental and demographic factors need to be matched with the network data. Specifically, failure records and information are assigned to the corresponding assets based on the work order number, and environmental and demographic information are assigned to the assets based on the geographic locations. To quantify the underlying factors affecting pipe failures, in each of the factor in isolation, we calculate the mutual information between the 'Pipe Failure' parameter and each feature (we have selected a primary set of asset specific features). Pipe size (or diameter) shares the highest amount of mutual information with failures while pipe type has the least effect on failures.",

In addition to collectively considering the aforementioned feature set, we intend to further improve the proposed GPR procedure by incorporating the estimated survival probability of each pipe in the prior and likelihood of the predictive posterior. For this purpose, we aim to populate a newly calculated survival probability estimate feature in both our training and test datasets. The Kaplan-Meier estimate is considered as one of the most widely used non-parametric estimators of the survival function S(t). It has often been utilized to estimate the survival probabilities when the inputs include censored data [5, 20] . For censored subjects, the event occurred (or will occur) sometime after the date of last follow-up. However, it is not customary to ignore these subjects, as they provide some information about survival: it is known that they survived beyond a certain point, although the exact timing of the event is unknown [9] . We will first utilize the available training data to obtain the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier survival estimate as [13] ,\u015c",

As we shall show later in our results section, the Weibull survival probability estimate [23] fulfills this requirement. The Weibull survival probability is a continuous function featured by two parameters, namely, the scale parameter and the shape parameter. Due to these two parameters functioning simultaneously, the Weibull model provides a parametric distribution with additional flexibility compared to models with single parameters such as the exponential distribution [17] .

We then estimated the survival probabilities for pipes with ages 15 to 41 using the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate presented in Eq. (1). We used the full training dataset for this purpose, assuming that each failure could be treated as a first time failure (which allows to compute the age at failure starting from the actual laid date for the pipe) and obtained the Kaplan-Meier survival curve depicted in Fig. 3 (b) . We then considered parametric survival models to extrapolate the survival probabilities beyond the maximum observed age in the inputs (training data), for the purpose of populating the survival probability feature in the testing data. It was evident that Weibull survival probability given by Eq. (2) closely aligns with the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate for the training age span, as depicted by Fig. 3 (b) . Thus, we obtained the extrapolated Weibull survival probability estimates for the full age span (15 to 46) using the same assumptions, and only the training data as inputs. These results were used to populate the survival probability feature of both training and test datasets. ",

Therefore, instead of inferring the parameters to get the latent function of interest (as in parametric methods), here we infer the function f(x) given in Eq. (3) directly, as if the function f(x) represents the 'parameters' of our model. We have inferred the function f(x) from the data through the Bayesian inference to obtain a probability distribution for each pipeline failure. In order to quantify the prediction performance of our model, we extensively studied the AUC curves generated by each machine learning technique for each testing year from 2012-2016. The results are populated in the Table 2 . The highest AUC is reported for the proposed semiparametric model, which shows that the proposed method outperforms all the other techniques for all the 5 testing years. In general, the proposed GPR technique tends to maintain the same accuracy as the predictions are made further into the future.",

For this study, the suburbs within a state are first sorted, based on the cumulative probability of all the pipes within the suburb for a given prediction year. This forms a suburb based dataset and the general procedure is then followed to obtain the suburb based ROC curve. In the suburb based analysis, we notice that by the aggregation of pipe failure probabilities predicted by proposed model across suburbs, we were able to predict a significant proportion of pipe failures. In Fig. 3 (c) , we clearly see that when we inspect top 10 risky suburbs, 60%-70% of the pipe failures were recovered. Our analysis of critical suburbs also reveals quite interesting facts regarding pipe failures and their distribution across suburbs. As Fig. 3 (c) demonstrates, the proposed model performs well in precisely recalling suburbs with greater-than-average numbers of failures in all 5 years into the future. These results suggest that in a given year, the pipe failures are clustered in a few vulnerable suburbs. Prediction uncertainty for the long-term failure prediction has been obtained and illustrated with the mean prediction and actual failure rates as shown in Fig. 3 (d)-(e) for AC (Asbestos Cement), PVC (Plasticized Polyvinyl Chloride) separately. These long-term prediction curves show that actual failure rates align with the results generated by the prediction model and lie within the uncertainty interval. The mean failure prediction is ideal for modelling future behaviour of pipeline network benchmarking performance indices such as unplanned water interruption and water main breaks. In addition to the mean prediction, all the water utilities require uncertainty interval of the prediction. This is required to evaluate the impact and cost of more targeted water network levels of service to inform both short and long-term renewals budgets.",

This will allow us to target our condition assessment activity so that the pipes in poor-condition are found with the same level of condition assessment activity. It could also be possible to avoid replacement of those pipes that still have a safe level of remaining service life, providing more effective use of our assets.

We have presented a thorough survey of the landscape of semiparametric survival analysis as it pertains to predictions of survival rates and correspondingly decease rates of assets. We have used data from the water management authorities to validate the survival analysis technique we propose, to compare against other popular machine learning techniques that have been proven effective the in similar applications. We performed a thorough analysis of the performance of the techniques in making predictions over multiple years. The results show that the semiparametric Gaussian process has consistently shown to outperform the other techniques. This is one of our ongoing predictive analytics projects, which is being carriedout in close collaboration with Australian water authorities.
