We propose an epidemiological model for forecasting and policy evaluation which incorporates new data in real-time through variational data assimilation. We analyze and discuss infection rates in China, the US and Italy. In particular, we develop a custom compartmental SIR model fit to variables related to the epidemic in Chinese cities, named SITR model. We compare and discuss model results which conducts updates as new observations become available. A hybrid data assimilation approach is applied to make results robust to initial conditions. We use the model to do inference on infection numbers as well as parameters such as the disease transmissibility rate or the rate of recovery. The parameterisation of the model is parsimonious and extendable, allowing for the incorporation of additional data and parameters of interest. This allows for scalability and the extension of the model to other locations or the adaption of novel data sources.",

            "text": "The global outbreak of n-Cov2019 and the possibility of severe social and economic costs worldwide requires immediate action on suppresion measures. In order to evaluate the efficacy of past and future policy measures to fight and contain the spread of n-Cov2019, a robust and quantifiable analysis system is required. We propose a methodology for forecasting the spread of the virus and show how to estimate latent infection rates, accounting for high uncertainty in observation and model specification. This is done by combining real-time Bayesian updating with epidemiological models. We develop a custom compartmental SIR model which is fit to data related to the spread of the coronavirus in China which we name SITR. This is embedded in a data assimilation framework, a form of recursive Bayesian estimation [1] , which conducts model updates when new observations become available. A hybrid data assimilation approach is applied to make results robust to initial conditions. We use the model to infer the amount of infected people and both, the disease transmissibility rate, as well as the rate of recovery. The time-varying parameter structure of the model allows for the incorporation and analysis of policy action, such as if the shutdown of transportation or closure of schools affect transmissibility. In line with other researchers, our model estimates indicate that the number of infected people is a number of magnitudes higher than the actual reported number of hospitalized people in China. We also find that compared to static models, updating the parameters in a dynamic fashion leads to an upward correction of the true number of infected people as well as reducing forecasting errors. We estimate both short term and long term dynamics in Wuhan and find a peak of infections in the beginning of March. We furthermore apply the model to data to a selection of developed and developing countries and find that infections peak in the middle of April. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section two discusses related work. Section three and four introduce the dynamic model as well as the SITR compartmental model. Section five discusses the empirical results and section six concludes.",

Using compartmental models in epidemiology, authors such as [2] , [3] and [4] have done the first studies on the size of the outbreak in China. They applied standard SIR models with static parameters to estimate the basic reproductive number and analyze the exponential growth of the virus in Wuhan. The work of [4] in particular combines standard SEIR models with travel data obtained from Tencent and found that epidemic dynamics show exponential patterns in multiple major cities with a lag behind the Wuhan outbreak of about one to two weeks. First studies using data assimilation for epidemiological modelling have been conducted by other authors such as [5] and [6] , which studied the techniques on different cases such as influenza using standard SIR models, although none has considered the issue of the robust covariance estimates as discussed in [7] or [8] . Further studies such as [9] and [10] study time varying parameters in more detail, although only for standard SIR models with no relationship to the current corona virus outbreak. We are the first to conduct a study of the current spread of 2019-nCoV using data assimilation. We furthermore contribute by providing a novel framework which enables the prior computation of covariance matrices, adding robustness to epidemiological assimilation models.",

DA is a vital step in numerical modeling and has become a main component in the development and validation of mathematical models in meteorology, climatology, geophysics, geology and hydrology [12] . Recently, DA is also applied to numerical simulations of geophysical applications, medicine, biological science and finance. Data assimilation can be applied to a variety of problems where an uncertainty quantification has to be included [13] or where latent parameters need to be computed taking into account new observations. The Adaptive DA-SIR model is a model which incorporates Data Assimilation with a compartmental SIR model. We use DA as an adaptive modelling approach which integrates new observations into our compartmental model to enhance the accuracy of forecasts as well as computing model parameters of interest, in our case \u03b2 and \u03b3 in the SIR model.",

Where I DA t are the values of I t computed after the assimilation of R obs t as in Eq. 8. To illustrate and put results into perspective, we compare results of our adaptive DA-SIR model with the common SIR model for Wuhan. Both models use the same initial conditions given by the observed data. In Fig. 1 we compare model performance of the standard SIR model and show how assimilation of new observations generates updated model dynamics in the DA-SIR model that do differ from standard SIR model predictions by a wide margin, as is illustrated in the figure. Selected values of the graph are available in Table 1 where we compare estimated cases and infection rates for both the static SIR, and dynamic DA-SIR model. This illustrates how without updating the parameters the number of infected people is underestimated and the assimilation of new observations helps to adjust the trajectory of likely infections in the future. Having shown the large difference between static and dynamic SIR models we next introduce a further refined extension of the dynamic assimilation model. ",

Compared to Wuhan, the peak of the infection occurs five days before Wuhan on the 2nd of February, showing that low early infection levels as well as quarantine measures introduced by the government led to a rapid decline of infection cases.
