Most recent studies of the burden of influenza disease have focused on healthcare visits; few have examined the community-wide burden of influenza in the general population [5, 6]. Because many individuals with influenza disease do not seek medical care but are nevertheless ill enough to miss work or school [7\u201312], the high morbidity documented in studies of influenza-related illness may underestimate the burden of influenza. With vaccination coverage hovering at only 50% (43% in the 2010\u20132011 season, http://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage_1011estimates.htm) [13] despite universal vaccination recommendations [14], it is important to understand the full impact of this virus at the population level.",

A Healthy People 2020 goal is to prevent disease, disability, and death from infectious disease. Population-level surveillance is an integral step in assessing morbidity from ARIs. Also vaccines are in development for several viral pathogens including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [15], parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) [16], and human metapneumovirus (hMPV, first identified in the early 2000s) which are significant causes of hospitalizations, ED visits and outpatient visits [2, 17\u201319]. Longitudinal community-based surveillance studies conducted in the 1960s\u20131980s found that RSV and PIVs accounted for many ARIs [6, 20\u201324] yet few recent studies have assessed their population-wide burden and little is known about the incidence of hMPV in the general population. Finally, while rhinoviruses (RVs) [25], coronaviruses (CoVs) [26], and other viruses [2] are known to cause medically attended ARI-related visits, studies on their population-wide burden are lacking. Such knowledge could guide future vaccine development.",

The RCS design was first described and used by political scientists in the early 1980s for studies of voter preferences and election results; it consists of a series of cross-sectional samples in which each sample is representative of the source population [28]. A random sample of subjects was selected each week and then interviewed by telephone to identify those with ARIs and to obtain demographic and disease-specific information. Consenting individuals provided nasal and throat swabs which were tested in a research laboratory by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR) for a wide spectrum of viruses.",

Across the United States, the 2010\u20132011 influenza season was less severe than the 2009\u20132010 pandemic year or the 2007\u20132008 seasonal influenza season, but more severe than the 2008\u20132009 influenza season, with overall hospitalization rates around 19\u201320/100 000 individuals of all ages [40]. Further, despite suboptimal influenza vaccination rates, influenza vaccination may have lowered the relative disease burden from this virus, although the tremendous variability in the timing, intensity, and duration of influenza circulation from year-to-year makes such assessments difficult. Vaccination rates were 59% and 41% in the Rochester and Marshfield study populations, respectively, and it was estimated that vaccine effectiveness in preventing medically attended influenza visits in a four-community study that included both Rochester and Marshfield was 60% during the same influenza season as assessed in our study [31]. Moreover, while our criteria for definition of ARIs comprised a list of symptoms used by other studies of medically attended ARI-related visits, these criteria may have been too broad and some patients labelled with ARI in this study may not have had a respiratory virus. For example, we included feverishness as one ARI criteria.",

Our study strongly suggests that the burden of ARIs is vastly greater than the burden demonstrated by studies limited to ARI-associated healthcare visits. Thus, efforts to develop vaccines to reduce ARIs have the potential for substantial benefit in reducing the disease burden from community-based ARIs as well as reducing medically attended healthcare visits. Future studies should consider collecting additional data on the morbidity of ARIs that do not result in visits to healthcare providers.",

However, we caution against over-interpretation of our findings due to several important limitations. First, we studied only two communities, during a single respiratory season over a 3-month period which missed the peak season for PIV and RV. Geographical and seasonal variability in the viral aetiologies of ARI are substantial [2, 7, 10], for example, it is difficult to draw inferences about ARI incidence or virus burden from a single season of surveillance. Also, the relative contribution of some viruses might be different had we included a longer study period. Second, while our strict definition of ARIs (current illness with feverishness or cough) likely excluded other causes of stuffiness such as allergies, we may have missed some ARIs. Third, we interviewed only two-thirds of persons contacted, and obtained nasal/throat specimens for only two-thirds of ARI cases. We are aware of some selection bias in subjects agreeing to be interviewed. For example, Rochester subjects who agreed were more likely than the original sampling frame to be male and adult. While others have noted lower ARI reports in men [41], our ARI findings do not vary by gender; also we stratify findings by age group. It is possible that subjects from whom specimens were collected differed by viral aetiology or other characteristics. Fourth, despite making >38 000 telephone calls, we were able to collect only 208 nasal/throat swabs from subject with ARIs. Our sample sizes for individual viruses are small. Fifth, we may have missed some subjects who would have tested positive for a viral respiratory pathogen because we performed nasal swabs and used TAC detection methods rather than nasopharyngeal swabs and more sensitive conventional PCR assays. Sixth, we selected subjects with symptoms for \u2a7d7 days, but it is possible that some were no longer shedding virus, especially if they underestimated their days of symptoms prior to being contacted. Finally, we simply summed estimated weekly ARI incidence to derive a cumulative incidence, using a RCS design. This method has not yet been validated against more standard methods to calculate cumulative incidence in traditional cohort studies.",

Of those with ARIs, influenza infection accounted for only 4% of cases, while RSV, PIV, RV, CoV, and hMPV accounted for the bulk of ARIs. In individuals with ARIs, four-fifths did not make a visit to a healthcare provider because of their symptoms. ARIs due to both influenza and other viruses cause substantial morbidity undetected by the healthcare delivery system. In an era when actively following large cohorts of consenting subjects for disease surveillance purposes is expensive and resource intensive, the use of RCS designs similar to ours may offer a reasonable alternative strategy for conducting surveillance for more common illnesses. New vaccines for several common respiratory viruses may hold promise for further reducing the population-wide disease burden from ARIs.",
