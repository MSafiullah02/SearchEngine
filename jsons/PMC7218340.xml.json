Polyprotein 1a is translated from ORF1a, while production of pp1ab (encoded by both ORF1a and ORF1b) requires a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift before the translation stop codon on ORF1a is reached. This frameshift has been shown to occur in the overlap region between ORFs 1a and ORF1b. Both polyproteins are post-translationally processed by two viral proteases to yield 16 mature proteins necessary for viral RNA replication. The remaining one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins (Spike(S), Envelope (E), Matrix(M), and Nucleocapsid(N) and an unknown number of accessory proteins.11 Contrary to the replicase proteins, which are directly translated from genomic RNA, the structural and accessory proteins are expressed from a nested set of sub-genomic RNAs. In addition to coding sequences, the coronavirus genome also contains highly structured, non-coding regions at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the genome, which are believed to play a regulatory role in viral genome replication and protein expression.13,14",

The use of a synonymous codon is not random. During an organism\u2019s evolutionary history, a bias for a particular synonymous codon will be formed within a species or gene, which ensures that the most frequently used codons can pair with the anticodons of the most abundant tRNA genes.15,16 Since viruses do not encode translational functions and depend exclusively on the host cell machinery to synthesize viral proteins, the expression of viral genes is temporally regulated by adjusting the codons usage to match or contrast the host tRNA resources. The expression levels of papillomaviruses capsid proteins L1 and L2 depend on the match between the codon usage and tRNA availability in the host cells.17,18 The presence of low prevalence codons in hepatitis A virus genes facilitates the correct folding of HAV proteins.19 Herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus maintain low prevalence codons in their genes.20,21 Considering such intimate dependence, codon usage bias analyses can provide useful insights into the adaptation of virus, the effect of the host on its codon usage, the factors driving the codon usage bias, and the regulation of viral gene expression.",

Cytosine deamination and selection of CpG suppressed clones by the immune system are major selective forces that shape codon usage bias in coronavirus genomes.22 The nucleotide biases are more pronounced in the unpaired regions of the structured RNA genome, creating a virus-specific signature that may suggest a certain biological function for these distinctive sequence signatures.23,24 The codon usage bias analyses of MERS-CoV PLpro and 3CLpro proteases indicate a disproportional effect of compositional constraints and directed mutation pressure on codon usage in each protein.25 The comparative analysis of human and animal MERS-CoV isolates suggests that mutational bias is a major determinant of codon usage bias in human/camel isolates, whereas natural selection pressure appeared to be the key determinant of codon usage in bat/hedgehog isolates.26 Although the MERS-CoV genome is a mono-partite RNA, as many as 10 different proteins are expressed from a series of subgenomic mRNAs produced during virus infection. Non-structural proteins are required for early stages of the viral life cycle and the presence of optimal codons may be desired for the rapid accumulation of these proteins in infected cells. On the other hand, structural proteins are potentially immunogenic and often required for late stages of the virus life cycle; therefore, the gradual accumulation of these proteins may be beneficial for virus replication without mounting a host immune response.",

We analyzed 4751 MERS-CoV genes from 664 complete or partial genomic sequences to determine the extent of codon usage bias and the relative contribution of various evolutionary forces in shaping codon usage. The effective number of codons (ENC) value showed a moderate, gene-specific codon usage bias in MERS-CoV genome. Codon usage bias is mainly shaped by translational selection, while mutational pressure emerged as a minor factor in some genes. CpG suppression and cytosine deamination along with the physical and chemical properties of encoded proteins are other factors that affect MERS-CoV codon usage preferences.",

As shown in Figure 1A, the mean GC and AU compositions of MERS-CoV genome were 42.68 \u00b1 3.14% and 57.31 \u00b1 3.14%, respectively. The individual MERS-CoV genes exhibit similar strong compositional bias, except N and ORF8b genes with 47.309 \u00b1 0.20 and 49.283 \u00b1 0.19% G + C contents, respectively.

The G + C at first codon position is highest in all genes; however, the G + C at second and third codon positions are variable. In ORF4a, E, M, and ORF8b, the G + C at second codon position are lowest, while in ORF1ab, S, ORF3, ORF4b, ORF5, and N gene, the G + C at third codon position are lowest (Figure 1B).

However, when GC3 of individual genes were plotted against the corresponding GC12, a significant correlation between GC3 and GC12 was observed for all genes, except ORF 4b (r = 0.028, P < .54). The slope of the individual neutrality plots indicates relative neutralities ranging from 1.6% to 35.52% (Figure 3B). The ORF3 had the highest relative neutrality values of 35.52% indicating a significant impact of neutral evolution (mutational pressure) on codon preference in this gene. Although highly significant correlations between GC3 and GC12 was observed in remaining genes, the slopes of regression lines indicate that less than 16% of codon usage bias in these genes is explained by mutational pressure. These data suggest that different evolutionary pressures are acting disproportionally on MERS-CoV genes.

            "text": "Natural selection and mutation pressure are two main factors that account for codon usage variation in different organisms.34,63 The ENC plot suggested that codon usage bias in MERS-CoV was not the sole result of the random accumulation of mutations. Despite the significant correlation between GC12 and GC3 for most of the genes, the slope of the neutrality plot suggests that only a fraction (< 16%) of codon usage bias in these genes is due to mutational pressure. Translational selection appears to be the major determinant of codon usage in MERS-CoV. Like many mammalian RNA viruses and retroviruses,64,65 the CpG dinucleotide is markedly under-represented in the MERS-CoV coding sequence. The precise mechanism that contributes to CpG under-representation in RNA viruses is still largely unknown; the selection of CpG suppressed clones by host immune system and methylation-deamination are the most likely mechanisms responsible for CpG suppression in RNA viruses.22 Studies of influenza and picornaviruses indicate that the innate immune response might recognize RNA-specific CpG motifs, such that the suppression of CpG in viruses could assist immune evasion.66,67 In contrast, other studies have suggested that dinucleotide bias in viruses simply reflects background mutation pressure.55,68 Comparative analysis of CpG suppression in coding and non-coding regions of the MERS-CoV genome indicates significantly lower CpG content in the MERS-CoV coding region than the non-coding region. The loss of CpG dinucleotides by deamination of methylated cytosines within CpG dinucleotides results in a gain of TpG and CpA dinucleotides.64 However, the increase in UpG and CpA dinucleotides in the coding region was not much different than that in the non-coding region. This suggests that CpG suppression was not simply a consequence of host methylation capabilities; rather, it was a combined effect of multiple biochemical and evolutionary pressures specifically acting on CpG dinucleotide.22",

The formation of codon usage bias in the MERS-CoV genome is affected mainly by natural selection. Mutational pressure emerged as a minor factor affecting codon usage in some MERS-CoV genes. Dinucleotide bias, specifically the CpG suppression has significantly limited the use of CG containing codon. The depletion of CpG was a combined effect of evolutionary pressures specifically acting on CpG dinucleotide and compositional constraints imposed by the nucleotide composition of the genome. Other factors that influenced codon usage included the gene length and protein properties. The subtle differences in the levels of MERS-CoV gene expression in humans and dromedary camel and the sharp contrast in the severity of diseases between two hosts warrant further studies to determine the relationship between viral gene expression and severity of the disease. Several coronavirus proteins have been identified as interferon antagonist69 and, by inference, optimal expression of these genes is essential for viral pathogenesis. Taken together, these results provided considerable insight into the genome composition and evolution of MERS-CoV and may provide a theoretical basis for optimizing MERS-CoV gene expression to study the functional relevance of various MERS-CoV proteins. Alternatively, with affordable and readily available gene manipulation tools, attenuated vaccine strains containing hundreds of silent mutations can be engineered to mitigate the chances of reversal to pathogenic wild type.70",
