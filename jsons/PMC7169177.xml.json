In particular, during acute upper respiratory tract infections, the infection rates of MP and viruses (mainly influenza virus B (FluB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and adenovirus (ADV)) can be even higher than those of bacterial pathogens. In addition, new viruses are being discovered, such as human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses (NL63 and HKU1).9, 10 Many studies have also shown that MP and viruses display seasonal variations in infection and that mixed infections with multiple pathogens are common. Furthermore, many viruses show high infectivity, rapid transmission, short latency and acute manifestations; and they may also fail to induce lifelong immunity following diseases. The characteristics of these pathogens can lead to high morbidity and mortality, as well as disease pandemics.11, 12 Hence, the detection of viruses and atypical bacteria is crucially important.",

In addition, the overall detection rate was associated with the number of distinct types of pathogens being detected.

We found that the detection rates of RSV were higher in the winter of 2010 and the summer of 2011, similar to the findings reported by Fabbiani et al.22 and Noyola et al.23 Seasonal fluctuations of infection by PIV were not evident; on the other hand, Yeolekar et al.24 and Maitreyi et al.25 reported that infection by PIV was most common in the winter and spring.

This finding is consistent with the results of Chan et al.27 and demonstrates that this disease can have epidemic during the winter and spring as well as summer. Our study found that the epidemic seasons of certain pathogens were different from those found in other reports, which was most likely due to local climate and population differences. Climate is an important factor. An example of this is that RSV has a higher prevalence in summer in tropical countries (e.g. Vietnam)13 but a higher incidence in winter in temperate regions (e.g. Germany and South Korea).6, 17\n",

The reason may be that MP, FluB and RSV were the most common pathogens of single infection; besides, there may be some similarities in their epidemic season. Mixed infection is likely the result of damage to airway mucosal cells caused by a prior pathogen (such as MP), allowing other pathogens to infect a patient. Mixed infections may also be associated with the relatively poor health and immune function of children, the long course of certain diseases, long hospitalizations or physical contact with other patients. It is also important to be aware that the detection rate of mixed infection is very dependent on methodology29 and how many types of pathogens are being studied.",
