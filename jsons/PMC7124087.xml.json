            "text": "Human security was defined as freedom from want, freedom from fear, and the centrality of dignity by the Commission on Human Security (2003). This was subsequently endorsed by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly when it referred to the \u201cright of people to live in freedom and dignity\u201d (UNGA 2012). Although the actual term \u201chuman security\u201d (\u4eba\u7684\u5b89\u5168 in Chinese) has not been widely used thus far, similar ideas or practices have been flourishing in China. In response to the questions underlying the emergence of human security norms, this chapter attempts to elaborate on China\u2019s experience and progress with regard to human security by, respectively, dealing with three major issues, namely, how the idea of human security is understood or defined by the government and social actors; the ways in which the distinctions between the \u201c protection\u201d and \u201c empowerment\u201d aspects of human security are understood and accepted; and what particular downside risks are perceived as pressing human security issues in China. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the overall human security practices and shows that, based on current indicators, China is heading in a healthy direction in terms of promoting human security.",

However, the findings from our previous study (Ren and Li 2013) clearly showed that the country is following a trajectory of increasingly attaching more importance to human (both individual and collective) security . Much greater attention has been paid to mitigating threats to human security, and practical measures are being taken to fulfill the mandate. We emphasized the convergence of the human security idea and China\u2019s practices (Ren and Li 2013). Our findings disprove the following statement: \u201cthe very notion of \u2018human security\u2019 has so far not appeared in the Chinese language in any possible translation, and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has not even accepted or adopted the concept of human security in either domestic development papers or foreign policy guidelines\u2026\u201d (Wu 2013, 1). Our examination suggests otherwise. Though the Chinese government has only used the term \u201chuman security\u201d on a few occasions, China is definitely engaged in the enterprise of enhancing human security.",

Over the years, the UN has been subjected to criticisms and it is widely believed that reforms are needed, which China supports. Nevertheless, Beijing continues to show a belief that the UN plays an irreplaceable role in global governance, and China has endeavored to support this by encouraging the UN to play its role well (Kim 1999). This has remained an unchanged priority in China\u2019s foreign policy agenda.",

Meanwhile, the UN has taken the lead in advocating and/or spreading norms and principles, and this has affected and helped to shape China\u2019s ideas (Kent 2014). Usually, UN initiatives or proposals attract China\u2019s attention, and prompt Beijing to have a closer look at them before taking actions to adapt to the new norms or principles (Morton 2009, 75\u201376). For example, China was involved in the deliberations and adoption of the UN World Summit Outcome Document in 2005. Although it is not the same thing as the \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d idea proposed by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS 2001), to some extent the Outcome Document is consistent with this idea in terms of thinking on protection. The Outcome Document attempts to strike a balance between the need to protect innocent people around the world from being harmed while avoiding the abuse of external intervention or selfish behavior in the name of protection. For this, the Outcome Document imposes limitations by listing four specific crimes against which the international community should act to prevent people\u2019s lives from being jeopardized: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. In this way, the Outcome Document has become a new international legal document. China was involved in this process and made its own contribution. Thus, involvement in global or regional institutions has pushed China to clarify or develop its own thinking on human security.",

The core of the Chinese Dream of the revival of the Chinese nation proposed by President Xi Jinping is to have the 1.3 billion Chinese people live a happy life. In other words, all ordinary people have the right and are entitled to live with dignity in a secure environment. This is the attraction of China\u2019s success story to the world, as well as the charm of the Chinese dream.1 This line of thinking has many elements in common with the widely shared \u201chuman security\u201d idea. For instance, both place emphasis on individuals and their happiness, and this must be fulfilled together with national development. Ends and means should be consistent, and the persistent value is that people themselves are the end and they should not be sacrificed for arbitrary national goals.",

In the current era, the concept of national security is becoming richer in depth and wider in breadth, involving a range of issues in a variety of areas.

In the meantime, the commission\u2019s work involves two dimensions (both external and internal) rather than just one. Thus the \u201csecurity\u201d the initiative refers to is of a comprehensive nature. It is not difficult to come to that conclusion if we simply recall the July 5, 2009, incident in Xinjiang, the riots in Tibet and Tibet-related self-immolations in its neighboring provinces, and the horrible killing at the Kunming Railway Station on March 1, 2014. During all these incidents, innocent people were killed or injured, and some of the incidents resulted from the actions by hostile external forces. That is why it was widely believed that internal security would be the dominant concern for China\u2019s NSC , at least in its early stage. When ordinary people can be unexpectedly harmed by violent terrorist attacks in any situation and without warning, a sense of insecurity arises, and this can be frightening. Thus, even though freedom from want is no longer a problem in today\u2019s China, ordinary people should also be able to live their lives free from fear. A broad concept of security of this kind logically became the goal for China\u2019s NSC .",

In fact, Chinese scholars speak highly of human security and argue that it goes beyond the limits of state-centric traditional security research and is the least traditional theory among the non-traditional security domains (Yu 2014, 18). Human security research explicitly sees people as a collectivity and individuals as the referent object of security. This transcends the dilemma of more traditional security theory, since the state can bring about insecurity to its citizens. Such a possibility raises questions concerning the relationship between state security and human security. In general, Chinese researchers do not endorse the view that human security overrides state security or that the two are confrontational, but rather affirm the reasonableness and value of state security at the same time.",

Shi argues that both state security and human security, in terms of their security concerns and value pursuits, have legitimate claims. However, there is no reason for either of them to become totally dominant. Human security is of course the fundamental goal and ultimate value of human development. The value orientation of putting people first , with human security at the center, provides it with the moral high ground and legitimacy. However, a person has both individuality and sociality, and individuals are often weak and helpless. Resisting foreign military invasion and safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity are therefore in the nation\u2019s common interest.

Therefore, this can provide a favorable opportunity for upgrading the overall security level of all entities.

In this sense, human security and state security are not necessarily contradictory.

Not long after, the debate abruptly came to a halt due to a political intervention. However, along with further economic reform and considerable social development, the awareness of the value of the individual human being in China was reawakened and the value of people confirmed. The initiative for humanism in the 1980s was in fact later accepted by the whole of Chinese society. This was also reflected in the discussions and research on human security, since it was made clear that guaranteeing human security is the value base for maintaining non-traditional security .

This is a goal that will justify and inform further reforms. The reaffirmation of realizing common prosperity in line with the principles of governing for the people and building a comprehensive and balanced well-off society will guide future reform with a clear direction.6 To fulfill its pledge to narrow the gap between rich and poor and to \u201cunwaveringly pursue common prosperity,\u201d the leaders have to place the people in their hearts and take their needs seriously in order to realize the goal of the \u201c Chinese dream.\u201d After the 18th Party Congress in 2012, the new General Secretary Xi Jinping expressed his view that \u201cto fulfill the people\u2019s desire for better lives is what we shall strive for.\u201d7 This statement sounded dear and close to the ordinary Chinese people.",

The capacity for development is what empowers an individual. Thus, a modernized China should not only accept empowerment through protection but also appreciate its importance in realizing human freedom and guaranteeing human security. Education as a right is the fundamental and most significant form of empowerment, as the human experience has repeatedly revealed. Thus, educational development is a significant way to empower people, especially compulsory education. China has reason to be proud in this regard. It has a tradition that puts significant emphasis on education, in which parents always try their best to pave the way for their children to receive a good education, and often they are willing to make sacrifices. In China, nine-year compulsory education has been in force for years. In 1989, Project Hope was set up as an educational support supplement, which later became well known throughout Chinese society. It was initiated by the Central Youth League and the China Juvenile Development Foundation as a philanthropic enterprise to help less developed areas to establish primary schools, to financially support children who have dropped out of school in the poorer regions to return to school, and to improve education in rural areas. The project received society-wide attention and support. Implemented successfully, the project has positively changed the fate of hundreds of thousands of children of poor families and has also beefed up the whole society\u2019s awareness of the importance of education, thereby improving China\u2019s fundamental education.",

An important part of it is to reshape a new social governance system. During the 2014 National People\u2019s Congress session, President Xi joined the Shanghai delegation for a deliberation of the government\u2019s work. For him, the key to future social governance is institutional innovation, and its core lies in people. Only when people are living harmoniously can society be operating in a stable and orderly manner. For Han Zheng, the party secretary of Shanghai, social governance was up to everybody, and the governing process should serve the all-round development of people. Rule of law is the foundation of social governance, without which there can be no base for long-standing good governance and robust stability.8 For that matter, among other things, it is necessary for grass-root cadres to regard people\u2019s concerns as their own matters, while always trying to understand their feelings and demands. Again, the key challenge is to make this happen in real life. Fortunately, in China there have been local autonomous grassroots organizations that play an intermediate role and serve to help in addressing problems at the grassroots level. They assist ordinary people who encounter difficulty, and they also, for example, mobilize donations to help people in the regions that have been struck by earthquakes or other natural disasters. The work of these local self-help organizations has proved to be useful and reassuring in terms of social governance.",

Among the five requests Xi made, one was logically to reinforce the measures to rein in air pollution. The top priority to combat air pollution and improve air quality was to control PM2.5, with major steps that included reducing the burning of coal, strictly limiting growth in the number of cars, adjusting industries, tightening management, and executing joint prevention and control.9 Xi\u2019s move clearly sent a signal that the government was committed to taking measures for better air quality.",

These measures are also basically valid for other cities. After all, fighting pollution is relevant to everybody\u2019s security, a point that has attracted a high-degree of consensus within Chinese society. Similarly, China\u2019s energy sector had a watershed year in 2013. Reforms that could have a profound impact on China\u2019s environment and energy policy were floated. With concerns over air pollution mounting throughout the year, the country is poised to shift away from its reliance on coal and toward use of cleaner forms of energy, including natural gas.
