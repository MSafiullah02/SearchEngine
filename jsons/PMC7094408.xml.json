            "text": "Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that were initially characterized by their capacity to induce chemotaxis or migration of leucocytes, and that play important roles in the inflammatory response. In response to inflammation or injury, higher levels of chemokines permit the attraction and retention of specific populations of lymphocytes. Thus, chemokines may have additional effects in healing infarcts beyond their leukotactic properties. Chemokines regulate angiogenesis, collagen turnover, and apoptosis and have been reported to be dysregulated in the end-stage of heart failure [6]. Chemokines also play an important role in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes, post-infarction left ventricular remodeling and chronic heart failure [7]. Interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 kDa (IP-10, also referred to as CXCL10) is a highly inducible, anti-angiogenic protein that belongs to the C-X-C chemokine superfamily [8]. Increased serum IP-10 levels have been reported in atherosclerotic patients [9]. In an experimental myocardial infarction model, IP-10 protein was shown to be transiently induced in the reperfused myocardium [10]. However, whether the serum IP-10 levels are increased in AMI patients and whether the serum level of IP-10 is correlated with infarct size, as indicated by cumulative creatine kinase (CK) release, peak CK or CK isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), in AMI patients has never been examined. Accordingly, we examined the change of serum IP-10 level in AMI patients and compared it with cumulative CK and peak CK and CK-MB.",

The eligible patients were first-AMI patients who received successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the infarct-related coronary artery within 12 h from the onset. A total of 33 consecutive patients (26 men and 7 women; mean age, 61 \u00b1 9 years) with AMI were admitted to the Cardiovascular Center, Sakakibara Hospital or Tsuyama Central Hospital (Okayama, Japan) from January 2000 to December 2001. The patients all had ST-segment elevated (0.2 mV) MI in more than two leads with chest pain sustained for longer than 30 min. Patients who had severe respiratory disease, liver disease, kidney disease, concomitant inflammatory diseases such as infections and autoimmune disorders, or malignancy were pre-excluded from this study. The extent of atherosclerotic regions in the vessels was diagnosed by X-ray coronary angiography (> 50% stenosis). The serum CK level and CK-MB level were determined every 4 h during the first and second days after admission and then once a day until the values returned to the normal range. All subjects with stable angina pectoris (AP) (n\n = 20, 16 men and 4 women; mean age, 63 \u00b1 9 years) had stable effort angina lasting longer than 6 months. The diagnosis was confirmed by coronary angiography, and defined as > 75% narrowing of the luminal diameter of at least one diseased vessel. The control subjects in the study were 20 gender- and age-matched healthy blood donors. Informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all individuals.",

This ELISA kit has been widely used for detecting serum IP-10 levels in a variety of diseases, and the measurement method has been well established in both normal subjects and diseased patients elsewhere [9], [20]. Briefly, a monoclonal antibody to human IP-10 is used for capture, and a biotinylated polyclonal antibody is used for detection. Recombinant human IP-10 served as a standard. The lower limit of sensitivity was 20 pg/mL, and the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were < 5% and < 7%, respectively. The investigators were blinded to the IP-10 levels during the determination of the cumulative CK release and peak CK and CK-MB.",

Differences in characteristics across quartiles were compared by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for dichotomous variables. Correlations between serum IP-10 levels and cumulative CK release were assessed by using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Because serum IP-10 level and cumulative CK release were not normally distributed, log-transformed values for these variables were used. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to assess the possible determinants of cumulative CK release. For the analysis, adjustments were performed with the following variables: age, gender, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker, calcium blocker, or aspirin, time to reperfusion, culprit lesion, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade before primary PCI, collateral flow before primary PCI, TIMI flow grade after PCI, and serum IP-10 level before PCI (pg/mL). All analyses were performed using SPSS 11.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) or StatView 5.0 (SAS Institute, San Francisco, CA). A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.",

The time courses of the serum IP-10 level of 23 patients with AMI who satisfied the inclusion criteria of the present study were investigated, and revealed that the mean level of serum IP-10 slightly decreased at 3 days (111.6 \u00b1 42.9 pg/mL), was elevated at 7 days (161.8 \u00b1 81.2 pg/mL), and continued to increase at 28 days (248.4 \u00b1 182.5 pg/mL), as shown in Fig. 2a. The serum IP-10 levels before PCI were significantly higher in the group of patients with multiple vessel disease (Fig. 2b). When the patients were classified into tertiles according to their serum IP-10 level before PCI, only the patients classified into the highest tertile showed a transient decrease of serum IP-10 level on day 3 (Fig. 2c). Accordingly, we determined the difference of serum IP-10 level between admission day and 3 days (calculated delta 3d IP-10 as serum IP-10ad level \u2212 serum IP-103d level). The delta 3d IP-10 was significantly lower only in the patients classified into the highest tertile (data not shown).",

Recently accumulated evidence has demonstrated an elevated serum level of IP-10 in various diseases, including inflammatory disease, and shown its utility as a clinically informative marker [26], [27], [28], [29]. For instance, Tang et al. reported that early, enhanced induction of IP-10 is an independent predictor of outcome for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients [30]. In myocardial infarction, Frangogiannis et al. found that IP-10 is primarily synthesized by ischemic microvascular endothelial cells and that its enhanced production declined within 24 h after reperfusion in an animal ischemia\u2013reperfusion model [10]. Rothenbacher et al. reported positive correlations of serum IP-10 levels with several acute-phase proteins or inflammation-associated cytokines in coronary heart disease patients [9]. Aukrust et al. recently reviewed the usefulness of serum or plasma chemokine levels to predict the risk of cardiovascular events, and suggested an important pathogenic role of chemokines in atherogenesis and plaque destabilization [31]. Our data showing elevated serum IP-10 levels in AMI were in line with these reports. In addition, serum IP-10 levels were rarely increased in stable angina patients in this study. Unstable angina patients were not enrolled because serum IP-10 levels were reported to be correlated with inflammation-associated cytokines, including IL-8 [9]. Therefore, it is postulated that the lack of increase in serum IP-10 level in AP patients in this study may have been related to their plaque stability.",

It should be noted that only the patients classified into the highest tertile for serum IP-10 level before PCI showed a decrease of serum IP-10 level at 3 days. This indicates that serum IP-10 level can increase remarkably before PCI under certain conditions in AMI patients and return to regular infarct healing process levels at 3 days after AMI. The increase of serum IP-10 level prior to PCI may be related to some beneficial conditions/situations for the ischemic heart (e.g., ischemic preconditioning or transient recanalization before arriving at the hospital) which could not be identified from this study, and that may be why the AMI patients who had higher serum IP-10 levels had a smaller infarct size. In addition, serum IP-10 level showed an increase of the mean level with more variance at 28 days after AMI. Little is currently known about the regulation of IP-10 after AMI, and it is possible that serum IP-10 levels increased in accordance with the development of heart failure, because elevated chemokine expression in patients with heart failure has been reported [6]. This may be, at least in part, an explanation for the wide variability of serum IP-10 levels on day 28 after AMI in this study. Therefore, further clinical investigations in patients with various cardiovascular diseases are needed, including monitoring of serum IP-10 levels in acute and chronic heart failure.",

There are many reports of attempts to estimate myocardial ischemic damage by measuring biomarkers in AMI patients. Ahumada et al. reviewed studies showing that CK-MB is a highly sensitive and specific biomarker of myocardial injury [32]. Recently, novel biomarkers, including troponin T (TnT) and troponin I (TnI), have been found and these factors have been evaluated for estimating infarct size. For instance, Licka et al. reported that serum TnT level (after 72 h after AMI) and peak CK were both significantly correlated with infarct size, as estimated by the uptake score of thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [17]. Younger et al. reported that TnI level 72 h after AMI was similarly useful to serial CK measurements for the estimation of infarct size using late gadolinium hyper-enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) [33]. Tanaka et al. reported that the peak TnT and TnI levels were correlated with peak CK level and cumulative CK release in successful reperfusion AMI patients [16]. Di Chiara et al. reported that peak CK was the best predictor of infarct size in first-AMI patients [18]. These studies indicate the usefulness of CK release and peak CK and CK-MB for estimating the infarct size. Thus, cumulative CK release and peak CK and CK-MB could be used to examine the relationship of the serum IP-10 level to the infarct size.",

First, the present study included a small number of patients because we carefully chose patients with a first AMI following successful reperfusion by primary PCI without any disease complications. Nevertheless, serum IP-10 level was significantly correlated with both cumulative CK release and peak CK, implying that our findings shed light on the role of IP-10 as an informative biomarker in AMI patients. A further study with a random sample of a larger population will of course be required to draw more definite conclusions. Second, we cannot exclude the possibility that the initial high serum IP-10 levels as well as the alteration of serum IP-10 levels in the patients in the present study were an epiphenomenon reflecting some unknown mechanisms that reduced the infarct size. There have been no reports of investigations of serum IP-10 levels in patients with severe heart disease such as acute heart failure and myocarditis. As discussed in the previous section, further clinical investigations of the serum level of IP-10 and its alterations in various cardiovascular disease will be required.",
