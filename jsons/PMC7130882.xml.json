This observation is of particular importance given the high prevalence of chronic disease and multi-morbidity in this age group, together with a poor understanding of the potential complications of influenza. Participants also expressed how the absence of advice from healthcare workers was interpreted as supporting their personal views that vaccination is not important, this illustrates the power of the unsaid.

The Community Health Assistance Scheme is also available for lower to middle income individuals to subsidise the cost.

This could be achieved with examples of individuals who have suffered complications from influenza, since a lack of encounter with serious episodes of influenza within one\u2019s social circle had been cited as a reason for trivialising flu. Furthermore, care should be taken to emphasize that side effects following vaccination are often mild, hence unlikely to affect activities of daily living. The introduction of an annual reminder system could prompt those who have received influenza vaccine to return for their yearly vaccination. This may be useful for older adults whose family members or caregivers lack time and attention to keep track of their vaccination schedule.",
