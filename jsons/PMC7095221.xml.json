In a French multicentre study on severe pneumococcal CAP admitted to intensive care units (ICU), the overall mortality rate was 29 %, with high proportions of patients in septic shock and needing mechanical ventilation [1]. Patients with severe CAP (SCAP) might die despite an early and adequate antibiotic treatment. This is probably due, in part, to a misbalanced and disproportionate local and systemic inflammatory response that contributes to impairment of gas exchange, sepsis and end-organ dysfunction [2].",

A meta-analysis [5] showed that steroids reduced mortality in the subgroup of patients with SCAP but not in the overall population. However, SCAP was not defined. Another more recent meta-analysis [6] showed that the use of systemic corticosteroids in CAP was associated with moderate reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation and development of ARDS, and, with high certainty, a reduction in time to clinical stability and duration of hospitalisation. The study also showed a possible reduction in mortality, but this effect was seen mainly in the subgroup of patients with SCAP. The last meta-analysis classified CAP studies as \u2018severe\u2019 when >70 % patients had baseline severe pneumonia, or if mortality was \u226515 % in the control arm when severity at presentation was not available.",

These patients have a low mortality and, consequently, it is very difficult to demonstrate differences in important outcomes such as treatment failure and mortality. Second, inclusion of patients regardless of the initial level of inflammation. According to the rationale of using steroids in CAP, a high inflammatory response is advisable to use this treatment. Up to now, this variable has not been taken into account in the majority of RCTs. Patients with a high inflammatory response, i.e. high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), have higher rates of treatment failure [7] and mortality [8]. Third, the dosages, the type and the length of treatment are very different among RCTs, which makes it very difficult to establish comparisons between them. Fourth, the primary end-points are different between studies, and some of them, such as length of stay or even time to clinical stability, are \u201csoft\u201d. The first one depends on other variables, and the second is driven by the persistence of fever which in fact is down-regulated by corticosteroids.",

Second, we chose patients with a high systemic inflammatory response (CRP > 15 mg/dL). Third, rather than mortality as a primary end-point, we chose treatment failure. Treatment failure in CAP is associated with higher mortality [10]. Treatment failure was defined as early (clinical deterioration indicated by the development of shock, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, not present at baseline, or death within 72 h) or late (radiographic progression or persistence of respiratory failure, development of shock, need for invasive mechanical ventilation not present at baseline or death between 72 and 120 h after treatment initiation). Fourth, we monitored the systemic inflammatory response using different biomarkers such as CRP, Procalcitonin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins 6, 8 and 10, until day 7 after the inclusion of patients in the trial.",

We recommend selecting SCAP patients with high inflammatory response measured by CRP.

We do not have information on the possible effect of corticosteroids in other viral pneumonias caused by adenovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncitial virus, or others such as MERS [13]. However, a high serum level of CRP indicates that pure viral pneumonia is unlikely. A proposed algorithm for the use of corticosteroids as adjunctive treatment for CAP is shown in Fig. 1.\n",
