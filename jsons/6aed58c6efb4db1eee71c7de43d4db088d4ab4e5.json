We are placed in the unique position of simultaneously providing for our patients, many of whom suffer from life threatening oncologic conditions or severe cardiac disease in the face of viral threats and hospital shortages, while also continuing to educate our surgical trainees during this uncertain time period. While much of the United States waits poised for the surge of COVID patients, our standard operating practices have gone by the wayside, and the trainees' schedules have been disrupted. Elective cases have been re-scheduled, and many providers have been re-distributed to hospital areas in dire need of physicians experienced in caring for critically ill patients. This poses a radical challenge for the continued education of our cardiothoracic surgery residents, who are still required to obtain and master a significant amount of subspecialized knowledge and expertise in the field of cardiothoracic surgery, during a relatively short period of time. With the uncertainty surrounding the length of time that hospital operations will be disrupted, we as cardiothoracic surgeons must quickly re-invent the way that we think about and provide surgical education, to ensure that our trainees' needs are being met to the best of our abilities during this unprecedented time.",

Our weekly hour long didactic session has been shifted to a Zoom Conference Meeting. Zoom offers a simple set up for video conferencing that works across various platforms, without requiring that participants have pre-installed software on their available device. The conference was restructured to accommodate the new format. Because we thought a large group discussion could be cumbersome on the digital platform, the structure of this meeting has changed from topicdriven PowerPoint presentations to more accurately simulated \"mock oral\" engagements on one cardiac/congenital and one thoracic topic weekly, while still maintaining overall continuity with the assigned TSDA curriculum. The focus is determined by our residents at the beginning of the week to give them time to prepare for the Thursday session. The day of the didactic session, one cardiac and one thoracic faculty member are tasked with conducting the Zoom Conference to minimize interruption, focus participation, and facilitate a targeted discussion. Both residents join the Zoom session in its entirety to learn from observing their colleague move through the scenarios. At the conclusion of the session, verbal feedback is provided. Additionally, a standardized score card of the trainees' performance on the mock oral is filled out and provided to the program director as well as the trainee for documentation.",

With minimal case volume for our trainees due to operating room restrictions, there is a clear concern about technical decline due to lack of practice during COVID-19. As a result, we have provided each of our trainees with The Chamberelain Group pocket vessel anastomosis simulation kit and have scheduled weekly \"friendly competitions\" with trainees, judged by time to complete anastomosis, quality of anastomosis, and economy of motion as evaluated by a faculty member, who observes the resident performing the simulation via Zoom video conference.

The reorganized didactic programming, now temporarily suspended due to COVID-19, consists of a one-hour didactic session every Thursday morning from 6:30 AM -7:30 AM. During this time, trainees are excused from their clinical obligations, except for extreme emergency situations, in order to facilitate focused educational involvement. All faculty members are required to attend the didactic session. Advanced practice providers, medical students, and rotating resident attendance is encouraged. The program functions on a four week schedule. The topic of focus for the week was determined based on a two year curriculum utilizing the Thoracic Surgery Directors Association (TSDA) Curriculum as a model. The first three of four weeks are facilitated by residents, who prepare case-based PowerPoint presentations that engage participants in a dialogue around the essential concepts and complexities of that week's material. . The fourth week is focused on dedicated American Board of Thoracic Surgery (ABTS) board preparation, with 30 minutes spent performing SESATS questions and 30 minutes engaged in mock oral scenarios with faculty members.",
