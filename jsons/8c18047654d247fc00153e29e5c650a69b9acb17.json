While asymptomatic virus shedders have been suggested to comprise up to ~80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections 6, 7 , data informing these figures are largely confined to cross-sectional reports that cannot distinguish truly asymptomatic cases from those who are pre-symptomatic at the point of testing (see Figure   1 ). Interchangeable use of these concepts, i.e. asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic, precludes accurate estimation of the asymptomatic proportion of potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 infections. Detectible SARS-CoV-2 shedding based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing cannot conclusively establish infectiousness in the absence of viral culture 8 9 . However, PCR cycle threshold values provide an informative estimate of viral load and, by extension, probable infectiousness 8 ; consequently, PCRconfirmed infection can provide a useful and accessible indicator of potentially infectious cases, including those without symptoms, for epidemiological modelling.",

We limited the review to include studies from community settings rather than hospitals and other medical facilities to prevent selection bias towards symptomatic cases. Only studies reporting PCR-confirmed cases rather than exclusive serological studies were included to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with viral shedding. The review was not extended to estimate the overall asymptomatic proportion including nonshedding serological cases due to the limited number of serological studies, varying interpretation, and ongoing development of valid serological assays for SARS-CoV-2.",

The asymptomatic proportion is given as the number of consistently asymptomatic confirmed cases over the total number of PCR-confirmed cases who received follow-up ( Figure 2 ). It is important to note that the term asymptomatic proportion is sometimes used to alternatively refer to the asymptomatic proportion of all infections including those that do not shed virus and would not be PCR-confirmed (see Figure 2 ).

Based on random-effects meta-analysis indicated to be the most heterogeneous study -was the only study to systematically test participants using multiple specimen types (baseline saliva specimens and daily nasopharyngeal swabs) and appears to have the highest detection sensitivity for positive cases. This study was also, however, the most affected by potential non-participation bias, as 39% of PCR-confirmed cases chose not to participate in the symptom monitoring. This led to a moderate risk of bias score whereas all other studies were assessed as low overall risk of bias. ",

These findings do not support claims 6,7 of a very high asymptomatic proportion for PCR-confirmed infections (up to 80%) and highlights the importance of distinguishing between asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases. The careful screening of study design and methodology done as part of this review was reflected in the overall low risk of bias on assessed criteria for all but one included study. An additional strength of our review is the systematic search of both peerreviewed published literature and preprint studies which has enabled us to capture the most up to date estimates available.",

Only three of the six included studies 15, 16, 19 described the full range of symptoms included within their symptomatic case definitions, while a further two studies 17, 17, 18 reported details of symptoms endorsed by participants but did not specify whether additional symptoms were assessed as part of their case definitions. While a similar range of symptoms appear to have been monitored/endorsed across included studies, it is possible that symptomatic case identification may have been affected by reporting bias and consequently that the true proportion of symptomatic cases was underestimated. This is particularly relevant given that unusual symptoms such as dysosmia/anosmia -only explicitly investigated by one study 17, 18 -and dysgeusia/ageusia -not referred to in any included study -may be the primary or sole symptom for some COVID-19 cases [22] [23] [24] . Demographic reporting across studies was also limited and it was not possible to stratify findings by age and sex. Estimates of the asymptomatic proportion may vary across population subgroups and this is a relevant area for future enquiry.",

Virological evidence suggests that infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be isolated by viral culture from samples with cycle threshold values up to 33, though the proportion of infectious virus decreases at higher cycle threshold values (i.e. lower viral load) 20 . While median baseline cycle threshold values for all symptom status groups (23.1-25.5) reported by Arons et al.(2020) 14 fell well within this limit, infectious virus was isolated from only 33% of asymptomatic baseline samples, compared to 71% of pre-symptomatic and 65% of symptomatic samples. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the very small sample of asymptomatic specimens (n=3). Overall, clear reporting of cycle threshold values across follow-up by symptom status was lacking in included studies. This is an important area for further research given that the degree and duration of the infectious period for asymptomatic cases, as well as the overall proportion of virus-shedding cases that are asymptomatic, influence the contribution of asymptomatic cases to SARS-CoV-2 transmission at a population level. Further inquiry into the degree of preclinical shedding for pre-symptomatic cases, although not the focus of this review, is similarly warranted. The contribution of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases to the overall spread of infection cannot be accurately inferred in the absence of high-quality evidence assessing the infectiousness of such cases21 .",

The symptomatic case trajectory comprises a period of pre-clinical virus shedding, in which the individual demonstrates no symptoms but tests PCR positive (pre-symptomatic PCR-confirmed). These individuals subsequently develop symptoms and continue to shed virus (symptomatic PCR-confirmed). Consequently, cases with a symptomatic trajectory may appear to be asymptomatic if tested in the pre-clinical shedding period and not followed-up. Asymptomatic cases with viral shedding, conversely, test PCR positive and never go on to develop symptoms across the course of infection (asymptomatic PCR-confirmed).",
