The average volume consumed (midgut and crop) by \u00dfies starved for 24 h was 3.88 l by feeding both sexes on a sucrose phosphate glutamate buffer. In addition, various volumes of a solution (0.125 M sucrose plus Amaranth dye) were fed to 3-d-old adult female house \u00dfies to quantify the crop contraction rate as affected by crop volume. As crop volume increased, the contraction rate increased until it reached a peak at 2 l, after which it declined. It is hypothesized that the high contraction rate of the crop, which in house \u00dfy is almost twice the rate of three other \u00dfy species, is one of the factors that makes house \u00dfy an excellent vector. The mechanism for such a high contraction rate needs to be investigated.",

            "text": "The crop is a diverticulated foregut organ whose duct enters the foregut just before food entering the cardia or proventriculus, which then leads into the midgut. The transport of food in and out of the crop is facilitated by coordinated contractions of visceral muscles that surround the crop cuticle in the form of general peristalsis or contractions involving both the crop lobes\u00d0pumps and the opening and closing of valve-like sphincters in the crop duct (Thomson and Holling 1975a) . \"Proper crop function depends on muscle relaxation during food ingestion and rhythmic muscle contractions to push food back into the midgut for digestion and absorption\" (Haselton et al. 2004) , which is why the number of contractions in the crop is so important. In addition, both crop contractions and volume are essential for the \u00dfy to perform \"bubbling\" behavior, which is when the crop contracts pushing the crop contents out onto the proboscis tip in the form of a droplet (i.e., not a true bubble; Stoffolano et al. 2008) . Unlike blood-feeding Diptera, which get rid of excess water in the bloodmeal via the anus, nonblood-feeding \u00dfies get rid of excess water in their meal through \"bubbling\"\u00d5 behavior (Hendrich et al. 1992) . Most \u00dfies reingest this droplet and some share it with the female as a nuptial gift (Stoffolano and Haselton 2013) , but some like Bactrocera tyroni (Froggatt) (Coronado-Gonzalez et al. 2008 ) and house \u00dfy generally deposit the droplet on the substrate, which in the house \u00dfy literature (Greenberg 1973 ) is recorded as a vomit spot (i.e., really regurgitant as it only comes from the crop and not the midgut).",

Because Chlamydia is maintained in a SPG buffer, it was necessary for future vector competence studies to determine how much of the SPG adults would ingest. To ensure that the \u00dfies would consume the SPG, they were starved for 24 h before the experiment. Unlike the previous experiment, 25 \u00dfies of both sexes were used. Each \u00dfy was individually cold-anesthetized (2\u00d0 4 min) and placed into its own cup and numbered.

Flies were cold-anesthetized (2\u00d0 4 min) and placed on ice before weighing. After each \u00dfy was initially weighed and individually placed into a separate cup, a small piece of the SPG-soaked cotton wick was placed into the cup.

The consumption volume information produced in this study is essential for future studies aimed at determining the crop involvement in house \u00dfy possibly serving either as a vector of C. trachomatis or being used as a model system in those areas where M. sorbens is not available. Even though Miller et al. (2004) showed that M. sorbens is a vector of the pathogen, no studies have identi\u00deed the \u00dfy crop as a source for pathogen storage and involvement or tested whether house \u00dfy is also a suitable vector. The ingested volume of SPG in adult M. domestica reported in this study is about the same volume used to infect house \u00dfies with other pathogens (McGaughey and Nayduch 2009). Our study also suggests that the volume of SPG ingested may be dependent on the size of the \u00dfy, and the variance in Fig. 2 may also be because of sex difference, which was not considered in this study. However, future studies with a larger sample size and sorting by sex may provide a better estimate of the relationship between size and of individual \u00dfies and the volume of SPG ingested. Root (1921) showed that house \u00dfy starved for 17 h had an average intake of 3.9 l, while those starved for 21 h consumed 6.6 l (i.e., both values are within the range of values determined for \u00dfies in this study).",

            "text": "Transmission. The effect of volume on crop muscle contraction rate for house \u00dfy (Fig. 1) follows a similar pattern as that shown by Thomson (1975) for P. regina, but with house \u00dfy having a considerably smaller crop capacity, and twice the contraction rate. A comparison of crop contraction rates (ccr) per minute for four species of \u00dfies (Protophormia terraenovae (Robineau-Desvoidy): 57\u00d0 62 ccr, Stoffolano laboratory (J.G.S., unpublished); Drosophila melanogaster Meigen: 47 ccr, Kaminski et al. 2002; and P. regina: 49 \u00d051 ccr, Thomson 1975, Liscia et al. 2012 ) determined at the maximum crop volume and giving the highest contraction rate reveals that house \u00dfy has almost twice the adult crop contraction rate (89 \u00d092 ccr, Haselton et al. 2004 and this study) as the other \u00dfies. Thomson and Holling (1975b) demonstrated that crop contraction rate was positively correlated with crop emptying (i.e., in this case regurgitation or \"bubbling\"). House \u00dfy is reported to produce many more regurgitant spots compared with fecal spots (Graham-Smith, 1914, p. 84 ) and this suggests that regurgitation rates are sig-ni\u00decantly higher than fecal deposition rates. Coast (2004) reported that only 3% of the water loss in house \u00dfy adults is due to excretion. In personal correspondence with him (2014), Coast stated \"What I referred to as losses via salivation may correspond to regurgitation of the crop contents, but this had only a minor role to play in total water loss, which was mainly via the cuticle and spiracles. Noninjected control \u00dfies very rarely void any urine or \u00d4saliva,\u00d5 and evaporative losses via the cuticle and respiratory system account for virtually all water loss. Control \u00dfies were given free access to water and sugar.\" Based on his results, one can conclude that house \u00dfy adults excrete (i.e., which does not include regurgitant) considerably less than one would think (i.e., 3% total for excretion based on his article). We propose that this difference between regurgitation and fecal rates could help explain the signi\u00decance of adult house \u00dfies in the oral transmission pathway versus the fecal pathway for certain pathogens. Whether this applies to other \u00dfies needs to be investigated.",
