Originally used to describe an unusual presentation of pneumonia, the term has since evolved to become much broader in meaning. Atypical pneumonia is now more widely used in reference to either pneumonia caused by a relatively common group of pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae), or to a distinct clinical syndrome the existence of which is difficult to demonstrate. As such, the term atypical pneumonia as most widely used today is often inaccurate, potentially confusing, of dubious scientific merit, and unhelpful.",

            "text": "The first reference to atypical pneumonia is unknown, although the term was clearly developed at a time when knowledge of the microbial causes of pneumonia extended little beyond the pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) and the tubercule bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Medical writings from the late 19th century make no specific mention of this syndrome,1, 2, 3, 4 but there are several references to the term in subsequent decades. Although a 1938 paper by Hobart Reimann,5 a Philadelphia physician, clearly popularised the concept (figure\n), many others had made reference to atypical pneumonia in earlier years. Nothnagel's Encylopedia of Practical Medicine6 from 1903 refers to cases of atypical pneumonia. In 1910, the British Medical Journal reported that Sir John Broadbent7 read a paper on atypical pneumonia to the Medical Society of London, and Thomas Oliver8 made a passing reference to atypical pneumonias in his lecture to the York Medical Society. In 1911, Jay Perkins9 devoted a whole article to the topic. He defined atypical pneumonia as those cases of pneumonia for which a specific causative organism was unknown, and noted the variable features and irregular clinical course of this disease. Thomas Hastings and Walter Niles10 in their 1911 paper on sputum bacteriology, Percy Kidd11 in his 1912 Lumleian lectures to the Royal College of Physicians of London, and Ernest Glynn12 in his 1913 description of epidemic pneumonia use the term to refer to a diverse group of pneumonias that differ from the ordinary. In the 1920s and 1930s, atypical pneumonia had become a more accepted term and appeared in a several reports of unusual pneumonia syndromes.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\n",

During periods of the 1940s, atypical pneumonia was reported as being almost continuously present in the large army post at Fort Bragg, NC, USA.20 There was a high incidence among new recruits, with the first 4 weeks of army life being particularly noted for increased susceptibility to respiratory diseases. Outbreaks of atypical pneumonia were also described among military personnel from other regions of the world.21, 22, 23, 24 Clinicians recognised that atypical pneumonia had diverse causes rather than a single cause. However, there were many descriptions of clusters of atypical pneumonia syndrome among military recruits. Each cluster probably represented an outbreak caused by a single pathogen, and many were likely to have been due to M pneumoniae. Indeed, this was confirmed by retrospective testing of stored sera from some patients with primary atypical pneumonia from Fort Bragg.25 Descriptions of these outbreaks gave credence to the concept of a distinct atypical pneumonia syndrome and the vigorous adoption of the term by some authorities.20, 26, 27\n",

Pneumococci were isolated from half of these patients, mostly by inoculation of sputum into mice. However, a few patients had pneumococci detected in their sputum by direct examination with the quellung technique, and no patient had a positive blood culture. Of the pneumococcal isolates, none belonged to serotypes 1 or 2 that were most commonly associated at the time with lobar pneumonia and severe disease.

Although psittacosis (now known to be caused by Chlamydophila psittaci) was first described in 188030 and was well-recognised by the 1930s,31, 32, 33 pneumonia caused by Chlamydophila pneumoniae was first recognised much later. Originally referred to as the TWAR strain, C pneumoniae became recognised as a cause of pneumonia in the 1980s34, 35, 36, 37 and was designated as a new species in 1989.38 An outbreak of pneumonia among delegates to an American Legion convention in Philadelphia, PA, USA, in 1976 first brought legionnaires' disease to the world's attention.39, 40 Subsequently, Legionella spp were recognised as important causes of both sporadic and epidemic pneumonia around the world.",

To further complicate matters, no clear definition exists of exactly which microorganisms are the so-called atypical pneumonia pathogens. Some lists are extensive, and include most non-pneumococcal pathogens associated with pneumonia, including respiratory viruses and agents of bioterrorism.41, 42, 43 However, for many clinicians today, the atypical pneumonia pathogens comprise only M pneumoniae, Legionella spp, C pneumoniae, and, occasionally, C psittaci. More than any other pathogens, these organisms have become firmly linked to the concept of atypical pneumonia. A review of publications on PubMed from the past 10 years (January, 1999, to January, 2009) that have \u201catypical pneumonia\u201d in their titles, abstracts, or both, showed that 90 (30%) of 302 focused specifically on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 79 of 302 (26%) used this term to refer to pneumonia caused by M pneumoniae, Legionella spp, and Chlamydophila spp only, and the remainder used the term in reference to a non-specific atypical pneumonia syndrome. An additional 187 articles over the same period referred to \u201catypical pathogens\u201d, usually in reference to M pneumoniae, Legionella spp, and Chlamydophila spp only.",

Even Reimann,44, 45, 46, 47 whose 1938 article popularised the adjective atypical, consistently substituted \u201cviral\u201d for \u201catypical\u201d in subsequent years, because he believed the former was more accurate. J D Adamson and R E Beamish48 in 1947 deplored reference to atypical pneumonia, and highlighted the protean nature of the syndrome. They also suggested how primary atypical pneumonia could be further divided into nine subclassifications: common cold pneumonitis, influenzal pneumonitis, contamination pneumonitis, exacerbation pneumonitis, atelectatic pneumonitis, allergic pneumonitis, pneumonitis due to known viruses and rickettsias, pneumonitis due to unknown viruses, and miscellaneous. In the early 1950s, S P Bedson49 and Philip Robertson and Forgan Morle50 emphasised the inconsistent clinical picture and diverse causes as reasons to discourage use of the term. The latter authors went as far as to state that they \u201cwish to dispel much of the mysticism associated with this group of conditions and to destroy the concept of atypical pneumonia as at present described\u201d.50 Unable to distinguish atypical from typical pneumonia on the basis of clinical or radiographic features in the late 1980s, Guo-Dong Fang and colleagues51 believed that the usefulness of this classification had been rendered obsolete, and recommended abandoning the term atypical pneumonia and focusing instead on the specific cause. More recently, George Sarosi52 submitted in a monograph dedicated to this topic that atypical pneumonia \u201chas no meaning in current medical practice and that we should get rid of it\u201d.",

Perhaps more importantly, reference to atypical coverage assumes that any perceived benefit of this therapy is because of treatment of atypical pathogens, despite the lack of microbiological evidence to support this concept. This obscures the fact that benefits might result from the antibiotics themselves rather than the involvement of specific pneumonia pathogens.112, 113 Recent data from a mouse study suggest that improved outcomes for pneumonia treated with protein synthesis inhibitors over pneumonia treated with \u03b2-lactams might be related to suppression of the inflammatory response.114\n",

Nevertheless, the British Thoracic Society guidelines conclude that the term \u201catypical pathogens\u201d remains useful to clinicians in guiding discussion about infectious cause and management of community-acquired pneumonia.110 As a consequence the adjective atypical, for which there is no agreed definition, is retained and remains linked to pneumonia by association tending to perpetuate the notion of atypical pneumonia.",

These are common pneumonia pathogens that have their own characteristic features, and we should cease trying to convince ourselves that unrelated pathogens cause a unified and distinct pneumonia syndrome. We should recognise that the term atypical pathogen has provided a useful shorthand for a diagnostic approach based on Gram stains and culture on agar plates, but this does not justify its continued use when diagnostic techniques have moved beyond these methods. The term might seem useful to clinicians for discussions on treatment and cause, but, because no agreement exists on a definition of the causative organism, this use will cause ongoing confusion. Writers of textbooks and reviews should abandon the current popular use of atypical pneumonia, which is largely still included through tradition only and refrain from using the term atypical pathogens as it lacks definition. Appropriate use would avoid some of the current confusion and misconceptions around a potentially useful term.",
