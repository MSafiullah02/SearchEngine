If R 01 is above unity and R 02 is below unity, the disease persists in the first patch provided S 1* 2 < S 2* 2 . If R 02 is above unity, R 01 is below unity, and S 2* 1 < S 1* 1 , the disease persists in the second patch. And if R 01 and R 02 are above unity, and further S 1* 2 > S 2* 2 and S 2* 1 > S 1* 1 are satisfied, the unique endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable by constructing the Lyapunov function.

The disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease ultimately dies out by applying the comparison principle of cooperative systems if the basic reproduction numbers both R \uf639\uf6dc and R \uf639\uf63a are below unity.

The equality holds if and only if x = z = \uf6dc. That is, when S \uf6dc = S ** \uf6dc and S \uf63a = S ** \uf63a , dV /dt| (\uf6dc) = \uf639. By using the LaSalle invariant principle [\uf640], the endemic equilibrium P ** is globally asymptotically stable.Theorems \uf63c.\uf6dc-\uf63c.\uf63c can be summarized in Figure \uf63a . The basic reproduction numbers R \uf639\uf6dc and R \uf639\uf63a are two important threshold parameters. It shows that if both R \uf639\uf6dc and R \uf639\uf63a are less than one, the disease-free equilibrium P \uf639 is globally asymptotically stable and the disease eventually dies out (the region I in Figure \uf63a) ; if R \uf639\uf6dc is greater than one, R \uf639\uf63a is less than one, and S \uf6dc* \uf63a < S \uf63a* \uf63a , the boundary equilibrium P \uf6dc* is locally stable and the disease persists in patch one but can be eradicated in patch two (the region II in Figure \uf63a) ; if R \uf639\uf63a is greater than one, R \uf639\uf6dc is less than one, and S \uf63a* \uf6dc < S \uf6dc* \uf6dc , the boundary equilibrium P \uf63a* is locally stable and the disease persists in patch two but can be eradicated in patch one (the region III in Figure \uf63a) ; and if R \uf639\uf6dc > \uf6dc, R \uf639\uf63a > \uf6dc, S \uf6dc* \uf63a > S \uf63a* \uf63a , and S \uf63a* \uf6dc > S \uf6dc* \uf6dc , there is exactly one endemic equi-",
