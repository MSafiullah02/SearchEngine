Strategies for the detection of a novel agent included the use of direct electron microscopy on respiratory specimens, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung tissue obtained from lung biopsy or necropsy, culture in cell lines known to support respiratory viral infection (and subsequently on other types of cells), PCR and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with consensus primers for respiratory viral pathogens, and random-primer RT-PCR methods. Serology was used for the detection of agents antigenically related to known respiratory pathogens. One of the problems faced in this investigation was the differentiation of SARS from more routine causes of atypical pneumonia. The one feature supporting the probable diagnosis of SARS was epidemiological linkage to a cluster of similar disease cases. Substantial numbers of such cases were initially present in Guangzhou, at the hospital outbreaks at Hanoi and at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, and subsequently in Toronto and Singapore. Through global case notification, a suspected case from Singapore was also intercepted on a flight arriving in Frankfurt, Germany.17\n",

In addition, the genetic sequence of the human metapneumovirus isolated from these patients was essentially similar to that previously known to circulate in human beings. As such, it was difficult to explain why human metapneumovirus, which was known to have been a human pathogen for many years, would cause a novel and unusual disease syndrome such as SARS. Rhinovirus and chlamydia were also detected in patients with suspected SARS.10, 17, 20\n",

Although culture in cell lines (including Hep-2, MRC-5, MDCK, LLC-Mk2, HeLa, RDE, NCI-H292, HUT-292, B95-8, and A549) that were usually used to culture respiratory viruses proved unproductive, the virus was isolated in Vero-E6 cells in two laboratories and FRhK-4 cells in the other. Even before the nature of the virus was identified, a link with SARS was established by showing that serum samples from patients with suspected SARS had increasing antibody titres to virus-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). The identification of the agent as a coronavirus was made using thin-section electron microscopy of virus-infected cells and negatively stained preparations of cell-culture supernatants that were virus infected (Figure 1\n). Independent confirmation of the identity of the virus was obtained by sequencing fragments of the viral genome derived through random-primed RT-PCR in two laboratories, and the use of consensus primers for coronaviruses in the other laboratory. In all three laboratories, the region that yielded the early sequence information was the open reading frame (ORF) 1b region of the replicase gene, possibly because this is a highly conserved region of the virus. DNA array analysis using a microarray containing probes for various virus families21 was done on infected and uninfected cells. This analysis gave positive signals for a group of eight oligonucleotides whose sequence was derived from two virus families, the Coronaviridae and the Astroviridae.20 However, microarray analysis could only be done once the virus was isolated in culture and could not be done directly on the clinical specimen.",

However, to conclusively establish a causal role for this novel coronavirus, the virus had to be consistently found in the relevant clinical specimens from patients with the disease and not in healthy controls. RT-PCR methods based on the initial genetic sequence of the virus replicase gene were designed and applied to detect viral RNA in patients' specimens. The virus isolate was also used in IIFAs and EIAs to detect serological responses in acute and convalescent serum specimens. With these approaches, infection with the novel coronavirus, subsequently named SARS-associated coronavirus, was detectable in 45 of 50 consecutive patients with clinically suspected SARS in Hong Kong. All 32 patients from whom paired serum samples were available had seroconverted to positive for SARS coronavirus. Viral RNA was not detectable by RT-PCR in healthy controls. Serum samples from 200 healthy blood donors in Hong Kong, even though there was an outbreak of SARS at the time, did not have antibody that was reactive to cells infected with SARS coronavirus in IIFAs.14 A second study found evidence of SARS coronavirus by RT-PCR or virus culture in 19 patients with SARS from Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and nine patients from whom serum samples were available had increasing antibody titres to the virus.20 Furthermore, 384 randomly selected serum samples from US blood donors had no reactivity to the SARS coronavirus by EIA.20 A third study found all five patients with probable SARS and three of 13 patients with suspected SARS who originated from Singapore and Vietnam to have evidence of SARS coronavirus RNA by RT-PCR.17 Taken together, these results indicated that the novel coronavirus was associated with SARS, and given the lack of serological reactivity in human beings, suggested that it was probably recently introduced to the human population. Because, on the basis of the partial genetic information available, the virus seemed to be an agent not previously known to circulate in human populations, the likely origin of the virus was from an animal source.",

Infection of cynomolgous macaques with an isolate of SARS coronavirus led to disease that was pathologically similar to that seen in human patients with SARS, with epithelial necrosis, serosanguinous alveolar exudates, hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.28, 29 The virus was successfully re-isolated from these lesions and an antibody response to the virus was shown in the infected animals. By contrast, infection of macaques with human metapneumovirus produced a mild suppurative rhinitis with minimal erosion in the infected airways.28 The possibility remained that co-infection with human metapneumovirus could exacerbate the disease caused by SARS coronavirus. However, there was no evidence of human metapneumovirus infection (by RT-PCR or serological methods) in patients with severe and fatal SARS. SARS coronavirus was detected in these patients, which suggested that human metapneumovirus was not necessary for development of severe or fatal SARS.23 In addition, infection of macaques with SARS coronavirus followed by human metapneumovirus did not produce enhanced disease.28 Thus, it was concluded that SARS coronavirus was both necessary and sufficient to cause the full syndrome of SARS. Subsequently, it was shown that SARS coronavirus infects and replicates in cats and ferrets, and can be transmitted to uninfected animals.30 Recently, SARS coronavirus has also been shown to infect and replicate in mice, although without overt disease.31 These experiments provide alternative animal models for the investigation of SARS. Of these, the macaque and ferret models show clinically significant disease.",

Whereas bioengineered or even extraterrestrial agents were adduced by some to explain its origin,40 the most probable explanation was that it was an animal virus that had recently acquired the ability for human-human transmission. This hypothesis was strengthened by reports that early patients with SARS in Guangdong were exposed to live wild game animals held in markets serving the restaurant trade for freshly cooked game meat.5, 7 A search for the animal source of the precursor virus was prompted (Figure 2\n). Sampling of several animal species found in one of the live-game markets in Guangdong revealed that some of them carried a virus genetically and antigenically related to the human SARS coronavirus.41 In particular, a SARS-like coronavirus was detected by RT-PCR in the nasal and faecal swabs of civet cats (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Serological evidence of infection was found in these species and also in a Chinese ferret-badger (Melogale moschata).41 Genetic sequencing of the virus revealed that the animal coronavirus had more than 99% homology with human SARS coronavirus (Figure 3\n). However, when compared with the animal viruses, the human SARS coronavirus seemed to have a 29-nucleotide deletion in ORF8 (Figure 4\n). This additional sequence predicts that the animal virus will express a putative protein of 122 aminoacids that is not seen in the human SARS coronavirus. Interestingly, a subsequent study revealed other genotypes with similar deletions in the same ORF.42 In that study, viruses with a 82-nucleotide deletion were isolated from the early phase of the epidemic. In addition, viruses with a 415-nucleotide deletion resulting in the loss of the whole ORF8 region were found in May, 2003 (ie, at the late phase of the outbreak). These results indicated that the expression of ORF8 is dispensable for the SARS coronavirus in human beings. Alternatively, it is also tempting to speculate that deletions in ORF8 might give the virus an advantage to adaptation in human beings.",

The early viruses were found to be genetically more diverse and more prone to mutation than viruses isolated later in the course of the outbreak, which suggests that the SARS coronavirus was in the process of host adaptation and was subjected to a high selection pressure during the early phase of the outbreak.42 Later in the outbreak, the virus had presumably become more adapted to human-human transmission and one lineage of the virus had become dominant. For example, in Feb-March, 2003, there were at least four introductions of SARS coronavirus from China to Hong Kong.46 These were genetically diverse. However, both classic and molecular epidemiology suggests that only one of these viruses seems to have given rise to the major outbreak in Hong Kong that subsequently spread globally. Thus, most of the SARS coronaviruses isolated from patients in Canada, Vietnam, and Singapore are genetically closely related to the virus isolated from a single SARS patient in Hong Kong (HKU-33), whereas other genetic lineages seem to be less transmissible.42, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50\n",

Virus was detected by RT-PCR and by culture not only in the respiratory tract but also in the faeces and urine.51 Replication of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract was confirmed by electron microscopic studies of biopsies of the upper and lower intestinal mucosa in patients with SARS.56 These findings suggested that infection with SARS coronavirus was disseminated and not simply confined to the respiratory tract. They also raised the possibility that the infection could be spread by the faecal route. This route proved to be important in at least one major community outbreak, Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong, in which over 300 patients were infected within the period of a few days, presumably through contaminated faeces.57 Quantitative RT-PCR assays on the nasopharyngeal aspirates as well as rates of positivity of first-generation RT-PCR assays at different stages of the illness showed that, unlike other respiratory viral infections, viral load and rates of positivity of SARS coronavirus in the upper respiratory tract increased progressively to peak at around day 10 after disease onset.51, 53, 54, 55, 58 These findings provided the reason why RT-PCR assays were of poor sensitivity early in the course of the disease. They also predicted that virus transmission would be lower in the first few days of illness, a finding supported by epidemiological observations.59 Whereas viral RNA could be detected by RT-PCR for many weeks or even months after the onset of disease, virus culture was only possible during the first 3 weeks of illness.51 It is possible that even though virus replication continues after the first 3 weeks of disease, the virus may be complexed with antibody and therefore no longer infective or transmissible. This finding was also in agreement with epidemiological findings.",

More importantly, the technology, when combined with automated specimen extraction methods, had the potential to become high throughput assays, a significant advantage in areas with outbreaks of SARS in which large numbers of specimens had to be tested. In addition, these assays provided quantitative viral load data, which helped elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease. For example, these assays showed that viral load was highest in specimens of the lower respiratory tract (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, endotracheal aspirates), and was higher in nasopharyngeal aspirate than in throat swabs.17 Faecal samples had very high viral loads toward the end of the first week of illness, and were the specimen of choice during the second week of disease.66\n",

Nevertheless, blood leucocytes may provide yet another alternative for early SARS diagnosis.

Recently, this hypothesis has been confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR, and high viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate was found to be an independent predictor of mortality. Viral load from patients who died from the disease was recently shown to be about 4\u00b75 log higher than in patients who eventually recovered from the illness.78 A high viral load is also associated with the occurrence of diarrhoea78 and the requirement for intensive care.70 Thus, quantitative PCR assays might provide critical prognostic information for clinical management.

IIFA using virus-infected cells spotted onto Teflon-coated microwell slides,51 or EIA based on extracts of virus-infected cells coated on microwell EIA plates have proved reliable methods for the diagnosis of SARS.79 However, seroconversion usually occurred in weeks 2 or 3 of illness, and a few patients seroconverted as late as 28 days after disease onset.58 Thus, serology is not an option for early diagnosis of the disease. Detection of IgM or IgA subclass-specific antibody did not allow earlier diagnosis.58, 80 These tests require culture of live SARS coronavirus to provide the relevant antigen used in the assays, and require reliable inactivation of virus infectivity before they can be used outside biohazard level 3 containment. Recombinant viral nucleoprotein and spike protein antigens expressed in Escherichia coli and other substrates have been assessed as alternative serological test platforms.79, 81, 82 These have the potential for providing low cost, reproducible, and non-hazardous serological tests in an EIA format that is amenable to high throughput testing.79, 83, 84 However, it should be borne in mind that each antigen and assay format must be individually tested to assess the possibility of cross-reaction with other related human coronaviruses. Whereas such serological cross-reactions did not prove to be a major problem with the whole native viral antigen assays mentioned above, this should not be assumed to mean that recombinant antigens are equally specific until they have been shown to be so. Furthermore, although serological cross-reactivity proved not be a problem during the period of the SARS outbreak, in the post-SARS era when the prior probability of SARS is extremely low, a positive serological result must be treated with even greater caution. In addition to the two known human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, a new human coronavirus has been discovered.85 The possibility of cross-reaction with other human coronaviruses, although rare, is real and must be taken seriously. Furthermore, individuals vary in the antigenic epitopes to which they produce antibodies. Hence, cross-reactivity may well be a rare event, although such a result, if not interpreted with care, may have major implications for public health. We therefore suggest that all positive serological results should be confirmed by neutralisation tests in reference laboratories.",

Positive RT-PCR results should be confirmed by an independent molecular test on a different specimen. RT-PCR tests for different genome targets (eg, replicase gene and nucleoprotein gene) should be available in reference laboratories to confirm positive results, and for selective use in confirming negative results on patients on whom there is a high degree of suspicion. Serial specimens from many sites (eg, respiratory, faeces, and serum) should be tested. In addition, to avoid obtaining false-negative results, assays with internal PCR inhibitor control should be encouraged. Positive results should be confirmed in an independent reference laboratory. Serological assays should show a significant rise in antibody titres to native viral antigens (eg, IIFA) and be confirmed by virus neutralisation. Human infection with an animal SARS-like coronavirus, which is what we are most likely to encounter, may behave atypically compared with SARS. For example, the clinical disease may be milder and the viral load may be even lower and more transient than with SARS. This means even greater vigilance may be required in making the diagnosis of a infection with the SARS-related animal coronavirus.",

There is at present no evidence for the virus persisting in the human population. Although the virus may be detected by RT-PCR in the faeces for months after the onset of disease,51 virus isolation is rarely possible after the third week of illness, and there is no evidence for disease transmission by patients in late convalescence. The possibility that immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS, may harbour the virus long term has to be considered. However, if epidemiologically relevant transmission from such cases occurred, SARS should have been manifest by now, given the intense global surveillance and awareness that now exists. Escape of the virus from a laboratory has indeed occurred on three occasions86 and highlights the importance of biosafety. WHO has provided strict biohazard guidelines for the handling of this virus and its secure storage.87 At least one of these events involved the handling of virus that was thought to be chemically inactivated.86, 88 Thus, researchers should use appropriate and internationally accepted methods for the inactivation of live viruses.89 A detailed study on SARS-coronavirus inactivation has been recently reported.90 To prevent any inadvertent laboratory-acquired infection leading to secondary transmission in the community, as happened after the laboratory infections in Beijing,88 a high level of alert for febrile and respiratory illness in all laboratory workers who handle infectious SARS coronavirus needs to be maintained.",
