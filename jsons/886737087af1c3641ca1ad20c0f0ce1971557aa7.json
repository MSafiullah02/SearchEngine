            "text": "The advent of molecular diagnostics has allowed the investigation of the airborne transmission pathway to progress significantly in the past 10-12 years, since the 2003 outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Much of this progress has been driven by researchers in some of the most affected countries, namely Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada. Perhaps equally inspiring is that the researchers who have produced this wealth of new data have come from several different, traditionally quite separate disciplines and teams, including engineering, epidemiology, public health, hospital physicians, and infection control teams.",

            "text": "At the time of writing, the current number of people infected by Ebola virus in the ongoing West African outbreak is estimated to be 15351, with 9596 laboratory confirmed and 5459 deaths (CDC, 2014) . Concerns about the potential for possible airborne transmission of Ebola virus have been expressed in a detailed online commentary (CIDRAP, 2014b) , and a similar one has been published regarding a recently emerged, novel respiratory virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (CIDRAP, 2014a) . The authors of these commentaries, particularly in the one on Ebola, have urged for a new approach to assessing the potential 'aerosol transmissible' capability of infectious agents produced by human respiratory activities performed by infected patients, and not to rely on assessments based on older, outdated experimental data. These authors almost certainly refer to the various, modern, technical advances in both pathogen detection as well as airflow visualization that have had a major impact on how the more modern studies have been conducted, which clearly separates them from the older, traditional studies. In particular, in diagnostic testing, using molecular methods (such as the polymerase chain reaction -PCRas well as DNA sequencing), have allowed the detection of fewer and fewer organisms in both clinical and environmental samples which do not necessarily have to be viable at the point of testing (like those obtained by air sampling), which has altered how indoor air quality studies are now performed, and perhaps our awareness of the richness and variety of the organisms in the air around us (Blachere et al., 2009; Booth et al., 2005; Gangneux et al., 2006; Knibbs et al., 2014; Suzuki et al., 2004) .",

In addition, this level of sensitivity in the pathogen detection method raises some double-edged concerns. Although such sensitive assays can allow us to detect naturally occurring infectious agents earlier and at much lower concentrations, which may improve the assessment of ventilation and containment efficacy (at least in a hospital infection control setting), this needs to be balanced against whether such low levels of the pathogen are actually clinically relevant, and the level of clinical relevance will depend on the specific patient population, for example immunocompetent vs. immunocompromised, pediatric vs. adult, and hospitalized vs. community patients.",

These data give us an idea of the type and number of organisms (or at least the viral or bacterial RNA/DNA copies/ml collection fluid) present in the 'airborne' environment, that is the ambient air from which people inhale, with the potential risk of inhaling an airborne respiratory pathogen that could lead to infection and disease. Although most of these data are in the form of nucleic acid detection, a few have also cultured live pathogens from air samples (particularly influenza).",

Although many modeling and experimental studies have tried, the validation of such estimates is difficult and the results from such studies can be inaccurate at best and misleading at worst. Conclusions drawn from such imperfect studies are often used by public health teams to estimate potential incidence rates and therefore to guide their preventative and/or interventional policies, for example, the tough criticism of the WHO regarding recommendations to stockpile the anti-influenza drug, oseltamivir ('Tamiflu'), in response to early fears of a much more severe 2009 H1N1 pandemic (BMJ, 2014) .",

In fact, the difference in viral loads is of the order of several log 10 lower in the airborne droplet compared to the diagnostic oral swab, when the samples are taken from the same patient, within minutes to hours of each other. This is an intriguing finding and requires further confirmation, but, if confirmed, suggests that just using the diagnostic viral load, normally expressed in viral RNA copies/ml, as a basis to estimate the influenza viral concentration in exhaled droplets of different sizes/volumes, may be misleading.",

Also, there is an accumulating evidence that the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has a preference for infecting the LRT rather than the URT, and diagnostic testing for this virus has given false-negative results on URT samples, where the LRT samples have tested positive (Memish et al., 2014) . Therefore, knowing where different droplet sizes deposit within the human URT and LRT after inhalation may be useful to determine the likelihood of infection and subsequent disease.",

Obviously this is a continuous spectrum. Most recently, new evidence is emerging for some pathogens (particular influenza) that the expelled droplets in such naturally generated aerosols may, in fact, carry far less pathogen than was present in the original infected host compartment (usually the URT/ oropharyngeal cavity). This latter finding needs further confirmation, but if true, it may require a rethink of current infection control concerns and interventions for such pathogens; (3) finally, relatively little work has been done examining the inhalational phenomenon and the relevant infectious doses in this airborne transmission context. However, in a related fieldthat of drug deliverymuch modeling and experimental work has already been performed, examining how to adjust particle sizes, concentrations, and modes of delivery to optimize their deposition and therefore their required effect in the human respiratory tract. Some of these data can be applied to investigations into this final stage of the airborne transmission pathway. Specifically, this may be of relevance if the receptor distribution within the respiratory tract for specific pathogens is known.",

Ideally, endpoint measures should be applied to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in a real-life context, for example any overall reduction in hospital-or workplace-acquired infections. However, due to the variously variable pathogen incubation periods, it is noted that such workplaceacquired infections may be difficult to separate from home-and community-acquired infections, unless carefully controlled 'clinical trial-like' studies are also performed to assess the effectiveness of individual interventions.",
