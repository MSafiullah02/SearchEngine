            "text": "Another issue relates to duration of treatment. For several diseases there are shorter therapeutic courses (e.g. mild to marked hypofractionation) with outcomes very similar to longer courses. It is appropriate in pandemic situations to refuse to deliver long course radiation therapy in these situations (e.g. preoperative therapy of rectal cancer, post-operative therapy of breast cancer, primary treatment of glioblastoma, prostate cancer, or palliative treatment of bone metastases). There may be situations, especially in palliation, where data for a shorter course is not strong, but where shorter course treatments might still be appropriate.",

We have a number of standardized regimens, some of which are based on hard data, but some are based on institutional conventions. Since radiation therapy entails multiple daily clinic visits, it might, even in curative situations, be appropriate to alter the sequencing of treatment and delay radiation therapy visits till the pandemic subsides.",

It may be appropriate to modify therapy to account for the infection as for any severe intercurrent disease. If significant lung tissue is being irradiated, terminating therapy (at least temporarily), might be essential for the patient\u2019s benefit to reduce the risk of radiation-associated pulmonary injury. If treatment is continued, it is obvious that appropriate precautions must be taken to protect staff and other patients. It would be appropriate to treat the patient as the last patient(s) of the day followed by thorough room cleaning.",

Rather, one should strive to have institutional (e.g. cancer hospital-based) and/or departmental policies that can be applied to most situations. However, all clinical scenarios cannot be predicted and analyzed ahead of time, so there needs to be flexibility. In addition, there will be substantial gray areas regarding patient-specific decisions.",

But it is critically important that we follow Kant\u2019s advice to respect the patient\u2019s autonomy. The patient needs to know what is being done and for what reasons. If we are deviating from long-standing norms, this needs to be fully discussed with the patient so that the patient is fully informed. Kant emphasized the importance of the categorical imperative, \u201cAct only according to the maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law\u201d. This \u201cgolden rule\u201d should still hold sway.",
