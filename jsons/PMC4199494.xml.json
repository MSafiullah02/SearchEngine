IFN-\u03bb4 shows similar antiviral activity like IFN-\u03bb3 but as it shows limited secretion it might also act intracellularly, unlike the other IFN-\u03bbs [18]. A compound di-nucleotide exonic variant (rs368234815, \u0394G>TT) in IFNL4 causes a frame-shift of its open reading frame and results in the polymorphic pseudogenization of IFNL4 - the polymorphic loss of IFN-\u03bb4 protein [17]. The existence of IFNL4 was not even computationally predicted because the human reference genome contains the TT allele and lacks the IFNL4 open reading frame [17]. Remarkably, the derived TT allele not only eliminates IFN-\u03bb4, but it also shows the strongest genetic association reported to date with improved spontaneous and treatment-induced HCV clearance [17], [19], [20].",

For the TT allele the largest FST, 0.63, corresponds to Southern Han Chinese (CHS) versus YRI, which places the TT allele in the 0.5% tail of the empirical genomic distribution of CHS-YRI FST (Fig. 3A, Table 1). FST is also in the 0.8% tail of the genomic distribution for the other East Asian populations (CHB, JPT, Fig. 3B and C, Table 1), and in the 4% tail for Europeans (CEU) and one African population, Luhya (LWK) (Table 1, Fig. S1). These results remain significant when other populations were used as background and in continental comparisons, and when the genome-wide distribution was restricted to SNPs with the lowest frequency in Yoruba (Table S3).

Under certain selection models such high differentiation should be accompanied by extended haplotype homozygosity in the populations experiencing selection, but not in other populations. We evaluated such a signature with the cross population extended haplotype homozygosity test [26] (XP-EHH), which was calculated across the genome relative to the Yoruba population. The XP-EHH value for the TT allele is in the 0.5% tail of the empirical distribution for East Asian populations (p = 0.003, 0.005, and 0.003, for CHS, CHB, and JPT, Fig. 3A\u2013C, Table 1), and the signal remains significant when calculated relative to a European population (GBR) and in analyses at the continental level (Table S4). In addition, some non-Asian populations show marginally significant signatures of positive selection too (CEU, PUR, LWK, Table 1, Fig. S1). Similar results were obtained with iHS, a statistic that explores haplotype homozygosity within a single population [27] (Table 1) (although iHS lacks power when population frequency is very high, like in Asia). The unusual allele-specific haplotype homozygosity is evident in Figure 3D, which shows the haplotype structure of the locus in one African, one European, and one East Asian population (for all populations see Fig. S3). We note that FST shows very weak correlation with both XP-EHH and iHS in the genome (r = 0.12 and r = \u22120.08 Spearman rank test, respectively, although the large number of data points makes these weak correlations significant, P-value<2.2e-16). Therefore, the FST and XP-EHH/iHS observations can be considered largely independent.",

Second, of all variants in the IFNL region, rs368234815 shows the strongest genetic association with spontaneous and treatment-induced HCV clearance in African Americans [17], [19]; in Europeans and Asians the strong LD across the region results in comparable associations for many variants [15]\u2013[17], [20], [29] (Table 2, Fig. S2, Fig. S7). Third, of all protein-coding or HCV-associated variants in this locus, rs368234815 shows the strongest combined signatures of positive selection in East Asians (Fig. 3A\u2013C, Fig. S1 and S2, Table 2). Only one other polymorphism (intergenic rs8109886, located upstream of IFNL4, Fig. 4), shows signals of selection comparable to rs368234815 (Fig. S2, Table 2). No function has been ascribed to this variant despite a moderate HCV association that is likely due to linkage to TT [6], [17], [30] (Table 2 and Fig. 4), making it a priori a less likely candidate for selection. Indeed, simulations of the evolutionary process showed that the large frequency change of rs8109886 can be explained by linkage to the TT allele alone (Note S1).",

IFNL4 is located upstream of IFNL3 in a region of moderate LD that is separated from the IFNL1/IFNL2 locus by a recombination hotspot (Fig. S7, Table 2). Manry et al. [21] identified signatures of recent positive selection in all three original IFNL genes (IFNL1-3) but neither IFNL4 nor the rs368234815 variant were known at that time and thus they were not considered. The recombination hotspot breaks LD between the IFNL1/INFL2 locus and the IFNL3/IFNL4 locus (Fig. S7, Table 2), showing that these signatures are in all likelihood independent, as suggested by Manry et al. [21]. There is moderate LD between IFNL4 and IFNL3, with an average r2 between rs368234815 and IFNL3 SNPs of 0.18 in CEU and of 0.44 in CHS (see also Fig. S7). So, the selection signatures in IFNL3 and IFNL4 may not be independent. In fact, the seven SNPs identified by Manry et al. [21] (detailed in Table 2 and Fig. 4) have (1) weaker signatures of selection; (2) unclear functional effects, and (3) weaker association with HCV clearance than the TT allele in Africa (Table 2, Figure 4). Also, those that show some signatures of selection have high to moderate LD with rs368234815 (Table 2), with LD broken mostly by a few recombination events in the ancestral haplotype (Note S1). Taken together, these lines of evidence confirm that IFNL1/2 and IFNL3/IFNL4 have likely been independently targeted by positive selection in recent human history, as suggested by Manry et al.\n[21], and highlight rs368234815 TT as the most likely selected allele in its region.",

This scenario is difficult to reconcile with our observations, because unequivocal signatures of selection are observed only in East Asians but the TT allele is common worldwide. The TT-carrying haplotype harbors the highest genetic diversity in Africa indicating that it arose there before the out-of-Africa dispersion (Note S2, Table S5), a result that is consistent with the IFNL4 haplotype network (Fig. S4). Under SDN, only a model where selection begins weak in Africa and becomes stronger outside of Africa could explain our observations (Fig. 5A). An alternative model is selection from standing variation (SSV), also known as a soft sweep (reviewed in [31]). In this scenario an existing neutral or nearly neutral allele becomes advantageous, for example upon environmental change (Fig. 5A).",

In brief, we match millions of simulations under the different models to a summary of the observed genetic data in the IFNL4 region, and use the best matching simulations for further inferences. Under reasonable assumptions we expect the most realistic selection model to produce the closest simulations to real data, and thus simulations can be used to make inferences about the selective history of the allele [23] including the model of selection and relevant parameters (Note S3). While the method relies on some assumptions (e.g. correct demographic and dominance models) this approach has been shown to be robust and to have high power to recover the correct selection scenario [23]. We assess that we overall have high power to recover the correct model, with 76% of the SSV and 95% of the SDN simulations being assigned correctly under the East Asian demographic model, and 70% of the SSV and 97% of the SDN simulations being assigned correctly under the European demographic model (Note S3). The slight bias observed was considered when interpreting the results. For our analysis we consider three models: neutrality (no selection), selection from a de novo mutation (SDN) and selection from standing variation (SSV) (Fig. 5A).",

Results in Europeans are also consistent with the SDN model, although the weaker signals of selection and the slight bias observed above make these results less conclusive (Table 3, Note S3, Fig. S5, Table S6). The posterior probability for the SDN model is \u223c95% in East Asia and \u223c80% in Europe, corresponding to Bayes factors (Bayesian measures of relative model support [32]) of \u223c10 and \u223c4, respectively. This provides substantial and robust evidence for the SDN model, compared to the SSV and NTR models for East Asian and European populations according to Jeffrey's interpretation [33]. Therefore, we conclude that the TT allele was likely positively selected upon appearance. The ABC-based parameter estimates are less reliable than the model choice [23] because they always have large credible intervals (Bayesian measures of confidence). However, the posterior distributions have modes that differ from the modes of the prior distributions, indicating that they are determined by information from the data and not by the prior (Fig. S5). Also, the estimates are quite concordant within and between continental groups (Fig. S5, Table 3). So while they should be interpreted with appropriate caution, the estimates do provide additional useful information about the model and timing of selection. We infer that the TT allele emerged before the out-of-Africa migration (estimated t\nmut\u224855,900 years ago (41,360\u201368,640)) and was immediately, or shortly thereafter, targeted by moderate positive selection (selection coefficient, s\nA, \u22480.58% (0.17\u20131.23)); we estimate that selection intensified substantially outside of Africa, with the selection strength nearly quadrupling in Europe and in Asia (s\nNA\u22482.6% (0.6\u20134.8); Table 3, Fig. S5).",

This model is reasonable because in TT/\u0394G heterozygotes only one IFNL4 copy is truncated, and because genetic studies show that the odds ratios (ORs) for HCV clearance in heterozygotes are intermediate to those in the two homozygotes [17]. These two arguments argue strongly against a model of complete dominance for TT as realistic, but other models are more difficult to discard a priory. We thus compare three dominance models: (1) a fully recessive model for the TT allele (h = 0), (2) the perfectly additive model used above (h = 0.5), and (3) a supra-additive model where the additive effect is non-linear and heterozygotes are closest in fitness to \u0394G homozygotes. This model has been proposed based on the ORs for the intronic IFNL4 variant, rs12979860 which is in high LD with rs368234815 and is thus a good proxy for the dominance effects of TT (Table 2) [34]. Based on those results we use a dominance coefficient h = 0.38 (see Note S4). When we compare the three dominance models in East Asia, regardless of the selection model, the fully recessive model has marginal support (4%), with the two additive models showing similar posterior probabilities (slightly higher for additive: 56%, than supra-additive: 44%, Fig. 5C and Note S4). When we compare the ABC results in the two additive models, they both strongly support the SDN model over the SSV model (95% in the additive model and 90% in the supra-additive model, corresponding to a Bayes factor of \u223c12), and both models provide virtually no support for the neutral model (Figure 5B\u2013D and Note S4). Parameter estimates also agree well among these two models (Fig. S5, Fig. S6 and Note S4). Therefore our results in East Asia validate the use of an additive model and show that the ABC inferences are not sensitive to the particularities of the additive model used. In European population the results are less clear, just as in the original ABC analysis and as expected given the weaker signatures of selection. Still, these results also support the two additive models (36% support for additive and 38% for supra-additive; Fig. 5C) as well as the SDN model (\u223c81% support for SDN in both the additive and the supra-additive, corresponding to a Bayes factor \u223c4, Fig. 5B and D, Note S4).",

The model is consistent with all our observations, including the marginal evidence for selection observed in non-Asian populations (Table 1). It is interesting that we infer selection on the TT allele even in Yoruba, where the signature is undetectable with classical methods likely because of weak selection and lower frequency although the TT allele shows clear signatures of homozygosity (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, and in agreement with this model, we do observe some signatures of positive selection in another African population, the Luhya. It remains possible that the advantage of the TT allele was counteracted by additional selective forces in Africa that maintained the TT allele at an intermediate frequency, such as balancing selection, although we note that the locus lacks classical signatures of long-standing balancing selection (Note S5, Table S7).",

However, due to its slow progression into fatal disease [35] HCV is unlikely to have exerted such strong selective pressure, although we cannot completely discard this possibility. Besides HCV, it has been shown that functional IFN-\u03bb4 has antiviral activity against coronaviruses [18], while the IFN-\u03bb4 pseudogene increases susceptibility to cytomegalovirus retinitis among HIV-infected patients [36]. Suggesting that IFN-\u03bb4 pseudogenization is likely associated with several phenotypic traits. It is perhaps surprising that suppression of an antiviral protein results in improved viral clearance, although it has for example been shown that during chronic infection blockage of persistent signaling of IFN I (a different type of interferon) can improve viral clearance [37], [38].",

Signatures of non-neutral evolution have been detected in other interferons, including at least one other IFNL family member (IFNL1 or IFNL2) [21]. Although the mode and tempo of selection in these other IFNL genes are not well understood, together these observations suggest that IFN-\u03bb proteins have played an important role in recent human adaptation, probably as a consequence of their role in individuals' constant fight with pathogens. It is likely, though, that only the selective history of the IFNL4-TT allele had a strong influence in the rate of clearance of some viruses, at least HCV, across human groups.",

A few exceptions exist, though, where truncating polymorphisms show signatures of positive or balancing selection [45]\u2013[50]. Still, as with other targets of selection, most of these cases lack biological interpretation. In fact, IFNL4 joins a small group of known genes where a striking signature of local adaptation is coupled with a clear molecular phenotype (e.g. [46], [47], [51]), which in this case is also associated with disease risk. As such, it contributes to our understanding of how recent human evolution has shaped genetic and phenotypic human diversity, including present-day heterogeneity in susceptibility to disease.",

We used two statistics to explore this expectation. First, iHS [27] measures the allele-specific decay of EHH within a population by comparing the associated EHH of ancestral and derived alleles. Second, XP-EHH [26] that detects alleles that are under selection in one population only, by comparing EHH patterns both among allelic types and across populations; as such XP-EHH has higher power to detect population-specific selection. Low frequency variants break the EHH signal, so following [59] we considered only SNPs with derived allele frequency \u03b5 5% for XP-EHH or minor allele frequency \u03b5 5% for iHS. Local recombination rate estimates were obtained from a combined recombination map based on HapMap data [60] from Africa, European, and Asian populations. Both statistics were standardized to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one; for iHS, scores were then binned by frequency (1%) as previously suggested [27].

In particular, we followed a published approach [23], which has been previously shown to discriminate well between SDN, SSV and neutrality (NTR) [23]. In brief, this approach is based on performing a large number of simulations under different selection models, with random parameters drawn from some probability distribution (called the prior distribution). Real data and simulations are compared based on summary statistics, and through a rejection scheme the simulations that most closely resemble real data help inform inferences about the best-fitting model. The parameter values that generate these simulations are then used to obtain the posterior distribution of each parameter, whose mean and standard deviation are used to perform the parameter inferences. We extended the method to consider more than one population, since two-population statistics are most informative in our case.",

We used 104 simulations to distinguish between the neutral model and the two selection models, and a larger set of 8\u00d7105 simulations for the more subtle distinction between the two selection models and for parameter estimation. For the simulations, we used the population history model estimated by Gravel et al. [63] and assumed a constant recombination rate of 1.76 cm/Mb throughout the region (average recombination rate in the IFNL locus [60]), and a perfectly additive model of dominance (h = 0.5). Lack of an appropriate demographic model for American and non-Yoruba African populations precludes analysis for those populations. The following single-population statistics were calculated: the average number of pairwise differences \u03c0, Watterson's \u03b8, Fay and Wu's H [28] and Tajima's D [67], all for both 4 kb around the site and a 8 kb (6 kb upstream and 2 kb downstream of the site) interval around the TT allele. The between-population statistics employed were: FST\n[68] for the selected site, FST in 4 kb around the site, FST for the whole region, and XP-EHH on the selected site [26]. In addition, we also included the frequency of the selected allele in both populations. This resulted in a set of 16 summary statistics, which, following Wegmann et al. [69] and Peter et al. [23], was reduced to seven summary statistics using PLS-DA [70] for model choice and regular PLS for parameter inference [71]. Performance of the ABC model choice and parameter distribution for the SDN model has been assessed for each particular model (Note S3). Confidence in the choice of selection models has been supported with Bayes factors.",
