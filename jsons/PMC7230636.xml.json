Since then, the virus has spread worldwide and has infected 167,515 patients globally, causing 6606 deaths as of 16 March 2020 [2,3]. Patients infected with the virus may either be asymptomatic or may experience mild to severe clinical symptoms such as pneumonia, respiratory failure and death [4]. The syndrome of clinical symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called \u201ccoronavirus disease\u201d (COVID-19) [5].",

Publications regarding SARS-CoV-2 were eligible for inclusion, regardless of study design and publication language. Therefore, case reports, case series, correspondences and editorials were processed in order to identify patient data. A confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 was defined and mostly diagnosed using the triple algorithm (epidemiological history, clinical symptoms and laboratory or radiological findings) as a standard procedure proposed by the World Health Organization. Studies involving animal experimentation were excluded. Reference lists of relevant studies were screened to identify any missing publications. All searches and title and abstract screenings, as well as study selection, were performed independently by two investigators. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Articles deemed potentially eligible were retrieved for full-text review. Non-English publications were translated by a native/fluent speaker. Ethics approval was not necessary.",

Patchy ground-glass shadow, which is more commonly peripheral/sub-pleural, with irregular shape and distribution of alveolar opacification and without geometric blurred vessels, were described. A single lung (single or multiple lobes) or both lungs (without a rigid pattern) may be affected. Ground-glass opacity nodules, which may progress to a larger opacity or irregular alveolar consolidation, were other common tomographic abnormalities reported.

However, for SARS-CoV-19, the chest tomography pattern of ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, often with a bilateral and peripheral lung distribution, is emerging as the CT hallmark of COVID-19 infection [24]. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been recently raised as a potential tool to enhance care, and there are several studies suggesting that AI can perform as well as or better than humans in imaging analysis for the diagnosis of different diseases [79]. A China-based technology company has developed an image-reading system that uses AI to detect abnormalities of possible coronavirus pneumonia. As AI can read a CT scan in seconds, it can help to assist physicians making fast judgments [80]. Furthermore, as PCR-based diagnosis requires long time periods until results are available, CT imaging with AI could serve as a surrogate for physicians when a quick decision is necessary [80]. The AI solution was launched on 19 February 2020 and by 28 February 2020 it had already been used on scans for 5000 patients [81]. However, due to the lack of evidence regarding the use of AI interventions, we recommend that more studies should be performed. Until then, the findings from these interventions must be used with caution to avoid incorrect decision-making.",

The use of supplementary oxygen therapy (38.9%), non-invasive (7.1%) and invasive ventilation (28.7%) and even ECMO (0.9%) was surprisingly high among the 1876 patients in which any kind of pharmacological and/or supportive intervention was reported, but no parameters of hypoxia, such as pO2 or SpO2, or even respiratory rate, were provided. Therefore, the real disease severity cannot be known in those cases and it cannot be known whether supplemental oxygen was used as a therapeutic or preventive measure. Recent studies have documented the remaining conflicting aspect regarding non-invasive ventilation in ill patients with SARS-CoV-19. For this reason, we suggest that physicians may not utilize non-invasive ventilation during clinical management, especially those with acute respiratory disease syndrome, due to the lack of evidence; if a patient\u2019s status does not get better or even get worse, mechanical ventilation can be favored [82,83]. So far, no specific treatment or vaccination for COVID-19 is available. More rigorously designed trials and investigations will be necessary to better understand the role of antiviral drugs.",

A number of theories have been created regarding this epidemiological observation and they deserve specific attention. Firstly, genomic mutation of the SARS-CoV-19 during its spread around the world may play a role in this process [84]. Secondly, different aspects in the quality of medical treatment in Wuhan medical facilities may account for this difference in mortality rates. Ji Y et al. [85] reported that a comprehensive analysis of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention data showed clear disparities in mortality rates between Wuhan (>3%) and other provinces of China (around 0.7%). The authors hypothesized that this is likely to be related to the quick rise in the number of infections in the epicenter.",

Nevertheless, given the lack of higher quality studies, inferences from such reports can be helpful in guiding decision-making [86]. Finally, there was considerable heterogeneity in the data, especially for the clinical symptoms, which we interpret not to be due not to major publication bias, but rather as a result of the small sample sizes in studies published so far (with a small number of patients experiencing less common symptoms), or because of the heterogeneity of the disease itself.",
