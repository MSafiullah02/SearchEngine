In these studies we also demonstrated the difficulty in synthesizing phosphoramidate prodrugs at the anomeric position of 2-deoxyribose as they were found unstable. To overcome this instability we have shown that introduction of fluorine atoms on the 2-position of 2-deoxyribose enabled the synthesis of phosphoramidate prodrugs of 2-fluoro and 2,2-difluoro-2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate7 (compounds 3a and 3b, respectively, Fig. 1). Within this context we have more recently reported on the synthesis of a series of phosphonamidate prodrugs of another stable analogue of 2-deoxy-d-ribose-1-phosphate, in which the anomeric oxygen has been replaced by a methylene group.8\n",

The term \u2018carbasugar\u2019 refers to a family of compounds in which the oxygen atom of the furanose sugar ring has been replaced by a methylene group.9, 10, 11 Carbasugars are chemically more stable towards degradation than their sugar analogues12 but at the same time, due to their resemblance to natural sugars, they may be still recognized by the same enzymes.12 It is well known that the therapeutic potential of drugs bearing a phosphate moiety is decreased because of the negative charges of the phosphate group at physiological pH.13 To overcome this problem, the ProTide technology has been successfully applied in the past to various nucleoside14 and sugar analogues.15 With this in mind we herein report the synthesis of a series of prodrugs of (3S,4R)-3-hydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl-1-phosphate 4 and (1R,2R,3S)-3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl-1-phosphate 5, as potential antiviral and anticancer agents (Fig. 1).",

Compound 8 was prepared in two steps from (1R,4S)-1-acetoxy-4-hydroxycyclopent-2-ene 6 according to a previously reported procedure.16, 17, 18, 19 In order to confirm the formation of compound 7, we further protected its hydroxyl groups as benzyl ethers obtaining the protected carbocycle 8. NMR analyses of 8 were in agreement with data reported in the literature.20 In addition, we prepared the Cbz-protected analogue 9, which we envisaged as a better intermediate for the synthesis of nucleoside aryloxyphosphoramidate prodrugs. The benzyloxycarbonyl group can be easily introduced into a nucleoside and most importantly, as reported in a recent paper by Schinazi et al.,21 it can be removed in neutral conditions, perhaps without affecting the phosphoramidate moiety. Hydroboration\u2013oxidation reaction of 8 was investigated using different borane reagents such as 9-BBN,16, 20, 22 dicyclohexylborane23, 24 or BH3\u00b7THF.23 The best yield was obtained with BH3\u00b7THF. As expected in addition to the carbocycle 10, formation of its regio-isomer 12 was also observed. Only the \u03b1-epimer of compound 12 was isolated whereas both alpha and beta epimers of compound 10 were observed in a 1:1 ratio. NMR spectra of compounds 10 and 12 were in agreement with the literature.20, 23 We then adapted these optimized hydroboration conditions to compound 9 obtaining carbocycle 11 (\u03b1-epimer) and its regio-isomer 13 (mixture of epimers in a 1:0.5 ratio) in 26% and 28% yield, respectively.",
