More specifically, turkey coronavirus (TCoV) causes a highly contagious enteric infection, which can lead to mortality and growth retardation (Guy, 2000; Cavanagh, 2005), while, in contrast, pheasant coronavirus infection (PhCoV) typically affects renal and respiratory tissues with consequent disease signs related to those body systems (Cavanagh, 2005). Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), recognized as the prototypic gammacoronavirus, primarily causes disease in chickens that is characterized by upper respiratory tract signs, including nasal discharge, \u2018snicking\u2019, \u2018r\u00e2les\u2019, watery eyes and lethargy (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2000; Cavanagh, 2007).",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus is of huge economic importance to the poultry industry worldwide, and the economic impact of disease is exacerbated in part by the existence of multiple serotypes of the virus, a property which complicates the detection and prevention of the disease (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2000). Multiple serotypes are known to circulate within a location (Worthington et al., 2008), while new variants frequently spread to different geographical regions. For example, the QX strain, which was initially identified in China, was first detected in Western Europe in late 2003, but was not identified in the UK until 2007 (Landman et al., 2005; Gough et al., 2008; Worthington et al., 2008). Different serotypes of the virus derive from variation in the S1 subunit of the spike (S) glycoprotein. The S1 subunit induces neutralizing antibodies in the host, and differences of only a few amino acids may exist between the S1 subunits of different IBV serotypes (Cavanagh, 2003, 2005).",

Consequently, birds may have to be vaccinated with multiple serotypes of the virus, including those contemporaneously circulating in the field (Cavanagh, 2003). This makes constant surveillance and testing necessary to identify cases of IBV and to determine the strains of IBV currently circulating within a location to ensure that the most suitable and cost\u2010effective strategy is implemented.",

More recently, nucleic acid detection methods such as RT\u2010PCR have been shown to be rapid, cost\u2010effective and suitable for use in a high\u2010throughput diagnostic environment. Real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR has been used as a diagnostic method for IBV (Jackwood et al., 2003; Callison et al., 2006; Escutenaire et al., 2007), and the use of a TaqMan\u00ae probe to follow the PCR provides an additional level of specificity. Nucleic acid amplification methods can also be used for IBV strain identification, as the amplicons generated by RT\u2010PCR can be sequenced to provide phylogenetic data (De Wit, 2000; Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2000).",

To allow determination of the strain of IBV present within a field sample, an S1 genotyping method was designed for routine use within a diagnostic laboratory setting. Samples of live attenuated IBV vaccines currently in use in the UK were sequenced using this method, and the sequence data generated used to populate the sequence library used during interpretation of the sequence data generated by the S1 genotyping test. Analysis of the sequences present in the sequence library demonstrated the sequences clustered in several main IBV serotypes including the so\u2010called Massachusetts, Italy 02, 4/91 (also known as 793/B and CR88), Arkansas and QX\u2010like serotypes (Fig. 1). The variation within sequences in these different groups has been shown to be <5%, equivalent to seven base changes in the 140 bp region used for sequence analysis.

Although clinical samples from pigeons with suspected disease were tested, these were not positive using the diagnostic real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Comparison of the sequence of the pigeon coronavirus 3\u2032 UTR to the sequence of the primers and probe used within this study shows several differences at the nucleotide level, suggesting that although amplification may occur, this could be inefficient and it may be preferable to use an alternative RT\u2010PCR to detect pigeon coronavirus.",

Because of the transcriptional strategy employed by coronaviruses in which sets of 3\u2032 coterminal nested RNA molecules are produced, the 3\u2032 UTR of the virus is present not only in the genomic RNA but also in the mRNA molecules produced by the virus.

Furthermore, a substantial number of field samples were positive using the molecular diagnostic assay, but no virus was isolated following attempted virus isolation in SPF embryonated fowls\u2019 eggs. Unlike virus isolation, real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR does not require the presence of viable virus particles. Therefore, the molecular method will be less affected than virus isolation by adverse storage and transport conditions that field submissions may be subjected to prior to receipt for testing which may result in degradation of the viral particles. This could account for the discrepancy between the results obtained with virus isolation and the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. The validity of the result obtained for 38 of the 173 real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR positive, virus isolation negative samples could be confirmed by sequencing of the amplicon generated by the diagnostic RT\u2010PCR. However, it was not possible to generate good\u2010quality sequence data from all of the 116 amplicons tested, and we hypothesized that this may be attributed to degradation of the viral RNA after the long periods of storage and repeated cycles of freeze\u2010thawing that the RNA extracts were subjected to. Alternatively, this may be caused by the short length of the amplicon used, as short stretches of sequence information could be difficult to identify using the BLASTN\u2010based method utilized within this study.",

S1 genotyping to identify an IBV strain is used widely (Kingham et al., 2000; Farsang et al., 2002; Bochkov et al., 2006; Worthington et al., 2008) and has been found to correlate with serotyping of the viral strain (Wang and Tsai, 1996; Keeler et al., 1998), although it has been demonstrated (Bochkov et al., 2007) that genotyping IBV strains using either the S or N genes can offer a different perspective on the relationship of IBV strains. Genotyping of the hypervariable region (HVR) of the S1 gene has also been reported to yield the same result as genotyping the entire S1 gene sequence (Wang and Huang, 2000). The S1 genotyping method described in this paper amplifies a region, including the HVR 2, which is known to show variation at the sequence level between different IBV strains (Cavanagh et al., 1988). The use of a panel of both forward and reverse primers should allow the identification of the majority of IBV strains currently circulating in Europe, as well as offering the opportunity to detect novel IBV genotypes as they arise, which is crucial for informing vaccination strategies. It is also recognized that performing such a genotyping assay in a routine testing environment offers an extra challenge in the form of data interpretation, particularly when distinguishing field from vaccine strains. It seems likely, as discussed (Worthington et al., 2008), that identification of strains with sequences identical to those of vaccine strains is likely to indicate the presence of the vaccine strain within the sampled birds. However, it cannot be discounted that theoretically, these could be separate field strains.",

Analysis based on the sequence of a 140\u2010bp region suggested that different groups of serotypes differed at the level of nucleotide identity at >15% in this region, consistent with published data that suggested that different serotypes varied at approximately 70% when comparing the first 560 nucleotides of the S1 gene (Cavanagh et al., 2005).",
