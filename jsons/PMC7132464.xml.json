Following this, all infants in the NICU were screened, revealing two more cases: these infants were initially asymptomatic (cases 6 and 10) but developed respiratory symptoms within 24\u201348 h. The 37 remaining premature infants in the NICU, all of whom were <34 weeks' gestational age at birth, were given palivizumab prophylaxis (administered i.m. at 15 mg/kg) within a few hours of detection of the index cases. The diagnosis of RSV was subsequently confirmed in all 13 cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Surveillance testing for RSV was repeated using Respi-Strip every 48 h until all of the infected infants became negative. Infants who tested negative with Respi-Strip were tested again if they became symptomatic on follow-up. Two days after palivizumab administration, RSV was detected in one additional infant (case 4) who had become symptomatic. Another infant (case 7), whose clinical picture was suggestive of RSV infection but who tested negative by Respi-Strip, was subsequently found to be positive by PCR. Besides RSV, patients were tested by PCR for influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, coronavirus 63/43, metapneumovirus and rhinovirus, and screened for bacterial sepsis by blood culture.",
