Their excellent antigen presentation potential can contribute to the activation of other cells of the immune system, and evidence is emerging that specialized subsets of these cells, that may be increased with age, can influence the cell-mediated immune system in antitumor responses. They can also regulate immune responses, to avoid autoreactivity and excessive inflammation. Deficiencies in regulatory B cells may be beneficial in cancer but will only exacerbate the inflammatory environment that is a hallmark of aging. The B cell role as antibody producers is particularly important, since antibodies perform numerous different functions in different environments. Although studying tissue responses in humans is not as easy as in mice, we do know that certain classes of antibodies are more suited to protecting the mucosal tissues (IgA) or responding to T-independent bacterial polysaccharide antigens (IgG 2 ) so we can make some inference with respect to tissue-specific immunity from a study of peripheral blood. We can also make inferences about changes in B cell development with age by looking at the repertoire of different B cell populations to see how age affects the selection events that would normally occur to avoid autoreactivity, or increase specificity, to antigen.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Tolerance \u00b7 B cell repertoire \u00b7 Autoantibodies \u00b7 Immunoglobulin genes \u00b7 Agerelated B cells \u00b7 Aging \u00b7 Antibody class switching \u00b7 Affinity maturation \u00b7 Regulatory B cells \u00b7 Humoral immunity ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Keywords"}, {"text": "It has been well established that the efficiency of the immune system declines with increasing age.

These antibody functions, and the rapidity of this primary response, have been shown to play a Fig. 1 B cell development. The humoral immune response is mediated by antibodies produced from plasma cells. These plasma cells are the end point in B cell development, which is characterized by (a) generation of a huge diversity of different B cells, each carrying a different antibody gene in the bone marrow and (b) selection processes using the affinity of the membrane-bound form of the antibody (the B cell receptor) for its antigen as the selection criteria. Diversity is generated by a process of gene rearrangement early on in the development of the cell, in the bone marrow prior to antigen encounter. T-dependent activation of B cells occurs via the germinal center. Innate B cell activation by T-independent antigens can also occur. Selection processes shape the repertoire. In the bone marrow, B cells are selected for survival, or not, on the basis of their antibody recognitionto eliminate inappropriate self-reactivity and encourage reactivity with foreign pathogens. In the germinal center, there is a mutation step, and the resultant B cells carrying improved antibodies are selected; this serves to increase the affinity of the antibody for the relevant antigen. Both generation of diversity and selection of antibody are complex processes that are crucial for an effective humoral immune system. A clear understanding of these processes, and how they are affected with age, is needed in order to comprehend the etiology of age-related inflammatory and infectious disease vital role in protection from extracellular bacterial pathogens (Brown et al. 2002) . T-independent responses, in general, are particularly important in protection against bacterial pathogens, where the external antigens of the pathogen are nonprotein in nature. Antibodies afford protection against viral infection by neutralizing virus particles, binding and blocking key molecules involved in cellular infection. Similarly, they can also neutralize toxins. Later T-dependent affinity maturation of B cells in an immune response is slower but results in the generation of more highly specific antibodies, often of a different class. The elderly are susceptible to infections by a wide variety of pathogens, all of which involve B cells and antibodies in the normal course of the immune response (Table 1) . The lungs are, in common with other mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, particularly vulnerable to infection by virtue of their exposure to the environment. As is illustrated in Table 1 , pulmonary infections are common in older people. The elderly are usually the first to be affected by annual epidemics of respiratory infections and frequently suffer the worst clinically. Mortality figures attributable to influenza and pneumonia are confused by the fact that influenza is very often followed by a secondary infectionmost notably by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Brinkhof et al. 2006; van der Sluijs et al. 2004; Seki et al. 2004 ). Resolution of a first infection can leave a person susceptible to a secondary bacterial infection, and this may be of particular concern in older people (Dunn-Walters and Ademokun 2010; Ademokun et al. 2011 ).

In the oldest old (85 years and over), there was a 32-fold increased chance of mortality from influenza or influenza-associated pneumonia compared with those aged 65-69 years (Thompson et al. 2003) . A prospective study, following 608 healthy elderly, showed that approximately twice as many people had RSV infection than did influenza A infection, and in a period of 2 years, 13% of these patients contracted either influenza or RSV (Falsey et al. 2005) . The predicted probability for Older patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to enter hospital within 28 days of Contracting CAP is 86% (Millett et al. 2015) . There is also an increased incidence of pneumococcal septicemia in old people associated with S. pneumoniae infection (McIntosh et al. 2005; Weil-Olivier et al. 2012) . It is known that specific antibodies generated during a T-dependent B cell response are crucial for protection against influenza. Ineffective influenza-specific antibody, as assessed by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, is associated with lowered protection from the disease (Goodeve et al. 1983 ). It has been said that an age-related decrease in influenza protection can be solely accounted for by the reduced T cell help available in the diminished elderly T cell repertoire.

Immunity against S. pneumoniae is particularly reliant on a healthy B cell population, since the antigenic portion of S. pneumoniae is a capsular polysaccharide and a T-independent type II (TI-II) antigen. Unlike a T-dependent B cell response, where the maturation of the B cell antibody relies on T cell help and therefore any failure to respond could be attributed to a failure of T cells, this response is independent of direct T cell help.

It has been consistently shown that the effectiveness of vaccines is severely diminished in older people. Since specific antibody production is often used as a correlate of protection, vaccine studies are a useful way of observing the humoral immune response. An agerelated reduction in specific antibody production occurs in response to many vaccines, including hepatitis B (Fourati et al. 2016) , pneumonia (Simberkoff et al. 1986; Koivula et al. 1997; \u00d6rtqvist et al. 1998 Rubins and Janoff 2001) , tetanus, diphtheria and tick-borne encephalitis (Hainz et al. 2005; Weinberger et al. 2013) . The most commonly studied vaccine is that against influenza. The cellular response, i.e., T cells and release of cytokines, macrophages, and natural killer cells, is decreased with age, and the IgG antibody titer is significantly lower (Goronzy and Weyand 2013; McElhaney et al. 2016) . While vaccination of older people against influenza is widely accepted as a valid health strategy to reduce disease incidence (Odelin et al. 2003; Keitel et al. 2006; Maciosek et al. 2006) , disease mortality may not be affected (Simonsen et al. 2005; Rizzo et al. 2006 ). In agreement with previous studies, we have shown that older people fail to develop protective Haemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers following vaccination (Ademokun et al. 2011; Reber et al. 2015) . Recent studies have investigated different vaccination regimes in an effort to improve protection in the elderly. There is some evidence that boosting within 12 months of vaccination improves antibody responses and reduces innate responses (Kannan et al. 2015) . Successive vaccination can improve the older immune response to levels shown by younger adults (H\u00f6pping et al. 2016 ). In the case of influenza, the response that is being studied is that of a recall response and may be complicated by the existence of slightly cross-reactive antibodies formed against previous strains of influenza. A study of vaccine responses against diseases that are not endemic in the country of origin can circumvent this. Some travel vaccines, such as hepatitis A, also show a reduced specific antibody response (Genton et al. 2006) , while others such as yellow fever seem to show an undiminished antibody response but the response takes longer (Roukens et al. 2011) , and there is an increased risk of adverse events in older people (Monath et al. 2005; Roukens et al. 2011; Thomas et al. 2012 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 592, "end": 613, "text": "(Fourati et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 626, "end": 650, "text": "(Simberkoff et al. 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 651, "end": 671, "text": "Koivula et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 672, "end": 692, "text": "\u00d6rtqvist et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 693, "end": 716, "text": "Rubins and Janoff 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 767, "end": 786, "text": "(Hainz et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 787, "end": 810, "text": "Weinberger et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1074, "text": "(Goronzy and Weyand 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1097, "text": "McElhaney et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1226, "end": 1246, "text": "(Odelin et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1266, "text": "Keitel et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1288, "text": "Maciosek et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1351, "text": "(Simonsen et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1369, "text": "Rizzo et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1550, "text": "(Ademokun et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1569, "text": "Reber et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1832, "text": "(Kannan et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1930, "end": 1950, "text": "(H\u00f6pping et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2371, "end": 2391, "text": "(Genton et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2526, "text": "(Roukens et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 2594, "end": 2614, "text": "(Monath et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 2615, "end": 2635, "text": "Roukens et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 2636, "end": 2654, "text": "Thomas et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Loss of Vaccine Efficacy in Old Age"}, {"text": "Aging is associated with an increased level of inflammatory markers such that this phenomenon which is sometimes referred to as \"inflammaging.\" The most consistent data associates age and increased TNF\u03b1 and IL6 cytokine levels in the serum; CRP is often also measured.

In the overall environment, with contributions from many other cells, it is not clear whether B cells make a significant contribution to the overall inflammatory milieu, although evidence is gradually emerging to show that their cytokine profile and responses are changed so they do contribute at some level. Older memory B cells have been shown to secrete higher levels of TNF\u03b1.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an age-related inflammatory autoimmune disorder, and the increase in rheumatoid factor (RF) with age tempts one to assume a causal link. However, the increase in RF occurs regardless of whether the subject has RA or not (Andersen-Ranberg et al. 2004) , and the presence of another autoantibody, anticyclic citrullinated peptide is associated with a higher risk of RA. This antibody is likely a result of environmental factorsspecifically with smoking (Michou et al. 2008) . The successful use of therapies such as rituximab, which utilize an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody to ablate peripheral B cells, is ample evidence that B cells play an important part in the disease process of RA, but their role as antigenpresenting cells, activating T cells, and producers of cytokines may be more prominent than as autoantibody producers (Bugatti et al. 2014) . A further complication in understanding the role of B cells in RA is their role as regulators, as outlined below. Another age-related autoimmune disease is ANCA-associated vasculitis, with a peak incidence at age 65-74 in the UK (Watts et al. 2000) . The disease is characterized by antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), of which the two most common targets are myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). In this instance, the role of the autoantibodies seems to be clear, in that they inappropriately activate neutrophils leading to systemic inflammation affecting joints, lungs, kidneys, and other tissues.

Indeed, the fact that mouse studies are mostly from splenic B cells and humans are mostly PBMCs may confound attempts at extrapolation from mouse to human studies. In many instances, the starting point for distinction between human subsets is the expression of surface markers CD19 (pan B cell), IgD, and CD27. IgD is present on all mature B cells that have not been activated by exogenous antigen and also on a population of \"IgM memory cells.\" CD27 is an activation marker on B cells and is present on most, but not all, memory cells. In this instance, B cell memory is generally confirmed by class switching and/or the presence of mutations in the Ig gene. Markers CD24 and CD38 are also often used to distinguish functional populations of cells.

It has been suggested that they are exhausted B cells, which have been a long time in activation and can no longer continue the response. However, the level of mutation in the Ig genes of these cells is generally lower than in the CD27+ cells , so it is difficult to argue that they have been activated for longer time. It has also been suggested that this population of cells contains tissue-like memory B cells that are activated by T-independent mechanisms as they are present in CD40-deficient individuals and therefore cannot receive T cell help to mature (Zelm et al. 2014) . We can see evidence of related clones between the CD27-and CD27+ populations, but the lineage analysis does not show that one is consistently derived from the other . Coupled with our data that shows some CDR3 character differences between the populations , we are inclined to think of this population of cells as containing a \"sin bin\" for potentially autoreactive B cells that do not receive enough accessory cell help to allow them to continue the activation and maturation process. This does not exclude the possibility that T cell-independent responders, and potentially other types of cells, are included here. If this is the case, then an increase in this population with age implies a decrease in T cell help which allows potentially autoreactive antibodies to progress and/or loss of early stage tolerance mechanisms allowing more autoreactive B cells into the peripheral milieu.

If, it is the IL10 rather than the contact-dependent mechanism of suppression that is changed with age (Duggal et al. 2013) , then the capacity of other B cells to produce IL10 is also important. A decrease in IgM memory cells with age, as mentioned above, will likely also result in reduced IL10 production capacity. Indeed the studies of van der (Geest et al. 2016) indicate that IL10 production from all B cells decreases with age, while the ability to produce the inflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1 is unaffected.

Memory cells are often described as \"class switched\" with no further distinction. IgG is by far the most common antibody in circulation and therefore the most prevalent in the literature. However, in recent years, evidence is emerging to indicate that different classes and subclasses of antibody have critical roles in the immune response. IgA antibodies are thought of as mucosal antibodies, and the huge area of exposure to exogenous antigens at mucosal surfaces certainly requires specialized and efficient protection. The physiology of the gut undergoes significant changes with age, and much more work is required to understand the complex relationship between gut physiology, microbiota, and the mucosal immune system in aging (Mabbott et al. 2015) . The character of the germinal center in Peyer's patches changes with age, with indications of less specific antibody selection (Banerjee et al. 2002) . The serum IgA response to pneumococcal vaccine in older people is diminished with age, as is that of the serum IgM response (Ademokun et al. 2011) . While these responses form a small part of the overall serum immunoglobulin response to the vaccine, it is thought that they are key to the antipneumococcal function of serum antibodies (Park and Nahm 2011) . Furthermore, in high-throughput sequencing studies, some patients exhibited poor resolution of the immune response after vaccine challenge in terms of reduction of immunoglobulin clonality at day 28, and this failure was ascribed to IgA 1 only (Wu et al. 2012 ). In the same vaccine study, which compared adults aged 19-45 with those aged 70-89, there was a consistent increased level of IgG 2 relative to IgG 1 subclass in the older group. In human, IgG 2 is the class of antibody produced by T-independent antibodies such as pneumococcal polysaccharides and is limited in its effector abilities as a result of its poor affinity for Fcgamma receptors (Bruhns et al. 2009 ). Younger adults show a significant qualitative difference in the use of IGHV family genes in the IgG 1 and IgG 2 repertoire, possibly reflecting different activation and/or tolerance mechanisms in repertoire selection. In contrast, the repertoire of IgG 1 in older people is changed such that it more resembles that seen in IgG 2 , indicating a possible change in activation/tolerance mechanisms with age (Martin et al. 2015) .The textbook view of antibody function is that the specificity and affinity for antigen are dependent on Fab, and only the function of the molecule is changed by class switching to a different Fc. However, it has been shown that changing the class of an antibody can affect its fine specificity so class switch is important for more than just changing effector function (Torres et al. 2005) .

The FDCs are the stromal cells of the GC and play a key role in regulating the humoral immune response (Tew et al. 1997; Gatto and Brink 2010) . Unlike antigen-presenting cells (APCs), FDCs present intact antigen-antibody complexes on their cell surface (Zhang et al. 2016a) , in the form of immune complexes which are highly immunogenic, and assist GC B cell proliferation (Qin et al. 2000; Li et al. 2000; Bannard et al. 2013) . During centroblast proliferation, in the dark zone of the GC, hypermutation of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes encoding antibody occurs. The B cells move into the light zone, as centrocytes, and will die by apoptosis unless they receive rescue signals conditional on efficient recognition of the antigen by the newly formed B cell receptor. Rescue signals are provided by FDCs and T follicular helper (T FH ) cells (Sage and Sharpe 2016) . Since FDC and T cell help are limiting, there is competition between B cells, and therefore selection of those B cells with the highest affinity for antigen occurs. The resulting B cells can switch the class of their antibody, from IgM to IgG/IgA/IgE, which also requires T cell help. B cells with high-affinity antibody differentiate into either memory B cells, to provide for an efficient recall response, or plasma cells to secrete antibody.

If the starting population of B cells has already been modified in response to a different antigen, then its ability to effectively change to accommodate a new antigen may be compromised. It is now well established, in mice, that na\u00efve B cell output into the periphery decreases with age. It is known that B cell precursors in humans are also reduced with aging (Kuranda et al. 2011) , which is likely to lead to reduced B cell output from the human bone marrow, and the fact that children reconstitute B cell function after bone marrow transplants more rapidly than adults do would support this (Savage et al. 2001 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 70, "end": 92, "text": "(Banerjee et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 758, "end": 779, "text": "(Kuranda et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 992, "end": 1011, "text": "(Savage et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Older B Cell Receptor Repertoire"}, {"text": "Since B cell memory appears to be maintained by proliferation (Macallan et al. 2005) , it is possible that proliferating memory B cell clones make up for any shortfall in immunological space caused by lower na\u00efve B cell input. This leads us to postulate that GC reactions in older individuals may use \"second hand\" B cells more often, which would have consequences for B cell diversity. A diverse and functional repertoire of antibodies is essential to produce an effective humoral immune response. If the repertoire of B and plasma cells is reduced, then the ability to recognize foreign antigen is severely compromised. B cell diversity and antibody specificity are defined during the early stages of B lymphocyte differentiation, where the Ig genes are formed. The remarkable way in which gene segment rearrangement forms a complete Ig gene from different segments results in millions of different B cells, each with a unique Ig sequence capable of producing antibody with distinctive specificity (Fig. 3) . Briefly, the Ig molecule consists of both heavy and light chains. There are three types of gene segments: variable (V), diversity (D, heavy chain only), and joining (J). The segments are randomly recombined to generate a VDJ for the heavy chain or VJ for the light chain. Thus a germline repertoire of 176 different V, D, or J genes can result in a possible 8,408 different gene rearrangements. Combination of the heavy and light chains results in over 3.7 million combinations. The region where the junctions join together is further diversified by an incomplete joining process. Addition and deletion of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity at these joints lead to junctional diversity.

This would give a quantitative estimation of repertoire disruption based on divergence away from a Gaussian distribution of CDRH3 lengths. In this way, we could show that dysregulated repertoires were more common in older people and were associated with frailty (Gibson et al. 2009 ). Spectratypes also indicated that a failure in the resolution of the immune response might occur in older people and that there were significant changes in CDRH3 length overall (Ademokun et al. 2011) . However, although a spectratype is a relatively inexpensive way to investigate large cohorts of individuals, there is no qualitative information on the repertoire as a whole. Even high-throughput repertoire sequencing has its limitations when it comes to sampling the whole repertoire (Boyd et al. 2013 ), but a number of studies have confirmed the presence of age-related changes such as clonal expansions (Wu et al. 2012; Jiang et al. 2013) , change in CDRH3 character Wang et al. 2013; Martin et al. 2015) , and change in class switching and subclass distribution (Rubelt et al. 2012; Galson et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2015) .

Light chain rearrangements can be either kappa or lambda and do not have D regions. During the rearrangement process, random N-nucleotides (N) are inserted into the junctions to form a unique CDR3 sequence. In this way, a huge number of different Ig genes are created, with correspondingly large antigen-binding possibilities. Selection processes will act on the repertoire to exclude potentially autoreactive sequences and favor sequences encoding useful antibodies.

As outlined above, these events are all affected by age and will affect the memory B cell repertoire. One key difference in the repertoire after an immune response is in the size and physicochemical character of the CDRH3 region, a region which is crucial for antigen binding . This occurs regardless of the activating antigen. At first sight, it might seem that a small CDRH3 size is beneficial to exogenous antigen binding. However there is also a decrease in CDRH3 size as B cells mature in the bone marrow so a more likely explanation is that larger CDRH3 sizes are deleterious in some way, presumably with autoreactive potential, and so are removed from the repertoire.

Validation studies showed defects in glucose catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and increased reactive oxygen species in B cells with age (Kannan et al. 2016) . Since obesity and metabolic syndrome are increased with age, the BMI of study subjects may be a confounding factor in age-related B cell studies.

It may indeed be true that a decreasing na\u00efve B cell output in the face of homeostatic mechanisms to keep the total number of B cells the same has resulted in the repertoire being increasingly made up of antigenexperienced expansions of cells. There may actually be an underlying infection, but the normal febrile symptoms by which we recognize as infection do not show due to the effects of immune senescence or a failure to resolve a response from a prior infection in a timely manner. A high-throughput repertoire study of individuals of known seropositivity status for the chronic viral infections CMV and EBV has shown that EBV, but not CMV, can cause an increase in clonal expansions in the repertoire (Wang et al. 2014) . Alternatively there may be pathological monoclonal expansions of B cells, such as are seen in leukemia or lymphoma. Usually, these are diagnosed conditions, and individuals with this sort of medical history are excluded from studies on B cell diversity. However, it might be possible that a preclinical condition exists in some people. An increase in monoclonal expansions of B cells, both of CD5+ and CD5-phenotype, has previously been reported in older people (Ghia et al. 2004 ). Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a predominant plasma cell disorder (Kyle et al. 2006 ) and has been shown to increase with age in both humans (Kyle et al. 2006 ) and mouse (Radl 1990 ). It is characterized by an increase in the presence of serum monoclonal Ig. MGUS is not found in young subjects, is prevalent in around 2% of over 50s, and has been reported to vary in the elderly from 11% to 38% (Kyle et al. 2002) . There is an association between MGUS and onset of multiple myeloma or related malignant condition with average risk assessed at about 1% per year (Kyle and Vincent Rajkumar 2003) . A vaccination study of MGUS patients showed poor vaccine responses and indicated that the recruitment of B cells to the immune response was compromised by the prior existence of expanded clones (Tete et al. 2015) . Hence while one danger of MGUS is in potential transformation to malignancy later in life, another key risk is in susceptibility to infection. One might assume that in older people without MGUS, but with inappropriate expansions of B cells (as mentioned above), this would also be the case. Other malignancies of B cells other than myeloma are age-associated; a prime example is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is thought to arise from a premalignant monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) that also carries a risk of susceptibility to infection (Whitaker et al. 2014; Scarf\u00f2 and Ghia 2016) . The B cell receptors encoded by CLL are autoreactive (Herve et al. 2005) , and hence we think that the expansion of potentially autoreactive B cells in older age is a likely contributor to malignant transformative events.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 831, "end": 849, "text": "(Wang et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1331, "text": "(Ghia et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1448, "text": "(Kyle et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1523, "text": "(Kyle et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1546, "text": "(Radl 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1780, "text": "(Kyle et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1929, "end": 1961, "text": "(Kyle and Vincent Rajkumar 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2158, "end": 2176, "text": "(Tete et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 2734, "end": 2756, "text": "(Whitaker et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 2757, "end": 2778, "text": "Scarf\u00f2 and Ghia 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 2834, "end": 2853, "text": "(Herve et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Monoclonal Expansions and Lymphomas"}, {"text": "The presence of B cells in several tumor types (colorectal, breast, lung, and gastric cancers) has been strongly associated with improved prognosis in a number of studies (Nelson 2010; Hennequin et al. 2015) . This may be as a result of their role as antigenpresenting cells, thus aiding the tumor-infiltrating T cells, or may be a function dependent on their antibody (Nelson 2010; Lee-Chang et al. 2014) . It is interesting to note that the age-associated 4-1BBL+ B cells make excellent antigen-presenting cells that can activate CD8+ T cells and therefore stimulate antitumor activity (Lee-Chang et al. 2016 ). B cell infiltrates may be diffused or aggregated into tertiary lymphoid structures, in some cases recapitulating germinal center morphology. Clonal expansions of switched B cells have been shown in melanoma, where the presence of B cells is also thought to be beneficial (Saul et al. 2016 ). However, experiments in mice have indicated that tumor-infiltrating B cells can be regulatory, causing downregulation of the antitumor response, and the presence of B regs in a number of solid tumors (e.g., pancreatic, ovarian, esophageal, hepatocellular carcinoma) has been predicted to aid tumor growth by inhibition of T cell activity and promotion of inflammatory growth effects (Schwartz et al. 2016) . B regs in human PBMCs are of the IgM class, so perhaps distinguishing tumor B cells by class of antibody might aid in discriminating between the different functional effects. It has been suggested that aged human monocytes can convert B cells with regulatory capacity into antitumor 4-1BBL+ B cells (Lee-Chang et al. 2016) .

In addition, there is much scope for investigating B cell responses outside the textbook T-dependent IgG 1 antibody production. Many key age-related changes are in T-independent responses which would involve IgM, IgG 2 , and IgAparticularly at mucosal surfaces mucosal surfaces which are often the first to encounter external pathogens and which and which may be involved in educating the host humoral immune system with respect to distinguishing inappropriate activation signals.
