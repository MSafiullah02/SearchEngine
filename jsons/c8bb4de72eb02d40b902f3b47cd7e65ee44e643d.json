It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately screen patients with COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this study, a total of 1658 patients with COVID-19 and 1027 patients of CAP underwent thin-section CT. All images were preprocessed to obtain the segmentations of both infections and lung fields, which were used to extract location-specific features. An infection Size Aware Random Forest method (iSARF) was proposed, in which subjects were automated categorized into groups with different ranges of infected lesion sizes, followed by random forests in each group for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method yielded sensitivity of 0.907, specificity of 0.833, and accuracy of 0.879 under five-fold cross-validation. Large performance margins against comparison methods were achieved especially for the cases with infection size in the medium range, from 0.01% to 10%. The further inclusion of Radiomics features show slightly improvement. It is anticipated that our proposed framework could assist clinical decision making.",

            "text": "Currently, a patient, showing respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, or pneumonia, would be referred to the test of real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for the final diagnosis of COVID-19 [7] . However, recent studies show that RT-PCR has relatively low detection rate at around 30-60% [8, 9] , and repeated tests are generally needed. Therefore, negative results of RT-PCR could not rule out the possibility of infection. Chest CT is a routine diagnostic tool for pneumonia, and is found very useful in detecting typical radiographic features of COVID-19, especially with thin slices [8, 10] . Basically, these features include bilateral and peripheral ground-glass and also consolidative pulmonary opacities. According to the time course of disease development, patients could be divided into mild, moderate, severe and critically ill stages [11] . In the mild stage, almost no pneumonia could be seen from CT images. From common to critically ill stages, one could observe ground-glass opacity (GGO), increased crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation [8] . If the symptom of patient improves, gradual resolution of consolidation could be seen in CT images. However, it remains a great challenge in screening of COVID-19 from typical vital pneumonia in CT images. First, same radiographic features presenting similar appearances to other types of pneumonia, makes it difficult to differentiate from each other. Second, CT images, especially for thin slice acquisition, contain hundreds of slices for manual checking, which is time-consuming and may produce false negative results especially at the mild disease stage. Accordingly, an automated image analysis method for classifying COVID-19 from CAP is highly desired.",

            "text": "Although there are a number of researches summarizing typical CT radiographic signs in COVID-19 patients for guiding clinical practice, the study on automated machine learning assisted disease screening is still limited. For example, Wang et al. proposed a deep learning method to classify the patches of infected lesions into COVID-19 or typical viral pneumonia of totally 99 subjects, where manually labeled infections were required [12] . Xu et al. studied the early screening of COVID-19 from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases with totally 618 CT samples [13] , where lesion patches were extracted and combined with relative distance-from-edge features for diagnosis. Li et al. proposed to a 2D model to extract features  from 2D slices and combined to provide diagnosis of 468  COVID-19, 1511 CAP, and 1303 non-pneumonia patients. Another difficulty in differentiating COVID-19 patients from CAP patients is the vast difference of distribution of disease stages in the available data. For COVID-19, the stages from mild condition to critically ill almost evenly distributed in the population of COVID-19 patients. However, for CAP, most cases remain in mild to intermediate degree of pneumonia as observed in CT images. The main reason could be that there are already effective treatments available for CAP while not for COVID-19 yet. This leads to inconsistent distribution of disease severity in the acquired dataset where small infections found in CT images are most likely belonging to CAP, while wide spread infections found in CT images are for COVID-19. A general classification algorithm may take advantage of this situation and report an overall high performance result, but may have low sensitivity and specificity in the middle range where the infection size is not too small or too large, which helps little for doctors in clinical practice. This is mainly because the effect of the size of infection has not been evaluated and properly considered in the classification algorithm.",

Given proper annotations as training data, the V-Net is capable of segmenting infected lesions as well as lung fields. This software has been evaluated in segmentation of infections and lung fields and achieved Dice similarity coefficient of 92% between automated and manual infection segmentations.

In these models, size would be chosen as a major feature as it could easily separate both groups, although this leads to a low performance for the classification of middle-size groups and does not reflect the real radiographic appearance differences between two types of pneumonia. In this work, we proposed a new classification strategy with its flow chart shown in Fig.  3 . In particular, all data were randomly partitioned to 5 equally-sized subsamples. In each fold, 4 subsamples were used for training data to construct the classification model, and the rest one subsample was used as testing data. This process was repeated until all subsamples were tested. Fig.  3B shows the schematic diagram where, in each fold, all images were preprocessed, and machine learning models were trained including feature extraction, selection, and disease classification. In the testing stage, a new image would undergo the preprocessing steps, and then the model predicted its probability of being COVID-19 or CAP.",

These features are composed of 4 categories, including the volume, infected lesion number, histogram distribution, and surface area. The detailed feature distribution framework is shown in Fig. 4 . Volume features. We extracted the total volume of infected region, and calculated the percentage of the infected region of the whole lung. By using the lung field masks, we further extract the volume and percentage, respectively, in each lobe and pulmonary segment. As there is evidence that COVID-19 more likely occur in both lungs, we calculate the infected lesion difference as well as the percentage difference between left and right lungs. Infected lesion number. Another image difference between COVID-19 and CAP is that most of COVID-19 infections encompassed bilateral lungs with multifocal involvement [8, 16] , and COVID-19 generally also has concentrated infected lesions while CAP shows small in volume and patchy in distribution [17] . Therefore, we calculate the characteristics of the total number of infected regions in the bilateral lungs, lung lobes, and pulmonary segments, respectively. Histogram distribution. The manifestations of COVID-19 had its own characteristics, which are different from other types of pneumonia, such as Influenza-A viral pneumonia [13] . The predominant chest CT findings show that bilateral and peripheral GGO and consolidation were a radiologic hallmark of COVID-19 [6, 18, 19] . GGO is a pattern of hazy increased lung opacity with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, whereas consolidation is characterized by a homogeneous increase in lung parenchymal attenuation that obscures the margins of vessels and airway walls on CT image [17] . In order to extract CT intensity distribution of the infected region, we calculated the histogram features of the infected region. According to the window width of the lung window of 1500 and the window level of -600, the intensity value range of the lung region image obtained by inference tends to be between -1350 and 150. According to the preset intensity value interval, we divided the interval into 30 equal bins, and counted the frequency of intensity level in the infected region at each bin to obtain the frequency distribution histogram features. Surface area. Compared with CAP, it has been found that COVID-19 had a predominate distribution in the posterior and peripheral lung [20] , and the abnormalities of lung parenchyma eventually spread to the central area and bilateral upper lobes [8] . Therefore, we constructed the infection surface as well as the lung boundary surface. We further calculated the distance of each infection surface vertex to the nearest lung boundary surface, and categorized them into 5 ranges, as 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 voxels (voxel spacing is 1.5mm). For features, the number of infection surface vertices within each range of distances to the lung wall were calculated. Furthermore, the percentage of infection vertex number against the number of whole infection surface vertices in each range were also obtained.",

In accordance with the previous reports [8, 19, 22] , the observation regarding the high prevalence of bilateral and peripheral lung opacities, multiple lobular and subsegmental areas infections, and multifocal involvement is the most typical findings on CT images of COVID-19 patients. For example, COVID-19 pneumonia tends to manifest on CT images as bilateral and a slight predominance in the right lower lobes with the mean involved lung segment number of 10.5 [3] . Besides, multifocal involvement was more common than unifocal involvement in COVID-19 patients [8] . In the present study, we proposed a size-aware and location-specific machine learning framework. The proposed method first separated the cohorts into different size groups through the decision tree, thus reducing the bias of infection size. From 5-fold experiments, the obtained decision trees show that, when separating the dataset into 4 groups, consistent thresholds around 0.01%, 0.3%, and 7% could be obtained (supplementary material Fig. S1 ). The feature weight analysis further shows that few size related features were chosen by the proposed method. Therefore, our findings emphasize the importance of percentage of infected lesion in the prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia. Meanwhile, we also compared the current handcrafted features in this study with Radiomics features extracted directly from Fig. 7 .

Results show that, using Radiomics features alone, the proposed method has lower performance (2.4% in accuracy) than that of handcrafted features.
