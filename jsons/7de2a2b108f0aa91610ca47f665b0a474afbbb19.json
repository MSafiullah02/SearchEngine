The usefulness of this experimental ON model was evaluated using both conventional and advanced bio-imaging techniques, including contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI and a high-resolution micro-CT. Details on establishment of methodology are described, which were adopted into an efficacy study on a herbal Epimedium-derived phytoestrogenic extract (HEPE) developed for prevention of steroid-associated ON using an established rabbit model. The underlying mechanisms of HEPE for prevention of steroid-associated ON were found to be associated with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular bone marrow lipid deposition, the two known mechanistic pathways in pathogenesis of ON. Our experimental results provide for potential clinical trials or applications of HEPE in the prevention of ON among highrisk patients undergoing steroid treatment.",

Apart from potential dose variations in steroid use, frequency of herb preparation used for SARS patients during pulsed steroid treatment was much higher in southern China (Hong Kong and Guang Zhou) than in North China (Beijing); thus, we speculate that the much lower ON incidence in Hong Kong and Guang Zhou might be attributed to potential preventive effects of herbs involved in conventional anti-inflammatory traditional herbal medicine including phytoestrogenic extraction from herbal Epimedium during life-saving standard pulsed steroid for treatment of SARS patients (Lau and Leung \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d; Liu et al. \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63e) , whereas no such conventional approach was introduced for treatment of SARS patients in Beijing (Li et al. \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d) .",

These observations motivated the investigators of this chapter to establish the following hypothesis that HEPE might prevent steroid-associated ON through a unique mechanism associated with inhibition of both thrombosis and lipid deposition. In order to confirm this hypothesis, animal experiments are essential to investigate whether HEPE is able to prevent steroid-associated ON development experimentally, as no clinical trials with controlled conditions are ethically possible to confirm the above-mentioned epidemiologic observations.",

            "text": "There are two protocols commonly used for establishing steroid-associated ON model in rabbits. One protocol is to use a single injection of high-dose methylprednisolone (MPS; i.e., H-MPS 1); however, this has a low incidence of ON (43%; Yamamoto et al. \uf6dc\uf641\uf641\uf63f) . The other protocol is to use two injections of high-dose lippolysaccharide (LPS) combined with subsequent three injections of high dose MPS (i.e., H-LPS 2\u2212H-MPS 3), but this carries a high mortality (50%; Yamamoto et al. \uf6dc\uf641\uf641\uf63d) . For developing intervention strategies for steroid-associated ON, there is a need to develop protocols for establishing animal model with a high incidence but low mortality. Recently, a steroid-independent ON rabbit model was successfully established with a single injection of low-dose LPS, which showed a higher incidence of ON lesion (77%) and lower mortality (11%) as compared with the protocol (i.e., H-LPS 2\u2212 H-MPS 3) due to avoidance of severe LPS-induced shock by lowering the given dose (Irisa et al. \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf6dc) . The authors of this chapter recently confirmed that a single lowdose LPS injection combined with three subsequent injections of pulsed high-dose MPS did induce a high incidence of ON but low or even no mortality in rabbits (Qin et al. \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63e) . The first part of the chapter reviews the development of imaging methods for studying alterations of blood circulation under the influence of steroid treatment.",

This experimental ON model was adopted for efficacy study on an herbal Epimedium-derived phytoestrogenic extract (HEPE) developed for prevention of steroid-associated ON. The underlying mechanisms of HEPE for prevention of steroid-associated ON were found to be inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular bone marrow lipid deposition, evaluated using both conventional and advanced bio-imaging techniques, including contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI and a high-resolution micro-CT. Our experimental results support further clinical study and the potential application of HEPE in the prevention of ON development in high-risk patients undergoing steroid treatment.",
