            "text": "As several countries around the world are planning exit strategies to progressively lift the rigid social restrictions implemented with lockdown, different options are being chosen regarding the closure or reopening of schools. We evaluate the expected impact of reopening schools in \u00cele-de-France region after the withdrawal of lockdown currently scheduled for May 11, 2020. We explore several scenarios of partial, progressive, or full school reopening, coupled with moderate social distancing interventions and large-scale tracing, testing, and isolation. Accounting for current uncertainty on the role of children in COVID-19 epidemic, we test different hypotheses on children's transmissibility distinguishing between younger children (pre-school and primary school age) and adolescents (middle and high school age). Reopening schools after lifting lockdown will likely lead to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the following 2 months, even with lower transmissibility of children, yet protocols exist that would allow maintaining the epidemic under control without saturating the healthcare system. With pre-schools and primary schools in session starting May 11, ICU occupation would reach at most 72% [55,83]% (95% probability ranges) of a 1,500-bed capacity (here foreseen as the routine capacity restored in the region post-first wave) if no other school level reopens before summer or if middle and high schools reopen one month later through a progressive protocol (increasing attendance week by week). Full attendance of adolescents at school starting in June would overwhelm the ICU system (138% [118,159]% occupation). Reopening all schools on May 11 would likely lead to a second wave similar to the one recently experienced, except if maximum attendance is limited to 50% for both younger children and adolescents. Based on the estimated situation on May 11, no substantial difference in the epidemic risk is predicted between progressive and prompt reopening of pre-schools and primary schools, thus allowing full attendance of younger children mostly in need of resuming learning and development. Reopening would require however large-scale trace and testing to promptly isolate cases, in addition to moderate social distancing interventions. Full attendance in middle and high schools is instead not recommended. Findings are consistent across different assumptions on the relative transmissibility of younger children and for small increase of the reproductive number possibly due to decreasing compliance to lockdown.",

They aim to strike a delicate balance between reviving the economy and relieving social pressure while averting a potentially devastating second wave of infections. Plans for lifting lockdown are quite heterogeneous in Europe 1 , and a large debate sparked regarding the closure or reopening of schools. Italy and Spain have chosen to adopt restrictive and conservative solutions, keeping schools closed until September to preserve children's health 2, 3 . Denmark and Norway already reopened their primary schools 4, 5 . Austria plans to allow students to go back to school on May 18 with alternating classes, i.e. splitting students in two groups, each attending lessons during half of the week. Greece will restart classes with high schools first, on May 11, followed possibly by pre-schools and primary schools on June 1, if epidemic conditions remain favorable.",

A retrospective analysis of the Oise cluster in northern France showed evidence for large asymptomatic viral circulation in a high school, whereas case investigation and contact tracing had identified only two symptomatic cases (testing was not performed in absence of symptoms) 18 . Also, the closure of school for winter holidays in mid-February led to a substantial drop in the number of symptomatic cases, confirming the central role of the high school in the observed cluster.",

Accounting for current uncertainties, here we focus on the role of contacts at schools and the impact that different protocols for school reopening may have on the control of the epidemic in the upcoming months. In a previous work 21 we proposed different exit strategies to relax the stringent constraints of lockdown on social life and economy while curtailing the burden on the health-care system. All explored measures however assumed that schools remained closed at all time. Here we simulate scenarios of partial, progressive or full reopening of schools, with differential opening of pre-school and primary schools vs. middle and high schools, following the plan illustrated by the French Government 6 . School reopening according to different protocols is compared with the scenario where all schools remain closed after lockdown ends. School reopening or closure is coupled with moderate social distancing interventions 21 and large-scale case tracing, testing, and isolation.

Four age classes are considered: [0-11), [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , , and 65+ years old. The first class includes ages of students in pre-school and primary school, and the second class corresponds to students in middle and high school. We use social contact matrices measured in France in 2012 23 to account for the mixing, in the no interventions scenario, between individuals in these age groups, depending on the type of activity and place where the contacts occur (household, school, workplace, transport, leisure, other). Transmission dynamics follows a compartmental scheme specific for COVID-19 (Figure 1) , where individuals are divided into susceptible, exposed, infectious, hospitalized, in ICU, recovered, and deceased. The infectious phase is divided into two steps: a prodromic phase ( ! ) and a phase where individuals may remain either asymptomatic ( \" ) or develop symptoms. In the latter case, we distinguished between different degrees of severity of symptoms, ranging from paucisymptomatic ( !# ), to infectious individuals with mild ( $# ) or severe ( ## ) symptoms. Asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals have a reduced transmissibility % = 0.55, as estimated in Ref. 24 . Here we show results for a probability of being asymptomatic \" =20% 25 ; a sensitivity analysis on this value was performed in a previous work 21 . Time spent in each compartment is assumed to follow an exponential distribution, except duration in ICU which is modelled through a gamma distribution, as it best captured the data.

For example, the lockdown matrix is constructed assuming 70% of workers not going to work (because of telework, closure of activity, caring for children not going to school, and other cases), school closure, 90% reduction of contacts established by seniors, and closure of non-essential activities. In Ref. 21 we explored progressive exits from lockdown, with social distancing interventions of different degrees of intensity (strict, moderate, mild) coupled or not with case finding, testing and isolation. Following announcements by authorities, here we consider Exit 1 21 , a combination of moderate interventions with efficient tracing, testing and isolation of cases ( Table 1 ). Moderate interventions consider that 50% of adults do not go to work, 50% of non-essential activities remain closed, contacts of seniors are reduced by 75%, and contacts on transport are reduced according to presence of workers and reopening of activities. These social distancing interventions are combined with isolation of 50% of cases through a 90% reduction of their contacts, simulating the result of rapid and efficient tracing and testing of cases 21 . A sensitivity on the rate of case isolation is also performed.",

Partial reopening means that at most 50% of students return to school, envisioning for example a rotation of students every half of the week or every week, or considering 50% attending in the morning and 50% in the afternoon.

It required not only additional material (beds, respirators, rooms, etc.) but also personnel who was transferred from other medical specialties to support the increase in response. Exiting the current emergency, we envision that ICU capacity will be restored to lower levels for the upcoming months, as the system has been stretched to limits that are not sustainable in the long term. We foresee a capacity of 1,500 beds, considering a 25% increase compared to pre-COVID-19 epidemic size to re-establish almost routine conditions while accounting for the need to continue facing a pandemic situation for the next several months.

As more epidemiological evidence accrues, this effect can be taken into account and help further alleviate control measures. We modeled epidemic trajectories through summer to estimate the delayed impact that 8 weeks of schools in session in May and June may have on the hospital system in the month of July. However, we cannot accurately parameterize the model during summer, because of lack of contact data (we used Spring holiday contact data as a proxy instead) and of information about control measures and protocols for holidays that will be enforced during summer months (we considered moderate social distancing measures still in effect, with no holidays). Also, we did not consider seasonal behavior in viral transmission 41, 42 , as this is still under investigation. Due to these large uncertainties, the trajectory of the number of cases during summer cannot be considered accurate and should be interpreted with caution.
