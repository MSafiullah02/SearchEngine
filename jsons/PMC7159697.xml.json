            "text": "\n1The seasonality of respiratory viral infections among transplant recipients usually follows that of the general population (2, 3).2The viruses all cause a range of disease, from mild congestion and rhinorrhea to more severe tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. No one virus is exclusively associated with one clinical syndrome (i.e. influenza\u2010like illness, croup, etc.). As such, diagnostic strategies should initially be broad, attempting to screen for all recognized viruses (3, 4) with particular emphasis on ones that might be amenable to therapy. Symptoms commonly associated with a respiratory viral infection include fevers, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, watery eyes, cough, sore throat, sputum production, wheezing, shortness of breath and fevers.3Transplant recipients often present with mild or atypical symptoms. Lung transplant recipients, for example, may initially only have subjective symptoms of shortness of breath or subtle changes in pulmonary function testing without more typical symptoms (5). Fever may be absent in transplant recipients with pneumonia or may be the sole presenting sign or symptom (1, 4). As such, any fever or respiratory symptom should prompt the consideration of a respiratory viral infection as the potential cause.4Viral shedding is usually prolonged among transplant recipients. Prolonged shedding is seen even with the use of antivirals and therefore may contribute to the increased risk of resistant variant emergence (1, 6).5Transplant recipients are at higher risk of infectious complications compared to immunocompetent hosts. In the older studies, initial evidence of or progression to lower tract involvement with viruses occurred frequently, but may in part be due to ascertainment biases as sicker patients were more likely to be seen by physicians and have specimens sent for viral assays (1). Respiratory viral infections are a significant risk factor for subsequent development of fungal and bacterial pneumonia (1). Other infections, such as CMV viremia, may complicate respiratory viral infections as well.6Respiratory viral infections appear to be a risk factor for both acute and chronic rejection with the greatest risk in lung transplant recipients (5, 7, 8, 9) (II\u20102). Concurrent rejection and graft dysfunction has been documented with other solid organ transplant recipients as well, although at a lower frequency than in lung transplant recipients (1) (III). The pathogenesis of the link between respiratory viral infections and rejection is not clearly understood.7All pediatric solid organ and lung transplant recipients appear to have the greatest risk of both RNA viral infections and more severe courses and complications (1).8All are potential nosocomial pathogens which can be potentially spread by staff or visitor with mild upper respiratory illness.9There are few prospective studies of respiratory virus infections in most solid organ transplant populations, with the exception of lung transplant recipients. Most of these studies were retrospective in nature and focused on individuals who were hospitalized with infections (1). In addition, most studies evaluated patients close to the time of transplantation when specimens were more likely to be obtained for diagnosis. This likely leads to an overestimation of the severity and underestimation of the incidence of these infections among transplant recipients.\n",

Diagnosis can be achieved by combinations of serology, virus culture, antigen detection and nucleic acid testing. Serology is generally not clinically useful. In general, all patients with presumed respiratory viral infection should have a nasopharyngeal swab, wash or aspirate performed and sent for rapid antigen testing, if available. Although positive results for the test may be considered diagnostic, negative results do not rule out infection. Rapid antigen testing may only detect a limited number of viruses (i.e. only influenza and/or RSV) and therefore additional testing may be warranted. Negative rapid tests does not rule out infection and should trigger additional testing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct florescent antibody (DFA) or culture, dependent on which is available locally. If upper tract samples fail to document the cause of the respiratory illness or if there is clinical or radiologic evidence of lower tract involvement, bronchoalveolar lavage should be considered and sent for the range of available tests.

Risk of disease and complications appear to be greatest in pediatric and lung transplant patients with variable levels of severity in other transplant populations (1, 3, 10, 17, 18).

The injectable vaccine has been studied in all transplant patients and has been found to be safe and not associated with an increased risk of rejection or adverse outcomes (21). There is potential for replication of the live attenuated vaccine, so its use is contraindicated in highly immune suppressed patients and their close contacts (22). Although responses vary based vaccine year, specific influenza strains, immunosuppressant and recipient type, and while responses in transplant recipients are less robust than those of healthy controls, most recipients do have some benefit. Accordingly, annual trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for transplant recipients, their close contacts and caretakers >6 months of age (I) (22). Antiviral chemoprophylaxis can be considered as an alternative or supplement to vaccination (I) (22). Agents active against circulating influenza strains should be used. A randomized, double\u2010blind study of oseltamivir prophylaxis in high\u2010risk transplant recipients found a protective efficacy of 75%; of note, 40% also received vaccination (23).",

Treatment with these agents in transplant recipients has been studied in case reports and is associated with reduced risk of lower respiratory tract complications (e.g. bronchiolitis, pneumonia), duration of symptoms, mortality and possibly a reduced risk of progression to bronchiolitis obliterans after infection (17) (III). Prospective studies have not been conducted, although a dose ranging study of oseltamivir is underway.

First, patients have prolonged viral replication, even with therapy, such that the approved 5 day duration of therapy may be insufficient to treat transplant recipients (24). Likewise, immunocompromised transplant recipients may benefit from therapy even if they have had symptoms beyond 48 h before presentation. Higher doses of medications or combinations of antivirals may have benefit in transplant recipients (1). Some experts recommend treating all transplant recipients with proven influenza, irrespective of symptom onset, and continue therapy until viral replication has been documented to have ceased; culture or PCR\u2010based methods should be used to monitor patients for shedding (1) (III).",

In general, nearly all influenza A/H3 viruses are resistant to M2 inhibitors and this resistance affects both amantadine and rimantadine equally (25). Many influenza A/H1 viruses have developed resistance to oseltamivir, although currently they retain susceptibility to zanamivir and most are also susceptible to M2 inhibitors (22, 26). There are limited data about the use of zanamivir in lung transplant recipients; as with all patients with underlying lung disease, if zanamivir is used, rescue inhalers should be readily available and the first dose should be given in a monitored setting. Recommendations as to the optimal management of influenza are updated based on real\u2010time surveillance of circulating strains and their susceptibility. As such, current dosing recommendations from health authorities should be consulted regularly.",

Risk factors for more severe disease after organ transplantation include infection in children under a year of age or with underlying lung disease (1, 9). Early acquisition of RSV after transplantation or after augmented immunosuppression has been associated with increased severity of disease in some but not all studies (1, 8, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32).

However, no studies have been conducted to evaluate their use in the transplant setting and the cost of the weight adjusted dosing of these products in adults would be extremely high. Despite this, some experts would support the use of immunoprophylaxis for children less than 1 year of age who receive their transplant during the RSV season (III); survey data suggest that antibody\u2010based prophylaxis is commonly used among pediatric transplant centers (35).

The role of specific antiviral treatment is controversial. Ribavirin has been shown to have in vitro activity against RSV and the aerosolized form of this drug has been approved for the treatment of lower respiratory tract disease due to RSV in certain at\u2010risk populations (36). Despite its FDA approval, convincing data describing the clinical efficacy of this agent are lacking and a consensus on the utility of this drug in the treatment of RSV disease does not currently exist. Published data on the treatment of RSV disease in solid organ transplant recipients are very limited. Experience in stem cell transplant populations suggest that the use of aerosolized ribavirin may reduce mortality associated with severe RSV infections, particularly those affecting the lower airways (30, 36, 37). The combination of aerosolized ribavirin and antibody\u2010based interventions, including IgIV, RSV\u2010Ig and palivizumab appear to have an even greater impact on mortality (1, 38). Many experts, therefore, would recommend the use of the combination of aerosolized ribavirin and an antibody preparation for the treatment of severe RSV infections (II\u20102) (1, 28). Based upon published experience from pediatric organ transplant recipients, patients without risk factors for severe disease and with only upper respiratory infections are unlikely to benefit from aerosolized ribavirin (II\u20102) (28). There are published reports of successful treatment of RSV in lung transplant recipients with oral and IV ribavirin with and without corticosteroids (39, 40). Further studies are needed to determine the clinical efficacy of these alternatives because there is a risk of adverse effects, notably hemolytic anemia.",
