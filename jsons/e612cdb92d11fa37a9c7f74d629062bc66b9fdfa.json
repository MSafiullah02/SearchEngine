The EIS program was established at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by Alexander Langmuir in 1951 to provide formalized epidemiologic support to health departments and training for the future public health workforce [2, 3] . Approximately 80 EIS officers (EISOs) are chosen from > 500 applicants each year and assigned to specific positions at CDC headquarters, state or local health departments, or other organizations (i.e., field-based EISOs) [4] . Field-based EISOs directly support the host jurisdiction with investigations of local health problems and in addition, supplement efforts to strengthen the organization's public health infrastructure. During their fellowship, EISOs participate in applied, competency-based training through both classroom (~5%) and on-thejob (~95%) experience and are required to complete a set of specific core activities, which include the following: participation in a public health-related field investigation; preparation and submission of a conference abstract, brief scientific report (e.g., for CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [MMWR]), and manuscript; and presentation to a scientific audience, among others [2, 4] .",

This assistance is provided in response to formal requests from state, local, federal, and international organizations, and foreign ministries of health (Epi-Aids) [3] . The goal of Epi-Aids is to identify prevention and control measures in response to an urgent outbreak or other public health problem. Epi-Aids are always performed collaboratively with partners, both domestically and internationally, to provide frontline response for investigating disease outbreaks, natural and man-made disasters, and other public health emergencies through use of epidemiologic methods [1, 3] . The Epi-Aid team typically consists of at least one EISO not assigned to the inviting jurisdiction, other CDC staff or trainees as needed (e.g., students that participate in the CDC's Epidemiology Elective), and is supervised by a subject matter expert from CDC headquarters [5] .

In certain circumstances, Epi-Aids support investigations of health problems affecting more than one state or jurisdiction (multistate Epi-Aid) or affecting the entire country (nationwide Epi-Aid). Epi-Aid responses are documented by the request for an Epi-Aid (i.e., Epi-1), followed by a report of the investigation [3] . The Epi-1 is a form that contains information regarding the subject and nature of the problem, location, persons and organizations involved, and mission objectives. The Epi-Aid report is a written summary produced after each Epi-Aid investigation and provides scientific feedback to the state or locality where the epidemic or health problem occurred; these reports become CDC records. Although the primary objective of Epi-Aids is identification of prevention and control measures to stop the outbreak or public health problem, Epi-Aid reports and the associated knowledge gained often establish the basis for subsequent scientific literature submitted to peer-reviewed journals and MMWR.",

The search included MMWRs and peer-reviewed publications with an EISO as a coauthor. When necessary, a Google Scholar\u00ae (Google, Incorporated, Mountain View, California) or Scopus\u00ae (Elsevier V.B., Amsterdam, Netherlands) search was conducted to identify the number of citations. To assess the dissemination timeliness of these publications, we calculated the number of days from the Epi-Aid initiation date to publication date; if the exact publication date was unavailable, the 15 th day of the specified month was used. MMWRs and manuscripts on the basis of Epi-Aids conducted during the study period and published before June 2015 were included in our study; if both the electronic publication and print dates were available, the earlier date was chosen. number of times a journal's articles are cited, providing a measure of the journal's credibility within the science community. Journal IFs were available only for publications indexed in the JCR for > 2 years. Data were analyzed during June 2015 by using Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This project was reviewed by CDC for human subjects protection and was deemed to be nonresearch. Among the total 807 Epi-Aid investigations, 632 (78.3%) were infectious disease-related ( Table 1 ). The distribution of health topics was similar during each study year, except for 2009 when the percentage of infectious disease-related investigations (85.6%) was higher than other years (Table 1 ). In 2009, CDC responded to 28 (27%) Epi-Aids in response to the 2009 influenza A (pH1N1) pandemic, including six multistate and nationwide investigations conducted by 72 EISOs. During 2012, CDC responded to a higher proportion of chronic disease-related investigations (7.6%) compared with other years (Table 1) . These investigation topics included newborn screening for critical congenital health disease in the states of New Jersey and Georgia [6, 7] and investigation of factors associated with disparities in cancer incidence. A higher number of environmental-related investigations (n = 11) were conducted in 2005 compared with other years. The year 2005 is designated the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history and presented seven major hurricanes [8] . CDC responded to six related Epi-Aid requests, including three Epi-Aids in response to Hurricane Katrina supporting emergency preparedness, mortality surveillance [9] , carbon monoxide poisoning, and environmental damages. The highest number of injuryrelated investigations (n = 10) during our study period were conducted during 2008 and addressed topics including peripheral inflammatory neuropathy cases associated with swine slaughter activities [10, 11] , vascular access hemorrhage among hemodialysis patients [12] , and injection safety and control assessment of ambulatory surgical centers [13] .",

In 2008, seven Epi-Aids were requested and 14 EISOs participated in response to a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul infections associated with consumption of raw produce, which infected > 1,440 persons in the United States [14] [15] [16] . In 2007, an increased number of multistate and nationwide Epi-Aids were conducted (n=10), including a multistate outbreak of Acanthamoeba keratitis associated with use of a contact lens solution [17] , a multijurisdictional investigation of traveler with extensively drugresistant tuberculosis, and a multistate outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection associated with consumption of prepackaged spinach. In 2012, four Epi-Aid investigations were conducted by 12 EISOs in response to a fungal meningitis outbreak among patients who received contaminated steroid injections [18] [19] [20] [21] . During 2006, a multistate outbreak of mumps affecting 11 states resulted in three Epi-Aids and deployment of six EISOs [22] [23] [24] ; also in 2006, two other Epi-Aids were conducted to assist during multistate outbreaks of Salmonella infections (i.e., Salmonella Newport, Salmonella Braenderup, and Salmonella Typhimurium) associated with consumption of raw tomatoes eaten in restaurants in the United States [25] . These Samonella outbreaks involved 21 states and resulted in the identification of 459 culture-confirmed cases of salmonellosis.",

During 2010, CDC assisted in 97 Epi-Aids, including 25 (25.8%) international investigations, which is approximately twice as many international investigations compared with previous years (Table 1) . During the aftermath of the influence A (pH1N1) pandemic, CDC received six Epi-Aid requests from ministries of health to assist in strengthening influenza surveillance systems in Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Argentina, and South Africa (Johannesburg and Pietermaritzburg). In addition, during January 2010, Haiti experienced a devastating earthquake followed by the world's largest cholera outbreak [26] . Haiti requested an Epi-Aid for which six EISOs were deployed to investigate the outbreak, support implementation of cholera prevention and control strategies, and evaluate surveillance and response efforts [27] . The highest percentage of international investigations (27.4%) during our study period was conducted in 2014. Three Epi-Aids were requested after the first local transmission of emerging chikungunya virus in the Americas was identified on Caribbean islands during late 2013 [28, 29] . In 2014, the largest Ebola epidemic in history was reported and affected multiple West African countries; > 27,000 cases and > 11,000 deaths were reported from Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia [30] . In the United States, two imported cases that included one death, and two locally acquired cases among healthcare workers were reported. In response to the Ebola outbreaks, eight Epi-Aids were conducted by 46 EISOs and their colleagues in four countries in West Africa and two U.S. states [31] [32] [33] [34] . EISOs collaborated with public health authorities in the inviting jurisdictions to publish findings from Epi-Aid investigations in a total of 80 peer-reviewed medical, public health, and state medical journals. The majority of manuscripts (55%) were published in a journal with an IF of 1-5; a total of 31 (11%) manuscripts were published in journals with IFs from 1 to < 2; and 49 (18%) manuscripts were published in journals with IFs from \u2265 2 to 3. Nineteen (7%) manuscripts were published in a journal with an IF of > 20.

For example, as of November 2015, approximately 2,000 CDC staff and EISOs participated in > 2,500 field deployments to assist with Ebola response efforts that included surveillance, contact tracing, data management, laboratory testing, and health education across the United States and Africa (CDC administrative data). In addition, hundreds of CDC staff were stationed at the EOC to provide logistics, staffing, communication, analytics, management, and other Ebola response support functions.",

After completing an Epi-Aid investigation, EISOs submit a report to the pertinent public health authority that clearly presents findings and recommendations to guide decisions, policies, and public health action. As part of their training, EISOs are encouraged to collaborate with field partners to publish Epi-Aid investigation results. During our study period, EISOs published > 400 scientific information products on the basis of Epi-Aids, and approximately half of the Epi-Aids resulted in \u2265 1 publication. Although the primary objective of Epi-Aids is to prevent and control public health problems, the resultant publications share new knowledge, lessons learned, and recommendations with the scientific community, furthering progress of public health science, practice, and policy.",

First, because of the high level of scrutiny and extensive peer-review process required before publication, the analyses focused on MMWRs and manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals. Our study did not include abstracts, which although cleared by CDC, are not peer-reviewed and are difficult to compare across different conferences. Second, our study might underestimate the number of publications, particularly for Epi-Aids conducted during 2014. Given that it can take months after journal acceptance for MMWRs and manuscripts to be published, certain Epi-Aids might not have been captured in the analyses or might have been missed if not clearly associated with an Epi-Aid or EISO coauthor. Third, we lacked information regarding the date of Epi-Aid completion, which would be a more accurate way to measure the time necessary for an EISO and collaborators to publish their work on the basis of Epi-Aids. Finally, our study included publications on the basis of Epi-Aids with EISOs as coauthors, which might underestimate the total number of publications available on the basis of Epi-Aids.",

Although Epi-Aids are only a part of work performed by EISOs, they represent a substantial contribution of epidemiologic assistance to the United States and international community. Collectively, Epi-Aids provide knowledge transfer and also offer EISOs an avenue for broader experience and training in epidemiologic methods, communications, and leadership. Because new public health problems emerge and the practice of applied epidemiology expands to new areas [1] , EISO participation and contribution in epidemiologic field investigations are valuable in helping protect the public's health.

Approximately 81 Epi-Aids were conducted each year (median, 80; range, 62-104) with the highest annual number of Epi-Aids being requested during 2009 and the lowest during 2007 (Table 1). On average, two EISOs were deployed for each Epi-Aid, for a total of 1,522 EISO deployments. The average number of EISOs on the Epi-Aid team increased from one (median, 1; range, 1-4) in 2005 to four (median, 3; range, 1-22) during 2014. Six Epi-Aids involved \u2265 10 EISOs each, which corresponded to substantial public health responses, including the Ebola outbreak response in West Africa during 2014; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the United States during 2014; evaluation of pertussis vaccine effectiveness in Vermont during 2014; and influenza A (pH1N1) outbreak in the United States during 2009.",

Among 807 Epi-Aids, 394 (48.8%) investigations resulted in publications; 347 (43%) Epi-Aids resulted in one publication, 42 (5.2%) resulted in two publications, four (0.5%) resulted in three publications, and a 2006 investigation of respirator use in water-damaged buildings in Louisiana resulted in four (0.1%) publications (data not displayed). On the basis of Epi-Aids each year, EISOs published an average of 13 MMWRs (median, 13; range, 5-25) and 28 (median, 30; range, 2-46) scientific manuscripts. The majority of publications were infectious disease-related (81%), with a higher percentage of infectious disease-related manuscripts (83.2%) than MMWRs (76.3%). The median time from Epi-Aid initiation date to publication was 196 days (mean time, 262 days; range, 11-1,398 days) for MMWRs and 828 days (mean time, 926 days; range, 82-2,858 days) for manuscripts. A total of 110 (39%) manuscripts were published within two years of Epi-Aid initiation, and 110 (84%) MMWRs were published within one year of Epi-Aid initiation.",
