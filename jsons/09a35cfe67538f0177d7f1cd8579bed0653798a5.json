The recent work of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of movie recommendations has shown that this popularity bias leads to unfair treatment of both long-tail items as well as users with little interest in popular items. In this paper, we reproduce the analyses of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of music recommendation. Specifically, we investigate three user groups from the Last.fm music platform that are categorized based on how much their listening preferences deviate from the most popular music among all Last.fm users in the dataset: (i) low-mainstream users, (ii) medium-mainstream users, and (iii) high-mainstream users. In line with Abdollahpouri et al., we find that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms favor popular items also in the music domain. However, their proposed Group Average Popularity metric yields different results for Last.fm than for the movie domain, presumably due to the larger number of available items (i.e., music artists) in the Last.fm dataset we use. Finally, we compare the accuracy results of the recommendation algorithms for the three user groups and find that the low-mainstreaminess group significantly receives the worst recommendations.",

Since this dataset contains 1.1 billion listening events of more than 120,000 Last.fm users and thus is much larger than the MovieLens dataset used in [2] , we focus on a subset of it. Precisely, we extract 3,000 users that reflect the three user groups investigated in [2] . To this end, we use the mainstreaminess score, which is available for the users in the LFM-1b dataset and which is defined as the overlap between a user's listening history and the aggregated listening history of all Last.fm users in the dataset [3] . It thus represents a proxy for a user's inclination to popular music. Our subset consists of the 1,000 users with lowest mainstreaminess scores (i.e., the LowMS group), the 1,000 users with a mainstreaminess score around the median (i.e., the MedMS group), and the 1,000 users with the highest mainstreaminess scores (i.e., the HighMS group). In total, we investigate 1,755,361 user-artist interactions between 3,000 users and 352,805 music artists. Compared to the MovieLens dataset with only 3,900 movies that Abdollahpouri et al. [2] have used in their study, our itemset is, consequently, much larger. Fig. 1 depicts the listening distribution of music artists in our Last.fm dataset. As expected, in Fig. 1a , we observe a long-tail distribution of the listener counts of our items (i.e., artists). That is, only a few artists are listened to by many users, while most artists (i.e., the long-tail) are only listened to by a few users. Furthermore, in Fig. 1b , we plot the ratio of popular artists in the profiles of our 3,000 Last.fm users. As in [2] , we define an artist as popular if the artist falls within the top 20% of artists with the highest number of listeners. We see that around 1,000 of our 3,000 users (i.e., around 1/3) have at least 20% of unpopular artists in their user profiles. This number also corresponds to the number of low-mainstream users we have in the LowMS user group.",

Next, in Fig. 2 , we investigate if there is a correlation between the user profile size (i.e., number of distinct items/artists) and the popularity of artists in the user profile. Therefore, in Fig. 2a , we plot the number of popular artists in the user profile over the profile size As expected, we find a positive correlation (R = .965) since the likelihood of having popular artists in the profile increases with the number of items in the profile. However, when plotting the average popularity of artists in the user profile over the profile size in Fig. 2b , we find a negative correlation (R = \u2212.372), which means that users with a smaller profile size tend to listen to more popular artists. As in [2] , we define the popularity of an artist as the ratio of users who have listened to this artist. Concerning RQ1, we find that one-third of our Last.fm users have at least 20% of unpopular artists in their profiles and thus, are also interested in lowmainstream music. Furthermore, we find that users with a small profile size tend to have more popular artists in their profiles than users with a more extensive profile size.

We define the preference of a for u by scaling the listening count of a by u to a range of [0, 1000] as also done in [15] . We then recommend the top-10 artists with the highest predicted preferences.",

Specifically, we evaluate three baselines, i.e., Random, MostPopular, and UserItemAvg, which predicts the average listening count in the dataset by also accounting for deviations of u and a (e.g., if u tends to have in general more listening events than the average Last.fm user) [6] . We also evaluate the two KNN-based approaches [13] UserKNN and UserKNNAvg, which is a hybrid combination of UserKNN and UserItemAvg. Finally, we include NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) into our study [9] . To reduce the computational effort of our study, in our evaluation, we exclude ItemKNN [12] as well as SVD++ [11] in contrast to [2] . In Fig. 3 , we plot the correlation of artist popularity and how often the six algorithms recommend these artists. For all algorithms except for Random, we find a positive correlation, which means that popular items are recommended more often than unpopular items. As expected, this effect is most evident for the MostPopular algorithm and not present at all for the Random algorithm. It also seems that this popularity bias is not as strong in the case of NMF, which we will investigate further in the next section of this paper.",

            "text": "To investigate the popularity bias of music recommendations for different user groups (i.e., LowMS, MedMS, and HighMS), we use the Group Average Popularity (GAP ) metric proposed in [2] . Here, GAP (g) p measures the average popularity of the artists in the user profiles p of a specific user group g. We also define GAP (g) r , which measures the average popularity of the artists recommended by a recommendation algorithm r to the users of group g. For each algorithm and user group, we are interested in the change in GAP (i.e., \u0394GAP ), which shows how the popularity of the recommended artists differs from the expected popularity of the artists in the user profiles. Hence, \u0394GAP = 0 would indicate fair recommendations in terms of item popularity, where fair means that the average artist popularity of the recommendations a user receives matches the average artist popularity in the user's profile. It is given by: \u0394GAP = GAP (g)r\u2212GAP (g)p GAP (g)p . In Fig. 4 , we plot the \u0394GAP for our six algorithms and three user groups. In contrast to the results presented in [2] , where the LowMS group (i.e., the niche users) receives the highest values, we do not observe a clear difference between the groups except for MostPopular. We think that this is the case because of the large number of items we have in our Last.fm dataset (i.e., 352,805 artists compared to 3,900 movies in MovieLens). However, in line with Fig. 3 , we again find that Random and NMF provide the fairest recommendations.",

Interestingly, the MedMS group gets the best recommendations, probably since the users in this group have the largest profiles (i.e., on average 715 artists per user as compared to around 500 for the other two groups). Across the algorithms, NMF provides the best results. This is especially of interest since NMF also provided the fairest results in terms of artist popularity across the personalized algorithms.",
