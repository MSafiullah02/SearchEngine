Whereas cellular immunity controls acute infection, humoral immunity regulates central nervous system (CNS) persistence. Maintenance of serum Ab was correlated with tissue distribution of virus-specific Ab-secreting cells (ASC). Although virus-specific ASC declined in cervical lymph node and spleen after infectious virus clearance, virus-specific serum Ab was sustained at steady levels, with a delay in neutralizing Ab. Virus-specific ASC within the CNS peaked rapidly 1 wk after control of infectious virus and were retained throughout chronic infection, consistent with intrathecal Ab synthesis. Surprisingly, frequencies of ASC in the BM remained low and only increased gradually. Nevertheless, virus-specific ASC induced by peripheral infection localized to both spleen and BM. The data suggest that CNS infection provides strong stimuli to recruit ASC into the inflamed tissue through sustained up-regulation of the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10. Irrespective of Ag deprivation, CNS retention of ASC coincided with elevated BAFF expression and ongoing differentiation of class II + to class II -CD138 + CD19 + plasmablasts.

The absence of dedicated lymphatic drainage and the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB) limits Ag transport from the CNS into secondary lymphoid tissue as well as trafficking of both cells and macromolecules into the CNS. In addition, CNS resident cells do not express MHC molecules [7] [8] [9] ; therefore, in the absence of inflammation, there is little possibility for endogenous Ag presentation, consistent with the inability to initiate immune responses within the CNS [10]. Nevertheless, Ag deposition into the CNS, under conditions in which the BBB integrity remains relatively intact, results in a robust local humoral immune response [11] . In situ ASC differentiation at the site of Ag deposition is preceded by peripheral activation, as implied by the early detection of Ag-specific ASC in cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and spleen and the necessity of CLN for intrathecal Ab production [11] . These data suggest that an Ag depot within the CNS is recognized as non-self and that functions associated with peripheral B cell differentiation are sustained within the CNS. A variety of CNS inflammatory diseases support trafficking and preferential retention of ASC within the CNS. During virusinduced encephalitis, B cells as well as virus-specific ASC and ASC of unknown specificities are found in the inflamed CNS [12-16]. Indirect evidence for intrathecal Ab synthesis includes oligoclonal Ab bands with restricted specificities in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) [14, 17, 18] . Increased CSF to serum Ab ratios detected following a variety of experimental CNS viral infections and measles virus-induced encephalitis in humans further support local Ab production [15, 19, 20] . Similarly, during acute MS the BBB is compromised, potentially allowing ASC recruitment [21, 22] . Only a small portion of the oligoclonal bands in MS CSF are specific for a defined Ag [18, 23, 24] , while the oligoclonal Ab bands in the CSF of SSPE patients are specific for measles virus [19, 20] . These data suggest that B cells are recruited into the CNS during acute peripheral infections with neurological involvement as well as during loss of BBB integrity associated with autoimmunity.

In contrast to the low frequencies of total virus-specific ASC in spleen and BM following CNS infection, peripheral infection resulted in substantially increased frequencies in the spleen as well as BM (Fig. 7B) . No ASC were detected in the CNS following peripheral infection, suggesting that in contrast to activated T cells [46] , activated B cells do not traffic into the CNS. Differences in ASC distribution were even more dramatic at the level of total number per tissue. Contrasting with the CNS infection (Fig. 7C) , the vast majority of virus-specific ASC localized to the spleen following peripheral infection (Fig. 7D) . Although total numbers of virus-specific ASC in BM of peripherally infected mice were lower than in spleen (Fig. 7D) , ASC numbers in BM still exceeded those in the CNS of infected mice (Fig. 7B) , suggesting no inherent defect in trafficking to BM. The overall paucity of peripheral ASC following CNS infection is consistent with limited viral Ag in lymphoid tissues and rapid recruitment into the CNS. Furthermore, enhanced virus-specific ASC elicited by peripheral viral infection presumably reflect higher viral Ag load.

Although the site of ASC differentiation is not resolved, kinetic parameters suggest initial activation in the periphery. Virus-specific ASC are detected in the lymphoid tissues prior to the CNS [16], similar to findings for T cells [30] . Consistent with their derivation from secondary lymphoid organ germinal centers, virus-specific ASC in the CNS emerge subsequent to germinal center reactions, which peak *12 days p.i. [4, 6] , and are sustained after viral Ag and inflammation have subsided. Assessment of plasmablast recruitment via their CD138 + phenotype revealed kinetics similar to those demonstrated by ELISPOT. Retained expression of CD19 and class II indicates migration at an early differentiation state. The subsequent relative increase in CD138 + cells and gradual loss of class II expression during the persistent state suggest ongoing local differentiation within the CNS and/or preferential survival of a more differentiated phenotype [21] . The former notion is supported by a substantially increased proportion of class II -CD138 + cells in spinal cords compared to brains at day 70 p.i. as well as increased spot size of ASC derived from brains at late compared to early times p.i. (data not shown). A role of CNS-localized persisting viral Ag in driving ASC differentiation and retention remains elusive. Intrathecal Ab secretion is associated with a variety of CNS infectious and autoimmune diseases and involves responses to self Ag as well as persisting microbial Ag [14, [51] [52] [53] . Although a small frequency of oligoclonal Ab in the CSF of MS patients are specific for Ag associated with viral infections acquired as young adults, the majority have as-yet-undefined specificities [18] . These data suggest that ASC can be retained within the human CNS for prolonged periods in the apparent absence of microbial Ag. However, a confounding issue is the role of self Ag in potentially propagating novel ASC subpopulations during chronic inflammation [23, 44] . During JHMV infection, virus-specific T cells decline rapidly as viral replication is controlled and Ag diminishes; nevertheless, T cell retention is prolonged in the continued presence of viral Ag/RNA [39] . In contrast, virus-specific ASC only reach peak levels after viral Ag is reduced to barely detectable levels and infectious virus is below detection limits. Their frequencies and total numbers subsequently also decline, albeit at a much reduced rate compared to T cells. These data imply distinct and largely Ag-independent ASC survival signals. Up-regulation of BAFF mRNA prior to peak ASC accumulation and a gradual concomitant decrease in BAFF mRNA levels and ASC after day 21 p.i. support BAFF as a likely candidate molecule required for ASC survival in the CNS [42, 44, 45] . Furthermore, the inability to detect CXCL13 weakens the concept of a potential role for local follicle formation in supporting de novo ASC generation, in contrast to involvement of this mechanism during chronic autoimmune disease [44] . In addition, ASC of multiple isotypes are retained within the CNS for prolonged periods following CNS JHMV infection [16] . Retention of IgM ASC in the CNS, persisting serum IgM and gradual accumulation in BM suggest a potential role for IgM in control of JHMV persistence, similar to other viral infections [48] . Irrespective of unique isotype patterns induced by distinct CNS infections, all isotypes can be sustained within the CNS [13] .

Preferential CNS retention, concomitant with poor BM accumulation, appears unique compared to localized infections of lung or intestinal tract [31, 33] and may reflect the primary role of intrathecal Ab in controlling viral persistence [13, 15, 16] . A prominent intrathecal Ab response to JHMV infection is supported by increased CFS to serum ratios of virus-specific antibodies in rats and mice [36] . In extreme cases, some animals only exhibited viral Ab in CSF and not in the corresponding serum [36] . Extremely limited ASC localization to BM suggests that ASC are diverted from a default trafficking pathway into the BM characteristic of peripheral infections [2] . Our data suggest that strong induction of both CXCL9 and CXCL10 within the CNS during acute infection mediates recruitment of CXCR3-expressing plasmablasts. Continued expression of these chemokines as virus is cleared may sustain ongoing recruitment as ASC continue to emerge from lymphoid organs. The elevated level of BAFF mRNA within the CNS supports induction of factors necessary for prolonged ASC survival [54] .

Importantly, the paucity of ASC in BM suggests that differentiating ASC are diverted and migrate toward virus-induced chemokines within the CNS. CXCL9 and CXCL10, early chemokines induced by JHMV [43] , are maintained during peak ASC recruitment and support a role for CXCR3 ligands in ASC recruitment. CXCL12 and BAFF, which are constitutively expressed at high levels in BM, may be candidates facilitating ASC retention in the CNS [6] . The recent discovery of BAFF up-regulation in CNS plaques associated with MS and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [44, 45] provides a mechanism for the promotion of ASC survival during CNS autoimmune disease. Similarly, following CNS infection, BAFF was up-regulated concurrently with viral clearance, and mRNA expression was maintained within the CNS throughout persistence.
