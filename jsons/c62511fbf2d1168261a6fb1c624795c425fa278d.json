Standard methods for 50 assessing autochthonous (local) transmission risk make either indirect estimates based on 51 ecological suitability or direct estimates only after local cases accumulate. However, an 52 overlooked source of epidemiological data that can meaningfully inform risk assessments prior 53 to outbreak emergence is the absence of transmission by imported cases. Here, we present a 54 method for updating a priori ecological estimates of transmission risk using real-time importation 55 data. We demonstrate our method using Zika importation and transmission data from Texas in 56 2016, a high-risk region in the southern United States. Our updated risk estimates are lower 57 than previously reported, with only six counties in Texas likely to sustain a Zika epidemic, and 58 consistent with the number of autochthonous cases detected in 2017. Importation events can 59 thereby provide critical, early insight into local transmission risks as infectious diseases expand 60 their global reach.",

Padmanabha et al. describe the 195 relationship between regional R 0 and the percentage of DENV cases generating over (p 20 ), as R 0 = 0.63 x 100 x (p 20 ) + 0.58. We assumed that p 20 = 1e-8 for 197 R 0 <0.58, and found that a single dispersion parameter captures this relationship for all R 0 values 198 and thus used k=0.12 for all analyses (Fig S2). 199 200 Updating posterior R 0 estimates 201 We estimated posterior distributions for \u03b1 , and each county-month R 0 for each day with a 202 new importation between January 2016 and January 2017. We assumed a uniform prior for \u03b1 of 203 U~(0,2), and used a blocked Gibbs sampling algorithm of MCMC. For each MCMC step we 204 provide the detected imported cases to date and propose each county-month R 0 , a single \u03b1 , and 205 a p d . County-month R 0 proposals were normally distributed around the previous sample with 206 standard deviation of 0.1, \u03b1 proposals were distributed U~(0,2), and we used a previously 207 estimated distribution for the reporting rate, p d ~ N(5.74%, sd=1.49%), which we assumed to not 208 vary spatiotemporally (24). We used the Metropolis-Hastings probability to accept or reject 209 proposals. Our chains consisted of 200,000 samples with a burn-in duration of 100,000; thinning 210 every 10 steps. Further algorithmic details and code are available on Github 211 (https://github.com/sjfox/rnot_updater). 212 213 Validating posterior county-month R 0 estimates 214 We derived the expected number of autochthonous cases from the importations data 215 through September of 2017 (at that time, the most recent importation was detected in mid-May) 216 and compared the estimates to the actual reported autochthonous cases. We integrated 217 uncertainty into our estimates by sampling from the posterior county-month R 0 distributions and 218 simulating outbreaks accordingly (full details in supplemental section II)R 0 updating using importation data.
