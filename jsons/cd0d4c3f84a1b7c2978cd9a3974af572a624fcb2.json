The characterization of potentially infectious bio-aerosols in the healthcare setting remains an important yet ill-defined factor in the transmission of respiratory viruses. Empiric data describing the distribution of bio-aerosols enable discernment of potential exposure risk to respiratory viruses. We sought to determine the distribution of influenza virus RNA emitted into the air by participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza, and whether these emissions had the potential to reach healthcare workers' breathing zones. Two-stage cyclone bio-aerosol samplers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health were placed 0.5-1.0 m (near field) and 2.1-2.5 m (far field) from infected patient participants, as well as in the corridor immediately outside their rooms. In addition, healthcare worker participants providing care to infected participants were recruited to wear a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter cassette in their breathing zones. Viral RNA was detected from the air emitted by 37.5% of the 16 participants infected with influenza virus and distributed both in near and far fields and in all tested particle sizes (<1 mm, 1-4 mm, and >4 mm). Viral RNA was recovered in droplet nuclei and beyond 1 m from naturally-infected participants in the healthcare setting and from the breathing zone of one healthcare worker. There was no correlation between patient participant nasal viral load and recovery of viral RNA from the air, and we did not identify any significant association between RNA detection from the air and patient demographics or clinical presentation. A more substantial study is required to identify patient determinants of virus emission into the air and delineate implications for evidence-based policy for prevention and control.

There is a lack of insight into the determinants of host bio-aerosol emission and spread of established and emerging pathogens. The importance of identifying means by which to control potentially infectious bio-aerosols was underscored by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, where the burden of illness and death was largely borne by healthcare workers. [1, 2] Part of the chaos which characterized the SARS-CoV epidemic can be attributed to a lack of knowledge regarding the route(s) of transmission of SARS-CoV and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Unfortunately, a similar scenario unfolded more recently in Saudi Arabia and South Korea where Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spread within healthcare institutions. [3, 4] Also, the first case of confirmed MERS-CoV in North America was in a healthcare worker. [5] The attack rate for HCWs working in units caring for MERS patients was 8% in one study, with radiology technologists, respiratory therapists, and nurses being at highest risk; 90% of these individuals reported being within 2 m of an infected patient. [6] Extensive environmental contamination during the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea was demonstrated, [7] which may in part explain super-spreading events for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. [8] Similarly, the annual spread of seasonal influenza virus within healthcare institutions poses an ongoing risk for patients, their families and healthcare workers. Approximately 17% of influenza cases are healthcareassociated, with 40% of these acquired in acute care settings. [9] Influenza virus RNA has been recovered from the breathing zones of 42% of participating emergency room workers, with nurses and nursing assistants experiencing the highest frequency of positivity, and viral RNA was detected from the personal breathing zones of all ten of the participant nurses involved in aerosol-generating procedures. [10] Influenza virus RNA has also been recovered from ambient air in acute care units and outpatient clinics, underscoring the potential for exposure across healthcare systems. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The conventional paradigm is to classify respiratory pathogen transmission as droplet vs. airborne, with clear policies and procedures for each purported mode of transmission. Where there is doubt, both droplet and airborne precautions are generally employed. Large respiratory droplets are >10 mm in diameter and are involved in short-range ( 2 m) droplet spread. Droplet nuclei are 5 mm and are responsible for short-or long-range (>2 m) airborne transmission; [15] these respirable particles are small enough to be inhaled into the alveoli. The relative contribution of each route to overall transmission of influenza is unknown, leading to debate regarding the important mode(s) of transmission and appropriate means of transmission prevention. [16, 17] In this paper, we use the term bio-aerosol to denote particles of any size presumed to originate from the respiratory tract.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 598, "end": 601, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 602, "end": 604, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1014, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1017, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1109, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1364, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1468, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1548, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1829, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2172, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2349, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2350, "end": 2354, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2355, "end": 2359, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2364, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2365, "end": 2369, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2833, "end": 2837, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3119, "end": 3123, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3124, "end": 3127, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Our primary goal was to determine the distribution of viral RNA by particle size and distance in an inpatient setting and establish whether influenza virus RNA could be recovered from HCWs' breathing zones.

No restrictions on visitors were placed during the sampling period, thus the possibility that household members or other visitors may have contributed viral RNA to the air is not excluded. We did not record the presence of other patients with influenza on the unit, or illness in staff, which may have contributed to detection of viral RNA, particularly in the corridor. Exact air exchanges/hour, ventilation direction, and flow rates were not determined and may have affected the particle distribution in the room and corridor. Also, although patient participants were on droplet precautions, consistency of door closure was not noted. Although these are important limitations, data collected under these uncontrolled conditions reflect that of the real world where other patient and HCW exposures actually occur. As with the majority of studies of this nature, we detected viral RNA, which is not a definitive indication of potential risk of infection after exposure. Experimental studies suggest that viable virus concentrations are several-fold lower than detected RNA copy concentrations. [33] In the clinical setting, differences may be due to technical or mechanical factors related to sampling and disruption of the viral envelope, or may be attributable to other biological factors, including the shedding of defective interfering viral particles (DI particles). [34] The role of DI particles in influenza virus transmission remains unclear, though there is evidence for a role in the transmission of other viruses. [35] As it stands, demonstration of infectious virus from aerosol samples remains the most convincing evidence for transmission potential. Even if viral RNA were to become a reliable indicator of exposure, translating these results to manage and reduce risk requires significantly more research, since little is known about transmission potential for given quantities of virus shed into the air. [36] Finally, this study represents a single center during a single influenza season. Although the sampling window included the influenza peak, the bulk of the sampling was done in February. Whilst H3N2 viruses predominated early in this particular season, H1N1 viruses emerged later and predominated the entire season. This is reflected in Table 1 showing that the majority of recruited participants were infected with H1N1 virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 565, "end": 569, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2641, "end": 2645, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2919, "end": 2923, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3072, "end": 3076, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3468, "end": 3472, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3809, "end": 3816, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Delays in identifying potential emitters presenting for acute care and noncompliance with infection prevention and control precautions may pose significant risks to HCWs providing direct patient care.

[37] Inconsistent application of infection prevention and control measures by both HCWs and patients has been studied, and there are opportunities for improvement among these groups, as well as from an administrative perspective. [38] [39] [40] The recovery of viral RNA in droplet nuclei and beyond 1 m from naturally-infected participants in the healthcare setting invites a concerted effort to address the issues of (a) virus viability and potential risk with exposure and (b) determinants of emission. The former poses methodological and technical challenges whereas the latter requires a collaborative, multidisciplinary and multicenter undertaking. A multicenter, multiseason study is required to determine the clinical, environmental, and viral factors associated with emission and dispersion of influenza virus.
