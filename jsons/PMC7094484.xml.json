Organ-specific receptors are activated during severe inflammation and this systemic reaction is called the acute-phase response [3]. In case the initial stimulus cleared unsuccessfully, a system-wide inflammation, even a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) will be started, and finally lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [4]. MODS is defined as the progressive dysfunction of two or more organs and is responsible for the majority of the morbidity and mortality among patients in intensive care units [5,6]. MODS unleashes complicated systemic reactions which is initiated simultaneously by host pattern recognition and endogenous signals. Then multiple signal pathways are activated which ultimately lead to over-expression of cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6 and affect cellular metabolism [[7], [8], [9]]. MODS involves disorders of endothelial system, immune system and coagulation system [10]. It is a much more complex situation than inflammation and SIRS [11]. It is critical to control inflammation in early stage and to avoid the progression into SIRS and MODS.",

MiRs have shown the effects to regulate inflammatory cytokines through several kinds of pathways including NF-\u03baB [[17], [18], [19]]. Several miRs, such as miR-125b, miR-146a, miR-15a, and miR-16, could prevent NF-\u03baB activation and prevent the translocation of the subunits to the nucleus [20,21]. It is reported that miR-9 is increased in pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) [[22], [23], [24], [25]]. Here we discuss the possible mechanism of microRNA-9 regulating severe inflammation.",

All the protocols were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines in the ethical permit that were accordance with the principles of ARRIVE approved by the Ethics Committee of Xijing Hospital, affiliated to the Fourth Military Medical University. In summary, we tried our best to lessen the numbers of animals involved and made sure that experienced researchers did the invasive manipulation. And during this process, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane inhalation.",

The levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 increased significantly in sirt1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 6\na) (p < 0.01). With the same dose of LPS injection, sirt1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice suffered much more serious organ injuries compared with WT mice as is shown in H&E staining. In TUNEL staining, the ratios of apoptotic of myocardium, liver, lung and kidney were about 19.5 \u00b1 0.2%, 18.2 \u00b1 0.5%, 22.3 \u00b1 0.5% and 19.0 \u00b1 0.3% separately in WT mice.

Tissues from heart, liver, lung and kidney were acquired from the other half anaesthetized and sacrificed mice at 72 h after LPS stimulation. H&E staining was used to assess organ damage (b).

The increasing prevalence of drug resistant compels us to find new and effective approaches for the diagnosis and therapy of severe inflammation [26]. MicroRNAs such as miR-9 have been reported to be involved in inflammation and to play an important role in preventing inflammation developing to MODS, while the specific mechanism is still unclear [[27], [28], [29], [30]]. In this study, we explored the potential effects of miR-9 on multiple organs injury in inflammation and the mechanism involved. Macrophages participate in the regulation of inflammatory responses and protect organ function damage [31,32]. We constructed an inflammation macrophages model and found the expression of pro-inflammation cytokines as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine increased significantly in LPS induced macrophages. MiR-9 also increased in this process, consistent with results drawn from previous study [27]. So we suspected that miR-9 might play a role in inflammation of LPS stimulated macrophages. To testify that, miR-9 inhibitor was used and the results showed that the suppression of miR-9 could inhibit inflammation and alleviate tissue damage induced by LPS.",

Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic roles of miR-9 have been deeply reported in tumors, by binding to corresponding genes, such as E-cadherin, SOCS5, HES1, CXCR4, TLN1, NF-\u03baB1 and so on [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37]]. Apart from tumor, miR-9 also plays an irreplaceable role in many kinds of inflammation. During viral infection, miR-9 was reported to act as a intermediary in NF-\u03baB activation induced by nucleocapsid protein of human coronavirus OC43 [38]. In human atherosclerosis inflammation cell models, miR-9 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation through JAK1/STAT signaling pathway [24]. In knee osteoarthritis, down-regulated miR-9 facilitate proliferation and anti-apoptosis of chondrocytes by directly binding to NF-\u03baB1 [39]. During inflammatory response following cerebral ischemia, miR-9 is down-regulated and up-regulated miR-9 relief inflammatory injury by inhibit the expression and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 [40], While others demonstrate that MCPIP1 is the direct target of miR-9 in microglial and the LPS-induced miR-9 promote microglial activation by MCPIP1-NF-\u03baB pathway [25]. In addition, the impacts of miR-9 on macrophage polarization were also noticeable [[41], [42], [43]]. MiR-9, the only miRNA (out of the 365 tested) consistently induced by LPS in a MyD88-and NF-\u03baB-dependent manner in both monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils [27], has been shown to promote M1 polarization by target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b4 (PPAR\u03b4) [23]. Furthermore, miR-9 mediated down-regulation of Dusp6 and enhanced ERK-mediated signal transduction was reported to involved in classical activation of CCL2 pre-treated macrophages [44].",

So TargetScan, PicTar and miRanda were used to explore the key gene in the downstream of miR-9 and found that SIRT1, a NAD+ dependent deacetylase enzyme, which was broadly reported to be a crucial gene in inflammation [45,46], was the potential target of miR-9. We found that down-regulation of miR-9 could increase the level of SIRT1, and vice verse. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay verified that SIRT1 was the target of miR-9. All in all, we have enough evidence to accept that SIRT1 was the downstream gene of miR-9.",
