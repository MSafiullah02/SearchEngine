Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. Methods: We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. Results: We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time > 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time > 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. Conclusion: The 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high.

First, they represent a conservative estimation, because the majority of patients was still on the ICU and therefore at risk after the described observation period. Also, VTE is more difficult to recognize in intubated patients with a higher threshold to perform diagnostic imaging tests because of strict isolation. If VTE screening had been applied, the incidence could have been even higher. We have to acknowledge that due to the design of the study, we could not adjust our findings for the actual administered doses of nadroparin, nor study the effect of the changes in the local protocols for thromboprophylaxis indicated in Table 2 . In view of this, our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, e.g. going from enoxaparin 40 mg OD to 40 mg BID, even in the absence of randomized evidence.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 679, "end": 686, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Finally, we propose that, rather than treating all patients with COVID-19 infections at the ICU with therapeutic anticoagulation, physicians should be vigilant for signs of thrombotic complications, and order appropriate diagnostic tests at a low threshold [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 260, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "FAK, MJHAK and MWH designed the study based on the observations of HE and DAMPJG.
