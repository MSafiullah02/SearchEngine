The major limitation in the field is often the availability of facilities and personnel. Rapid fluid administration can be challenging without appropriate height for hanging fluids, and catheters can easily be damaged or dislodged in stalls that are not appropriate for horses receiving intensive care. Safety of the personnel handling the horse is important and affected by adequate pain control in horses that are rolling or repeatedly getting up and down. The decision for antimicrobial use is often made without the benefit of complete laboratory testing results. Despite these limitations, field treatment has benefits, including familiar surroundings for the horse and more rapid initiation of treatment. The remainder of this article examines these 3 main areas of consideration when initiating field treatment of GI diseases in horses and foals.",

Diagnosis of a specific pathogen is unlikely to take place on the first visit to the farm, and therefore, antimicrobial use at initial treatment of adult horses is not routinely indicated unless there is a high suspicion for a specific bacterial focus. As further research is completed, these recommendations may change for specific diseases.
