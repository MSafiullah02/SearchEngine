The transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) is a balance between the benefits of maintaining oxygen delivery and the inherent risks from blood transfusion. The signs and symptoms of anemia vary based on the acuity of the anemia, compensatory change in blood volume, and the compensatory change in cardiac output from the patient\u2019s cardiovascular system. Chronic anemia is generally well tolerated due to compensatory expansion of intravascular plasma volume, increased cardiac output, vasodilatation, increased blood flow due to decreased viscosity, and not least, increased RBC 2,3 diphosphoglycerate, with a right shift of the oxygen dissociation curve, so that oxygen is unloaded to the peripheral tissues more readily. Symptoms of anemia are often nonspecific and can include fatigue, pallor, dizziness, headaches, vertigo, tinnitus, dyspnea, and inactivity. Fatigue particularly has been associated with poor quality of life.1\n",

Between 2007 and 2011, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) caused the highest percentage (43%) of fatalities reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), followed by hemolytic transfusion reactions (23%) caused by non-ABO- (13%) or ABO- (10%) incompatible blood transfusions.12\n",

The investigators found that the restrictive strategy resulted in a 44% decrease in the number of packed RBC transfusions without increasing rates of new or progressive multiorgan dysfunction, the primary outcome of the study. Several secondary outcomes, including sepsis, transfusion reactions, nosocomial respiratory infections, catheter-related infections, adverse events, length of stay in the ICU and hospital, and mortality were no different between the groups. The investigators recommended a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in pediatric patients who are stable in the ICU.28\n",

The primary, composite outcome (death, MI, or revascularization) occurred in 10.9% of the liberal transfusion cohort, compared with 25.9% of the restrictive cohort (P = .054); mortality occurred in 1.8% and 13.0%, respectively (P = .032). In addition, the TITRe2 trial, which focused on postoperative coronary artery bypass graft and valve surgery patients, found no difference in primary outcomes of ischemic events (MI, stroke, bowel infarction, acute kidney injury) or infection (sepsis or wound infection) between restrictive (Hb <7.5 g/dL) and liberal (Hb <9 g/dL) transfusion triggers (35.1% vs 33.0%, P = .30). However, they observed more deaths in the restrictive group as compared with the liberal group (4.2% vs 2.6%, P = .045).56 Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis stratifying study patients into \u201ccontext-specific\u201d risk groups based on patient characteristics and clinical setting found increased risk of inadequate oxygen delivery and mortality among patients with CVD undergoing cardiac or vascular surgery as well as elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.57 These trials50, 55, 57 provide evidence that a more liberal transfusion practice to maintain higher Hb thresholds may represent prudent management of high-risk patients who have symptomatic coronary artery disease or are undergoing cardiac surgery.",

The selection of a discrete Hb as a \u201ctrigger\u201d for RBC transfusion has been controversial.76 The guidelines generally acknowledge the necessity of considering patient covariables or other patient-specific criteria for making transfusion decisions.
