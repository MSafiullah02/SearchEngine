Trace detection of various analytes (indicators, additives, contaminants) with sufficient sensitivity and safety is the basic criteria of an NBS to be used. The detection limit in the laboratory is pushed to an atom when the atomic force microscopy is used. Thus, the enzymatic electrodes, studied and continuously perfected, use palliative such as concentrating the analyte of interest, which leads to major design and miniaturization difficulties.",

This means that only a specific analyte is able to enter the enzyme pocket. Enzymes can be used in NBSs as host receptors with molecular recognition capability but are unstable. To design host molecules that can be used in an NBS, the following criteria are considered: the host molecule must be stable under the conditions in which it is to be used, must be able to selectively bind the analyte in the sample, must be able to be immobilized in a film/membrane that is in contact with the sample, must signal that a host\u2013host binding response has occurred, and must ideally release the analyte after detection so the host is free to be reusable.

In enzymes, weak noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, dipole\u2013dipole, van der Waals, etc.) are used to link the guest into the enzyme pocket (interactions stabilize host\u2013guest interaction). Macrocycles contain polar functionalities, capable of interacting with guests via hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and dipole\u2013dipole interactions. It is desirable that bonding in the cavity is not strong, because it is important that the analyte, the guest, is released from the host after it has been detected and measured. Crown ethers and calixarene are ideal for bonding metal cations, based on the size of their cavity, but also on the high density of electrons present on the oxygen atoms in the cavity. The base compound selectively binds Li+ to other metallic cations; the modified version of the base macrocycle has a good selectivity for Na+. By synthetic modification it is possible to increase the capacity of the host cavity, and new functionalities can be introduced that will favor the binding of specific molecules and ions (da Silva et al. 2013).",

Both R and A represent distinct molecular species with high macromolecular specialization (antibodies, antigens, enzymes, receptors, etc.) or are complex systems (cells, tissues, etc.) (Kersten and Feilner 2007). After the active biological component, they can be grouped as follows:Enzymatic NBSs: Enzymes are energy proteins characterized by their catalytic function. Modified substrate molecules lead to oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis reactions that can be measured by enzymatic NBSs. Enzymatic NBSs produce a linear response depending on the substrate concentration. Immunosensors: Antibodies are glycoproteins produced by the immune system when an external substance, antigen, is involved. It is theoretically possible to produce antibodies without identifying an antigen. An immunosensor is a high sensitivity NBS. The principle of operation is based on the Ag\u2013Ab interaction of molecular recognition.NBSs with receptors: The regularity of biological processes is ensured by high sensitivity molecular processes based on the specialization of structural proteins (receptors) capable of recognizing a number of physiological signals. This is the case for neurotransmitters, whose action is mediated through the presence of receptors in the plasma membrane, in sites or cell targets. Activation of the biologically active site is via the ion channels. The acetylcholine receptor is the first known receptor in neurotransmitting phenomena.NBSs based on cells or tissues: Measurement of molecular species is not limited to interaction with the compounds to be analyzed; the transformations that occur can be measured as resulting products. It is desirable to operate with cell populations whose major metabolic pathways are known. Relevant is NBSs\u2019 L-arginine, which associates populations of bacterial cells of Streptococcus faecium in combination with an ammonia electrode. Arginine is metabolized by microorganisms. It is difficult to obtain complex reactions outside the cellular structures. Similar to the use of cell populations as sensitive elements, fragments or parts of plant tissues may be used. The advantage is greater because there is no extra effort to keep the cells viable in a natural arrangement. For adenosine NBSs, a tissue biosensitive element has been proposed. For dopamine NBSs, specialists have focused on the pulp of banana fruit, considering that it has remarkable biocatalytic properties.NBSs with redox proteins: The redox proteins are involved in biochemical processes such as cellular respiration and photosynthesis reaction (Kersten and Feilner 2007).",

The analysis of these reactions results in two important conclusions:At a low concentration of the substrate, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the substrate concentration and inversely proportional to the rate of the formation and extinction rate of the complex or the dissociation reaction rate in the initial reactants plus the decomposition reaction rate in products.At a high concentration of the substrate, maximum speed is limited by enzyme concentration. Thus, the two sequences correspond to the two processes that can control the overall reaction rate (Stein et al. 2011).",

When the enzyme is immobilized on the electrode, the need for the organic reducer is prevented by the electrode itself providing the reducing equivalences. The coupling of peroxidase with an enzyme oxidase allows for the construction of bienzymatic systems through which the peroxide produced by the oxidase is detected by the electrode\u2013peroxidase system which operates at lower potentials relative to a simple platinum electrode. This is where the minimization of active species interferences results from (Frederickson Matika and Loake 2014).",

Another possible application is to appreciate the color or integrity of the vascular tissues. Optic-fiber NBSs can now monitor electrolytes from raw or elaborated sap as well potassium, sodium, and calcium.

Chloroplasts also have these reactions after they have been removed from the plants, but after a few hours, they break down because light and oxygen destroy their photosynthetic proteins.

By wrapping the particles into polyacrylic acid, a heavily charged molecule allowed the particles to penetrate the lipid hydrophobic membranes surrounding the chloroplasts. In these chloroplasts, the level of decomposition of molecules has decreased tremendously. Using the same technique, the researchers introduced semiconductor carbon nanotubes embedded in negatively charged DNA into chloroplasts. Plants use only one tenth of the available sunlight, but carbon nanotubes have functioned as artificial antennas that have allowed chloroplasts to capture unusual light waves such as green, ultraviolet, and near infrared. When carbon nanotubes functioned as prosthetic photoabsorbents, photosynthesis, measured by the activity of electrons in tilacloids, was 49% more intense than in chloroplasts isolated without attached nanotubes. When cerium oxide was joined with carbon nanotubes, the chloroplasts remained active for the next few hours (Nikolelis et al. 2008). Researchers went to live plants and used a technique called vascular infusion to attach nanoparticles to Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flower plant. Using the above method, the researchers applied a nanoparticle solution on the lower side of the leaf, penetrating the stomata that usually allow the carbon dioxide to get in and the oxygen out. In these plants, the nanotubes have penetrated into chloroplasts and have increased the photonic electron circuit by about 30%. It is also to be discovered how these percentages influence the sugar production of plants. Scientists have been able to transform the Arabidopsis thaliana plant into a chemical NBS by implanting nanotubes that detect nitric oxide, a pollutant produced by combustion (Hines et al. 2015).",

In the case of potato, the control program for certain diseases, such as the rot caused by Phytophthora infestans, had to be abandoned because the resistance to this disease of potato plants obtained by transferring the 11 resistance genes on the basis of crossbreeds with the Solanum demissum species proved to be of short duration. Identifying genes of resistance in the genome of different plant species and transferring them to other crop plants are extremely difficult and time-consuming if traditional methods (intra- and interspecific hybridizations) are used.

As it has already been mentioned, few R-genes have been shown to provide a lasting control of plant diseases. This is the case for pepper Bs2 genes and rice Xa21 which provide resistance to different phytopathogenic strains of X. campestris or X. oryzae in the case of species in which the genes have been cloned (e.g., tomatoes). Resistance to these genes is due to the recognition of proteins produced by bacteria or phytopathogenic fungi, resulting in the occurrence of a plant hypersensitivity phenomenon and necrosis of affected tissues. Another example of the long-acting R-gene is the barley recessive mlo gene which provides the resistance of the plants containing it to all E. graminis strains, through the accumulation in plant cells of a phenolic antifungal compound named p-coumaroylhydroxyagmatine.",
