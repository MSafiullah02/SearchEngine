This illness has already been assigned the name coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO).1 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a family of viruses that cause a variety of symptoms that range in severity from mild cold symptoms to more severe infections, which disproportionately account for a high mortality rate among the elderly and individuals that are immunocompromised. The pandemic has now reached almost every country on the globe (at least 199 countries at the time of writing). The epidemiological variability and lethality of COVID-19 in general and specific populations have been reported.2,3 The world is currently witnessing substantial disruption of daily lives socially, psychologically and economically as a result of the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Various countries have instituted diverse policies and laws to protect their citizens as the natural history of the disease progresses. However, just as we witness differences in the degree of public health preparedness across nations, we are also subdued by the lack of simple epidemiological tools that could capture, in broad terms, the comparative effectiveness of measures put in place by different countries to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on human lives. In this paper, we present a simple epidemiological tool that could be utilized globally to test the relative efficiency of measures put in place to avert death resulting from COVID-19 infection. For simplicity, we refer to this assessment tool as the Pandemic Efficiency Index or PEI. The PEI could be used to potentially rank countries and assist in distilling best practices from those countries with optimal outcomes in a pandemic. The higher the PEI, the greater the efficiency of the country in protecting its citizens from death resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Using PEI, nations can learn and adapt best practices in pandemic control from each other. Nations can systematically reverse-engineer the practices that countries with higher PEI used to achieve lower Covid-19-related mortality.",

For example, China had a total of 81,439 cases and 3,300 deaths, yielding a mortality rate of 0.0405 or 4.05%. Italy had 97,689 cases and 10,779 deaths, corresponding to a mortality rate of 0.1103 or 11.03%. Therefore, .

The WHO had estimated COVID-19 mortality rate to be 3.4% about three weeks ago7. However, due to the rapid progression of the disease and differential efficiency in disease and mortality prevention across affected countries, the mortality rate had risen to 4.72% as of March 29, 2020. COVID-19 has been more deadly than the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which registered a case fatality rate of 0.2%. For the first time since the outbreak, Wuhan in China reported no new cases on March 19th 2020, while the USA acquired the status of the country reporting the largest number of new COVID-19 infections worldwide. According to various analyses by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), older adults and those with underlying comorbidities like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes are more vulnerable to the severe forms of COVID-19 and to die from the disease.8 From our results, we observed that citizens of countries that performed worse on our PEI scale (i.e., had low PEI) such as Italy, Spain, UK etc. had a higher median age than their counterparts from other parts of the world. What was most surprising was the low mortality rate (0.79%) and the highest PEI (5.09) of Germany, in spite of the fact that it ranks 4th in the world for the highest median age.9 Austria and Portugal were the other two countries with a high PEI and median age above 44 years.",
