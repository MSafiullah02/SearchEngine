            "text": "Neonatal period in the canine species, defined as the first three weeks of life, is a critical period with high risk of mortality: about 10% of all live-born puppies die between birth and 21 days of age (Mugnier et al., 2018). Survival rate during this period depends on the ability of the newborn to adapt to the extra-uterine life. Once cardiorespiratory system has been able to switch from a placental to an aerial oxygen provision, the newborn dog goes through new challenges, both immune and nutritional. From the nutritional point of view, the circulation of nutrients via placenta is interrupted at birth; nutrients supply relies on implementation of new strategies by the newborn, including mammary gland approach, suckling and milk digestion. The immune situation of the newborn dog is critical, as the endotheliochorial structure of the placenta drastically limits transplacental transfer of macromolecules, including immunoglobulin G (IgG), to the newborn\u2019s bloodstream. Whereas exposed to high concentrations of infectious agents immediately after birth when delivered out of the uterus, puppies are born with very low systemic immunity, with mean serum IgG concentration at about 0.3 g/L versus 8\u201325 g/L in the adult dog (Poffenbarger et al., 1991; Bouchard et al., 1992; Chastant-Maillard et al., 2012; Mila et al., 2014a). Transfer of passive immunity from dam to the offspring is thus essentially lactogenic in the canine species, colostrum ensuring both nutrients and immunity provision: at two days of age, mean serum IgG concentration in the puppy rises up to 6\u201316 g/L, with 85\u201395% of the immunoglobulins originating from the colostral transfer (Pollock and Carmichael, 1982; Poffenbarger et al., 1991; Sch\u00e4fer-Somi et al., 2005a; Greene and Schultz, 2006; Day, 2007; Chastant-Maillard et al., 2012; Fig. 1\n). Even when evaluated to its maximum (two days of age), immunoglobulins concentrations or specific antibody titers acquired by the puppy after colostrum intake remain lower than in the adult dog, reaching between 50 and 77% of the maternal level (Mila et al., 2014a; Gillespie et al., 1958).",

Indeed, the prevalence of the deficit in PIT varies strongly among kennels, but may vary also among breeds, as only 4 out of 90 Labrador puppies (4.4%) presented IgG concentration below 2.3 g/L (unpublished data). In case of free suckling (uncontrolled by the breeder), quality of PIT is strongly variable among litters, but also among puppies from the same litter, both evaluated via serum IgG concentration (general immunity) and via CPV2-specific antibody titer (specific immunity; Fig. 2\n) (Mila et al., 2014b).",

IgG assay performed via an immuno-enzymatic method (ELISA - Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) is not an automated process and requires about six hours of laboratory work, limiting its use to scientific purposes. In practice, PIT can be evaluated indirectly through blood gamma-glutamyltransferases (GGT) activity at two days of age: GGT activity in canine colostrum is ten times higher than that in the female blood, whereas GGT activity in puppies\u2019 serum at birth is almost absent. Any increase of GGT activity in the newborn\u2019s serum is indicative of an ingestion of colostrum (Center et al., 1991), with an activity below 62U/L diagnosing a deficit in PIT with a 87.5% sensitivity and a 80% specificity (Mila et al., 2017b). PIT can be also evaluated via specific antibody titer. Indeed, at two days of age, serum IgG concentration and CPV2 specific-antibody titer are positively correlated, with concordant diagnosis of adequate PIT in 88% of puppies; adequate PIT was defined as IgG concentration >2.3 g/L for general immunity and CPV2-antibody titer >1:80 for specific immunity evaluation (Mila et al., 2018).",

Namely, all above mentioned methods require blood sampling of the newborn, in Newfoundland puppy of mean birth weight of 630 g, as well as in a 120 g Chihuahua (mean birth weight in France, A. Mugnier, personal communication). Knowing that dog breeders are forbidden to draw blood samples in most countries, and taking into account the cost of veterinary consultation (ideally at the kennel, since speaking of two-day-old puppies) and the cost of the blood test itself, such blood screening cannot be implemented in practice. An easier and costless method of indirect PIT evaluation is early growth monitoring, i.e. the percentage of weight gain from birth to two days of age, since colostrum provides together energy and immunoglobulins. A growth rate over the first two days of life below \u22122.7% allowed to identify the deficit of PIT in 87\u201396% of cases, both in terms of general (IgG) and specific (CPV2-specific antibodies) immune transfer (Table 1\n; Mila et al., 2018).",

As IgM, IgA are mainly produced locally by the lymphocytes of the mammary tissue (Hurley and Theil, 2011). Once ingested into the gut, IgA participate locally in the immune defense mechanisms of the digestive epithelium. Apart from this local role, a part of IgA passes through the intestinal wall, being absorbed into the bloodstream and subsequently redistributed onto the mucous surfaces, digestive or not (Salmon et al., 2009; Chastant-Maillard et al., 2012); they thereby participate for example in the immune defense of the respiratory tract. IgA concentration in the colostrum is between five and ten times higher than in adult serum, whereas that of IgM is much lower than in the serum, only about 15\u201325% of the serum concentration (Day, 2007).",

On the maternal side, colostrum IgG concentration drops dramatically after whelping with a mean decrease of 60% (\u00b118%) between 4 and 24 h post-partum (Albaret et al., 2016). For the neonate\u2019s part, intestinal barrier closure is one of the main factors determining the quality of PIT. Histological description of this phenomenon, non available in the dog, is known in the bovine and porcine species. At birth, tight junctions between enterocytes as well as brush border of these cells are undeveloped. Macromolecules, including immunoglobulins, can pass through digestive mucosa and be absorbed into the lymph and later into the bloodstream. This transport seems to be non specific and most probably independent from Fc\u03b3Rn receptors (Cervenak and Kacskovics, 2009). Bioavailability of colostral immunoglobulins is highly due to a weak proteolytic activity of the digestive system at birth, immature digestive microbiota but also thanks to a high concentration of trypsin inhibitors in the ingested colostrum (1000 times higher than in the mature milk in the cow) (Levieux and Ollier, 1999). As early as birth, over the first hours of life intestinal permeability decreases: puppies at birth absorb in average 40% of ingested IgG, whereas absorption rate drops at 20% 4 h later, and at only 9% 12 h later. After the first 12\u201316 h of life, IgG absorption rate is absent (Chastant-Maillard et al., 2012).",

Depending on their specificity, maternally derived antibodies (MDA) persist until 10\u201315 days of life (Gooding and Robinson, 1982; Pollock and Carmichael, 1982; Greene and Schultz, 2006; Mila et al., 2014b). In the dog, the MDA concentration falls at 1 to 3% of the initial level as early as 30 days after birth (Chappuis, 1998). However, this drop of circulating MDA tends to be accelerated in presence of pathogens in the environment or due to repeated vaccinations, by consumption within the immune response. Immune complexes formed are then secreted into the intestinal lumen through Fc\u03b3Rn receptors (Rath et al., 2013; Greene and Schultz, 2006). The postnatal drop in MDA seems breed-dependent, with shorter half-time in rapidly growing puppies (Chappuis, 1998). In parallel to the decrease in MDA, the newborn dog is able to produce its own antibodies since birth, with a significant increase of antibody concentration visible as early as 14\u201321 days of age (Fig. 1).",

They may put at risk some vulnerable puppies (i.e. with failure of PIT), if introduced into a kennel na\u00efve to CPV2. Indeed, MDA persistence at the time of vaccination at about 8 weeks of age is problematic to dog breeders. Although puppies are able to produce antibodies in response to natural infection or vaccination since birth (and even during the fetal life), seroconversion occurs only in the presence of very low levels of specific MDA (Gooding and Robinson, 1982; Chappuis, 1998; Toman et al., 2002; Day, 2007). A so called immunological gap appears, with remaining MDA preventing the mount of a correct response to vaccination whereas no more providing puppy with adequate immune protection (Decaro et al., 2005). Among 88 puppies vaccinated against CPV2 between 8 and 10 weeks of age, eight puppies did not develop a protective response due to the presence of MDA (Thibault et al., 2016). Taking into account the late presence of colostral MDA, a third vaccination at about 16 weeks of age was implemented in 2015 into the international recommended vaccination protocol (WSAVA, 2015; Day, 2017).",

Colostrum -and later, milk- contributes to local digestive immunity by IgA, participating into the enteropathogens neutralization within the intestinal lumen. Except IgA, other nonspecific colostral compounds, such as lysozyme and lactoferrin, participate in the newborn immune response, even though they are considered of minor importance (Handl et al., 2009). In other domestic animals, white blood cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes are other compounds of the PIT: these cells are able to cross the intestinal barrier and enhance neonatal immunity during the first month of life (Liebler-Tenorio et al., 2002; Langel et al., 2015, 2016). They release IgA locally when in contact with digestive pathogens (Wheeler et al., 2007). Globally, colostrum increases the digestive immunity thanks to the presence of non-specific antimicrobial factors, controls the development of the digestive microbiota, modulate development of Peyer\u2019s patches and digestive epithelium, participate in the adequate immune response. Stimulation of the intestinal immune system (the most developed one of the entire organism) during the first days of life is essential to adapt the immune response and to limit infections, inflammatory diseases and allergies (Kelly and Coutts, 2000; Rogier et al., 2014). Facing the marked unexplained increase in the prevalence of dysimmune diseases and inflammatory processes (including obesity) in the dog (Sundburg et al., 2016; Banfield, 2018), the impact of systemic, but also digestive immunity established during the first days of life on the long-term health remains to be investigated.",

In case of oral administration of canine serum to colostrum-deprived newborn puppies, the increase in their blood IgG concentration was insignificant compared with that achieved after ingestion of maternal colostrum and below the threshold defining failure in PIT (Poffenbarger et al., 1991; Bouchard et al., 1992; IgG threshold at 2.3 g/L from Mila et al., 2014a). Oral administration of the canine plasma during the first eight hours after birth to puppies with free access to the dam and the colostrum did not allow to reduce the proportion of puppies at deficit of PIT (Mila et al., 2014a), but a tendency for a lower morbidity rate in supplemented puppies was observed (Mila et al., 2017a). Only parenteral administration, with associated risks, was suggested to allow PIT: a subcutaneous injection of 2 ml or 4 mL/100 g body weight at birth allowed to reach mean IgG concentrations of respectively 2.6 and 4.5 g/l (Bouchard et al., 1992). However, some severe lesions have been reported after such a treatment: \u201cimpressive subcutaneous pockets of liquid\u201d according to Bouchard et al.

These antibodies (called IgY, for yolk immunoglobulins) are secreted in the egg yolk at high concentrations and can thus be easily available, in large amounts and in a non invasive way. Benefits of CPV2-specific and E. coli-specific IgY on the canine neonate have been recently demonstrated, as large breed puppies receiving IgY orally once before the intestinal barrier closure presented greater growth rate over the neonatal period (D0-D21) than controls: 824 \u00b1 349 g in IgY supplemented puppies vs 662 \u00b1 334 g in controls, n=334 puppies (Mila et al., 2017a). Such colostrum alternative containing CPV2-specific and E. coli-specific IgY is available for dog breeders (PuppyProTech, Royal Canin, Aimargues, France). IgY supplementation is a strategy validated in other species (but after intestinal barrier closure; Diraviyam et al., 2014) and promising for the canine newborns since IgY directed against numerous canine pathogenic bacteria (as for example Salmonella), viruses (canine coronavirus CCoV, canine herpesvirus CHV1 \u2026) and parasites (Giardia) could be produced. IgY half-life in the puppy\u2019s bloodstream is unknown to date, but probably short, as the half-life of IgY administrated to piglets at 10 h of life was of 1.85 h versus 12 days for homologous IgG (Yokoyama et al., 1993). Nevertheless, the effect of IgY administration in the newborn probably relies not only on passive immune transfer, and its role on the digestive microbiota and digestive immune competences are to be explored.",
