There is an additional mutation at residue 19 in H. pylori ferritin to abolish a potential N-glycosylation site. There were extra GS residues at the carboxyl terminus of H. pylori ferritin.

To construct soluble gp350 ectodomain and D 123 , the gene fragments were fused with bPRL and tagged with hexa-histidine at the end. The CR2BS mutant gp350s were made by site-directed mutagenesis (W162N and N164T for glyc162; and additional D208N and E210T for glyc 162/208 to introduce N-glycosylation sites at 162 and 208).

Cryo-EM images of the D 123ferritin and D 123 -encapsulin were acquired on an FEI Titan Krios operated at 300 keV and a CM200 FEG microscope operated at 200 keV, respectively. The electron dose for data collection was \u223c20 e -/\u00c5 2 , and the image was defocused by \u223c2-3 \u03bcm. The defocus and the astigmatism of each micrograph were estimated with the program EMAN1 fitctf and further confirmed with the ctfit. Image processing and three-dimensional reconstruction were performed using about 1,000 particles with the EMAN suite of programs (Baker et al., 2010) . The final reconstruction was computed and was low-pass filtered to 30 \u00c5 in resolution. The EM density of the gp350 in the D 123 -ferritin was extracted from the difference map between the D 123 -ferritin and native ferritin using the UCSF Chimera package.
