            "text": "\u201cPneumonia of an unknown cause\u201d was first reported to the WHO Office in China on 31 December 2019 [2]; yet weeks earlier, healthcare professionals had warned Chinese authorities that a SARS-like illness was spreading amongst patients. Instead of notifying those higher in the system, Wuhan authorities detained and silenced physician Dr Li Wenliang on a charge of spreading false rumours after he reported a novel illness in his patients in early December [3]. At age 34, Dr Li passed away in February 2020 from COVID-19 infection [3]. This tragedy highlights the critical importance of honesty and transparency. Modelling data suggests that if action had been taken even a few days earlier, the subsequent spread of the virus could have been limited dramatically. However, fears of economic and political repercussions silenced officials who could have sounded alarms, and the virus was able to spread exponentially. Other countries have also struggled to communicate the epidemiology of this new infection, sometimes reflecting the challenges of ensuring consistent and coherent messaging in a fast moving situation, sometimes due to internal disagreements,5 but sometimes, for example in Brazil and the United States, by blatantly misleading comments [4] by political leaders and the media [4]. These too have consequences. President Trump\u2019s praise for hydroxychloroquine, despite an absence of evidence of effectiveness in COVID-19, meant that people who did need it, such as those with lupus, have faced shortages [5]. A lack of transparency around the United Kingdom\u2019s scientific advisory mechanism has undermined trust [6].",

Yet countries have moved at different speeds and intensity, often without consulting their neighbours. These responses sometimes seem disconnected from the epidemiological evidence; some countries which have similar disease \u2018curves\u2019 are reacting very differently. The strict legally backed lockdown measures implemented in China and South Korea early in their outbreaks contrast with the dismissal of the risks of coronavirus, accompanied, at least initially, by reluctance to impose stringent restrictions by some politicians in the UK and the US. In places with \u2018softer\u2019 initial responses (i.e. France, UK) the rapid increase in cases forced reassessments, with adoption of increasingly severe measures to protect health systems at risk of collapse.",

Coronavirus, like all infectious agents, ignores geopolitical boundaries and attacks people regardless of nationality; we too must take a unified approach which transcends geopolitical boundaries both to tackle the virus and to transition out of market closures and lockdowns. As countries consider lifting these measures, they must consult with one another and avoid making decisions in isolation. At the same time, they should also steer away from \u2018one fits all\u2019 solutions, and governments must consider their domestic cultures and contexts before ultimately defining a \u2018new normal\u2019. The European Union has published a roadmap setting out the principles that should underpin decisions to open up, noting that health policy is a national competence, but decisions should be discussed and communicated with neighbouring member states [10].",

The first virtual G7 and G20 virtual meetings did not occur until mid-March \u2013 months after the outbreak began in China. And even when these discussions did take place, consensus lacked on a unified approach to COVID-19. When the G7 met on 25 March, instead of agreeing upon coordinated and collaborative responses to the virus, disputes broke out about who was most to blame for the crisis and a post-meeting joint statement could not be put together [11]. Subsequently, the USA blocked a statement by the G20 restating the global leadership role of WHO [12]. In this, and in future epidemic and pandemic responses, policymakers at the highest level need to engage with each other early on to develop a coherent and unified responses.

When the outbreak began to ramp up in Europe in March, France and Germany banned the export of protective personal equipment (PPE) amidst severe shortages of such equipment elsewhere [13,16]. China, after having weathered the worst of the outbreak, is one of the few countries showing signs of solidarity and providing support to other countries by donating PPE and lending medical staff, a form of soft power that will not go unnoticed in the future [17].

Thus far, the WHO has done its best to communicate its messages effectively and has carefully escalated the terminology around SARS-CoV-2 from outbreak, to epidemic, and to pandemic, based on available evidence. While these efforts are commendable, the pandemic has highlighted the need for some refocusing and increased funding to ensure the WHO is capable of coordinating global responses to major health challenges, including the capacity to provide even greater operational support where this is needed.

Yet while health systems are essential to human wellbeing (as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic), the responsiveness and resilience of health systems to epidemics and pandemics are rarely tested. Thus, as SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the world, health systems have been shocked and found underprepared: countries such as the US, which relies on China for the manufacture of over two thirds of the active pharmaceutical ingredients used in the American generics market [26], are highly dependent on well-functioning supply chains and face threats of drug shortages when manufacturers elsewhere are unable to do their jobs because of lockdowns and quarantines. Crucially, if systems are tested and weaknesses identified, something must be done. Unfortunately, this often does not occur in practice. For example, after a major exercise in the UK in 2016 exposed a shortage of ventilators, the issue was ignored [27]. Once the current COVID-19 pandemic is under control, health systems should be tested just like banks are to ensure they are resilient, and that any weaknesses are addressed.",

This \u2018perceived secrecy\u2019 has undermined trust in many leaders.

While it is essential to cut waste within health systems, this pandemic highlights the need to have adequate capacity to address and tackle a crisis.
