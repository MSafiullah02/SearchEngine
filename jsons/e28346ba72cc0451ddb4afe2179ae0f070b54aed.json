Radiographs indicated the presence of a mass in the anterior thorax. A response to edrophonium chloride, and raised levels of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in the serum, confirmed the diagnosis and indicated an immune-mediated aetiology. Clinical remission occurred following thymectomy and the use of immunosuppressive corticosteroids. This is the first fully-documented case of acquired feline myasthenia gravis associated with the presence of a thymic abnormality in the United Kingdom. The clinical features, laboratory findings and response to treatment are compared with those reported previously in cats and other species.",

            "text": "Myasthenia gravis in man is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission caused by a relative reduction in the number of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the muscle membrane. It is thought to be immune-mediated primarily through IgG anti-AChR antibodies which bind at the neuromuscular junction and result in AChR loss via antibody induced modulation, enhanced by elements of the complement system (Drachman 1978 , Engel 1984 , Lindstrom 1985 . It has been postulated that an infection with either a viral or bacterial agent may trigger development of the condition, perhaps as a result of molecular mimicry in susceptible individuals (Dwyer and others 1986, Schwimmbeck and others 1989 ), but at present there is little direct evidence for involvement of such a trigger in human patients. In addition an association with thymic abnormalities is recognised in approximately 75 per cent of cases. In 85 per cent of these cases the thymic abnormality is found to be hyperplasia while the remaining 15 per cent are classified as thymomas (Drachman 1978) .",

A chest drain was inserted for 36 hours postoperatively and the cat's recovery was uneventful.

The dose of prednisolone was then reduced over the subsequent six weeks to 1.5 mglkg on alternate days, at which time the cat was re-examined. The cat had made good progress, with a return to normal appetite and previous behaviour patterns, including exploration of outdoor territory. On clinical examination it was bright and exhibited no neuromuscular fatigue. However, there was no weight gain (2.7 kg), coat condition was poor, and it was treated for tapeworm infestation.

In humans and dogs, circulating antibodies to acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction are detectable in approximately 90 per cent of cases.

Thymic abnormalities are recognised in approximately 75 per cent of humans with myasthenia gravis (Drachman 1978) although in only 15 per cent of these is the thymic change classified as a thymoma. In the remaining 85 per cent the thymic changes are considered to represent hyperplasia with germinal follicles in the medulla (Henry 1978) . In a series of 22 dogs with thymomas only one had evidence of cystic change (Bellah and others 1983) . A review of reported cases of thymoma in the cat (Carpenter and others 1987) suggests that at least 50 per cent have a marked cystic component. There have been two welldocumented reports of feline myasthenia gravis associated with thymic abnormalities (Van Oosterhout and others 1989, Scott-Moncrieff and others 1990). In these cases the thymic masses were described as thymomas. The authors feel that this present case probably represents cystic change in an enlarged thymus rather than a thymoma.",

In cases without a thymoma there is usually a clear benefit provided surgery is carried out early on in the course of the disease. However, if a thymoma is present the prognosis appears to be far more guarded. In humans, delayed and, or, poor response to thymectomy in some cases suggests that T-cells, controlling antibody formation by Bcells, continue activity in some extra-thymic site for some time after thymectomy. In these cases, it is thought that the use of immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids may be as beneficial as, or even more so, than thymectomy. In humans, steroid therapy is always continued after the removal of a thymoma as this appears to improve survival time and nearly all patients require indefinite continuation of low level steroid maintenance therapy (Drachman 1978).",

On clinical examination the following were found: marked hyperflexion of the right hip and stifle when walking; coxofemoral joint pain and crepitus; bilateral muscle atrophy of the hindlimbs; decreased range of hip movement. Hindlimb postural reaction deficits and decreased flexor reflex indicated ischiatic nerve involvement. EMG findings confirmed this. Exploratory surgery found the ischiatic nerve trapped between the sacrotuberous ligament and bone and soft tissue around the hip joint. The nerve was decompressed by resecting the sacrotuberous ligament. One year afterwards the dog was essentially normal. ",

Pupils were dilated and unresponsive. Localised fasciculation of muscle groups occurred. Treatment consisted of intravenous fluids at two to three times maintenance, together with intravenous dexamethasone and flunixin meglumine. Intravenous diazepam controlled mild seizures and tremors. Two days later the animal began responding to its name. By the fourth day the dog could walk with difficulty. Treatment was continued with corticosteroids on a tapering dosage regime. Gradual improvement was made and the dog was clinically normal 12 days after the first signs. ",

The masses were poorly separated from the surrounding hepatic parenchyma. In cross section they had a fatty appearance. Histological diagnosis was myelolipoma.
