            "text": "The prevalence of ECs, or vaping, is increasing worldwide. Data shows increased use of e-cigarettes between 2011 to 2018 of 1.5 to 20.8% among high school students, an estimated increase from approximately 220,000 to 3.05 million high school students. Between 2017 and 2018, e-cigarette use was found to have increased 78% [1]. ECs are marketed as the \u201csafe alternative\u201d to smoking due to the belief that vaping could be a \u201charm reduction\u201d alternative to smoking to the same degree as other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved nicotine replacement therapies [2]. Vaping companies promote consumer attestations that ECs helped them quit smoking and improved their overall health [3]. These proclamations are controversial as there is sparse literature to show that EC users were more likely to quit smoking than regular cigarette users [4, 5]. There is a concern that ECs could increase worldwide nicotine dependence, especially among young adults who are enticed by the many flavors ECs offer [6]. The medical community is apprehensive of vaping and advises caution since limited scientific evidence is available to show their efficacy and safety [6]. We present three cases of pneumonitis seen at our small community hospital that further supports the harmful effects of ECs.",

The course of the disease process typically begins with pulmonary symptoms of nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and/or shortness of breath lasting over several days to weeks before the patient is hospitalized. All patients described in these reports had abnormal imaging that included infiltrates on chest radiograph and ground-glass opacities on chest CT scan. Gastrointestinal findings include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea have also been seen in these patients. Many patients, due to the nonspecific symptoms, received an initial diagnosis of infection and were treated with empiric antibiotics, which did not lead to improvement. One of the most severe symptoms that led to hospitalization was hypoxemia, which in some cases progressed to acute or subacute respiratory failure [2]. Patients in these cases needed multiple supplemental therapies, including supportive oxygen, endotracheal intubation, or even mechanical ventilation. The therapy that showed the most improvement in these patients was corticosteroids.",

Both vaping induced pneumonitis and acute eosinophilic pneumonia have imaging that resemble bacterial pneumonia. Both diseases cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. They can each progress to necessitating ICU admissions. However, a main difference between the two conditions revolves around the research that has been conducted to this point. The main mechanism of acute eosinophilic pneumonia has been elucidated to be due to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, and tumor necrosis factor. This combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines is thought to be the inciting event in this disease process, which leads to the eosinophil-rich exudate within the alveoli [7, 8]. The main mechanism of action of vaping induced pneumonitis, however, has not been elucidated to this point. Further research may focus on elucidating this mechanism so as to create better treatments for this condition.",

According to FDA reports, e-cigarette cartridges and solutions contain a mixture of contaminants that can be harmful to humans, including nitrosamines and diethylene glycol [10]. THC, the principal psychoactive component of cannabis, is noted by the CDC to be a product that can be delivered via e-cigarettes [1]. Of note, cannabis was a consistent finding among the patients in this case series. No e-cigarette product, substance, or additive was consistently identified among the cases that have been reported [9, 11]. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that THC containing e-cigarettes may be a principal cause in the pathophysiology of vaping induced pneumonitis, even if no specific substance has been identified as the principal cause thus far.",
