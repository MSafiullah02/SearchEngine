            "text": "Influenza viruses are a leading cause of acute respiratory infection and represent a considerable public health burden worldwide (Reed et al., 2015, The PMS, 2016). Humans are commonly infected by influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) and B viruses, which often co-circulate during epidemics. Vaccination against influenza viruses is one of the most effective strategies to minimize the risk of infection. Seasonal influenza vaccines are recommended for young children and the elderly because these groups are at high risk of influenza virus infection and its associated complications (Souty et al., 2015). Despite seasonal vaccination, influenza virus infection remains associated with high morbidity and mortality rates (Simonsen, 1999). This is due to continuous antigenic changes in the surface glycoproteins of influenza virus strains, which reduce the effectiveness of vaccination (de Vries et al., 2016, Webster and Govorkova, 2014).",

However, these drugs are only effective when started within the first 48 h of the illness (Stiver, 2003). Consequently, effective use of antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza virus infection relies on early and accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, the signs and clinical symptoms of influenza virus infection are similar to those of infections with other bacterial respiratory pathogens. Consequently, clinicians rely on in vitro diagnostic methods to confirm influenza virus infection. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is not only important for managing the infection but also for minimizing the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics (Low, 2008, Lowe et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Several diagnostic methods are available to detect influenza viruses in patient specimens (Vemula et al., 2016). These include viral culture, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests, serological assays, rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs), and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Viral culture is laborious and time-consuming. Although DFA tests, RIDTs, and serology assays have shorter turnaround times (TATs), they lack the required sensitivity (Mahony et al., 2011). NAATs are rapidly replacing viral culture, DFA tests, RIDTs, and serology-based methods as the main method to diagnose influenza due to their improved sensitivity. However, most of these NAATs can only be performed at central laboratory centers due to their complexity and the requirement for sophisticated instrumentation. Isothermal-based NAATs can potentially shorten the amount of time required to diagnose influenza and avoid the need for complex instrumentation. Consequently, these assays could be potentially used for near-patient testing and in low-resource settings. An influenza diagnostic test must be able to detect and differentiate between influenza A and B viruses because antiviral drugs have different efficacies against these viruses (Allen et al., 2006). However, only a limited number of isothermal-based NAATs can be performed in a multiplex format in a single reaction tube due to the risk of non-specific amplification (Notomi et al., 2000, Piepenburg et al., 2006, Van Ness et al., 2003).",

Strand invasion-based amplification (SIBA) is an isothermal method that relies on a recombinase-coated single-stranded invasion oligonucleotide (IO) and a polymerase for the rapid and exponential amplification of nucleic acids (Hoser et al., 2014). SIBA is an attractive nucleic acid amplification method owing to its short TAT and high analytical sensitivity and specificity (Eboigbodin and Hoser, 2016, Eboigbodin et al., 2016a, Eboigbodin et al., 2016b, Eboigbodin et al., 2017). We took full advantage of these characteristics to develop a multiplex test that can detect and differentiate between influenza A and B viruses in a single reaction tube. Furthermore, the clinical performance of the multiplex RT-SIBA Influenza assay was compared with those of two established NAATs for the detection of influenza A and B viruses.",

While Gp32 prevents the formation of secondary structures in the single-stranded DNA (IO and primers), UvsX cooperatively binds to the single-stranded IO and displaces Gp32 to form an UvsX-IO filament complex. This complex catalyzes strand separation of the homologous target duplex, which enables primers to bind and extend the target via the action of a polymerase (Formosa and Alberts, 1986, Hoser et al., 2014, Liu and Morrical, 2010). The affinity of UvsX for a single-stranded DNA is dependent on the nucleotide composition, particularly the ratio of purines to pyrimidines (Formosa and Alberts, 1986). Because the influenza A and B assays were designed to detect different target sequences, we reasoned that their requirement for UvsX and Gp32 may differ. We sought to determine the optimal concentrations of UvsX and Gp32 to efficiently amplify both the influenza A and B virus targets in the same reaction tube.",

Fig. 1\nshows the amount of time taken to obtain a positive result with 200 copies of influenza A and B virus RNA per reaction. A positive result was obtained when the fluorescence signal of the probe exceeded the background signal. The amount of time taken to obtain a positive result for influenza A H1N1 decreased as the concentration of UvsX increased from 200 to 500 ng/ml, but increased as the concentration of Gp32 increased from 200 to 500 ng/ml. Similar findings were made with respect to the amount of time taken to obtain a positive result for influenza A H3N2. This is not surprising because the same primers and IO were used to detect these two strains. Variation of the UvsX concentration had less of an effect on the detection of influenza B virus. By contrast, an increase in the Gp32 concentration significantly decreased the amount of time taken to obtain a positive result for influenza B virus, opposite to its effect on the detection of influenza A virus. Influenza B virus was not detected in reactions containing 200 ng/ml Gp32 and 500 ng/ml UvsX. The difference in the amount of time taken to detect influenza A and B viruses could be due to a difference in the affinity of UvsX for DNA nucleotides. Based on these findings, subsequent experiments were performed using UvsX and Gp32 at final concentrations of 400 and 300 ng/ml, respectively.",

The sensitivity of the assay was determined in three independent experiments by adding serial dilutions of RNA extracted from viral particles with a CEID50 of 106 to one per reaction. Four replicates of each dilution were used and the results are shown in Fig. 2\n. The multiplex RT-SIBA Influenza assay reproducibly detected all influenza virus strains tested within 20 min using 10 CEID50 per reaction. When CEID50 was higher than 100 per reaction, it took as little as 7 min to obtain a positive result. These results demonstrate that the multiplex RT-SIBA Influenza assay is faster than most RT-PCR methods previously reported to detect influenza viruses. The limit of detections (LODs) at which influenza viruses were detected 95% of the time were further determined by Probit regression analysis. The LODs of the RT-SIBA Influenza assay for influenza A H1N1, influenza A H3N2, and influenza B viruses were 5, 1, and 9 CEID50 per reaction, respectively (Table 2\n), which correspond to 5, 10, and 19 RNA copies per reaction, respectively.",

Molecular methods, such as isothermal nucleic acid amplification, offer significant advantages such as relatively short TATs and simple setups. However, most isothermal amplification methods have mainly been used to detect a single target region, and there is limited evidence of their multiplexing capability (Notomi et al., 2000, Piepenburg et al., 2006, Van Ness et al., 2003). This has hampered the adoption of such methods in clinical settings, especially for the diagnosis of influenza, which requires the detection and differentiation of influenza A and B viruses. We previously reported an isothermal method to detect influenza A and B viruses in two different reaction chambers (Eboigbodin et al., 2016b). In the present study, we developed and evaluated an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method called RT-SIBA for the rapid detection and differentiation of influenza A and B viruses in a single reaction tube. This assay relies on a recombinase-coated oligonucleotide, a reverse transcription enzyme, and target-specific primers to exponentially amplify the target sequence of viral RNA (Eboigbodin and Hoser, 2016, Eboigbodin et al., 2017, Hoser et al., 2014).

Moreover, this assay detected 100 copies of influenza A H1N1, influenza A H3N2, and influenza B viral RNA within 15 min. This is significantly faster than most nucleic acid amplification methods, which take more than 1 h to detect such a low number of RNA copies. Furthermore, the RT-SIBA Influenza assay did not detect other common respiratory pathogens, suggesting that it is highly specific. The concentrations of UvsX and Gp32 proteins and the UvsX:Gp32 ratio can affect the sensitivity and speed of RT-SIBA, especially in the case of a multiplex assay. This was true for the multiplex RT-SIBA Influenza assay, in which the optimal concentrations of UvsX and Gp32 differed for the detection of influenza A virus versus influenza B virus. This is likely because the affinity of UvsX for an oligonucleotide is dependent on the length and nucleotide composition (Formosa and Alberts, 1986, Liu and Morrical, 2010). Although both UvsX and Gp32 are crucial for SIBA amplification, they also compete with themselves for binding to oligonucleotides (Formosa and Alberts, 1986, Hoser et al., 2014, Liu and Morrical, 2010). Therefore, the optimal concentrations of UvsX and Gp32 required for SIBA amplification may differ between target regions. Consequently, it is crucial to empirically determine the optimal concentrations of these proteins that allow multiple targets to be efficiently detected within the same reaction tube.",

            "text": "The analytical performance of the multiplex RT-SIBA Influenza assay was further elucidated by testing 132 retrospective NP swab and aspirate specimens that were previously determined to be positive or negative for influenza viruses. Moreover, the performance of this assay for the detection of influenza A and B viruses was compared with those of two established RT-PCR assays. The sensitivity of the RT-SIBA Influenza assay (98.8%) was significantly better than that of the CDC Influenza RT-PCR assay (89.3%), but slightly lower than that of the RealStar\u00ae Influenza RT-PCR assay (100%). The specificities of all three assays were 100%. Meanwhile, the sensitivities of the RT-SIBA Influenza assay for the detection of influenza A and B viruses were 100% and 97.5%, respectively. This slightly reduced sensitivity suggests that further optimization is required. Indeed, the assay was markedly improved by optimization of the Gp32 and UvsX concentrations. Nonetheless, the RT-SIBA Influenza assay displayed a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of influenza A and B viruses and its findings correlated well with those of the reference methods. Furthermore, the average amount of time taken to obtain a positive result was significantly shorter with the RT-SIBA Influenza assay (<20 min) than with the CDC and RealStar\u00ae Influenza RT-PCR assays (>90 min). Moreover, the RT-SIBA Influenza assay is performed at a low and constant temperature, and can therefore be run using battery-operated, portable devices with a small footprint. Thus, this assay has potential applications in both laboratory and near-patient settings.",
