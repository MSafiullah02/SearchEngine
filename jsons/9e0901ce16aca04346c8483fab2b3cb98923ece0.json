Experimental data that demonstrated that Zika virus was neurotropic have also been useful because they provided biologic plausibility for Zika virus's teratogenic effects: these findings were consistent with observations in congenitally infected infants. Challenges encountered with studies to evaluate the effects of these infections include the broad range of possible adverse outcomes, the inability to include all infected pregnant women in studies because many infections are asymptomatic, and the difficulty with interpretation of diagnostic testing of infants (WNV and Zika) and pregnant women (Zika).

Whether this is because few pregnant women were infected or because some WNV infections were missed is unknown; however, a significant proportion of WNV infections are asymptomatic (Pealer et al., 2003) , and other WNV infections might not have been recognized and appropriately tested.

Use of consistent methods of ascertainment and specific case definitions for microcephaly are necessary to improve surveillance quality (Cragan et al., 2016) .

These systems are planned to be complementary to the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry and ZAPSS; some infants will be identified by both systems, but infants who were not included in these systems, either because their mothers were not tested or for whom testing was misleading, will be identified by these birth defects surveillance systems if the infant has birth defects believed to be associated with congenital Zika infection (Gilboa et al. -this issue) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 241, "text": "(Gilboa et al.in this issue)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 586, "end": 607, "text": "(Cragan et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 746, "end": 767, "text": "(Cragan et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 988, "end": 1005, "text": "(Trevathan, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1683, "text": "(Gilboa et al. -this issue)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ZIKA VIRUS AND PREGNANCY"}, {"text": "Study designs that have been or are being used to examine Zika virus during pregnancy include case reports and case series, pregnancy registries, birth defects surveillance system data, case-control studies, and cohort analyses (Table  1) .
