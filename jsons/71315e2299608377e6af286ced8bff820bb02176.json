The exclusion criteria ruled out orthopaedic surgeons who assisted in fever clinics and designated COVID-19 wards in hospitals. To explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, we conducted a 1:2 ratio matched case-control study.

Hospitals without any infection cases among orthopaedic surgeons were not included in this current study. The incidence difference could be associated with the number of early admissions of patients with COVID-19, which was associated with the distance from the hospitals to the Huanan Seafood Market. For example, as the nearest hospital to the Huanan Seafood Market, the hospital designated as H4 in our study had the highest infection rate of 20.7% and was among the very first hospitals in Wuhan that admitted patients with COVID-19. The difference might also relate to the early awareness, alertness, and infection prevention and control measures taken by hospitals, but the answers regarding these hypotheses need more data at the hospital level. According to analyses of the questionnaire, the main suspected site of infection was general wards. This is in line with another report about health-care workers infected with COVID-19 6 . In the orthopaedic wards at that time, there were several cases in which patients were admitted for elective or trauma surgical procedures during their incubation period of COVID-19. During the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan, because of the serious shortage in virus test kits, testing for the pathogen could be performed only in suspected cases with symptoms that were severe or not self-limited. The real situation regarding how many patients in the orthopaedic wards had the comorbidity of COVID-19 was unknown. One surgeon consulted in the intensive care unit, where there was a patient with traumatic injury and fever of an unknown origin, which was later diagnosed as due to COVID-19. Three surgeons were exposed during operations on patients who were diagnosed as having COVID-19 several days after the surgical procedures. Thus, it is wise to minimize, postpone, or cancel elective operations during the pandemic. Family members of the patients and visitors also could be the source of virus in the wards. Public places at hospitals (e.g., elevators) could be contaminated and the virus could be transmitted from there by contact or droplet.",
