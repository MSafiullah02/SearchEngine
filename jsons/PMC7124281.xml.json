IAV belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and is a single stranded negative sense RNA virus with eight RNA segments encoding at least 11 proteins. Hemagglutinin (HA), encoded by the fourth RNA segment, is the major membrane glycoprotein that mediates viral attachment and fusion and determines pathogenicity and virulence. Neuraminidase (NA), encoded by the sixth RNA fragment, is the second major membrane glycoprotein. Both HA and NA are crucial antigenic components of the virus. Due to immune selection pressures, low fidelity of RNA transcription, and RNA reassortment of the viral genome, a variety of genetic and immunogenic HA and NA variants emerge constantly. Up to now, 18 HA and 9 NA subtypes of type A influenza virus have been identified (Tong et al., 2013).",

            "text": "In the 21st century, the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus emerged in 2009 from Mexico and quickly spread all over the world (WHO, 2012). In the first year of infection alone, H1N1 caused 151,700\u2013575,400 deaths, and there were an estimated 60 million cases of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain and a number of severe cases in young adults without underlying disease (cdc.gov). People at higher risk of serious complications include the elderly (>65 years), younger children (<5), and pregnant women. In severe cases, symptoms included pneumonia, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia and death (Desdouits et al., 2013, Guedj et al., 2012, Mammas et al., 2011). Vaccination is the best preventive strategy against influenza. The safety and efficacy of the vaccine for the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain was evaluated (Liang et al., 2010), and the adverse events associated with 2009 H1N1 vaccination raised concerns that affected the large-scale administration of the influenza vaccine (CDC, 2009, Williams et al., 2011, Choe et al., 2011). Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome was one of the several adverse events observed after vaccination with the 2009 H1N1 vaccine (Deeks et al., 2011, Greenberg et al., 2009). However, the pathological mechanisms underlying influenza A virus infection and vaccine-induced serious adverse reactions are still poorly understood. Monsalvo et al. (2011) found non-protective antibodies in the sera from patients with severe pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza disease, and these non-protective-antibodies were found to be associated with immune complexes. We hypothesized that autoimmunity plays a role in the development of severe symptoms after virus infection and vaccination-related adverse events (Ahmed et al., 2014, Perdan-Pirkmajer et al., 2012). However, more evidence is required in support of this hypothesis.",

The anti-streptococcal antibodies produced upon hemolytic streptococci infection bind to the glomerular basement membrane causing glomerulonephritis (Kraus and Beachey, 1998). Moreover, antigens shared by Escherichia coli O14 type lipopolysaccharide and human colonic mucosa have been related to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis caused by E. coli O14 (Laercrantz et al., 1968). Anti-autoantibodies have also been identified in lung tissue from patients with atypical pneumonia infected with coronavirus (Li et al., 2005).",

When the fused cells proliferated and settled at the bottom of the wells, 10\u201350% positive antibody-secreting cells were screened via indirect ELISA using the H1N1 HA protein.

A panel of 84 clones of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were successfully generated using the HA proteins from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine lysate and the seasonal influenza A1 vaccines. Among the 84 clones of mAbs obtained, 38 (H1N1) were made from the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine (for example, H1N1 A/South Carolina/1918 (A/SC/1918)), 46 from seasonal influenza A1 vaccine (add information same as before).

These results suggested that antigenic mimics or heterophilic antigenic epitopes are shared between influenza virus HA protein and human tissues (brain and pancreas). Because such heterophilic antigenic epitopes are capable of inducing autoimmunity in the host, they may be involved in the pathological mechanisms underlying 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection and vaccine-triggered adverse events. Based on previous studies on some heterophilic antigenic epitopes shared by pathogenic microorganisms and human tissue (Kraus and Beachey, 1998, Laercrantz et al., 1968), we proposed that autoimmunity induced by the influenza HA protein might play a role in the pathogenesis associated with influenza virus infection and vaccination. Carlo Garzelli et al. found that the monoclonal antibody secreted by Epstein\u2013Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes could react with multiple organs including the thyroid, pancreas, stomach, muscles and nerves, indicating that Epstein\u2013Barr virus can induce autoantibodies (Naundorf et al., 2002). Srinivasappa et al. (1968) reported that 600 mAb clones prepared using 11 viral antigens were able to react with 14 different organs from normal uninfected mice. Approximately 3.5% of these mAbs (21/600) reacted with specific types of cells from these organs. Therefore, viral infections might stimulate autoimmune reactions.",

Two of the 84 mAbs generated in our study were capable of binding to human brain tissue. These two clones may be useful tools to further understand whether the development of Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome is related to influenza vaccination or not. In addition, 2 more clones were found to react with human islet \u03b1 cells (data to be published). Our study suggests that autoimmunity might be induced by influenza infection and vaccination.
