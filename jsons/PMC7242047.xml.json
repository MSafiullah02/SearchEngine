There are three problems related to SDVs from the safety engineering perspective. The challenge in ensuring safety in the SDV starts from (1) the complexity of the autonomous system, (2) the interactions between autonomous functions and the human driver, and (3) the ambiguous safety constraints. Firstly, the complexity of SDVs system is determined by the automation level and its autonomous functions. According to SAE International [3], the levels of autonomy are classified from 0\u20135. The automation levels 1 to 4 (semi-automation) involve a human driver within the driving tasks, while automation level 5 (full automation) does not engage a human driver within the driving tasks. Secondly, based on the level of autonomy, the human driver and autonomous system may work together to perform driving tasks. Therefore, ensuring a secure transition of vehicle control between a human driver and the autonomous system is an important aspect. Thirdly, due to the variety of scenarios and faults that might occur in the SDV system, gathering the safety constraints to ensure the functionality of the autonomous system is a challenging task.",

The first objective is to reconsider and analyse the taxonomy requirements [3] in order to identify the safety requirements for the autonomous functions of SDVs on different levels of automation. The second objective focuses on the interaction among different components of an SDV at the system level in order to find the potential relationships among these components, especially when a human driver component and autonomous controller component frequently take control of the vehicle.

At the high level, the concept of a rational agent is used to focus on the autonomous controller, who is responsible for making decisions, and simplify the complexity of SDV system. A rational agent is a software that can perceive its environment via sensors and can explain its intentions [4]. The set of rules can be defined and formally verified into a rational agent entity [4]. In order to use the concept of the rational agent, the logical requirements (rules) must be defined. Consequently, formal methods such as LTL (linear temporal logic) can be used to verify the rational agent software.",

            "text": "There are some work in the literature that address the low-level issues of the SDV. The implementation of an SDV mainly relies on machine learning (ML) and its deep neural network (DNN). Although ML algorithms would perform with high accuracy in the image classification task, the work of ML might be affected by the input perturbations of image and lead to an incorrect classification. The input perturbations can be anything such as a \u2018shadow\u2019 and \u2018weather\u2019 which can affect the functionality of the SDV. This kind of manipulation is known as \u2018adversarial perturbations\u2019 [5]. Therefore, Huang et al. [5] proposed an automated verification framework for proving the adversarial robustness of the DNN. This approach is based on applying constraints through the layers of the DNN in order to prevent any misclassifications that might be caused by the adversarial examples. These constraints bound the regions of inputs for all points that are related to the same classification result. Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) is used to develop this verification framework. However, in order to apply this type of approach, the diameter of each region that belongs to a specific classification result must be known, and also the potential adversarial examples must be identified as well.",

The guidelines mentioned in the cookbook suggest that the phenomenon of a system can be divided into two categories: 1) variables that identify between environment and controller, 2) variables that represent the interaction between human operators and the environment. There were two contributions related to this approach for modelling the functionality of the autonomous controller: a cruise control system, and lane departure warning system (LDWS) [7]. These autonomous functions belong to a lower level of automation (Level-1). However, reconsidering the ideas that were mentioned in [6, 7] might help in either analysing the features of taxonomy requirements or modelling forward to the next automation level.",

The concept of fail-safe mechanisms focuses on the functional requirements and is part of the system requirements. The policing function can check output values of autonomous functions such as an ML model at runtime. The important step of using a validation technique such as a policing function is to demonstrate the safety constraints for the autonomous functions, and are used either to validate the result of autonomous functions or detect failures in the runtime. According to Hoang et al.

In order to achieve that, there are three layers that would be used to simplify the complexity of the SDV system as follows: the specification of the features layer, the decision mechanism layer, and the actuation layer. The aim of specification layer is to specify features that would be considered for making a driving decision by modifying the vehicle control variables at the actuation layer. Due to the driving decision might be made by the human-driver or autonomous controller, the local and global features are introduced. The local features focus on the autonomous functions and its safety constraints, while the global features consider the entire system and try to hold features that might be used when an autonomous function can not perform a driving task.",
