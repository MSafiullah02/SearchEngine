In this Comment, we used both preprint and peer-reviewed studies that estimated the transmissibility potential (ie, basic reproduction number [R\n0]) of SARS-CoV-2 on or before Feb 1, 2020 to investigate the role that preprints have had in information dissemination during the ongoing outbreak. We also analysed the agreement of preprint estimates compared with those presented by peer-reviewed studies and propose a consensus-based approach for evaluating the validity of preprint findings during public health crises. For our analysis, we collected publicly available data from scientific studies, news reports, and search trends pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 and its R\n0. Defined as the average number of secondary infections that a new case might transmit in a fully susceptible population, estimates of R\n0 can provide decision makers with insights into the epidemic potential of a given outbreak.",

In the event of multiple R\n0 estimates\u2014because of preprint revisions after the first version or the use of multiple approaches in a single study\u2014each estimate was recorded and treated as a separate entry to represent all available knowledge at any given point in time (appendix p 3). Given that the first known preprint estimates for R\n0 were posted to SSRN by us on Jan 23, we plotted search trend fractions and news report volume between Jan 23 and Feb 1 (appendix p 4). Baseline data for both sources before Jan 23, 2020, yielded negligible search trend interest and news report volume, and data collected up to Feb 9, 2020, showed diminishing interest and volume after the catchment window (appendix p 4). To illustrate when each of the 11 relevant studies became available to the public, indicator bars were overlaid against the search trend and news report data by date of publication (appendix p 4). We then plotted each of the 16 R\n0 estimates produced by the 11 studies, including both the mean and the estimate range (eg, 95% CI, 95% credible interval, and so on) presented (appendix p 3). Estimates were plotted by date of publication and alphabetically there-in, offering a side-by-side comparison of preprint versus peer-reviewed results; averages and 95% CIs were also computed for both groups (figure\n).",

In the selected time frame, search interest peaked on Jan 27 after a sharp increase between Jan 23 and Jan 25 immediately after the publication of five early preprint studies\u2014all of which estimated R\n0\u2014in bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN. Meanwhile, news media interest peaked on Jan 28, coinciding with a sixth preprint study published in arXiv (appendix p 4). The first peer-reviewed estimates were then published by Li and colleagues in The New England Journal of Medicine on Jan 29 at 17:00 h (eastern standard time), followed by four additional peer-reviewed studies in Eurosurveillance, The International Journal of Infectious Diseases, The Lancet, and Journal of Clinical Medicine up to Feb 1.14, 19 Average R\n0 estimates across the preprint group were 3\u00b761 (95% CI 2\u00b777\u20134\u00b745) and 2\u00b754 (2\u00b717\u20132\u00b791) across the peer-reviewed group\u2014showing overlap in 95% CIs despite a wide diversity of modelling methods and data sources used both in-group and across-group (appendix p 3). Although the average mean for the preprint group was higher than that for the peer-reviewed group, this effect was driven primarily by two upper-limit outlier estimates (with R\n0 higher than the 95% CI maximum; figure).9, 10 Exclusion of these two estimates by use of a consensus-based approach based on the 95% CIs yielded an average R\n0 estimate of 3\u00b702 (95% CI 2\u00b765\u20133\u00b739) for the preprint group. Notably, two studies in the peer-reviewed group had previously been published as preprints.15, 16 Although estimates presented by Riou and Althaus remained unchanged after peer review, estimates presented by Zhao and colleagues were higher before peer review than afterwards.",

Here, we used a simple method in which we plotted the ten R\n0 estimates that were posted as preprints before publication of the first peer-reviewed study on Jan 29; we then took the average of these estimates and excluded the two estimates that qualified as upper-limit outliers\u2014both upon visual inspection and as a function of the 95% CI. Even before outlier elimination, this simple method yielded average R\n0 estimates similar to those presented by the peer-reviewed studies subsequently published on and after Jan 29; however, more complex approaches that incorporate weighted averages based on estimate confidence, similar to traditional meta-analytical methods, offer a promising avenue for future work. Such collective, consensus-based approaches will arguably be easiest to use when the research of interest is quantitative in nature; nevertheless, given that many crucial epidemiological parameters that inform decision making (eg, incubation period, generation time, and so on) are quantitative, our proposed approach could work well in these contexts as well.",

Furthermore, given that two of the preprints included in this analysis were later published in peer-reviewed outlets, the evidence shows that that even prestigious journals now permit the sharing of important findings before peer review and that the use of preprint platforms does not jeopardise future peer-reviewed publication.15, 16 Without question, primacy and peer-reviewed publications are key metrics in individual professional advancement (eg, academic promotion); nevertheless, the impact of preprints on discourse and decision making pertaining to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak suggests that we must rethink how we reward and recognise community contributions during present and future public health crises.",

If a first author published more than one relevant independent study before Feb 1, the version number is followed immediately by an alphabetical marker ordered by date of publication (nx).
