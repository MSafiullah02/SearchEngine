These observations suggest the presence of underlying genetic predispositions to the development of ALI. Two different approaches, namely, candidate gene and genome-wide analysis, may provide new insight. Leikauf and colleagues, studying gene-environment interactions in inbred mouse strains, examined the relative susceptibility to ALI induced by a variety of environmental agents.6,\n7 These investigators found a varied response among different strains and concluded that susceptibility to ALI is heritable. Using complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis to identify clusters of coregulated genes, they found altered expression of relatively few genes that control the complex responses of lung injury and repair. These findings suggest candidate genes that may contribute to individual susceptibility to the development of ARDS.",

Alveolar overdistention coupled with the repeated collapse and reopening of alveoli has also been shown to initiate a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines.34 Additional mechanisms by which repetitive opening and closing of lung units may result in damage to alveolar cells may include activation of complex intracellular signaling pathways, stimulation of paracrine stimulation of pathways, and disruption of alveolar cell plasma membranes.35 However, the concept of repetitive opening and closing of distal lung units has been called into question, and the alternative concept of the filling of dependent lung regions with edema fluid and foam has been proposed.36 The mechanisms associated with development of VILI are reviewed in depth in Chapter 5.",

In 1984, Robertson proposed that repeated opening and closing of lung units during tidal breathing of infants with respiratory distress syndrome could result in lung injury.37 Robertson suggested that in an atelectatic lung, the air-liquid interface may be found proximally in the terminal conducting airways, rather than in the alveoli. Opening of these airways would require relatively higher forces, and the shear stresses produced could cause epithelial disruption. Other investigators have shown evidence for lung injury from low lung volume ventilation using various species, lung injury models, PEEP strategies, and modes of ventilation.38, 39, 40, 41, 42\n",

A National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) trial showed that the use of a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg ideal body weight resulted in a 22% decrease in mortality compared with ventilation with 12 mL/kg ideal body weight in patients with ALI/ARDS.43 The excess mortality associated with large tidal volume ventilation may be related to cytokine response and the development of multisystem organ failure.34,\n44,\n45 Ranieri and colleagues found that both the pulmonary and the systemic cytokine responses were reduced in patients with ARDS who were treated with low tidal volume ventilation.44\n",

The importance of endothelial injury leading to increased vascular permeability and formation of pulmonary edema is well established, and a critical role of epithelial injury in ALI/ARDS has also been recognized.47 The alveolar epithelium is composed of type I and type II cells, occupying 90% and 10% of the alveolar surface area, respectively.

Activated neutrophils produce a variety of inflammatory mediators, including reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide (NO), leukotrienes, cytokines, chemokines, proteases, platelet-activating factor, and cationic proteins. Other cells, including pulmonary macrophages and alveolar endothelial and epithelial cells, also produce inflammatory mediators. Alveolar macrophages are able to secrete cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Apart from these proinflammatory mediators, a host of endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators can simultaneously be present, including IL-1 receptor antagonist, soluble TNF receptor, autoantibodies against IL-8, and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-11.54 In fact, imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators may play an important role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. The end result of this vicious cycle is alveoli filled with protein-rich edema fluid, cells, cellular debris, red blood cells, and fibrin-rich hyaline membranes on the denuded basement membrane.",

In the next 36 hours, with greater exudation of fluid in alveolar spaces, a characteristic bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrate may progress to ground-glass opacification and frank consolidation, as illustrated in Figure 4.1A\n.69 As shown in Figure 4.2\n, the patient may also develop pleural effusions, and their presence should not sway the physician from making the diagnosis of ARDS. This progression is typical but not pathognomonic of ARDS. Radiographic findings may resolve rapidly in patients with near drowning, opiate-related ALI/ARDS, or uncomplicated viral pneumonia. However, in most cases, the radiographic findings resolve over weeks. During this time, the development of new focal areas of air space opacities may indicate the development of nosocomial pneumonia.70 In addition, ARDS may be complicated by pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum secondary to the disease itself or as a complication of mechanical ventilation. With the complete resolution of the disease, the chest radiograph may either revert to normal or reveal coarse reticular opacities, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, and cysts, likely as a consequence of the effects of both lung repair and barotrauma.71, 72, 73, 74 The radiographic criterion of bilateral diffuse infiltrates in the AECC definition of ALI/ARDS shows high interobserver variability when applied by investigators expert in the fields of mechanical ventilation and ARDS.4\n",

The most striking CT finding in the early phase of disease is the heterogeneous nature of detectable lung injury (see Figs. 4.1 and 4.2). Three areas of lung are easily recognized: (1) normal or almost normal lung regions, most frequently located in nondependent lung; (2) ground-glass opacification, defined as a hazy increase in lung attenuation, with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, in the midlung area; and (3) consolidation in the most dependent lung.75,\n76 During the late or fibroproliferative phase of the disease, fluid is reabsorbed, leading to a decrease in CT density of the lung. There is also an increase in subpleural cysts or bullae.77 In patients who survive ALI/ARDS, a reticular pattern is described in the nondependent normal lung regions; this pattern has been correlated with the length of mechanical ventilation and the use of inverse ratio ventilation.78\n",

Thus, the respiratory compliance in early ALI/ARDS appears to be a direct measure of normally aerated tissue, a finding suggesting that in ALI/ARDS the aerated lung is not stiff, but rather small.81 The value of the information gained from CT scans must be balanced against the potential risk of transporting critically ill patients, the additional costs, and the additional radiation dose. Therefore, CT scanning of the lungs of patients with ALI/ARDS is most clearly indicated for solving clinical dilemmas, such as detecting occult complications in patients who are deteriorating or not improving at the expected rate, or for formal research protocols.",

These investigators proposed that this difference in respiratory mechanics and response to PEEP is consistent with a prevalence of consolidation in pulmonary ARDS, as opposed to the presence of predominantly edema and alveolar collapse in extrapulmonary ARDS.

For example, in a survey of ventilation practices, critical care physicians reported using a broad range of tidal volumes (5 to 17 mL/kg) in patients with ALI.85 In the 1990s, several clinical trials were conducted to guide clinicians in the choice of tidal volumes.43,\n86, 87, 88, 89 Amato and colleagues evaluated the effects of a lung protective ventilation strategy on pulmonary complications and mortality at 28 days in patients with ARDS.86 Patients were randomized to either a conventional study group or a lung protective ventilation group. Patients in the conventional group received tidal volumes of approximately 12 mL/kg of body weight and a mean PEEP of approximately 8 cm H2O during the first 7 days of treatment, whereas those in the lung protective strategy group received tidal volumes of approximately 6 mL/kg and a mean PEEP level of 16.4 cm H2O during the first 36 hours of treatment. The tidal volumes in this latter group were further decreased if inspiratory airway pressures exceeded 40 cm H2O. The results showed that patient survival, frequency of barotrauma, and rate of weaning from mechanical ventilation were all improved in the group receiving lower tidal volumes and higher PEEP. In this small study, it was unclear whether the improvement in outcome was attributable to the lower tidal volumes, the inspiratory pressure limits, or the higher PEEP. There have been four subsequent randomized clinical trials to investigate the role of different tidal volume ventilation strategies in patients with ALI or at risk of developing ALI.43,\n87, 88, 89 In three of these trials, the volume- and pressure-limited approach was not associated with improved clinical outcome.87, 88, 89 However, a trial43 by the NHLBI's Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network (ARDS Network) was stopped after enrollment of 861 patients because the mortality was significantly lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31% versus 39.8%). Further, the lower tidal volume group had more ventilator-free and end-organ failure\u2013free days during the first 28 days and a greater reduction in plasma IL-6 levels compared with patients treated with larger tidal volumes and higher pressures. Results of the ARDS Network ALVEOLI study showed no survival benefit when a low tidal volume ventilation strategy was used in conjunction with a higher, as opposed to lower, PEEP value.90\n",

Frequent small breaths augment diffusive exchange of respiratory gases. Use of HFOV theoretically avoids the high peak airway pressure common with conventional ventilation, prevents alveolar overdistention, and maintains a higher peak end-expiratory pressure, thus possibly avoiding lung injury resulting from repetitive recruitment and derecruitment of alveoli. Derdak and associates reported on a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of oscillatory ventilation for ARDS.96 Although this trial was not powered to evaluate mortality differences, a trend toward overall improved mortality was observed in the HFOV-treated group (37%) versus the group treated with conventional mechanical ventilation (52%). However, the group treated with conventional mechanical ventilation was not ventilated with a lung protective ventilation approach, because the tidal volumes in this group were approximately 10 mL/kg.",

Levels of critical components of the antioxidant defense system are induced during exposure to modest levels of inspired oxygen, and thus the patient who requires high levels of inspired oxygen may be at somewhat less risk of lung injury than the patient with a sudden requirement for sustained high levels of inspired oxygen. Thus, a high Fio\n2 may be used for brief periods as a temporizing measure; however, it is recommended that aggressive steps be taken to reduce the Fio\n2 whenever it exceeds 0.65.

Glucocorticoid treatment in ARDS/ALI is controversial. Short courses of high-dose glucocorticoids were shown to be ineffective, and possibly harmful, in clinical trials of ARDS prevention in patients with severe sepsis and in patients with established ARDS.108, 109, 110, 111 A small randomized placebo-controlled trial suggested a beneficial effect of prolonged use of glucocorticoids in late ARDS.112 However, the NIH ARDS Network conducted a larger study of methylprednisolone for patients with ARDS of 7 to 28 days' duration that suggests no outcome benefit.113 Though use of glucocorticoids improved the cardiopulmonary physiology and increased the number of ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, and shock-free days during the first 28 days, it failed to reduce hospital stay or improve the in-hospital mortality and was associated with an increased incidence of neuromyopathy. In fact, initiation of glucocorticoids two or more weeks after the onset of ARDS was associated with an increased mortality rate when compared with the placebo group.

In adults with ARDS, two randomized controlled trials failed to show an advantage of ECMO over conventional ventilation.128,\n129 However, both these trials were performed before the development of modern heparinized tubings and membrane oxygenators, which may reduce the complications of this modality.",

Reasons for the decline in ARDS-associated mortality are varied. In a 9-year retrospective review of surgical and trauma patients, Rocco and colleagues found, predominantly in trauma patients, a declining death rate from ARDS largely resulting from the use of lung protective ventilation strategies.137 The predictors of death in this study at the onset of ARDS were advanced age, a Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score of 8 or more, and a Lung Injury Score of 2.76 or more. In a similar study, the decrease in mortality of patients with ARDS was attributed mostly to a decreased incidence of nonpulmonary organ failure.138 Consistent with this view, Page and associates found that, for patients with ARDS who were managed with a lung protective ventilation strategy, the strongest predictor of death was not the degree of pulmonary failure, but rather the presence and severity of circulatory failure.139 The dominant influence on mortality of comorbidities was noted by Estenssoro and associates, who prospectively studied all patients who developed ARDS in four ICUs for 1 year.140 Hospital mortality was reported to be 58%, and the main causes of mortality were multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock. In this study, independent predictors of death included organ dysfunction and Pao\n2/Fio\n2. A decrease in pulmonary dead space fraction has also been identified as a separate risk factor.141 The influence of comorbidities was also observed by Davidson and colleagues, who, in a prospective cohort study of 127 patients with ARDS associated with trauma or sepsis, found no difference in the long-term mortality rate for the patients with ARDS compared with 127 control subjects matched for age, risk factors for ARDS, comorbidity, and severity of illness.142\n",
