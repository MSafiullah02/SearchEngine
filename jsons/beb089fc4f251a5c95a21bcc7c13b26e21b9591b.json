SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. The viral RNA encodes non structural protein Nsp13 or the viral helicase protein that helps the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to execute RNA replication by unwinding the RNA duplexes. In this study we identified a novel mutation at position 541of the helicase where the tyrosine (Y) got substituted with cytosine (C). We found that Y541C is a destabilizing mutation increasing the molecular flexibility and leading to decreased affinity of helicase binding with RNA. Earlier we had reported a mutation P504L in the helicase protein for which had not performed RNA binding study. Here we report that P504L mutation leads to increased affinity of helicase RNA interaction. So, both these mutations have opposite effects on RNA binding. Moreover, we found a significant fraction of isolate population where both P504L and Y541C mutations were coexisting.",

The structural proteins participate in forming the structure of the virus particle whereas the non-structural proteins play crucial roles in various steps of the virus life cycle after entry into the host cells. After the virus enters the host cell, the virus undergoes uncoating and the viral genetic material is released in the host cell cytoplasm where the viral positive sense RNA undergoes translation to form the various viral proteins. The viral proteins are formed in the form of polyprotein that gets processed by host cell proteases and viral protease. Followed by synthesis of viral non-structural proteins the viral RNA undergoes replication. Replication is important as this gives rise to new viral RNA strands that get later packaged into progeny virus particles. The viral RNA replication is primarily aided by two proteins, the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral helicase.",

Thus, helicase compliments the function of RdRp. Here, we studied 1549 sequences corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 RNA helicase from different geographical locations. Sequence alignments and comparison with reference sequence form China revealed two amino acid positions that were mutated in more than 400 samples in case of each type. These mutations accounted to nearly 27-30% of the total sequences analysed ( Figure 1 ) although this number might further change with more sequences been checked. Both these mutations were found to co-exist in 409 sequences of the North American isolates. At position 504 of the helicase, proline (P) was replaced by Leucine (L) (mutation P504L) and at 541 position, tyrosine (Y) got mutated to Cysteine (C) (mutation Y541C). In our earlier study we had reported mutation at position 504 but had not characterized the same in depth with respect to location of mutation and effect on RNA binding [5] . To check the location of these mutations on the helicase protein, we subjected the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 sequence to motif scan ( Figure 1C, D) . We found that the mutation P504L was located at the second AAA domain (between residues 486 to 575). AAA family of domains have conserved modules which bring together active site elements of adjacent subunits for ATP hydrolysis [6] . This is required for generation of mechanical force for translocation of substrate which in case of SARS-CoV2 helicase should be the RNA duplex that needs to unwind for the replication to initiate or progress. Thus, a mutation in this domain could have modulatory function on RNA replication by possibly modulating either the efficiency of ATP hydrolysis or the dynamics/speed of RNA unwinding. In a report by Wei et al, it was shown that a P to L mutation in the ATPase p97 showed enhanced ATPase activity [6] and desensitized this protein against its inhibitors. In another study by Lin et al it was demonstrated that a mutation from P to L in the reverse transcriptase domain of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) increased replication competency of the enzyme [8] . Although in our study the location of mutation and the enzyme are different than those of cited studies, it supports the likelihood that P504L mutation might lead to better helicase activity and thus might in turn enhance or expedite RdRp activity by better RNA unwinding and translocation processes.",

We selected the model/s based on maximum sequence similarity with the available template ( Figure 2 ). These homology models could be used for detailed structure analyses, molecular docking studies and also target search in future by us as well as by others. Hence, these models will be deposited in public database for use. Here, we visualized the mutations in the context of full-length protein in 3D format using these structures. The mutations appeared to locally change the conformation of the helicase domain. Thus, we looked for alterations in the secondary structure of the protein using Chou and Fasman secondary structure prediction tool ( Figure 3 ).

To correlate the structural modulation by these mutations with the function, we ran RNA binding analyses using mCSM NA server (Figure 4) . RNA binding studies revealed that the replacement of tyrosine with cysteine decreased the affinity of the helicase protein for RNA template. Normal mode analysis/ protein dynamics study supported the mCSM data that the protein stability decreased and there was increase in protein flexibility for Y541C mutation ( Figure 5 ).

Our analyses indicated possible role of at least one of these mutations in enhancing affinity of helicase RNA interaction and thus replication. To further validate this model, these mutations could be incorporated in helicase protein and assayed for effect on RNA unwinding activity. Further, careful epidemiological surveillance and sequence analyses from more isolates would help understand the significance of these variants or lineages in evolution and spread of this virus. Such variants if found more virulent in nature could be specifically targeted focussing on the mutant helicase to design therapeutic candidates.",
