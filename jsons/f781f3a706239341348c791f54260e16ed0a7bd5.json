Both methods detected influenza viruses A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B, human parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) types A and B, and human adenoviruses. In addition, human coronavirus (hCoV) groups I (229E-like) and II (OC43-like), as well as the new human metapneumovirus (hMPV), types A and B, were searched for by RT-PCR alone. When results obtained by both methods were added, the overall percentage of patients positive for at least one respiratory virus peaked at 44.2%, involving 92/208 patients (81 pediatric, and 11 adults), while 116 patients (55.8%) were negative for any respiratory virus tested. The most common circulating virus was hRSV, infecting 54 (25.9%) patients (24 type A, and 30 type B strains), followed by hMPV, infecting 12 (5.8%) patients (7 type A and 5 type B strains). Coinfections by two respiratory viruses interested 11 (5.3%) patients, and 9 (81.8%) of these were infected by hRSV in association with another respiratory virus. In the great majority of infected children, hRSV and hMPV were associated with lower respiratory tract infections. In lung transplant recipients, viruses present in bronchoalveolar lavage appeared to be associated frequently with lower respiratory tract infections. In conclusion: the combination of immunological and molecular assays is the most sensitive approach to the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections; and infections caused by the less investigated hCoVs and hMPVs represent a fair proportion of respiratory infections.",

            "text": "Until three decades ago, the diagnosis of respiratory virus infection required virus isolation and identification in embryonated hens eggs or in cell cultures, and this procedure was cumbersome and time-consuming. At that time, rapid diagnosis of respiratory virus infections in cells from respiratory tract started by using immunofluorescence and cross-absorbed animal immune sera [Gardner and Mc Quillin, 1974] . In the 1990s, monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for the different conventional respiratory viruses became available, thus rendering rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract infections in nasopharyngeal aspirates more reliable [Stout et al., 1989; Navarro-Mari et al., 1999; Fong et al., 2000] . In parallel, new cell culture systems with increased susceptibilities to respiratory viruses were identified, in addition to primary monkey kidney cell cultures. Thus, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were found to be highly susceptible to influenza viruses A and B, LLC-MK2 to human parainfluenza viruses [Frank et al., 1979; Shih et al., 1999] , human lung carcinoma cells (A549) to human adenoviruses [Woods and Young, 1988; Smith et al., 1991] , and mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells to several influenza viruses A and B as well as other respiratory viruses [Huang and Turchek, 2000] . Thus, at the moment, fluorescent MAbs and appropriate cell culture systems, including mixed Mv1Lu and A549 cell cultures [Huang and Turchek, 2000] , are widely used for optimal detection of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions [Percivalle et al., 1989; Navarro-Mari et al., 1999; Shih et al., 1999; Zavattoni et al., 2003] .",

Of the 73 adult patients (median age 51, range 16-81 years), 19 were lung transplant recipients (median age 45, range 24-65 years), from whom 15 bronchoalveolar lavage and 14 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were taken during follow-up. Upon specimen reception and following homogenization, each respiratory sample was divided into four aliquots: one was used immediately for direct fluorescent antibody staining of respiratory cells present in respiratory secretions; the second was also used imme-diately and inoculated onto cell cultures for virus isolation; the third was frozen immediately and then used retrospectively for molecular assays; and the fourth was subaliquoted and stored frozen as a back-up sample for future testing or studies. All samples were examined by two diagnostic approaches: immunological and molecular. The immunological approach was adopted prospectively and based on use of MAb for virus identification in both respiratory secretion cells and inoculated cell cultures. The molecular approach was adopted retrospectively and was based on use of RT-PCR, which was performed directly on nucleic acids extracted from respiratory samples. Following reverse transcription, cDNA was used for all RT-PCR assays as well as repeat testing. Viruses sought for by both methods were influenza viruses A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B, human parainfluenza viruses types 1 to 3 (hPIV 1-3), human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), and human adenoviruses (hAdVs). In addition, hCoV, groups I (229E-like) and II (OC43-like), as well as hMPV, types A and B, were sought by RT-PCR only. The hCoVs were grouped by sequencing and hMPVs were typed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.",

The MAbP used in the study (SimulFluor Respiratory Screen, Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) contains two components. One component is a pool of fluorescein-conjugated MAbs staining bright apple-green influenza viruses A and B, hPIV 1-3-, hRSV-, and hAdV-infected cells without differentiating among these viruses. The other component is a rhodamine-conjugated MAb directed against hRSV and staining yellow-gold hRSV-infected cells, thereby differentiating hRSV from the other respiratory viruses. The fluorescein-conjugated MAbs to individual respiratory viruses were obtained from the same commercial source (Chemicon). MAb to hCoV OC43 (Chemicon) was preliminarily found to perform satisfactorily for virus identification of the reference strain as well as cells from respiratory secretions positive by RT-PCR, whereas MAb to hCoV 229E was not able to identify the relevant prototype virus.

Primers were either selected from published protocols or originally designed from GenBank published virus sequences. Reference strains were propagated in cell cultures and virus RNA or DNA was extracted by using the NucliSens 1 Isolation Reagents procedure (BioM\u00e9rieux, Boxtel, NL) for the simultaneous recovery of both nucleic acids, which were submitted to RT-PCR. Amplification products were then cloned in PCR2.1 plasmid vector (TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to achieve quantitative standards for the determination of the analytical sensitivity of each RT-PCR assay. In initial experiments, carried out according to amplification protocols reported in the literature, a wide variability in the analytical sensitivity of individual amplification assays was observed (range 10 0 -10 5 input copies). Therefore, all RT-PCR reactions were optimized to detect at least 10 input plasmid copies. To this purpose, while the reported thermal profiles or reaction mixtures had to be modified for some viruses, new sets of primers were needed for other viruses ( Table I ). The RT reaction was performed in a final volume of 120 ml, using 12 ml of extracted nucleic acids, 600 pmol of random examer primers (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and 240 U of SuperScript TM II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 ml using 10 ml cDNA (containing 1 ml extracted DNA for hAdVs amplification), 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 (for hRSV, hAdV, hMPV, and hCoV), 2.0 mM MgCl 2 (for influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, and influenza B), and 3.0 mM MgCl 2 (for hPIV-1, hPIV-2, and hPIV-3), 0.001% gelatin, 250 mM dNTP, 25 pmol each primer and 1.5 U of Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).

            "text": "A major objective of this study was to investigate whether, in a diagnostic virology laboratory, the molecular approach to the diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections in a patient population admitted to hospital was more convenient than the immunological approach. Both strategies may provide clinicians with most results of viral assays the same day of sample collection. However, the immunologic approach is not based only on direct staining of cells from nasopharyngeal secretions (thus providing results within a few hours after specimen collection), but also on virus isolation in both short-term and long-term cell cultures, followed by virus identification with MAbs. Thus, in this case, although the majority of infected patients may be detected by direct staining, a fair aliquot of acute respiratory infections may only be diagnosed following cell cultures, i.e., at later times. In addition, reading of directly stained slides requires expertise in immunofluorescence and dedicated personnel for interpretation of results, while handling and testing of a large number of samples is not feasible. In addition, nasopharyngeal samples may not be adequate and, according to our protocol, influenza viruses could not be subtyped, hPIVs were not typed, and, finally, both hCoVs 229E and hMPVs could not be detected. RT-PCR may be better standardized and allows direct typing of respiratory viruses. Obviously, the PCR performance bears the risk of carry-over contamination, which must be prevented by adopting strict containment measures (separate rooms, disposable tips, adequately educated personnel). In addition, multiple negative and positive PCR controls were included in each test run. Recently, several multiplex PCR and RT-PCR systems have been developed, which have been claimed to have the same, and even a greater, sensitivity than conventional viral culture or antigen detection methods [Gilbert et al., 1996; Ellis et al., 1997; Freymuth et al., 1997; Osiowy, 1998; Coiras et al., 2003] . In this respect, we decided not to use multiplex PCR to amplify different respiratory viruses to achieve maximal sensitivity. Instead, we grouped identical thermal profiles for PCR detection of respiratory viruses belonging to the same group, such as influenza viruses or hPIVs, which could therefore be amplified in the same amplification run. Specific amplification runs were carried out for the other viruses requesting individual thermal profiles. In addition, influenza A viruses could be subtyped, hPIVs typed and both hCoVs and hMPVs detected. Thus, the complete panel of the most important respiratory viruses could be sought. In addition, PCR was more efficient than MAbs in detecting coinfections.",

At that time, hCoV infections could be diagnosed only by serologic testing and hCoVs were considered responsible, along with rhinoviruses, for most of the common cold syndromes [McIntosh et al., 1970; Hamre and Been, 1972] . Recently, the development of molecular methods allowed to revisit the circulation and the spectrum of clinical syndromes caused by hCoVs [El-Sahly et al., 2000; Falsey et al., 2002a] , including lower respiratory tract infections of infants as well as the elderly and the immunocompromised patients [Pene et al., 2003; Vabret et al., 2003] .

The circulation of hMPV among infants and young children admitted to the hospital because of an acute respiratory infection suggests and confirms that hMPV may be associated with a severe lower respiratory tract infection, according to clinical and radiological patterns already recognized for hRSV. Both genotypes (or antigenic types) A and B were found to cocirculate in the same winter season including subgenotypes (or subtypes) A1 and A2, and B1 and B2 [van den Hoogen et al., 2004a] . hMPV circulation in Italy has been already reported [Maggi et al., 2003 ]. However, a very original finding of the Italian study was the detection of hMPV in blood of some infants with acute respiratory infection. This finding awaits confirmation from other laboratories. In our experience, no hMPV RNA could be detected by RT-PCR in blood of six infants with lower respiratory infection associated with hMPV during the acute phase of the infection (unpublished data). Whether the presence of hMPV in blood may be the result of a primary infection in an immunogically susceptible infant remains to be investigated. Recently, human rotavirus antigenemia was detected in blood of infants with acute gastroenteritis [Blutt et al., 2003] , while influenza virus A RNA and hAdV DNA were detected in blood of patients with acute encephalopathy associated with influenza A virus infection [Steininger et al., 2003 ].",

            "text": "Furthermore, of the 11 cases of respiratory virus coinfection diagnosed in this study, as many as 10 would have been missed without using RT-PCR. This result may somewhat be difficult to interpret. One can speculate that in cell cultures the presence of one virus may interfere with growth of another virus. On the other hand, PCR may detect nucleic acid sequences in respiratory samples belonging to viruses unable to grow in cell cultures. However, it may be difficult to discriminate whether the detection of two viruses is the expression of two simultaneous infections occurring in the same patient, or one virus represents the residual virus of a previous infection detected concomitantly with the virus causing the current infection. Virus quantification in nasopharyngeal aspirates might help in discriminating the etiologic role of each of the two viruses. Although varying among different studies, the coinfection rate is generally low [Coiras et al., 2003; van den Hoogen et al., 2003] ranging from 1 to 3% [van den Hoogen et al., 2004b] . However, whether coinfection represents a risk factor for more severe disease is uncertain. It has been reported that coinfection with hMPV and hRSV may worsen prognosis of a severe respiratory disease [Greensill et al., 2003] , whereas others reported a comparable rate of bronchopneumonia in children infected with hMPV alone or with mixed infections by hMPV and another respiratory virus [Maggi et al., 2003] . The role of respiratory virus coinfections in determining the severity of respiratory infections remains to be substantially determined. In our study, coinfections did not seem to worsen the prognosis of respiratory infections, because the most severe coinfections were those caused by hRSV in association with some other respiratory virus. Since hRSV is known to be significantly more associated with lower than upper respiratory tract infections and has been confirmed in this study, it appears reasonable to attribute the severity of coinfections involving hRSV in infants and young children to hRSV itself rather than the coinfecting virus.",

By using this approach, only viruses scarcely represented in respiratory samples would be lost, but this would not have a major impact on the clinical management of respiratory infections. However, if a single procedure can be used for diagnosis of acute respiratory infections, the molecular one should be preferred over the immunological approach because it is characterized by: greater overall rapidity; greater cost-effectiveness; and greater sensitivity in detecting respiratory viruses. A recent report showed the superiority of RT-PCR as compared to conventional viral culture in the diagnosis of acute respiratory infections in children by documenting an increased yield of viral identification by twofold .",
