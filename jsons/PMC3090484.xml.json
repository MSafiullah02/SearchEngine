            "text": "T cells identify foreign antigens through their T-cell receptor (TCR), which interacts with a peptide antigen in complex with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule in conjunction with CD4 or CD8 co-receptors (Meuer et al., 1982, Wang and Reinherz, 2002). For example, CD8+ T cells control viral infection through direct cytolysis of infected cells and through production of soluble antiviral mediators. This function is mediated by linear peptide epitopes presented by MHC class I molecules. CD4+ T cells recognize epitopes presented by MHC class II molecules on the surface of virus-infected cells and secrete lymphokines that stimulate B cells and cytotoxic T cells. The recognition of a given antigenic peptide by the immune system of an individual depends on the peptide's ability to bind one or more of the host's human leukocyte antigens (HLA, human MHC). There is a great diversity of HLA genes with more than 5000 known variants characterized as of April 2010 (Robinson et al., 2009). HLA proteins share three-dimensional structures with main differences observed in residues that form the peptide binding groove (Bjorkman et al., 1987). HLA proteins that have small differences in their peptide binding grooves and share similar peptide binding specificities are grouped into HLA supertypes (Sette and Sidney, 1999, Lund et al., 2004). Promiscuous peptides, i.e., those that bind multiple HLA variants, are suitable targets for peptide-based vaccine development because they are relevant for diverse HLA populations. Immunological hotspots, defined as regions comprising clusters of promiscuous T-cell epitopes, have been determined in some antigens, such as SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid (Gupta et al., 2006), HIV-1 proteins (Surman et al., 2001, Brown et al., 2003), or Chlamydia trachomatis outer membrane protein (Kim and DeMars, 2001). These clusters are suitable vaccine targets for the development of epitope-based vaccines. Such vaccines focus on a small number of selected hotspots that can potentially elicit required T-cell activation through multiple HLA molecules. Wet-lab experiments are time-consuming and costly and their applicability for large-scale screening is limited. Computational tools are essential for identifying T-cell epitopes and immunological hotspots for development of population-based vaccines. They are normally used for pre-screening of targets, followed by experimental validation using small number of well-selected target peptides.",

MULTIPRED is a computational system for prediction of promiscuous HLA binding peptides to HLA-A2, -A3, -B7, and -DR supertypes (Zhang et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2007). PEPVAC (Promiscuous EPitope-based VACcine) is a web server for multi-epitope vaccine development based on the prediction of supertypic MHC ligands (Reche and Reinherz, 2005). It predicts promiscuous peptide binders to five HLA class I supertypes, A2, A3, B7, A24, and B15. It also estimates the phenotypic population frequency of these supertypes. Hotspot Hunter is a computational system for large-scale screening and selection of candidate immunological hotspots in pathogen proteomes (Zhang et al., 2008). It allows screening and selection of hotspots specific to HLA-A2, -A3, -B7, and -DR supertype. Prediction of peptide binding to HLA molecules has been extensively studied. Peptide binding prediction to HLA class I was shown to be highly accurate for a number of HLA class I alleles (Lin et al., 2008a, Zhang et al., in press). Predictors of peptide binding to HLA class II molecules are less accurate than those for class I. However these prediction systems are improving over time and have acceptable accuracy for peptide pre-screening (Lin et al., 2008b). Recent benchmarking has shown the best performing systems for individual HLA predictions are NetMCHpan systems (Lundegaard et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Vaccine development requires multiple analyses ranging from predictions that involve a single HLA molecule and a single protein, to population-based studies where multiple sequence variants are analyzed for peptides that bind multiple HLA alleles. Computational vaccine development systems require handling of extended input information, such as multiple target antigens, multiple HLA predictors, and population properties. New visualization tools are needed to enable summarization of complex data required for vaccine development. Based on our previous developments - MULTPRED, PEPVAC, and NetMHCpan, we developed MULTIPRED2, a web-based system for prediction of peptide binding to products of individual HLA alleles, combination of alleles, and supertypes. MULTIPRED2 predicts promiscuous binders of 13 HLA class I supertypes (A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7, B8, B27, B44, B58, B62, C1, and C4) and 13 HLA Class II supertypes (DR1, DR3, DR4, DR6, DR7, DR8, DR9, DR11, DR12, DR13, DR14, DR15, and DR16). Supertype predictions utilize predefined combinations of HLA alleles. For more specific analysis, the user can input a single allele, or any combination of HLA alleles (such as an HLA haplotype, or an individual's genotype) and perform binding prediction for these selections. MULTIPRED2 integrates prediction results from multiple HLA supertypes and displays summary views of immunological hotspots. Heat map visualization is employed to show the global view of peptide binding affinities for many HLA molecules. A heat map is a two-dimensional representation of values in a data matrix coded as colors and shades. Combined with cluster analysis heat maps can elucidate fundamental patterns in complex data. The MULTIPRED2 heat map tool enables the visualization of predicted peptide binding affinities across the input protein and multiple HLA alleles. Another useful function of MULTIPRED2 is the calculation of population coverage for selected HLA alleles. This analysis has implication in determining the proportion of population for which the selected peptides are relevant as vaccine targets.",

            "text": "HLA genes are the most polymorphic human genes; HLA polymorphism must be taken into account in design of epitope-based vaccines. HLA alleles that show similar peptide binding specificity are grouped into supertypes (Sidney et al., 1996). The majority of HLA class I alleles cluster into nine HLA class I supertypes, A1, A2, A3, A24, B7, B27, B44, B58, and B62, largely based on their overlapping peptide binding repertoires and consensus structures in the main peptide binding pockets (Sette and Sidney, 1999). The definitions of HLA-A and -B supertypes in MULTIPRED2 are predicated upon a recent extension and update of the previous classification (Sidney et al., 2008). That classification approach relies on published binding motifs, binding data, and analyses of shared repertoires of binding peptides, and the primary sequence of the B and F peptide binding pockets. Four rules for allele assignment to supertypes were reported [24]. A sequence will be assigned to a supertype if it shares patterns with other members of that supertype, including (a) presence of experimentally established motifs, (b) exact matches of all residues in B and F pockets of the HLA groove, (c) one exact match for all residues and one exact match of key residues in pockets B and F, or (d) exact matches of key residues in B and F pockets. In MULTIPRED2 we only used allele assignments based on experimentally established motif or exact matches in the B and F pockets. One more HLA-A supertype, A26, has been included in MULTIPRED2. The definition of A26 alleles was based on the analysis of specificity matrices (Lund et al., 2004). The definition of HLA-C supertypes are based on structural similarities and molecular interaction fields calculated for the peptide binding sites (Doytchinova et al., 2004). The definition of HLA-DR supertypes in MULTIPRED2 are based on classification from the HLA dictionary (Holdsworth et al., 2009). The 671 alleles belonging to the 13 HLA class I supertypes are listed at http://cvc.dfci.harvard.edu/multipred2/HTML/reference.php#Q1. The 406 alleles belonging to the 13 HLA class II supertypes are listed at http://cvc.dfci.harvard.edu/multipred2/HTML/reference.php#Q2.",

The Pearson correlation distance measure is used for clustering HLA alleles together by their peptide binding preferences. When clustering peptides together by HLA specificity, the Euclidean distance is applied to avoid clustering weak binders together with strong binders. The HeatMapImage module creates the heat map as a JPEG image file. For this module the color scheme was set to global to ensure that shading corresponds directly with binding affinity. Network interfacing with GenePattern is achieved using the GenePattern java API.

Among the two proteins, 21 were predicted to bind HLA-A*0201, 10 were confirmed as binders, and a single conserved E7 9mer epitope, E711\u201319, was found by mass spectrometry to be expressed on HPV-16 transformed cells. In Silico prediction of potential T-cell epitopes was performed as the first screening step before HLA-A*0201 binding assay. In a final step, predictions on 116 HLA-A2 alleles indicated that E711\u201319 has the capacity to bind 100 of the 116 HLA-A2 alleles, indicating it is a suitable vaccine target across the majority of alleles within the HLA-A2 supertype.

The clustering feature groups HLA alleles by similarity of their binding profiles for a given antigen. This can help identify situations in which sub populations within a supertype must be targeted individually by vaccine components. Furthermore, clustering of peptides based on their HLA binding preference reveals redundancy of allelic coverage in peptide pools. Together, these visualization components inform the target selection process to maximize population coverage in peptide-based vaccines.",
