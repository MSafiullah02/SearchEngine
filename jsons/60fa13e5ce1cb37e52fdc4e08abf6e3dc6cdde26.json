GLEAM uses a metapopulation network approach integrated with real-world data where the world is divided into sub-populations centered around major transportation hubs (usually airports). The subpopulations are connected by the flux of individuals traveling daily among them. Population data are obtained from the high-resolution population database of the Gridded Population of the World project from the Socioeconomic Data and Application Center at Columbia University (sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu). The model considers geographical cells of 0.25 x 0.25 , corresponding to an approximately 25km x 25km square for cells along Earth's equator. Cells are then grouped into sub-populations defined by a Voronoi-like tessellation of the Earth's surface centered around major transportation hubs in different urban areas. The model includes over 3,200 sub-populations in roughly 200 different countries and territories (numbers vary by year). Sub-populations interact through the mechanistically simulated mobility and commuting patterns of disease carriers. Individuals who travel are randomly sampled from the \"origin\" population. The detailed algorithm is described in (5) . The airline transportation data consider daily origin-destination traffic flows from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) and IATA databases (updated 2019). Ground mobility/commuting flows are derived by the analysis and modeling of data collected from the Offices of Statistics for 30 countries on 5 continents. The full dataset contains about 80,000 administrative regions on 5 continents and over 5 million commuting flow connections between them (5).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 108, "end": 111, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 112, "end": 115, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 116, "end": 119, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 120, "end": 123, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 124, "end": 127, "text": "38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1298, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Material and Methods Global Epidemic and Mobility Model"}, {"text": "The disease model within each subpopulation assumes a compartmental representation of the disease under study. The epidemic evolution is modeled using an individual dynamic where transitions are mathematically defined by chain binomial and multinomial processes to preserve the discrete and stochastic nature of the transmission and disease evolution process. Each subpopulation's disease dynamic is coupled with the other subpopulations through the mechanistically simulated travel and commuting patterns of disease carriers. Within each sub-population, the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 is modeled using a compartmental representation of the disease where individuals can occupy one of the following compartments: Susceptible (S), Latent (L), Infectious (I) and Recovered (R). Susceptible individuals can acquire the virus through contacts with individuals in the infectious compartment, and become latent, meaning they are infected but can not transmit the disease yet. Latent individuals progress to the infectious stage with a rate inversely proportional to the latent period (which we assume to have the same duration as the incubation period), and infectious individuals progress into the removed stage with a rate inversely proportional to the infectious period. The sum of the mean latent and infectious periods defines the generation time. Disease carriers travel during the entire latency and infectious period and are not traveling when they enters the removed stage identifying those who can no longer infect others, meaning they are recovered, isolated, hospitalized, or dead. The model works in discrete time steps, representing a full day, to implement computationally the air travel, the compartmental transitions (where the force of infection takes into account both the infection dynamics and the short-range movement of individuals), and the partial aggregation of the results at the desired level of geographic resolution. All the technical details of the model have been previously published (5, 7) . The model is fully stochastic and for each nominally identical initialization (initial conditions and disease model) generates an ensemble of possible epidemic evolutions for epidemic observables, such as newly generated cases, time of arrival of the infection, and number of traveling carriers. Parameter ranges for the latent and infectious period, and generation time are derived from early estimates on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, as well as plausible ranges from the SARS epidemic (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) .

The evidence D is the growth rate of imported COVID-19 cases to international locations during the exponential growth of the epidemic.
