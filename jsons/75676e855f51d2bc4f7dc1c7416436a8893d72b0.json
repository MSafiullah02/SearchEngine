In this study, we identify ITZ as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of enteroviruses (e.g., poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus-71, rhinovirus). We demonstrate that ITZ inhibits viral RNA replication by targeting oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and OSBP-related protein 4 (ORP4). Consistently, OSW-1, a specific OSBP/ORP4 antagonist, also inhibits enterovirus replication. Knockdown of OSBP inhibits virus replication, whereas overexpression of OSBP or ORP4 counteracts the antiviral effects of ITZ and OSW-1. ITZ binds OSBP and inhibits its function, i.e., shuttling of cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol-4phosphate between membranes, thereby likely perturbing the virus-induced membrane alterations essential for viral replication organelle formation. ITZ also inhibits hepatitis C virus replication, which also relies on OSBP. Together, these data implicate OSBP/ORP4 as molecular targets of ITZ and point to an essential role of OSBP/ORP4-mediated lipid exchange in virus replication that can be targeted by antiviral drugs. , et al.

            "text": "The genome of enteroviruses consists of a 7.5 kb singlestranded RNA molecule of positive polarity [(+)RNA]. It encodes a single polyprotein that is proteolytically processed by the viral proteases into the structural proteins (VP1-VP4) and the nonstructural proteins (2A-2C and 3A-3D). The viral genome is replicated by assemblies of viral and host proteins located on intracellular membranes termed replication organelles (ROs). The ROs are formed as a result of virus-induced remodeling of secretory pathway membranes, which most likely starts at the Golgi complex (Hsu et al., 2010) , eventually resulting in a complex network of tubulovesicular membranes (Belov et al., 2012; Limpens et al., 2011) . Viral modification of lipid homeostasis is thought to play a major role in RO formation. Viral proteins 2BC and 3A play a major role in the membrane rearrangements by recruiting essential host factor for enterovirus replication to ROs, such as phosphatidylinositol-phosphate-4-kinase III beta (PI4KIIIb), a Golgi-localized lipid kinase that generates phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate (PI4P) (Arita, 2014; Hsu et al., 2010) . The functional importance of elevated PI4P levels at ROs remains to be established. The viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, 3D pol , binds PI4P in vitro, but it is unknown whether this is important for its recruitment and/or activation in infected cells (Hsu et al., 2010) . Alternatively, the PI4P lipids may participate in RO formation by facilitating the recruitment of PI4P-binding host proteins with membrane-modifying properties.",

            "text": "Recently, oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) was shown to play a key role in the transport of cholesterol and PI4P between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi . OSBP links ER and trans-Golgi membranes at so-called ER-Golgi membrane contact sites (MCSs) and shuttles sterol into the Golgi and PI4P back to the ER, where it is hydrolyzed by the PI4P-phosphatase Sac1. This cholesterol/PI4P exchange cycle drives the delivery of sterol in the trans-Golgi and self-regulates the localization of OSBP on the Golgi. OSBP and the OSBP-related proteins (ORPs) constitute a family of related proteins that, based on gene structure and sequence, can be subdivided into six subfamilies. OSBP and its closest relative, ORP4 (also called OSBP2), belong to subfamily I. All ORPs have a lipid-binding domain that was initially thought to be specific for sterols. However, recent structural analysis suggests that ORPs have the ability to bind PI4P and a second lipid that is either a sterol or a nonsterol ligand. Many ORPs, including OSBP, have an FFAT-motif that is recognized by ER-resident VAP receptors and an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for binding PI4P, through which they are linked to a variety of organelles. Although the functions of most ORPs are not very well understood, it has become clear that ORPs execute diverse functions in lipid sensing, lipid transport, and cell signaling (Raychaudhuri and Prinz, 2010; Weber-Boyvat et al., 2013) .",

Similar collections of FDA-approved drugs have proven to be rich sources of undiscovered bioactivity and therapeutic potential. We identified itraconazole (ITZ) as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of enterovirus replication. ITZ is a well-known antifungal drug that inhibits CYP51, a cytochrome P450 required for sterol biosynthesis (Lestner and Hope, 2013) . In addition, ITZ exerts anticancer activity by inhibiting angiogenesis-through disturbing mTOR signaling and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) trafficking-and the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway (Kim et al., 2010; Nacev et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2010) . ITZ has been found to be efficacious in patients with several cancer types in multiple phase 2 clinical studies (Antonarakis et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014; Rudin et al., 2013) . We demonstrate that known targets of ITZ cannot explain the antiviral activity of ITZ. Instead, evidence is presented that OSBP and ORP4 are novel targets of ITZ and that direct binding of ITZ to OSBP, which localizes at ROs, disrupts its lipid-shuttling function, and accounts for the antiviral effect of ITZ.",

Like all enteroviruses, CVB3 kills its host cell and thereby causes a ''cytopathic effect'' (CPE). We screened the NCC by microscopically observing which compounds prevented the development of CPE in a multicycle replication assay and identified ITZ ( Figure S1 ) as one of the hits. To determine its spectrum of antiviral activity, we tested ITZ against a representative panel of picornaviruses in a multicycle CPE-reduction assay. ITZ exhibited antiviral effect against all enteroviruses examined (belonging to several species) with 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) values between 0.3 mM and 1.6 mM (Table S1 ). In addition, EMCV, a Cardiovirus genus member, was inhibited by ITZ. In contrast, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV; Aphthovirus genus member) and HPeV-1 (Parechovirus genus member) were insensitive to ITZ. To exclude the possibility that the antiviral activity was due to toxic side effects, we determined the effect of ITZ on virus production during a single replication cycle. Similar to the multicycle CPE-reduction assay, ITZ was active against CVB3, EV71, HRV14, and EMCV, but not ERAV, in a single replication cycle ( Figure 1A ) without apparent toxicity ( Figure 1B ). ITZ also inhibited Saffold virus (SAFV) replication, a human cardiovirus ( Figure 1A ). Thus, ITZ exerts broad antiviral activity against enteroviruses and cardioviruses.",

ITZ has also been shown to have some inhibitory activity toward the human CYP51 (hCYP51) and the related cytochrome P450 CYP3A4. In addition to ITZ, other azole family antifungal drugs, including posaconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and voriconazole ( Figure S1 ), also inhibit hCYP51 and CYP3A4 with slightly lower or similar potency as ITZ (Warrilow et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012) . We tested whether these drugs exert antiviral activity using recombinant viruses RLuc-CVB3 and RLuc-EMCV, which carry the Renilla luciferase gene upstream of the coding region. At 10 mM, only posaconazole inhibited replication of RLuc-CVB3 and RLuc-EMCV. The remaining azoles did not display any antiviral activity at concentrations up to 100 mM . Similar results were obtained in a multicycle CPE-reduction assay (not shown). These results ruled out the possibility that inhibition of hCYP51 or CYP3A4 underlies the antiviral activity of ITZ and its structurally related analog posaconazole.",

We found that cholesterol, stained with filipin, was redistributed not only by ITZ and posaconazole but also by ketoconazole (which does not inhibit virus replication) in two human cell lines (HAP1 [ Figure 2C ] and HeLa R19 cells [ Figure S3E ]).

CVB3 carrying mutation 3A[H57Y] -which confers resistance to PI4KIIIb inhibitors (e.g., PIK93, enviroxime, GW5074) (van der Schaar et al., 2012)-proved less sensitive to ITZ than wild-type (WT) CVB3 in both a single-cycle replication assay ( Figure 2E ) and a multicycle CPE-reduction assay ( Figure 2F ). Other mutations in 3A that were shown to protect against PI4KIIIb inhibitors (i.e., V45A and I54F) (van der Schaar et al., 2012), also provided cross-resistance to ITZ ( Figure 2G ). Similarly, mutation A70T in PV 3A, which was also shown to protect against PI4KIIIb inhibitors (Arita et al., 2009) , protected PV against ITZ ( Figure 2H ).

To assess whether any of the known PI4P-binding proteins could be a target of ITZ, we performed a target identification by small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitization (TISS) assay (Arita et al., 2010) . TISS encompasses siRNA knockdown of candidate target proteins to potentiate the biological effect of a low concentration of a compound. Among a number of PI4Pbinding, Golgi-localized proteins, knockdown of OSBP, but not any of the other PH domain-containing proteins, enhanced the inhibitory effect of a low concentration (1.25 mM) of ITZ on PV replication ( Figure 3A ), implying OSBP as a possible antiviral target of ITZ. We further assessed this possibility by several experiments. First, the OSBP antagonist OSW-1 (Burgett et al., 2011) potently inhibited CVB3 replication ( Figure 3B ), confirming that pharmacological targeting of OSBP can inhibit enterovirus replication. As for ITZ, the 3A[H57Y] mutation in CVB3 provided resistance against OSW-1 ( Figure 3B ). Akin to ITZ, OSW-1 inhibited all enteroviruses tested as well as EMCV, but not ERAV (data not shown). Importantly, OSW-1 did not affect endolysosomal cholesterol distribution ( Figure 3C ), supporting our previous conclusion that this effect unlikely explains the antiviral effect of ITZ. Second, similar as for PV (Wang et al., 2014) , siRNA knockdown of OSBP inhibited replication of EV71 and HRV2 (Figure 3D) . CVB3 replication was also inhibited by OSBP knockdown, but this difference was not statistically significant, in line with the lower sensitivity of CVB3 than EV71 to ITZ ( Figure 1A ). Third, overexpression of OSBP restored replication of CVB3 and EV71 in the presence of ITZ or OSW-1 ( Figure 3E ), confirming that inhibition of viral replication by ITZ and OSW-1 is mediated through OSBP. Overexpression of PI4KIIIb failed to rescue replication, and OSBP overexpression did not provide rescue against PI4KIIIb inhibitors (data not shown), indicating the specificity of the experimental setup.",

We also attempted to test the effect of ORP4 depletion. Although in the TISS assay, ORP4 knockdown potentiated the effect of ITZ, we were not able to achieve robust knockdown (>75% at mRNA level), and therefore we cannot conclude unambiguously whether ORP4 is important for virus replication. Problems with ORP4 knockdown were also observed by others and are likely due to an essential role of ORP4 in cell proliferation and survival (Charman et al., 2014) .

EC 50 values for inhibition of HCV replication by ITZ were comparable to those obtained for the enteroviruses (Table  S1 ). Together, our data clearly demonstrate that ITZ inhibits OSBP function and that viruses from different families that depend on OSBP function can be inhibited by ITZ.

Because of available tools, we focused on OSBP for the remainder of this study. In line with published data (Burgett et al., 2011) , OSW-1 caused a massive recruitment of overexpressed GFP-OSBP to the Golgi apparatus (as marked by staining endogenous PI4KIIIb) ( Figure 4A ). A similar relocalization was observed for endogenous OSBP ( Figure 4B ). ITZ and posaconazole, but not the azoles that lacked antiviral activity, redistributed OSBP in a manner that is similar to OSW-1. Live-cell imaging was performed to study the dynamics of GFP-OSBP relocalization by the compounds. Before addition of the compounds, GFP-OSBP primarily localized in the cytosol with a Golgi pattern faintly visible. A few minutes after the addition of the compounds, (C) HAP1 cells were treated for 6 hr with 10 nM OSW-1 or 10 mM ITZ, fixed, and stained with filipin. (D) HeLa R19 cells were transfected with constructs encoding OSBP or EGFP (negative control) for 24 hr, infected with RLuc-CVB3 at MOI 0.25 or EV71 at MOI 1, and treated with 10 mM (CVB3) or 3 mM (EV71) ITZ, 3 nM OSW-1, or DMSO. Renilla luciferase levels were determined at 7 hr p.i. (CVB3) or virus titers at 10 hr p.i. were determined by endpoint titration (EV71). (E) HeLa R19 cells were transfected with siRNAs against OSBP, PI4KIIIb (positive control), or a scrambled siRNA for 2 days and infected with CVB3, EV71, or HRV2 at MOI 1. Virus titers at 10 hr p.i. were determined by endpoint titration. Knockdown efficiency was determined by quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence ( Figure S5 ), and an MTS assay was used to test for effects on cell viability. (F) HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting ORP family members (roman numbering indicates ORP subfamilies), infected, treated with ITZ, and analyzed as in (A). (G) HeLa R19 cells were transfected with constructs encoding OSBP, ORP4, or enhanced GFP, infected and treated with 3 nM OSW-1, and data were analyzed as in ( (C) HeLa R19 cells were transfected with GFP-OSBP and treated with DMSO, 10 mM of ITZ, or 10 nM OSW-1, and the relocalization of OSBP was imaged by livecell confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cells were imaged overnight. During the first 30 min, images were taken as fast as possible (1.5 min intervals), then intervals were stepwise increased to 30 min from 3.5 hr onward. Representative groups of cells are shown. The images are frames from Movie S1. (D) Quantification of the relative GFP-OSBP signal at the Golgi apparatus in five cells for each condition from (C). Error bars indicate SEM. Scale bar corresponds to 10 mm. See also Movie S1. GFP-OSBP fluorescence at the Golgi was clearly increased in cells treated with either ITZ or OSW-1 and continued to increase at the expense of the cytoplasmic signal ( Figures 4C and 4D ; Movie S1). OSW-1 was previously reported to disrupt the structure of the Golgi apparatus (Burgett et al., 2011) , which we also observed from 30 to 60 min onward as GFP-positive punctae that became more numerous over time ( Figure 4C ). In ITZtreated cells, the Golgi pattern became affected only hours later and appeared less dispersed than that in OSW-1 treated cells.",

ITZ inhibited the sterol-transfer activity of purified OSBP in a dose-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 200 nM ( Figure 5B ). At 1 mM, ITZ and posaconazole, but not the other selected azoles, strongly inhibited DHE transfer transport in this liposomal assay, although they were less potent than the known OSBP ligand 25OH ( Figure 5C ). We also observed a dose-dependent inhibition of PI4P transfer by ITZ (IC 50 = 4 mM) ( Figure 5E ). Posaconazole slightly inhibited PI4P, whereas the other azoles showed no activity ( Figure 5F ). For unknown reasons, a stimulatory effect of 25OH on PI4P transfer was observed, which depended on the 2% cholesterol content of the ER-like liposomes. The IC 50 values suggest that ITZ is more potent toward sterol than PI4P transfer. Importantly, for technical reasons, the sterol and PI4P-shuttling assays are performed under different conditions and therefore cannot be directly compared. Further investigations would be needed to establish whether ITZ indeed more potently inhibits sterol than PI4P shuttling.",

Previously, it was shown that the ORD-derived fragments retain lipid transfer activity, also in the absence of the inactive 43 kDa fragment . We found that ITZ still inhibited both DHE ( Figure 5K ) and PI4P ( Figure 5L ) transfer by OSBP that had been subjected to tryptic proteolysis ( Figure S7A ).

ITZ altered the thermophoretic profiles of purified GFP-OSBP ( Figures S7B and S7C ) in a dose-dependent manner, indicating direct binding. Normalization and fitting of data from three independent measurements demonstrated that ITZ binds to OSBP with a K D of 430 nM ( Figure 5M ).

In infected cells, OSBP localization was markedly changed, i.e., the Golgi pattern was lost and OSBP appeared in dispersed structures throughout (M) The interaction of ITZ with GFP-tagged OSBP was investigated using MST.

Elucidation of the mechanism of action of inhibitors of virus replication has proven instrumental in obtaining novel insights into the mechanisms of viral replication. In this study we identified ITZ, a widely used antifungal drug that is currently also being explored as an anticancer agent, as a novel, broad-spectrum inhibitor of enteroviruses, cardioviruses, and HCV. We show that none of the well-established targets of ITZ (i.e., hCYP51, mTOR, VEGFR2, Hh) explains its antiviral activity. Instead, we identified the PI4P-binding proteins OSBP and ORP4 as novel targets of ITZ through which the antiviral effect is mediated.",

OSBP is the prototype member of the family of ORPs, a group of proteins whose cellular functions have remained poorly understood. We identified OSBP and ORP4 as targets of ITZ. Pharmacologic inhibition, siRNA knockdown, and rescue of replication by overexpression demonstrate the importance of these proteins for virus replication. Furthermore, OSBP localized to ROs in a PI4-KIIIb-and PI4P-dependent manner. ITZ directly bound purified OSBP and inhibited both the cholesterol and PI4P-transport activities of OSBP in vitro (in liposomal assays). Also in living (uninfected) cells, ITZ inhibited the transport function of OSBP (i.e., transport of cholesterol from ER to Golgi and transport of PI4P from Golgi to ER), leading to an increase in PI4P levels at the Golgi, thereby causing the accumulation of OSBP. Likewise, in infected cells, ITZ increased PI4P levels on ROs, again leading to an enhanced recruitment of OSBP, and inhibited the accumulation of cholesterol on ROs.

We here show that OSBP is subsequently recruited to ROs via PI4P. Our data indicate that at ER-RO MCSs, OSBP exchanges PI4P for cholesterol, either newly synthesized in the ER or originating from a lipid droplet storage pool and being mobilized through the ER, leading to an accumulation of cholesterol at the ROs (Arita, 2014) . Our findings are in agreement with those of a recent paper that suggested that OSBP shuttles cholesterol to HRV ROs based on the inhibitory effects on HRV replication of OSBP knockdown and 25OH treatment (Roulin et al., 2014) . The finding that the levels of cholesterol are elevated at the expense of cholesterylesters (i.e., the form in which cholesterol is stored in lipid droplets) in enterovirus-infected cells (Ilnytska et al., 2013; Roulin et al., 2014) suggests that stored cholesterol is mobilized for transport to ROs. In addition, uptake of cholesterol by endocytosis has been suggested to contribute to the accumulation of cholesterol at ROs (Ilnytska et al., 2013) . The role of cholesterol accumulation at ROs is far from established. Cholesterol is of profound importance for membranes properties such as membrane fluidity and formation of lipid microdomains, and it is thereby likely important for the membrane rearrangements and deformations underlying RO formation. In addition, cholesterol alterations have been suggested to affect viral polyprotein processing efficiency (Ilnytska et al., 2013) .",

At ER-Golgi MCSs, it acts in concert with the PI transfer protein Nir2, which supplies PI for PI4P synthesis at Golgi membranes, and CERT, which transfers ceramide to Golgi for sphingomyelin synthesis, thereby generating diacylglycerols (DAGs) (Peretti et al., 2008) . Importantly OSBP ligands, e.g., 25OH and OSW-1, change the localization of CERT and modify sphingomyelin synthesis (Burgett et al., 2011; Perry and Ridgway, 2006) . As an inhibitor of OSBP-mediated lipid shuttling, ITZ may thus not only affect the accumulation of cholesterol but also perturb the homeostasis of other lipids, such as sphingomyelin and DAGs. Whether and how this contributes to the inhibition of RO formation and/or function remains to be established.",

Unfortunately, little is known about the biological function of ORP4. Roles for ORP4 are proposed in organization of the cytoskeletal vimentin network, cell proliferation and survival, and sterol transfer (Charman et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2002a) . However, unlike OSBP, ORP4 does not localize to the Golgi under normal conditions or in response to a ligand such as 25OH (Charman et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2002a) . It therefore seems unlikely that ORP4 transports cholesterol between the ER and Golgi in a similar manner as OSBP. How ORP4 overexpression can counteract the inhibitory effect of ITZ on virus replication thus remains to be established. It is possible that OSBP-ORP4 heteromultimers (Wyles et al., 2007) are important for virus replication, but this requires further investigation. Besides OSBP and ORP4, other ORPs did not appear to be targeted by ITZ, though they may still be important for virus replication.",

It remains to be established whether OSBP inhibition contributes to the anticancer activities of ITZ via these pathways. OSBP overexpression, which we showed to counter the antiviral activity of ITZ, failed to prevent the inhibitory effects of ITZ on mTOR and Hh signaling (not shown). These observations suggest that ITZ does not inhibit these antitumor pathways through OSBP, but we cannot exclude that the overexpression approach can only neutralize the antiviral effect of ITZ. Therefore, more work is needed to establish whether or not ITZ exerts its antitumor activities via OSBP and/or ORP4. OSW-1 and several other natural products were recently reported to inhibit the growth of cultured human cancer cell lines through OSBP and ORP4 and therefore collectively termed ORPphilins (Burgett et al., 2011) . Our data that ITZ targets OSBP and ORP4 justify classifying ITZ as a novel ORPphilin. It is plausible that ITZ inhibits OSBP/ORP4-dependent cancer cell growth and survival in a manner independent of, and in addition to, mTOR, VEGFR2, and Hh. Recently, two inhibitors of PV replication were shown to target OSBP and ORP4 (Arita et al., 2013) , although binding to OSBP has yet to be shown, and may therefore also classify as ORPphilins.",

            "text": "In vitro DHE and PI4P transport assays Previously described liposomal assays were used to test the sterol and PI4P transfer activities of OSBP (schematically depicted in Figures 6A and 6B, respectively) . Briefly, sterol transfer is measured using the fluorescent cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol (DHE). DHE is transferred by OSBP from ER-like liposomes (ER like ) covered with VAP-A to Golgi-like liposomes (Golgil ike ) doped with dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DNS-PE). Upon DHE transfer, there will be F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from DHE to DNS-PE due to the close proximity between the two fluorophores. In the PI4P-transfer assay, PI4P is transported by OSBP from Golgi-like liposomes to ER-like acceptor liposomes and detected using a sensor consisting of the FAPP1 PHdomain labeled with the fluorophore NBD ( NBD PH). When the sensor is bound to PI4P on the Golgi-like liposomes doped with rhodamine-PE (Rho-PE), NBD fluorescence is quenched by the rhodamine. Upon transfer of PI4P to the ER-like liposomes, the sensor moves from the Golgi-like to the ER-like liposomes and NBD-fluorescence is dequenched. Egg PC (L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine), liver PI (L-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol), brain PS (L-\u03b1phosphatidylserine), brain PI4P (L-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate), Dansyl (DNS)-PE (1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)), Rhodamine (Rhod)-PE (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)), DOGS-NTA-Ni 2+ (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)succinyl]) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Cholesterol and dehydroergosterol (DHE) were from Sigma Aldrich. The concentration of DHE in stock solution in methanol was determined by UV-spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 13,000 M -1 .cm -1 . Full-length OSBP, VAP-A[8-212]His 6, NBD-PH FAPP1 and Arf1 were purified as described previously . To prepare liposomes, lipids from chloroform solutions were mixed at the desired molar ratio, and the solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator. The lipid film was hydrated in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 and 120 mM potassium acetate (HK buffer) to give a suspension of large multilamellar liposomes. The suspension was then frozen and thawed five times and extruded through polycarbonate filters of 0.1 \u03bcm pore size using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Unilamellar liposomes were stored in the dark and used within 2 days. For all transport experiment, ER-like liposomes contain: egg PC/brain PS/DOGS-NTA-Ni2 + (93/5/2 mol/mol) and Golgi-like liposomes contain: egg PC/liver PE/brain PS/liver PI/DNS-PE (63.5/19/5/10/2.5 mol/mol). Fluorescence experiments were performed in a Shimadzu RF-5301-PC spectrofluorimeter. The sample (volume 600 \u03bcl) was placed in a cylindrical quartz cell, continuously stirred with a small magnetic bar and equilibrated at 37\u00b0C. For DHE transfer assays, Golgi-like liposomes with 2.5 mol% DNS-PE (63.3 \u03bcM total lipids) were loaded with Arf1.GTP (0.3 \u03bcM) and incubated with 1 \u03bcM VapA[8-212]His 6 in HKM buffer (HK buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgCl 2 ) in the presence of 25-OH, ITZ or other azoles (different stock concentration in DMSO, DMSO/buffer final ratio v/v 1/100), prior to the addition of ER-like liposomes supplemented with 18 mol% DHE (63.3 \u03bcM total lipids) and of OSBP (100 nM final concentration). The sterol transport activity of OSBP was monitored by FRET between DHE and DNS-PE, measured at 525 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) upon excitation at 310 nm (bandwidth 1.5 nm). Methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (1 mM) was used to determine the maximal FRET signal due to full sterol equilibration between ER-like and Golgi-like liposomes. For PI4P transfer assay, Golgi-like liposomes with 2% Rhod-PE (300 \u03bcM total lipids) were incubated in HKM buffer with 250 nM NBD-PH FAPP , 3 \u03bcM VAP-A[8-212]His 6 in the presence or not of ITZ or other azoles (at different stock concentration, in DMSO). PI4P transport was followed by measuring the NBD emission signal at 510 nm (bandwidth 10 nm) upon excitation at 460 nm (bandwidth 1.5 nm). ER-like liposomes (300 \u03bcM lipid) and 100 nM OSBP were sequentially added. Maximal signal corresponding to PI4P equilibration between both types of liposomes was determined by mixing control ER-and Golgi-like liposomes, each containing 1% PI4P.",

Individual experiments were analyzed using the NTAnalysis software (NanoTemper Technologies), normalized fluorescence values of individual experiments (Fnorm[1/1000]) were exported to Excel, base-line corrected by substracting the average of the first three values (lowest ITZ concentrations, plateau for OSBP with no ITZ bound), and normalized to maximal binding using the amplitude calculated for each measurement by the NTAnalysis software. Data of three individual experiments were averaged. Data were plotted and a curve was fitted with the fit function from the law of mass action. To investigate whether ITZ affected viral polyprotein synthesis or processing, we analyzed viral proteins at 4.5 h p.i. when production of host proteins is severely suppressed because of the virusinduced shut-off of cap-dependent translation. Specifically, BGM cells were infected with CVB3 at MOI 50. At 4 hr p.i., cells were starved for methionine for 30 min and subsequently incubated with [35S]methionine in the presence of DMSO or 25 \u03bcM ITZ for another 30 min. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The levels of viral proteins were similar in the absence or presence of ITZ, indicating that viral polyprotein synthesis and processing were unaffected by ITZ. Figure 2 , and Renilla luciferase levels were measured after 7 hr. Acute toxicity of the drug treatments was analyzed in parallel using an MTS assay as in Figure 1B (C). The toxicity of treatment with 100 \u03bcM ketoconazole prevents drawing a conclusion about any antiviral effect of this drug concentration on CVB3. (D) HeLa R19 cells were infected with RLuc-EMCV, treated with Hedgehog pathway antagonists as in Figure 2 , and Renilla luciferase levels were measured after 6 hr. (E) HeLa R19 cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM antifungal azoles for 6 hr, fixed and cholesterol was stained with filipin. Cholesterol was redistributed only by ITZ, posaconazole and ketoconazole, but not by fluconazole or voriconazole. (F) HeLa R19 cells were infected with RLuc-EMCV, treated with \u03b2estradiol as in Figure 2 , and Renilla luciferase levels were measured after 6 hr. Scale bars correspond to 10 \u03bcm. Asterisks indicate statistical significance compared to the DMSO control. D, DMSO; Gu, Guanidine HCl (known replication inhibitor of CVB3); Posa, posaconazole; Keto, ketoconazole; Flu, fluconazole; Vori, voriconazole. (A) HeLa cells stably expressing the PI4P-sensor FAPP1-PH-GFP were treated with DMSO, 1 \u03bcM BF738735 (PI4KIII\u03b2 inhibitor), or 10 \u03bcM ITZ for 2.5 hr, fixed and processed for microscopy. (B) HeLa R19 cells were treated as in (B), fixed and stained with an antibody against PI4P. (C) ITZ does not inhibit PI4P accumulation in infected cells. HeLa R19 cells were infected with CVB3 at MOI 10 and immediately after infection treated with DMSO or 10 \u03bcM ITZ, which does not fully inhibit replication. At 5 hr p.i., the cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against 3A and PI4P. Scale bars correspond to 10 \u03bcm. HeLa R19 cells were transfected with siRNA against OSBP or a scrambled siRNA as a negative control as in Figure 3D . After 48 hr, cells were fixed and immunostained for OSBP and GM130 as Golgi marker, and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Knockdown of OSBP at the protein level is evident by a weaker OSBP staining both on Golgi structures and throughout the cytoplasm. Of note, OSBP knockdown caused the Golgi to become less compact, which at the same time demonstrates that knockdown was efficient enough to induce a physiological effect. The scale bar corresponds to 10 \u03bcm. Huh 9-13 cells carrying a HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon were treated with ITZ or other antifungal azoles and replication was determined after 3 days by Q-PCR. Values are plotted as % of untreated control (UTC), experiments were performed in triplicates and mean \u00b1 SEM are plotted. EC50 values are means \u00b1 SD from an experiment performed in triplicate. For all compounds, 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) were >30 \u03bcM (data not shown).",

(G-J) The effect of ITZ on binding of an N-terminal OSBP fragment (amino acids 76-408; PH-FFAT) to ER-like (G and H) and Golgi-like (I and J) liposomes was examined by liposomal float-up assays as outlined in (G) and (I). Liposomal fractions were analyzed for binding of proteins by SDS-PAGE (H and J). (K and L) The effect of ITZ and control compounds on DHE (K) or PI4P (L) transfer by trypsinized OSBP was studied as with full-length OSBP (A-F).",
