This includes terms such as \u201cwash hands\u201d and \u201csocial distancing\u201d. As shown in Fig. 1\n, a worldwide search revealed a first significant increase in the search term \u201cwash hands\u201d, culminating on March 13. \u201cSocial distancing\u201d rises from March 9 to a first peak on March 22 and a second peak on March 30. Furthermore, terms may reflect an increased concern or fear of infection among the population, such as \u201cCOVID-19 symptoms\u201d. Searches have increased since February 23, 2020 and peaked on March 23. After the name COVID-19 was introduced in early February, the curve of the search term for symptoms of COVID-19 fits well with the course of the more general term \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, which Strzelecki shows in the representation of a second wave of interest (Strzelecki, 2020). \u201cPanic buying\u201d was used as a substitute marker for concerns about supply shortages and generated an early peak on March 15 (Fig. 1).",
