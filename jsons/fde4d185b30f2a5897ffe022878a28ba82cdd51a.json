Although the primary function of ubiquitin was initially associated with proteolysis, it is now considered as a key regulator of protein function controlling, among other functions, signalling cascades, transcription, apoptosis or oncogenesis. Failure at any level of the UPS is associated with the development of multiple pathologies including metabolic problems, immune diseases, infl ammation and cancer. The successful use of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Velcade) in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) revealed the potential of the UPS as pharmacological target. Ten years later, new inhibitors tackling not only the proteasome but also different subsets of enzymes which conjugate or de-conjugate ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like molecules, have been developed. Most of them are excellent tools to characterize better the emerging molecular mechanisms regulating distinct critical cellular processes. Some of them have been launched already while many others are still in pre-clinical development. This chapter updates some of the most successful efforts to develop and characterize inhibitors of the UPS which tackle mechanisms involved in cancer. Particular attention has been dedicated to updating the status of the clinical trials of these inhibitors.",

Most of our initial understanding of this pathway comes from biochemical approaches and genetic studies in yeast (reviewed in Weissman et al. 2011 ). Knowledge about the physiological roles of the UPS in mammalian cells was quite slow until cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors were developed (Palombella et al. 1994 ; Tsubuki et al. 1993 ) . Proteasome inhibitors helped to demonstrate that 26S and 20S proteasomes contribute to the degradation of most short-lived and long-lived proteins that exhibit critical functions inside the cell such as transcription, apoptosis or cell cycle regulation, either through ubiquitin-dependent or ubiquitin-independent mechanisms (Glass and Gerner 1987 ; Tanaka et al. 1983 ) . Consequently, UPS deregulation is linked to different human pathologies (Schwartz and Ciechanover 1999 ) . In this chapter, we will focus on UPS inhibitors used in the treatment of cancer.",

            "text": "Ubiquitin and all members of the ubiquitin family are attached to protein substrates through biochemical processes which are similar but implicate distinct sets of enzymes with the capacity to act on a limited number of reactions ( Fig. 11 .1 ). All protein modifi ers of the ubiquitin family are generated through the proteolytical cleavage of higher molecular weight precursors that exposes the double glycine (GG) signature, typically found in this family, and which is required for their attachment to protein substrates (reviewed in Jentsch and Pyrowolakis 2000 ) . The attachment (or conjugation) of ubiquitin or UbL modifi ers is mediated by a thiol-ester cascade of reactions that requires the action of three enzymes: an activating enzyme or E1 that will activate all molecules required for all reactions and a conjugating enzyme or E2 that, in most cases, will conjugate protein modifi ers to their targets. Ubiquitin ligases or E3s are responsible for, or are required to achieve the conjugation of the modifi er to its target protein ( Fig. 11 .1 ). The role that an E3 will exert depends on its capacity to form thiol-ester intermediates with protein modifi ers. .1 Available drugs in clinical trials to block the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System . All members of the ubiquitin family are generated through a high molecular weight precursor that has to be cleaved by specifi c proteases to generate the mature form of each modifi er. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin is mediated by a thiol-ester cascade of reactions involving at least three enzymes: an activating enzyme (AE) or E1; a conjugating enzyme (CE) or E2; and a ligase (LE) or E3. Ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMO or NEDD8 have their own set of enzymes. Demodifying enzymes such as DUBs, SUSPs or NEDP1 participate in a proofreading mechanism. Multiple chain types can be formed and the composition of the chains is essential to drive distinct functions, including proteolysis by the 26S proteasome 228 The ubiquitin ligases of the HECT family are typical examples of these active enzymes. Another category of E3 ligases contributes to bring together substrates and E2s in order to achieve protein conjugation without having any enzymatic activity. Among this category of E3s, we found the cullin-RING ligase (CRLs) composed of multiple subunits that will allow the specifi c recognition of a degradable substrate (e.g. after its phosphorylation). The contribution of E4 factors favouring chain extension has also been proposed (Hoppe 2005 ) . Chain formation is essential to drive distinct functions. While ubiquitin chain linkages K48 and K11 have been associated with degradation, K63 chains appear to connect signalling cascades, endocytic traffi cking or DNA repair. The formation of hybrid chains containing ubiquitin and UbLs such as SUMO2/3 is also possible (Aillet et al. 2012 ; Guzzo and Matunis 2013 ; Kulathu and Komander 2012 ) but a generic function of these chains has not been established. Deubiquitylating enzymes or DUBs recognize specifi c ubiquitin chains from target substrates through ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) to know which chains should be cleaved (Eletr and Wilkinson 2014 ) . An equivalent reaction is achieved by SUMO-specifi c proteases (SUSPs) or NEDD8 specifi c protease (NEDP1), also known as Denedylase 1 (DEN1) (Hickey et al. 2012 ) . All isopeptidases show specifi city for a modifi er, however due to saturated in vitro assays, overexpression or certain stress conditions, cross-reactions have been reported thus making any conclusion on the exclusivity of these reactions diffi cult. Although the initial drug discovery strategies used enzymes recognizing protein substrates (E3s and isopeptidases) to develop new chemical inhibitors, nowadays all enzymes are considered as good candidates for drug development.",

The 20S core particles consist of four stacked heptameric ring structures that are themselves composed of two different types of subunits. The two outer rings are formed by seven alpha subunits (\u03b11-\u03b17) that allow the interaction with the 19S particle, while the inner rings are composed of seven beta subunits (\u03b21-\u03b27), three of which are responsible for the catalytic activity. The catalytic mechanism of these subunits is the same because they use the hydroxyl group of the N-terminal threonine of a mature \u03b2-subunit to perform the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of a peptide bond (Borissenko and Groll 2007 ; Kisselev and Goldberg 2001 ; Kisselev et al. 2012 ; Voges et al. 1999 ) . Each subunit reacts with specifi c substrates: \u03b21 subunit possesses peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH) activity that cleaves after acid residues, \u03b22 has trypsin-like activity that cleaves after basic residues and \u03b25 subunit shows chymotrypsin-like activity that cleaves after hydrophobic residues. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of these catalytic residues in yeast showed that the most drastic changes occurred when \u03b25 subunit is inactivated (Heinemeyer et al. 1997 ) .",

Peptide aldehydes such as MG-132 were used to develop analogues with enhanced potency, selectivity and stability. Surprisingly, several studies showed that proteasome inhibitors induced rapid and selective apoptosis in different cancer derived cell lines, leading to the idea that proteasome inhibitors could be drug candidates. This idea was confi rmed by the fact that the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib regressed tumour size of xenograft tumours and also decreased metastasis and blocked angiogenesis in patients with hematologic malignancies. Thus, Bortezomib was the fi rst proteasome inhibitor approved by the Food and drug Association of the United States (FDA). Since its approval in 2003, it became the frontline treatment for MM, it has been accepted as second line treatment of MCL and it has also been included in hundreds of on-going clinical trials. In addition to Bortezomib, Carfi lzomib, another proteasome inhibitor, has been approved for relapsed/refractory MM, and other proteasome inhibitors are in clinical and preclinical trials (Table 11 .1 ).

Unlike Bortezomib, these inhibitors reduce neuropathy. MLN2238 and its oral analogue MLN9708, are reversible inhibitors in phase III trials with stronger chymotrypsinlike activity inhibition in vivo and a faster dissociation rate, able to penetrate inside tissues (Kupperman et al. 2010 ) . The oral inhibitor CEP-18770 in phase I and II trials shows encouraging results for the treatment of haematologic and solid tumours (Piva et al. 2008 ). Epoxyketone peptides . These peptides are the most potent and specifi c proteasome inhibitors known. They form a morpholine adduct with the N-terminal threonine through a covalent and an irreversible bond (Groll et al. 2000 ) . Carfi lzomib ) and ONX -0912 (Chauhan et al. 2010 ) belong to this class of inhibitors. They show a high chemical stability causing a stronger inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity than Bortezomib (Huber and Groll 2012 ) , and overcome the problem of resistance to Bortezomib. Due to their higher specifi city, neurotoxicity is reduced (Molineaux 2012 ) but other side effects still persist (Fostier et al. 2012 ). Carfi lzomib is currently used for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and the orally bioavailable ONX-0912 is included in phase I and II trials where it has shown an improved therapeutic window. \u03b2lactones : Nonpeptidic inhibitors have also been developed to improve bioavailability. The compound derived from the marine microorganism Salinispora tropica , Marizomib , is a \u03b2-lactone inhibitor in phase I trials (Fenical et al. 2009 ). Its \u03b2-lactone group reacts with the catalytic threonines of the proteasome active site forming an acyl-ester adduct and a tetrahydrofuran ring that stabilizes the binding leading to a highly potent, selective and orally bioactive proteasome inhibitor. Contrary to epoxyketones and peptide boronic acids, Marizomib inhibits the three activities of the proteasome irreversibly, in a stronger (more than 90 %) and longer-lasting way (Miller et al. 2011 ) . The use of marizomib results in adverse effects such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting and dyspnea.",

These compounds could potentially be used in combination with Bortezomib to improve clinical outcomes. For example, Rapamicin and PR -39 are compounds that bind to the \u03b17 subunits, thereby producing a disruption in the interaction between 20S and 19S regulatory subunits that blocks the entry of the substrate (Gaczynska et al. 2003 ) . 5 -amino -8 -hydroxyquinoline also interacts with the \u03b1-subunits inside the proteolytic chamber; while being cytotoxic for myeloma and leukemia cells in vitro, it has also been shown to decrease tumour size in xenograft tumour growth in vivo (Li et al. 2010 ) , and overcomes resistance to Bortezomib in cultured cell lines.",

Although all mechanisms are not fully understood, it seems that they block the degradation of proapoptotic proteins and cell cycle regulators ( Fig. 11 .2 ). Among them, the tumor suppressors retinoblastome (Rb), p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), such as p21Cip1, p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 are degraded by the proteasome (Frankland-Searby and Bhaumik 2012 ; Rastogi 2013 ). Regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway are also controlled by the proteasome, including members of the Bcl-2 protein family (p53-target-genes) such as the proapoptotic proteins Bax, Bid, Noxa or Bad, and anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-XL and Bcl-2. Bortezomib treatment increases the expression of proapoptotic members such as Bax, Smac and Noxa while anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and IAPs are down-regulated, thus favoring apoptosis in tumor cells (Crawford and Nahta 2011 ) . The mechanism to induce apoptosis of each proteasome inhibitor seems to be different, thus some combinations result in synergies. For example, Carfi lzomib and Marizomib induce apoptosis mediated by caspase 8 and 9 better than Bortezomib, which is more dependent on Bax and Bak mitochondrion-mediated cell death (Kuhn et al. 2007 ; Miller et al. 2007 ) .",

ER stress leads to up-regulation of the endoribonuclease/ kinase IRE1a and the transcription factors ATF3&4 that will increase transcriptional activation of the pro-apoptotic Noxa (Armstrong et al. 2010 ) . Autophagy is also induced by ER stress as a resistance mechanism to escape cell death through the eIF2\u03b1 induced pathway, the activation of HDAC6, the IRE1-JNK pathway, by proteasomal stabilization of ATF4, the inhibition of mTOR, and by the reduced proteasomal degradation of LC3 (Belloni et al. 2010 ) . The activation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinases has been also reported after proteasome inhibition. This leads to 14-3-3 phosphorylation and consequently to cytochrome c release. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after the treatment with proteasome inhibitors results in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Fan et al. 2011 ) . ROS are responsible for DNA damage and proteasome plays a crucial role in DNA repair through the activation of p53 and other pathways.",

In phase II, 35 % of patients with refractory MM and 46.5 % of patients with pre-treated MCL responded to Bortezomib, therefore the FDA initially approved it for relapsed/refractory MM in 2003, and subsequently for relapsed/ refractory MCL in 2006 (Kane et al. 2006 ) . Moreover, survival rates of refractory MM patients using Bortezomib in phase III trials exceeded the response rates for patients treated with the previous drug choice Dexamethasone, resulting in Bortezomib being approved as a fi rst-line therapy in 2008 (Richardson et al. 2005 ) . However the refractory response to Bortezomib depends on the tumour cell type. Pancreatic, prostate and non-small lung tumour cells are sensitive while diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and some solid tumours such as sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioma only provide slight and short responses (Frankland-Searby and Bhaumik 2012 ).",

            "text": "Together with ubiquitin and SUMO, NEDD8 is among the most studied ubiquitin-like proteins (Fig. 11.1 ) . The best known physiological substrates of NEDDylation are the cullins, which are structurally related proteins that function as molecular scaffolds of the cullin-RING family of E3 ubiquitin-ligases (CRLs). CRLs consist of a core cullin protein bound to a RING fi nger protein (Rbx1/2) and an interchangeable substrate-binding adaptor protein (Bedford et al. 2011 ; Watson et al. 2011 ). Rbx1 and Rbx2 in conjunction with E2 enzymes UBC12 and UBE2F, respectively, promote NEDDylation of cullins (Huang et al. 2009 ). The archetypal CRLs, the so-called SCF ubiquitin ligases, contain CUL1, RBX1/2 and the adaptor protein Skp1. This core complex binds to one of the approximately 100 F-box proteins that are responsible for recruiting substrates (Bedford et al. 2011 ). Cullin NEDDylation has been shown to increase the ubiquitylation activity of CRLs by promoting conformational changes that increase the binding of Rbx1 to ubiquitin E2s, which results in a reduction of the distance between E2 and the substrate recognition component; it may also lead to displacement of the negative regulatory protein, CAND1, that binds to non-NEDDylated cullin (Watson et al. 2011 ) . Specifi cally, the CRLs have been established to control the degradation of proteins with important biological roles, including cell cycle progression (p27, cyclin E, c-Myc), tumour suppression (p53), DNA damage (CDT1), stress responses (NRF-2, HIF-1\u03b1), and signal transduction (I\u03baB\u03b1). In addition, other NEDD8-regulated substrates with key cancer-related functions are \u03b2-catenin, c-JUN, mTOR and MDM2. Interestingly, increasing evidence suggests that NEDD8-mediated protein turnover may be deregulated in malignant cells and could result in oncogenic transformation, disease progression, or impart a drug-resistant phenotype (Nawrocki et al. 2012 ) . For example, disruptions in the NEDD8 pathway lead breast cancer cells to acquire anti-estrogen resistance and expression of ER alpha (Fan et al. 2003 ). It has also been shown that increased NEDD8 conjugation appeared to be essential for the enhancement of proliferation in several types of human carcinoma cells (Chairatvit and Ngamkitidechakul 2007 ) .",

            "text": "Because many CRL substrates have tumour suppressor activity, preventing the degradation of these proteins could be an effective anticancer strategy that may also help to reduce toxicities resulting from global proteasomal inhibition (Nawrocki et al. 2012 ). MLN4924 , a potent and selective fi rst-in-class small molecule inhibitor developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, was reported as a specifi c inhibitor of protein NEDDylation through the inactivation of the heterodimer APPBP1 (NAE1) and UBA3 (UBE1C), also known as the NEDD8 activating enzyme NAE (Soucy et al. 2009 ; Wang et al. 2011 ) . MLN4924 is an adenosine sulphamate that forms a covalent adduct with NEDD8 when bound to the NAE active site and in this way inhibits the formation of UBC12-NEDD8 thioester. The MLN4924-NEDD8 adduct mimics the NEDD8-AMP in situ which is the fi rst intermediate in the NAE reaction cycle, but cannot be enzymatically processed further (Brownell et al. 2010 ; Nawrocki et al. 2012 ) . MLN4924 inhibits CRL activity and the stabilization of their substrates by blocking NAE, with subsequent implications in cancer cell growth and survival (Bedford et al. 2011 ) . In 2009, MLN4924 was fi rst reported as a potent growth suppressor agent against a variety of cancer cells lines derived from solid tumours and haematological malignancies in both in vitro and in vivo xenograft models (Soucy et al. 2009 ; Zhao et al. 2014 ) . During preclinical trials, tumour regression occurs after the action of different mechanisms depending on context and cell type. Induction of apoptosis is one of the reported effects mediated by MLN4924 in three different mechanisms mainly caused by the accumulation and stabilization of CRL substrates like: (1) CDT1, which trigger DNA re-replication and S phase arrest; (2) I\u03baB\u03b1, that blocks NF-\u03baB activation, and; (3) pro-apoptotic NOXA. In addition to apoptosis, MLN4924 also induces autophagy in a concentration-and time-dependent manner in multiple human cancer cell lines derived from carcinomas of breast, colon, liver, brain and cervix. Studies revealed that autophagy is mainly caused by inactivation of mTORC1, most likely mediated by accumulation of DEPTOR and HIF1\u03b1, followed by the activation of the HIF1-REDD1-TSC1 axis. Some studies have also shown that MLN4924 can induce irreversible senescence in multiple cancer cell lines in a p21-dependent manner. In SK-BR3 cells, p16 and p27 accumulation may also contribute to the MLN4924-induced senescence. Furthermore, MLN4924 has a potential sensitizer role in chemotherapy and radiation, involving the mechanistic accumulation of c-Jun, NOXA, CDT1, WEE1 or p21; it also affects the promotion of c-FLIP degradation, increasing the expression of Bcl-2-interacting killer (BIK), inactivating CRL3, as well as the suppression of FANCD2 monoubiquitylation and CHK1 phosphorylation, all of which results in a general increase in cellular sensitivity by enhancing DNA damage, oxidative stress, cell cycle arrest and fi nally apoptosis (Zhao et al. 2014 ) . Despite this promising optimal strategy to inhibit NAE pathway, recently it has been identifi ed that cancer cells can develop resistance to MLN4924 treatment. Resistance has been linked to heterozygous mutations in two areas of NAE\u03b2 (UBA3), the ATP binding pocket at Alanine 171 and at various residues within or close to the NEDD8-binding cleft. A point mutation in residue A171T reduced affi nity for both MLN4924 and ATP. Interestingly, such resistance has been effectively bypassed by using a compound with tighter binding properties for NAE. These fi ndings provide critical clinical aspects with respect to patient selection and consolidate efforts for the development of next-generation NAE inhibitors in order to overcome emergent mutations (Milhollen et al. 2012 ; Toth et al. 2012 ). In fact, by using a virtual screening approach, a natural product, 6,6\u2033-biapigenin, has been identifi ed and proposed as a second inhibitor of NAE (Leung et al. 2011 ) . In 2012, a cyclometallated rhodium (III) complex was reported as the fi rst metal complex to suppress the NEDDylation pathway via inhibition of NAE, which occupied the same binding pocket as MLN4924 (Zhong et al. 2012 ).",

Up to now, there are a total of seven Phase I/II clinical trials for MLN4924 in patients with leukaemia, lymphoma, melanoma and several solid tumours. These trials were mainly designed to assess the safety, discomforts and risks of the inhibitor; to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that can be given to patients; to describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects; to evaluate disease response, and to study MLN4924 in combination with other standard treatments. In general, patients received escalating doses of MLN4924 that was administrated via intravenous infusion on different daily schedules. The pharmacokinetics of MLN4924 were measured in serial blood samples, bone marrow aspirates (BMAs), skin punch biopsies, or fi ne-needle tumour biopsies collected following drug dosing. The samples were analysed to measure MLN4924-NEDD8 covalent adduct and the expression of CRL substrates, such as CDT1, NRF2, and phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1, as the biomarkers to indicate NAE inhibition in peripheral and tumour tissue (Zhao et al. 2014 ). The PK profi les were similar following dosing on different days, suggesting no apparent accumulation of MLN4924 in plasma with an estimated half-life of 5-15 h. In general, most clinical trials carried out thus far have concluded that MLN4924 is well tolerated in the majority of the dosing schedules studied, with evidence of target inhibition and antitumoural activity which supports continued investigation of MLN4924, both alone and in combination strategies as potential treatment for a variety of human cancers (Nawrocki et al. 2012 ; Zhao et al. 2014 ).",

USPs, OTUS, MJD and UCHs use an active site cysteine as a nucleophile to attack lysine-glycine isopeptide bonds within ubiquitylated proteins (Nijman et al. 2005 ) , whereas the fi fth class of DUBs contains a JAMM zinc metalloproteinase domain (Cope and Deshaies 2003 ) . DUBs are generally expressed as active enzymes, rather than inactive precursors. However, certain DUBs require ubiquitin binding to obtain their active conformation and prevent their uncontrolled proteolytic activity. Structural data revealed that ubiquitin-binding by DUBs is accompanied by active site rearrangements, which are necessary to induce their hydrolytic activity (Edelmann et al. 2009 ; Komander et al. 2009 ). DUB activity is also regulated through the binding of scaffold and adaptor proteins (Ventii and ",

USP1, one of the best-characterized DUBs, is a regulator of several important steps in the DNA damage response, mainly in Fanconi anaemia (FA), an hereditary disorder characterized by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, genomic instability and increased susceptibility to cancer (Li et al. 2002 ; Reyes-Turcu et al. 2009 ). USP1 is frequently overexpressed in tumours like cervical and gastric cancer, melanoma and sarcoma. Importantly, USP1 inhibitors act synergistically with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin to inhibit the proliferation of cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (Chen et al. 2011 ; Garcia-Santisteban et al. 2013 ) . One company, Hybrigenics, has developed a variety of different inhibitors of the USP family (Table 11 .3 ). For example, HBX41 -108 is a cyano-indenopyrazine derived small molecule compound which modulates the catalytic reaction of USP7 (Colland et al. 2009 ). USP7, also known as herpes virus-associated USP (HAUSP), is critical in cancer progression because of its destabilizing effect on the tumour suppressor p53 (Cheon and Baek 2006 ; Cummins and Vogelstein 2004 ) . However, USP7 can also modify other substrates such as claspin, FOXO4 and PTEN, suggesting that USP7 exerts both p53-dependent and -independent effects on the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis (Faustrup et al. 2009 ; Song et al. 2008 ; van der Horst et al. 2006 ). HBX41-108 treatments stabilize p53, activate transcription of p53-target genes without inducing genotoxic stress, and inhibit cancer cell growth. Another compound more recently developed by Hybrigenics, HBX19 -818 , is a second-generation of irreversible USP7 inhibitors; it is more specifi c than HBX41-108, and is capable of regulating USP7 substrates in cancer cells and recapitulating the USP7 knockdown phenotype (Reverdy et al. 2012 ) . Recently, an independent screen performed by Progenra also identifi ed compound P005091 , and analogues such as P045204 and P022077 , as USP7 inhibitors capable of inducing apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells resistant to both conventional and Bortezomib therapies (Chauhan et al. 2012 ) .",

The transcription factor p53 has been found mutated and/or deregulated in about half of all known cancers (Soussi and Beroud 2001 ) . In other cases, p53 remains functional but abnormally retained by overexpressed or mutated Mdm2, or its homologue MdmX/Mdm4. In 1996, the high-resolution crystal structure of Mdm2 with p53 was published (Kussie et al. 1996 ) and more recently, the MdmX/p53 crystal structure was resolved (Popowicz et al. 2008 ) . From these studies, non-peptide small molecules inhibitors have been designed to specifi cally target the hydrophobic pocket including three trivial amino acids (Phe19, Trp23 and Leu26) common to both Mdm2 and MdmX. Hoffmann-La Roche has been the fi rst company to develop one of the most potent Mdm2/p53 inhibitors, namely Nutlins. There are three generations of Nutlins (Nutlin-2; Nutlin-3a; RG-7112), with each generation aiming to improve the stability, affi nity and bio-availability of the inhibitor. After optimization of Nutlin-3a, RG-7112 was the fi rst Mdm2 inhibitor used in clinical trials to treat multiple human cancers . Other companies like Amgen developed a series of optimized compounds from the piperidinone class of compounds, obtaining AM -8553 that effi ciently inhibits tumour regression (Rew et al. 2012 ) . Since 2013, Amgen also developed the Mdm2 inhibitor, AMG -8735 , containing a morpholinone core with a signifi cant increase in both potency and metabolic stability compared to the piperidinone series. AMG-8735 emerges as an inhibitor with remarkable biochemical potency and pharmacokinetic properties (Gonzalez et al. 2014 ) (Table 11 .4 ).",

Based on Nutlin-3a (Roche), MI-219 (Ascenta) and TDP 222669 (Johnson&Johnson) structures, and using an NMR spectroscopy approach as an in silico compound-selection process, Priaxon AG developed two new classes of MDM2-inhibitors, PXN -527 and PXN -523 . These inhibitors have been tested in cellular cultures for inhibition of proliferation assays and are in preclinical trials (Cheok et al. 2011 ).",

            "text": "Even if the fi rst pieces of the puzzle of this ATP-dependent pathway were discovered more than 30 years ago, every year new components and regulatory mechanisms controlling this system are being described. Despite this brief didactic view of the UPS classifying enzymes, cofactors and substrates, the system is a lot more complex than presented here, and there is still a distinct lack of knowledge with respect to its overall organization. For instance, it is well known that under certain circumstances several modifying/de-modifying enzymes can act on distinct members of the ubiquitin family (Leidecker et al. 2012 ) , that proteasome subunits can be substrates of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules (Cui et al. 2014 ) , or that the proteasome can also drive proteolysis in the absence of protein modifi cation (Erales and Coffi no 2014 ) . Although most of the functional outcomes of recent fi ndings are not completely understood, it becomes clear that simply targeting a single enzymesubstrate pair will be diffi cult. However, this should not stop the use of these inhibitors to treat distinct pathologies, as has recently occurred with proteasome inhibitors that block multiple processes, since the discovery of drugs acting at different levels will also increase the chances of clinical success. Furthermore, the experience using combinations of different inhibitors is quite positive in cases where patients do not respond or are resistant to the current treatments. Although these combinatorial drug therapies might appear to be in contradiction with the initial aim of reducing undesirable side effects, it is possible that eventually they could be more effective. A compromise between effi cacy and cytotoxicity should be better defi ned by pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic studies. Finally, although we described the use of UPS inhibitors to treat some cancers, many of them have also been used to treat quite diverse diseases such as cardiac, immune and neurodegenerative disorders. The use of chemical inhibitors will contribute to a better understanding of the multiple cellular pathways regulated by the UPS. More importantly, these inhibitors will open up new perspectives for the treatment of various diseases, as has been the case for Bortezomib/Velcade (reviewed by Xolalpa et al. 2013 ) .",

All members of the ubiquitin family are generated through a high molecular weight precursor that has to be cleaved by specifi c proteases to generate the mature form of each modifi er. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin is mediated by a thiol-ester cascade of reactions involving at least three enzymes: an activating enzyme (AE) or E1; a conjugating enzyme (CE) or E2; and a ligase (LE) or E3. Ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMO or NEDD8 have their own set of enzymes. Demodifying enzymes such as DUBs, SUSPs or NEDP1 participate in a proofreading mechanism. Multiple chain types can be formed and the composition of the chains is essential to drive distinct functions, including proteolysis by the 26S proteasome",
