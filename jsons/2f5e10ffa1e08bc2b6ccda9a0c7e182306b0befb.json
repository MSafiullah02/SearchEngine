Microtubules are polar cytoskeletal filaments assembled from thousands of a \u2044 b tubulin heterodimers which are nucleated and organized by the perinuclear microtubule organizing centre (MTOC). Whereas kinesin and dynein motors use microtubules to move cargo throughout the cytoplasm, myosin motors interact with actin filaments [1] [2] [3] . Cytoplasmic dynein, frequently in cooperation with its cofactor dynactin, is a minus-end-directed microtubule associated motor responsible for retrograde transport (towards the nucleus) in eukaryotic cells [4] [5] [6] . This molecular motor is a large multiprotein complex of approximately 1.2 MDa that contains heavy chains, intermediate chains, light intermediate chains and light chains. Cytoplasmic dynein plays critical roles in a variety of eukaryotic cellular functions, including Golgi maintenance, nuclear migration, retrograde axonal transport and organelle positioning. In addition, cytoplasmic dynein is involved in numerous aspects of mitosis, such as spindle formation and organization, spindle orientation and mitotic checkpoint regulation [7, 8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 449, "end": 452, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 453, "end": 456, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 457, "end": 460, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 669, "end": 672, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 673, "end": 676, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 677, "end": 680, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1221, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1224, "text": "8]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Cargoes transported by dynein are linked to the motor via the tail, which consists of an N-terminal section of one or more heavy chains and a number of associated polypeptides [4, 5, 9, 10] . In general, the cytoplasmic dynein complex is resolved on SDS \u2044 polyacrylamide gels into subunit polypeptides of 530 (dynein heavy chains, DYNC1H), 74 (intermediate chains, DYNC1I), 53-59 (light intermediate chains, DYN-C1LI) and 10-14 kD (light chains). Cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain, with 4650 amino acids in humans, is among the largest polypeptides found in mammalian cells. Dimeric dyneins have a conserved tail structure in which the heavy chains dimerize through protein-protein interactions mediated by amino acids 300-1140 in the tail region ( Fig. 1) [11] . In addition, dynein heavy chain residues 446-701 and 649-800 are involved in intermediate chain and light intermediate chain binding respectively [11] . In the case of cytoplasmic dynein, intermediate chain is also able to form homodimers through interactions mediated by residues 151-250 [12] . Furthermore, in mammals, the 74 kDa cytoplasmic intermediate chain is homologous to the 67 kDa axonemal intermediate chain [13] . Three highly conserved light chains, also shared by axonemal dyneins, Tctex1 (DYNLT1), LC8 (DYNLL1) and roadblock (LC7 or DYNLRB1), bind to distinct regions of the intermediate chains, always as homodimers [14, 15] . DYNLL, a ubiquitous molecule, is the most highly conserved among light chains and, interestingly, in spite of lacking sequence homology displays a three-dimensional fold almost identical to that of DYNLT [16] [17] [18] . Both DYNLT and DYNLL form homodimers with a-helices flanking a shared central b-sheet, with the peptides from interacting partners lengthening the preformed b-strand. Indeed, according to the recently published crystal structures [19, 20] the two short, consecutive protein stretches of dynein intermediate chain that bind to DYNLT and DYNLL adopt an extended conformation (Fig. 1) . However, DYNLRB, also a ubiquitous component of cytoplasmic (Fig. 1) . In addition to these three light chain homodimers, there is also a dimer of DYNC1LI bound to the tail of cytoplasmic dyneins. Consistent with a role in cargo binding, DYNC1LI has been shown to bind to the core centrosomal protein pericentrin [22] . Thus, since dynein light and light intermediate chains appear to associate with cargo, it has been suggested that viruses might target these cellular components during infection processes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 179, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 180, "end": 182, "text": "5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 183, "end": 185, "text": "9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 186, "end": 189, "text": "10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 754, "end": 758, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 907, "end": 911, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1184, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1397, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1401, "text": "15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1612, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1613, "end": 1617, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1622, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1855, "end": 1859, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1863, "text": "20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2326, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 746, "end": 753, "text": "Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1998, "end": 2006, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2069, "end": 2077, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In human cells, the DYNLT1 and DYNLL1 homodimers bind to LGMAKITQVDF and KETQTP motifs respectively, both contiguously positioned in the intermediate chain sequence in which they adopt an extended conformation ( Fig. 1) [19, 20, 23, 24] .

However, numerous atomic coordinates are available for dynein light chain DYNLL1 in association with protein partners, and in all cases GIQVD or KXTQT motifs, or variations of them, are inserted into the DYNLL1 binding grove [24,25,27,108].

In fact, DYNLL1 binding affinity for a dimeric partner is significantly higher compared with the same partner as a monomer [19, 20] . This observation has led to the hypothesis that two identical polypeptide segments from a dimeric partner occupy both of the binding grooves of DYNLL1 and DYNLT1.

Since virus infection is frequently associated with cell apoptosis [115, 116] it has been suggested that viral polypeptides and Bim or Bmf compete for the binding of dynein light chains DYNLL1 and DYNLL2. Thus, binding of a viral polypeptide to DYNLL1 or DY-NLL2 might release Bim or Bmf which, in turn, would translocate to the mitochondria and initiate apoptosis. In this regard, transfection of Vero cells with ASFV p54 but not with a mutant protein that cannot bind to DYNLL1 triggers the release of microtubule-associated Bim and the concomitant caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation [117] . Hence, apoptosis induced by p54 results from the direct competition between Bim and p54 for their binding to DYNLL1, which suggests that virus-dynein interactions might be important not only in retrograde transport.

This is in agreement with the modeled solution structure of the complex of DYNLL1 with p54 of ASFV [26]. (B) Three hypotheses for the association of viral proteins to the dynein molecular motor. One viral polypeptide displaces a dynein intermediate chain from one binding side of the DYNLL homodimer (a). Two DYNLL homodimers associate to one dynein intermediate chain and to one viral polypeptide simultaneously (b).
