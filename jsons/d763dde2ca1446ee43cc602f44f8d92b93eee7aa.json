Coronaviruses are the causative agents of an estimated 30% of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans resulting in rhinitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [13] . While coronaviruses are often associated with mild disease (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a lineage B betacoronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a lineage C betacoronavirus, are associated with severe and potentially fatal respiratory infection [14, 15] . SARS-and MERS-CoV transcribe 12 and 9 subgenomic RNAs, respectively, which encode for the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins (Fig. 5 .1c) [14] . S, E, and M are all integrated into the hostderived lipid envelope, and S facilitates host cell attachment to angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors for SARS-CoV and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 receptors for MERS-CoV [16, 17] . The N protein encapsidates the viral genome to form the helical nucleocapsid. The viral replicase-transcriptase complex is made up of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) including a unique proofreading exoribonuclease that reduces the accumulation of genome mutations [12] .",

Certain H5 and H7 subtypes are highly pathogenic to domestic poultry when transmitted from wild birds, known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses [21] . HPAI viruses cause spillover infections in humans that may be severe or fatal. Examples include outbreaks of H5N1 and H7N9 HPAI viruses in Asia with high case fatality among humans, although limited human-tohuman transmission [22, 23] has been reported. HPAI virus adaptations might lead to sustained human-to-human transmission, and so poultry outbreaks are managed by flock depopulation [24] .

From 2017 to 2018, seasonal influenza caused approximately 49 million illnesses, 1 million hospitalizations, and 79,000 deaths in the United States alone [27] . When two or more influenza A viruses infect a common host, such as a bird or pig, individual gene segments may recombine to form a novel virus, known as antigenic shift. Influenza pandemics occur when novel viruses emerge into an immunologically na\u00efve population and become adapted for sustained human-to-human spread. The 1918 \"Spanish\" influenza pandemic was the most severe on record, resulting in an estimated 50 million deaths [28] . Less severe pandemics occurred in 1957, 1968, and 2009 .

Historically, measles infected an estimated 90% of children by age 5 years, resulting in approximately 2 million global deaths each year [10] . With the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963 and advances in global vaccination programs, measles cases and mortality have drastically declined (Fig. 5.2b ). By 2017, 85% of children worldwide had received at least one dose of the measles vaccine by age 1 year, and during 2000-2017, global measles mortality decreased by 80%, preventing an estimated 21 million deaths [31] . Of the 24 known measles genotypes, only five were detected in circulation during 2016-2017. Despite these gains, measles remains endemic in many regions of the world including Africa, Western Pacific, South East Asia, and Europe, and measles has resurged in previously low-incidence areas (e.g., regions within Europe and the Americas) with epidemics attributable to importation of cases and suboptimal immunization coverage [32] [33] [34] . An estimated 93% population immunity is required to prevent measles transmission within communities, a prerequisite for global elimination [35] .",

Influenza viruses bind to sugar moieties on the surface of airway epithelial cells where early viral replication, propagation, and shedding occur during an average 1-2 days of incubation period [55] [56] [57] . Peak viral replication typically occurs within 4 days of symptom onset and resolves within 7-10 days, lasting longer in children and immunocompromised hosts [58] [59] [60] . On average one person infects -one to two additional people; however, this reproductive number (R 0 ) varies by viral strain and social and environmental factors [61] . Viral infection impairs the airway mucosal barrier and disrupts the alveolar-capillary membrane contributing to leakage of fluid and inflammatory cells into the alveolar space which impairs gas exchange resulting in hypoxemia [62, 63] . Bacterial coinfection often complicates severe cases contributing to respiratory failure and death, with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species as predominant copathogens [64] . Seasonal influenza virus infection is largely limited to the respiratory tract; however, H5 and H7 HPAI viruses have a polybasic cleave site within the hemagglutinin allowing for replication outside of the respiratory tract [65, 66] . Infection with one strain of influenza does not confer complete immunity to other strains or subtypes [67] .",

Respiratory tract dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and alveolar macrophages are early targets of infection where during an average 8-to 12-day incubation period measles replicates and spreads to local lymphatics and respiratory epithelium and then disseminates in blood via infected lymphocytes to epithelial and endothelial cells in most organs [69] [70] [71] . The infectious period begins with fever onset and extends for several days after rash appears [72] . The estimated R 0 of measles is 9-18 dependent upon host susceptibility and social and environmental factors [73] . Measles infects and disrupts tissues throughout the body; however, severe disease is primarily due to lower respiratory tract and neurological complications [72] . Natural measles infection confers lifelong immunity, and passive transfer of maternal antibodies protects newborns during the early postnatal period [74] . Individuals who recover from measles infection are at increased risk of secondary infection [75, 76] .",

Epidemiologic data also support small droplet airborne transmission of SARS-CoV although the estimated R 0 of 0.86-1.83 argues against this being a predominate route of spread [77, 78] . SARS-CoV binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors on respiratory epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages resulting in diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure [79, 80] . SARS is a systemic infection with viremia detected in most cases affecting multiple cell types and organs [81, 82] . Acute kidney injury is multifactorial with evidence of acute tubule necrosis, vasculitis, and glomerular fibrosis, and central nervous system manifestations are at least in part attributable to direct infection of neurons resulting in edema and degeneration [83] . MERS-CoV is transmitted by large respiratory droplets and by contact with infected surfaces with an estimated R0 of <1 to >1 outside of versus within healthcare settings, respectively [84] . MERS-CoV binds dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on respiratory epithelial cells and pneumocytes where it undergoes productive replication during a 2-14 days incubation period [16] . Viral shedding from the lower respiratory tract may persist for weeks [85, 86] . Viremia, while not documented in all cases, is associated with severe disease and productive infection of DCs, and macrophages is thought to facilitate immune dysregulation [87, 88] . DPP4 is broadly expressed on cells outside of the lung; however, few autopsy data are available to define viral distribution [16, 89] .",

Risk factors for severe infection include age >65 years or <5 years; pregnancy; preexisting respiratory, cardiac, neurologic, or metabolic conditions; immunosuppression; and obesity. Progressive lethargy and shortness of breath, typically within 5 days of symptom onset, suggest development of lower respiratory tract complications which may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and death in severe cases [64] . Pneumonia due to influenza infection alone versus influenza and bacterial coinfection cannot be reliably distinguished by clinical or radiological grounds, and so a high index of suspicion is needed.

            "text": "As the smallpox disease course was related to the clinical presentation of disease, Rao proposed a clinical classification system [125] that was later adopted by the WHO in 1972 [51] . Ordinary type smallpox was the most common clinical type of smallpox. The incubation period was 7-19 days and was followed by fever onset (38.5-40.5 \u00b0C), headaches, backaches, vomiting, and diarrhea [51] . Lesions first appeared on mucous membranes (including the tongue, palate, and pharynx) ~1 day prior to macular rash development, where lesions began on the face followed by proximal regions of the extremities, the trunk, and the distal extremities. Lesion development followed a centrifugal dispersion pattern, typically most dense on the face, with papules appearing within 2 days of macular rash development. Papules became vesicular ~2-4 days later followed by a pustular stage (5-7 days postrash) that peaked ~10 days postrash. Pustule resolution quickly followed and was accompanied by lesion flattening, fluid reabsorption, hardening, and scab formation (14-21 days postrash). Rao proposed for ordinary type smallpox to be further subdivided based on the macular rash pattern [125] . These included discrete ordinarytype smallpox, characterized by discrete skin lesions; confluent ordinary-type smallpox, where pustular skin lesions were confluent on the face and extremities; and semiconfluent ordinary-type smallpox, where skin lesions were confluent on the face but disparate over the rest of the body. Modified-type smallpox, where lesions were less numerous than in ordinary-type smallpox, was primarily associated with vaccinated individuals and had an accelerated nonfatal disease course [125] . Flattype and hemorrhagic-type smallpox were the most lethal forms of the disease but were also very rare (~7% and 3% of patients, respectively) [51] . Flat-type smallpox had high CFRs in both unvaccinated and vaccinated patients (97% and 67%, respectively). Hemorrhagic-type smallpox was nearly 100% fatal in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and death normally came prior to macular rash development. The clinical symptoms of flat-type smallpox were more severe during the prodromal period and did not subside. Skin lesions were flat and often black or dark purple. Respiratory complications were common and patients were febrile throughout disease. Death typically occurred 8-12 days post-fever onset. Hemorrhagic-type smallpox could be divided into early and late hemorrhagic-type smallpox. The early form was characterized by hemorrhage (primarily subconjunctival) early in the disease course. Generalized erythema, petechiae, and ecchymosis within 2 days of fever and flat matter lesions formed across the entire body surface. Lesions turned purple by day 4 with death by day 6 as a result of cardiac and pulmonary complications. In the late form, hemorrhages occurred following rash development and death followed between 8 and 10 days post-fever onset.",

Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins are integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope and project from the viral surface. Matrix (M1) protein underlies the envelope, and M2 forms an ion channel within the envelope. Eight single-stranded RNA genome segments are coated with nucleoprotein (NP) and bound by the polymerase complex. Nuclear export protein (NEP) mediates export of viral RNA. Influenza has estimated reproductive number (R 0 ) between 1 and 2. Standard, droplet, and contract precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission. (b) Measles virus is pleomorphic in shape. Hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins are integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope, and matrix (M) protein underlies the envelope. The single-stranded RNA genome is coated with nucleoprotein (N) and bound by the polymerase complex. Measles has an estimate R 0 between 9 and 18. Standard, airborne, and contact precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission. (c) Coronaviruses are spherical in shape. Spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins are integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope. The single-stranded RNA genome is coated with nucleoprotein (N). SARS and MERS have an estimated R 0 of <1-2. Standard, airborne, and contact precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission. (d) Poxviruses are oval to brick shaped. The biconcave viral core contains double-stranded DNA and several proteins organized as a nucleosome and surrounded by a core membrane. Two proteinaceous lateral bodies flank the core, and a single lipid membrane surrounds the cell-associated form of the mature virion (MV). A second host-derived lipid envelope covers the extracellular virion (EV). Smallpox has an estimated R 0 between 4 and 6. Standard, airborne, and contact precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission of smallpox((continued)   for viral budding. Matrix (M1) protein underlies the host-derived lipid envelope providing structure, and M2 protein is an ion channel integrated into the envelope. Eight single-stranded RNA viral genome segments are coated with nucleoprotein (N) and bound by the polymerase complex, composed of basic polymerase 1 (PB1), PB2, and acidic polymerase (PA). Nuclear export protein (NEP) mediates trafficking of viral RNA segments and nonstructural protein (NS1) inhibits host antiviral responses. The virus can also express accessory proteins PB1-F2 and PA-x.",
