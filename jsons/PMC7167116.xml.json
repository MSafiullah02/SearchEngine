The lecture reminded students of the skills they bring with them in the event of an emergency. The opportunities available to join an organized response effort such as the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) are discussed. Additionally, the dean described the abilities that graduate dentists can utilize in an emergency situation; for example, if dentists can accurately administer an inferior alveolar nerve block injection in the recesses of the mouth, they can certainly \u201chit\u201d the large deltoid muscle in the arm to administer a smallpox vaccination with minimal training.\n4\n\n",

The approach taken to achieve this objective was to use an existing surge response public health mechanism. NYUCD has had a close relationship with the New York City Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) for several years, ever since NYUCD and the city conducted a simulated Point of Dispensing (POD) exercise together. The MRC developed by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) consists of a multidisciplinary group of volunteer health professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, dentists, nurses, mental health practitioners, and others, who can be mobilized rapidly during a public health emergency. The MRC/NYC works in partnership with professional associations, universities, and hospitals. As an example, a bioterrorist attack may require mass antibiotic/vaccination prophylaxis. To dispense antibiotics or vaccine to the public, Point\u2010of\u2010Dispensing clinics (PODs) would be set up. POD functions include medical evaluation, triage, vaccination or distribution of medication, and line management. Clinical/support roles are assigned to each professional based on his or her skills and licensure.\n5\n\n",

It is focused on the realization that the major decision to be made is whether we should evacuate the building or use the inherent protection of the structure to shelter in place.

Students could tailor the plan to a specific bioterrorist agent (for example, a dirty bomb, sarin gas, a biological weapon) or make it generic for either a natural or a man\u2010made disaster.
