The degree of spatial selectivity is especially noticeable in a place like Hong Kong, where the Special Administrative Region\u2019s (SAR) mountainous topography dictates that all development is concentrated tightly along the coastal fringes of Victoria Harbor, on reclaimed land, or in bedroom suburbs located in lowland areas of the New Territories (HKY 2001). It is this compactness that gives the city its distinctive skyline. While many people consider Hong Kong to be one of the world\u2019s most densely populated cities, in reality about three quarters of its 1,092 sq km landmass is undeveloped and almost 40% of it is gazetted as country park (AFCD 2004). Most of the undeveloped land can be found in the New Territories or on outlying islands.",

Ghost towns, decaying villages occupied by remnant populations, and abandoned farmland and aquaculture operations are now the norm in many areas.

It once had 5,000 residents and served as the supply station for other coastal communities. However, it began to decline in the 60s as water pollution, a decline in farming, and few opportunities for young people saw its population drift into the city or emigrate overseas. Today, perhaps as few as 100 mostly elderly people live there permanently. The island is a popular hiking and camping destination for Hong Kong residents. It is also a popular spot for charter tours that deposit upwards of 2,000 people on any given Sunday during the summer season for sightseeing and a seafood dinner.",

All were residents of the island and all were involved in tourism to some extent.

In addition, there is a risk of cultural bias, especially when one of the authors comes from a different ethnic and cultural background than the study participants. Each of the authors analyzed the data set independently and then they compared notes to ensure consistency and accuracy of interpretation. Subsequent interviews also gave residents the opportunity to clarify certain points and to augment their statements. The third point in the triangulation process was provided by secondary data sources. Importantly, as well, the stories told by participants were largely consistent, enabling cross-verification of ideas.

The Tanka and Hakka have historically been marginalized by the more dominant Cantonese. The Tanka are thought to be descended from the original inhabitants of Hong Kong Rodwell, 1992, Lee and DeStefano, 2002. They were traditionally nomadic fisher folk who spent their lives on their boats and rarely if ever went ashore. The influx of Punti people (the ancestors of the modern Cantonese) in the 1100s supplanted the Tanka and pushed them to the coastal margins. Stokes commented that the Tanka \u201ccontinued to make their living around the coasts. Now outnumbered and often scorned, they faded into Hong Kong\u2019s sea-hazed background (1995:30)\u201d.",

The coast became a desolate wasteland as it was turned into a military zone (Lee and DeStefano 2002). The order was rescinded in 1669, but because most of the evacuees had perished during their period of forced eviction, repopulation was slow and sporadic. In response the Manchu rulers invited people from outside the region to migrate and the Hakka, people who had moved from northern China some generations earlier, responded. The term Hakka is somewhat derogatory and literally means \u201cguest family,\u201d in reference to their outcast status in their adopted homeland of Southern China. According to Lee and DeStefano the Hakka were a \u201cpeople proud of their language and traditions [and] they did not assimilate themselves with the mainstream culture of Southern China. As such they were never quite welcomed by the majority Cantonese\u201d. As a result \u201cpartly to preserve their own culture, but mainly to protect themselves from violent acts of xenophobia, the Hakka tended to live away from mainstream populations on poorer lands\u201d (2002:53). The only land available to them was found on hillsides and other marginal areas leased from the Cantonese (Hung 1998), placing them in a socially inferior position economically indebted to the dominant cultural community (Dudgeon and Corlett 1994). Thus, the Hakka and Tanka inhabitants found themselves relegated to the geographical, social, and political margins, where they coexisted with some enmity with the dominant Cantonese population (Welsh 1997), continuing to speak their own dialects and practicing their own traditions. Many elderly Hakka and Tanka still speak their own dialects.",

These tours have been available for many years but grew in popularity during the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crisis when inbound tour operators began to target local residents as a means of generating cash flow during a time when international arrivals collapsed. Local tours are popular for two reasons. First, they provide access that is otherwise not available to remote areas. Car ownership rates are low (less than six cars per 100 residents, compared with more than 60 cars per 100 US residents). In jurisdictions where car ownership rates are higher, people will self-drive to these attractions, but in Hong Kong, tour operators fill the niche. Second, the HKSAR consists of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories which are connected to the China Mainland and some 235 offshore islands.
