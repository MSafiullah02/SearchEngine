FCoV is classified into types I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its spike protein [1], [2], [3]. Each of these types consists of two viruses: feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-causing FIP virus (FIPV) and non-FIP-causing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FIPV and FECV of the same type cannot be distinguished by their antigenicity or at the gene level, and differ only in their pathogenicity for cats. FIP is a fatal disease mainly causing immune complex vasculitis accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation.",

Intraperitoneal inoculation with FIPV induced more severe clinical signs in anti-FCoV antibody-positive kittens and kittens that received passive immunization with serum or purified IgG from antibody-positive cats compared to antibody-negative kittens [11], [12]. These results of experimental studies suggest that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection can be a serious obstacle to the prevention of FIP by vaccination. Potent cellular immunity was induced in FIPV-infected non-FIP cats [13], [14], [15], [16]. Cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in the prevention of FIP onset [10]. Thus, induction of the cellular immune response is essential for the vaccines against FIPV infection.",

The S protein exists as radially protruding trimers on the viral envelope, and can be structurally or functionally divided into two domains, namely the S1 and S2 domains, representing the N-terminal globular head and C-terminal membrane-bound stalk, respectively. The C-terminal S2 domain sequentially contains the pre-coil (PC) region, putative fusion peptide (FP), 4,3 hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR)1, inter-helical (IH) domain, HR2, and the cluster aromatic amino acid domain from the N-terminal, and is responsible for driving viral and target cell membrane fusion [18], [19]. The N-terminal S1 domain contains the receptor-binding epitope, neutralizing antibody-binding epitope, and ADE epitope [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. The S2 domain and N protein homologies between the type I FIPV KU-2 strain and type II FIPV 79-1146 strains are 60.7% and 91.0%, respectively [2], [3].",

In FIPV KU-2-infected non-FIP cats, the concentration of fIFN-\u03b3 in the supernatants of PBMCs cultured with six kinds of peptides (NP-4, -7, -8, -9, -14, and -22) and heat-inactivated FIPV KU-2 were significantly higher than that of PBMCs cultured with culture medium alone. In FIPV 79-1146-infected non-FIP cats, the fIFN-\u03b3 levels in the supernatants of PBMCs cultured with six kinds of peptides (NP-4, -7, -8, -9, -16, and -19) and heat-inactivated FIPV 79-1146 were significantly higher than that of PBMCs cultured with culture medium alone. In SPF cats, the concentration of fIFN-\u03b3 in the supernatant did not increase even if PBMCs cultured with either peptide. The reactivity of plasma collected from five FIPV KU-2-infected non-FIP cats, FIPV 79-1146-infected non-FIP cats, and three SPF cats against these peptides were examined (Fig. 3 right panel). The OD value of plasma from FIPV KU-2- and FIPV 79-1146-infected cats against three (NP-13, -21, and -22) and four kinds of peptides (NP-1, -13, -21, and -22), respectively, were significant higher than that of SPF cats.",

Similar observations were also made in SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from SARS-recovered donors rapidly produced IFN-\u03b3 following short-term stimulation with inactivated SARS-CoV or protein derived from SARS-CoV [27], [28], [30], [31], [32], [33], [43]. On the other hand, PBMCs derived from those with critical SARS or who died of SARS apparently could not produce IFN-\u03b3 against SARS-CoV antigen stimulation. It is suggested that memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, i.e., cellular immune response, participate in viral clearance in recovered SARS patients. Similarly, we found PBMCs obtained from FIPV-infected non-FIP cats specifically and significantly produced fIFN-\u03b3 against heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation, but not FIP cats (submitted). These results substantiate a previous finding that cellular immunity plays an important role in defense against FIPV infection [10], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Thus, induction of the cellular immune response is essential for the development of vaccines against FIPV infection. To detect the Th1 epitope, but not include ADE epitope, we synthesized eighty-one kinds of peptides derived from the S2 domain and the N protein of FIPV.",

Thus, we used PBMCs and plasma of type I FIPV-infected cats to detect Th1 and linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes in type I FIPV S2 domain. Similarly, PBMCs and plasma of type II FIPV-infected cats were used to identify Th1 and linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes in type II FIPV S2 domain. As described above, the Th1 epitope location in the S2 domain was different between FIPV KU-2 and FIPV 79-1146. On the other hand, the N protein homology between the type I FIPV KU-2 and type II FIPV 79-1146 strains is 91.0% [3]. NP-7, NP-8, and NP-9 specifically and significantly induced fIFN-\u03b3 production in PBMCs isolated from not only type I FIPV KU-2-infected but also type II FIPV 79-1146-infected non-FIP cats. Since NP-8 and NP-9 had a 12-amino acid overlap in their sequences, we investigated specific fIFN-\u03b3 production inductivities of NP-7 and NP-8 in PBMCs from FIPV 79-1146-infected cats. NP-7 and NP-8 showed potent fIFN-\u03b3 production inductivities in PBMCs from type II FIPV 79-1146-infected non-FIP cats but not for PBMCs from FIP and SPF cats. We found that the percentage of CD8+fIFN-\u03b3+ cells was markedly increased by NP-7, but not NP-8. Thus, stimulating PBMCs obtained from FIPV 79-1146-infected non-FIP cats with NP-7 increased fIFN-\u03b3 production particularly by FIPV-specific memory CD8+ T cells. This suggests that NP-7 includes Tc1 epitope. On the other hand, in PBMCs obtained from FIP cats, the percentage of CD8+fIFN-\u03b3+ cells was not increased by NP-7 stimulation. Similarly, it was reported that CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are markedly induced by SARS-CoV antigen stimulation in SARS-recovered donors, but not in those with critical SARS or who died of SARS [28], [44].",

SSp-1, which is a 9-mer peptide, present in the C-terminal S2 domain of S protein of SARS-CoV, is also known to induce strong CTLs activity, and is regarded as a candidate for vaccine development [26], [27], [28]. It was also reported that N protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which belongs to Coronaviridae, were a major target for the CTL memory response [46], [47]. Thus, NP-7 derived from N protein of FIPV KU-2 strain may be useful to elicit cellular immune response and be potential candidates for peptide-based vaccine development to prevent both type I and type II FIPV infection.",
