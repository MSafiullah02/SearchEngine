            "text": "Infrared imaging of the colliding-wind binary Apep has revealed a spectacular dust plume with complicated internal dynamics that challenges standard colliding-wind binary physics. Such challenges can be potentially resolved if a rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet star is located at the heart of the system, implicating Apep as a Galactic progenitor system to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. One of the difficulties in interpreting the dynamics of Apep is that the spectral composition of the stars in the system was unclear. Here we present visual to nearinfrared spectra that demonstrate that the central component of Apep is composed of two classical Wolf-Rayet stars of carbon-(WC8) and nitrogen-sequence (WN4-6b) subtypes. We argue that such an assignment represents the strongest case of a classical WR+WR binary system in the Milky Way. The terminal line-of-sight wind velocities of the WC8 and WN4-6b stars are measured to be 2100 \u00b1 200 and 3500 \u00b1 100 km s \u22121 , respectively. If the mass-loss rate of the two stars are typical for their spectral class, the momentum ratio of the colliding winds is expected to be \u2248 0.4. Since the expansion velocity of the dust plume is significantly smaller than either of the measured terminal velocities, we explore the suggestion that one of the Wolf-Rayet winds is anisotropic. We can recover a shock-compressed wind velocity consistent with the observed dust expansion velocity if the WC8 star produces a significantly slow equatorial wind with a velocity of \u2248530 km s \u22121 . Such slow wind speeds can be driven by near-critical rotation of a Wolf-Rayet star.",

The system was identified via infrared imaging to be likely a hierarchical triple, with a massive central CWB that dominates the high-energy, non-thermal, and infrared emission, and a third massive northern companion 0 \u2032\u2032 .7 away. The defining feature of Apep is a spectacular 12 \u2032\u2032 mid-infrared dust plume centred on the central binary. While the dust plume strongly resembles the pinwheel nebulae, additional intricate structures suggest that there are unknown processes sculpting the outflow from Apep. In particular, Callingham et al. (2019) found that the velocity of the gas in the central binary is a factor of six higher than the velocity derived from the observed proper motion of the dust pattern. As the dust and gas are expected to be coextensive, such a discrepancy between the speed derived from spectra and dust are inconsistent with the existing models of the dynamics of such colliding-wind systems. In standard CWB dust-producing models with isotropic stellar winds, newly formed dust assumes the velocity of the shock compressed stellar wind (Cant\u00f3 et al. 1996) , generally \u224880 percent of the fastest wind in the system (e.g. Marchenko et al. 2003) . The newly formed dust grains are then quickly accelerated to velocities closer to that of the stellar winds in a fraction of an orbital period (Pittard 2009; Williams et al. 2009a ). All other known Pinwheel nebulae display congruous spectroscopic and dust expansion speeds. Callingham et al. (2019) proposed that the contradiction between the measured dust and gas speeds in Apep can be resolved if the system is capable of launching extremely anisotropic winds, for example due to rapid rotation of the WR star in the central binary. This would imply that Apep is the first known Galactic analogue to long-duration gamma-ray burst progenitors, and a unique laboratory for astrophysics occurring otherwise only at cosmological distances. However, such a conclusion presents its own difficulties as there has not been any definitive observations of critically-rotating WR stars, despite such systems being favoured to exist by longduration gamma-ray burst models (Woosley & Heger 2006) .",

Callingham et al. (2019) interpreted the emission line weakness as dilution by additional continuum and, only partly, from warm dust emission. For example, the ratio of the He II \u03bb 2189/1163 nm lines is 0.16 for the central binary of Apep, while other WC7 stars show an average of \u22480.38 (Rosslowe & Crowther 2018) . The weakness of the He II emission lines for a WC7 star in the J-band, where dust emission is modest, is evidence of additional continuum from a companion star. Based on the abnormal strength of the He II to C IV lines for a WC7 star, Callingham et al. (2019) suggested that the most likely companion to the WC7 star was an early nitrogen-sequence (WN) 1 http://pacrowther.staff.shef.ac.uk/WRCat/ WR star. A WN4 or WN5 star was indicated to be the best candidate after comparison to template WN spectra (Crowther & Smith 1996) , mainly due to the absence of the N V line and relative weakness of the He I lines in the near-infrared spectrum.",

Based on standard binary evolutionary models, it should be rare to find both stars during such an ephemeral life stage at the same time due to single-star evolution. The (quasi-) chemically-homogeneous evolutionary channel is one process that has been suggested as capable of forming a binary composed of two classical WR stars (e.g. Martins et al. 2013; Marchant et al. 2016 ). In such an evolutionary channel, rapid rotation leads to a mixing timescale shorter than the nuclear timescale, allowing the stars to bypass the post-main-sequence expansion as they would not maintain a massive hydrogen-rich envelope (Maeder 1987; Langer 1992) . Smaller radii post-main-sequence implies a binary system could evolve without mass-transfer, providing an opportunity for two massive stars to enter a similar lateevolutionary stage together (Song et al. 2016) . The rapid rotation required in the model could be sustained via tidal interactions in close binaries (de Mink et al. 2009; Mandel & de Mink 2016) but it is unclear how rapid rotation would be maintained in wider binaries.",

In addition, if the central binary of Apep is a WN/C+O system, all emission lines would be formed in a single wind, whereas one might expect differences in wind velocities for lines arising in each of the WN and WC components (Willis 1982) . Distinction between these two scenarios will allow us to: (1) establish the wind-momentum of the system and wind speeds of the stars in the central binary, (2) calculate the total kinetic power dissipated in the wind collision that is feeding the X-ray and non-thermal radio emission, (3) probe the geometry of the wind-collision region, which in turn shapes the larger dust plume, and; (4) derive an accurate distance to the system based on spectral class luminosities. Additionally, confident identification of the components of the central binary of Apep will facilitate plan-ning and interpretation of high resolution optical aperture-masking and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observations. With these goals in mind, we observed Apep with the X-SHOOTER spectrograph (Vernet et al. 2011 ) on the European Southern Observatorys (ESO's) Very Large Telescope (VLT). The X-SHOOTER observations and the data reduction process performed are provided in Section 2. Section 3 details the spectral line and type classification of the central binary and third massive member of the Apep system. The implications of the X-SHOOTER spectra on our understanding of the Apep system is discussed in Section 4, and our study is summarised in Section 5.",

In comparison, prominent features in WC and WN/C stars are the C III \u03bb 674 nm, C IV \u03bb 706.5 nm, and C III \u03bb 850 nm lines (Crowther 2007) . As shown in Figure 1 , the C III \u03bb 674 nm line is present, while the C IV \u03bb 706.5 nm line is blended with N IV \u03bb 711.6 nm, and the C III \u03bb 850 nm is relatively weak. Several line profiles are extremely broad, suggesting an extremely high wind velocity for at least one WR star in Apep (Eenens & Williams 1994) . In order to break the apparent degeneracy in spectral morphology between WN/C or WN+WC components, a clear expectation of the single WN/C star scenario is that the emission lines from ions of high ionisation energy form in the inner, accelerating wind, while lower ionisation lies form in the outer wind moving close to terminal velocity (Willis 1982; Hillier 1989) . Therefore, the velocities of the different ions need to be physically consistent if the wind lines arise from a single star. For example, He II lines form at a smaller radii than C III lines, implying we should expect the fullwidth half-maximum (FWHM) of He II lines to be smaller than C III lines. Indeed, we find from a large sample of single WC4-9 stars the trend: FWHM(He II 1012)/FWHM(C III 971) = 0.75\u00b10.05 (Rosslowe & Crowther 2018) , as shown in Figure 4 . In contrast, Apep is a significant outlier in this population with a FWHM(He II 1012)/FWHM(C III 971) = 1.30 \u00b1 0.05. We also directly demonstrate in Figure 5 that the FWHM of the He II \u03bb 1012 nm line exceeds that of the C III \u03bb 971 nm line in Doppler space. We interpret such an unusual ratio as implying that these lines do not arise in a single WN/C star. Therefore, we suggest that the central binary of Apep is composed of a double WR system. Such an assignment is further supported by the spectra presented in Figure 6 , which demonstrates that the identical combination of the spectra of a WC7 (WR 90; Dessart et al. 2000; Rosslowe & Crowther 2018 ) and a WN4b (WR 6; Hamann et al. 1995; Howarth & Schmutz 1992) star displays a close qualitative agreement to the visual-red spectra of the central binary of Apep, as provided in Figure 1 and 2. The morphological agreement of the spectra produced by assuming an identical contribution of WR 90 and WR 6 to the continuum also indicates that neither WR star in central binary of Apep strongly dominates the visual-red spectra, and hot dust is diluting the near-infrared emission lines.",

            "text": "The conclusion of a WC+WN system assumes that the reported line ratios are clean proxies for the ion stratification in the stellar winds. We do note that there are several known mechanisms that could distort the line ratios presented. For example, the profile of the C III lines are susceptible to the geometry and dynamics of the wind collision region in a CWB (Luehrs 1997) . However, an excess in the C III lines for CWBs has only been observed in systems with short (days to months) periods (e.g. Hill et al. 2000 ; Bartzakos et al. 2001) . In comparison, the central binary of Apep has an orbital period of \u2248100 yr (Callingham et al. 2019 ) and is not actively producing dust (Han et al. subm) . The long period of Apep also implies the wind-collision region is unlikely to be disrupting the ionisation stratification of the stellar winds. Furthermore, the relatively low inclination of the Apep system argues against a significant amount of compressed wind velocity in our line of sight. If the wind-collision region was contributing significantly to the C III lines, we would expect to observe prominent sub-peak structure to be evident in the C III \u03bb 569.6 nm line. Such sub-peak structure would likely be at relatively low radial-velocity given the geometry of the system, and only strong when dust formation is vigorous. Since we conclude that the central binary is likely composed of two classical WR stars, we can use the carbon and nitrogen line diagnostics to pin down their spectral subtypes. The C III \u03bb 569.6 nm and C IV \u03bb \u03bb 580.1-1.2 nm lines are weak or absent in early WN stars. Therefore, we can classify the WC component from their relative strengths. As shown in Figure 2 , both lines are detected and have an equivalent width ratio of C III \u03bb 569.6 nm/C IV \u03bb \u03bb 580.1-1.2 nm \u2248 1.8, establishing the WC component as a WC8 star (Crowther et al. 1998 ). The C III \u03bb 1191 nm/C IV \u03bb 1199 nm ratio of \u22483.0 (Callingham et al. 2019) argues against a WC9 classification.",

Such strengths are relatively modest with respect to other WC8 stars. For example, WR 60 (HD 121194) has a similar FWHM to the WC8 component of Apep but has the equivalent widths of the C III \u03bb 569.6 nm and C IV \u03bb \u03bb 580.1-1.2 nm lines a factor of three times larger (Smith et al. 1990 ). Therefore, it is likely the WC8 star has unusually weak lines to allow the WN4-6b star to contribute significantly more than expected to the visible continuum flux. We note that the weak line abnormality for the WC8 star can also suggest an additional continuum source, as hot dust will not be prominent at visible wavelengths. However, the internal dynamics and smooth pinwheel dust pattern of Apep does not support a close third member in the central component.",

The second terminal wind velocity of v \u221e,WC = 2100 \u00b1 200 km s \u22121 is derived from the full-width at zero-intensity (FWZI) of the C III \u03bb 569.6 nm line presented in Figure 2 .

However, one significant problem with the CWB model thus far presented is that a momentum ratio of 0.4 predicts that the dust should inherit a shock-compressed velocity of \u22482500 km s \u22121 (from Eqn. 29 of Cant\u00f3 et al. 1996) , significantly higher than the observed dust expansion velocity of \u2248600 km s \u22121 (Callingham et al. 2019) . The calculations performed above are predicated on the collision of two non-accelerating hypersonic spherical winds with the measured line-of-sight velocities, and that the postshock fluid is well mixed across the contact discontinuity separating the two radiative shocks. In contrast, Apep has been hypothesised to contain a dense, slow wind that emerges from the equator of one of the WR stars (Callingham et al. 2019) . While the orbital period of the central binary is \u223c100 yr (Han et al. submitted) , it is possible that the slow wind is present in the wind collision region, while the faster wind with one of the measured terminal velocities is escaping from the pole of that same WR star.",

However, we can not completely exclude the possibility that the northern companion is a rare chance line-ofsight alignment. If the northern companion is a chance alignment, such a configuration would help explain why there is no local heating of the dust near the star and the lack of a non-thermal source where the wind of the central binary impacts the northern companion's wind. The nearer distance of \u223c1.7 kpc is favoured photometrically if the northern companion is not associated with the central WR binary.

The terminal wind velocity of the WC8 and WN4-6b stars are measured to be 2100 \u00b1 200 and 3500 \u00b1 100 km s \u22121 , respectively. If the mass-loss rates of the two WR stars are typical for their spectral class, the momentum ratio of the colliding wind is \u223c 0.4. Such a large momentum ratio predicts a shock half-opening angle of \u224873 \u2022 , \u224813 \u2022 larger than that obtained by fitting models to the geometry of the spiral dust plume. However, this model does not fit with the observed proper motions of the dust plume. We can recover the momentum ratio and the measured slow dust expansion velocity if the mass-loss rate of both WR stars is assumed to be the identical but the wind from the WC8 star in the wind collision region has a velocity of \u2248530 km s \u22121 . The shock opening angle, and the presence of the slow wind is testable by way of radio VLBI observations (Marcote et al. subm) . Finally, we show that the similar extinction measurements for the central binary and northern companion suggest a physical association, with the entire massive triple-system lying at 2.0 +0.4 \u22120.3 kpc.",

The central binary of Apep is shown as a black star, and the uncertainties derived from Gaussian fits to the respective emission lines are approximately the size of the symbol. The red line is the best fit to the literature data for the WC stars: FWHM(He II 1012) = (0.75 \u00b1 0.05)FWHM(C III 971)\u2212(120 \u00b1 70) km s \u22121 . The shaded region represents the 3-\u03c3 uncertainty around this fit. The median uncertainty of the literature FWHM measurements is shown by the gray errorbars above the legend. The two WN/C stars offset from the trend are likely outliers due to abnormal chemical abundances, and do not exceed a 1:1 FWHM ratio for the two lines.",
