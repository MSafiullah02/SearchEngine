            "text": "Platelet production starts with the complex bone marrow hematopoietic differentiation pathway known as megakaryopoieis.4 Pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells commit to differentiation as either a common lymphoid progenitor or common myeloid progenitor (CMP). The CMP then commits to another level of differentiation into either the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor or the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP). The signals that cue the stages of commitment are as yet only beginning to be understood. GATA-1, a 50-kd zinc finger DNA-binding protein encoded by an X-linked gene, acts in concert with another protein, friend of GATA (FOG), which affects transcription without binding to DNA.5, 6 Cells committed to the megakaryocytic lineage and thrombopoiesis, rather than erythropoiesis, begin to express CD41 and CD61 (integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 or \u03b1IIbIIIa), CD42 (glycoprotein [GP]Ib), and GPV.7, 8 Once committed, each primitive megakaryocyte (MK) progenitor or burst-forming unit (BFU-MK), a large complex with satellite collections of MKs, is capable, under the influence of thrombopoietin (TPO) and interleukin (IL)-3 and Steel factor, of producing up to several hundred mature MKs. Another form of mature progenitor, the colony-forming unit (CFU-MK) produces colonies that consist of 3 to 50 MKs responsive to TPO, although approximately 25% require both TPO and IL-3 to generate platelets.9, 10 Each MK produces up to about 4,000 platelets before undergoing apoptosis. A normal adult human produces about 1011 platelets daily, and this rate can be increased 20-fold with exogenous TPO.4\n",

The stages of thrombopoiesis include regulation of transcription, MK development, endomitotic spindling of the MK nucleus, cytoplasmic maturation, formation of active projections (protoplatelets) from the MK cytoplasm, extrusion of these protoplatelets from the bone marrow stroma into the circulation, and, lastly, separation and maturation into individual platelets.18\n",

Peptides are expressed on the cell surface in the context of MHCII and costimulatory help for presentation to T cells, amplifying the initial immune response and possibly generating cryptic epitopes from other platelet glycoproteins, which spreads the immune response to involve multiple platelet antigens.24 ITP is characterized by reducing T-regulatory cells (reviewed in Stasi et al25) and Thy-2 cytokines,26 leading to a Thy1/Thy0 profile (reviewed in Ho-Yen et al27) and upregulation of costimulatory molecules28, 29 that facilitates proliferation of antigen-derived CD4-positive T cells and T-cell/B-cell cooperation to generate isotype-switched, high-affinity antibodies.30 There is emerging evidence that cytotoxic T cells are increased in the bone marrow31 and may contribute to platelet destruction32, 33 or impaired production (see below). The importance of platelet destruction in the periphery is affirmed by the fact that two thirds of patients develop and maintain remission after splenectomy, which curtails phagocytosis, but may also reduce antibody production over time. Likewise, most first- and second-line medical therapies for ITP are believed to work by impeding platelet destruction.2, 3\n",

However, approximately 20% to 25% of patients with SLE develop moderate-severe thrombocytopenia, which can be readily managed if immune-mediated or can be a marker of severe systemic disease.42 The pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia is multifactorial and includes: (1) antiplatelet glycoprotein antibodies as found in ITP; (2) immune complexes of diverse composition; (3) antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) (see below); (4) vasculitis; (5) thrombotic microangiopathy; (6) hemophagocytosis; (7) autoantibodies to the c-Mpl receptor43 and MK; and (8) bone marrow stromal alterations44 not characteristic of ITP.45 Therefore, a thorough clinical and laboratory assessment is often required before a diagnosis of secondary immune thrombocytopenia should be entertained. It is also important to limit the use of corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents in these often heavily treated patients. Splenectomy may provide only transient benefit and is reserved for patients in whom severe thrombocytopenia is the predominant reason for treatment.46\n",

However, some, but not all, studies suggest such patients may be at risk for thrombosis once they do respond.47, 48, 49, 50, 51 The diagnosis is complicated by the fact that approximately 25% of patients with APS45 develop mild-moderate thrombocytopenia. Severe thrombocytopenia in APS correlates more closely with the presence of antiplatelet glycoprotein antibodies than either APLA or clinical manifestations.52, 53, 54, 55, 56 However, platelets do express receptors for \u03b22GPI,57, 58, 59 which in theory could lead to APLA-mediated platelet activation alone or in association with other agonists,60 and there are anecdotal reports of response to aspirin, perhaps by inhibiting coagulation-mediated platelet consumption.61, 62, 63\n",

Hemolysis may precede or follow the onset of thrombocytopenia and is typically more refractory to intervention, and the two cytopenias are often dyssynchronous in their manifestations. The response rates to ITP-directed therapy, including splenectomy, are less than in primary disease. More than 50% of children and some adults with ES have a clinical and pathological presentation that overlaps with the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). ALPS is characterized by the chronic accumulation of nonmalignant lymphocytes leading to lymphadenopathy and (hepato)splenomegaly, >1% CD3+, CD4\u2212, CD8\u2212 (double-negative) T cells, impaired Fas-receptor/ligand mediated apoptosis in vitro due to mutations in Fas (CD95/Apo-1), or less commonly Fas ligand (Fas-L), caspase-8 or -10. Immune thrombocytopenia develops in about 20% of patients71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76 and may respond relatively poorly to ITP therapies, although recent experience with rituximab and mycophenylate have been encouraging. Immune thrombocytopenia and ES also occur in approximately 10% to 15% of patients with common variable immune deficiency (CVID) and hypogammaglobulinemia. The onset of immune thrombocytopenia is typically in the third decade, although onsets from childhood to old age have been reported and typically precede the diagnosis of CVID by several years. The diagnosis should be sought in any patient with recurrent infection, as immunosuppressive therapy poses some risk and replacement with immune globulin is indicated.",

The typical patient is a multiparous or multitransfused female who presents with hemorrhage and the sudden onset of profound thrombocytopenia a mean of 7 days after transfusion of a blood product containing platelet antigens. The disease occurs primarily among the approximately 1% of Caucasians who are homozygous for HPA1b allele on GPIIIa, although other specificities have been reported. Patients not only develop anti-HPA1a antibodies, but also self-reactive antibodies of undetermined specificity, presumably as a result of epitope spread. Remarkably, PTP is not seen in women with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia due to anti-HPA1a antibodies. Patients are at a high risk of bleeding and the clinical course is often protracted without therapy. IVIG is the standard of care. The utility of preventing subsequent exposure to the inciting antigen using washed HPA1b blood products is logical but unproven.",

The performance characteristics may be improved using newer assays that measure only IgG antibodies and using higher diagnostic cut-off optical density measurements, with little loss of negative predictive value.183 Assays based on platelet activation are more specific but less sensitive and the results are not routinely available in real time. Once the diagnosis is strongly suspected (moderate\u2013high pretest probability), exposure to all forms of heparin (including flushes, heparin-bonded catheters, etc) must be discontinued and anticoagulation begun with either a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as hirudin or argatroban or an anti-Xa agent such as danaparoid, where available.184 Therapy reduces new thromboembolic events by approximately two thirds, but mortality rates and amputations due to preexisting clots are not affected. Therapy is continued until thrombocytopenia resolves and is overlapped with coumadin at a therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) for 3 to 5 days.
