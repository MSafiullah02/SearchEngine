During the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, PCR not only offered a rapid way to diagnose SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, but also made the molecular analysis of its genomic sequence possible. Sequence variations were observed in the SAR-CoV obtained from different patients in this epidemic. These unique viral genetic signatures can be applied as a powerful molecular tool in tracing the route of transmission and in studying the genome evolution of SARS-CoV. To extract this wealth of information from the limited primary clinical specimens of SARS patients, we were presented with the challenge of efficiently amplifying fragments of the SARS-CoV genome for analysis. In this chapter, we will discuss how we managed to accomplish this task with our optimized protocols on reversetranscription, nested PCR amplification, and DNA cycle sequencing.

For RNA extraction, carrier poly(A) RNA is added to the lysis buffer to increase the yield. Because the PCR primers are specific to the SARS-CoV genome, the subsequent amplification would not be affected. However, if one wants to perform 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3' RACE) or similar cloning operation that depends on oligo(dT) priming of poly(A) tail of the viral RNA, then the carrier poly(A) RNA should be avoided. Yields of viral RNA should be determined by quantitative RT-PCR, because spectrophotometric determination is prone to error as a result of low RNA quantity and interference by the carrier poly(A) RNA, which contributes to most of the RNA present. 4. A prolonged denaturation step is used to remove secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV genome that impede reverse-transcription. The use of random hexamer ensures an even representation of the whole RNA genome and allows more sequence information to be obtained from a limited amount of viral RNA. 5. We recommend the use of a reverse transcriptase with increased thermal stability, which facilitates reverse-transcription at a higher temperature (55\u00b0C) than normal (42\u00b0C). This unfolds some of the secondary RNA structures, and thus produces longer cDNA at higher yields. 6. We recommend the simultaneous use of two different DNA polymerases in the PCR amplification. For example, the cDNA polymerase mix that we use contains KlenTaq-1 DNA polymerase, and a second DNA polymerase with 3' to 5' proofreading activity. The inclusion of a minor amount of a proofreading polymerase results in an error rate that is significantly lower than that for Taq alone (18). This advantage is obvious when one is concerned about genomic sequence variations between different viral strains. The use of a two-polymerase system also increases the efficiency and yield, and hence the sensitivity, which is important when the viral titer is suboptimal. 7. The carryover of unused PCR primers into the sequencing reaction would lead to poor sequencing results. Like the sequencing primers, these unused PCR primers would also bind nonspecifically to the sequencing template in the cycle sequencing reaction, and, hence, generate noisy sequencing traces overshadowing the intended traces. Purification of the PCR products is, thus, usually recommended prior to their use as sequencing templates. However, these methods are laborintensive and pose extra contamination risk, as they involve additional steps of opening and handling PCR products. Notably, we have suggested an optimized PCR protocol for direct sequencing of PCR products without PCR product purification. With the low PCR primer concentrations and the optimal number of cycles, most of the PCR primers are consumed at the end of the PCR. Furthermore, a nested sequencing primer selectively extends the specific PCR product in the cycle sequencing reaction. This would suppress any nonspecific PCR product from extension. The combined effect is a neat sequencing trace. 8. The amount of PCR product used for the sequencing reaction must be optimized carefully with different sequencing systems. Although more PCR product input usually gives higher signal intensities, it may also give shorter read lengths and oversaturated signals. 9 . The PCR primers target 50 700-bp amplicons that overlap with each other along the SARS-CoV genome. The sequencing primers are designed in such a way that any sequence masked over by the PCR primer binding sites and the sequencing primer peak on one amplicon are reliably backed up by the homologous sequence in the overlapping amplicon. 10. We advocate scrutinizing efforts in validating any genomic sequence variation by resequencing regions with different combination of primers and sequencing chemistry. Because variation seen in a single viral isolate could potentially be a result of sequencing artifacts, we consider only the genomic sequence variations that are shared by at least two SARS-CoV isolates.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3260, "end": 3261, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Notes"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Random hexamers (Applied Biosystems", "authors": [], "year": null, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "5X First-strand synthesis buffer: 250 mM Tris-HCl", "authors": [], "year": null, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "PCR Amplification 1.
