It has been known that SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) is responsible for SARS infection [1], [2], [3], [4], and further research showed that SARS_CoV belongs to one member of the Coronaviridae and is moderately related to the other known coronaviruses [5]. SARS_CoV has 11 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 23 putative proteins including four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and small envelope (E) proteins [5], [6]. The N protein of SARS_CoV (SARS_N) is a highly basic structural protein localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus of Trichoplusia ni BT1 Tn 5B1-4 cells [7]. Previous studies have indicated that the N proteins of other coronaviruses are extensively phosphorylated and associated with viral RNA to form a helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that comprises the viral core structure [8]. Recently, we discovered the fact that SARS_N tightly binds to human cyclophilin A, which might provide a new hint in understanding the possible SARS_CoV infection pathway against human cell [9].",

It was reported that the nucleocapsid protein of MHV (MHV_N) binds to the tandemly repeated sequence (UCYAAC) of the viral genome according to the SRXX repeated region (aa 177\u2013231) [10]. On the other hand, the genome sequence analysis for SARS_CoV has revealed that the transcription-regulating sequences at 5\u2032 end of each gene involve such partially conserved core sequence [5]. Structurally, SARS_N owns the SRXX repeated region that shares high similarity with that of MHV_N protein according to the sequence analysis. Therefore, SARS_N is predicted to interact with the viral RNA and be involved in the mRNA synthesis and transcription of SARS_CoV.",

            "text": "In human cells, it has been discovered that there are more than 20 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), and hnRNP A1 is the best-characterized protein that is most likely related to pre-mRNA splicing and transport of cellular RNAs [11]. Research has indicated that hnRNP A1 behaves as a global regulator of alternative pre-mRNA splicing by antagonizing the activities of several serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SR protein), thus resulting in the activation of alternative distal 5\u2032 splicing sites and skipping of optional exons [12]. In structure, hnRNP A1 contains two RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and a glycine-rich domain that is responsible for protein\u2013protein interaction. hnRNP A1 selectively interacts through its gly-rich domain with different RNA-binding proteins, especially some splicing factors (SR proteins) [13], [14]. It was proved that hnRNP A1 was involved in MHV RNA replication and transcription, certainly regulating RNA synthesis of a cytoplasmic virus [11]. A recently published paper demonstrated that the nucleocapsid protein of MHV could interact with hnRNP A1 [15]. Since SARS_N is able to bind to RNA [16] and also shares some homology with MHV_N, we think that during the SARS_CoV life cycle SARS_N might also possibly interact with human hnRNP A1 for mRNA synthesis and mature mRNA transporting and transcription.",

The results indicated that SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction involves the SR-rich fragment (aa 161\u2013210) of SARS_N and the Gly-rich domain (aa 203\u2013320) of hnRNP A1, which thereby suggests that both SARS_N and human hnRNP A1 proteins are possibly within the SARS_CoV replication/transcription complex, and their interaction might function in the regulation of SARS_CoV RNA synthesis similar to the MHV_N case. In addition, the fact that there is only one hnRNP A1-binding domain for SARS_N has suggested that SARS_N protein binds to hnRNP A1 in SARS_CoV taking a different mode in comparison with MHV_N.",

During the assay, SARS_N protein was immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip as ligand in 2000 RU according to the standard amine-coupling wizard. The control flow cell was activated then blocked directly without immobilizing any protein to eliminate non-specific interaction between hnRNP A1 and the sensor chip surface. The purified human hnRNP A1 protein was prepared in a series of concentrations as analyte then injected into Biacore 3000. The binding level (measured in RU) of human hnRNP A1 to the immobilized SARS_N rose and reached saturation with the increasing concentration (Fig. 2\nA), which demonstrated again that human hnRNP A1 protein can directly bind to SARS_N in vitro. The association of SARS_N with hnRNP A1 could be described in a simple equilibrium: A+B\u21d4AB. The kinetic parameters (the equilibrium dissociation constant, K\nD; association rate constant, k\non; and dissociation rate constant, k\noff) of the SARS_N/hnRNP A1 protein\u2013protein interaction were determined by the 1:1 Langmuir binding model.

After 96-h growth in high stringency nutrition medium (SD-LTH + 10 mM 3-AT) at 30 \u00b0C with shaking, 300 \u03bcl cells were transferred into the 96-well microplate. The growth curves of these cells were then evaluated by measuring their absorbance at 595 nm in the 96-well microplate. As indicated in Fig. 3B, \u0394N1 (aa 81\u2013422) and \u0394N2 (aa 161\u2013422) showed viability compared to the empty control, thus suggesting that these two segments of SARS_N protein have binding affinities to human hnRNP A1. It is noted that deletion of the fragment from aa 1 to 211 of SARS_N resulted in the loss of its binding activity to human hnRNP A1 as indicated by the fact that no viability was detected for \u0394N3 (aa 211\u2013422), \u0394N4 (aa 291\u2013422) and \u0394N5 (aa 211\u2013350). This therefore suggested that the interacting fragment of SARS_N protein involved in the SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction is most probably within the segment of aa 1\u2013211. In addition, it is found that the growths of both \u0394N1 (aa 81\u2013422) and \u0394N2 (aa 161\u2013422) are close to each other but a little less than that of the full-length N, it seems that the N terminal 80 amino acid residues of SARS_N might be involved in SARS_N/hnRNP A1 interaction. To validate this possibility, we made two truncated fragments for SARS_N, \u0394N2\u2032 (aa 1\u2013160) and \u0394N3\u2032 (aa 1\u2013210). As indicated in Fig. 3B, \u0394N2\u2032 had no binding affinity to human hnRNP A1, while \u0394N3\u2032 could bind to human hnRNP A1, which thereby indicates that the N terminal 80aa fragment does not participate in the SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction and the segment of aa 161\u2013210 of SARS_N is indispensable for this protein\u2013protein interaction.",

It has been reported that this SRXX-repeat fragment of MHV_N is within the MHV_N/hnRNP A1 interaction parts [15]. Therefore, encouraged by these facts, we supposed that the SRXX-repeat fragment of SARS_N might be also involved in the SARS_N/hnRNP A1 interaction. To validate this hypothesis, we synthesized the peptide (ASSRSSSRSRGNSRN) according to the fragment aa 183\u2013197 of SARS_N and applied it to Biacore assay. The curves of this peptide binding to the immobilized GST-hnRNP A1 (flow cell was immobilized with GST as control) were shown in Fig. 4\nA. The binding affinity of this peptide to the human hnRNP A1 protein was thus evaluated as K\nD at 148 \u00b1 12 \u03bcM by the steady-state fit model. To further confirm this specific binding of this SARS_N SRXX-repeat domain to hnRNP A1, we also performed an inhibitory experiment by using this peptide to inhibit hnRNP A1 interaction with the immobilized SARS_N protein through Biacore 3000. As shown in Fig. 4B, 100 and 625 \u03bcM of this peptide did perturb 10 \u03bcM hnRNP A1 binding to SARS_N protein, which thereby suggested that the SRXX-repeat fragment of SARS_N does contribute to the SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction.",

Since both human hnRNP A1 and SARS_N proteins bind to RNA and implement their functions in RNA replication and transcription [11], we thus tentatively proposed that, together with the bound RNA, SARS_N might probably interact with the human hnRNP A1 to form a complex in the regulation of the transcription and replication of SARS_CoV according to the reported model for MHV [11]. Therefore, it seems that the cross talk between human hnRNP A1 and SARS_N protein might be essential for SARS_CoV replication and transcription. Additionally, SARS_N protein binds to the C-terminus of human hnRNP A1 and cooperates with hnRNP A1 to recruit more proteins in forming the transcription or replication complex. As such, the C-terminal-deletion mutant of human hnRNP does not interact with SARS_N and fails to bring it into the initiation complex, possibly resulting in the failure of SARS-CoV RNA replication and transcription.",

            "text": "In addition, the yeast two-hybrid result has clearly indicated that only one fragment of SARS_N (aa 161\u2013211) is required for SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction, which is different from the MHV_N case where MHV_N has two domains, aa 1\u2013292 and aa 392\u2013455 that are involved in its binding to hnRNP A1 [15] (Fig. 5\n), suggesting that MHV_N/hnRNP A1 interaction seems to be stronger in comparison with SARS_N/hnRNP A1. As we know, the fragment aa 161\u2013211 contains SRXX-repeat domain that is multifunctional and conserved in N protein of coronaviruses [19]. In this work, the fact that the synthesized SRXX-repeat peptide has weak binding affinity (K\nD\n = 148 \u00b1 12 \u03bcM) to human hnRNP A1 (Fig. 2A) suggests that the SRXX-repeat segment of SARS_Nis involved in but does not dominate the SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction, which is also within the similar binding feature of this corresponding fragment in MHV_N (Fig. 5). Interestingly, it has been recently reported that SRXX-repeat fragment is indispensable for SARS_N multimerization [20] and for SARS_N interaction with SARS_CoV membrane protein [19]. All these facts have indicated that SRXX-repeat fragment of SARS_N protein might play a potent role in SARS_CoV infection, even though more studies should be addressed in exploring how SARS_N regulates itself to adapt its interaction with the different partners.",

Based on the analytical results for MHV, it is suggested that both SARS_N and human hnRNP A1 proteins might be among the SARS_CoV replication/transcription complex and their interaction may be involved in the regulation of SARS_CoV RNA synthesis. The fact that there is only one instead of two human hnRNP A1-binding domain in SARS_N indicates that the SARS_N protein interaction with human hnRNP A1 for SARS_CoV might take a different binding type compared with that for MHV, which is possibly due to the low sequence homology for SARS_CoV relative to other coronaviruses.",
