With >5,000 patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, our IBD center in Milan, Italy, has been flooded by requests from the patients themselves inquiring about the risk of infection in patients with IBD, and asking what precautions to take, particularly regarding, but not limited to, their immunosuppressive treatment. The COVID-19 outbreak is a fast and evolving situation, and information on the incidence and/or risk of infection in patients with IBD is not yet available. However, it is important to counsel patients to inform them that >80% of reported cases of COVID-19 have been mild in published studies, and the proportion of fatal cases might be an overestimate as many asymptomatic cases are not identified3.",

In addition to these measures, emerging reports state that patients might have viral RNA present in their faeces and live virus has been isolated from faecal samples4\u20136.

            "text": "An increasing number of patients with IBD treated with immunomodulators or biologic agents in our centre have asked whether a pause in their immunosuppressive therapy would be justified during the COVID-19 outbreak. At the moment, there are no formal evidence-based recommendations from clinical societies or governments for patients on immunosuppression, such as those with IBD. However, a study in a tertiary care population of 2,600 patients with IBD followed for >15,000 patient-years described an exhaustive characterization and validation (hospitalization reports) of all serious viral infections (for example, all that required hospitalization) including varicella zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) but not SARS-CoV-2 (ref.7). The follow-up included >3,800 patient-years of exposure to anti-TNF agents, >4,800 patient-years of exposure to immunosuppressants, and >1,200 patient-years of follow-up in those >65 years. The researchers identified 31 cases of serious viral infections related to EBV, CMV, VZV and HSV infection. The two independent drivers of the risk were clinically active IBD and exposure to thiopurines. No cases of severe seasonal flu and no deaths by seasonal flu were observed. Although many of our patients have been vaccinated against seasonal flu, as recommended by European Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines, vaccination strategy adoption is very low and the protective effect of the vaccine is moderate, particularly in patients with an immunosuppression status. Thus, at the moment, it does not seem appropriate to recommend the pause of immunosuppressive treatment in patients with IBD, as stated by International Organization of IBD8 (Fig. 1), Crohn\u2019s & Colitis UK and Crohn\u2019s & Colitis Foundation in their guidance for patients. Moreover, although thiopurines have been associated with risk of serious viral infection in IBD7, the IOIBD recommends they continue to be taken as these agents take months to leave the body and so stopping these medications will not help in the short term. In addition, a survey from the European Federation of Crohn\u2019s and Colitis association and ECCO is ongoing to explore the need for education about COVID-19.",

Multiple layers of complexity are faced during this challenging scenario. The interruption of any elective or routine follow-up clinic has caused anxiety among patients and clinicians. However, patients should be reminded that this interruption is temporary, and a shift towards virtual clinics can help patients and healthcare providers to avoid any potential loss of follow-up in case of clinical issues. This approach has also been initiated by IBD specialists in China during the COVID-19 outbreak9.",

Indeed, for influenza it has long been recommended that affected patients should wear masks to limit droplet spread and, therefore, the very same action could be used for immunosuppressed patients to reduce the risk of spread of infection. We have chosen to use surgical masks for both the clinical staff and the patients, but a global shortage of disposable surgical masks is creating challenges and this issue continues.",
