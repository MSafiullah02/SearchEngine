These problems affect the management of CAP, and lead to emergence of resistance as a result of overtreatment. Management decisions are complicated because there are few randomized controlled trials in children that evaluate different antibiotic therapies and treatment duration. Although guidelines exist, they are often based on poor-quality evidence.",

The cause of pediatric pneumonia is usually based on age, because that is the best predictor available (Table 3\n).",

However, WHO guidelines rely solely on respiratory rate and, using other criteria for a diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection, respiratory rate has been shown to be less sensitive and specific in the first 3 days of illness.31 In a study that defined pneumonia/lower respiratory tract infection as the presence of crepitations (crackles), wheeze, bronchial breathing, or chest radiograph (CXR) abnormalities, respiratory rates of less than 40 breaths/min were seen in 55% of children older than 35 months with a diagnosis of pneumonia.32 Canadian guidelines regard oxygenation as a good indication of the severity of disease,29 and oxygen saturation is recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) as a guide for referral of care and further diagnostic testing.33\n",

Similarly, mycoplasma pneumonia has been associated with cough, chest pain, and wheezing, symptoms being worse than the signs, as well as nonrespiratory symptoms such as arthralgia and headache, but studies have not successfully distinguished viral and bacterial CAP or between types of CAP by clinical signs alone.36, 37 In addition, many children with CAP have mixed bacterial and viral infections. Mycoplasma pneumonia is more common in children aged 5 years or younger, and is typically characterized by slow progression, sore throat, low-grade fever and cough developing over 3 to 5 days. Although some children have more abrupt onset of symptoms or higher fevers, this pattern may help to distinguish it from pneumococcal or staphylococcal pneumonia, and influence treatment decisions, because there are no rapid laboratory tests that allow clear distinction between classic bacterial and atypical pneumonia.",

Because age is the best predictor of cause of pediatric pneumonia, guidelines for treatment are typically categorized by age and suspected pathogens.33 BTS guidelines recommend that children with a clear clinical diagnosis of pneumonia should receive antibiotics, given that bacterial and viral pneumonia cannot be reliably differentiated.
