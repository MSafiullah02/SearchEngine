The main collective sanitary strategy for preventing contamination is social isolation, which could generate considerable distress, both for patients and caregivers. 24, 25 As a result, lack of access to regular psychosocial interventions or medication (and subsequent reduced adherence) could, of course, increase the chances of psychotic symptoms, which is a major concern.
