The census was reduced by delaying treatments when possible, changing to a more hypofractionated radiation schedule, or completing treatment as scheduled. Active redistribution started on 3/25/20 (Table 1 ). Decisions were made by individual clinicians with oversight of the chairman. Patients were also transferred from high volume COVID-19 centers to less COVID intense areas to allow for more rapid decrease in patient numbers at high COVID-19 sites. The census, broken down by disease site, is shown in Figure 3 . There was a median reduction of 30% for all disease sites except for breast and gynecology which had slight increases in patients. The department patient census was reduced by 27% to 125 by 4/1/20. Four patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during this month.

Staff wore surgical masks and gloves from 3/1/20 onward for suspected patients and after 3/16/20 for all patients.

The directives from the hospital would change daily, sometimes hourly, and controlling the message in the department was critical to calming fears and avoiding rumors from developing. In particular, reassuring staff regarding the availability of adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to perform their job was extremely important and a major factor in alleviating anxiety for the staff. We specifically requested department leaders not send out mass e-mails without approval from the Chair to avoid inadvertent conflicting information and communication overload. Also, letting the staff know that it is true we are scaling back, and might even close certain parts of our service temporarily, helped to provide full disclosure to deal with tough situation. For instance, the residency program director tried to meet with the residents via phone or teleconferencing several times a week to share any new information. When the highly anticipated redeployment came, everyone was better prepared to deal with it. There is talk of attending physicians being deployed, as well as nursing and administrative staff in the weeks ahead, and being open about it makes the discussion easier.",

The degree of separation between providers in the department and someone who has COVID-19, and then dies from COVID-19, rapidly closes. Everyone is on edge and concerned about their patients and the well-being of their loved ones. Knowing that the department is all working for one clear goal, to care for our fellow citizens, whether they have COVID-19, cancer, or neither, has held the department together and gives us purpose to continue this fight unto the next month. We hope that our experience will help other departments across the country prepare for their own fights. ",

Arguably, New York City with its dense, diverse population and large number of academic medical centers in a very small geographic radius, does not reflect the rest of the country. Nevertheless, knowing what happened in a large radiation oncology department that is part of a larger academic hospital provides insight into what departments might expect as each one will undoubtedly go through its own fast-paced struggle to adjust to the pandemic.
