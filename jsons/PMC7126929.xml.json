When caring for acutely ill athletes, sports medicine providers need to consider how the illness can affect the athlete\u2019s training, performance, and competition schedule; the risk of transmission of the illness to other team members; and the necessary precautions and contraindications related to treatment of the athletes and their return to participation. In addition, it is necessary to recognize that athletes training at an elite level, or for more prolonged periods of time, may be more susceptible to illness as a facet of an overtraining syndrome. This article focuses on the impact of acute illness on athletes as well as highlighting special considerations of specific acute illnesses as they relate to athletes.",

In situations in which there is not enough recovery, the athletes fail to improve and may see detrimental effects on their performance either in the form of nonfunctional overreaching or, in more extreme cases, overtraining syndrome.

Infections tend to occur in early autumn through early spring, with the greatest frequency occurring in the winter months. Athletes may be more at risk if they frequently travel for their sports, compete indoors, or have close contact with teammates and/or opponents. Rates of URTIs in athletes increase in the winter months, most likely because of crowding indoors, seasonal variations in pathogens, and physiologic changes that occur because of the cold.16, 17, 18 In addition, athletes may be more susceptible to URTIs if they are under increased psychosocial stress, are undergoing a personal crisis, or are experiencing any type of sleep disturbance.19, 20\n",

Classic pertussis infection is described as having 3 phases of illness: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The catarrhal phase lasts 1 to 2 weeks and is characterized by a mild, intermittent cough, low-grade fevers, and coryza. In the paroxysmal phase, infected individuals experience a spasmodic cough, posttussive emesis, and an inspiratory whoop. This phase can range from 1 to 6 weeks in duration. The convalescent phase is when the symptoms begin to subside, typically over 7 to 10 days, but they can last for months.24 The classic symptoms of posttussive emesis and whoop are rarely seen in clinical practice and, although their presence increases the specificity of pertussis, it is not enough to definitively diagnose pertussis.25 Confirmatory testing for pertussis is via a nasopharyngeal swab, which can be sent for either culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results from culture have poor sensitivity and specificity and can take several days to obtain. PCR is costlier, but much quicker, with results available in 1 to 2 days. Because of such limitations, most suspected cases are treated based on patient presentation and ideally include known recent exposure to a confirmed index case.25, 26\n",

Self-treatment with antibiotics for milder cases has been shown to increase microbial resistance.39 In general, fluoroquinolones are avoided for treatment of TD in the athletic setting, because of potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, including the rare but worrisome risk of tendon rupture in athletes. Azithromycin has been shown to be as effective for TD as fluoroquinolones and is now the preferred agent.40 Azithromycin is given as a 1000-mg single dose or as 500 mg daily for 3 days. In TD caused by E coli, rifaximin has been shown to be effective; however, it is not for use with any febrile diarrhea or dysentery.41 If a parasitic cause is suspected, metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 5 days is the preferred regimen. The use of antimotility agents such as loperamide and diphenoxylate has been considered controversial in the past, but it is now generally accepted as safe when taken with an antibiotic.9 More conservative recommendations for use in athletes suggest reserving it for use only preceding a competition or during a long trip.42 A summary of the recommendations for TD treatment can be found in Table 2\n.",

If prophylaxis is needed for an athlete, rifaximin is the antibiotic currently recommended at either 200 mg daily, twice daily, or 3 times daily because of a much lower side effect profile than the fluoroquinolones.43 Before travel to high-risk regions, athletes should be educated on prudent selection of food and drinks. Selecting only bottled water or carbonated canned drinks, both consumed from the bottle with a straw rather than from a glass, as well as only eating fully cooked hot food and fruit that is peeled by the eater can minimize risk. Avoidance of buffets, condiments, ice, and food provided on international return flights are additional measures that should be taken while athletes are traveling. Of course, proper handwashing and avoidance of sharing utensils or glassware are also necessary to minimize risk.",
