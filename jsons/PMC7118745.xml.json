The initiatives included: formation of a SARS taskforce; enhanced case surveillance; quarantine of contacts and travellers from SARS-affected areas; innovative ways of expanding isolation areas; institution of fever screening clinics at all health care facilities; a population-wide fever screening campaign; and a dedicated SARS fever hotline.1, 2, 3, 4 The SARS fever hotline, staffed by physicians, was introduced in June 2003 to advise callers regarding SARS, and refer them to appropriate healthcare service when necessary.",

The overall objective was prompt recognition of persons at high risk for SARS, thereby limiting the risk of possible transmission to others. In conjunction with this campaign, persons with fever or other features associated with SARS were encouraged to call a dedicated SARS fever hotline, which began operating on June 1, 2003. The purpose of the fever hotline was to prevent unnecessary visits to hospital and clinics. The hotline had a toll-free number and was staffed by physicians from the local medical association working 6-hour shifts between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Physicians triaged calls using an algorithm developed by members of the local medical association.",

The questionnaire included questions related to respondent demographics; SARS information source; knowledge about SARS; attitude towards, and beliefs about the hotline; and scenarios on referral practices. The questionnaire was developed in English, piloted, and translated into Mandarin Chinese, with translation and backtranslation being undertaken independently by bilingual public health professionals.5 Questionnaires were sent to the physicians on July 9, 2003. Telephone reminders were made on July 16, and July 22. These were followed by a postal reminder to non-responders on July 25.",

Not knowing the incubation period may have led the physicians to inappropriately triage persons with fever. In addition, there was a disparity in the level of knowledge among the hotline staff. The variety of medical and non-medical sources of information about SARS may have been responsible. Research has shown that staff providing telephone advice should have the appropriate knowledge and training to deal with calls.8 Standardized education and competency training before staffing the hotline would improve the quality of information provided by hotline physicians. Physicians obtained their information about SARS mainly from hospital guidelines and the news media. It is possible that the information from either or both of these sources was incorrect. An evaluation of the content of the news media and the hospital guidelines is beyond the scope of this study, but is an area of potential future research.",
