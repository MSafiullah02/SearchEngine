Until February 28th, 2105 cases were screened and 34 of them were diagnosed of COVID-19. During this period, 43 suspected patients were admitted to a medical center located in central Taiwan, and two of them were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Through multiplex PCR analysis with FilmArray\u2122 Respiratory Panel, the non-COVID-19 patients were later diagnosed of infections with other respiratory pathogens. Undoubtedly, early screening and diagnosis is crucial for the treatment and control of COVID-19. To establish the diagnostic protocol for this disease, in this report, we comparatively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients with those with other respiratory infections.",

Among the 3 patients with Coronavirus (229E/OC43) infection, only 1 had fever (33%), and the others had variable upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms, including diarrhea and abdominal pain. No pathogens were found by FilmArray\u2122 for two of non-COVID-19 patients, and both had alveolar infiltrates on the chest radiograph. All the 43 patients\u2019 respiratory specimens were tested twice for COVID-19 by rt-PCR within the first 2 days of admission.",

Rapid detection tools such as FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel can aid in early diagnosis of causative pathogens.

Of which, influenza A/B, human Metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common.11 The lack of specificity for clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and chest radiographs of COVID-19, as demonstrated in this report and previous studies,3\n,\n4\n,\n12 makes differential diagnosis of this disease from other viral respiratory infections difficult. Rapid detection tools of common respiratory virus and bacteria, such as FilmArray\u2122 Panel used here, help clinicians to determine causative pathogens of pneumonia in patients who are suspected with COVID-19 but have negative rRT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2. One of the huge challenges for preventing and controlling of this pandemic-prone disease13\n,\n14 is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic or presented flu-like symptoms.15\n,\n16 Under this circumstances, quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients and the application of rapid detection tools for etiology confirmation is strongly recommended.",
