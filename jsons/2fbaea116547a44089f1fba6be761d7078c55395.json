            "text": "Viral RNA can not be categorized into any of the three RNA types (messenger RNA, transfer RNA, and ribosomal RNA) since it contains all the genetic information of a virus, can act as a template, can serve as a messenger and directs the synthesis of relevant virus-specific proteins in a host cell, and multiplies under its own direction. Viral RNA is thus a self-replicating polycistronic messenger, a messenger that contains genes for two or more proteins. Parental viral RNA, upon release from ribosomes, switches from translation mode (during RdRp synthesis) to replication mode, and so triggers its own replication in which several viral proteins are involved that are together called replication proteins. Many viral replication proteins have been identified and characterized.",

            "text": "Viral RNA replication (formation of progeny genomic RNA molecules identical to the original parental RNA molecule) always starts from 3`-end that must be unwound. Viral RNA replication begins with specific recognition of cis-acting RNA elements on the infecting viral positive-strand RNA by membrane-bound viral replicase and/or associated host factors (Lai, 1998; Ahlquist, 1996, 1999; Chen and Ahlquist, 2000; Boon et al., 2001; Ahlquist et al., 2003; Noueiry and Ahlquist, 2003; and Boguszewska-Chachulska and Haenni, 2005) . Recognition of a promoter at 3`-end of positive-strand RNA genome/template of the infecting virus by RdRp starts the replication cycle of viral RNA genome. Specific cis-and trans-acting nucleotide sequences and RNA secondary structures within 5`-termini of virus genomic RNAs are central to virus RNA replication. The compulsion of unwinding of 3`-end of viral RNA is apparently correlated with the fact that several RdRps have a narrow template channel that can only accommodate single-stranded RNA or have mechanisms that discriminate against the use of double-stranded templates for de novo initiation (Lesburg et al., 1999; Butcher et al., 2001; Ranjith-Kumar et al., 2003a) . Vlot et al. (2001 , while working on replication/synthesis of AMV RNAs 1 and 2, arrived at three very significant conclusions. One, the virus possesses a mechanism that coordinates replication of RNAs 1 and 2 when present together in a cell. AMV p1 and p2 proteins may interact in cis; this interaction is between helicase domain of p1 and N-terminal region of p2 (van der Heijden et al., 2001) and may play a role in coordinated replication of AMV RNAs 1 and 2, although other factors may also be involved in this process (Vlot et al., 2001 . Two, this mechanism also provides selectivity to the replicase in the use of particular viral template RNA. Replicase not only selects genome RNAs that are essential for production of progeny but also selects the fittest template from a population of variants of a given genome segment. Three, the same or some other identical mechanism permits AMV to optimize its replication strategy by replicating only those RNAs that are essential for producing progeny that is infectious to the type of cell in which it was produced.",

            "text": "In increasing number of plant viruses, circularization of positive-strand genomic RNAs is involved in regulation of translation, replication and sgRNA synthesis. Circularization of RNAs occurs because of the long-distance RNA-RNA interactions between 5`-and 3`-terminal sequences. An interaction between the two termini [3`and 5`-ends] of the RNA appears to take place in many cases during RNA replication so that 3`-end sequence often can regulate RNA synthesis or translation initiated from 5`-end of RNA. The 3`-end sequence of BMV as well as of TMV RNAs does affect synthesis of positive-strand that begins from the 5`-end. Synthesis of BMV negativestrand RNA, which starts from 3`-end of RNA, requires a cis-acting enhancer sequence upstream of the subgenomic RNA promoter. A similar situation obtains in AMV in which an identical long-distance interaction between various RNA regions is required for initiation of subgenomic RNA synthesis (van der Vossen et al., 1995) . Two short elements on negative strands of satellite RNA C of TCV, one located at 11 bases from 3`-end and the other located 41 bases from 5`-end, are important for plus-strand RNA synthesis (Guan et al., 1997) . Qiu and Scholthof (2000) found that 263 nucleotides of 3`-UTR plus 73 nucleotides upstream of capsid protein stop codon and the first 16 nucleotides in 5`-UTR are required for RNA amplification and/or systemic spread of Satellite panicum mosaic virus (SPMV). In CPMV, both 3`-terminal cis-acting elements and a stem-loop upstream of poly(A) are important for replication of its RNA. The RNAs of BYDV have neither a cap structure nor a poly(A) tail, but longdistance base pairing between a stem-loop structure in 5`-UTR and a translation enhancer in 3`-UTR have been proposed to ensure circularization of RNAs and transfer provide some advantage to viruses because this ensures that only intact viral RNAs are used as templates for RNA replication and transcription. Communication between 5`cap and 3`-poly(A) tail, resulting in circularized mRNA, enhances translation of cellular mRNAs (Sachs, 2000) . Moreover, this leads to circularization of virus genome that greatly facilitates viral RNA replication.",

            "text": "Certain facts about replication of TMV RNA have been established experimentally. One, interaction between 126-and 183-kDa proteins has been demonstrated (Goregaoker et al., 2001 ) and a purified TMV RdRp preparation containing a 1:1 dimer of 126-and 183-kDa proteins is able to synthesize negative-strand RNA templates in vitro (Watanabe et al., 1999) . Two, TMV-L (tomato strain) 126-kDa replication protein of RdRp complex and TMV-L RNA 3`-terminal region are actually bound and it is a region of 126-and 183-kDa replication proteins located downstream of the core and Buck, 2003) . Three, domain D2 and central core region of TLS are the most important elements for binding of TMV RdRp complex to viral 3`-terminal region (Osman et al., 2000) . Four, Osman and Buck (2003) show that two aromatic amino acids (at positions 409 and 416) in this region of 126-and 183-kDa replication proteins in tomato protoplasts. These aromatic amino acids may either directly interact with nucleic acid bases of 3`-terminal region of RNA or be essential for maintaining the structure of P314-423 region of 126-or 183-kDa protein that binds to 3`-terminal region. It is likely that P314-423 region binds to core C and D2 domain of 3`-terminal region. The interacting sites of 126-and 183-kDa proteins are located within a 110-amino acid region just downstream of core methyltransferase domain and a region comprising of central core C and domain D2 in 3`-terminal region. Possibly, binding of this region of 126-and 183-kDa proteins to TMV-L 3`-terminal region of RNA could be essential for virus RNA replication. Lewandowski and Dawson (2000) showed that TMV 126-kDa protein appears to function in cis whereas 183-kDa protein can function in trans; and suggested that 126-kDa protein binds to its mRNA and targets it for replication. The 183-kDa protein might then bind to 126-kDa protein and initiate replication. Subsequent binding of 183-kDa protein to already bound 126-kDa protein may position the catalytically active site of polymerase domain at 3`-terminus of template RNA to enable initiation of negative-strand synthesis. Possible, binding of polymerase to 3`-terminal CCA sequence may be relatively weak. Hence, the function of 126-kDa protein may be both to recruit RNA templates for replication and to subsequently bind 183-kDa protein to methyltransferase domain that binds RdRp to RNA 3` -terminal region in vitro (Osman are essential for binding to RNA 3` -terminal region and for replication of TMV RNA position the catalytically active site of polymerase domain close to 3`-end of template RNA.",

The 5` tail of the nascent negative-strand RNA is not base-paired to the template so that a free negative-strand RNA product is produced with the result that the positive-strand RNA template gets released. The polymerase recognizes a promoter at 3`-end of the negative-strand-strand RNA, which is then employed as a template for synthesizing a positive-strand RNA resulting in the formation of replicative intermediate (RI) . Here also, the nascent positive-strand RNA remains base-paired to the negative-strand RNA template only in the area at which polymerase is attached to template and is actively synthesizing RNA. Hence the RI is mostly single-stranded and is constituted by the full-length negative-strand RNA template to which several positive-strands of RNA are attached. The progeny RNA strands again are largely single-stranded. This model of RNA replication occurs in Q\u03b2 virus RNA and possesses certain characteristics: the replicase of Q\u03b2 RNA is a holoenzyme so that it catalyzes complete replication of viral RNA, the RIs are mainly single-stranded, and replicase is incapable of using Q\u03b2 dsRNA as template.

Thus, the RdRp recognizes a promoter at end of RF RNA containing 3`-end of negative-strand and 5`-end of positive-strand. Synthesis of progeny positive-strand RNA molecules starts by employing the negative-strand as template. This happens by a strand displacement method that displaces the negativestrand from the dsRF RNA. The negative strands, by acting as templates, produce the RIs constituted by dsRNA with one or, by repeated reinitiation, several single-stranded 5` tails of full-length positive-strands of RNA. Thus, multiple progeny positive-strands of RNA are synthe-sized by repeated reinitiation and are then released. The first fulllength released positive-strand is the original template RNA strand. The above manner of synthesis of progeny positive strands from a RI RNA is analogous to the semiconservative transcription of dsRNA by strand displacement mechanism. This mechanism is characteristic of the dsRNA viruses of families Birnaviridae, Cystoviridae, and Partitiviridae. This model presupposes that the unwinding of dsRF RNA occurs at 3`-end of the negative-strand prior to the beginning of RNA synthesis and that a ds structure has to be recognised for initiation of positive-strand RNA synthesis (and for synthesis of subgenomic RNA in viruses that utilize subgenomic promoters).",

The minus-strand RNA of Pea seed-RNA replication (Wang and Maule, 1995) . Besides the viral template, three other inputs are essential for synthesis of negative-strand RNA: the TLS, promoter element, and RdRp. These are discussed below in some of the plant viruses. Olsthoorn and Bol (2002) and Olsthoorn et al. (2004) found that the 3`-terminal 145 nucleotides (that are common between the three AMV RNAs) can adopt a TLS and act as a core promoter for initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis at 3`-end of template. They identified a single stem-loop structure, the triloop hairpin E (hpE), as the negative-strand RNA promoter, which is the most important and essential element for negative-strand RNA synthesis in vitro while presence of B, C, and D hairpins is required for optimum negative-strand synthesis. The proposed major role of TLS is to enforce initiation of transcription by polymerase at the very end of genome. The structure of hpE is conserved in all AMV isolates sequenced so far and features a 10-base pair stem, a 4-nucleotide bulge and a UGG triloop. The UGG triloop sequence is not essential for in vitro transcription but may be playing some role in vivo. The negative-strand promoter hpE and subgenomic RNA promoter hairpin of AMV are equivalent in binding viral polymerase, share many common features and are essential for performing their respective assigned function. A similar stem-loop structure can be formed at the homologous position in 3`-UTR of RNAs of about all ilarviruses. In PDV RNA1 and RNA3, a triloop, that strongly resembles hpE, can be folded. In apple mosaic virus RNA3 and prunus necrotic ringspot virus RNA3, a pentaloop hairpin is Structures similar to AMV negative-strand promoter hpE have been identified in (Sivakumaran et al., 2000) . These are conserved structures and are required for their respective negative-strand synthesis. Stem-loop structure C (SLC) at 3`-end of BMV RNA consists of 11 base pairs, a triloop, a 4-nucleotide bulge and thus resembles the AMV hpE. The SLC of several isolates of CMV consists of 13 base pairs, a 5`-nucleotide bulge, and a triloop; but variants with a pentaloop do also exist (Sivakumaran et al., 2000) . The 5`-UTRs of BMV RNAs contain stem-loop structures with loop sequences resembling box B elements homologous to T C stem-loop of cellular tRNAs. These elements are required for negative-strand RNA synthesis (Chen et al., the only conserved sequences between BMV and CMV stem-loop structures. BMV RdRp can specifically recognise the 5`-most A in AUA triloop that is involved in the so-called adenine motif. This feature is unlike AMV RdRp, which seems to be insensitive to loop sequence but can probably recognise specific base pairs in the stem. Thus, related viruses have evolved different strategies to recognise their negativestrand promoter hairpins.",

            "text": "The 3`-terminal elements important for negative-strand synthesis in vitro include the CCA sequence domains D1 (equivalent to a tRNA acceptor arm), D2 (similar to a tRNA anticodon) and D3 (an upstream pseudoknotted region) and a central core region C that connects domains D1, D2, and D3. Cheng et al. (2002) have propounded a working model for negative-strand RNA synthesis of BaMV. (a) The RdRp interacts with 3`-UTR [including the potexviral conserved hexamer motif (ACNUAA)] and about 20 nucleotides of poly(A) sequence immediately downstream of 3`-UTR (Huang et al., 2001) , which may be used to Replication of Plus-Sense Viral RNA Wang and Wong (2004) found that synthesis of HCRSV minus-strand RNA is initiated opposite the 3`-terminal two C residues at the 3`-end in vitro and in vivo and that the 3`-terminal CCC nucleotides have essential role in minus-strand RNA synthesis because minus-strand RNA initiation begins at 3`-terminal two Cs. This is similar to the results obtained from BMV (Chapman and Kao, 1999) , TMV (Osman and Buck, 1996) , and TYMV (Singh and Dreher, 1997) , in which initiation of minusstrand RNA synthesis also starts opposite the two Cs while minus-strand RNA synthesis is reduced upon removal or substitution of terminal A in the CCA box. In TYMV RNA, the 3` TLS present the CCA-3` in a conformation that is easily accessible to the replicase (Dreher, 1999) . The CCC-3` may also be involved in forming a conformation for replicase access both in vitro and in vivo in HCRSV (Wang and Wong, 2004) . However, the presence of a CCC-3` terminal sequence alone is not sufficient for RNA synthesis as is evident from below. located within the 3`-terminus 87 nucleotides of HCRSV plus-strand RNA are also essential for minus-strand RNA synthesis (Wang and Wong, 2004) . The first SL is very similar to the single SL that is a minimum promoter for minus-strand RNA synthesis of TCV satellite RNA C (Song and Simon, 1995) . This suggests that the two predicted SLs in HCRSV might also play a similar role. The U loop located on SL2 is an essential structure for RNA synthesis in HCRSV. The secondary structure of SLs in 3`-UTR of RNA viruses is required for protein binding (Lai, 1998) . For example, the hpE loop of AMV is not essential for RNA synthesis, whereas the stem and base pairing of the lower triloop are essential (Olsthoorn and Bol, 2002) . Similarly, failure to bind replication factors by HCRSV mutants, with disruption or deletion of SL1 or SL2, rendered them unable to initiate minus-strand synthesis. Disruption of certain SLs in BMV (Chapman and Kao, 1999) , TYMV (Deiman et al., 1997) , AMV (Olsthoorn et al., 1999) , and CTV (Satyanarayana et al., 2002a) resulted in reduction in minusstrand RNA synthesis, but not in complete inhibition of RNA synthesis as in HCRSV. In TCV 3`-UTR, elements located hundreds of nucleotides upstream of 3`-UTR, were needed for efficient replication (Carpenter et al., 1995) . Taken together, the specific sequence CCC at the 3`-terminus and the two SL structures located in the 3`-UTR are essential for efficient minus-strand RNA synthesis in HCRSV.",

(b) After interaction of RdRp with 3`-UTR of BaMV RNA, the RdRp is suggested to initiate minus strand RNA synthesis opposite one of the adenylates within the pseudoknot. This is done perhaps selectively in the loop region of the pseudoknot, which is the most favoured position for initiation.

This asymmetry is characteristically found in all positive-strand RNA viruses investigated.

These two types of switches act in trans. The intercistronic region is adjacent to ICR2 1100 (ICR2-like sequence present at nucleotide 1100), exerts trans-acting effect on BMV replication, and is essential for positive-strand RNA3 amplification as well as for asymmetry of BMV replication.

(2002b) found that protein 23 (p23) gene of CTV regulated asymmetric accumulation of positive-and negative-stranded subgenomic RNAs; that this protein mainly down-regulated the accumulation of negative-stranded sgRNAs and caused only a modest increase in accumulation of positive-stranded sgRNA; that amino acid residues 46 to 180, which contained RNA-binding and zinc finger domains, were indispensable for asymmetric RNA accumulation while N-terminal 5 to 45 and Cterminal 181 to 209 amino acids residues were not required; that zinc finger is possibly involved in asymmetric RNA accumulation; and that the excess negative-stranded sgRNA reduces the availability of corresponding positive-strand sgRNA as a messenger. Thus, p23 protein serves as a switch to convert replication from symmetrical to asymmetrical production of positive-and negative-stranded RNA of both genomic and sgRNAs by down regulating negative-strand RNA accumulation. L\u00f3pez et al. (2000) demonstrated that CTV p23 gene product binds RNA in vitro and RNA-binding domain mapped between amino acid residues 50 to 68, which include the putative zinc finger domain.",

Synthesis of RNA increases almost linearly during the first 60 hr period but declines subsequently. In fact, RNA synthesis in infected protoplasts begins in less than 4 hr post-inoculation (hpi), becomes exponential and remains so until 8 hpi, drops sharply and becomes linear at about 10 hpi and then continues to increase linearly. Synthesis of single-stranded and double-stranded RNAs (RF and RI RNAs) also nearly follows the same curve: they are first detected at 6-8 hpi, increase exponentially till about 20 hpi after which their increase becomes linear. Maximum synthesis of doublestranded RNA occurs at 18-20 hpi and that of single-stranded RNA at 24-26 hpi. About 20 minutes are required for synthesis of a TMV RNA molecule during exponential stages of replication. The synthesized viral RNA is quickly incorporated into viral protein to form virions. First progeny TMV appears in cytoplasm of mesophyll protoplasts 6 hr after inoculation. TMV particles are formed exponentially during early stages of virus replication but linearly during the late stages. TMV virion formation is exponential during 50-80 hpi but declines to become linear subsequently. Large number of virus particles is produced. Similarly, replication of Pea seed-borne mosaic potyvirus is rapid (Wang and Maule, 1995) . So is of TEV, which infects approximately one new cell every two hours (Dolja et al., 1992) .",

Replication promoters are present in several plant viruses like CNV (Panavas et al., 2002a (Panavas et al., , 2002b and other plant viruses mentioned in the text.

Negative-strand RNA synthesis from BMV RNA3 templates requires 1a and 2a replication proteins and is driven by a promoter in the 3` TLS of RNA3 (Ishikawa et al., 1997; Chapman and Kao, 1999) . In turn, negative-stand RNA3 acts as a template for positive-strand RNA3 synthesis and sgRNA transcription and is driven by promoters adjacent to their BMV RNA3 acts as a template for RNA replication as well as for sgRNA transcription, which is initiated internally on negative-strand RNA3 templates.

A recruiting role in negative strand would require subsequent delivery of RdRp to positive strand promoter at 3`-end of template.

The H5 is proximal to the core promoter and functions as a repressor of minus-strand synthesis in vitro through an interaction between LSL and 3` terminal bases in TCV satellite RNA satC (which has partial sequence similarity with its helper virus Turnip crinkle virus). Of the 14-base satC H5 LSL, specific sequences in the middle and upper regions on both sides of the LSL are necessary for robust TCV as well as of satC accumulation in plants and protoplasts.

            "text": "The mechanism of template selection by cognate replicases for viral RNA replication in plus-strand RNA viruses is poorly understood, so is the contribution of viral and cellular proteins to RNA template recognition. Two types of experimental evidence have been published in this connection. The first type shows that, in infected cells, viral replicases specifically recognize and selectively replicate their cognate viral RNAs from a heterogeneous pool of cellular RNAs. Thus, virus-encoded proteins facilitate selective template recruitment to viral replicase complex in vivo as is true of the 1a protein of BMV and the 126-kDa protein of Tomato mosaic virus (Sullivan and Ahlquist, 1999; Chen et al., 2001; Osman and Buck, 2003) . In contrast, many purified viral replicase complexes effectively utilize heterologous promoter or initiation elements during in vitro studies (Yoshinari et al., 2000; Kao, et al., 2001; Rajendran et al., 2002) . These conflicting in vivo and in vitro results were explained on the basis of the suggestion that host factors are involved in selective recognition of viral templates by the relevant RdRp (Buck, 1996) . Even in the two above-mentioned cases of specific template selection by viral RdRps, it is uncertain whether the respective viral RNAs are recognised directly by these replicase proteins or some assistance is provided by the host proteins (Diez et al., 2000) . This issue appears to be settled at least in TBSV by Pogany et al. (2005) , on which this section is mainly based. The TBSV p33 and p92 replication proteins are essential for RNA replication; are part of viral replicase complex; accumulate in vivo in 20:1 ratio, respectively (Scholthof, K. B.-G et al., 1995; Panaviene et al., 2004) ; and less plentiful p92 functions as viral RdRp, while role of the more abundant p33 was not known (White and Nagy, 2004) although it was regarded to play some unknown essential but auxiliary role. Pogany et al. (2005) demonstrated that recombinant p33 replicase protein binds specifically in vitro to a conserved internal replication element (IRE) located within the p92 RdRp coding region of viral genome; specific recognition and binding of p33 to IRE RNA element in vitro depended on the presence of a C . C mismatch within a conserved RNA helix; binding of p33 to RNA depended on the presence of the conserved RII(+)-SL hairpin, which serves as an internal recognition element; and strong correlation existed between p33:IRE complex formation in vitro and viral replication in vivo, so that mutations in IRE that disrupted selective p33 binding in vitro also abolished TBSV RNA replication both in plant and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. They proposed that p33:IRE interaction provides a mechanism to selectively recruit viral RNAs into cognate viral replicase complexes, specifically binds the cognate viral RNA template in vitro, directs viral template recruitment into replication mode; that the major RNA element recognized by p33 is a C 99 . C 143 mismatch in an internal loop within the RII(+)-SL; and proposed that one of the 5`-side . However, the 3`-side of SL3 and H5 internal loops are 99 . C 143 Pogany et al. (2005) proposed a model, on the bases of their in vitro and in vivo studies and the results of Monkewich et al. (2005) , for the central role for the RII(+)-SL, p33, and possibly p92 act together at an early step in replication to facilitate model for explaining the occurrence of this perceived process. The p33 and p92 proteins are translated from the genome soon after infection; the RII(+)-SL is possibly formed in the genome transiently (Monkewich et al., 2005) ; p33 interacts productively with RII(+)-SL when a required p33 threshold concentration is reached; and recognition . is dependent on protein dimerization or oligomerization (which may also involve p92); and requirement of oligomerization suggests that the interface of the protein subunits the membrane targeting signals present in the N terminus of p33 and p92 (Rubino and Russo, 1998) . Recruitment to membranes could also down-regulate the translation process [as in Brome mosaic virus (Janda and Ahlquist, 1998) ]. In contrast, subgenomic mRNAs transcribed during infection would not be recruited to replication complexes since they lack RII(+)-SL, and so would remain dedicated to translation. In this model, the selective binding of p33 (and/or p92) to RII(+)-SL-containing RNAs is proposed to be the primary factor in vivo for the observed specificity of Tombusvirus RNA replication. In short, the essential role of the p33:p33/p92 interaction domain in selective RNA binding suggests that intermolecular interaction between two or more p33s (and/or possibly p92) proteins results in the formation of an RNA-binding pocket that has high specificity for the C . C mismatch within RII(+)-SL.",

Besides, CP is involved in some replication step of TMV; it regulates formation of replication complexes (Asurmendi et al., 2004) . Moreover, genome-associated CP may also prevent collision between translating ribosomes and replicase molecules synthesizing negative-strands. CP taking part in AMV life cycle can be categorized into two types -CP that is originally present in viral inoculum since it is associated with viral RNAs; and CP that is synthesized from viral subgenomic RNA4 and appears later in viral life cycle.

The CP binds to each of three genomic RNAs in inoculum; the RNAs are then targeted to membranebound replication complexes where each RNA is transcribed into the corresponding negative strand. Capsid protein is not involved in this transcription process but, after complete synthesis of the negative strand, CP associates with replicase to make the enzyme complex competent for synthesis of the progeny positive-strand RNAs. The CP bound to AMV and ilarvirus RNAs most likely gives them some competitive advantage over the cellular mRNAs since it behaves like PABP, interacts with host translation factors bound to 5`-cap structure of viral genome, and stimulates translation of viral RNAs.

(1999) postulated that presence of TLS or a linear array of hairpins, the mutually exclusive and alternative conformations, at 3`-termini of RNAs of AMV and ilarviruses may be the switch that enables viral RNA to shift from translation to replication mode and vice versa. The linear array of stem-loop structures contains several high-affinity CP-binding sites while tRNA-like conformation is specifically recognised by RdRp. It is proposed that 3`-UTR acts as a molecular switch that regulates the transition from translation to replication of parental RNAs. In this model, CP bound to inoculum RNAs would force the 3`-UTR into the CP-binding conformation to enhance translation and/or to prevent premature initiation of negativestrand RNA synthesis. Subsequently, CP dissociates from parental RNA to allow TLS formation and initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis.",
