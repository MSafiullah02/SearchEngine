In addition, expanded testing of NP samples was undertaken for a range of respiratory pathogens by NATs using extraction and amplification methods that have been described previously.11 Briefly, NATs were designed to amplify and detect influenza A and B, hMPV, RSV, rhinovirus, parainfluenza 1\u20134, coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, and NL63), and adenoviruses. All the NATs utilized in this study have been published, and the assay parameters evaluated.11, 12, 19, 20 Laboratory validation of these assays confirmed a limit of detection of \u2264 100 copies (cloned target or synthetic RNA) or one or fewer tissue culture infectious dose of 50% (for culturable viruses). The specificity of all assays was confirmed using samples and spiked materials containing high loads of alternative respiratory pathogens. (Further details on viral NATs are available from J.D.F. on request [also see references 11, 12, 19, 20].)",

            "text": "The strengths of this study include its prospective nature and the thorough collection of data from a cohort of consecutive patients who had been admitted to the hospital with CAP. There are also several limitations to the study. First and foremost, despite our best efforts and a detailed study protocol, a number of bacterial investigations (ie, blood culture, sputum culture, and convalescent serum specimens) were missed, thereby potentially underestimating the number of cases of bacterial pneumonia and (potentially) underestimating the number of mixed infections. The number of missed bacterial investigations may be the reason for our 61% rate of unknown infections, although our rate of recovery is similar to other studies22, 31, 32, 33, 34 that have reported 47 to 60% unknown infections. Second, we excluded patients without evaluable NP swabs from our analyses. Not obtaining specimens for conducting a NAT was a study protocol violation in 13% of patients (39 of 300 patients). We speculate that either NP swabs were not collected when patients transitioned from the emergency department to the wards, or that there was a miscommunication with the reference laboratory regarding when or where to send the study-related swabs. That said, there were few important clinical differences between patients with and without evaluable NP swabs, with two exceptions. Those patients without evaluable NP swabs were more likely to have lobar pneumonia, which, according to our data, would bias the results toward bacterial infection. Those patients without evaluable NP swabs were also more likely to be functionally impaired, which would bias the results toward viral infection. Third, there is potential for both false-positive and false-negative NP results, although testing with NATs has been reported to have excellent sensitivity and specificity.12 As noted above, sequence divergence for the rhinoviruses (and, potentially for the other virus groups) may also have led to some underestimation of the number of viral infections. Fourth, we detected viruses in the upper respiratory tract using NP specimens, which does not necessarily equate with the causation of pneumonia. However, the purpose of this study was to describe the potential role of respiratory viral infection in those patients with pneumonia; a study describing \u201cconfirmed\u201d viral pneumonia would require lung tissue samples from all enrolled patients. Last, our overall sample size might be considered small by some, and our cohort was drawn from only one health region in Canada, which might limit the generalizability of the results to some degree.",

Differentiating between patients with viral infection and those without based on clinical findings and routine laboratory test results remains a challenge. Indeed, although we were unable to perform a multivariable logistic regression analysis due to the small sample size, it seems unlikely that any constellation of symptoms, signs, and routine laboratory findings will ever reliably differentiate between the presence or absence of a virus.3, 10, 29, 30 Current guidelines3 recommend empiric antibiotic therapy targeted against common bacterial pathogens for patients who are admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. How to manage patients with pneumonia and a respiratory viral infection, without a documented coexisting bacterial pathogen, is far less clear. Future research, similar to that found in the pediatrics literature, is needed to help answer whether empiric therapy with antibiotics can be discontinued in this clinical scenario.35\n",

            "text": "Perhaps most importantly, the inability to identify patients with a respiratory virus without comprehensive respiratory viral testing is a concern from the perspective of infection control. The presence of a respiratory viral infection can result in nosocomial outbreaks. For instance, outbreaks due to influenza have been well documented,28 and cases of RSV and hMPV nosocomial transmission are increasingly recognized.28, 36, 37 The nosocomial spread of respiratory viruses among adults poses the biggest threat to immunocompromised patients, including frail elderly patients.3, 38, 39, 40 The current infection control guidelines recommend placing patients with a suspected respiratory viral infection in private rooms or cohorting them with patients with the same viral infection as a way to prevent transmission.41 Given the 15% prevalence of viral infection in adults in our study, and the indistinguishable presentation from typical bacterial pneumonia, our results suggest routine isolation (with droplet and contact precautions) of all adults with pneumonia, from the time of hospital admission until respiratory viral infection is ruled out, should be considered to help prevent the nosocomial transmission of respiratory viruses. This suggested approach should become logistically feasible when the turnaround time for NAT results is < 24 h and as the price of testing with NATs decreases over time. This will be facilitated by emerging commercial viral identification assays that are both accurate and relatively inexpensive.42\n",
