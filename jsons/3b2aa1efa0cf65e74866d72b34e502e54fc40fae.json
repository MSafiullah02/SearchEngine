            "text": "Nitric oxide (NO) plays important roles in physiology and pathology. This small molecule regulates smooth muscle tone, functions as a neurotransmitter, regulates cellular proliferation, and protects the host against neoplasia and infection (1) . NO may also mediate deleterious effects. For example, it appears to be important in inflammation, carcinogenesis, aging, and neurotoxicity (1) (2) (3) . NO is produced from L-arginine by the actions of NO synthases (NOS), a family of enzymes encoded by separate genes (4, 5) . Neuronal NOS (NOSI, found mainly in neuronal cells and skeletal muscle cells) and endothelial NOS (NOS3, found mainly in endothelial cells) are produced constitutively. Their actions are controlled in large part by changes in intracellular calcium concentrations, and NOS1 and NOS3 generate low-level NO production. Inducible NOS (iNOS or NOS2) is expressed by numerous cell types, but mainly by mononuclear phagocytes, hepatocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells (5, 6) . Activity of NOS2 is controlled primarily by regulation of mRNA transcription and translation. Under proper conditions, NOS2 produces very high levels of NO.",

Regulation of NOS2 mRNA can occur at multiple steps (see ref. 5 for review), including mRNA transcription, mRNA stability, mRNA translation, and mRNA level (precise mechanisms not known). At the protein level, NOS may be regulated in many ways: by calmodulin binding, dimer formation (the functional enzyme exists as a dimer), substrate (L-arginine) depletion, substrate recycling (L-citrulline to L-arginine), tetrahydrobiopterin availability, endproduct inhibition (NO interaction with NOS heme), phosphorylation, and subcellular localization. Important NOS co-factors include FAD, FMN, NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin, and calmodulin-calcium. For NOS2, calmodulin is tightly bound to protein, making it relatively resistant to inhibition by calcium chelators. The enzymatic activity of NOS can be markedly influenced by levels of tetrahydrobiopterin-depleting cellular tetrahydrobiopterin by inhibitors of GTP cyclohydrolase I, sepiapterin reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase reduces NOS activity (7) . Cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can enhance tetrahydrobiopterin production (8, 9) . Heme is a critical component of NOS; NO can act as a feedback inhibitor of NOS activity by binding to, and perhaps oxidizing, the iron in heme (10, 11) .",

            "text": "Much of the work that has examined NOS2 regulation and NO production by mononuclear phagocytes has been done using mouse or rat peritoneal macrophages, or mouse neoplastic macrophage cell lines derived from tissue macrophages. Evidence was established that macrophage-elaborated NO played major roles in mediating anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and proinflammatory effects of macrophages. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, investigators attempting to extend the rodent results to human mononuclear phagocytes had difficulty demonstrating high-level NOS2 expression and NO production by these human cells (see refs. 12,13 for reviews), even though researchers had shown that humans can produce NO (and the NO metabolites nitrite/nitrate) after infection or after treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) (14) (15) (16) (17) , and that Fig . 1 . Expression of NOS2 and production of NO by mononuclear phagocytes. Transcription of NOS2 mRNA can be enhanced (+) by certain cytokines, growth factors, and microbial components. Transcription and translation of NOS2 mRNA can be diminished (-) by glucocorticoids, TGF-beta, various cytokines, and iron. The enzyme NOS converts Larginine to nitric oxide and L-citrulline, and it requires NADPH, biopterin, FMN, FAD, oxygen, and heme for activity. Depletion of L-arginine or tetrahythis NO was derived from L-arginine (15) . With improvements in techniques and reagents [e.g., more sensitive assays for NO-related products, specific anti-NOS2 antibodies, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques], recent studies have more convincingly documented NOS2 protein and mRNA expression and NO production by mononuclear phagocytes with certain treatments in vitro and in vivo and in a variety of disease states. In several instances, there are no adequate explanations for the varying results from apparently identical experiments done in different research laboratories, with some showing induction of NO production and NOS2 expression and some not, despite using comparable techniques. Whereas most rat and mouse studies are done with genetically homogenous (often inbred and syngeneic) animals, human studies involve genetically heterogenous subjects. Genetic polymorphisms in drobiopterin diminishes activity. L-arginine analogues such as NG-monomethyl-L-arginine block enzyme activity. Nitric oxide can inhibit NOS activity by interacting with and perhaps oxidizing the enzyme's heme group. Superoxide and oxygen rapidly diminish nitric oxide activity by oxidizing it. Iron, heme, and cobalamins can blunt nitric oxide's activity by binding nitric oxide to their iron or cobalt. Abbreviations: IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; CaM, calmodulin; L-arg, L-arginine. certain cytokine genes or in the NOS2 gene could explain some of the variability among different laboratories. Kun et al. have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in the NOS2 promoter region (in a IFN-'y response element) that is associated with protection from severe malaria (18) . They have postulated that those with this polymorphism will have higher levels of transcription of NOS2 in response to stimuli than those with the wild-type gene.",

Certain problems may arise in chemically measuring NO and its metabolites (19) . In oxygen-containing environments, NO is converted within seconds to nitrite and nitrate (in approximate equimolar concentrations) (20) . Chemiluminescence measurements of NO in solution might underestimate amounts of NO formed because of the short-lived nature of the molecule. Nitrite and nitrate are generally stable and unreactive at neutral pH. Nitrite can be relatively easily measured spectrophotometrically using the Griess reaction (21, 22) . Nitrate is generally measured after conversion of nitrate to nitrite with nitrate reductase, and subsequent use of the Griess reaction. In the presence of hemoglobin (and other heme-containing compounds), nitrite is converted to nitrate; thus, studies in which only nitrite is measured may underestimate the amount of NO formed. NO may react with lowand high-molecular-weight thiols, and thus not be measured in the conventional measurements of nitrite/nitrate (20) . NO can react with superoxide to form peroxynitrite. This, in turn, can result in nitrotyrosine formation with free tyrosine or with tyrosine-containing proteins (23) ; this too would not be measured in conventional assays of nitrite/nitrate. Some tissue culture media (e.g., most preparations of RPMI-1640) contain added nitrate, and sera used in tissue culture may contain variable amounts of nitrite/nitrate. Thus, unless investigators measure nitrite/nitrate content of their cell-free culture medium with serum, errors may occur.",

I discuss studies in which human blood and tissue cells have been explanted and examined either with no in vitro manipulation or after in vitro culture and treatment. I do not include studies in which investigators measured only serum, plasma, gas, or tissue fluid NO or NO metabolites. Some studies of blood cells have used purified monocytes, while others have used mononuclear cells (MNC-monocytes, lymphocytes, and variable numbers of platelets) isolated by centrifugation over ficoll-Hypaque. Some of the studies have used immune assays to identify cells (e.g., anti-CD14 or anti-CD68 antibodies to identify mononuclear phagocytes), while others have not. Most have assumed that monocytes in the MNC were the likely sources of NO, but investigators have also reported NO production and NOS2 expression by human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B lymphocyte cell line cells (24) and transformed human T cell line cells (25) . Furthermore, normal B and T lymphocytes have been noted to express NOS3 mRNA as detected by RT-PCR (26) . These studies signify that lymphocytes in the MNC fraction might also produce NO. Likewise, there are reports that human platelets contain NOS2 and can produce NO (27) (28) (29) . However, significant levels of NO production by lymphocytes and platelets (compared to mononuclear phagocytes) is unlikely (30) . I also discuss reports analyzing tissues taken from humans and analyzed by immunocytology or immunohistology, in situ hybridization, or RT-PCR for NOS2 mRNA expression. Reports of NOS2 expression and NO expression by cells from patients with various clinical disorders are also evaluated.",

It is important to note that cell manipulation by preparation with centrifugation, etc., and with culture in plastic vessels with media and sera may in itself \"activate\" cells. Salvemini et al. showed that human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and MNC released a factor that blocked thrombininduced platelet aggregation (31) . The inhibition was abrogated by oxyhemoglobin and L-arginine analogues, and was enhanced by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Although they did not measure NO, their data suggested that the inhibiting factor was NO. Hunt and Goldin noted that normal monocytes spontaneously generated nitrite with in vitro culture (32) . This nitrite production was stimulated by LPS and inhibited by NMMA. Middleton et al. found that unstimulated human MNC caused relaxation of rat colonic smooth muscle and that this effect was inhibited by NMMA, hemoglobin, or the guanylate synthase inhibitor methylene blue; superoxide dismutase enhanced the relaxing effect (33). Granulocytes had a comparable effect. Martin and Edwards found that, with time in culture, human monocytes had an increase in nitrite production and an increase in tumoricidal effect (34) . The nitrite production and tumor cell killing were inhibited by NMMA.",

On the other hand, Petit et al. found that spontaneous monocyte-mediated anti-tumor activity was not inhibited by L-arginine analogues and that tumoristatic monocytes did not produce nitrite (36) . Using RT-PCR, Chu and associates studied NOS2 mRNA expression in alveolar macrophages from a normal subject (37) . NOS2 mRNA was found in untreated, freshly isolated alveolar macrophages that were allowed to adhere to plastic. There was evidence of structural diversity in the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA, with the use of multiple transcription initiation sites. Eissa et al. showed (using RT-PCR techniques) that normal human alveolar macrophages contained NOS2 mRNA, and that the mRNA showed evidence of extensive alternative splicing (38) .

Even though Granger and colleagues had shown earlier that mouse macrophages required L-arginine for inhibiting growth of Cryptococcus neoformans (39) , they reported in 1990 that human alveolar and peritoneal macrophages from normal individuals mediated fungistasis independently of L-arginine metabolism (40) . In this study, Cameron and co-workers could find no evidence that these human cells could generate NO or L-citrulline from L-arginine.

Gyan et al. showed that human MNC cultured with IFN-,y produced increased amounts of nitrite and inhibited growth of Plasmodium falciparum (54) . Furthermore, the anti-parasite effect was partially blocked by NMMA. Leibovich et al. found that treatment of monocytes with LPS stimulated their production of angiogenic activity, and this increase in activity paralleled an increase in production of nitrite and nitrate (55) . The production of the angiogenic activity and of nitrite/ nitrate was reduced when cells were cultured in media low in L-arginine, or when cells were cultured with NMMA. Martin and Edwards noted that with increasing time in culture (up to 9 days), there was an increase in monocyte production of nitrite (56) . This effect was not altered by IFN-,y, although IFN-y did augment the monocyte-mediated tumor cytotoxicity. Zembala et al. noted that normal human monocytes cultured with LPS, IFN-,y, IL-2, and TNF did not produce nitrite, but culture of the monocytes with a human colorectal cell line (DeTa) caused the monocytes to produce nitrite (57) . This production was inhibited by L-arginine analogues. The stimulation of nitrite formation by DeTa cells was inhibited by antibodies directed against CD44, CD29 (VLA-f31), CD58 (LFA-3), and MHC class I or II antigen (but not by several other antibodies) (58). Bose and Farnia found that human monocytes treated with IFN-,y, TNF, and IL-1 (and subsequently \"triggered\" with LPS) produced nitrite (59) . The cells produced higher levels of nitrite with increasing time in culture.",

Immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that IFN-,y induced detectable levels of NOS2 antigen. IFN-,y and LPS caused peritoneal macrophages to produce nitrite/nitrate, and increased levels of NOS enzymatic activity in both monocytes and macrophages (30) . A large number of other agents in various combinations with LPS and IFN-,y were tested for ability to induce production of high level nitrite/nitrate production, and none were effective; these included GM-CSF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-6, 1,25 vitamin D3, PMA, the calcium ionophore A2 3187, and the lectins concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin. Likewise, live and heatkilled M. avium, M. tuberculosis, L. monocytogenes, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and HIV-1 did not enhance nitrite/nitrate production. Furthermore, culture in 3% to 50% human, dog, or fetal bovine serum (FBS; heated or unheated) did not cause nitrite/nitrate formation. Additions of excess L-arginine, NADPH, sepiapterin, or biopterin did not enable the cells to produce nitrite/nitrate. Also, in experiments mixing lysates of murine and human cells and in experiments using neutralizing antibodies against TGF-/31, these investigators could show no evidence of an endogenous inhibitor of NOS expression or function in the human monocytes and macrophages (30) . Zinetti and co-workers noted that NMMA, hemoglobin, or myoglobin would inhibit LPS-induced TNF secretion by MNC and THP-1 cells even though they could detect no evidence of nitrite formation (64) . They felt that their work gave evidence that endogenously produced NO modulated TNF production. Condino-Neto et al. studied pa-569 tients with chronic granulomatous disease who had received IFN-,y in vivo for 6 months (65). There found no evidence that IFN-,y enhanced nitrite/nitrate synthesis by monocytes or neutrophils when tested in vitro for nitrite/nitrate production or for inhibition of platelet aggregation. Kashem et al. demonstrated by immunocytology that treatment of normal monocytes in vitro with a combination of TNF and IFN-,y caused expression of NOS2 mRNA (66) . St. Clair and associates showed that freshly isolated monocytes and MNC from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (when compared with those of normal subjects) had increased NOS enzyme activity and increased NOS2 antigen expression (immunoblot) (67) . When MNC from patients with RA were cultured with IFN-,y, they had increased production of nitrite/nitrate, whereas those of normal subjects were not altered. NMMA inhibited the NOS activity. Levels of NOS2 enzyme activity and NOS2 antigen in freshly isolated MNC were positively correlated with the severity of arthritis. Wang et al. noted that monocytes and pleural and peritoneal macrophages produced nitrite after in vitro LPS treatment (68) . Tissue macrophages from patients with malignancy produced more nitrite than did those from normal individuals. Amin et al. showed that normal monocytes did not express NOS2 antigen or have NOS enzymatic activity (69) . However, using RT-PCR, they demonstrated that monocytes expressed NOS2 mRNA. NOS2 mRNA could also be detected by northern blot in monocytes and U937 cells.",

In rodent macrophages, exogenous IFN-a cannot activate macrophages for NO production (73), but macrophage-synthesized IFN-a can augment NO production in an autocrine fashion (74 (76) . In those patients with hepatitis C receiving IFN-a, the degree of induction of NOS2 correlated significantly with the degree of improvement of their hepatitis. These investigators speculated that enhanced NO production induced by IFN-a or IFN-f3 might account for the development of \"autoimmune\" illnesses with inflammation similar to rheumatoid arthritis and systemic erythematosus noted in some patients who were treated with IFN-a or IFN-f3 (77, 78) . The work of Sharara and colleagues (76) (80) . Subjects could be divided into \"low-producers\" and \"high-producers\"; IL-4 augmented nitrite production by cells from \"low producers,\" while it decreased production by cells from \"high producers.\" Allergic subjects appeared to have increased production (80 (83) , that NMMA blocked IL-4-induced increased in IL-4 and soluble CD2 3 (sCD2 3) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (84) , and that IL-4, sCD23, and IFN-,y induced nitrite and L-citrulline production by monocytes (85) . Dugas and co-workers found that NMMA caused inhibition of anti-CD23 antibody-induced IL-10 expression by monocytes (86) . Vouldoukis et al. showed that engagement of CD23 with IgE immune complexes or anti-CD23 antibody caused an increase in nitrite formation and Leishmania killing (87) . IgE immune complexes, anti-CD23 antibody, and IFN-'y enhanced nitrite formation and the ability of cell lysates to convert L-arginine to L-citrulline. While IL-4 treatment had little or no effect on NOS2 mRNA expression in the monocytes, sequential treatment with IL-4 and anti-CD23 caused expression of NOS2. In general, the abilities to express/produce NOS/NO correlated with abilities to kill parasites (87) . Although added TNF did not enhance nitrite formation or Leishmania killing, anti-TNF antibody inhibited NO production and parasite killing; this suggested that endogenously produced TNF was important in this process.",

However, LPS, IFN--y, and TNF had no effect on nitrite formation, and virulent strains of M. tuberculosis or avirulent M. avium also had no effect.

Belenky et al. did not measure NO production, but they did demonstrate that L-arginine analogues attenuated the chemotactic peptide fMLP-induced chemotaxis and fMLP-induced increases in cAMP in human monocytes, suggesting indirectly that NO production by these cells modulated their function (96) . De Maria et al. found that treatment of monocytes with an antibody against the activation antigen CD69 antibody would trigger production of nitrite and nitrate (97) . The antibody enhanced monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity for tumor cells, and this toxicity was inhibited by NMMA. The nitrite production was inhibited by NMMA. Perez-Mediavilla et al. found that oligopeptides from certain extracellular matrix proteins enhanced nitrite production and NOS2 protein expression by human monocytes (98) . Production of nitrite was inhibited by NMMA. McLachlan and others noted that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) stimulated nitrite formation by normal human monocytes (99) . Nitrite production was higher in cells treated with both LPS and DHEA. By using an NO-specific amperometric probe, Magazine and co-workers demonstrated that morphine enhanced monocyte NO formation (100) . The NO production rate was rapid, with enhanced NO elaboration being detected within minutes of adding morphine to the cultures. Increased NO production was blocked by naloxone or by NMMA. NO production was also associated with cellular shape changes. Aymerich and colleagues showed that in vitro treatment of human monocytes with 13-endorphin induced expression of NOS2 protein and enhanced nitrate production (101) . The induction of NOS2 was noted if a mixture of monocytes and lymphocytes was treated in vitro, but it was not noted if purified monocytes were treated with 3-endorphin. Stefano et al. found that normal human monocytes, when treated with the tetrahydrocannabinol derivative anandamide, produced NO (measured by a NO-specific amperimetric probe) (102) . NO production occurred rapidly (within minutes of treatment), and Larginine analogues inhibited production. The cannabinoid antagonist SR 141716A (but not the morphine receptor antagonist naloxone) also blocked the NO-inducing effect.",

In a comparable fashion, Criado-Jiminez and co-workers found that MNC from alcoholic subjects produced nitrite, and that alcoholic subjects with cirrhosis produced even higher levels (106) . The nitrite production was inhibited by L-arginine analogues. Likewise, Laffi et al. found that monocytes from patients with alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites spontaneously converted L-arginine to L-citrulline and inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (107) .

Sharara and associates studied MNC from individuals with hepatitis C who were or were not being treated with IFN-a (76). Cells from hepatitis C patients not receiving IFN-a did not display NOS2 antigen or mRNA, and their NOS enzyme activities were comparable to those of normal individuals. In patients with hepatitis C, administration of IFN-a in vivo increased NOS enzyme activity and caused the appearance of NOS2 antigen and mRNA in MNC (Figs. 3 and  4) . In those patients receiving IFN-a, the degree of induction of NOS2 correlated significantly with the degree of improvement of their hepatitis. Treatment of mononuclear cells in vitro enhanced NO production, NOS activity, and NOS2 protein and mRNA expression, and this was accompanied by general improvement in the hepatitis (75) (Fig. 2) . In a different study, Majano and associates, using immunohistology and in situ hybridization, studied liver biopsy material from patients with chronic active hepatitis B or C, alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestasis (109) .

Although tissue from patients without lung injury contained small amounts of nitrotyrosine, there was two times more in those from patients with acute lung injury. The presence of nitrotyrosine was presumptive evidence that NO had been formed and had reacted with superoxide to form peroxynitrite; peroxynitrite then caused nitration of tyrosine (23) .",

Nicholson et al. found that alveolar macrophages from patients with tuberculosis expressed NOS2 antigen (immunocytology and immunoblot using a highly specific antibody for human NOS2) and mRNA (RT-PCR) (118) . Sixty-five percent of alveolar macrophages from 11 / 1 patients with untreated tuberculosis expressed NOS2, but only 10% of alveolar macrophages from five normal subjects expressed the antigen. Alveolar macrophages from patients with other inflammatory disorders such as pneumonia, cancer, and sarcoidosis also contained NOS2. Tunctan and co-workers noted that blood monocytes from normal subjects produced increased lev-579 els of nitrite after treatment with LPS in vitro (nitrate levels were not measured). Monocytes from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis did not produce increased levels of nitrite after LPS treatment (119) . They concluded that monocyte NO production was reduced in tuberculosis patients. However, using a bioassay for NO (methylene blueinhibitable relaxation of constricted guinea pig aorta smooth muscle by supernatant medium from cultures), the researchers noted that fluids from LPS-treated cultures of monocytes from controls or tuberculosis patients caused more relaxation (119) .",

In atherosclerotic vessels, there was decreased in NOS3 over the lesions and increased expression of NOS 1 and NOS2 in a variety of cells, including macrophages.

            "text": "Rheumatologic Disease There are numerous reports regarding the proinflammatory effects of NO in animal models of arthritis (see ref. 3 for review). There is also excellent information showing that in mononuclear phagocytes there is enhanced expression of NOS2 and increased production of NO in inflam-matory arthritis in humans. In a study of human synovial cells from patients with inflammatory arthritides, Sakurai et al. showed that synovial macrophages produced nitrite, contained NOS2 antigen (immunohistology and immunoblot), and expressed NOS2 mRNA (128) . NO production was inhibited by L-arginine analogues. The NOS2 expression and nitrite production were noted in both RA and inflammatory osteoarthritis. McInnes et al. studied synovial membrane cells from patients with osteoarthritis and RA ( 129) . They found increased nitrite production in cultures of these tissues, and noted that synovial macrophages expressed NOS2. However, the most abundant cells expressing NOS2 were synovial fibroblasts. Other researchers noted in immunohistology studies of resected joint specimens that RA patients had large numbers of CD68+ macrophages in the synovial lining areas that contained NOS2 (130) . Chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells also contained small amount of NOS2. Tissues from osteoarthritis patients had less NOS2 expression, and tissue from patients without arthritis (hip fracture) had no NOS2 expression (130) . St. Clair and associates found that freshly isolated monocytes and MNC from patients with active RA (when compared with those of normal subjects) had increased NOS enzyme activity and increased NOS2 antigen expression (immunoblot) (67) (Fig. 5) . When MNC were cultured with IFN-,y, they had increased production of nitrite/nitrate whereas those of normal subjects were not altered. NMMA inhibited the NOS activity. Levels of NOS2 enzyme activity and NOS2 antigen were positively correlated with the severity of arthritis. Investigators of this group also studied RA patients receiving treatment with the chimeric, monoclonal anti-tumor necrosis factora antibody cA2 (131) . This antibody has been found to induce dramatic improvement in arthritis in the majority of RA patients treated. Perkins and associates confirmed the increased blood MNC expression of NOS enzyme and NOS2 antigen in RA. They found that cells from patients who had received anti-TNF antibody treatment 4 weeks earlier had a decrease in the overexpression of MNC NOS2 antigen (Fig. 6) and NOS activity. Antibody-induced changes in NOS activity and NOS2 antigen expression correlated significantly with changes in the number of tender joints (greater improvement in arthritis induced by the antibody correlated with greater reduction in NOS) (Fig. 7) . They speculated that antibody-induced decreases in NOS overexpres-sion might account (wholly or in part) for the treatment-related clinical improvement in arthritis (131) . This study is unique in that the work documents that the degree of pharmacologic inhibition of NOS2 expression in human blood mononuclear cells correlates significantly with the agent-induced clinical improvement.",

They found that urine and plasma levels of nitrite/nitrate (corrected for renal function impairment) correlated inversely with disease severity, with highest levels in subclinical infection and lowest in fatal cerebral malaria. Likewise, blood MNC NOS2 antigen was detectable by immunoblot in all control children and in all those with subclinical infection, but it was undetectable in all but one subject with cerebral malaria. Quantitated MNC NOS2 antigen levels paralleled plasma nitrite/ nitrate levels, and they were inversely related to disease severity. Levels of IL-10, a cytokine known to suppress NO synthesis, increased with disease severity (138) . The authors hypothesized that high levels of IL-10 in severe disease might decrease NOS expression and NO production. On the basis of their data, they also suggested that NO had a protective (rather than a pathological) role in African children with malaria. It is important to note that the healthy control African children of this study had constitutive expression of MNC NOS2 and relatively high levels of plasma and urine nitrite/nitrate (138) . Studies (66) . They also found that kidney biopsy samples from these patients contained NOS2 mRNA, as determined by RT-PCR. Normal kidney samples expressed neither NOS2 antigen nor mRNA.

Using immunohistology and in situ hybridization techniques, they noted expression of NOS3 in glomerular endothelial cells and cortical vessel endothelium in both diseased and normal kidneys. There was no or little expression of NOS2 protein in kidneys from controls and patients with membranous nephropathy and minimal change nephrotic syndrome, but NOS2 was expressed strongly in mesangial cells and glomerular epithelial cells in kidneys from patients with IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis. From studies with the anti-macrophage antibody anti-CD68, they concluded that while some macrophages expressed NOS2, the majority of NOS2containing cells were intrinsic glomerular cells (mesangial cells and clomerular epithelial cells). There were inverse levels of expression of NOS3 and NOS2 in the kidneys, and in IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis, the extent of staining for NOS3 correlated negatively with the degree of glomerular pathology while that of NOS2 correlated positively with the degree of injury (139) .",

NOS2 was also seen in syncytiotrophoblast and vascular endothelium in some cases. RT-PCR analysis of placental samples showed the presence of NOS2 mRNA. Zarlingo and co-workers showed NOS2 staining in placental villous stomal macrophages of humans and other species (149) . They noted NOS2 in placental syncytiotrophoblasts and in vascular endothelial cells. In studies of human fetal membranes, Eis et al. demonstrated NOS2 in decidual macrophages and other cell types (150) . The intensity of NOS2 staining was greater in membranes of those with preterm labor as compared to those with no labor. There was no NOS2 staining in amnion epithelium or chorion trophoblast.",

However, they did measure any NO parameters. Lopez-Moratalla et al. noted that Grave's disease patients spontaneously expressed NOS2 antigen in freshly isolated monocytes (152) . Monocyte NOS2 antigen content was further increased by treatment of the cells in vitro with peptides from certain thyroid autoantigens (thyrotropin receptor, thyroid peroxidase, and thyroglobulin). Kim et al. noted that monocytes from patients with trauma produced more NO after in vitro LPS treatment than did those of normal individuals (153) . This NO production was decreased by treatment with IL-3 in vitro. Dias-Da-Motta et al. showed that PBMC from patients with sickle cell anemia produced NO that detectable in assays of platelet aggregation inhibition only in the presence of SOD (154) . However, this activity was not different than that noted in comparable cells from normal individuals.",

It is difficult to quantitatively compare levels of NO production and NOS2 expression by human and murine mononuclear phagocytes. However, based on several studies in which both murine and human cells were examined in parallel using the same conditions in vitro, human cells probably produce less NO and express lower levels of NOS2 than do murine cells. It is important to note that studies have shown that monocytes and tissue macrophages isolated from ill patients (e.g., those with rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, and malaria) display higher levels of NOS2, generate higher levels of NO in vitro, and respond better to in vitro activation by cytokines than do cells of normal donors. This suggests that there is an \"activating\" factor(s) or condition to which human mononuclear phagocytes are exposed in vivo that investigators cannot fully reproduce in in vitro cultures.",

Pharmacological modulation of mononuclear phagocyte NO production will likely be a useful therapeutic option in certain disease states.",

(A) NOS activity in freshly isolated and cultured mononuclear cells from control subjects and RA patients. Blood mononuclear cells were prepared and extracts from freshly isolated cells (\"fresh\") or from cells cultured 5 days with no additions, with 1 ,ug/ml LPS alone, with 500 U/ml IFN-y alone, or with 500 U/ml IFN-,y and 1 ,ug/ml LPS were assayed for NOS activity (ability to convert L-arginine to L-citrulline). Assays were done as six replicates for each individual subject. Results are shown as medians (horizontal bar), means (circle), the interquartile range (box), and the 10th to 90th percentile range (vertical lines). There were 20 control subjects and 25 RA patients. Using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, RA patients' NOS activities differed significantly from control subjects' NOS activities in the categories Fresh (p < 0.003), No additions (p < LPS/IFN-,y (p < 0.002). In analyses of cultured cells, the within-group comparison was significant for RA patients (p < 0.001), but not for control subjects. Pairwise comparisons for cells from RA patients revealed significant differences for treatments which included IFN--y [No additions vs. IFN-'y (p < 0.003), and No additions vs. LPS/IFN-,y (p < 0.003)].(B)   Nitrite/nitrate production by cultured mononuclear cells from normal subjects and RA patients. Blood mononuclear cells were prepared and cultured 5 days with no additions, 1 jig/ml LPS alone, 500 U/ml IFN--y alone, or 500 U/ml IFN-y and 1 ,tg/ml and associates noted high levels of NOS enzyme activity in tumor cells, but not in normal gynecological tissues(136). Irnnunohistology showed that NOS2 antigen was in tumor cells, but notin nonnal tissue. Other workers showed that central nervous tumors (astrocytoma, meningioma, Schwannoma, ependymoma, medulloblastoma, and mixed glioma) had NOS activity and expressed NOS1 and NOS2. In general, the highest levels of expression were in the tumors with the highest LPS. Supernatant media were then measured for nitrite/nitrate. Assays were done as six replicates for each individual subject. Results are shown as medians (horizontal bar), means (circle), the interquartile range (box), and the 10th to 90th percentile range (vertical lines). There were 20 control subjects and 25 RA patients. Using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, RA patients' nitrite/nitrate levels differed significantly from control subjects' nitrite/nitrate levels in the categories LPS (p < 0.01) and LPS + IFN-y (p < 0.02). Within-group comparison was significant for control subjects (p < 0.02), but not for RA patients. Pairwise comparisons for cells from control subjects revealed significant differences for No additions vs. LPS (p < 0.02) and \"LPS\" vs. IFN--y (p < 0.003). (C) Immunoblot analysis of mononuclear cells from normal controls and RA patients for NOS2 expression. Blood mononuclear cells were isolated and extracts were analyzed for NOS2 antigen content using an NOS2-specific mouse monoclonal anti-NOS2 antibody. The NOS2 antigen has a molecular weight of approximately 130 kD. Extracts from the murine macrophage cell line cells J774 and RAW 264 were used as negative and positive controls. Forty micrograms of protein from the extracts were used in each lane. Parallel gels and blots done using isotype-specific control immunoglobulin showed no reactivity. J = J774 control; J+ = J774 cells cultured with LPS + IFN-,y; r+ = RAW 264 cells cultured with LPS + IFN--y; RI-5 = samples from 5 separate RA patients; NI-5 = samples from 5 separate normal (control) subjects.
