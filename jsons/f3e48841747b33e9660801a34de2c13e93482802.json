To rescue PIV5, cells are infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7.3) and then transfected with the PIV5 molecular clone along with helper plasmids encoding NP, P, and L genes. Viral RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase is encapsidated with NP and associates with the polymerase complex, composed of P and L. The polymerase complex transcribes and replicates the genome, and progeny can be used in place of vTF7.3-infected cells. 25 Another approach, which we prefer to use in our laboratory, involves construction of a eukaryotic plasmid expressingT7 RNA polymerase that is cotransfected with the PIV5 infectious clone plasmid and NP, P, L-encoding plasmids ( Figure 1C ).

It was found that serum neutralizing antibodies were generated in PIV5/F-immunized mice but not in PIV5/G-immunized mice. Despite this, reduced viral burden was found in the lungs of PIV5/G-immunized mice presumably because RSV G-specific antibodies are protective independent of conventional neutralization activity in vitro.

Therefore, there is no concern for virulence reversion or residual virulence for PIV5 when used as a vaccine vector, unlike with some live-attenuated pathogen vectors. 27 There is concern that expressing a foreign viral envelope protein using a vaccine vector may expand tropism or pathogenicity of the viral vector. Thus far, there is no evidence indicating that this has occurred in PIV5 vaccine research. For example, a PIV5 vaccine expressing influenza virus HA protein (PIV5-H3) has been tested in nude mice to address the issue of potentially enhanced pathogenicity. 38 There were no signs of illness or weight loss observed in these immune-deficient mice when they were infected with PIV5 or PIV5-H3.

This flexibility is important when there are special requirements for virus stock production. The recombinant PIV5 viruses can be rescued efficiently from both approaches and directly used in further research without the need to remove vaccinia virus.When rescuing recombinant PIV5 viruses expressing foreign genes using the reverse genetics system, it is critical to insert the foreign genes into PIV5 genome strategically. Generally, the foreign genes are inserted into PIV5 noncoding region as an additional transcriptional unit, including the GS sequence, the foreign gene, and the GE sequence. In our laboratory, the foreign gene is routinely inserted between the 3\u2032 end of upstream gene and the gene junction sequences. Using this strategy, one only needs to artificially insert a gene junction sequence between 3\u2032 end of upstream gene and foreign gene. The transcription of original upstream and downstream genes remains active, and the foreign gene transcriptional unit is functional in gene expression. As mentioned previously, the genome sequence of the recombinant PIV5 genome should adhere to the \"rule of six,\" which enables proper genome encapsidation and thereby maintains the integrity of the genome and efficient virus replication. The insertion site is another important factor to consider, because it impacts the foreign gene expression level and viral replication efficiency. In principle, the foreign gene is more abundantly expressed when it is closer to the 3\u2032 end of the virus genome. In the case of NDV expression vector, insertion of the foreign gene at the P/M intergenic site of virus genome is preferable for optimal foreign gene expression.26,27 An ideal insertion site for the foreign gene should balance virus replication and foreign gene expression and contain an optimized arrangement of gene junction sequences before and after the foreign gene.4 | ADVANTAGES OF PIV5 AS A VACCINE VECTORParainfluenza virus 5 is a good candidate for the development of viral vectored vaccines because of its safety, genomic stability, and abilities Schematic diagram of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) genomes and virus rescue. A, PIV5 virion. The purified PIV5 virions were treated with anti-PIV5 HN antibody and then secondary antibody was labeled with gold particles (black dots). The samples were examined under the electron microscope. B, PIV5 genome organization and transcription scheme. NP, nucleoprotein; V, V protein; P, phosphoprotein; M, matrix protein; F, fusion protein; SH, small hydrophobic protein; HN, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein; L, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; GOI, gene of interest. The cis-acting transcription stop, intergenic, and transcription start signals (not shown) are included in the intergenic junctions between each gene. The polar mechanism of PIV5 genome transcription generates a gradient of viral mRNAs abundance that reduces from the 3\u2032 end of the genome toward the 5\u2032 end. C, Plasmid-based recovery of recombinant PIV5. BHK21 cells are cotransfected with the anti-PIV5 genome plasmid and expression plasmids encoding T7 RNA polymerase and the N, P, and L proteins of PIV5. Rescued recombinant PIV5 is used to infect BHK21 cells for purification of virus plaques. The plaque-purified viruses are further grown in the MDBK cells for virus stock of high titer. The pNP, P, and L (PIV5) refer to support plasmids that express the PIV5 NP, P, and L proteins, respectively; the pPIV5-GOI is the PIV5 infectious clone plasmid expressing gene of interest, while the PIV5-GOI means the rescued recombinant PIV5 virus; the pT7 Pol is the expression plasmid encoding T7 , thereby avoiding the risk of genetic modification of host cell DNA by recombination or insertion. Furthermore, although PIV5 can infect many animal species, there is thus far no sufficient evidence indicating that PIV5 causes disease in any animal species or even in humans. Therefore, the PIV5 is thought to be a relatively safe vaccine vector, which is advantageous over other negative-sense single-stranded virus vectors developed from RABV, vesicular stomatitis virus, and NDV, 27-31 which encounter issues with virus reversion, residual virulence, etc. (2) The PIV5 genome harboring a foreign gene is relatively stable. It does not have issues with genome recombination and the loss of the foreign gene as frequently happens with positive-stand RNA virus genomes. 32,33 Remarkably, PIV5 maintained expression of the GFP gene for over 10 generations in cell culture. 24 In addition, PIV5 stably retained foreign genes from RSV 34 after in vitro and in vivo passage. (3) Parainfluenza virus 5 infects a wide range of cell types, including primary human cells and established human cell lines. Parainfluenza virus 5 also infects a large number of mammals without causing any illness. 2,35,36 Vero cells, a WHO-approved cell line for vaccine production, is an ideal cell substrate for propagating PIV5, with viral titers up to 8 \u00d7 10 8 PFU/mL. 37 Parainfluenza virus 5\u2032s ability to grow to such high titers makes it amenable to developing a mass-produced, cost-effective vaccine. Furthermore, PIV5 replication in the respiratory tract of animals offers an attractive route to deliver the vaccines where mucosal immunity is important for protection against pathogen infection. (4) Parainfluenza virus 5 virions are highly pleomorphic, with sizes ranging from 100 to 200 nm in diameter (Figure 1A). This structural versatility allows the PIV5 genome to accommodate foreign genes of various sizes, which is advantageous when using it as a vaccine vector. The maximum size for a gene inserted into PIV5 is unclear, but studies have shown that inserting genes 1500 to 2500 nt in length do not significantly affect PIV5 growth or virion integrity (unpublished data). Thus, the size of the PIV5 genome may not be tightly restricted by the virion structure.5 | PIV5-VECTORED VACCINES AGAINST HUMAN AND ANIMAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES5.1 | PIV5-vectored vaccine candidates for influenza virusesThe first foreign gene inserted into the PIV5 genome was the green fluorescent protein (GFP).24 Parainfluenza virus 5 expressing GFP (rPIV5-GFP) replicated to similar titers as the wild-type virus in cell lines without inhibition of virus growth or instability of the GFP gene insertion. This was the first proof-of-concept study confirming that the PIV5 could be used for foreign gene expression. The feasibility of using recombinant PIV5 as a vaccine vector has since been tested.The first example is expression of the HA gene of influenza A/ Udorn/72 (H3N2 subtype) virus at the gene junction between the HN and L genes of PIV5 (rPIV5-H3).38 Interestingly, the HA was not only expressed in the virus-infected cells but also incorporated into the rPIV5-H3 virions. Infection and replication of rPIV5-H3 in mice did not cause any clinical signs of disease or weight loss when com-", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "gest HA-specific antibody and cell-mediated responses and demonstrated superior protection against lethal H5N1 challenge in mice. The results suggest that modification of PIV5's ability to antagonize host cell apoptosis may enhance the immunogenicity of foreign antigens.5.2 | PIV5 as a vaccine and a therapeutic for RABVCurrently, there are rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin therapies available for humans and animals against RABV infection (stray dogs and other wild animals, with the aim of reducing the public health risk to humans and domestic animals.To address these issues, recombinant PIV5 encoding the G gene of RABV (PIV5-G) was generated to evaluate its potential as a rabies vaccine. PIV5-G induced protective immune responses via intranasal, intramuscular, and oral immunization against a robust RABV challenge in mice.40 This is the first demonstration of an efficacious oral immunization for a paramyxovirus-vectored rabies vaccine. It aligns with a needle-free vaccination strategy to protect stray dogs and wild animals from rabies. Furthermore, since live PIV5 has been used extensively indogs as a component of the kennel cough vaccine, it is feasible for PIV5-G to replace PIV5 in the routine vaccination schedule for dogs. Further studies were performed to investigate the efficacy of PIV5-G as a post-exposure therapy for RABV infection. Mice were intramuscularly infected with RABV, which commonly reaches the animal's brain 3 days after exposure. 51 At 4, 5, and 6 days after RABV infection, mice were injected intracerebrally with PIV5-G or LBNSE-GM-CSF (an attenuated RABV expressing GM-CSF). Fifty percent of the PIV5-G-treated mice survived, even after the onset of clinical signs on day 6 post-RABV infection. PIV5-G was as effective as LBNSE-GM-CSF in treating RABV-infected mice. To improve the efficacy of PIV5-G, a combined therapy of PIV5-G and anti-rabies antibodies is worthy of further investigation. Unlike an attenuated RABV vaccine,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "RSV-F was inserted at the PIV5 SH-HN gene junction (PIV5-RSV-F/SH-HN) or used to replace PIV5 SH (PIV5\u25b3SH-RSV-F), based on previous findings that the vector modifications could increase vaccine efficacy. Parainfluenza virus 5 was also engineered to express a stabilized pre-fusion RSV-F (RSV-pF) at both insertion sites of PIV5, which has potential to generate more potent neutralizing responses to RSV than the RSV-F in the post-fusion conformation. Although the vaccine candidates stimulated strong host immune responses and RSV burden in the upper and lower respiratory tracts were reduced, RSV-pF did not generate a higher level of neutralizing antibodies than RSV-F. The findings suggest that both pre-fusion and post-fusion RSV-F are important and should be considered when designing highly efficacious recombinant RSV vaccines. It was also demonstrated that PIV5-based RSV vaccines could be administered subcutaneously, which provides a favorable route of vaccination for infants who may suffer from nasal congestion due to intranasal inoculation. 5.4 | PIV5 as a vaccine for tuberculosis Parainfluenza virus 5 has also been engineered to express bacterial antigens for vaccine development. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB), which is one of the main causes of disability and death worldwide. BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, is the only available TB vaccine, despite questions regarding its variable effectiveness against pulmonary TB in adults. Parainfluenza virus 5 was used to express Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens 85A (PIV5-85A) and 85B (PIV5-85B), and their immunogenicity and long-term protective efficacy were evaluated in a mouse aerosol infection model. 55 PIV5-85A and PIV5-85B effectively in reduced bacterial burden in the lungs. They could also boost the efficacy of BCG primary immunization, improving results by as much as a 3-log reduction in bacterial load. This is the first time a PIV5-vectored vaccine has been shown to boost vaccine efficacy in a heterologous prime-boost regimen.

Determining where to insert foreign genes into the PIV5 genome is valuable for PIV5 vaccine research.influenza vaccine antigen. Studies have shown that antigenic variation in NA is lower than in HA, and NA antibodies provide a broader range of protective immunity. Therefore, PIV5 viruses expressing NA of avian (H5N1) or pandemic (H1N1) influenza viruses were investigated. The results show that they can confer protection against homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenge in mice.47 In the case of PIV5 expressing NA of H5N1, two vaccine doses even conferred sterilizing immunity against H5N1 infection in mice.47 Both vaccines were also able to reduce clinical signs of disease and influenza virus shedding in ferrets. This study indicates that PIV5 expressing NA has the potential to be exploited as a universal influenza vaccine.
