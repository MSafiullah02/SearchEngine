The most common cause of acute bronchitis is influenza, with a much smaller percentage of acute bronchitis cases resulting from bacterial infection. Chlamydia pneumoniae has been responsible for several recent outbreaks, particularly in young adults. Bordetella pertussis may cause atypical symptoms resulting in prolonged cases of acute bronchitis in previously immunized adults. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an additional established etiologic agent of acute bronchitis. There is very little evidence that acute bronchitis may be caused by bacterial species that are characteristic of pneumonia infections (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae). Chronic bronchitis most frequently develops in tobacco smokers, approximately 30-50% of whom eventually show symptoms of this disorder Viegi (2001). Passive exposure to smoke can also contribute to the development of chronic bronchitis. Other causative factors include exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution, occupational dusts (e.g., grain, coal), or chemical irritants (e.g., sulfur dioxide). Chronic bronchitis may also develop in people with a history of recurrent lung infections or airway hyperresponsiveness Hogg (1999). Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are commonly associated with influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, or rhinovirus infections McCrory et al (2001). Elevated levels of particulate air pollution and ozone are also associated with acute exacerbations. The role of bacterial infection in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis remains controversial. Pathogenic bacterial such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are present in the sputum of approximately half of all those experiencing acute exacerbations but are also frequently present during periods of stable disease Hirschmann (2000). Clinical trials have shown that antibiotic therapy is helpful in 40% or less of those with acute exacerbations. However, in the subset of exacerbations in which purulent sputum is a predominant feature, the extent of bacterial eradication correlates with the degree of resolution of the exacerbation and its associated inflammation White et al (2003). Thus, an increase in bacterial load, acquisition of a new bacterial pathogen, or a change in the antigenic makeup of the resident bacterial population, may be responsible for certain acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The role of bacterial infection in the progression of chronic bronchitis is unclear Wilson (1998).",
