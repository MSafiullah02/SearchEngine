Lipids of biological membranes, especially, those in the spinal cord and brain containing highly oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids are affected (Braughler and Hall, 1989). Reactive oxygen mediated modification of DNA, proteins, lipids and small cellular molecules is associated with a number of pathological processes including atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, cataractogenesis, muscular dystrophy, pulmonary dysfunction, inflammatory disorders, tissue damage and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Frlich and Riederer, 1995). The term of the antioxidant is defined as any substance which delays or inhibits oxidation of the substrate (Halliwell and Gutterridge, 1989). This may be illustrated by considering one of the many mechanisms by which oxidative stress can cause damage by stimulating the free radical chain reaction of lipid peroxidation.",

            "text": "The ethanobotanical use of Crinum as with many other medicinal plants can be explained on the basis of chemical and physiological studies. Most cases confirm the therapeutic value of the plants. However, where plants have been studied chemically a plant potential pharmaceutical value can be assumed, if it is used widely (Githens, 1949). The reason why Crinum is used for medicinal purposes in many countries for similar reason is possibly due to their alkaloid constituents (Waller and Nowacki, 1978). Lycorine is a natural alkaloid extracted from amaryllidaceae and it has various pharmacological and microbiological effects. Researchers had revealed that lycorine can inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells (Jimenez et al., 1976) and acetylcholinesterase activity (Hohmann et al., 2002). In the presence of calprotectin lycorine was shown to inhibit protein synthesis and cell apoptosis in MM46 cells (Elgorashi et al., 2004). Lycorine was found to posess potent antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (Li et al., 2005). Lycorine could effectively arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells (Liu et al., 2004). The present investigation is an endeavor to validate the scientific use of ethanolic extract of Crinum\nasiaticum (L) and lycorine against 2-amidinopropane induced oxidative damage in human erythrocytes.",

Since the generation rate of free radical from the decomposition of AAPH at physiological temperature can be easily controlled, this water soluble azo compound can be used as free radical resource to attack the erythrocyte membrane to induce hemolysis.

Similarly, our present result shows the ethanolic extract C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine would prevent the erythrocyte damage by AAPH induced lipid peroxidation. The AAPH induced lipid peroxidation of erythrocytes is reflected in the MDA generation that occurs with the addition of ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine.

In the present study, normal human erythrocytes incubate with 25 mM APPH for 1 h resulted in loss of GSH. However, erythrocytes treated with ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine were reverted to the reduced level of GSH when compared with APPH induced erythrocytes. Several workers have suggested that GSH provides the first line of defense during oxidative insult (Vissers and Winterbourne, 1995). In the presence of free radicals, mainly H2O2, GSH acts as an electron donor and is oxidized into GSSG by glutathione peroxidase. The GSSG generated is later converted back to GSH by glutathione reductase in which reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is the hydrogen donor. When cellular GSSG levels increase during oxidative stress, GSSG is exported into extracellular fluid to avoid thiol toxicity. In the AAPH-induced erythrocytes hemolysis shows the rapid depletion of GSH that might be caused by oxidation processes taking place in erythrocyte membranes. The resultant lipid peroxides might also react with GSH and that led to a decrease in GSH, it means increase in GSSG. If GSSG accumulates within the cell, it can form protein glutathione adducts via reversible thiol exchange reactions referred to as S-glutathionylation of protein. Protein S-glutathionylation has been implicated in the buffering of oxidative stress, stabilization of extracellular proteins, protection of proteins against irreversible oxidation of critical cysteine residues, and regulation of enzyme activity. Glutathionylated proteins are more stable than GSSG and less prone to enzymatic reduction by glutathione reductase (Tables 3 and 4).",
