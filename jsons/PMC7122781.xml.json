Marrying the two includes, succinctly, safety within physical and territorial borders, economic conditions which enable the population to secure livelihoods and political organization according to a rule-based system.3 States also take into account the positions and pressures of external actors, both local and international, which may seek influence over policies, eroding the decision-making room of the state itself.\nThe importance of sovereign independence is often overlooked by overseas policy makers. Independence is hugely prized in countries that were under colonial rule just a generation or two ago.

It was arguably also the case when Indonesia invoked its \u201cviral sovereignty,\u201d though in that instance it was as much to deny external patenting and the subsequent need to purchase any (for Indonesia) unaffordable vaccine based on viral sequencing.

As he sketches it, a fire brigade boasts numerous operationally coordinated elements. These are organized vertically and include: one\u2014pre-determined, published\u2014telephone number to be called for immediate help; a recognized leader, in the person of a chief fire officer giving orders that are followed; a working fire engine with hoses; adaptability to prevalent fire hydrants with adequate water flow. In Krech\u2019s rendering, however, the WHO\u2019s fire-fighting, or outbreak intervention is hindered at nearly every one of these response levels:\nThere is not one number to call for immediate help. Instead, both member states, and (eventually) the WHO are the recipient of myriad calls (from (other) member states, the affected state itself, from NGOs on the ground, from NSAs, and social media actors).Then, instead of a chief fire officer arriving to give orders, both member states and the WHO are tasked with formulating and implementing a response. This is the equivalent instead of the chief fire officer coming to discuss how the member state could response to the disease outbreak itself.Assuming the member state is capable, it will likely respond to the outbreak with its own resources. If not, this hierarchy reduces it to begging the WHO to send assistance.This in turn leads to the WHO, made up of its member states, having itself to seek support\u2014operational and financial\u2014to respond. It translates roughly into preparing the fire engine to come, while having to go house-to-house to collect water (funding). Furthermore, administrative incompatibilities may also hamper water flow as hoses are not compatible with either buckets or existing fire hydrants.Finally, despite a member state\u2019s plea to the one WHO, it is possible that not just it, but ten other fire brigades\u2014the aforementioned other states, NGOs or NSAs\u2014try to respond: resulting in their crossing, keeping each other from reaching the burning house.25\n\n",

Under the application and accreditation rules, an increasing number of NGOs have gained consultative access at the United Nations, notably the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (ECOSOC). Currently 4,189 NGOs enjoy this status.32 That is a number which has risen exponentially since 1996, which coincidentally or not follows the 1994 UNDP report on human security, wherein health plays a prominent role. These NGOs, are not, however, granted decision-making powers. Nor do they have consultative status at the General Assembly or the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
