            "text": "In December, 2019, a series of human pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) that caused clusters of fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling SARS-CoV ([1], [2], [3]). COVID-19 started in China but now is present in many different countries with the highest number of cases in US, Italy and Spain among others. To better understand this new global epidemic from the environmental and health perspective I have decided to select the very recent papers published in the scientific literature and to prepare this Opinion Paper for JECE. Air compartment plays a key role in COVID-19 transmissions specially meteorological factors such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity and air pollution PM10, Black Carbon and NOx. But the presence and evolution of COVID-19 virus in other environmental compartment such as water, soils, wastewater and sewage sludge needs attention as well(4). Sewage can be used to determine the scale of COVID-19, the so-called Sewage Epidemiology or Waste Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach. In untreated waste water the virus causing COVID-19 (via feces introduced in waste water) can survive from hours to days. First data on COVID-19 in sewage in Europe was reported recently in the Netherlands, by RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Patients with COVID-19 in their gastrointestinal tract will thus excrete it in their feces. RIVM has previously used this approach to detect the presence of norovirus, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the poliovirus and the measles virus in wastewater (5).Few weeks later COVID-19 virus was detected in sewage waters from Australia (6) and Paris, France (7). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 is generally carried out with nucleic acid \u2212 based polymerase chain reaction(PCR) assay, used for confirmation of COVID-19 patients around the globe. PCR has high sensitivity and specificity, requirements for complicated sample handling in the laboratory, skilled personnel, and a long period of data processing and analysis (4 \u2212 6 h).",

The most relevant finding is that there is no evidence supporting that case counts of COVID-19 decline with warmer weather. This is one of the few studies that does not find a decrease on COVID-19 outbreak when ambient temperature increases. Most of all other studies reported indicate just the contrary, warmer temperature should decrease COVID-19 outbreak. One reason could be that this study was performed in winter time, with lower temperatures than spring or summer period. In contrast Luo Bin et al (9) describe the effects of daily temperature and humidity on daily deaths of COVID-19 that took place in Wuhan during January-February this year that is the same period as with Zhou and Xie (8). In this case the findings indicate that increase of temperature and humidity had a positive effect and the number of COVID-19 deaths which decreased. Same effect was also noticed in Jakarta, Indonesia, from January-March 2020 (10). But in addition to the meteorological factor the very high mobility and high density of the people living in Jakarta, with around 9. 6 millions inhabitants, is a key factor for fast transmission of COVID-19.",

By contrast, O3 levels increased (+33 to +57% of the 8 h daily maxima), probably due to lower titration of O3 by NO and the decrease of NOx in a VOC-limited environment. In the same direction correlation between NO2 levels with COVID-19 outbreak analysis has been conducted on a regional scale and combined with the number of death cases taken from 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany (14).

Basic principle is that sewage can be used as indicator of the scale of infection and it will boost worldwide attention and interest in WBE. Daughton and many others we do believe that collective efforts of the WBE community need to be granted as recognition that they deserve in addressing ongoing, urgent needs of public health. The first data detecting COVID-19 in sewage from the Netherlands (5), Australia (6) and Paris, France (7) supports this idea of using WBE to reveal the scale of COVID-19 outbreak. Several other papers ([16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]) reported the importance to detect viruses in untreated wastewater samples and to develop paper sensor devices to measure directly in wastewaters.. These measurements were carried out using PCR, the most widely used method for COVID-19 detection. Paper-based devices are powerful and cheap tools for the rapid diagnosis of pathogens and determination infection of transmission (17). It contains different functional areas printed with a wax printer into a cheap paper material. The whole testing process using this paper-based device is very fast and sensitive, which overcomes the limitation of PCR and it was used for a variety of infections such as malaria and several pathogens (17).",

The last paper selected concerning the presence of viruses in wastewaters is also about the survival of two surrogate coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis in water(21). The authors did find out that these viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks. At 25 _C, time required for 99% reduction in reagent-grade water was 22 days for TGEV. At present we do not know if the same is applicable to COVID-19 and for how long it can remain in water. What we know from recent studies is that fecal transmission routes should be considered, as the COVID-19 virus has been positively detected in stool samples of infected patients. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV can survival in stool samples for 4 days (22) or even up 22 days, much longer than in respiratory (18 days) and serum samples (16 days) collected from patients of Zheijiang province hospital (23). In short, infected stools in wastewater can generate further transmission routes through aerosols formation during wastewater treatment.",

            "text": "Hospitals are key element to treat and recover patients infected with COVID-19. Disinfection techniques most appropriate for the rooms, personnel and medical equipment are required. An interesting study performed on indoor air quality at the largest hospital in Iran (24). The air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 was investigated last March 2020. Viral RNA was extracted and analyzed by PCR (RT-PCR). Fortunately, in this study all air samples which were collected 2 to 5 m from the patients\u2019 beds with confirmed COVID-19 were negative. The indoor air was not contaminated with the virus causing COVID-19. The authors suggested as well to perform in vivo experiments using actual patient cough, sneeze and breath aerosols in order to show the possibility of generation of the airborne size carrier aerosols and the viability fraction of the embedded virus in those carrier aerosols. Disinfection technologies at hospitals are certainly a key issue to avoid the large number of medical doctors and front-line healthcare workers (HCW)that is being continuously infected by COVID-19. Neil Rowan (25) presents a comprehensive insight into this pressing need with preference towards environmental-friendly sustainable disinfection technologies. This is needed too because of the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment (PPE). PPE are heat sensitive and are not, by their manufacturer\u2019s design, intended for reprocessing. Most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals, or in terminal medical device sterilization providers, cannot effectively reprocess PPE due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities. Eco-friendly technologies are being recommend and used in Ireland, namely vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), such as for filtering face piece respirators and UV irradiation. To be added that UV irradiation was already recommend for other disinfection applications including toilet flushing (26). Ultraviolet waveband C (UV-C) for disinfection was effective for the three types of bacteria studied: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. An excellent review and recommended reading on photocatalytic disinfection technologies for waterborne viruses was recently published last year (27).",

The source are infected humans and a risk-based approach/measure was applied: isolate the sources and/or cure the sources. The pathway it clear too: Covid-19 spreads via aerosols, sneezed our coughed out by infected humans. The virus thus gets direct to the receptor. Or sticks to all kinds of surfaces: plastics, stainless steel, etc. But stays only active for few hours-days. Finally the receptors are other humans and the risk-based approach is to isolate the receptors or make them immune by a vaccine, or move receptors away to an area with no source-pathway.",

Still one of the major challenges in SARSCoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol. WBE can help solving the pressing problem of insufficient diagnostic testing and it will provide a cheap and early warning method for COVID-19 outbreak. To make things crystal clear WBE will be complementary and not an alternative to the compulsory PCR detection of COVID-19 in humans. Papers reported up till now on other types of viruses indicate that different viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for 3-7 days to 2-3 weeks. Special attention needs to be paid to the aerosol formation during wastewater treatment. The key question would be to know for how long COVID-19 will survive in sewage remains open.",

I am aware that different research groups are already working on this direction being a perfect example the recent paper on the development of optomechanical spectrometry detection showed a promising solution towards the fast detection of label-free diagnosis of infectious diseases(32). In addition to the development of new detection methods, theoretical computational analysis has been recently reported as a way to identify active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. It was applied to the COVID-19 virus monitoring in Tempe, AZ, US as case study.

Protective measures for workers at places at high risk like hospitals and other medical care facilities is certainly more important and need to be in place. In Spain up till now 15% of the people infected by COVID-19 virus were medical doctors and hospital personnel.
