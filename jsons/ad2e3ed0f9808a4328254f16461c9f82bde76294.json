A further analysis reveals that the quality of life impairments of thse patients could be particularly due to the airflow obstruction and air trapping related to bronchiectasis. Objective: Early diagnosis and intervention of bronchial asthma in children are important, although no clinical method for objectively evaluating bronchial reactions in infants and young children are available. Breath sound parameters have been suggested as biomarkers of the airway narrowing in children. Using a commercially available breath sound analyzer, the characteristics of airway condition were investigated in infants with risk factors for asthma development.",

The breath sound parameters of the frequency limiting 99% of the power spectrum (F99), the roll-off from 600-1200 Hz (Slope) and spectrum curve indices, the total area under the curve of the dBm data (A3/AT) and the ratio of power and frequency at 50% and 75% of the highest frequency of the power spectrum (RPF75 and RPF50), were evaluated. Using an ATS-DLD based original Japanese questionnaire, we examined the characteristics of airway conditions of infants. Results: Altogether, 283 infants who had no history of acute respiratory infection were analyzed. The RPF75, RPF50, Slope and F99 in infants with positive results of allergy and atopic dermatitis were significantly more increased than those in the infants with a negative result. Conclusions: Our results show that the breath sounds of infants with risk factors of asthma development reveal residual airway changes, even in a healthy state. Breath sound analysis may be useful for assessing the airways of infants for asthma development. Introduction: Obesity and asthma are common disorders, and the prevalence of both has increased in recent decades. This study aims to recognize the correlation between body mass index (BMI) with clinical presentation and duration of hospitalization in children and adolescents diagnosed with asthma and admitted in a tertiary government hospital. General Objective: To determine the correlation of BMI with the number of symptoms (clinical presentation) and duration of hospitalization among children aged 5 to 18 years old admitted with a diagnosis of asthma. Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Subjects: Patients 5 to 18 years old admitted with a diagnosis of asthma from June 2015 to March 2016. Those with comorbidities of pneumonia, cardiac disease, tuberculosis and demise were excluded. Methodology: Weight and height were measured upon admission and plotted on the appropriate Center for Disease and Control (CDC) BMI-for-age growth chart for all included patients. Subjects were classified according to their Body Mass Index as Obese, Overweight, Normal/Healthy weight and Underweight. Symptoms and signs related to asthma were recorded upon admission. Date of discharge was determined from medical records and duration of hospitalization (days) was computed.",

A higher proportion of subjects (P value < 0.001) with higher number of asthma symptoms were noted among the obese and underweight groups. Significantly positive correlation coefficients of 0.415 (P value < 0.0001) between BMI and number of symptoms and 0.654 (P value < 0.0001) between BMI and duration of hospitalization were also noted.

Results: Total antibiotic use appeared to have decreased 1 year after follow-up in a specialized asthma clinic. Both the overall use (p 0.08) and the use of amoxycillin / clavulanate (p 0.01) were statistically significant. The use of amoxycillin, cephalosporins and macrolides was also found to be reduced.

Methods: In this prospective cross sectional study, we enrolled consecutive children between 5 to 15 years of age with poorly controlled asthma (partly controlled and uncontrolled as per GINA guidelines) between July 2016 to March 2018. We excluded children with cystic fibrosis. The enrolled children were investigated for ABPA that included total IgE, Aspergillus-specific IgE, Aspergillus-specific IgG, skin prick test for Aspergillus, serum precipitins, absolute eosinophil count (AEC), chest X-ray, and chest CT (in selected patients). ABPA was diagnosed as per recent criteria: if both of the following criteria were fulfilled: (1) total IgE > 1000 IU/ml and positive skin prick test (SPT) to Aspergillus or Aspergillus-specific IgE > 0.35 kUA/L; (2) at least of two of following three: presence of precipitating antibody or Aspergillus-specific IgG > 27 mg/L; chest radiology suggestive of ABPA; and total eosinophil count > 500 cells/mm3. Data were analyzed using STATA 12.0. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve along with area under the curve (AUC) to determine the utility of various parameters to differentiate children with ABPA from those without. To determine best cut-offs, Youden's index was used (sensitivity + specificity -1).",

In such cases, sirolimus which is an mTOR inhibitor, can be beneficial to patients who tend to be refractory and cannot be treated with lymphatic intervention or operation. Purpose: Specific genetic causes for childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) in immunocompetent patients have been identified within the past decade. However, little is known about the pathogenesis of many forms of chILD, and treatment approach has not been standardized. A national survey was carried out by the Japanese Society of Pediatric Pulmonology (JSPP) To identify the histopathology and response to current treatment, especially hydroxychloroquine, which is contraindicated for children younger than 6 years old in Japan.",

One center (14%) did not remove CPAM but instead performed follow-up on asymptomatic patients. Four infants used Precision flow: three used single prong cannula (tip OD1.9 mm), and the remaining infant used double prong, infant cannula (tip OD1.9 mm). Pharyngeal pressure tended to rise to flow rate dependence with any type of cannula. In patients managed with the Optiflow junior, the mean pharyngeal pressure at the flow rates of 1, 2, 3, and 4 L/kg/min for premature size cannula were 2.3, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.6 cmH2O, respectively, and for neonatal size cannula were 0.5, 1.9, 3.0, and 3.7 cmH2O, respectively.

Background: Even though it is considered as a screening test, sweat conductivity (SC) analysis seems to be an alternative diagnostic method to the coulometric quantitative test (CQT) for the diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). It is widely accepted that coulometry requires specialized technicians, in addition to being performed only in referral centers. On the other hand, SC sweat analysis is a semiautomated procedure, simpler and faster than the conventional CQT.",

Because of respiratory distress syndrome, endotracheal intubation was performed and the patient was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. After 3 months of mechanical ventilation support, the endotracheal tube was removed and the patient was treated under NIV support. After 9 months of mechanical ventilation support since birth, we decided to make an assessment of the neurodevelopment of the patient by brain MRI. Conclusion: Most of the time, preterm BPD infants with VD who are receiving NIV support will be considered as high risk and follow-up for MRI delayed because of two reasons: (1) need of oral intubation with endotracheal tube to guarantee the safety of the respiratory system; (2) The neonatal MRI-ventilator which includes NIV mode is too expensive and requires a well-trained respiratory therapist to operate the MRI-ventilator. We believed that once we well-prepared the MRI-ventilator, infants with VD who are receiving NIV support could undergo MRI more safely. By sharing this case experience, we hope the profession of neonatal respiratory therapy could receive more attention. We present two cases that were diagnosed after multiple consultations: Case 1. A 2-year-old girl presented with a history of recurrent episodes of cyanosis during her first months of life, worsening respiratory symptoms and poor exercise tolerance. She was assessed on several occasions by a general practitioner (GP) who did not consider that further investigations were necessary. She also had recurrent epistaxis and was being followed by the local ENT specialist who considered the episodes as normal. At the age of two, she was admitted to her local hospital with a LRTI, cyanosis and persistent low oxygen saturation levels (70%). She was treated with antibiotics, but given her slow improvement she was referred to our center for further workup. On examination, she presented with failure to thrive, general cyanosis, multiple telangiectasia in oral cavity and nostrils, and clubbing fingers. Initial chest X-ray showed ABSTRACTS | S139 CT Angiography revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the middle segment of the right lower pulmonary lobe, multiple intraparenchymal small AVMs in both lungs and an aberrant artery from the descending aorta that irrigated the right upper lobe.",

Compared with the non-OSA group, the OSA group had a higher Epworth sleepiness score (P = 0.03) and were more likely to snore (P = 0.01). The present study \"Comparative study of nebulized beta 2 agonist, nebulized adrenaline and any added advantage of 3 % hypertonic saline in bronchiolitis\" was undertaken to assess the efficacy. A total number of 150 patients (50 patients in each group) were examined below 24 months of age.

Pediatrics, University of Jordan -Amman, Jordan Objective: Asthma is caused by complex interactions of genetic and environmental factors. Vitamin D deficiency is being linked to an array of immunologically based diseases, one of which is asthma. The aim of this study is to assess the level of serum vitamin D in children with bronchial asthma and to correlate it with the severity of the condition. Additionally, we aim to determine whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with atopy and allergen sensitization in children with bronchial asthma. Methods: This study included 98 children with bronchial asthma, aged between 4 and 14 years. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin-D levels were determined. Severity of asthma was determined according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) assessment and the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Skin prick testing for inhaled allergen sensitization was also performed. Results: Our results showed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among asthmatic children. Vitamin D levels were deficient in 41.8% of asthmatic children and insufficient in 34.7%. Only 23.5% had sufficient vitamin D levels. The severity of asthma symptoms showed Our study clearly demonstrates the importance of verifying vitamin D levels in children with bronchial asthma. This could be a target for modifying treatment modalities and determining new risk factors for asthma development and severity in pediatrics. A-221 | Drug Use and Quality of Life in Asthmatic Children 1 Year before and after Admittance in an Outpatient Pediatric Asthma Clinic Karantaglis N., Kirvasillis F., Hatziagorou E., Kontouli K., Tsanakas J. Pediatric Pulmonology and CF Unit, 3rd Pediatric Dept, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki -Thessaloniki, Greece Purpose of the study: To compare quality of life and drug use in asthmatic children before and after their attendance in a specialized asthma clinic. Background: Asthma is the most common chronic condition during childhood. Despite this, asthma is often both overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed resulting in fragmented therapy, deterioration in quality of life as well as increased direct and indirect costs. Since 2014, and due to the financial crisis, the Greek state has introduced e-prescription as a tool for better control of pharmaceutical prescription and pharmaceutical expenditure. This platform, in which almost all Greek citizens are registered, provides the possibility of a documented assessment of the patient's medication use and allows estimations of direct pharmaceutical costs. Materials and Methods: Forty-six asthmatic children 7 to 14 years old, classified as step 3 or 4 according to GINA guidelines 2018. Antibiotic, antihistamine and nasal steroid use as well as quality of life (QoL) were measured in asthmatic children admitted to an outpatient pediatric asthma clinic of a tertiary care pediatric hospital, 1 year before and 1 year after. Quality of life (QoL) was measured with the DISABKIDS Questionnaire, which is a validated questionnaire, completed both by children and their parents. The measures used for the study were the DISABKIDS chronic generic measure (DCGM-37) and the DISABKIDS Condition-specific module for asthma. The DISABKIDS chronic generic module (DCGM-37) consists of 37 rating-scaled items assigned to six dimensions: Independence, Emotion, Social inclusion, Social exclusion, Limitation, and Treatment. These six dimensions can be combined to produce a general score for HRQoL. The condition-specific asthma questionnaire (DISABKIDS Asthma Module -17 questions) consists of two domains: the impact domain, concerning limitations and symptoms, and the worry domain, concerning worries related to asthma. In the study, both DISABKIDS self-report versions (child version) and proxy versions (completed by one of their parents) were used.",

Korea is a latecomer in lung transplantation, but the number of cases is gradually increasing since the first lung transplantation in a child was performed in 2011. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes and survival rate of children between the ages of 0 and 18 years who received a lung transplant at the Asan Medical Center between August 2011 and December 2018. A total of 14 children underwent lung transplantation. Results: The mean age of the lung transplant recipients was 11.1\u00b15.2 years (1.7-18.6 years), and 7 were male and 7 were female among the 14 children. Nine children underwent bilateral whole lung transplantation, 4 underwent bilateral lobar lung transplantation, 1 underwent right lobar lung and left whole lung transplantation, and there was one patient who received heart-lung transplantation. The reasons for lung transplantation were bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (5 of 14 patients, 35.7%), chemotherapy induced lung injury (2 of 14, 22.0%), cystic fibrosis (2 of 14, 14.3%), primary pulmonary hypertension (1 of 14, 7.1%), interstitial lung disease after HSCT (1 of 14, 7.1%), lung injury induced by humidifier disinfectant (1 of 14, 7.1%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (1 of 14, 7.1%), and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (1 of 14, 7.1%). Most patients received intensive care (9 of 14, 64.3%) including extracorporeal life support (6 of 14, 42.9%) before lung transplantation. Among the 14 children, only 2 patients died (14.3%), 1 patient died of fungal infection and 1 patient died of postoperative bleeding. In Korea, pulmonary complication after HSCT was the main cause of lung transplantation, unlike other countries. Although the follow-up period is not sufficient to evaluate late outcome of lung transplantation, early outcome of lung transplantation in Korea was comparable to the results from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. Lung transplantation can be an accepted treatment option for end stage lung disease in Korean children. D-198 | Effectiveness of Hypertonic Saline Nebulization Before Chest Physiotherapy in Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis -A RCT W. D. A Anuradha K. 1 , K. G Gunathilaka P. 1 , P Wickramasinghe V. 2 1 Pediatrics, Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children -Colombo, Sri Lanka; 2 Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo -Colombo, Sri Lanka Introduction: Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is a major contributor to the chronic respiratory morbidity in both developed and developing countries. Failure to expectorate mucus resulting in progressive airway damage is the hallmark of bronchiectasis which stresses the importance of airway clearance as the key step in its management. Multiple airway clearance techniques have been introduced although research in children is limited. Pre-medication with Hypertonic Saline (HS) nebulizations before airway clearance is an established method in managing bronchiectasis in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis in adults.",

A strong association reportedly exists between the pharyngeal pressure, measured as a substitute for the continuous positive airway pressure, and flow rate of HFNC. However, the influence of the differences in the devices and the cannulas used for HFNC on pharyngeal pressure has not been well verified. This study aimed to assess the pharyngeal pressure exerted by two commonly used HFNC devices: Optiflow junior and Precision flow in preterm infants. Method: Pharyngeal pressure was measured in 12 preterm infants receiving respiratory support with HFNC using the Optiflow junior or Precision flow at the neonatal intensive care unit of the Kurashiki Central Hospital and the Kakogawa Central City Hospital from 2016 to 2017. The flow rate gradually increased from 1 L/kg/min to 4 L/kg/min (maximal flow rate of 8 L/min), and the pharyngeal pressure was measured over 1 minute at each flow rate in a resting state with active mouth closure. The mean pharyngeal pressure value for 1 minute was defined as the pharyngeal pressure at that flow rate. Result: The median gestational age of the subjects was 28 weeks (range 24-29 weeks), and the median birth weight was 959 g (range 438-1602 g). At the time of measurement, the median corrected gestational age was 34.8 weeks (range 31.0-36.9), and the median weight was 1290 g (range 953-1932 g).

The structure of the dedicated circuit of each device and the outer diameter of the tip of the cannula may have affected the pharyngeal pressure.6 | CYSTIC FIBROSIS F-34 | Clinical Characteristics of Cystic Fibrosis in Japan Fukazawa M. 1 , Sato D. 2 , Koga H. 1 1 Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization, Beppu Medical Center -Beppu-city, Oita, Japan; 2 Pediatrics, Saiseikai Kawaguchi General Hospital -Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited multisystem disorder which causes exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in early life births in Japan, making the clinical features unclear and causing delays in diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical features of CF cases in Japan. Methods: We conducted a complete literature review of CF case reports in Japan between 1994 and 2015. Patients who did not meet the domestic diagnostic criteria or the report which did not contain sufficient data were excluded from the study. We investigated clinical features of 53 patients described in 44 case reports, including one patient of our own. Results: Among the 53 patients, 27 were male and 26 were female. 45 were Japanese and 7 had a foreign nationality. Four cases had consanguineous-marriage parents. The mean birth week was 37.6 weeks (\u00b13.6 weeks) and the average birth weight was 2,843g (\u00b1701g). The median age of diagnosis was 2.1 years (0 to 43 years). At the time of diagnosis, the mean weight and height were -3.0 \u00b1 2.0 SD and -2.0 \u00b1 0.9 SD, respectively. The most common symptom seen at the time of diagnosis was meconium ileus during the neonatal period (100%), failure to thrive during infancy (63%), and chronic respiratory symptoms among older generations (97%). Other features frequently seen were airway colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85%), airway colonization by Staphylococcus aureus (33%), hyponatremia or hypochloridemia (31%), and alkalosis (27%). A few cases had renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, fecal ileus, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Six cases required continuous home oxygen therapy, 2 of which eventually underwent lung transplantation. Liver transplantation was performed in one of 6 cases with liver cirrhosis. Responsible gene mutation, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation, was identified in 32 cases. Among 50 abnormal alleles, 36 alleles were identified in previous reports, but 14 alleles had never been described. Conclusion: Classic symptoms of CF are often seen in Japan because of the delay in diagnosis. The delay contributes to the poor weight gain of the patients at the moment of presentation. While clinical characteristics were similar to those of Caucasian populations, genotypes were somewhat different from other populations. Some patients had a completely new mutation whose pathogenesis is not proven. This might suggest difficulty of genetic diagnosis which is commonly done in other countries as a screening test in the early stage of one's life. CF should be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis for children with meconium ileus, poor weight gain, or chronic respiratory problems To diagnose early in Japan.",

Methods: This study was a retrospective review using data recorded in the University of Minnesota CF Database between 1995 and 2010. Respiratory culture results obtained during routine CF clinic encounters of two cohorts of pediatric and adult CF patients (preand post-separation) were analyzed for presence of P. aeruginosa. Results: The odds of a pediatric patient having P. aeruginosa were significantly less if the first culture was obtained after separation of pediatric and adult clinics. Being diagnosed by newborn screening or introduction of inhaled tobramycin did not affect this outcome. This reduction in P. aeruginosa was not detected in the adult cohort. Conclusions: Separation of pediatric and adult CF clinics has contributed to a decrease in P. aeruginosa prevalence in pediatric patients. F-82 | The Future Starts Today: An Update on The Role of Innovative Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches in Cystic Fibrosis Arets H. G. M. Pediatric Pulmonology, UMCU -Utrecht, Netherlands We live in a decade of rapidly changing and ever increasing methods for both diagnosis and treatment of children and adults with CF. In particular, the development and implementation of the so-called intestinal organoid (\"mini gut\") methodology has since 10 years shown to enable personalized functional diagnosis of the basic defect in the surface cells of CF patients, also discriminating between the more severe and milder function abnormalities (related to the different mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). And probably even more important, this enables the investigation of individual applicability of and responses to all the recently developed new medications, the so-called CFTR modulator therapy. This has made possible the important change from symptomatic treatment to preventive treatment leading to prevailed lung function and increased survival of CF patients. In this lecture, all of these important developments will be shortly addressed. At the end, the audience will be updated in conformity with 2019 standards!

Newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis (CF) is increasingly used and a tool for monitoring pulmonary disease at an early age is needed. We aimed to assess the feasibility and value of MBW as a clinical monitoring tool after decision to implement MBW in early infancy as a routine method. Method: All CF children diagnosed since NBS implementation in May 2016 were selected for MBW measurements at their routine outpatient visits. Infant MBW training sessions were conducted by experts. Within possibilities, MBW measurements (at least 2 acceptable runs) were obtained within 3 months of age and every 3 (\u00b11) months for 1 year. All children were sedated with dexmedetomidine and standardized MBW measurements were performed using the Exhalyzer D 3.2.1 system with sulfur hexaflouride (SF6) as tracer gas. Results: Thirteen infants with mean age (range) 10.5 months (1 -19 months) were included. At initial MBW measurement, the mean LCI (range) was 7.33 (6.19 -9.98). The CF infants were mainly below the upper limit of normal (ULN) LCI 7.72 (based on unpublished data on healthy infants). Three CF infants presented with an LCI above the ULN. We scheduled 43 MBW measurements, 39 of which were successfully obtained in sufficiently sedated children during routine outpatient visits. Three tests were cancelled due to clinical signs of lung infections and one due to insufficient sedation. All cancelled tests were rescheduled and performed within 2 to 4 weeks. MBW measurements were technically safe as no adverse events were observed. Criteria for technical acceptability was met in 39/39 (100%) tests. The time required for an acceptable test differed with a mean time (range) 15 minutes (7 -58). Two test occasions were not performed within the timeframe of 3 \u00b11 months, while all other tests were conducted within the scheduled timeframe during the 1-year implementation period. Conclusion: Our results indicate that longitudinal SF6 MBW is feasible for lung function testing in infants with CF from 3 months of age. Our experience showed that successful measurement required expert training of operators. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that intranasal Dexdor\u00ae is an effective and safe sedative for infant lung function testing. Value as a clinical monitoring tool awaits many more longitudinal measurements.F-212 | Lung Ultrasound and Computed Tomography in Cystic Fibrosis Children -A Comparative Study Ciuca I. M. 1 , Pop L.

As for Cystic Fibrosis (CF), prompt detection of specific pathogens could enable directed treatment and slow pulmonary deterioration. However, acquisition of sputum from the very young is challenging, as they do not expectorate. Bronchoalveolar lavage is invasive and therefore not used frequently. We routinely collect sputum for bacterial cultures from non-expectorating infants with chronic lung disease and a productive cough in the clinic setting. Airway clearance by an experienced physiotherapist and oropharyngeal suction promotes coughing of pooled secretions to above the larynx for Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for infants aged 0 to 2 years with CF or CPLD, who had at least 2 sputum cultures and were treated at the Schneider Children's Medical Center Pulmonary Institute between 2010-2016. Collected data included microbiological culture results, clinical status, and antibiotic treatment. Results: Ninety-eight infants (16 with CF) were evaluated. A total of 534 cultures were acquired, 201 from CF infants (12 (2-23), median (range) per infant), and 333 from non-CF CPLD infants (3 (2-21), median (range) per infant). Age at first culture was 3.8 (1-19.5) months for CF and 10.4 (0.5-22) months for CPLD. Three hundred ad sixty-one cultures (68%) were positive for any bacteria. Of all positive cultures, 171 (47%) were acquired during pulmonary exacerbations, and 194 (53%) during routine follow-up. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was positive at least once in 46% of patients (56% CF and 44% non-CF CPLD, P = 0.42). More infants with CF compared to CPLD had positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (75% vs. 34%, P = 0.004), Klebsiella oxytoca (31% vs. 7%, P = 0.016) and Pseudomonas species (31% CF and 4% CPLD infants, P = 0.003). One CF and 7 CPLD infants had ESBL-resistant bacteria. No MRSA or multi-resistant Pseudomonas were identified. Chronic P. aeruginosa (Leeds' criteria) was rare: 0/16 CF and 6/82 CPLD, mostly following prolonged hospitalization. In neither group was there a correlation between culture results and pulmonary exacerbations versus routine visits. Conclusions: Airway infection is common in infants with CF and CPLD. Bacterial flora appeared to differ between these patient groups, perhaps confounded by more frequent cultures in CF patients. Staphylococcus aureus was more common in CF infants and may be an early marker for this disease. Interestingly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was common in both CF and CPLD but chronic infection was rare and bacteria were not multi-resistant. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment when required may have decreased chronic carriage and may improve clinical outcome. Our findings are retrospective and a prospective study is warranted. 7 | RESPIRATORY MANIFESTATIONS OF EXTRA-PULMONARY DISEASES (INCLUDING AIDS) G-67 | Respiratory Disorders in Children with 22q Deletion Syndrome: A Retrospective Study Renoux M.

P. 1 , Walther S. 1 , Pommerening H. Allergy, Pulmonology und Cystic Fibrosis, Children's Hospital, Goethe-University -Frankfurt am Main, Germany; 2 Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Children's University Hospital -Frankfurt am Main, Germany Background: Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a progressive, chronic lung disease in which a persistent inflammation leads to obstruction of the small airways. The incidence of BOS rises globally due to steady increases in utilization of SCT. However, the history of lung function in patients with BOS after SCT is poorly characterized although understanding the course of lung function in these patients is necessary for prompt clinical recognition and treatment. The objective of this study is to describe the long-term follow-up of lung function parameters in patients with BOS post SCT. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 10 patients with BOS aged 3.4 to 12.3 years (median 6.4) at the time of the SCT were included. Lung function parameters were investigated over a period of 1.0 to 13.5 years (median 3.54). In total, 213 available lung function tests were evaluated and longitudinal changes in lung function parameters were analyzed. Results: There were three variations of progression noted. Three out of 10 patients developed a significant progressive BOS on computed tomography (CT) such as bronchial wall thickening and mosaic pattern of perfusion, and in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) with neutrophils > 70%, and responded well to steroid pulses. Their lung function parameters improved to normal values during the course of the disease. Conclusion: Our results indicate that BOS leads towards a progressive, chronic lung disease and is related to an increased overall mortality and morbidity. Important elements of treatment involve early and accurate detection, as well as specific and individualized therapeutic concepts to optimize the long-term outcomes in SCT survivors with BOS.

The volume ratios of the right to left ventricles and the systolic functions of the left ventricle were calculated by transthoracic echocardiography. Results: The volume ratios of the ventricles increased from 0.39 + /-0.13 to 0.52 + /-0.26, p-value 0.04. The ejection fraction of the left ventricle increased from 74% + /-6.4% to 76.2% + /-7.1%, p-value 0.39. Conclusions: Cardiac volumes of both ventricles increased significantly and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle maintained within normal ranges after the Nuss operation for pectus excavatum in children. 9 | EPIDEMIOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, PREVENTION, SOCIOECONOMIC COST, PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES I-11 | The Nationwide Survey of Mycoplasma Pneumoniae Infection in Children throughout Japan in Recent 10 Years Ouchi K. Department of Pediatrics, Kawasaki Medical School -Kurashiki, Japan Background: Recently, we experienced a Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection pandemic and an increase in the rate of Macrolideresistant (MR) isolates in Japan. Objective: It is necessary to understand the recent aspects of MP infections among Japanese children. Material and Methods: We enrolled children with suspected MP infections who visited 85 institutions throughout Japan since March 2008 in whom samples were collected. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of the patients. MR isolates were defined by sequencing of domain V of the 23s rRNA gene of MP. Furthermore, we also examined the MICs of 7 antimicrobial agents for the isolates and the distribution trend of MP P1genes. Results: From 2008 to 2017, a total of 1702 MP isolates were obtained. The annual number of isolates reached its peak (598) in 2012 and increased in 2015 and 2016 again. The overall detection rate of MR isolates was 69.3%. The annual rate of the latter reached its peak (81.8%) in 2012. It has since decreased to 8% in 2018. Almost all MR isolates had the A2063G point mutation. There was no isolate resistant to quinolone and tetracycline agents. Furthermore, the detection rate of type 1 of MP P1genes was approximately 50% in the outbreak of 2015-2016, whereas it was more than 90% in the outbreak of 2011-2012. Conclusion: In these 10 years, outbreaks of MP infections have occurred twice in Japan. However, there were differences in the rate of MR isolates and the distribution of MP P1genes among the isolates between the two outbreaks. The annual MR rate of MP infections reached its peak (81.8%) in 2012 and thereafter it has been decreasing to 8% in 2018. Differences exist among racial and ethnic groups in the prevalence and severity of allergic diseases. However, influence of population admixing on allergic disease has not been studied. We examined the effect of population admixing on the occurrence of allergic disease. Methods: We reviewed the data of 68,043 adolescents who participated in the 11th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, which provides a sample that is representative of the entire Korean middle school and high school student population. Multiethnic status was determined by using parental country of birth and prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), and atopic dermatitis (AD) was determined by questionnaire. Results: Multi-ethnic adolescents accounted for approximately 0.9% of the total adolescents. Prevalence of asthma was significantly higher in the multi-ethnic group compared to the non multi-ethnic group while that of AR and AD was significantly higher in the non multi-ethnic group compared to the multi-ethnic group. Parental region of country at birth showed a significant difference in prevalence of allergic disease. Univariate analysis found that urbanity, perceived economic status (PES), parental region of country at birth, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) showed a significant odds ratio (OR) in asthma, AR and AD. Body mass index (BMI) showed a significant OR in asthma and AD. After adjusting for urbanity, PES, BMI and ETS, multiethnicity showed a significantly lower OR in AR and AD. Conclusion: Population admixing appears to have a significant effect on the prevalence of allergic disease. Further study will be needed to clarify the effect of population admixing on prevalence of allergic disease. I-51 | Chronic Wet Cough in Aboriginal Children: When Is a Cough Not Just a Cough?

Key enablers were (i) improving practitioners' knowledge and expertise in managing chronic wet cough, (ii) easy access to clear clinical practice guidelines, (iii) improving health practitioners' cultural competence when working with Aboriginal families, and (iv) health system changes to facilitate longitudinal patient care. Conclusion: Knowledge about chronic wet cough and its implications is not widely appreciated amongst families and health practitioners in remote Western Australia. Culturally appropriate health information for families, training for health practitioners, easy to access clinical practice guidelines and a health service model for effective longitudinal patient care is needed to improve early detection and effective management of chronic wet cough. These measures have the potential to prevent bronchiectasis in Aboriginal children. Reflections: Results may potentially apply to other settings.

The air quality and pollution in the air is completely dependent on the surroundings one lives in. Capturing ourselves indoor during the high level of pollution also needs to be readdressed since indoor air is usually dirtier than the air outdoors, due to trapping of air contaminants inside. Allergic Children are most vulnerable as they are most likely to stay indoors for longer durations. This study aimed to evaluate the change in allergic symptoms in allergic children by using an air purifier. Methods: Forty-five allergic children were recruited from the Hanyang University Guri Hospital Pediatric Allergy Clinic (18 children with atopic dermatitis, 18 with allergic rhinitis, 9 with asthma). A Samsung air purifier was set up in the subject's family room and operated with filter-on for 28 days as acting day and filteroff for 28 days as control with an average 14 hours/d (8-24 hours/d) since September 2018. Allergic symptom scores were self-checked on a smart cellular phone by the subject's parents as Atopic dermatitis: SCORAD; allergic rhinitis: total 4 nasal symptom score (T4NSS); Asthma: Asthma symptom score (ASS). At same period, the level of the PM10, PM2.5, pollens and NO2, SO2, O3 were measured and recorded daily for air quality. Results: The mean improved rate for SCORAD was 15.16%, T4NSS was 28.86%, ASS was 50.7% at the filter-on phase of the air purifier phase than at the filter-off phase. There was no significant correlation between allergic symptom scores and the level of air pollutants and pollens in this period although showed a lag-effect trend between them. Conclusion: Allergic symptom scores were improved by using a mechanical air purifier set up in the home of allergic children.

The purpose of This study is to identify criterion values to evaluate the proficiency of endotracheal suctioning skills between expert nurses and nursing students, using a motion capture system. Twelve expert nurses from two institutions and twelve nursing students from a university were recruited in This study. The maximum anteflexion angle, the path length and fixation time of dorsum manus were measured by a motion capture system (Perception Neuron, Noitom, USA) during endotracheal suctioning on a simulator.

Thirteen experienced nurses from three institutions and twelve nursing students from a university participated in This study. These participants were asked to watch a 2D video of an experienced nurse performing endotracheal suctioning on a training simulator, or 3D CG animation which is able to enlarge areas of interest (AOIs) and rotate virtual camera angles as a visual stimulus. The position of the participants' heads was fixed on a head holder in front of the display. Simultaneously, their eye movement was tracked by a head-mounted eye-mark recorder (EMR-9, NAC Image technology Inc., Japan) with a world camera (62[deg] horizontal angle of view) and binocular cameras.

Veltishchev, Russian Scientific-Research University of Medicine named after N. I. Pirogov -Moscow, Russia The diagnostic search of prolonged and chronic cough in children presents difficulties, because there are many different respiratory and extrapulmonary diseases as its causes. Aim: to determine the clinical structure and causes of prolonged and chronic cough in children. Patients and methods: 272 children aged from 2 to 17 years with prolonged (fromfour to 8 weeks) (n = 109) and chronic cough (more than 8 weeks) (n = 163) were examined. Catamnesis lasted from 6 to 18 months. The control group included 60 healthy children. All patients underwent history and examination, as well as surveys of parents and/or patients with specially designed questionnaire, including the score of the main characteristics of cough (dry/wet, frequency, intensity and others). According to indications, the following were taken: chest X-rays, consultations with specialists, in-depth examination in a ) including its cough variant was diagnosed in 29% and in 8% respectively of children with prolonged and chronic cough. The frequency of occurrence of BA increased with patient age. Other, rarer causes of prolonged and chronic cough (chronic bronchitis; whooping cough; psychogenic, neurogenic cough; gastroesophageal reflux disease; foreign body airway obstruction) were found in 12% of our patients. In clinical structure of the prolonged cough (fromfour to 8 weeks), ARTI prevailed (upper ARTI or exacerbation of the chronic upper respiratory tract infections in 25% and lower ARTI in 40%) in contrast to chronic cough (more than 8 weeks), during which the frequency of allergic genesis of the disease increased (allergic rhinitis in 18% and BA in 34%). Our research proved that a longer cough (regardless of of its genesis) was found in patients with negative predisposing factors and their combination: passive smoking; unfavorable environmental conditions; recurrent respiratory tract infections (P < 0.05). Prolonged and chronic cough was further promoted by previously delayed diagnosis of the disease, insufficient treatment, late consultation with a doctor (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there were more frequently observed recurrent episodes of prolonged or chronic cough in the examined children with the presence of comorbid disease (chronic upper respiratory tract pathology of the infectious/allergic genesis) in contrast to patients without comorbidity (P < 0,05). Thus, the multifactorial causes of prolonged and chronic cough in children necessitate the development and introduction of informative diagnostic algorithms into clinical practice. This will help reduce the time of diagnostic search, enable early start of treatment and preventive measures and improve prognosis and quality of life of patients.

Of the IAP measures, particulate matter (PM10) was associated with reduced TV (-4.60 ml (95% CI-8.51, -0.69) at 2 years and benzene (VOC) with a decrease in FENO (-0.27 (95%CI -0.44-0.11)) over 2 years. Conclusion: Environmental exposures from tobacco smoke and IAP in early life had a significant impact on lung function over 2 years. Reducing early-life environmental exposures, particularly from tobacco smoke, may improve lung function trajectories.

I-225 | Burden of Severe Asthma in Children in the English Primary Care Setting Lenney W. 1 , Hattori T. 1 , Gokhale M. 2 , Van Dyke M. 2 , Evitt L. Outcomes, Global Medical, Glaxosmithkline -London, United Kingdom; 4 Real-World Evidence, Evidera -London, United Kingdom Background: Real world data on the health care burden of severe asthma in children are limited. Aim To describe exacerbations and health care resource use among children with asthma in England. Methods: We included children aged 6 to 17 years in the Clinical Practice Research Database and linked to Hospital Episode Statistics with at least one asthma record between 2011-2015. Four hierarchical groups were defined: treated asthma [with baseline asthma medications], severe asthma [above + Global Initiative for Asthma Step 4/5], severe refractory asthma [SRA; above + \u22652 baseline exacerbations], and eosinophilic SRA [above + blood eosinophils > =150 cells/\u00b5L]. Exacerbations and healthcare resource use during the one-year follow-up period were described. Results: The treated asthma group included 32,893 patients, of which 2,711 (8.2%) had severe asthma and 265 (0.8%) had SRA. The mean age in the treated, severe and SRA groups was 12.1 years, 13.4 years and 12.6 years, respectively. The eosinophilic SRA group included only 8 children, likely driven by the fact that only 3% of the SRA group had . Most children also had > 1 general physician visit within 30 days after the first asthma exacerbation (73.2%, 77.1%, and 81.4% in the treated, severe, and SRA groups, respectively). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the burden of asthma exacerbations and health care resource use in children with asthma increases with increased asthma severity, thus highlighting the potential unmet need for specific treatments in subgroups with more severe disease.

Overnight pulse-oximetry is an alternative diagnostic tool but its feasibility amongst the pediatric age group is debatable. Our study aimed to test the reliability and accuracy of pulse-oximetry performed by WristOx2 for OSA diagnosis and its severity. Method: A cross-sectional study was performed in children aged 1 to 18 years with a clinical suspicion of OSA referred to the pediatric sleep lab at the University of Malaya Medical Center between 2014 and 2018. The WristOx2 (Nonin 3150) was simultaneously applied along with PSG (Cadwell, USA). The pulse oximetry studies were scored using a validated McGill Oximetry Score. Using the PSG as the \"gold standard\", the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for the pulse-oximetry. Results: 163 patients were recruited with a mean age of 9.3 \u00b1 3.5 years and predominantly male (65%). WristOx2 accurately diagnosed OSA in 139 children (86%) when compared to the PSG (95% CI, 0.72, 0.88). The WristOx2 had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI= 0.81, 0.94), specificity 95% (95% CI= 0.86, 0.98), PPV 96% and NPV 84%. WristOx2 had 100% sensitivity (95% CI= 0.93, 1.00) for moderate-tosevere OSA diagnosis and 76% specificity (95% CI= 0.Conclusion: Pulse-oximetry by WristOx is a reliable tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis in children.

E. 2 1 Pediatric Department, Children Hospital, University of Medicine and Pharmacy -Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam; 2 Department of Pediatrics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong -Hong Kong, China Background: Acute dyspnea is one of the most common clinical presentations in the emergency department causing a high number of mortalities globally. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is more widely available in the etiologic diagnosis of acute dyspnea. However, it is still a new method in children with lung diseases. Objectives: To describe lung ultrasound characteristics and to evaluate the agreement between LUS and chest X-ray (CXR) in the diagnosis of four conditions causing almost acute dyspnea in children: pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax and acute pulmonary edema in children in Viet Nam. Methods: We reviewed the records of the children who presented to the emergency department or pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) at Children hospital 1 with acute dyspnea and had a final diagnosis of one of four etiologies: pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax and acute pulmonary edema. All patients underwent CXR and LUS at the time of admission.Results: Eighty-one children were enrolled in the study: 65 cases (80%) of pneumonia, 9 cases (11%) of pleural effusion, 3 cases (4%) of pneumothorax and 4 cases (5%) of acute pulmonary edema. LUS identified 100% cases with pleural effusion and pneumothorax; 92.3% cases with pneumonia and only 75% cases with acute pulmonary edema.When comparing LUS with CRX, we noticed a good agreement between the 2 methods in the diagnosis of pneumonia (kappa = 0.64, P < 0.001).LUS and CRX showed a positive diagnosis for 73.3% of cases with pleural effusion, 50% of cases with pneumothorax and 50% of cases with acute pulmonary edema findings.Conclusion: LUS demonstrated to be a feasible technique which helped clinicians confirm the etiology of acute pulmonary dyspnea. Keywords: acute dyspnea, lung ultrasound, pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, acute pulmonary edema.

Methods: Children who underwent B-BAL or NB-BAL, with no history of chronic cough and no acute respiratory infection in the preceding 4 weeks were included. BAL was obtained according to European Respiratory Society guidelines. For B-BAL, a sterile normal saline solution in three aliquots of 1 ml/kg (maximum 20 ml) was instilled into the right middle lobe (first and third aliquots) and lingula (second aliquot) and the return was suctioned into a mucus trap. The first and second aliquots were pooled for microbiological examination, while the third aliquot was used for cytology. For NB-BAL, with the child's head turned to the left, an 8F catheter was inserted through the endotracheal tube until it was wedged. Sterile normal saline (1 ml/kg, maximum 20 ml) was instilled and collected for microbiology examination. A further 1 ml/kg (maximum 20 ml) was instilled and the second collection was utilized for cytology. Results: The median age of the total cohort (42 B-BAL and 58 NB-BAL) was 7.4 years (range 8 days to 16.6 years). However, the NB-BAL group was significantly older (8.2 years, IQR 5.4-12.5 years, vs. B-BAL 3.3 years, IQR 0.9-9 years).

The upper airway volume was defined as the total volume of nasopharynx and oropharynx as measured with SICAT AIR. Malocclusion was classified according to the anterior dentition into the following groups: crowding group (n = 7), protrusion group (n = 10), deep bite group (n = 11) and crossbite group (n = 11). The upper airway volume was compared among these groups. Statistical significance of differences among the groups was tested by the Mann-Whitney U-test.Results:The upper airway volume (mean \u00b1 SD) was 13921.7 \u00b1 4037.8 mm3, 11847.8 \u00b14288.0 mm3, 10654.5 \u00b13.36.8 and 9617.2 \u00b12898.5 mm3in the three groups, respectively. The upper airway volume was reduced in the order of simple crowing group> protrusion group > deep bite group > crossbite group. Furthermore, the reversed occlusion group's volume was significantly lesser than the crowing group's volume (P < 0.05).Discussion:Our results indicate that upper airway volume in the protrusion and deep bite and crossbite groups is lesser than in the crowding group. This is probably due to severe malocclusion caused by lowering of the tongue position owing to disturbed nasal respiration in the presence of reduced upper airway volume.Conclusion: We suggest that malocclusion in children is associated with upper airway stenosis.

In contrast to microbiome in infancy, there is limited data on upper airway microbiota composition of healthy toddlers. This study investigated the profiles and determinants for nasal microbiota in Chinese toddlers. Methods: Flocked nasal swab samples were collected at baseline from subjects who participated in a nutritional intervention study (registration identifier: NTR4779), which were stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. DNA isolated by mechanical lysis was subjected to Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Samples with less than 6000 bp reads in amplicon sequencing were excluded from further analysis. Possible associations between host factors and nasal microbiota composition were analyzed using non-supervised and supervised statistical methods. Results: A random subset of 160 participants aged 18.2 \u00b1 4.9 months, with 72 (45%) being males, were identified for this microbiome analysis. One hundred and forty-three (89.4%) children were ever breastfed for 4.0 \u00b1 4.7 months. Forty-five (28.1%) children had passive smoking exposure. Based on DNA quantity and PCR quality, 94.4% of samples were eligible for microbial analysis. Following feature selection by abundance and coefficients of variation, we identified seven dominant bacterial genera that included Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, Moraxella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus and Helcococcus. These genera were also observed in deep nasopharyngeal swabs of Dutch children (Biesbroek et al, 2014; Bosch et al, 2016). We observed considerable heterogeneity of these microbes in nasal samples. Subjects' age accounted for 0.72% of the variance seen in microbiota composition (P = 0.005). However, none of the following factors significantly explained the variation in microbiota composition: gender, breastfeeding ever, presence of siblings, daycare attendance, history of neonatal problems, occurrence of allergic diseases and passive smoking exposure.

Pediatric Pulmonology and Allergy, Osaka Women's and children's Hospital -diagnosed in early infancy; on the other hand, cases that are not severe are often misdiagnosed. Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of TBM. However, this procedure is invasive and requires sedation and special techniques, thereby limiting its use. Alternatively, dynamic four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) imaging is potentially a noninvasive modality. This study compares the findings of 4D CT with those of FB in the assessment of TBM. Aim: To assess the accuracy of 4D CT in detecting TBM in young children. Methods: Fifteen patients underwent 4D CT and FB at the Department of Pediatric Pulmonology and Allergy of Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital from April 2015 to December 2018.TBM was retrospectively reviewed as present or absent in 3 anatomic segments: trachea and the right and left main stem bronchi. TBM was defined as > 50% reduction of the airway lumen. Results: The study population comprised 15 patients (8 males and 7 females) with ages ranging from 1 month to 5 years(median: 9 months). The most common presenting symptom was recurrent wheezing. Eleven patients were diagnosed with airway malacia from the FB findings. Among the others, 1 patient had gastroesophageal reflux disease, 2 patients had complete tracheal rings, and 1 was idiopathic. The overall diagnostic accuracy of 4D CT compared to FB was 91% (41/45 possible segments). The agreement was not different between that for the trachea and the left and right bronchi. 4D CT indicated no false-positive results. Conclusions: 4D CT is a highly accurate and reliable noninvasive imaging modality for evaluating TBM in young children. J-207 | Sonographic Characteristics of Consolidation in Children Tang C. W.

Our objective was to determine the clinical application of chest sonography in pediatric patients with particular emphasis on sonographic characteristics in consolidation in lobar pneumonia in children. Method: The study was conducted comparing chest sonography in 35 children from birth to 18 years of age suspected of having lobar pneumonia in a tertiary-teaching hospital. All ultrasound examinations were conducted using a 3 to 8 MHZ probe. Chest sonography was performed by 2 authors (KSH and CWT). Chest sonography was interpreted independent of the radiographic findings. the right lower, 4 on the left upper and 11 on the left lower lobe. Sonographic signs that indicated lobar pneumonia were consolidation in the individual lung lobes. Cases with lobar pneumonia and consolidation showed scattered airbronchogram, There was no air entry with mixed fluid and tissue density, loss of nature curvature of lung surface with shrinkage of lung tissues. Conclusion: Chest ultrasonography is a useful, safe and accurate diagnostic tool for evaluating children with lobar pneumonia and could well delineate consolidated lung in the affected lobes. 11 | THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES K-50 | Outcomes of Home Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) in Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in a Pediatric Unit in Hong Kong Leung T.

Pediatric Surgery, China Medical University Children's Hospital -Taichung City, Taiwan; 3 Department of Pediatric Surgery, HsinChu Mackay Memorial Hospital -HsinChu City, Taiwan Background: Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is a significant clinical problem in pediatric populations. Patients with recurrent PSP or persistent air leakage require video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for bullectomy and mechanical pleurodesis. Compared to conventional triple-port VATS (TP-VATS), single port-VATS (SP-VATS) has become a trend in adult populations owing to a smaller surgical wound, less pain and a more rapid recovery period. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of single port VATS for pediatric patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients (age less than 18 years old) who received VATS for bullectomy and pleurodesis for recurrent PSP between January-May 2015 to September 2018 at the China Medical University Children's Hospital. The surgical outcome of conventional TP-VATS and SP-VATS were compared and analyzed.Results: A total of 63 surgeries were performed in our institute, including 12 cases of TP-VATS and 51 of SP-VATS.The  patients' median age was 16\u00b11.15 years old, and 92.3% patients were male (Male to Female ratio= 12:1). The site of the pneumothorax was 62.9% at the left side, 32.3% at the right side, and 4.8% at both sides. The operation time (109.3\u00b123.9 for TP-VATS vs. 100.2 \u00b1 39.2 minutes for SP-VTAS, P = 0.258) and postoperative hospital stay (3.1\u00b10.87 vs. 3.57\u00b11.01 days, P = 0.251) were not significantly different between these two groups. The ipsilateral recurrence rate was slightly higher in the TP-VATS group compared to the SP-VATS group (33% vs. 13.7%, OR= 2.36, P = 0.095) The median recurrence time after surgery was slightly longer in TP-VATS than in SP-VATS (188 [156.3 -294.8] vs. 141.5 [74.5-245.5] days, P = 0.096). Females were more likely than males to have ipsilateral recurrence in the SP-VATS group (M:F= 10.4% vs. 40%, OR= 5.73, P = 0.124). Conclusion: SP-VATS is as effective as TP-VATS for treating pediatric patients with recurrent PSP. Both groups have similar operation time and postoperative hospital stay; nevertheless, SP-VATS is associated with lower recurrence rate and longer recurrence time. Women Medical College -Dhaka, Bangladesh; 3 Pediatrics, Ibrahim Medical College -Dhaka, Bangladesh Introduction: Foreign body (FB) aspiration in the airway is a common occurrence in the pediatric age group; however, it is not always diagnosed (especially in radiolucent FB) due to nonspecific symptoms of varying severity. Often the symptoms are subtle and mistaken for other more common conditions such as pneumonia and asthma and does not respond as expected to standard therapy and presents a diagnostic challenge. Aim: This study aimed to emphasize the importance of considering endobronchial foreign body as a cause of persistent or recurrent respiratory symptoms in children and to outline the clinical evidence of the utility and feasibility of flexible bronchoscopy for endobronchial FB management in children. Methods: This prospective study was performed on children (aged 6 months to 6 years) having recurrent or long standing, non-resolving or partially resolving respiratory complaints who underwent flexible bronchoscopyfor suspected FB from July to December 2018 in a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh. History, clinical, radiological, bronchoscopic findings and immediate effect after bronchoscopy were analyzed.Results: Among a total of 11 children, only 18.2% (n = 2) had a definite history of FB aspiration. The most frequent symptom was paroxysmal cough (72.7%) followed by wheezing, stridor and recurrent pneumonia. FB was found in 54.5% (n = 6) of children and removed successfully by Dormia basket in 5 children and 1 by grasping forceps. The most common (n = 3) FB was peanut. Other foreign bodies were a plastic Tasbih bead, a pencil torch light filament and a custard apple seed. Respiratory symptoms improved after removal of foreign bodies in all cases. During the procedure, transient hypoxia developed in 2 children which was alleviated by temporary cessation of the procedure. Conclusions: The possibility of foreign body aspiration should be considered in any child who presents with persistent or recurrent respiratory symptoms. Flexible bronchoscopy is documented as a crucial diagnostic and safe therapeutic tool for foreign body management in the pediatric age group. 12 | CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY L-81 | Role of Biomarker and Effect of FIP-FVE in an Acute and Chronic Animal Asthma Model Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease.

Previous studies have also shown that excessive inflammation worsens chronic and allergic inflammatory diseases. Moreover, different stages of asthma and allergic inflammatory diseases might also appear in different immune environments. Objective: In this study, we investigated an immune microenvironment including cytokines and chemokines during acute and chronic stages of an asthma/allergy model and also investigated the effect of FIP-fve in the immune microenvironment during acute and chronic stages. Materials and Methods: Acute, female BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally sensitized with ovalbumin on days 1, 2 and 3, and received intranasal OVA challenges on days 14, 17, 21, 24 and 27. The sensitized mice were divided into different groups according to the course of designed airway changes. FIP-fve groups of sensitized mice received 200\u03bcg of FIP-fve on days 1 to 14 (pretreatment) and the other groups of sensitized mice received the same drug on days 14 to 27 (posttreatment). In the chronic model, the mice were intraperitoneally sensitized with ovalbumin on days 1, 2 and 3, and received intranasal OVA challenges on days 14, 17, 21, 24, 27, 60, 69, 71, 73, 74 and 75. However, FIPfve groups of OVA-treated mice were given FIP-fve. The pretreated groups were given FIP-fve on days 1 to 14 and days 45 to 60. The post-treated groups were given FIP-fve or a corticosteroid on days 14 to 28 and days 60 to 75. Results: According to the results, TGF-\u03b2, TNF-a, IL-8, IL-17, CXCL-1, CXCL-10, CCL-17 and CCL-22 were highest in the chronic stage compared to the acute stage. However, their difference might be the marker to distinguish between acute or chronic stage in asthma. Moreover, in the FIP-fve groups, Th2 cytokines and TNF-a, IL-8, IL-17, TGF-\u03b2, CXCL-1, CXCL-10, CCL-17 and CCL-22 were decreased significantly while IL-22 increased significantly in the FIP-fve groups during the chronic stage. Conclusions: There are many different immune responses in the different stages of asthma. Therefore, our finding could be the marker to distinguish between acute or chronic stage in asthma. However, FIP-fve can improve asthma through immune regulation not only in acute, but also in chronic stages. Hence, FIP-fve might be an alternative therapy that can be used in the different stages in allergic airway diseases such as asthma. Pediatric Pulmonology, Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health and MRC Unit on Child and Adolescent Health, University of Cape Town and Ministry of Health Malaysia -Cape Town, South Africa; 2 Division of Pathology, National Health Laboratory Services and University of Cape Town -Cape Town, South Africa Background: Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease (CHILD) is a rare but important cause of DLD. Controlled ventilation high resolution computed tomography (CVHRCT) and bronchoalveolar lavage play limited roles in the diagnosis of CHILD. Genetic testing for the hereditary form of CHILD is expensive and not widely available in low middle-income countries (LMIC), including South Africa. Thus, lung biopsy is a potentially useful diagnostic tool in diagnosing and directing therapeutic management of CHILD. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Cape Town, South Africa, on the role of lung biopsy in diagnosing CHILD and directing therapeutic management in children presenting with DLD.Results: Thirty-six (36) lung biopsies for DLD were performed between January 1 2013 and June 30 2018. Median age was 52 months (range 1 To 164 months), 15 (42%) females, 19 (53%) < 2 years age; 8 (22%) were performed via open lung biopsy and 25 (69%) via Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS). A definitive histological diagnosis was reached in 35/36 (97%) patients. In children < 2 years of age, pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (7/19, 37%), probable surfactant dysfunction/ chronic pneumonitis of infancy (4/19, 21%), others (7/19, 37%) including lung infections, systemic disease, lipoid pneumonia and congenital pulmonary airway malformation, were the leading causes. One had no histological diagnosis due to suboptimal specimen. In children > 2 years age, pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (9/17, 53%) followed by pulmonary infections, pulmonary lymphangiectasia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and metastatic thyroid carcinoma were the leading causes (8/17, 47%). Complications of lung biopsy were few (4/36,11%) and included pneumothorax, bleeding, emphysema and infection. Intervention involved the increase or addition of immunosuppressive drugs 20/ 35 (57%), discontinuation of therapy 6/35 (17%), palliation 2/35 (6%) and addition of other treatment 7/35 (20%) such as antibiotics, immunoglobulins, ganciclovir and sirolimus. Thirty (30/36, 83%) children are currently being followed, 5 died (14%) including two post mortem biopsies, and 1 (3%) was lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Lung biopsy has an important role in diagnosing CHILD and directing therapeutic management in children presenting with DLD in LMIC where genetic testing for hereditary CHILD conditions is not widely available. Pulmonary hemorrhage syndromes with capillaritis is an important cause of CHILD in South Africa. Community-acquired pneumonia can be complicated by empyema thoracis. Prompt diagnosis and management will influence the outcome. We intend to compare the management of empyema thoracis in Malaysia to local and international guidelines. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study of children diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia complicated by empyema thoracis, who were admitted to Penang Hospital (northern regional tertiary hospital with Pediatric Respiratory services), Malaysia from October 2017 to October 2018. Adherence to the standards for diagnosis, investigation and management were analyzed. Results: Fifteen patients were reviewed, of which 86% (13/15) were less than 5 years old. Approximately 53% (8/15) presented before Day 5 of illness and only 40% (6/15) received outpatient antibiotics. Most patients were diagnosed with empyema thoracis based on the chest radiograph during the first week of illness (67%, 10/15 cases, median: Day 5 of illness). All patients were subjected to thoracic ultrasound for confirmation and staging of effusion by the second week of illness (Median: Day 8.5 of illness). Chest drainage was performed in 67% (10/15) of patients, however, first insertion was at median Day 10 of illness due to late presentation. Urokinase was administered in 47% (7/15) of patients with a failure rate of 57% (4/7). They were unsuitable for urokinase intervention due to late presentation and referral or clinically unstable upon diagnosis. Mostpatients underwent open lateral thoracotomy and decortication (73%, 11/15 cases) with prolonged median hospital stay of 21 days (range 14 -52 days) while those who had successful urokinase therapy had a median hospital stay of 16 days (range 14 -23 days). This may be due to late presentation, unsuccessful urokinase therapy and inaccessibility of Video Assisted Thoracoscopy Surgery (VATS) in Penang Hospital. One patient recovered with only antibiotic therapy (without any urokinase or surgical intervention). Conclusion: Empyema thoracis is associated with high morbidity but rarely mortality. There were various limitations in our center which eventually led to surgical management of empyema thoracis. In the presence of a Malaysian consensus guideline, educational courses need to be reinforced to ensure better understanding, proper implementation and improve outcomes. M-48 | Correlation of Fingertip PPO versus Arterial O2 Saturation Result of Patients with Pneumonia Ages 2 Mos to 18 Y/O Seen at the ER of QCGH Marquinez M. Department of Pediatrics, Quezon City General Hospital & Medical Center -All pediatric patients aged 2 mos. -18 years seen at the QCGH -Emergency department presented with PCAP C & D. Methods: O2 saturations of patients with PCAP C & D using only one MD FS20A brand of Fingertip PPO and ABGs were obtained and recorded. O2 saturations by Fingertip PPO and arterial oxygen saturation were then compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Statistical Analysis: SPSS version 10 for Windows was used. Descriptive statistics were generated for all variables. For nominal data, frequencies and percentages were computed. For numerical data, mean \u00b1 SD were generated. Analysis of the different variables was performed using Pearson's correlation and McNemar test. Results: A total of 168 subjects were included. Mean age was 2.94 years. Mean RR was 58.41. There was a strong positive correlation of 0.72 noted in the comparison of the results of O2 saturation pulse oximeter and arterial blood gas result as proven by the p value of < 0.001. The oxygen saturation reading of Fingertip PPO was comparable with arterial oxygen saturation. As oxygen saturation in fingertip PPO increased, arterial oxygen saturation result also increased or vice versa. Conclusion: This study showed a direct correlation between the O2 saturation obtained from Fingertip Portable Pulse Oximeter with that of the oxygen saturation in arterial blood gas. Keywords: O2 saturation, portable pulse oximeter (PPO), SaO2. M-125 | Prevalence of Zinc Deficiency and Effect of Zinc Supplementation on Prevention of Respiratory Infections in Preschool Children: An Observational Study Khera D. 1 , Singh S. 2 , Purohit P. 3 , Sharma P. 3 , Singh K. 1 1 Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences -Jodhpur, India; 2 Pharmacology, All India institute of Medical Sciences -Jodhpur, India; 3 Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences -Jodhpur, India Background: Routine zinc supplementation is a potential intervention for the prevention of acute lower respiratory infections in developing countries. However discrepant findings from recent randomized trials remain unexplained. Methods: This study was a prospective, open label single arm clinical study. Four hundred and sixty-five healthy children aged 6 months to 5 years were enrolled in the study. The data on socio-demographic profile, number and duration of episodes of acute upper and lower respiratory infections in the last 6 months were collected through a pretested structured questionnaire. There was no significant difference with regard to mean age, weight, height and modified Kuppuswamy classification of family status between zinc deficient and non-zinc deficient groups. There was a significant difference in mid arm circumference between zinc deficient and non-zinc deficient groups. Also the number of episodes of acute upper respiratory infections (AURI) and mean duration of acute respiratory infection (ARI) was significantly different in the two groups. There was no significant difference in acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) episodes in the two groups. After zinc supplementation in zinc deficient children, there was a significant decrease in the number of episodes of AURI, ALRI and mean duration of ARI at 6 months after supplementation as compared to the preceding 6 months before supplementation. Conclusion: This study sheds light on the efficacy of short course prophylactic zinc supplementation in reducing the burden of ARI among zinc deficient children. Future studies should assess the effectiveness of delivering prophylactic zinc supplementation at scale, comparing the feasibility and cost benefit of short course and continuous regimens. M-151 | Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Pediatric Septic Shock Phung N. T. N. 1 , Hon K. L. E. 2 1 PICU, Children's Hospital 1 -Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam; 2 Department of Pediatrics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong -Hong Kong, China Background: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a serious complication of sepsis and septic shock. This syndrome increases the mortality rate of sepsis. The exact diagnosis and treatment of ARDS contribute to a reduction in mortality from hypoxia and from sepsis in general. Objectives: To describe the ARDS characteristics in children with septic shock at a teaching hospital in Viet Nam. Methods: A descriptive prospective study of ARDS in children from 2 months to 15 years old with septic shock between 10/2008 and 4/ 2011 in the emergency department and intensive care unit at Children's Hospital 1 in Ho Chi Minh city, Viet Nam. Septic shock was diagnosed according to criteria of the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference in 2005. We used the Berlin definition to recruit ARDS cases with at least 2 samples of blood gases separated by 12 to 24 hours showing a ratio of PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 300 mm Hg. We excluded patients with congenital heart disease and heart failure.",

It is an important procedure for evaluating the pediatric airway as well as therapeutic purposes. In Indonesia, the procedure is still less performed due to less availability of the equipment and the experts as well. It is a great challenge for us as pediatric pulmonologists in Indonesia to start initiating the procedure more widely to our patients.Objective: To describe our 6 years' experience of performing pediatric flexible bronchoscopy in Harapan Kita Women and Children Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia.Method: All children with varying indications who had undergone a FB procedure from August 2012 to August 2017. Children of age 1-month to 18-years were included in this study. The data were collected from medical records and analyzed using SPSS version 22.Results: Of 591 patients, boys were more predominant (n = 354, 59.9%) than girls (n = 237, 40.1%). There were 69.9% (n = 413) children under 12 months old, 17.8% (n = 105) were between 12 to 36 months old, 12.3% (n = 73) more than 36 months old, and the youngest was 10 days of age. There were 32.5% (n = 192) of the patients who were referred from other hospitals. The procedures were performed in the operating theatre and PICU. Sedation was performed by our anesthesiologist or pediatric intensivist colleagues.None of the patients suffered from severe complication after the procedure. The FB findings were laryngomalacia as a single condition (52.8%), normal airway (8.8%), left main bronchus stenosis (8.6%), laryngo-tracheomalacia (6.9%), foreign body aspiration (2.7%)Flexible bronchoscopy is a very helpful tool in the management of pediatric airway problems. There is an increasing need for the procedure. We must start and improve the procedure in Indonesia to enhance the comprehensive management of childhood airway problems.Keywords: airway problems, pediatric flexible bronchoscopy, diagnostic, therapeutic tools, complication.M-170 | Sociodemographic Features and Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Nigerian ChildrenOloyede I. P. , David U.Pediatrics, University of Uyo Teaching Hospital -Uyo, Nigeria Background: The World Health Organization recommends that bacteriological confirmation of TB should be sought whenever possible as indicated by clinical presentation. This is however not usually possible due to the paucibacilliary nature of childhood TB and the difficulty in getting sputum from young children. In Nigeria at present, the diagnosis of TB in children is made using the TB score chart which is based on clinical findings. Objective: To assess the sociodemographic features and the diagnostic methods of childhood tuberculosis in Nigerian children. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. Data were extracted from the case notes of children managed fo r tuberculosis in the Pediatric ward and the DOTs clinic of UUTH from January 2013 to December 2017. Information extracted from the case records included the patients' epidemiological data , duration of illness, signs and symptoms, TB score, chest radiograph findings and microbiological diagnosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis was defined as a symptomatic child with: (1) bacteriologically-confirmed tuberculosis, (2) radiologically-confirmed tuberculosis, or (3) probable tuberculosis (as defined). Probable TB was defined as a TB score > 7 and a good clinical response to antituberculosis treatment in the absence of bacteriologica l confirmation or radiological certainty. Radiologically-certain TB was defined as agreement between two independent radiologists that the chest X-ray indicated certain tuberculosis and a TB score 1 to 6 in the absence of bacteriological confirmation and a good clinical response to antituberculosis treatment. Results: Thirty-three patients met the criteria for TB as defined in this study. The total inpatients from January 2013 to December 2017 were 3276, while the total number of respiratory ) was the commonest symptom recorded with a mean duration of 13 weeks, followed by weight loss (63%) and fever (63%). Pallo r (47%) was the commonest clinical sign, followed by lymphadenopathy (44%). Nine patients (28%) had abnormal chest signs. Tw o patients (7%) had a positive sputum AAFB result, geneXpert wa s positive in the gastric aspirate sample of one patient and negativ e for all the sputum and lymph node aspirate results. The ches t radiograph was suggestive of TB in 21 (84%) patients while TB-HIV coinfection was present in nine (29%) patients. Tuberculin skin tes t (Mantoux) measurement ranged from 0-23mm with a mean \u00b1 SD o f 10\u00b17.8. Nine (53%) of the patients had a Mantoux result of 10mm and above. The TB score ranged from 6 to 17 with 96% of th e patients having a TB score of seven and above. Conclusions: The microbiological confirmation of TB in Nigeria n children is grossly inadequate and the TB score chart and TB algorithm is still the preferred method of TB diagnosis in Nigerian children.

O-21 | Esophageal Duplication Cyst Presenting with Stridor in a Child with Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation: A Rare Case Report Lin C. H. 1 , Chen C. H. 1 , Sun C. F. 2 1 Division of Pediatric Pulmonology, China Medical University Children's Hospital -Taichung, Taiwan; 2 College of Medicine, China Medical University -Taichung, Taiwan Background: Esophageal duplication cyst (EDC) is a rare developmental aberration arising from the embryonic foregut. It may remain asymptomatic but produces a mass effect on surrounding organs if it rapidly enlarges. Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM)is a congenital lung malformation with an unknown chance of developing symptoms. Here we report a rare case of a esophageal duplication cyst with CPAM.Case summary: A 16-month old boy with type 2 CPAM presented progressive stridor and was admitted to our hospital because of pneumonia. The patient responded poorly to antibiotics. A chest X-ray showed consolidation in the left upper lobe with tracheal right side deviation. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a cystic lesion 3.3 cm in size in the superior mediastinum. During the surgery, we found an isolated cystic lesion located between the trachea and bilateral carotid arteries. The cyst was completely removed and some yellowish turbid was exuded when the cyst was incised. Microscopically, the cyst was lined by squamous epithelium (90%) and ciliated columnar epithelium (10%). The cyst wall presented predominantly of smooth muscle, with an absence of mucus gland, cartilage, thyroid follicle, lymphoid tissue, or thymic tissue. Finally, pathological diagnosis was confirmed as an EDC.The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged as such. One month later, at outpatient clinic follow-up visit, the patient no longer had stridor.Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of EDC with left side type 2 CPAM. Our patient is also the only known case to recover well without lobectomy of CPAM. Despite the rarity of esophageal duplication cyst, a chest CT scan should be considered for children with persistent stridor, as well as CXR findings of the trachea deviated by a mass lesion in the mediastinum, especially for those with CPAM. We report the case of a 2-year-old female with suppurative chronic bronchitis associated with esophageal candidiasis revealing a rare genetic disease, recently described: heterozygous STAT1 gain of function.Case Report: E. 2 years old, with no personal or family past history and no inbreeding, was referred for feeding difficulties(anorexia and crying for first 6 months), with failure to thrive associated with persistent wet cough since the age of 6 months and persistent mouth candidiasis (despite prolonged adequate treatment). Clinical examination found crackles in the left inferior lobe with folds candidiasis. Chest radiograph (fig 1) showed left inferior opacity consistent with partial atelectasis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed thick and diffuse secretions, predominantly in left bronchial tree. Bronchoalveolar lavage was inflammatory (79% of neutrophils) with 10(8) Haemophilus influenzae. Gastroesophageal endoscopy revealed esophagitis with erythema with white deposits, consistent with candidiasis (confirmed by biopsies). The main etiologies of chronic suppurative bronchitis were ruled out: sweat test, immunological test (NFS, Ig G,A,M; IgG1-4), barium swallow, pH-meter were normal. CT scan (fig 2) showed partial atelectasis of the lingula, medial segment of the middle lobe, anterobasal segment of the right inferior lobe and bronchiectasis of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. Because of the association of bronchiectasis and persistent candidiasis, complementary immunological tests were performed: lymphocytic phenotyping showing mild T and NK lymphopenia, with B lymphocytosis; the search for mutation on the STAT1 gene was positive (heterozygous gain of function C.1154C-T in exon 4 STAT1 gene). Discussion: Heterozygous STAT1 gain of function mutations was first described in 2011. Since then, over 50 mutations were described. It is responsible for more than 50 % of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMCD). The largest case series identified 274 patients(1): symptoms started around 12 months and were heterogeneous: bacterial (cutaneous and airways, with mainly Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas) viral, mycobacterial infections. They touched upper and lower airways, responsible for bronchiectasis in 20% of cases. Autoimmunity can be present in 40% of cases. Morbidity is severe, and mortality is premature (cancer, cerebral aneurysm). In cases of chronic suppurative bronchitis and/or bronchiectasis, heterozygous STAT1 gain of function mutations should be searched (after excluding current etiologies), especially if associated with candidiasis. (1) Toubiana et al Heterozygous STAT1 gain of function mutations underlie an unexpectedly broad clinical phenotype.

Tuberculosis (TB) is endemic in many Sub-Saharan African countries. The burden is further made worse by the HIV scourge. The number of children with TB and its attendant complications, is equally on the rise. TB can mimic many diseases ranging from infections to malignancies. Among pleuro-pulmonary TB complications, exudative effusion is more common while chylothorax is rare and thus easily missed especially if no classical milky appearance.",

Right lung hypoplasia was suspected by our unit. Computed tomography of the thorax and pulmonary angiogram demonstrated right lung hypoplasia, hypoplastic right pulmonary artery, partial anomalous left pulmonary artery and possible esophageal bronchus. Bronchoscopy showed absent right bronchus with no fistula while esophagoscopy showed a fistula from the esophagus which was suspicious of right main bronchus. The diagnosis of esophageal lung was secured. Right pneumonectomy was performed due to a short and hypoplastic right bronchus. He was discharged with no respiratory support and was well during subsequent follow-up. Esophageal lung is a rare cause of congenital pulmonary bronchopulmonary foregut malformation and scarcely reported in the literature. Although rare, children with recurrent pneumonia and persistent opacities on chest radiographs who are unresponsive to conventional medical treatment should be evaluated for congenital bronchopulmonary malformation. Anastomosis of esophageal lung to Early Diagnosis of Infantile Laryngeal Cyst by Flexible Bronchoscopy Tsai T. A., Tsai C. K., Lee Y. C., Liu T. Y., Tsai C. M., Niu C. K., Yu H. R. Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital -Kaohsiung Medical Center -Kaohsiung, TaiwanCongenital stridor is not a rare condition in infants. Although laryngomalacia accounts for 70%-80% of congenital stridor in infants, the possibility of other etiologies should be kept in mind.We herein report a case of laryngeal cyst in a 3-month-old boy who suffered from stridor breathing sounds since one-month-old accompanied with poor feeding and failure to thrive. Bronchoscopy and head and neck CT revealed one 1.1x1.3 cm laryngeal cyst at midline and another 6 mm cyst inferior to the epiglottis.The patient underwent CO2 laser marsupialization and the pathology showed mucocutaneous tissue with cyst lined by stratified squamous epithelium. The breathing pattern was smooth after the operation and his growth curve caught up later. Early flexible bronchoscopy diagnosis can rescue the failure to thrive of this condition. Epidermoid cyst, thyroglossal cyst, and vallecular cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital laryngeal cyst. O-74 | Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Caused by Lingual Tonsil Hypertrophy after Adenotosillectomy in a 2-Year-Old Girl with Nemaline Myopathy Higuchi O. 1 , Kubota H. 1 , Nanbu R. 2 , Hirai N. Takaoka Hospital -Takaoka, Japan Background: Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy is common. Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is the first line treatment to improve OSA in most children. However, there is a possibility that compensatory enlargement of other tonsils occurs after AT, and it can cause OSA again. There are few reports evaluating risk factors for OSA relapse after AT. We present the case of a 2-year-old girl with congenital myopathy who had relapse of severe OSA caused by compensatory sublingual tonsil hypertrophy a year later after the first AT. Case Report: A 22-month-old girl with nemaline myopathy who had been cared with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) at home underwent AT because of OSA caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy. After the AT, her symptoms of OSA improved. However, when she was 34 months old, into cardiopulmonary arrest caused by mucous suffocation in spite of the management with NIV in an intensive care unit. She was recovered with immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation with tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. After this episode, a tracheotomy was performed and symptoms of OSA improved. She was discharged without neurological sequelae and has been cared with all-day mechanical ventilation at home. Congenital muscle diseases in young children can be a risk factor of relapse of OSA by compensatory enlargement of other tonsils after AT. High-risk patients should be evaluated repeatedly with a laryngeal endoscopy after AT to detect compensatory enlargement of other tonsils. O-75 | Lipoblastoma: A Rare Cause of Acute Mediastinal Syndrome Wang Y. H., Chen I. C., Dai Z. K., Hsu J. H., Liu Y. C. Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University -Kaohsiung, Taiwan Mediastinal syndrome has become increasingly recognized as the use of diagnostic imaging increases. A lipoblastoma is a rare, benign, rapidly growing tumor that develops principally (and asymptomatically) on the extremities during infancy. We report a 6-month-old male infant with a presentation of acute bronchiolitis with respiratory distress. Sudden onset of cyanosis with respiratory failure and emergent intubation occurred 3 days after admission. X-ray showed a mediastinal mass unexpectedly. Subsequent chest CT revealed a tumor located in the upper posterior mediastinum, which anteriorly displaced the esophagus and the trachea, and entrapped the descending aorta. Exploratory thoracotomy was performed by pediatric thoracic and cardiovascular surgeons for complete excision. The pathological report revealed lipoblastoma. The patient's respiratory condition improved and extubation was performed 4 days after operation. He had no need for further chemotherapy and no recurrence of tumor in the 4 years follow-up. and esophagus. In addition, stenosis of the distal trachea and right main bronchus was found due to external compressions by the pulmonary artery, vertebral body and azygos vein. Due to recurrent wheezing and failure to thrive, surgery was performed at the age of 2 years old. Left pulmonary artery reconstruction with sliding tracheoplasty was performed. After operation, the clinical course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 2 weeks after surgery. O-88 | Intra-tracheal Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in an ARDS Patient with Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia Supported by ECMO Chen Y. H., Tan g Y. H., Chen W. Y., Yen H. J., Tsao P. C., Yu T. Y., Lee Y. S., Jeng M. J., Soong W. J. Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Veterans General Hospital -Taipei, Taiwan Acute respiratory complications occur frequently during the early phase of leukemia, and the most severe form is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Leukemia-related complications and documented infections are the most frequent etiologies of ARDS. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) allows for ultraprotective ventilation to minimize ventilator-associated lung injury and enable injured lung parenchyma to heal. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising therapeutic effects in preclinical models of both ARDS and sepsis. Poor outcome is usually accompanied in immunocompromised patients with hematological malignancies, and usually worsens with ECMO-related major bleeding, cannula infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). We herein report a 6-year-old girl with immunocompromised status and ARDS. She was rescued by ECMO, exogenous surfactant supplementation, and intratracheal mesenchymal stem cell therapy. Her underlying disease was juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). ARDS developed soon after JMML being diagnosed. She was initially rescued by ECMO, but lung conditions did not gain much improvement for months despite aggressive ventilatory care and exogenous surfactant use. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy was then considered after full discussion with the family and obtaining approval from the institutional review board for human trial. We administered intratracheal mesenchymal stem cell therapy via fiberbronchoscopy once per week for the potentially beneficial effects of intracheal mesenchymal stem cell therapy to treat immunocompromised ARDS cases who are already under ECMO support. O-94 | A Life-Threatening Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation in a Very Low Birth Weight Premature with Giant Patent Ductus Arteriosus Wu J. R 1 , Yang Y. N. 1 , Ko P. J. 2 , Tsai Y. C. 1 , Su Y. T. 1 1 Department of Pediatrics, E-Da Hospital, I-Shou University -Kaohsiung, Taiwan; 2 Department of Pediatric Surgery, E-Da Hospital. I-Shou University -Kaohsiung, Taiwan This very low birth weight premature male baby was born by cesarean section due to twin delivery, premature rupture of membranes, at the gestational age of 26 weeks and 1 day. The patient weighed 1,100 gm, the Apgar score at one and 5 minutes was 6 and 8, respectively. He had respiratory distress since birth, and the initial diagnosis was premature with grade III respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and neonatal sepsis. RDS persisted after surfactant use, and high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was applied since birth for desaturation, subcostal retraction, and grunting. Significant patent ductus arteriosus, 1.9 mm with left to right shunt when the patient was 3 days old, surgical ligation was carried out after 2 days of ibuprofen treatment without proper response. Multiple cystic lesions were well visualized in the left lower lung before and after PDA ligation. Respiratory distress was persistent. The chest radiograph showed progressively prominent multiple cyst lesions in the left lower lung. Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) was highly suspected. Because of sudden onset of frequent desaturation and hypotension when the patient was 10 days old, emergent open chest surgery was performed. CPAM was excised by the pediatric surgical team Partial lung lobectomy was carried out. The surgical specimen consisted of multiple lung cysts and confirmed the diagnosis of type 2 CPAM. The postoperation course was uneventful, he was discharged with good condition. Conclusion and reflection: CPAM, previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is a congenital disorder of the lung. It occurs in approximately 1 in every 30,000 newborns. Unlike type 1, type 2 congenital pulmonary airway malformation is more difficult to detect prenatally and should be taken into consideration when facing an infant with persistent respiratory distress.

In addition to traditional intensive care, the technique of 3D-printing to assist surgical reconstruction, maintaining ECMO on a 2-kg neonate, and flexible bronchoscopy for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions all played important roles in trying to save this infant's life. In conclusion, TA should be considered during difficult tracheal intubation of a newborn baby with respiratory distress. Flexible bronchoscopy, CT scan and surgical interventions for diagnosis and management are suggested. Further updated techniques for effective therapy are required to improve the outcomes.

A thoracoscopic lung biopsy showed diffuse proliferation and dilation of lymphatic channels within the pleura and interlobular septa typical of lymphangiomatosis, associated with spindle cell proliferation with admixed red blood cells, typical of the kaposiform variant. Following the lung biopsy, an ipsilateral pleural effusion developed and progressed over subsequent months despite Propranolol and Sirolimus treatment, to occupy the entire left hemithorax (Figure 1A). MR lymphangiography showed huge left lymphatic collaterals draining into the left lung and pleural space. Lymphatic embolization resulted in significant reduction in lymphocyte and triglyceride drain output. However, the effusion recurred over the following months. A repeat MR lymphangiogram showed clear improvement in the interstitial changes of the right lung. However, additional lymph vessels draining into the left lung and pleural space were identified. A second lymphatic embolization was performed, following which only a small amount of pleural fluid returned. This has been unchanged for 3 years (figure 1B), with excellent functional status under maintenance treatment with Sirolimus alone. Discussion: In our patient, MR lymphangiography followed by targeted lymphatic embolization procedures aborted aggressive progression of a lymphatic pleural effusion. Although KLA is a systemic proliferative disease, our case demonstrates that this \"mechanical approach\" might change the natural course of the disease. A) Chest x-ray before lymphatic interventions (May 2015) showing a large pleural effusion with mediastinal shift. B) Chest x-ray following two lymphatic embolization procedures employing glue and coils. A small left pleural effusion and right sided port-a-cath are seen.

They are sometimes classified by where they form in the lung, central or peripheral. There are 2 types of lung carcinoid tumors: typical and atypical. Rarely, they release sufficient hormone-like substances into the bloodstream to cause symptoms. The present case is an adolescent Chilean boy, 13 years old. He suffered four obstructive bronchitis episodes during 2017 diagnosed as asthma. He was started with fluticasone + salmeterol twice a day, salbutamol SOS and desloratadine daily. Despite the treatment, he had weakness, wheezing, cough which was sometimes bloody. No family history of hemorrhagic disease. In August 2017, the patient attended the emergency service because of hemoptysis. He was admitted into the hospital. Pulmonary tuberculosis was suspected. He stayed at the pediatric service for 1 week. He was stabilized; he was sent home to complete the tests as outpatient. TB infection and atypical bacterial infections with Ziehl-Neelsen tests were negative. The chest X-rays were reported as normal. PCR in bronchial secretion for atypical and TB mycobacterium were negative. Respiratory viruses were (-). Bacterial cultures in bronchial secretion (-). Blood culture was (-). Blood cell count and Shilling formula were normal. A chest computed tomography with contrast confirmed an endobronchial hypervascular tumor in intermediate bronchi. The fiber-optic bronchoscopy confirmed the tumor. The biopsy was performed by open lung surgery, there were no lymph nodes involved. The middle lobe and the right lower lobe were excised because of obstruction of the lumen, with failure of re-expansion. The biopsy was negative for atypical cells, confirming neuroendocrine tumor grade I: Positive immunohistochemical staining for Chromogranin (Cg) and Synaptophysin, (+) TTF1, (+) Ki67, (-) Keratin AE1/ AE3. No possibility for octeocride test before or after surgery. The boy is now under control in oncology, pediatric pulmonology, endocrine unit and continues with respiratory rehabilitation exercises.

Pediatric Pulmonology, Philippine General Hospital -Manila, Philippines Chronic arsenic poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms of which the most commonly reported are dermatological and neurological although pulmonary complications have also been seen. Here we present a 17 year-old male who came from Lubang Pampanga where there are known cases of chronic arsenic poisoning from a previously identified water source. The patient's symptoms included chronic cough, bipedal edema, and worsening difficulty of breathing. On admission, the patient was tachypneic, tachycardic, with O2 saturations as low as 70%-80% on room air. The patient had digital clubbing, multiple hyperkeratotic papules on the palms and soles, with melanosis more prominent on the lower extremities. Other family members also had the same skin lesions but did not present with respiratory complaints. Arsenic levels were analyzed from urine and bronchoalveolar lavage samples which were both low. Chest CT scan showed extensive bronchiectatic changes in both lungs. O-131 | ABO-incompatible Lung Transplantation in Infants with Surfactant Protein Deficiencies Solomon M. 1 , De Perrot M. 2 , Keshavjee S. , Lung Transplant Program, University Health Network -Toronto, Canada Surfactant dysfunction disorders can present as severe diffuse lung disease of the newborn, leading to progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and are often fatal in early infancy. Lung transplantation is the only definitive therapy for these patients however, limited availability of suitable donors and high waitlist mortality often prevent transplantation. One strategy to increase organ availability for infants is to perform ABO-incompatible (ABO-i) transplants, a strategy that was previously established in infant heart transplantation. We performed the world's first successful ABO-i lung transplantation in an infant (Grasemann H et al, Am J Transplant. 2012;12:779-81). We report here on the Hospital for Sick Children experience of three consecutive infant ABO-i lung transplantations for surfactant dysfunction disorders. All three patients are alive and current follow-up ranges from 7.5 to 2.5 years. Of the three patients, two had genetically confirmed surfactant protein-B deficiency and one had a diagnosis of ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 3 (ABCA3) deficiency. All received a double lung transplant and the surgeries were performed on cardiac bypass. Donor/recipient blood groups were B-/A1 + in one, and A+ /O+ in two patients. An intraoperative plasma exchanges of 1.5 times the infant's blood volume was the only preparatory procedure performed. Isohemagglutinins were monitored before transplant and regularly during follow-up. Immunosuppressive therapy included basiliximab (induction) on day 0 and day 4 post-op, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil. Tacrolimus was added at post-op day 5 to 7. All patients remained on relatively low-doses of triple maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. Investigations to monitor lung grafts during follow-up included surveillance suggests that ABO-i lung transplantation for severe surfactant dysfunction disorders is a suitable therapeutic option resulting in long term survival. ABO-i lung transplantation should also be considered for other fatal diffuse lung diseases in infancy.

Pediatrics, Taipei Veterans General Hospital -Taipei, Taiwan; 2 Institute of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, National Yang-Ming University -Taipei, Taiwanc Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is one of the most challenging conditions in treating critical infants and children. There is still no conclusive recommendation regarding the ideal ventilator mode to treat PARDS. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is considered as an alternative ventilator mode for patients with moderate-to-severe PARDS. The risk of mortality of PARDS is thought to be more related to underlying disease processes than the ventilator mode. Sepsis due to various infections is a common cause of PARDS. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection. It is relatively common in immunocompromised patients, including HIV-",

The true incidence is probably underestimated because of its varying presentations, ranging from mild respiratory distress to acute right-heart failure and cardiovascular collapse. The standard of management of lifethreatening thrombotic events in neonates is not established. The options include use of anticoagulation therapy alone and addition of thrombolytics. We report a case of a neonate with symptomatic PA thrombosis successfully treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (RTPA). A full term neonate male was born by normal vaginal delivery and had birth weight of 2,5 kg. Antenatal history was significant for gestational diabetes, arterial hypertension.

The diagnosis of pulmonary thrombosis was made, and anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin(LMWH)    was started. Infant's clinical status did not improve. The patient's condition was critical. It was decided to start thrombolytic therapy with RTPA (Tenecteplase \"Metalyse\") 0,2 mg/kg. Dose was repeated after 6 hours. The follow-up echocardiogram after 6 hours showed thrombus size reduction from 21 mm to 4,5 mm. PA pressure was near normal. Thrombolytic therapy was stopped and replaced with continuous intravenous heparin therapy for 72 hours followed by subcutaneous LMWH.Thrombolytic therapy complicated with the development of bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage. The formation of occlusive hydrocephaly was excluded by brain MRI.At the 30 day of life patient was discharged. Echocardiogram demonstrated completely dissolved thrombus with normalization of pulmonary pressure. Cranial ultrasound showed partial lysis of trombotic masses. Daily LMWH heparin was continued for 3 months.Genetic analysis showed homozygous polymorphisms in genes of inhibitor of the activator of a plazminogen (PAI-1) and a platelet collagen receptor.Follow up at the age of two years showed no residual or recurrent thrombus in the PA or other systemic vessels. His neurologic status now is normal. Conclusion: PA thrombosis is a rarely reported complication in neonates. Considering the potentially lethal nature of pulmonary embolism, pediatricians and neonatologists should maintain a high degree of suspicion for thrombotic events in infants with sudden inexplicable deterioration in cardiorespiratory status. In our case thrombolysis was a life-saving treatment. O-168 | Treatment of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis -Pediatric Case Report Minic P. 1 , Subarevic V. 2 , Bokonjic D. Institute for Child and Mother Care Belgrade -Belgrade, Serbia; 3 Department of Pediatrics, University clinical hospital -Foca, Bosnia-Herzegovina Introduction: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is rare condition usually caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11. It occurs in children younger than 5 years. HPV attacks the mucosal basal layer and induces cellular proliferation. Papillomatosis is very often predilected to the larynx but may be present anywhere in the respiratory tract. Purpose of the case was to show the course of the disease after using different therapeutic options. Case Report: 19-month-old child, male, admitted to the Institute for Child and Mother Care Belgrade, for dysphonia, stridor, shortness of breath and tachypnea worsening during cry, physical activity and at night. Child was without fever at all times. Two months before onset of symptoms, he often vomited after mA. eals. Antenatal history was insignificant. This was the second child from the second pregnancy, vaginally delivered on time with birth weight of 3800 grams, birth length 55 cm, vaccinated on time with proper psychomotor development. There were no respiratory symptoms in the neonatal period. Family history was unremarkable. On admission: body weight 10 kg (P5), using auxiliary respiratory muscles, and audible inspiratory stridor, without fever or cyanosis. RF 38/min, SpO2 96%. Remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory analyses (CBC, biochemistry, CRP) were in the reference range. Chest X-ray: areas of lung consolidation were observed as scattered opacification in the right lower lobe and around the hilum. Barium swallow test showed dilatation of the distal two thirds of the thoracic segment of the esophagus and extended evacuation and retention of contrast. Lymphoid hyperplasia of the hypopharynx with obstruction of supraglottis and glottis with tumor masses were seen on flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Biopsy of the papilloma was performed and HPV type 11 was identified. Esophagoscopy showed papilloma on the anterior wall of the upper esophagus. After admission to hospital, treatment with Acyclovir was started with little success. Several excisions using carbon dioxide laser failed to prevent spread of papilloma to trachea and bronchi. After the episode of severe respiratory distress, urgent tracheostomy was performed and interferon (IFN) 2\u03b1 was introduced, without significant improvement. Laryngeal microdebrider was then was applied for the treatment of laryngeal and intra-tracheal lesions. The intervention required simultaneous use of flexible endoscope to visualize the lesions and rigid instrument to introduce the debrider. The \"Shaving-off\" of the papillomas reduced their number and dimensions in both trachea and bronchi. Radical improvement was seen only after antiviral Cidofovir had been intralesionally injected into remaining papilloma of larynx, trachea and bronchi with the needle commonly used for aspiration biopsies. Conclusion: The treatment of recurrent juvenile papillomatosis is challenging especially in case of metastatic disease and even more in little child where the dimensions of the airways limit the choice of instruments. We present the successful use of microdebridement and intralesional injection of cidofovir in the treatment of laryngotracheo-bronchial papillomatosis in a two-year old.

Department of Pediatrics, Saiful Anwar General Hospital / Universitas Brawijaya -Malang, Indonesia increase in morbidity, mortality and also hospital length of stay in pediatric patients. Despite the current development of diagnostic tools and treatment, limited resources countries still find it difficult to provide these modalities. Case presentation: We report four cases of parapneumonic pleural effusion in pediatric patients. The patients' ages (2 male, 2 female) ranged from 1 to 10 years. Three patients presented with dyspnea as their chief complaint and only one patient had chest pain as a chief complaint. The diagnosis of parapneumonic pleural effusion was established from clinical findings and chest radiography. Three patients had necrotizing pneumonia and one of them had already been treated with antituberculosis drugs 2 months before admission. Upon the patients' arrival in the emergency department, we performed pleural fluid analysis and culture. We managed these patients with antibiotics and nonoperative surgical procedure in most cases. Broad spectrum antibiotics were already administered in all cases before they were referred to our hospital. All of the pleural fluid culture results were sterile due to prior administration of antibiotics. Chest tube insertion was performed on the first day of admission in all cases: two patients had only chest tube drain placement, one patient had chest tube insertion and fiber-optic bronchoschopy and one patient had chest tube insertion followed by open thoracotomy and decortication. Conclusion: The clinical presentation of parapneumonic pleural effusion may vary in each case. Management of parapneumonic pleural effusion in limited resources country is becoming much more challenging and more patient-specific. Most cases of parapneumonic pleural effusion that we reported here have favorable outcomes. Keywords: Parapneumonic pleural effusion, pneumonia, limited resources country.

            "text": "Embolization 4 days later was abandoned as there was no identifiable feeding vessel. The pseudoaneurysm appeared echogenic and smaller with no color flow, thus it was assumed to be thrombosed. Hernasopharyngeal culture grew Elizabethkingia meningoseptica. Her condition improved with a course of ceftriaxone and gentamicin. She was discharged well after 25 days of hospitalization. Serial follow-up CXRs and ultrasound scans showed spontaneous resolution of the pseudoaneurysm. Patient B was a 17-year-old boy with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and epilepsy who presented with five-month history of cough and intermittent hemoptysis. Clinically, he was cachexic with scoliosis and multiple joint contractures. He was mildly tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/minute. There were reduced breath sounds over his left lung. A CXR showed air space nodular opacities at the left upper lobe and patchy consolidation over both lung fields. He had a positive Mantoux test. His gastric lavage was smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli, and a culture later grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. He was commenced on antituberculous medications on day three of admission. However, his hemoptysis persisted and worsened despite over 2 weeks of treatment and his hemoglobin dropped from 8.8g/dL to 6.4g/dL requiring blood transfusion. A CT angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm and multiple adjacent cavitating lesions over the left upper lobe with no feeding vessel seen. In view of the potential high mortality and morbidity, and increased technical complexity of interventional management due to the underlying comorbidities, he was treated conservatively. The hemoptysis resolved after 4 weeks of anti-TB treatment and he was subsequently discharged home. A follow-up CXR 3 months later showed resolving pseudoaneurysm. Conclusion: Although pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms are uncommon, knowledge of their existence and association with infective lung diseases is important. Recognition of unusual abnormalities on imaging studies can lead to early diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis is often made by CT angiography and embolization is the treatment of choice. O-183 | Middle Aortic Syndrome Presenting as Pulmonary Edema, 3-Month-Old Boy: Case Report Ikeyama S., Kawabe T., Monoi A. Yokoyama S., Takahashi K., Yokoyama Y. Pediatrics, Oume Municipal General Hospital -Tokyo, Japan Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a congenital malformation of the aorta that is a relatively common defect. However, middle aortic syndrome (MAS), an uncommon condition . Ultrasound cardiography (UCG) was conducted for assessment of cardiac function. UCG identified a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (36%) and moderate atrioventricular valve regurgitation. There was no stenosis in the descending thoracic aorta. However, his echocardiogram identified segmental narrowing of the abdominal aorta, which caused cardiac hypofunction. His upper limb BP was 118/76 mm Hg and lower limb BP was 77/44 mm Hg. The cause of the seizures was considered to be posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Since surgical operation was necessary, he was transferred to a tertiary referral children's hospital. At 10-months old, catheter surgery for intravascular stenosis was performed successfully. Vasculitis, such as Takayasu's arteritis, can be stated as a differential diagnosis; however, finding of vasculitis was all negative. One year after initial presentation, the patient was fine. This report describes a rare case of CoA, MAS. Chest X-ray and UCG could result in leading to diagnosis, even if it does not appear to be a cardiovascular disease based on symptoms.

This is the first case of empyema caused by this agent in our center.Case Report: An 8-year-old boy with no past medical history, presented with 3 weeks of right-sided chest pain that radiated to right shoulder. No fever, respiratory symptoms or history of trauma were recorded. Initial diagnosis by Orthopedics was a musculoskeletal pain treated with antiinflammatory medications without improvement. Subsequently, he was admitted at the emergency department with persistent chest pain for further investigations.",

S. mitis strains may cause endocarditis and bacteremia, and infections have been increasing probably because of acquisition of new virulence factors. Management of empyema in children is controversial, and although fibrinolytic agents and surgical interventions are commonly recommended, our patient improved with drainage and IV antibiotics with no further procedures. Conclusion: Complicated pneumonia and empyema remain common high burden infections in children. Unusual clinical presentations represent a true challenge and changing epidemiology and etiology may interfere with a timely diagnosis. Since the publication of S. mitis genome, understanding the rise in cases of infections is currently under investigation. O-186 | Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia as the Initial Presentation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in a Korean Adolescent Kang S. Y. 1 , Kim S. Y. 1 , Choi S. H. 1 , Sol I.

Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine -Seoul, South Korea; 2 Department of Pediatrics, Sowha Children's Hospital -Seoul, South Korea Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is characterized histologically by the formation of granulation-tissue plugs within the lumens of small airways. It was reported in association with various disorders including infection, drug reactions and collagen vascular diseases. However, there are only rare reports of BOOP accompanied with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially in the pediatric population. Herein, authors report a case of an adolescent with SLE who initially manifested respiratory illnesses due to BOOP. A 14-year-old girl referred to our clinic for a protracted cough with fever, dyspnea and hemoptysis. Her chest X-ray revealed predominant multifocal consolidations in bilateral lung fields with pleural effusion. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed surrounding ground-glass opacities with the crazy-paving appearance with multiple centrilobular nodules suggesting diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, low serum levels of complements and positivity for antinuclear antibody, p-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and anti-double stranded DNA antibody. To exclude the possibilities of vasculitis and other mixed connective tissue diseases, video-assisted thoracic surgery biopsy was performed. treatment, and the patient is now doing well without a relapse. This pediatric case of BOOP as the initial presentation of SLE brings the need for more attention to the pulmonary manifestations of SLE in children. O-194 | Cutis Laxa: A Case Report Sofiah F., Yangtjik K., Aruf A. Department of Child Health Medical School, Sriwijaya University, Dr. Mohammad Hoesin Hospital -Palembang, Indonesia Background: Cutis laxa (CL) is a rare disease, a heterogeneous group of genetic and acquired connective tissue disorders caused by mutations in the elastin and fibulin-5 genes. Congenital forms of cutis laxa are more common than acquired disease. Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and x-linked recessive patterns have been described, with the recessively inherited form being the most frequent and most severe. Cutis laxa is characterized by a generalized reduction in the amount and size of elastic fibers and fragmentation and disruption of their normal arrangement, progressive looseness of the skin associated with abnormalities of other organs and structures containing elastic tissue such as lung, vasculature or gastrointestinal tract. The most clinical feature is loose and pendulous skin, sagging of the cheeks, or prematurely aged appearance. This disease is often associated with severe internal complications such as emphysema leading to cor pulmonale and death in the first few years of life. Emphysema in autosomal dominant CL is caused by heterozygous elastin gene mutations. Cutis laxa shows increased lung compliance and decreased stiffness of lung tissue. Combined effects of these processes lead to the development of an emphysematous pulmonary phenotype in CL. Case: An 8-month-old girl presented with cough and shortness of breath, inguinal lump, weight loss, sagging in almost entire part of the body. There had a history of recurrent episodes of cough and breathlessness since age of 4 months, with an increase in the frequency and severity of the episodes in the last weeks. The patient has a sister with the same condition who already passed away. On examination, the child had fever, tachypnea, dyspnea with intercostal and subcostal retractions. The respiratory rate was 55x/min, heart rate 105/min, and SaO2 was 95% using 2l% of oxygen supplementation. Weight and height were 5.7 kg (< -2DS) and 66 cm (0-(-2)DS), the nutritional status was malnourished. The face had a senile appearance with sagging cheek, pendulous ear lobes and lax skin. There were rales and retractions on chest examinations; the cardiovascular system was normal. There were umbilical hernia and inguinal hernia. The laboratory findings showed an anemia, leukocytosis and increase in C-reactive protein. Other examinations such as electrolyte, thyroid hormone, renal and liver function were within normal limits. A chest X-ray showed bilateral emphysema, pneumomediastinum. Pediatrics, Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital -Taipei, Taiwan; 2 Department of Respiratory Therapy, Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital -New Taipei City, Taiwan Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an ideal tool for assessing many diseases in the neonatal brain including neurodevelopment disorder and congenital airway disease and modality for defining extrinsic airway abnormalities. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) infants with ventilator dependency (VD) are at risk for undergoing MRI, especially those receiving anesthetic care with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) support. There are technical issues that need to be overcome before using the MRIventilator as NIV support in the MRI room. The aim of this case report is to share an experience of practice in NIV support on infants with VD during MRI.",

The evolution was initially good, with fever reduction and reduced cough intensity and frequency. After 2 weeks, the biochemistry showed the persistence of an elevated ESR and CRP; she was referred to the national CF center. At admission, she was started on vancomycine with the suspicion of a resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and inflammatory indices decreased and the 'wait and see' attitude was adopted, without the repetition of CT. Another cardiology evaluation was performed for a new tachycardia episode and a reduced cardiacpartial movement was noticed. The lung ultrasound revealed the presence of a large vascularized tumor located in the left lower lobe, without signs of consolidation or pleural effusion. The biopsy revealed an Askin tumor with costal debut. Conclusion: Not every cough or fever in a child with cystic fibrosis signifies an exacerbation; likewise, not every apparent consolidation with pleural effusion is a pneumonia. A more incisive investigational approach should be considered in a CF child with persistent inflammation. 15 | MISCELLANEOUS N-1 | Management of Home Emergencies for Children on Home Mechanical Ventilation (HMV) Kun S. S., Ward S. L., Keens T. G. Pediatric Pulmonology, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles -Los Angeles, California, USA Background and significance: It is estimated that 4800 children living in the USA are currently supported by mechanical ventilation at home. In spite of advances in technology, the mortality rate of 27.5% and 21% remains high. Previous studies identified a knowledge gap in the responses to emergencies in the home. Therefore care providers need to know the types of home emergencies and how to respond appropriately in the home setting. Purpose / aims of the study: The Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) approached regional home clinicians and formed an advisory panel to address HMV emergency management. Methods: We consulted 28 clinicians who are HMV clinical experts: 9 home respiratory care practitioners, 9 home health clinical nurses, 3 parents, 2 pulmonologists, 4 hospital nurse clinicians and 1 inpatient respiratory care practitioner. Phase I: the experts participated in an online survey, recalling the emergencies they had encountered in their career. Phase II: the expert advisory panel gathered for a one-day focus group workshop to discern all the emergency scenarios and responses in detail. Data collection procedures: The final curriculum is a summation of the most commonly encountered home emergencies recalled by this expert panel with 412 years of experience. Home emergencies were recalled; they were categorized according to the type of emergency scenarios. In post data analysis, the expert panel shared clinical experience on each scenario via the",

General Pediatric Department, University Children's Hospital Muenster -of longitudinal lung function data needed to characterize the course of pulmonary disease is poor. Methods: We analyzed lung function data from a European PCD registry (BESTCILIA project). The lung function course (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) was analyzed by linear mixed model analyses for repeated measures (SPSS, V24.0). Results: Three hundred and six spirometries in 127 patients (463.4 patient-years) with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD were evaluated. Fifty-nine patients (47.2 %) were male, 61 (48.8%) had situs inversus. 45 (35.4%) patients had a defect of the outer and/or inner dynein arms, in 69 patients (54.3%) the diagnosis was confirmed genetically. Mean FEV1-z-score and FVC-z-score were -1.93 (SD 1.75) and -1.39 (SD 1.94), respectively. The mean annual decline of FEV1-z-score and FVC-z-score was 0.041 (SD 0.01) and 0.044 (SD 0.01), and for the subgroup of PCD with microtubular defects, the mean annual decline was 0.054 (SD 0.05) and 0.027 (SD 0.07), respectively. Conclusions: The annual decline in FEV1 and FVC in PCD is substantial and comparable to the lung function decline in patients with cystic fibrosis. PCD variants with microtubular defects have an increased annual decline in FEV1-z-score and a decreased annual decline in FVC-z-score. This suggests that PCD subgroups have different patterns of lung function course. PCD registries are a useful tool to characterize the clinical course of PCD and PCD variants.

H. Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital -Kaohsiung, Taiwan Background: Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) refers to any congenital cardiac defect (CHD) with intracardiac communication that leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension, reversal of flow, and cyanosis. The previous left-to-right shunt is converted into a right-to-left shunt secondary to elevated pulmonary artery pressures and associated pulmonary vascular disease. It is only suggested to treat functional class (FC) III patients with ES with bosentan. In this study, we retrospectively reassessed the clinical outcome, cardiac hemodynamics, quality of life and complications in ES patients by advanced vasodilators during the long-term follow up.

N-113 | Analysis of the Impact of a Specially Designed Annubar Probe (digithal\u00ae) Inserted into a VHC, Using IVIVC Testing Systems Curran E., Kazmierczak J., Por\u00e9e T. R&D, Laboratoire ProtecSom/OptimHal -Valognes, France Statement: Using a system for improved In Vitro -In Vivo Correlations (IVIVCs) of Inhaled Drug Products, the ability of the Annubar probe (AP) to properly analyze respiratory flow and its impact on valved holding chamber (VHC) performance were checked. Methods: Aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) and emitted mass (EM) were measured during simulated tidal breathing using IVIVC testing systems. USP throat was connected to a Breath Simulator (BS2000, Copley) and the next generation impactor (NGI) by means of a T-piece. A constant flow through the NGI cascade impactor was balanced with a pressurized air source, resulting in simulated tidal breathing through the VHC and constant air flow through the cascade impactor. The pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) was shaken for 5 seconds and then fired into the spacer at the beginning of the inspiration. Five actuations were performed with 7 full breathing cycle intervals between puffs. Each experiment was performed five times. Respiratory flow analysis was measured during all the experiments using AP inserted into the mouthpiece of the VHC and a differential pressure sensor (SDP610, Sensirion). An electronic card linked to the sensor converted the pressure variation into a flow rate (Bernoulli's Principle).",

No significant change in GSDs, FPD5\u00b5m and FPF (P values< 0.05) were noticed. According to these results, the mass distribution of Salbutamol remained stable with or without AP. Conclusion: Results show that within the scope of our in vitro experiment, insertion of an Annubar Probe directly into the mouthpiece of the valve holding chamber allows a precise, instantaneous and reproducible measurement of the respiratory flow during the use of the inhalation chamber. Using the IVIVC technique, we were able to test this probe in conditions close to normal use. It was therefore pointed out that the pMDI actuation did not disturb flow measurement, and that presence of the pitot probe inside the mouthpiece did neither affect the VHC characteristics (ASPD) nor treatment delivery (EM). Reflection: Annubar Probe inserted into a VHC mouthpiece could potentially lead to the development of new devices capable of analyzing patients' respiratory cycles during VHC use (inspiratory and expiratory phases, inhalation flow rate, etc.). This information could instruct the patient, leading to an improvement of his/her inhalation technique over time (Kamps 2007).

R&D, Laboratoire ProtecSom/OptimHal -Valognes, France Statement: The following experiments were aimed at characterizing valve operation and its impact on drug delivery, by measuring valve resistance, ability to close and emitted mass of drug. Methods: Because different valve configurations require different mouthpiece shapes and volumes (ranging from 10.5 to 21.5 ml), six custom-built VHCs were developed differing only by their inspiratory valves and mouthpieces. The six inspiratory valves had different weights, materials and shapes. Valve resistance (cmH20/L/s) was measured by differential pressure analysis at different flow rates (from 5 to 60 L/min). The ability of the inspiratory valve to close was determined by measuring flow rates with flowmeters placed on both mouthpiece and backpiece of the VHC for different breathing patterns (Child, Adult USP). Delivery of fluticasone propionate (Flixotide 50 \u00b5g, GSK) to a filter (emitted dose, ED) was assessed for each custom-built chamber using a breathing simulator (Copley Scientific) simulating coordinated and uncoordinated pediatric use (Child USP pattern).",

Three showed average resistance and one little resistance to low flow inhalation flow rate. All blocked exhaled air properly except one. The other two VHCs showed lower ED compared to the others. One showed little resistance to low inhalation flow rates and could only partially block exhaled air, while the other could close completely but showed high resistance to inspiration at low flow rate. Lower drug output can be explained by high resistance to low flow rate, causing poor opening of the valve at the beginning of the inspiration, and the valve not closing during expiration, causing exhalation inside the chamber. Reflection: The main role of a VHC is to improve inhaled drug delivery. Given the preponderant role of inspiratory valves in the proper functioning of VHCs, it is essential to properly analyze their characteristics, especially at low flow rates. Inspiratory valves must function effectively To not compromise drug delivery. Therefore, it is important to consider it properly when choosing a VHC, especially for children.

Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea -Seoul, South Korea The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic factors related with mortality in pediatric hemato-oncology patients admitted for pulmonary complications on the ICU. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients below 21 years old with underlying hemato-oncologic diseases admitted for pulmonary complications at the ICU of a tertiary referral hospital in Korea between April 2009 and March 2017. ICU for pulmonary complications. The median age was 13 (IQR, 8-16) years old, and 62 (56.3%) were boys. The median duration of ICU hospitalization was 8 (IQR, 4.25-16) days, and 45 patients (40.9%) were applied mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate was 59.1% (65/110 patients). Factors with a significant association with increased mortality in a multivariable logistic regression analysis were as follows: low GCS scores, low SpO2/ FiO2 ratio, low hematocrit levels, and increasing total bilirubin levels. The pSOFA score and PELOD score assessed on the third day of admission had significant discrimination for in-ICU mortality with an area under the curve of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80-0.95) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92), respectively. The GCS score, SpO2/FiO2 ratio, hematocrit level, total bilirubin level, pSOFA scores and PELOD scores are useful factors for the prediction of an increased risk of mortality in pediatric hematooncology patients with pulmonary complication.

Background: Hospitalization rates for pediatric empyema have increased in the US, UK and Australia despite declining rates of hospital admission for community-acquired pneumonia. Several RCTs comparing primary interventions (CDF vs. VATS) have shown no difference in clinical outcomes.Objectives: This retrospective cohort study included admitted patients requiring intervention for empyema. Across 2011-2018, admission rates to hospital and intensive care were analyzed for trends in incidence and disease severity. Outcomes were compared between primary CDF and VATS. We compared associations with treatment failure and reintervention following primary CDF.Results: One hundred and ninety-five patients were included, 176 with primary CDF and 18 with VATS. Rates of hospital and ICU admission increased during the study. We report a difference in chest drain duration (-68h, 95%CI 14.6h-121.4h, p = 0.01), postoperative length of stay (-3.9d (95% CI 0.14-7.66, p = 0.05) and reintervention rate (6% vs. 28%, p = 0.04) in favor of VATS.

Of the latter, 428 patients born between 1992 through 2012 and treated at the 10 high-volume centers (194 prenatally and 234 postnatally diagnosed) were furthermore reviewed with pathological and statistical analysis. Based on these results and the systematic literature review, a revised classification and a treatment guideline for CCLD were drafted. Results: The present classification divides CCLDs into 5 major subtypes according to the embryological background; 1) pulmonary airway malformations including congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), 2) lung bud malformations including intra-and extra-lobar bronchopulmonary sequestration, 3) foregut malformations including bronchiogenic cyst, 4) bronchial atresia (BA), and 5) the others. Pathological analysis indicated that 37.5% of the BA cases showed CPAM type 2-like lesions such as microcystic maldevelopment and parenchymal maldevelopment of the pulmonary hyperplasia that should be distinguished from CPAM. Among the patients who were previously diagnosed to have intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration, a cohort of patients who showed bronchi facing in the opposite direction of the accessory lung bud in the resected lung were excluded from the lung bud malformations. Thus, the eligibility of each subtype was clarified, and the hybrid or combined lesions of the different subtypes were actively excluded in the present classification. In the survey, casually 10%-15% of the prenatally diagnosed patients seemed to carry a high risk for critical perinatal features such as fatal hydrops and neonatal respiratory distress. The fetal lung lesion volume ratio was significantly higher among these symptomatic patients compared to the asymptomatic patients (2.04\u00b11.71 vs. 0.98\u00b10.50, P < 0.00071). CPAM appeared to be more strongly associated with these critical features compared to other subtypes, when the eligibility of CPAM was properly assessed. Among the asymptomatic neonatal patients, 56.3% developed infectious symptoms before the age of 2 years. The prenatally diagnosed patients acquired significantly higher %VC when operated earlier than those diagnosed postnatally (98.3\u00b111.9 vs. 81.7\u00b19.7, P < 0.0222). Persistent cystic lesion in the lung required further surgical intervention in 4 patients, whereas carcinogenesis was not observed in the series. Conclusions: Based on these observations and the systematic literature review, fetal MRI assessment, an early surgery during the infantile period and avoidance of pneumonectomy were recommended especially in the patients with CPAM in the present guideline. D-106 | Congenital Laryngomalacia in Children: Clinical Characteristics and the Risk for its Severity Kim H. Y., Jung S. Department of Pediatrics, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital -Yangsan-si, South Korea Background: Laryngomalacia (LM) is the most common cause of stridor and dyspnea in newborn infants. The aim of this study is to determine whether LM types are related to clinical course and which factors are related to higher risk for severe forms of LM. Methods: A retrospective study of pediatric cases in a tertiary referral center was performed from January 2014 to June 2018. Electronic charts were reviewed for patients diagnosed as having LM and a total 201 patients were included. Results: LM occurred predominantly in males (n = 140, 69.7%). The median age at the time of diagnosis was 3.1 months. Type I was the most common morphological type (n = 140, 69.7%), followed by type II (n = 90, 44.8%) and type III (n = 47, 23.4%). The proportions of combined types of LM and synchronous airway lesion were 35.8% (n = 72) and 34.3% (n = 69), respectively. The severity of LM was classified as mild (n = 111), moderate (n = 47), and severe (n = 43).Factors with significant differences according to the severity of LM included inpatient consult, LM type III, combined types of LM, synchronous airway lesion, previous endotracheal intubation, previous surgery, neurological impairment, congenital heart disease, and syndrome/genetic disorders. Among these factors, significant determinants that influence LM severity were finally selected-inpatient consult (odds ratio [OR] 3.08, 95% confidential interval [CI] 1.57-3.11, P = 0.001), neurological impairment (OR, 3.21, 95% CI, 1.43-7.33, P = 0.005), LM type III (OR, 2.15, 95% CI, 1.06-4.39, P = 0.034), combined types of LM (OR, 3.08, 95% CI, 1.65-5.80, P < 0.001), and synchronous airway lesion (OR, 2.06, 95% CI, 1.08-3.94, P = 0.029). Conclusions: In children with LM, it is important to identify its severity. Risk factors for LM severity may be useful for clinicians in establishing management strategies and providing appropriate education for the caregivers.

Pediatric Pulmonology, National Center for Child Health and Development -Tokyo, Japan Introduction: Abnormal lung sounds, especially such as stridor, rhonchi and wheeze, are caused by a narrowed airway. As a nature of children, their airways are narrow, and easily collapsed in various diseases. So we must pay attention when diagnosing children with abnormal lung sounds. Nevertheless, pediatricians often make mistakes in misdiagnosing congenital tracheal stenosis as laryngomalacia or asthma without considering the importance of these symptoms, because these are frequently encountered in daily practice, and most of the patients improve as they grow. It is a serious problem to have the diagnosis of tracheal stenosis delayed because of the pediatrician's confident way of thinking. Objective: To determine the frequency of congenital tracheal stenosis among patients who presented with continuous abnormal sounds on auscultation such as stridor, rhonchi and wheeze in our outpatient department. Methods: We carried out a retrospective study in which we analyzed clinical history, diagnosis and management of 226 patients who had presented with abnormal continuous lung sounds to our institute between October 2008 and October 2018. Abnormal lung sounds were defined as persisting for more than 3 weeks or having been repeated more than once. Diagnoses were made by clinical symptoms and chest X-ray. Paranasal sinuses and neck X-rays were taken when physicians judged them necessary. CT scans were performed when tracheal stenosis was suspected, as well as flexible laryngoscopy for almost all of the patients with stridor to confirm whether they had laryngomalacia or not. Results: A total of 226 patients (male: female= 153: 73) were included. The most common symptom was stridor in 104 patients, followed by wheeze/rhonchi in 62 patients, and biphasic abnormal sounds in 58 patients. In 2 patients, classification was impossible from their medical charts. Seventy patients were diagnosed as laryngomalacia, 25 patients with asthma, 18 patients with protracted bacterial bronchitis, and 16 patients with sinobronchitis. Eleven patients (4.8%) were diagnosed as congenital tracheal stenosis, all of whom were male. Two of them had vascular ring and one had pulmonary artery sling. Patients with Down syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and preterm low birth weight infants were included. All patients with congenital tracheal stenosis presented with biphasic abnormal sounds. The median age at diagnosis was 12 months (1 month to 5 years). The median delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 7 months (1 to 48 months). Seven of 11 cases were repeatedly treated as asthma before diagnosis. All patients were carefully managed especially to prevent respiratory tract infections after diagnosis, and only one patient needed mechanical ventilation for a short period when he suffered from bronchitis. Surgery for vascular rings was performed in 1 of 2 patients. None had undergone tracheoplasty. Discussion: Congenital tracheal stenosis is not a rare disease among patients with abnormal lung sounds. Prolonged and recurrent respiratory complaints in infancy or childhood should alert the pediatricians to the possibility of tracheal stenosis.

C. 2 , Yang Y. H. 3 Institute of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, National Yang-Ming University -Taipei, Taiwan; 2 Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Veterans General Hospital -Taipei, Taiwan; 3 School of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University -New Taipei, Taiwan Background: More than 99.5% of people living in Taiwan are covered by a national health insurance. Children younger than 18 years account for 20~25% of the general population, but the birth rate of newborns has gradually been getting lower during the past decade. Analysis on the changing patterns of children requiring intensive care is important for future children's medical policy plan. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of children treated in intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan from 2000 to 2013. Method: Systematic random samples from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database were analyzed. Using the 5% inpatient data claims during 2000 to 2013, children with records of ICU hospitalization were enrolled and divided into different age groups. The related age, diagnosis, cost, seasonality, and mortality rate were analyzed and compared to adults. Result: A total of 16,727 (1,195 \u00b1 117 cases/month) children having ICU records were enrolled, including 9,628 (57.6%) boys and 7,099(42.4%) girls. Among them, infants (0-11 months old) were the highest population (60.2%), and their most common diagnoses were neonatal respiratory problems, preterm birth/low birth weight, and jaundice. Small children (1-5 years old, 19.6%) and bigger kids (6-11 years old, 8.4%) had similar disease patterns, and congenital cardiac/vascular anomaly, respiratory failure/insufficiency, and pneumonia were common diagnoses. Adolescents (12-17 years old, 11.1%) had a markedly higher diagnostic rate in traumatic cranial hemorrhage than the other age groups. The top ICU hospitalization season was summer. The ICU mortality rate of children was around 4%-6% and had a decreasing trend. From 2000 to 2013, the children's ICU hospitalization rate significantly declined; however, the adults' ICU hospitalization rate obviously increased. As a result, the ratios of children's ICU care significantly declined from 14.6% to 6.9%. Conclusions: Children's ICU care needs in Taiwan gradually declined from 2000 to 2013. Infants are the largest population to have ICU care. Preterm births, neonatal respiratory or congenital cardiovascular diseases accounted for top ICU diagnoses, although traumatic brain injury rose in adolescents. Upgrading children's ICU care by targeting diseases of different age groups is important in any nation with an aging population.",

We hope to share our experience with the CIPP participants.N-2 | Curriculum Development and Training of Pediatric Home Mechanical Ventilation Emergencies for Home Care Providers Kun S. S., Ward S. L., Keens T. G. Pediatric Pulmonology, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles -Los Angeles, California, USA Background and significance: Of the more than 9.4 million children in the United States with special health care needs, few present with more challenges than those faced by children requiring home mechanical ventilation (HMV). It is estimated that 4800 children living in the USA are currently supported by mechanical ventilation at home. In spite of advances in technology, the mortality rate of 27.5 % and 21% remains high. Home health nurses did not perform well in studies related to emergency-based scenarios on tracheostomy management and ventilator alarms. Inpatient care providers do not have complete data of emergency reports at home.Purpose/aims of the study: We recognized that a curriculum developed by stakeholders at all levels was needed to address the types of emergencies encountered outside the hospital setting and what the response should be. As each state/hospital might have a different approach to the type of tracheostomy tube and ventilator for their HMV patients, we implemented a regional approach to collect data from local experts to create a curriculum for home care providers.Methods: We invited 28 experts who are HMV home clinical experts from inside and outside the hospital: 9 home respiratory care practitioners, 9 home health clinical nurses, 3 parents, 2 pulmonologists, 4 hospital nurse clinicians and 1 inpatient respiratory care practitioner to participate. These experts were asked to recall the emergencies they had encountered in their career and consensus was reached via the modified Delfi method.Data collection procedures: The final curriculum is a summation of the most commonly encountered home emergencies recalled by this expert panel with 412 years of experience. Home emergencies were categorized according to the type of emergency scenarios. In post data analysis, the advisory expert panel discussed the home emergencies in detail. Results: Ninety-two HMV emergency scenarios were recalled. Data categorized into 16 emergency situations. The expert panel deliberated on 1) the emergency situation 2) the immediate response 3) the possible causes and 4) pearlsthe collective sharing of experiences on these encounters. The tracheostomy and ventilator home emergency curriculum for home health nurses was finalized.Ventilator stopped with no warning Water in the circuit.Dissemination of information:To animate participation, we will provide an incentivized program by offering the first 150 home health nurses a gift card of $20 for their participation with 1 unit of CEU. We will perform a pre and posttest to capture the knowledge gain from this educational opportunity.Conclusion:We have created a curriculum for HMV emergencies.An innovative training module for HMV emergencies in SouthernCalifornia is underway to train home health nurses and parents.This curriculum represents all major stakeholders addressing home emergencies for pediatric HMV patients outside the hospital settings. Assess the child. Suction the trach tube gently. Use cold normal saline drops to clear aiway. Change the trach tube. Call 911 if airway is still not patent. Distinguish between blood-tinged mucus vs. frank bleeding from the trach tube. Bleeding non-stop necessitates ED visit. Clear coagulated blood by trach tube or circuit change. Seek advice of physician for possible antibiotics or flexible endoscopy. For bleeding from dryness: switch to a heated wire circuit. Check room temperature for condensation/rain out phenomenon.
