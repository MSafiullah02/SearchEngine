The review includes microorganisms used as source of feed additives and food enzymes for which EFSA has received or can potentially receive applications for safety assessment, and which have not been recommended for Qualified Presumption of Safety status. The database also comprises the molecular taxonomical identifiers and biosynthetic pathways involved in the production of toxic compounds and the responsible genes. The main result of the project is shown as a database developed according to the EFSA data structure. The methodological aspects and the queries used in the systematic search, as well as the procedure applied for the screening of scientific documents retrieved are described in this report.

It was observed that kojic acid induced diffuse hypertrophy and hyperplasia of thyroid follicular epithelial cells with decreased serum thyroxine levels in both p53 (+/-) and p53 (+/+) mice, but caused no thyroid tumors. In the liver, the incidence of altered hepatocellular foci and hepatocellular adenomas was significantly increased, and the heterozygous p53 (+/-) mice appeared to be more susceptible in terms of the tumorigenic dose of kojic acid, with a greater prevalence of hepatic proliferative lesions. Thus, the contribution of genotoxicity on hepatocellular tumor development could not be ruled out.",

It has been implicated in porcine nephropathy and has been found as a natural contaminant of corn, rice, wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Citrinin was classified as group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans) by IARC (IARC, 1987) and was more recently evaluated by EFSA (EFSA Journal 2012b). Citrinin is a polyketide that has been reported to be produced by the two fungal species P. citrinum, P. chrysogenum, but besides citrinin, a large number of citrinin derivatives have been isolated from different fungal species, citrinin decomposes during heat treatment to form other complex compounds, such as citrinin H1 and citrinin H2, respectively with higher and weaker cytotoxicity than the original citrinin.

Expression of the pks gene appears to be correlated with OTA production in A. niger; therefore this finding provides data to find a route for avoiding the production of OTA in industrial strains.

Most enzymes and genes related to the biosynthesis and export of lipopolysaccharide have been identified in E. coli, and they are shared by most Gram-negative bacteria based on available genetic information. However, the detailed structure of lipopolysaccharide differs from one bacterium to another, suggesting that additional enzymes that can modify the basic structure of lipopolysaccharide exist in bacteria, especially some pathogens. These structural modifications of lipopolysaccharide are sometimes tightly regulated. They are not required for survival but closely related to the virulence of bacteria.
