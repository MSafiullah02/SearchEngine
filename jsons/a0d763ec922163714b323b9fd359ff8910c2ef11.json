The aim was to identify new predictors for ARDS patient prognosis, including those with clinical, pathophysiological, and atypical immunodeficiency. Methods: ARDS patients were retrospectively included. The patients were grouped and analysed according to different oxygenation index grades and prognosis, and factors influencing prognosis and survival were examined. Adolescent patients, patients with typical immunodeficiency and patients who died within 24 h after being diagnosed with ARDS were excluded. The predictive value for mortality was determined by Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: In total, 201 patients who fulfilled the Berlin definition of ARDS were included. The severity of critical illness on the day of enrolment, as measured by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (P = 0.016), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (P = 0.027), and PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P = 0.000), worsened from mild to severe ARDS cases. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were significantly older and had higher APACHE II and SOFA scores. Moreover, significantly lower lymphocyte/neutrophil ratios and leukocyte counts were found among non-survivors than survivors (P = 0.008, P = 0.012). A moderate positive correlation between the lymphocyte/ neutrophil and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios (P = 0.023) was observed. In predicting 100-day survival in patients with ARDS, the area under the curve (AUC) for the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio was significantly higher than those for the PaO 2 / FiO 2 ratio alone, body mass index (BMI) alone, and the lymphocyte count alone (P = 0.0062, 0.0001, and 0.0154). Age (per log 10 years), BMI < 24, SOFA score, leukocyte count, and the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in ARDS patients. Additionally, ARDS patients with a lymphocyte/ neutrophil ratio < 0.0537 had increased 28-day mortality rates (P = 0.0283). Old age affected both 28-day and 100day mortality rates (P = 0.0064,0.0057).",

            "text": "Nonetheless, clinical and animal studies have shown that the activation of multiple inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators play important roles in the development and outcome of ARDS [5] . The involvement of immune cells, including neutrophils [6, 7] lymphocytes [8] , and regulatory T-cell [9, 10] , has become an active topic of research in ARDS pathogenesis. To date, few clinical studies on the immune status of ARDS patients have focused on aetiology, treatment and prognosis [11] . Immunocompromised individuals represent a significant proportion of ARDS patients [11, 12] , these patients do not have the ability to respond normally to an infection due to an impaired or weakened immune system. Some studies have shown that ARDS occurs in patients with previous immunodeficiencies, such as haematologic malignancies, active solid tumours, solid organ transplantation, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, as well as in patients taking long-term or high-dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, and those who use extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may have a better prognosis [13] . Compared with immunocompetent subjects, ARDS patients with typical immunodeficiency have higher mortality regardless of ARDS severity [11] . In addition, atypical immunosuppression is frequently found among ARDS patients, and virus infections are also increasingly being reported in ARDS patients without typical immunosuppression [13] . Overall, there is currently a lack of uniform molecular markers for patients with atypical immunosuppression or impaired status. Furthermore, it is not well known whether the status of atypical immunodeficiency affects the prognosis of ARDS. Managing patients with atypical immunosuppression in intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging, updated epidemiological and outcomes studies are needed to evaluate the condition of these patients. This aim of our study was to identify a convenient and easy-to-use molecular biomarker to detect and evaluate the status of patients with atypical immunosuppression in ARDS patients.",

Previous studies have focused on the poor prognosis of patients with severe lymphopenia from the first day of ICU admission [21] . In our study, peripheral blood lymphopenia was very common in ARDS patients without typical underlying diseases, causing immunosuppression. The number of peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased significantly in patients with severe ARDS, and in non-survivors also. Moreover, the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio progressively decreased with increasing ARDS severity, and a significantly lower lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio was found in non-survivors than in survivors.",

In our study, ARDS patients with a lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio < 0.0537 had a higher 28-day mortality rate than did those with a lymphocyte/ neutrophil ratio \u2265 0.0537. The lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio may reveal the balance between lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. Lymphocytes are important immune cells involved in response to ARDS and in prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that a decrease in the lymphocyte count was associated with a 2.32-3.76-fold increase in the risk of death among patients with or without septic shock [22] . In addition, both B-lymphocyte and CD8 + T-lymphocyte counts correlated positively with peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in our study, these counts in non-survivors were significantly lower than those in survivors, and the findings suggest increased risk of death in ARDS patients when the lymphocyte count decreases below a certain value. Neutrophils are another type of immune cell involved in the process of sepsis, and a relative increase in the total number of circulating neutrophils and the percent increase in neutrophils with immature morphology are also closely related to sepsis [23, 24] . Compared with counts in survivors, higher neutrophil counts were found in patients who eventually died as a result of sepsis-induced ARDS, and excessive accumulation of neutrophils in patients with ARDS may therefore contribute to disease progression [6, 8] . Therefore, the combination of lymphopenia and neutrophilia contributes to the outcome of ARDS, which may explain why the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio in our study was a strong independent predictor of prognosis.",

We further found that the lymphocyte/ neutrophil ratio AUC was higher than the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, BMI, APACHE II score, and SOFA score alone in predicting 100-day survival in ARDS patients. In combination with the lymphocyte count slightly increased the AUC of the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio in predicting 100-day survival, yet there was no difference compared with the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio alone. Moreover, ARDS patients with a lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio \u2265 0.0537 had a lower 28-day mortality rate, and significantly moderate negative correlations were found between the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio and age, the SOFA score, and the APACHE II score. In addition, a moderate positive correlation between the lymphocyte/ neutrophil ratio and the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was been noted. These results suggest that the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio can comprehensively and plausibly reflect the patient's physiological, pathophysiological and respiratory oxygenation index status. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio is a potential indicator and good indicator for prognosis evaluation among ARDS patients.",

Although it does not reach the level found in typical immunodeficiency, there is already a degree of immune impairment. Nonetheless, there are few studies on atypical immune deficiency or impaired immunity in ARDS patients, and there is no uniform scale or biomarker to measure immune impairment in ARDS patients and its relationship with prognosis. A consensus has not been reached regarding whether viral infection causes immune deficiency, though it is commonly thought to induce immune impairment but not to the extent of immune deficiency. In our study, there was no significant difference in viral infection status between the survivor and non-survivor groups. However, we did observe that the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio in the survivor group were higher than those in the non-survivor group.",
