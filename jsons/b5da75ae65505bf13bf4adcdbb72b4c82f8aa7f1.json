In hospitalized patients, mortality is reported to be approximately 25%, and in critically ill patients, who require mechanical lung ventilation mortality is between 65% and 85%. [1] [2] [3] Most patients who die progress to septic shock and half develop coagulopathy with progressively increasing D-dimer. 1 Age, coronary artery disease, and elevated D-dimer are independent predictors of mortality. 1 Several reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with coagulation derangements, particularly hypercoagulability, and that anticoagulation with heparin may improve survival. [4] [5] [6] In our own experience, we have noted marked hypercoagulability in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including thrombosis of renal replacement therapy filters and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits.",

When FVIII overwhelms activated protein C, prolonged thrombin generation can occur leading to hypercoagulability.

Prior studies have shown that interleukin (IL)-6 and other cytokines activate coagulation. 7,8 COVID-19 is associated with a profound inflammatory response in many patients that is characterized by high IL-6, fibrinogen, and ferritin concentrations. 1 COVID-19 is also associated with high D-dimer, suggesting extensive thrombin generation and fibrinolysis. 1 This pattern may reflect hypercoagulability related to severe inflammation. 9 Our case series demonstrates that some critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the United States have a coagulation profile characterized by severely elevated fibrinogen concentration and FVIII activity, as well as low normal antithrombin and functional protein C activity. This hypercoagulable pattern appears to be accentuated with age, particularly in men. These findings have similarities with and differences from a recent study by Panigada et al 9 where functional protein C activity was normal in most patients and mean FVIII activity was elevated to 297%. Mean fibrinogen concentration in their study was 680 mg/dL compared to 763 mg/dL in Upper limit of assay is 400% and 7 of 10 patients were at upper limit. c Upper limit of assay is 20,000 ng/mL FEU and 3 of 10 patients were at upper limit. our study. The authors did not explore the impact of age on coagulation profile and there were few details provided about the patients' comorbidities. We postulate that differences between the 2 studies could be related to a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome and other comorbidities among adults in the United States leading to more severe coagulation abnormalities.",

Hypercoagulability has been reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and there are recent reports of ischemic stroke and limb ischemia. 13, 14 Some patients with COVID-19 have been found to have antiphospholipid antibodies. 13 Our data suggest that an imbalance in the FVIII-protein C system also contributes to hypercoagulability. Given this imbalance, there may be a role for systemic anticoagulation or low-dose thrombolysis in some patients. Although not commercially available in the United States, recombinant thrombomodulin could be a potential treatment for hypercoagulable patients with COVID-19. It has immunomodulatory effects and increases protein C activation in the presence of thrombin. 15 There are no high-quality studies to support systemic anticoagulation at this time, but the observational study by Tang et al 6 strongly suggests that patients with an elevated D-dimer concentration have better survival when treated with anticoagulation.",
