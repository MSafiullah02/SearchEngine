As a consequence, cleaning and disinfecting hospital environments play an important role among strategies for preventing healthcare-associated colonization and infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether adenosine triphosphate (ATP) presence, measured by bioluminescence methods, can predict microbiological contamination of hospital surfaces. The study was carried out between September and December 2012 at the University Hospital \"P. Giaccone\" of Palermo. A total of 193 randomly selected surfaces (tables, lockers, furnishings) were sampled and analyzed in order to assess ATP levels (expressed as relative light units or RLU) and aerobic colony count (ACC) or presence of S. aureus. ACC had median values of 1.85 cfu/cm 2 (interquartile range = 4.16) whereas ATP median was 44.6 RLU/cm 2 (interquartile range = 92.3). Overall, 85 (44.0%) surfaces exceeded the established microbial benchmark: 73 (37.8%) exceeded the 2.5 cfu/cm 2 ACC standard, 5 (2.6%) surfaces were positive for S. aureus and 7 (3.6%) showed both the presence of S. aureus and an ACC of more than 2.5 cfu/cm 2 . ACC and bioluminescence showed significant differences in the different surface sites (p < 0.001). A significant correlation was found between ACC and RLU values (p-value < 0.001; R 2 = 0.29) and increasing RLU values were significantly associated with a higher risk of failing the benchmark (p < 0.001). Our data suggest that bioluminescence could help in measuring hygienic quality of hospital surfaces using a quick and sensitive test that can be an useful proxy of microbial contamination; however, further analysis will be necessary to assess the cost-efficacy of this methodology before requiring incorporation in hospital procedures.",

(1) As a consequence, cleaning and disinfecting hospital environments play an important role among strategies for preventing healthcare-associated colonization and infections. (2) A major problem in defining these recommendations is to classify when a surface can be considered \"clean\" and \"acceptable.\" Although, a large number of international guidelines provide for visual surface inspection for measuring cleanliness, (3) this method cannot be considered an accurate measure of surface cleanliness or of microbial contamination and previous studies have indicated that it may overestimate cleaning efficacy, (4) failing to predict the risk of infection for patients. (5) Several other tools and methods including microbiological methods (e.g., aerobic bacterial counts, culture of indicator organisms) and bioluminescence tests for assessing cleanliness on a more scientific basis have been proposed. Microbiological cultures are commonly thought to adequately describe the infectious risk attributable to contaminated surfaces but they are time-consuming, needing a minimum of 24 hours.",

As previously reported, visual assessment is probably the less accurate measure of surface cleanliness (4, 5) whereas microbiological assessments could be considered a reference method, being able to predict, at least theoretically, the risk of infection for patients. In the last decades several authors have proposed detection of ATP bioluminescence for quickly monitoring and having a standardized sensitive measure of hospital cleanliness. However, among the few studies that compared this method with microbiological cultures, a large majority found no correlation between RLU values and ACC. (13) (14) (15) Otherwise, a minority of authors reported a good agreement or a weak relationship between the two methods. (16, 17) Our results confirm the latter findings, suggesting that surfaces with low microbial contamination also had low bioluminescence and that RLU values could explain about one-third of the ACC variability. According to this observation, Griffith et al. found that about 33% of the ATP from hand contact surfaces is likely to be of microbial origin with the remainder non-microbial. (4) The fact that a part of measured bioluminescence is usually due to microbial presence could be useful in setting a minimum ATP value suggesting low microbial contamination. Furthermore, benchmark values of RLU 100, (17) 250, (9) and 500 RLU (3, 4, 14) for ATP testing have been proposed to identify surfaces with a significant bacterial contamination, as recommended by international guidelines. The present study shows that a certain number of surfaces with ATP values \u2264500 RLU could have a microbial contamination higher than 2.5 cfu/cm 2 or presence of S. aureus and, consequently, the use of such a benchmark could be questionable. Otherwise, our experiences suggest that, using Lumicontrol II, an ATP value of 100 RLU could be a better bioluminescence benchmark, having a low risk (<5%) of classifying as \"clean\" a significantly contaminated surface.",

Second, our study has not considered standardized experimental contamination but, instead, included surfaces cleaned by various personnel and highly contaminated by patients, personnel, and visitors. This last point can also be considered a strength since it describes the real surface situation in a hospital environment.",
