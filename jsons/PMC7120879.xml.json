Again, cross-reference with the history as described above is often useful. Gross vision problems may be noted here (or in CN exam section), including strabismus, exotropia, esotropia, or ambylopia. Strabismus is the lack of muscle co-ordination between the eyes. Exotropia refers to an eye being deviated away from midline (deviated outward), and is a form of strabismus. Esotropia refers to an eye being deviated towards the midline (deviated inward), and is a form of strabismus. Amblyopia refers to when the brain does not process visual signals of a misaligned eye (the eye that is exotropic or esotropic), resulting in vision being based on one eye and a patient losing depth perception.

The importance of the neurologic examination to neuropsychological evaluation cannot be overstated. The most important piece of information available to the consulting neurologist or neuropsychologist is a prior neurological examination noted in sufficient depth to reassure the examiner that it was performed with more than cursory inspection. The components of the Neurologic examination are elaborated below.\n\nMental status. This is frequently abbreviated as AO \u00d7 3 standing for alert, oriented to person, place, and time. Occasionally one may see orientation described as AO \u00d7 4 with the \u201c4\u201d referring to situation or circumstances. Just as commonly, one will see AAO \u00d7 3 (or AAO \u00d7 4) which stands for Awake, Alert and Oriented to person, place, and time (and circumstances/situation). A more detailed listing of specific findings such as a score obtained for the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE; Folstein et al. 1975) may be found (e.g., 30/30), as well as descriptions of which items the patient failed. This section should include observations regarding attention, language, memory and insight/awareness of any current problems. Notation of defects in orientation, language problems (dysarthria, expressive/receptive aphasia, paraphasias) may be reported here. This section may also report about the patient\u2019s mood and affect along with presence of hallucinations or delusions and risk of harm to self or others. The presence of more specific observations indicates the person was examined in depth, since the designation of \u201cAO \u00d7 3 or AAO \u00d7 3\u201d does not indicate a full or detailed exam was performed.\nCranial nerves\n. These are often summarized as \u201cCN II-XII intact.\u201d Cranial nerve I (olfactory nerve) is generally not tested. As with mental status, it is not always clear when this is a cursory evaluation versus a summation of a detailed examination. See 10.1007/978-0-387-76978-3_3 for review of anatomy of Cranial Nerves, and 10.1007/978-0-387-76978-3_4 for list of the Cranial Nerves and methods for assessment. Neurologists will often group cranial nerves into functional clusters including smell, taste, vision and eye movement, hearing, swallowing, and facial and neck strength and sensation. Sometimes, one will see \u201cCN I\u2013XII were intact (or WNL),\u201d indicating sense of smell was evaluated. However, a more detailed exam will provide clear indication how the CN\u2019s were tested (e.g., \u201ceach nostril tested separately, and pt. able to identify several common scents.\u201d).\n",

Tremor description should indicate where the tremor is present (e.g., upper extremity, lower extremity, head), when it is present (i.e., continuous, under stress, only at rest), and the severity of the tremor (see Fig. 2.3 for \u00adillustration of tremors). A variety of terms may be used to describe when it is present, but the most common will be action tremor (including postural, kinetic, physiological, and intention tremors) or resting tremor (classically, Parkinsonian tremor). Among action tremors, the most common clinically diagnosed type is essential tremor (ET), which is a tremor of 4\u20138 Hz most predominant when a static limb posture is maintained, but may also be evident when moving (intention tremor). Classically, it affects the upper limbs bilaterally, but may present worse in one limb (typically dominant hand). It may also involve the head, termed titubation, with a nodding type of movement. Involvement can include jaw, lips, and larynx, such that the patient\u2019s voice has a quavering quality. It is uncommon for lower extremities to be markedly affected by ET. It can progress to be disabling, making writing illegible and preventing a patient from holding a cup of water to drink (see also 10.1007/978-0-387-76978-3_19, this volume, for further review of ET and other movement disorders). Physiological tremor is present in all normal individuals, and is of high frequency (8\u201313 Hz) and low amplitude such that it is not seen by the naked eye nor appreciated by most people. When exaggerated, termed Enhanced Physiological tremor, by fright, anxiety, extreme exertion, withdraw from alcohol, toxic effects from some chemicals (caffeine, lithium, etc.) or metabolic dysfunction (e.g., hyperthyroidism or hypoglycemia), the physiological tremor increases to be seen and to disrupt routine activities. Enhanced physiological tremor can appear like ET, and is most easily appreciated when holding arms out with fingers outstretched. Intention tremor refers to a tremor distinguished from other action or postural tremor by its form and associated features. Intention tremor is absent at rest and the initial start of a movement. However, as increasingly fine movement is needed for an act (i.e., picking up a full cup of water), the tremor becomes present with a sideways oscillation at about 2\u20134 Hz of increasingly large amplitude that often continues after the target is reached. Intention tremor is always associated with cerebellar ataxia.\n",

These movements can vary from subtle (appearing as \u201crestlessness\u201d to unstable dance-like gait while walking), to more severe (disabling flow of continuous extreme and violent movements). They are frequently associated with basal ganglia diseases. Athetosis describes slow writhing-like movements that are slower than choreiform movements, but may be described as \u201cslow choreiform movements.\u201d Choreoathetosis is an \u201cintermediate\u201d form of choreiform movements. Ballismus describes an extreme of choreiform movement in which motor movements are rapid and include violent flinging movements. It typically involves an involuntary, continuous, uncoordinated movement involving proximal and distal muscle groups resulting in a limb being \u201cflung out.\u201d It typically involves one side of the body, termed hemiballismus, but bilateral paraballismus has been reported.

Dysmetria is abnormal movements associated with cerebellar damage, and involves dysfunction in the ability to accurately control the range of movement needed for a muscular action.

However, return office visits may not re-review all the patient\u2019s history again and note changes in the patient\u2019s history as necessary for the patient\u2019s ongoing care with the treatment provider.
