            "text": "The apolipoprotein D (apo D), a member of the lipocalin superfamily, is a protein with a wide distribution in mammal tissues and an apparently multifunctional role. Apo D is a component of high-density plasma lipoprotein (HDL) in blood plasma that is present in some corporal fluids, like breast cyst fluid, lachrymal secretions, apocrine axillary secretions, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine [1]. In humans, apo D is poorly expressed in the liver and intestines, and is highly expressed in placenta, ovaries, testes, brain, pancreas, and adrenal glands [2]. Apo D may have a local function in peripheral organs, in addition to or in conjunction with a potential role in the circulation [3]. It has been shown that apo D binds several hydrophobic molecules with high affinity for progesterone, pregnenolone, and arachidonic acid (AA), but low for cholesterol [4]. In this way, it has been reported that steroids, such as androgens, estrogens, and glucocorticoids, are very important in the regulation of apo D expression, suggesting that its expression could be directly or indirectly modulated by changes in cellular proliferation [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Furthermore, apo D expression is linked to cellular aging in nervous tissue; apo D is abundant in glial cells of aged individuals and in patients with neuronal cell aging disorders [11], [12]. In normal human fibroblast cell lines, apo D is secreted when cells have reached a senescent stage [10]. Lack of mouse apo D function increases the sensitivity to oxidative stress and the levels of brain lipid peroxidation, and human apo D overexpression in the mouse brain produces opposite effects, increasing survival and preventing the increase in brain lipid peroxides after oxidant treatment [13], [14]. Finally, direct addition of exogenous human apo D to rat hippocampal slice cultures after excitotoxic injury suggests apo D neuroprotective effects by binding to AA and cholesterol, thus preventing oxidation to neurotoxic products, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 7-ketocholesterol [15]. Taken together, these observations suggest that apo D plays a conserved role in response to stress, possibly managing or preventing lipid peroxidation.",

This maternal diabetic environment alters embryonic and feto-placental development, increasing the risk for macrosomia. Hyperglycemia during pregnancy is associated with obesity and diabetes mellitus in adolescence and later life. However, the molecular mechanisms that link GDM and altered fetal growth are not clearly understood. Oxidative stress has recently been implicated in GDM; oxidative stress is defined as a preponderance of pro-oxidative forces over antioxidant defense [16]. The increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been attributed to protein glycation and glucose auto-oxidation in a hyperglycemic environment [17]. To avoid ROS-induced damage of cellular components, several biochemical safety mechanisms are present in the placenta and serum. It has been reported that antioxidant defense is impaired and oxidation reactions are accelerated in placentas of GDM patients; thus, there is an increase in xanthine oxidase (XO), the main free-radical producing enzyme [16]. The principal line of defense against ROS, superoxido-dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and catalase (CAT), are decreased in diabetic animals [18], although the level of SOD in placental tissues of GDM patients was significantly higher [19] or did not significantly change [16]. In addition, other non-enzymatic scavengers, like vitamins E and C, have been shown to be decreased in diabetic pregnancies [18], [20].",

Electrotransfer of proteins from the gel to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotechnology, Barcelona, Spain) was performed for 60 min at 50 V (constant) in a Bio-Rad miniature transfer apparatus (Mini-Protean), as described previously [22]. Non-specific protein binding to the nitrocellulose membranes was reduced by pre-incubating the filter for 2 h at room temperature (RT) in blocking buffer (TNT [100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris\u2013HCl {pH 8}, and 0.2% Tween-20] and 7% BSA) and probe, using a 1:10,000 dilution of polyclonal antibody against human apo D (a gift from Dr. Carlos L\u00f3pez Ot\u00edn, Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica y Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Universidad de Oviedo [23], [24]) or a 1:2,000 dilution of polyclonal antibody against 4-HNE (HNE11-S; Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX, USA), and was carried out overnight at 4 \u00b0C diluted in blocking buffer. The membranes were rinsed several times with blocking buffer without BSA and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate secondary antibody (1:40,000 dilution in TNT) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The membranes were washed again as above and the proteins were detected with the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions using autoluminography on Kodak X-Omat film. All membranes were stripped and probed with a monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (sc1615, dilution 1:2500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) to ensure equal protein loading. To facility integral comparisons during analysis, standards prepared from pooled adult human skeletal muscle protein were used as a positive control and were run in each gel. The specificity of the inmunoreactive proteins was verified by loss of sample immunoreactivity when incubated directly with the secondary antibody. The total value of lipoxidation were determined by densitometry of all bands present in the Western blot for 4-HNE. The bands were quantified using a digital scanner (Nikon AX-110; Nikon, Madrid, Spain) and NIH Image 1.57 software (Scion Corp., MD, USA).",

            "text": "Oxidative stress mechanisms have recently drawn special attention in relation with GDM pregnancy impairment. Lipid peroxidation is considered a harmful event that is difficult to revert and will lead as a chain reaction to the spread of oxidative stress. This process, which often develops during oxidative stress, will lead to the production of the \u201cend products,\u201d malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-HNE. Some studies have reported that both mechanisms (a decrease in antioxidant defenses and an increase free-radical production) are implicated in the pathogenesis of GDM [16]. The levels of MDA and/or HNE therefore represent a measure of the degree of oxidative damage in the tissues. Controversial data have been reported on the oxidative stress status in GDM. In some studies, no difference was found between MDA levels in pregnant women with GDM and healthy pregnant women [29]. Recently, a study has demonstrated an increase in MDA levels and impaired antioxidant defense in the plasma and placental tissues of women with GDM [16]. The Western blot for HNE, a major aldehydic product of lipid peroxidation used as a biomarker of oxidative stress in our study, revealed no differences in levels of HNE in GDM and normal placentas. When immunohistochemistry for HNE was applied, a positive signal was found in all placentas and the cellular location of HNE was similar to previously described by Casasco et al. [30]. This immunohistochemical study showed signal differences between GDM and normal placentas. The HNE signal was present in cytotrophoblast cells, syncytiotrophoblast cells of the villous mesenchyme, and endothelial cells. This intracellular detection, considering the fact that no significant degree of lipid oxidative modification takes place in the plasma, suggests that HNE is a local product of normal placental metabolism [30]. The immunostaining was more intense in the GDM group for HNE. This increase reflects local changes for oxidative stress that were masked when we studied tissue homogenates. These results are in agreement with previous work involving pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia in which immunohistochemical and Western blot data for HNE were conflicting [31].",

In human plasma, apo D and lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) are found on high density lipoprotein particles (HDLs) and have been postulated to form part of a complex involved in the transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion [32]. Then, one possibility to be considered is that apo D might exert in placenta a transport function that controls the supply of lipids across the placental barrier. The expression of apo D by placental cells can be related with some function in transport or regulation of lipid ligands. Apo D shows a strong binding affinity to AA, pregnenolone, progesterone, and bilirubin, while its affinity for estrogens and cholesterol is very low. Apo D binding to progesterone and AA plays a role in cancer development and neurologic diseases [1], [4].",

            "text": "Several data suggest that apo D and its orthologs could play an evolutionarily-conserved role in response to stress, possibly managing or preventing lipid peroxidation [33], [34]. Furthermore, the apo D promoter contains many potential regulatory elements as serum response elements, estrogens, progesterone, and stress response elements [10], [35]. Recent reports have shown that loss of mouse apo D function increases the sensitivity to oxidation stress and the levels of brain lipid peroxidation and human apo D overexpression in the mouse brain produces opposite effects preventing the increase in brain lipid peroxides after oxidant treatment [14]. Apo D also provides resistance against coronavirus [36]. Moreover, recent studies have revealed a neuroprotective effect of apo D against kainite-induced excitotoxicity, and suggest that this effect may be due to the ability of apo D to sequester and reduce the levels of AA and cholesterol oxidation products, F2-isoprostanes and 7-ketocholesterol, respectively. Apo D appears to play a protective role in neuropathologic situations by controlling the level of peroxidated lipids [15], [36], [37], [38], [39].",

Hence, the enhanced expression of apo D in the villous chorion of GDM placentas may indicate an activation of an adaptive placental mechanism to maintenance of oxidative stress status. Since trophoblastic cells and villous macrophages are immunopositives for apo D, it is conceivable that these cells may play a scavenger role protecting the diffusion of lipoperoxidation products from the mother to the embryo. In this sense, enhanced levels of AA and docosahexaenoic acids in the placenta of the GDM women have reported [40].",
