The dynamics may well be understood by modeling causes or carriers of the disease. It is not possible all the time to control the media or carriers involved in spread of the infection and sometimes it may even be beyond determination. Many a time, we may not even recognize the presence of an infection until it becomes predominant. Mathematical modeling is a tool that has been popularly employed in prevention and control of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1], human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) [4], H5N1 (avian flu) [37] and H1N1 (swine flu) [35]. Also, they have been useful in studying some of the drug resistant strains of malaria [12], tuberculosis [5], methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [17] and marine bacteriophage infection [3].",

The susceptible-Infective (SI) model is useful in understanding diseases such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [26] as the host remain infected till they die. The susceptible-infective-susceptible (SIS) model is employed in studying infections such as Gonorrhea [31] as there is a possibility of host becoming susceptible to infection once again. The susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) model is employed to understand diseases such as Syphilis [33], wherein, immunity lasts for a limited period before waning such that the individual is once again susceptible. Dynamics of such systems are generally studied from two perspectives, (i) stability of disease-free equilibrium, and (ii) stability of endemic equilibrium. In the former case conditions under which pathogens suffer extinction leaving individuals as susceptible are studied, whereas in the later, conditions in which infective and susceptible populations coexist are established.",

            "text": "Interactions among populations in compartments such as the susceptible (x) and infected (y) is the key to understand the rate at which the infection can spread in the population. Models with bilinear interaction among populations (xy) tend to disease free equilibrium or endemic equilibrium [7]. Researchers have considered various interactions of non-linear type such as \u03b2xpyq\n[21], [22], [32], [39], [50], xy1+ax\n[53], or xy1+y\n[13], [16], [34], [44], [45], [46], [52] for further understanding dynamics of infectious diseases. It is observed that solutions of periodic nature do exist even without periodic forcing term in the model. The existence of periodic solutions are usually attributed to the presence of time delays in the system even in case of bilinear incidence. Delays do exist in disease transmission, known as the latency period of infection, from inception to an identifiable state. For some interesting studies on infectious disease models, readers are referred to [8], [14], [24], [15], [19], [23], [25], [28], [29], [47], [49], [51]. On the other hand, fluctuations in populations may also be attributed to changes in environment, especially, in open systems. These perturbations are influenced by the environment and may be treated as noise in the system. Dynamic models of competing species under the influence of a noise are extensively studied in [6], [9], [30], [48]. Predictive models based on both clinical, incidence data pertaining to infectious diseases and epidemics in general are discussed in [40], [41], [42].",

The reproduction number represents the number of secondary cases that are caused by a primary case when introduced into a wholly susceptible population. Also, it is observed that if reproduction number is less than unity, the disease free equilibrium is stable, otherwise, the disease prevails [16]. When the nature of interaction is not known or the basic reproduction number is more than unity, one needs to find ways to restrict the disease to a minimum, manageable level, if the disease free environment cannot be provided. When it comes to the control of a disease, vaccination or preventive strategies could be a good choice during the early stages of the disease provided the population is not large enough. Emergence of vaccine resistant strains is one of the drawbacks of frequent or long term vaccination. When massive vaccination is not possible, the second stage of defensive mechanism could be medical treatment. This adds a new sub category of population called recovered class representing the population recovered by treatment.",

Equivalently, if we can show that \u03a8(\u03bd0)>0 then the stability/instability is preserved. Without loss of generality, let \u03bd0 be the smallest positive root of R(F(i\u03bd))=0. Since, n1cos\u03bd(\u03c4+\u03b4)\u2a7d|n1|,l1\u03bdsin\u03bd\u03c4\u2a7d|l1|\u03bd and m1cos\u03bd\u03c4\u2a7d|m1| for any positive \u03bd we have l\u03bd2-n\u2a7d|n1|+|l1|\u03bd+|m1|, from R(F(i\u03bd)).Consider l\u03bd2-|l1|\u03bd-(n+|n1|+|m1|)=0. This has clearly two roots and the bigger one is given by \u03bd+=|l1|+l12+4l(n+|n1|+|m1|)2l. Then clearly \u03bd0\u2a7d\u03bd+. Now from (18), we have \u03a8(\u03bd)>0 is implied if\u03bd6+(l2-2m)\u03bd4+(m2-2ln-l12)\u03bd2+(n2+n12-m12)>2|n-l\u03bd2|+2\u03bd|m-\u03bd2|holds i.e., if(|n-l\u03bd2|-1)2+(\u03bd|m-\u03bd2|-1)2>l12\u03bd02-n12+m12+2holds.The left hand side is positive quantity and the inequality clearly holds if, \u03bd02<n12-(m12+2)l12 holds. Since \u03bd0\u2a7d\u03bd+ this inequality is satisfied provided (19) holds. Thus, \u03a8(\u03bd0)>0, and hence, no change of stability (instability) occurs.Again, from (18), we observe that \u03a8(0)<0 if n2+2n+n12<m12 holds and \u03a8(\u03bd)>0 for large \u03bd and therefore, \u03a8(\u03bd)=0 has a real positive solution. Let \u03bd+ denote smallest such root. Now (18) may be written as(20)Mcos\u03b8+Nsin\u03b8=L,where, M=2(n-l\u03bd2),N=2(m\u03bd-\u03bd3),L=\u03bd6+(l2-2m)\u03bd4+(m2-2ln-l12)\u03bd2+(n2+n12-m12) and \u03b8=\u03c4+\u03b4.

Existence of equilibria and their local stability are studied in detail. An attempt is made to understand the influence of vaccination and treatment on the populations in the presence of time delays in infection, recovery. Results on global stability are also established for a special case of the proposed model. Situations where the effect of time delays on the stability of the equilibria is null and void are identified in this special case. It is important and interesting to further explore this view point for more general cases. In [2] it is observed that the vaccination threshold rate is admissible, beyond which the infection gets eradicated. But 5.1, 5.3 illustrate that vaccination alone cannot eradicate infection but it is the treatment rate that is playing a key role in controlling the disease when the system is influenced by time delays.",

            "text": "The present study raises some basic questions such as,1.In Example 5.3, it is noticed that the equilibrium (2,2,2) is locally stable as long as the time delay in infection \u03c4<4. Thereafter this equilibrium becomes unstable as predicted by the theory (see results in Sections 3, 4). At the same time, simulations show that for \u03c4>4 the system is behaving very wild and large fluctuations are observed in infected and recovered populations. This situation is more vulnerable than having a stable endemic equilibrium where the situation may not be much beyond control. Thus, existence of a stable endemic equilibrium may sometimes be a better choice. Further, the behavior of the system under the simultaneous influence of time delays (general case, Section 3.4) needs to be investigated in detail. For commensurate delays, study in Section 3.4 may provide an estimate but for other types of delays, more explicit estimates are required. However, we need to analyze such situations further.2.Most of the mathematical studies on biological models concentrate on the stability of equilibria (known or identifiable solutions) of the system. Consider the following system.(32)x\u2032=10-3xy-2x+zy\u2032=3x(t-\u03c4)y-5yz\u2032=2y(t-\u03b4)-z.This has both disease free (5,0,0) and endemic (53,209,209) equilibria. But neither Theorem 4.2 nor Theorem 4.1 holds for this case. Also system (29) in Example 5.5 allows no possibility for existence of a disease free equilibrium, and hence, no scope for disease free environment. Comments made in Section 2.1 are aimed at such situations. In such cases, we have to study the ways of controlling the infected populations rather than the stability of the system. This raises the following questions. How to control y? Can we find a small \u220a\u2a7e0 such that y(t)\u2a7d\u220a for some t\u2a7eT. Can we create an inactive state (a \u2018zone of no activation\u2019) for the spreading of the disease? That means can we identify and keep the infected people in a quarantine (at least till vaccination is effective or treatment available is sufficient to meet the requirements)? This would be the point of contention in our future exposition.\n",

System (2) through Examples 5.1 illustrates such cases. Our examples conclude that when the treatment rate is high, a disease-free environment is created (stability of (2,6,6) - Example 5.1 to stability of (5,0,0) - Example 5.2). In the presence of improved vaccination effort alone, the infected and hence, recovered populations are lowered (stability of (2,6,6) - Example 5.1 to stability of (2,2,2) - Example 5.3). Under the influence of better vaccination in addition to high treatment rate, we notice a considerable decrease in susceptible population due to increased rate of infection (stability of (5,0,0) - Example 5.2 to stability of (2.5,0,0) - Example 5.4). It would be interesting to see how far our model explains the dynamics of Chagas disease.",

            "text": "We shall now propose some modifications to (1) taking into consideration some realistic phenomena. We present the following cases as open research problems that would form a part of our further research,1.We have assumed the growth rate of susceptible population a in (1) as a fixed constant. This assumption holds good when the susceptible population receives input from a large society and the disease visits for a limited period during which the reproduction of susceptible, infected and/or recovered population is not significant. However, in case of chronic diseases such as AIDS, Chagas e.t.c., offspring of all three populations may make sizeable contribution to the system. Thus, we may consider,(33)x\u2032=aU(x,y,z)-bf(x,y)-dx-cV(x)+\u03b1zy\u2032=b1fx(t-\u03c4),y(t)-rP(y)-d1yz\u2032=rPy(t-\u03b4)-\u03b1z,here aU(x,y,z) denotes the growth function of susceptible population.2.Vaccination well before an attack by the disease is rare. May be it is possible in a well prepared society? But in most of the cases, vaccine is not readily available and a delay in its preparation or supply is natural. This may be viewed in two directions.(a) Vaccine takes time \u03b3>0 to develop immunity so that susceptible population vaccinated at time t-\u03b3 are immune at time t. Hence, such population may be removed from the system. Thus, we have(34)x\u2032=a-bf(x,y)-dx-cV(t-\u03b3)+\u03b1zy\u2032=b1fx(t-\u03c4),y(t)-rP(y)-d1yz\u2032=rPy(t-\u03b4)-\u03b1z.Notice that we have taken V(x(t))\u2261V(t-\u03b3) in (1) for this case.(b) Vaccination effort being carried out at time t depends on a previous estimation of population. That is, we choose V(x(t))=V(x(t-\u03b7)) in (1). We have(35)x\u2032=a-bf(x,y)-dx-cV(x(t-\u03b7))+\u03b1zy\u2032=b1fx(t-\u03c4),y(t)-rP(y)-d1yz\u2032=rPy(t-\u03b4)-\u03b1z.\n\n3.Recovered population may take time to become susceptible again. That means, they could retain health for some time, say, \u03bc>0. This may be represented in (1) as,(36)x\u2032=a-bf(x,y)-dx-cV(x)+\u03b1z(t-\u03bc)y\u2032=b1fx(t-\u03c4),y(t)-rP(y)-d1yz\u2032=rPy(t-\u03b4)-\u03b1z.\n4.Though mathematical models can describe many plausible realistic phenomena, their usefulness is acceptable only if they stand the test on the real time data. Thus, it would be interesting to test the results of this article with available real time data so that necessary modifications or improvement of (1) may be taken up suitably.5.Consider the influence of sudden environmental changes or other measures taken up to control the spread of disease (may be described as noise in the system). Introducing such term in (1), we have(37)x\u2032=a-bf(x,y)-dx-cV(x)+\u03b1zy\u2032=b1fx(t-\u03c4),y(t)-rP(y)-d1y-\u03b2(t,y)z\u2032=rPy(t-\u03b4)-\u03b1z,here \u03b2(t,y)\u2a7e0 for all t,y may be understood as the rate at which infected population is decreasing owing to changes in environment that are non-conducive for infection or measures taken up to keep the infected away from the system (isolation) or measures taken up by society for controlling the spread of the disease. Of course, a \u03b2(t,y)<0 condition says that the situation is encouraging for growth of infected population.\n",
