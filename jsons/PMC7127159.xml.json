A large amount of dangerous infectious HW, especially plastic syringes and needles, were transferred into society without any treatment. Several accidents have been reported where mishandling of HW wastes led to infections (Shang and Jia, 2002). Furthermore, some plastic appliances were even used as recycled material to produce products such as beverage bottles, disposable cups and food bags (Zhang, 2006), which may pose threats to human health.",

Presently, HW is listed as the number one hazardous waste and, furthermore, several regulations on the collection, transportation and disposal of HW have been established by the State Environmental Protection Administration of China. Meanwhile, the government has provided large amounts of funds to support building large- or medium-scale incineration plants for HW disposal. Currently, incineration has become the major method for HW disposal, and almost every big city owns at least one HW incineration plant. It is estimated that currently there are over 300 incinerators and the number is still increasing (Yan et al., 2003). Nevertheless, there are still small-scale incinerators operating in hospitals in some small cities. These types of incinerators may cause special environmental concern.",

Kuo et al. (1999) has shown that high concentrations of Cr and Ni in HW bottom ash were found because most hospitals in Taiwan do not grind or melt needles and syringes. For comparisons, the concentration of Cr in HW ash was 17 times higher than that typically found in MSW ashes. Meanwhile, high mobility of heavy metals such as Cd, Ni, Pb and Zn in HW ash was also reported since these elements are mainly contained in exchangeable and carbonate forms (Lombardi et al., 1998, Sukandar et al., 2006, Ibanez et al., 2000).",

Table 1\nshows the background information and operating conditions of the incinerators. HWI-I, located in south China, is a special type of medium-scale incinerator, which combined more than ten small fixed grate furnaces. Part or all of the furnaces are operated according to the amount of hospital wastes collected. Although, air pollution control devices (APCDs) are equipped on each furnace, fly ash could not be collected in this type of incinerator; thus only bottom ash was obtained. Two mixed samples (BA1, BA2) were collected every two weeks from the incinerator. HWI-II is a typical small incinerator run by a hospital in a county located in the central part of China (Fig. 1). The incinerator, representing hundreds of incinerators running in China, has no APCDs, thus only bottom ash could be collected. Sampling activities were conducted over three months, and 12 mixed samples (BA3-BA14) were collected once a week. HWI-III, located in northeast China, is a medium-scale incinerator operated in a large city. Incineration ash is mainly collected in the bag filters as fly ash, and the residue mainly consists of unburned glass, plastics and metallic matter. Thus, only fly ash samples were collected from these incinerators. The sampling activities were carried out with for one month, and two homogenized samples (FA1, FA2) were collected. HWI-IV, located in the capital city, Beijing, is a large-scale incinerator with a batch processing capacity of 40 tons per day; the incinerator was properly designed and has well-maintained APCDs. Six samples (FA3-FA8) were collected twice a month. After sampling, all samples were dried at 105 \u00b0C for 24 h and ground to <0.25 mm using an agate mortar for analysis.",

It can be seen from Table 4 that metal concentrations in the ash samples generated from the two types of incinerators are quite different. Specifically, the concentrations of Al, Cu, Fe, Ag, Cr, and Ni in BA1 and BA2 were 2.0\u20132.3, 3.9\u201315.7, 1.9\u201311.0, 1.6\u201310.2, 1.3\u201315, and 5.7\u201346.7 times higher than those in BA3-BA14. This could be explained by the fact that the former incinerator (BA1 and BA2) disposed of HW in a big city, including approximately 200 hospitals; thus the HW disposed in this incineration plant contains higher amounts of metallic objects, such as aluminum cans, scalpels, needles, syringes or small metallic medical tools, than the small hospital-run incineration facility. When these metal wastes are incinerated, the ashes are often enriched with metals. Furthermore, it could also be seen that the concentrations of Bi and Pb in BA1 and BA2 are much lower than in BA3-BA14. The possible reason is that the two metals and their associated compounds generally possess high volatility. Since the former incinerator runs at a higher temperature, more Bi and Pb could have volatilized and could be located in the fly ash.",

As can be seen from Table 5, the concentrations of Ca in FA1 and FA2 are much higher than in FA3-FA8, but Na has the opposite trend. This is because the two incinerators employed different reagents for the removal of acidic gases in the incineration process, i.e., FA1/FA2 used Ca(OH)2 solution while FA3-FA8 used NaOH solutions. Furthermore, it could also be seen from Table 4 that the content of some heavy metals with low thermal mobility such as Ti and Cr could be found enriched in FA1 and FA2, while some high volatilized metals such as Ag, Bi, Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd could be found enriched in FA3-FA8. This could be attributed to the different incineration temperatures performed in the two incinerators, i.e., the FA1/FA2 incinerator performed a lower temperature than FA3-FA8.",

Concentrations of Cd in fly ash samples were about 42\u201362 times higher than those in bottom ash samples (Table 4, Table 5). Some heavy metals, such as Pb, Zn and Cd, either have high volatility or can easily form high volatile compounds (CdCl2, ZnCl2, PbCl2) (Verhulst et al., 1996, Jung et al., 2004, Shim et al., 2005, Sukandar et al., 2006), and thus tend to be transferred into fly ash during the incineration process. Furthermore, it was also reported that As could be completely volatilized when the incineration temperature was above 650 \u00b0C (Verhulst et al., 1996). This could explain the high concentration of As in the fly ash. In contrast, the concentrations of Cr were relatively high in bottom ash samples, which were 3\u201310 times higher than those in fly ash samples. Cr is generally not thermally mobile during the incineration process, and thus mainly remains in the bottom ash (Jung et al., 2004). In the HW ashes, Ag tends to be enriched in fly ash, probably due to the lower boiling points of silver compounds, e.g., the boiling point of silver nitrate is 440 \u00b0C.",

Hospital wastes in China usually contain high amount of plastic matter, while Ba and Zn are usually used as additive in these plastics. For example, PVC used in medical apparatus generally contain these two elements, and this type of plastics also contains high levels of Cl, leading to the high transference rate of Zn into the fly ash because of the formation of ZnCl2 that has a lower boiling point (732 \u00b0C).",

Typically, HW consists of rubber, cotton, syringes, needles, scalpels, metal cans, plastics, glass, and small metallic medical tools, while MSW is generally composed of food scraps, plastics, paper, yard wastes, and minor amounts of household construction materials. Thus the ashes from incineration of the two waste types will be quite different. Table 6 shows that both HW bottom ash and fly ash contain higher amounts of Ag, As, Bi, Ti, and Zn than MSW ashes. Furthermore, HW fly ash contains higher amounts of Cd, Cu, Pb than MSW fly ash, and HW bottom ash contains higher amounts of Cr than MSW bottom ash. In the medical field, these heavy metals are generally used in medicines, photographic materials, and medical tools. Therefore, they are present in the HW waste stream, causing their high concentrations in the resulting incineration ashes. Compounds of As and Ag are usually used in some medicines, and silver nitrate is used as a sensitive material of X-ray plates. Bi is usually added to a sponge for use in surgery or for dressing wounds (Jung et al., 2004). Bi is also used in alloys with Pb, Sn and Cd in the production of small medical tools. High concentrations of Cr may come from infectious wastes such as needles and syringes (Kuo et al., 1999). In addition, high concentrations of Cr were found in plastic wastes from a hospital (Shim et al., 2005). Ti is widely used in medical instruments and implants as a special alloy metal (e.g., substitute for bone). The large amount of Zn in HW ashes may come from a variety of sources. For example, waste plastics and rubber from hospitals are relatively abundant with Zn (Kuo et al., 1999). Also, Zn is widely used in medical adhesive plaster, as well as in the alloys for needle and syringe production (Kuo et al., 1999).",
