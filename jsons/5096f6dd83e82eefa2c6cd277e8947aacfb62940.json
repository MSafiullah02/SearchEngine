Elimination of CRS syndrome should be one of the primary goals of a program for prevention of vaccine-preventable disease in developed and developing countries. Adoption of MMR and the two-dose policy will gradually lead to eradication of rubella and rubella syndrome. Viral Hepatitis. Viral hepatitis is a group of diseases of increasing public health importance due to their large scale worldwide prevalence, their serious consequences, and our increasing ability to take preventive action. Viral hepatic infectious diseases each have specific etiologic, clinical, epidemiologic, serologic, and pathologic characteristics. They have important short-and long-term sequelae. Vaccine development is of high priority for control and ultimate eradication. HEPATITIS A. Hepatitis A (HAV) was previously known as infectious hepatitis or epidemic jaundice. HAV is mainly transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Clinical severity varies from a mild illness of 1-2 weeks to a debilitating illness lasting several months. The norm is complete recovery within 9 weeks, but a fulminating or even fatal hepatitis can occur. Severity of the disease worsens with increasing age. HAV is sporadic/endemic worldwide. Improving sanitation raises the age of exposure, with accompanying complications. It now occurs particularly in persons from industrialized countries when exposed to situations of poor hygiene, or among young adults when traveling to areas where the disease is en-demic. Common source outbreaks occur in school-aged children and young adults from case contact, or from food contaminated by infected handlers. Hepatitis A may be a serious public health problem in a disaster situation.",

It was the fear of recurrence of this pandemic which led the CDC to launch a massive immunization program in the United States in 1976 to prevent swine flu (the virus was a strain antigenically similar to that of the 1918 pandemic influenza) from spreading from an isolated outbreak in an army camp. The effort was stopped after millions of persons were immunized with an urgently produced vaccine when serious reactions occurred (Guillain-Barre Syndrome, (i.e., a type of paralysis), and when no further cases of swine flu were seen. This demonstrated the difficulty of extrapolating scenarios from a historical experience. Each year, epidemiologic services of the WHO and collaborating centers such as the CDC recommend which strains should be used in vaccine preparation for use among susceptible population groups. These vaccines are prepared with the current anticipated epidemic strains. The three main types of influenza (A, B, and C) have different epidemiological characteristics.

It induces tuberculin sensitivity or an antigen-antibody reaction in which antibodies produced may be somewhat protective against the tubercle bacillus in 90% of vaccinees. Although the support for its general use is contradictory, there is evidence from case-control and contact studies of positive protection against TB meningitis and disseminated TB in children under the age of 5. In some developed, low-incidence countries, it is not used routinely but selectively. It may also be used in asymptomatic HIV-positive persons or other high risk groups. The BCG vaccine for tuberculosis remains controversial. While used widely internationally, in the United States and other industrialized countries, it is thought to hinder rather than help in the fight against TB. This concern is based on the usefulness of tuberculin testing for diagnosis of the disease. Where BCG has been administered, the diagnostic value of tuberculin testing is reduced, especially in the period soon after the BCG is used. Studies showing equivocal benefit of BCG in preventing tuberculosis have added to the controversy. While those in the field in the United States continue to oppose the use of BCG, internationally it is still felt to be of benefit in preventing TB, primarily in children.",

Several U.S. manufacturers produced vaccines which are approved for animal and human use.

She mapped each of the six arthritis cases in the town, cases which had occurred in a short time span among boys living in close proximity. This suggested that this syndrome of \"juvenile rheumatoid arthritis\" was perhaps connected with the boys playing in the woods. She presented her data to the head of Rheumatology at Yale Medical School in New Haven, who investigated this \"cluster of a new disease entity.\" Some parents reported that their sons had experienced tick bites and a rash before onset of the arthritis.

The nematode causes a burning blister on the skin when it is ready to release its eggs. After the blister ruptures, the worm discharges larvae whenever the extremity is in water. The eggs are ingested in contaminated water and the larva released migrate through the viscera to locate as adults in the subcutaneous tissue of the leg. Incubation is about 12 months. The larva released in water are ingested by minute crustaceans and remain infective for as long as a month.",

With increases in longevity and increased importance of chronic disease in the health status of the industrial and mid-level developing nations, the effects of infectious disease on the care of the elderly and chronically ill is of great importance in the New Public Health. Long-term management of chronic disease needs to address the care of vulnerable groups, promoting the use of existing vaccines and antibiotics. Most important is the development of health systems that provide close monitoring of groups at special risk for infectious disease, especially patients with chronic diseases, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. The combination of traditional public health with direct medical care needed for effective control and eradication of communicable diseases is an essential element of the New Public Health. The challenge is to apply a comprehensive approach and management of resources to define and reach achievable targets in communicable disease control.",
