As of July 11, 2003, the number of reported probable cases was 8437, with 813 deaths (1). A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was promptly implicated as the causative agent (2)(3)(4). Macaques infected with SARS-CoV subsequently developed respiratory symptoms and pathology similar to SARS patients, thus fulfilling the Koch postulates (5). Efforts in sequencing the viral genome promptly followed, and the genomic sequence revealed little homology to previously characterized strains of coronaviruses (6)(7). The complete genomic sequences of several SARS-CoV isolates have since been made publicly available (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).",

Ruan et al.

Isolates that demonstrated the C:G:C:C haplotype were epidemiologically traceable to the early part of the epidemic (9). On the other hand, SARS was first reported in Hong Kong when a cluster of cases was noted among visitors to the Metropole Hotel. This case cluster comprised international travelers who subsequently brought SARS to other countries, including Vietnam, Canada, and Singapore (11). Epidemiologic investigations revealed that the cases were traceable to a nephrologist from Guangdong Province, China, who checked into the hotel on February 21, 2003 (8)(11). These data suggest that since the emergence of SARS-CoV in southern China, at least two strains of the virus had emerged (9).",

This patient, designated A, presented to a hospital in Hong Kong on February 17, 2003, with a 2-day history of fever, chills, rigors, dry cough, and intense malaise. She resided in the US, but before symptom onset, she had been visiting her ailing mother in Guangzhou, China. Her mother died on February 12, 2003, of a cause unknown to the family. After admission, patient A deteriorated rapidly and required intensive care. Her chest radiograph revealed patchy infiltration, and serologic testing subsequently showed markedly increased antibody titers against SARS-CoV. Four household members and two healthcare workers later developed fever and respiratory symptoms.",

Because polymorphisms seen in a single isolate could potentially be a result of culture or sequencing artifacts, we selected the target sites based on polymorphisms that were shared by at least two SARS-CoV isolates published in GenBank at the time of this study. The product was then amplified with use of 14 pairs of forward (PCR-F) and reverse (PCR-R) primers in a cDNA polymerase mixture (BD Clontech), with initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 1 min and 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 0.5 min, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 0.5 min, and extension at 68 \u00b0C for 1.5 min, and a final extension at 68 \u00b0C for 10 min. Seminested PCR was performed with the PCR-F and BSEQ-R series of primers with the same thermal profile. Primer sequences are available in the Data Supplement accompanying the online version of this Technical Brief athttp://www.clinchem.org/content/vol50/issue1/ .

However, at present, it is uncertain whether these cumulative changes contributed to the infectivity and propagation efficiency of the SARS-CoV and, thus, the development of the SARS epidemic. It remains to be seen whether this evolutionary transition of the SARS-CoV may have implications on a possible future reemergence of SARS.",
