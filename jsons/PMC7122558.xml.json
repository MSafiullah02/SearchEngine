Epidemics, emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases are outcomes of these changes, and they constitute serious global threats for health. Although some local emergences have a potential for global threat (i.e. SARS, avian influenza, etc.), most of infectious diseases affect rural and poor populations particularly in developing countries, which are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of global change. Southeast Asia is both a hotspot of infectious emerging diseases of potential global pandemics and of biodiversity, particularly at threat due to dramatic changes in land use (Morand et al. 2014). These may explain why international organizations, developmental agencies and non-governmental conservationist organizations have specially focused on Southeast Asia. Infectious diseases are still a major concern in most Southeast-Asian countries (Coker et al. 2011).",

As Dominique Buchillet emphasizes along with famine due to crop failures and other calamities, epidemics exerted a heavy burden on Chinese populations throughout the ages. The chapter reviews the evolution of medical perceptions on epidemic diseases through these Chinese classics, stressing the importance of the growing awareness of variations in environments and the refashioning of discourses and practices relative to epidemic diseases in Chinese medicine.",

They study the transfer of the TME between the different compartments in and downstream of the reservoir. In particular, they show that upstream areas contributed to bring TME in the Mae Thang Reservoir and that TME concentrations in fishes were thus affected and should be controlled. Finally, they conclude that accumulation of TME in soils of paddy field due to the use of pesticides and fertilizer may increase contamination of rice in the long term.",

They emphasize on the use of landscape analysis as a tool in vector control strategy development and show that an increase in landscape diversity, particularly forest fragmentation, reduces malaria vector diversity and density.

They observed that in both rubber plantations and forests, Aedes albopictus was the most frequent mosquito. The use of geometric morphometrics tools allowed to distinguish the populations, potentially invasive, in rubber plantations from the ones, potentially native, in fragmented forests. Rubber plantations (RP) in Asia represent millions of artificial breeding sites for dangerous mosquitoes: they could be responsible for the drastic increase and recent planetary importance of Aedes albopictus populations.",
