            "text": "In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government decided to implement a lockdown of the population, reducing ENT activities to emergency treatments and those that could not be deferred without constituting a real loss of chance for the patient's recovery or survival (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/guide-covid-19-phase-epidemique-v15-16032020.pdf. 16 March 2020). Practical sheets for patients (Fig. 1\n) and practitioners (Fig. 2\n) were drawn up jointly by the French ENT Society (SFORL), the French ENT National Union, the French ENT College, and the French National Professional ENT Council to guide the choice between calling the French emergency services (dialling 15), teleconsultation, face-to-face consultation, and postponing the consultation. To allow the population to visit ENT practices confidently and avoid postponing urgent treatments, enhanced protective measures were laid out by the Health Ministry in conjunction with the French Public Health Council and the French Society for Hospital Hygiene. These were circulated in town-based practices and in regional healthcare facilities by the network of Support Centres for the Prevention of Healthcare-associated Infections. As the independent and apolitical French organization called Institut de Sant\u00e9 (\u201cHealth Institute\u201d) points out, some treatments of ENT diseases that could have been deferred by a few weeks are now becoming urgent at the risk of constituting a real loss of chance for the patient's recovery or survival (https://www.institut-sante.org/covid19-plan-de-sortie-de-crise-de-linstitut-sante/). The protective measures applied during the lockdown period will be maintained once the lockdown is over to allow the resumption of treatments and to prevent their cessation and delay. ENT specialists in private practices and in hospitals have a proactive role to play for their patients (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/organisation_soins-hospitaliers_covid-19.pdf). The best practice recommendations for ENT consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic have been drawn up because ENT examinations and treatments risk the practitioner being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 contamination in certain instances [1]. Thus, ENT specialists are among the professionals who are most exposed to COVID-19.",

This website is intended to inform them of what they should do in the event that they have symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (Box 1\n). The face-to-face ENT consultation appointment must be postponed if the patient shows the symptoms on the Maladie Coronavirus website. In this case, the patient must contact their attending physician or the emergency services. Emergency treatment can justify referring the patient to an ENT clinic suitable for the care of COVID positive patients. The patient is advised to go to the ENT consultation alone and at the exact time of the appointment. For specific circumstances (children, dependent people, etc.), it is advised that only one person accompany them. They are advised to bring their own pen and to pay for the consultation by card. On arriving at the ENT practice, they will be asked to rub their hands with a virucidal hydro-alcoholic solution (HAS) corresponding to the European norm 14476 or to wash their hands with soft soap followed by drying their hands with single-use hand towels. Depending on the decision of the consultant or the facility, the decision may also be taken to have each patient wear a surgical mask, or only the most vulnerable ones.Box 1Symptoms informing the patient population about the Coronavirus Disease, from the Maladie Coronavirus website (https://maladiecoronavirus.fr, co-developed by the Institut Pasteur and the Assistance publique\u2013H\u00f4pitaux de Paris).\n\u2022Your temperature is high in the last 48 h\u2022You have a cough, or your usual cough has gotten worse in the last few days\u2022You have noticed a large decrease or loss in your sense of taste or smell in the last few days\u2022You have had a sore throat and/or muscle pains and/or unusual aches in the last few days\u2022You have had diarrhoea, with at least three loose stools, in the last 24 h\u2022You have been unusually tired in the last few days\u2022You have been unable to eat or drink in the last 24 hor more\u2022You have noticed an unusual shortness of breath when you talk or when you lightly exert yourself in the last 24 h\n",

As per the recommendations of the French Society for Hospital Hygiene, the usual measures for bio-cleaning health care premises are effective for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, once the products used are adapted (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/consignes-hygiene-cabinets-ville-covid19.pdf; https://www.sf2h.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Avis-SF2H-05-avril-2020-D\u00e9sinfection-scanner-et-autres-appareils-dimagerie.pdf). Human coronaviruses can be effectively inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with solutions containing 62\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite with a minimum contact time of 1 min. By analogy with other enveloped viruses, disinfectant cleaners meeting European virucidal standard EN 14476 for enveloped viruses (Vaccinia test strain) would inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.sf2h.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Avis-SF2H-05-avril-2020-D\u00e9sinfection-scanner-et-autres-appareils-dimagerie.pdf). In practice, it is recommended to clean frequently touched surfaces with 14476-standard virucidal disinfectant cleaning wipes at least twice a day, paying particular attention to surfaces in direct contact with patients (door handles, furniture, toilet flush, sink, etc.), to ventilate the premises extensively and regularly, and to schedule a complete bio-cleaning once a day (preferably in the evening).",

During ENT examinations or procedures without exposure to projection/aerosolization of organic material of human origin (PAOM) (Table 1\n), the ENT medical team wear clean outfits as well as single-use gloves in case of contact with a mucosa (Table 2\n). For examinations and procedures with exposure to PAOM (Table 1), protection must be supplemented by wearing a surgical mask, protective goggles (glasses do not ensure this protection), a single-use plastic apron, and single-use gloves (Table 2). For patients who are known carriers of or infected by certain pathogens, protection can be supplemented in three different ways according to the type of infectious agents. As part of \u201ccontact\u201d precautions, wearing a single-use plastic apron (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Extended spectrum \u03b2-Lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus faecalis of intermediate sensitivity or resistant to vancomycin, cutaneous staphylococci and streptococci, herpes, hepatitis A and E, Rotavirus, etc.) or a long-sleeved overgown (scabies, Clostridium difficile infection, acute gastroenteritis) is recommended.

An FFP2/N95 RPD and protective goggles are also recommended for pathogens requiring \u201cairborne\u201d precautions (measles, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus MERSCoV, pulmonary tuberculosis, chicken pox, tuberculoid leprosy, avian flu, etc.).",

            "text": "Insofar as an asymptomatic patient may be infectious, the same precautions must be employed whether the patient is ill with, suspected of having, or without any clinical evidence of COVID-19 infection. The professional's choice of PPE depends on the type of examination or procedure carried out during ENT consultation and its propensity to generate PAOM (https://www.inspq.qc.ca/sites/default/files/covid/2905-evaluation-risque-exposition-ts-lors-de-soins-covid19.pdf). According to the scientific data available, particularly on exposure to SARS-CoV-2 while breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing, and despite the absence of specific studies on aerosol generation or micro-organism transmission while conducting ENT procedures, the examinations and procedures potentially at risk of transmitting infectious aerosols are listed in Table 1 (https://www.inspq.qc.ca/sites/default/files/covid/chuq-imga-covid.pdf) [2]. For ENT examinations and treatments without PAOM, the professional wears a long sleeve outfit, a surgical mask, and gloves in case of contact with a mucosa (Table 2). For ENT treatments with exposure to PAOM, their conduct requires additional precautions taking contact, droplets and airborne into account (Table 2). These additional measures deal with the type of mask to use (surgical mask or FFP2/N95 RPD), eye protection, and the standard gown (long sleeves). It is possible to extend the use of the FFP2/N95 RPD for several patient consultations when their supply is low, during which period the allocation set out by the national crisis unit changes weekly (https://www.sf2h.net/avis-du-14-mars-2020-prolongation-utilisation-des-masques; https://dgs-urgent.sante.gouv.fr/dgsurgent/inter/detailsMessageBuilder.do?id=30751&cmd=visualiserMessage). It is thus possible to do one 4-hour shift with an FFP2/N95 RPD. Disposable overgowns and hair caps will be changed between each patient and immediately in the case of soiling (through sprays of blood, saliva, aerosolization, etc.). So as not to have to change the overgown, it is possible to protect it with a single-use plastic apron, and to change the apron between two patients.",

Surgical activity has been reorganised [3]. After the end of the lockdown, the provision of ENT treatment is resuming in town-based practices and hospitals with the objective of avoiding any delayed diagnosis and any loss of chance for the patient's recovery or survival (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/organisation_soins-hospitaliers_covid-19.pdf). It is recommended that ENT specialists actively contact patients and parents of children with chronic pathologies whose consultations have been postponed in order to encourage them to attend an ENT consultation. This resumption of ENT diagnostic, screening, and consultation activities must be organized within the framework of a coordinated action between private structures, public hospitals, medical analysis laboratories and radiology centres, and must continue to rely in part on teleconsultation (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/organisation_soins-hospitaliers_covid-19.pdf). Considering the significant risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during their conduct, these high-risk ENT examinations and procedures will be limited to those, which are absolutely necessary for a COVID-19 patient. They may be postponed to when the patient is no longer contagious. As far as possible, the ENT specialist will attempt to plan these high-risk procedures in advance to avoid having to carry them out in an emergency situation. Confinement entailed a risk of disorganized screening, surveillance and monitoring of ENT cancers. Regarding neonatal screening for deafness, its disorganisation is linked to very short stays in maternity hospitals, which compromises the thoroughness of retesting. The resumption of ENT activity in centres specialising in paediatric audiology must avoid any loss of chance for the patient.",

This sheath should be removed immediately after use and eliminated in the Infectious Medical Waste (IMW) system (https://www.hcsp.fr/Explore.cgi/avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=21). The endoscope should be disinfected as per the standard procedure as the virus is susceptible to the disinfectant products usually used: careful wiping of the nasal endoscope with a wet (or pre-soaked) single-use 14476-standard virucidal disinfectant-cleaning wipe (https://www.hcsp.fr/Explore.cgi/avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=21). The disinfection is conducted along the whole length of the scope, including the proximal sections that have not been in direct contact with the patient's nasal cavities. The use of a fiberscope camera is advised to allow for distancing between the patient and the ENT physician. After the endoscopy, the surfaces located near where the endoscopy was carried out (tables, floor, etc.) must be cleaned with a virucidal disinfectant detergent EN 14476 to remove any contaminating projections. If a sheath was not used, the disinfection of the device must comply with the best practice rules laying down the standard procedures for treating thermosensitive endoscopes without an operating channel using bactericidal and virucidal products (https://www.hcsp.fr/Explore.cgi/avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=21). After the examination, the professional must carefully disrobe in compliance with hygiene rules, with the immediate elimination of gloves, mask, hair cap, and overgown in the IMW system for treatments in healthcare facilities, or as per the system for non-infected medical waste for doctors\u2019 offices (domestic waste stream, double-bagged with 24 hours\u2019 storage before elimination) (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/guide-covid-19-phase-epidemique-v15-16032020.pdf). The room where the examination is carried out must undergo air renewal as per the legislation. The room should have additional aeration or a rest period depending on the flow of ventilation.",

ENT teleconsultation allows physicians to continue taking care of patients who cannot travel and makes it possible to ensure continuity of care while limiting the preventable risks of spreading the coronavirus within ENT private practices and healthcare facilities (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/covid-19_teleconsultation-fiche-medecin.pdf; https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/soins-et-maladies/maladies/maladies-infectieuses/coronavirus/professionnels-de-sante/article/teleconsultation-et-covid-19-qui-peut-pratiquer-a-distance-et-comment). It also allows the ENT specialist to select patients who can be counselled or treated without the need for a face-to-face consultation (leaving the possibility of a follow-up telephone callback) and those who must be received at the doctor's office. This teleconsultation may include an interview, an inspection of the head and neck region, a self-palpation of the patient, the commented reading of results of biological tests or radiological reports, and the renewal or adaptation of treatments already prescribed. This remote consulting arrangement was made available to all patients and all ENT specialists with 100% coverage by the French social security system. Communication without video is accepted for the following patients: those aged 70 or over, those being monitored for a long-term health condition, those living in areas with no signal, and those ill with or suspected of having COVID-19. This new organisation in the field of healthcare is not adapted to all situations. Wherever the ENT specialist deems it necessary, they may interrupt the teleconsultation and suggest a physical consultation.",

Medical tele-audiology can be seen as a three-level scale. The first level involves self-screening tests (tone audiometry or vocal audiometry test in noise), the result of which may or may not lead to advising consultation with a physician. It is important that the self-administered test be carried out in a quiet environment. The second level involves the caregiver managing the patient in their everyday life. Finally, the third level allows the ENT specialist to interact directly with the patient to carry out tone audiometry with masking of the non-test ear, vocal audiometry using lists of words, phonemes, or validated pseudo-words in French, or even vocal audiometry in noise. The tele-audiometry data must be stored on a server labelled HDS (Healthcare Data Hosting).",
