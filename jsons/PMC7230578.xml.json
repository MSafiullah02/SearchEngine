Coronaviruses are well known for their ability to mutate rapidly, alter tissue tropism, cross the species barrier, and adapt to different epidemiological situations [1]. Six human coronaviruses have been reported since the 1960s; four of them (OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1) cause mild illness similar to the common cold and gastrointestinal tract infection. The other two, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have raised significant public health concerns due to their zoonotic emergence and crossing of the species barrier, causing high pathogenicity and mortality in humans [2]. SARS- and MERS-CoVs were reported to be transmitted from the main host (bats) to palm civets or dromedary camels, respectively, then finally to humans [3,4,5]. Both SARS- and MERS-CoVs were and are highly pathogenic, resulting in 8096 and 2519 human cases, with 9.6% and 34.3% fatality rate in 2003\u20132004 and 2012\u2013present, respectively [6,7].",

Based on phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 forms a distinct lineage with Bat-SARS-like coronaviruses that belong to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, and subgenus Sarbecovirus [9]. SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.3%, 89%, and 82% nucleotide similarity with bat CoV RaTG13, SARS-like CoV ZXC21, and SARS-CoV, respectively, which confirms its zoonotic origin [10,11].",

Despite the differences in S protein sequences, all 11 SARS-like CoVs are still able to use the same human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) receptor, demonstrating a close relationship with SARS-CoV. Therefore, SARS-CoV likely emerged through recombination of bat SARS-like CoVs before infecting civets, from which the recombinant virus spread to humans, causing the SARS epidemic [5,26].",

The human and camel MERS-CoV strains share more than 99% identity with variations (substitutions) located in the S, ORF3, and ORF4b genes [28]. Phylogenetically, MERS-CoV is very close to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 [29]. A comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary relationships indicated that MERS-CoV may have originated from bats as a result of recombination events within ORF1ab and S genes [30,31]. To gain access into the cell, MERS-CoV uses the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor [32]. This is also the case for MERS-related CoVs isolated from bats in China, whose spike proteins are able to bind to the same receptor as MERS-CoV, confirming the possibility of a bat origin for MERS-CoV [33].

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are one of the largest groups of viruses that belong to the order Nidovirales, suborder Cornidovirineae, and family Coronaviridae. Coronaviridae is classified into two subfamilies, namely, Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae. Letovirinae includes the Alphaletovirus genus, while Orthocoronaviridae is further classified on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and genome structure into four genera: Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV), Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3CoV), and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4CoV), which contain 17, 12, 2, and 7 unique species, respectively (ICTV 2018). The most recent classification of the Coronaviridae is shown in Table 1. Corona in Latin means crown, and this name was attributed to the virus due to the presence of spike projections from the virus envelope that give it the shape of a crown under the electron microscope; Nido means nest and refers to the ability of the viruses of this order to make a nested set of subgenomic mRNA [25,35].",

The analysis of the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed similar binding affinities [60]. Wu et al. [2] found a total of 27 amino acid substitutions in the S protein but not in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly interacts with hACE2, which may affect host tropism. These 27 substituted residues were distributed as follows: 17 in the S1 subunit [6 in the RBD and 6 in the subdomain (SD)] and 10 in the S2 subunit. Wan et al. [58] reported similarity in the spike protein RBD, including RBM, of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, in addition to the presence of several residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBM that favor the interaction with human ACE2. These results agree with the genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, according to which the S2 subunit of the spike protein shares 99% identity with those of two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVZXC21 and ZC45) and of human SARS-CoV [13]. While the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit was conserved, the S1 subunit shares an overall 70% identity with those of bat and human SARS-CoV. The RBD core domain of S1 is highly conserved, with most of the amino acid differences located in the external subdomain that is responsible for the direct interaction with host receptors [13]. Investigators have also reported the presence of a polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Differences in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the high contagious nature of this virus suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved via natural selection for binding to human ACE2 receptor [61].",

For example, SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civets to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Bats are currently considered a reservoir for all human coronaviruses, as mentioned above [5,71]. Many coronaviruses are circulating in animals but have not yet infected humans. The type of animal that SARS-CoV-2 originated from is still unclear. At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, many patients were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. After retrospectively studying case reports, the number of patients that did not have exposure to animal markets has risen, indicating person-to-person spread was also occurring at that time [66]. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to bat coronaviruses and SARS-CoV [8]. A group of researchers reported early in the outbreak that the novel SARS-CoV-2 has the highest similarity of codon usage bias with snakes [72,73]; however, this method to determine initial host origins is dubious. Interestingly, researchers also reported one amino acid difference in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of Pangolin-CoV compared to that of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins might play a role as an intermediate host (Xiao et al., data currently under review). Another group of researchers reported that the virus originated from bats based on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, which is 96% identical to bat coronavirus RaTG13. There were speculations that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory-engineered CoV and leaked directly from a laboratory in Wuhan where a bat CoV (RaTG13) was recently reported. However, there is no evidence to support this allegation [74]. Recently, a group of researchers found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks but efficiently in ferrets and cats [75]. Scientists are still trying to find the main source of the disease outbreak and identify the definitive intermediate hosts.",

These droplets can be inhaled to reach the lung. The virus can be indirectly transmitted via touching a surface or an object that was previously contaminated with the virus and then touching the face, eyes, or mouth [76] and possibly via the fecal\u2013oral route [77,78]. Asymptomatic carriers (during the incubation period of the virus) and patients after recovery from the acute form of the disease are also considered a potential source of virus transmission to healthy persons [10,12].

High temperature (\u226530 \u00b0C) can reduce the persistence period, while low temperature (4 \u00b0C) increases the persistence time up to 28 days [79]. Transmission of the virus vertically from mother to fetus or via breast milk has not been confirmed yet [80]. The transmission cycle of coronavirus among animals and humans is shown in Figure 3.",

Using artificial intelligence models in the future may be useful in mass screening, to allow risk prioritization and help to minimize turnaround time [90]. Pan et al. [91] conducted a retrospective study to elaborate the time course of lung changes during recovery from infection. They described findings using international standard nomenclatures such as ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and crazy paving patterns. They established a semi-quantitative scoring system of 5 grades to quantify the degree of involvement based on an area ranging from 0% to >75%. The total score ranged from 0 to 25 (max), and involvement was subpleural, random, or diffuse. They found that in early stages (0\u20134 days after the onset of symptoms), GGO was the main finding in lower lung lobes; in progressive stages (5\u20138 days), the progression of lung disease involved three patterns of ground-glass, consolidation, and crazy paving, while in peak stages (9\u201313 days), dense consolidation became the prevalent feature; in absorption stages (>14 days), GGO was detected with no crazy paving and resolution of consolidations [91]. More than 75% of SARS-CoV-2-affected patients suffered from bilateral lung involvement, and 71% have multilobe involvement. CT examinations of 21 patients showed 29% consolidation and 86% GGO in the chest [8,9,92,93]. Another study examined 51 cases by CT and reported that 77% showed pure GGO, 75% exhibited GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickness, 59% had GGO with consolidation, while 55% revealed pure consolidation. Bilateral lung involvement was reported in 86% of cases; in 80% of the cases the posterior part of the lung was involved, while in 86%, the periphery was involved [94].",

Some drug combinations that could be successful for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients are lopinavir and ritonavir [97,98], lopinavir/ritonavir plus arbidol [99], and ribavirin and interferon [100,101]. The use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, janus kinase inhibitors (JAK), and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine in SARS-CoV-2 patients is a dilemma, especially in patients suffering from an impaired immune system. Balancing the risk\u2013benefit ratio is a critical issue. Corticosteroids may delay the elimination of the virus and increase the risk of secondary infection. In addition, drugs targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit specific inflammatory factors and thus may not be very effective in curbing the cytokine storm (excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines). Moreover, some anti-inflammatory drugs such as JAK block INF-\u03b1 production, which is important in fighting the virus [102]. ",

The virus has the potential for rapid and extensive spread between people and countries. There are a lot of misleading information and knowledge gaps on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reviewed the latest updates about different aspects including epidemiology, source of infection, transmission dynamics, zoonotic potential, virus characteristics, and discovery of novel strategies for disease control to avoid spillover of infection in the future. Bats play an important role in the transmission of the infection to humans. Coronaviruses are genetically diverse and have a high tendency towards frequent genetic mutations and gene recombination, which increases the risk of interspecies transmission. Information about the incubation period can help in establishing an effective quarantine for asymptomatic carriers, thus preventing the virus spread. From our perspectives and based on the currently available information about the virus and its epidemiology, the control of the SARS-CoV-2 requires an effective and global disease coordination effort including multidisciplinary research efforts (One-Health approach) through collaboration between governments, epidemiologists, virologists, health authorities, veterinarians, and physicians. At this stage of the disease outbreak, developing vaccines is crucial to limit the spread of the infection. ",
