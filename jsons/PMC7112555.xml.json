The N nodes in\nthe network are numbered as i=1,2,\u2026,N,\nand a directed edge with weight M, extending from node\nj to node i, is\nrepresented as W(i,j)=M.\nNo self-connections (loops) are considered. The in and out\nstrengths of a node i, abbreviated as\nis(i)\nand os(i),\ncorrespond to the sum of the weights of its in- and outbound connections, respectively. The\nstochastic matrix S for such a network isS(i,j)=W(i,j)\u2215os(j).(1)The\nmatrix S is assumed to be irreducible; i.e., any of\nits nodes can be accessible from any other node, which allows the definition of a unique and\nstable steady state. An agent, placed at any initial node j, chooses\namong the adjacent outbound edges of node j with probability equal to\nS(i,j).\nThis step is repeated a large number of times T, and the frequency of\nvisits to each node i is calculated as\nv(i)=(numberofvisitsduringthewalk)\u2215T.\nIn the steady state (i.e., after a long time period T),\nv=Sv and the frequency\nof visits to each node along the random walk may be calculated in terms of the eigenvector\nassociated with the unit eigenvalue (e.g., Ref. 6). For\nproper statistical normalization we set \u2211pv(p)=1.\nThe dominant eigenvector of the stochastic matrix has theoretically and experimentally been\nverified to be remarkably similar to the corresponding eigenvector of the weight matrix,\nimplying that the adopted random walk model shares several features with other types of\ndynamics, including linear and nonlinear summations of activations and flow in networks.",

More specifically, as time progresses, the frequency of visits to each\nnetwork node approaches the activity values which would be obtained by the traditional\ndiffusion equation. A full congruence between such frequencies and activity diffusion is\nobtained at the equilibrium state of the random walk process. Therefore, random walks are also\ndirectly related to the important phenomenon of diffusion, which plays an important role in a\nlarge number of linear and nonlinear dynamic systems including disease spreading and pattern\nformation. Random walks are also intrinsically connected to Markov chains, electrical\ncircuits, and flows in networks, and even dynamical models such as Ising. For such reasons,\nrandom walks have become one of the most important and general models of dynamics in physics\nand other areas, constituting a primary choice for investigating dynamics in complex\nnetworks.",

The\nproof of the statement above is as follows. Because the network is strongly connected, its\nstochastic matrix S has a unit eigenvector in the steady\nstate, i.e., v=Sv. Since\nS(i,j)=W(i,j)\u2215os(j),\nthe ith\nelement of the vector Sos is given asS(i,1)os(1)+S(i,2)os(2)+\u22ef+S(i,N)os(N)=W(i,1)os(1)os(1)+W(i,2)os(2)os(2)+\u22ef+W(i,N)os(N)os(N)=W(i,1)+W(i,2)+\u22ef+W(i,N)=is(i).(2)By\nhypothesis, is(i)=os(i)\nfor any i and, therefore, both\nos and is are\neigenvectors of S associated with the unit eigenvalue.\nThen os=is=v, implying full correlation between\nfrequency of visits and both in and out strengths.",

Therefore, an out strength scale-free3 network must produce sequences obeying Zipf\u2019s law7 and vice versa. If, on the other hand, the node\ndistribution is Gaussian, the frequency of visits to nodes will also be a Gaussian function;\nthat is to say, the distribution of nodes is replicated in the node activation. Although the\ncorrelation between node strength and random walk dynamics in undirected networks has been\nestablished before8 (including full\ncorrelation9,10), the findings reported\nhere are more general since they are related to any directed weighted network, such as the WWW\nand the airport network.

            "text": "We obtained r for various real networks (Table I), including the fully correlated networks mentioned\nabove. To interpret these data, we recall that a small r means\nthat a hub (large in or out strength) in topology is not necessarily a center of activity.\nNotably, in all cases considered r is greater for the in strength than for\nthe out strength. This may be understood with a trivial example of a node from which a high\nnumber of links emerge (implying large out strength) but which has only very few inbound\nlinks. This node, in a random walk model, will be rarely occupied and thus cannot be a center\nof activity, though it will strongly affect the rest of the network by sending activation to\nmany other targets. Understanding why a hub in terms of in strength may fail to be very active\nis more subtle. Consider a central node receiving links from many other nodes arranged in a\ncircle, i.e., the central node has a large in strength but with the surrounding nodes\npossessing small in strength. In other words, if a node i receives\nseveral links from nodes with low activity, this node i will\nlikewise be fairly inactive. In order to further analyze the latter case, we may examine the\ncorrelations between the frequency of visits to each node i and the\ncumulative hierarchical in and out strengths of that node. The hierarchical\ndegree17\u201319 of a network node\nprovides a natural extension of the traditional concept of node degree. The immediate\nneighbors of a node i are called the first hierarchical level\nof i. The subsequent hierarchical levels are\nobtained as follows. The level h+1\ncontains the neighbors of the nodes of level h. The cumulative\nhierarchical out strength of a node i at the hierarchical level\nh corresponds to the sum of the weights of the\nedges extending from the hierarchical level h\u22121\nto the level h, plus the out strengths obtained from\nhierarchy 1 to h\u22121.\nSimilarly, the cumulative in strength of a node i at hierarchical level\nh is the sum of the weights of the edges from\nhierarchical level h to the previous level\nh\u22121,\nplus the in strengths obtained from hierarchy 1 to h\u22121.\nThe traditional in and out strengths are, respectively, the cumulative hierarchical in and out\nstrengths at hierarchical level 1 (see Supplementary Methods in Refs. 20 for an illustration of hierarchical levels). Because complex networks\nare also small world structures, it suffices to consider hierarchies up to two or three\nlevels.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have established (i) a set of conditions for full correlation between\ntopological and dynamical features of directed complex networks and demonstrated that (ii)\nZipf\u2019s law can be naturally derived for fully correlated networks. Result (i) is of\nfundamental importance for studies relating the dynamics and connectivity in networks, with\ncritical practical implications. For instance, it not only demonstrates that hubs of\nconnectivity may not correspond to hubs of activity but also provides a sufficient condition\nfor achieving full correlation. Result (ii) is also of fundamental importance as it relates\ntwo of the most important concepts in complex systems, namely, Zipf\u2019s law and scale-free\nnetworks. Even though sharing the feature of power law, these two key concepts had been\nextensively studied on their own. The result reported in this work paves the way for important\nadditional investigations, especially by showing that Zipf\u2019s law may be a consequence of\ndynamics taking place in scale-free systems. In the cases where the network is not fully\ncorrelated, the Pearson coefficient may be used as a characterizing parameter. For a network\nwith very small correlation, such as the WWW links between the pages in a New Zealand domain\nanalyzed here, the reasons for hubs failing to be active could not be identified, probably\nbecause of the substantially higher complexity and heterogeneity of this network, including\nvarying levels of clustering coefficients, as compared to the neuronal networks.",
