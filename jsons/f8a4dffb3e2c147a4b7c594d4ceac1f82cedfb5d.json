Restrictions on abortion within the Anglophone West also bear most directly on the most marginal women. For example, the closure of abortion clinics resulting from US TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) laws is felt most acutely by minority women, who in pre COVID-19 times were having abortions at later gestations because of difficulty accessing the necessary resources to travel to obtain an abortion (Solazzo 2019) . The closure of clinics in the wake of COVID-19 (Abrams 2020) will likely have similarly stratified consequences for those seeking abortion. In Canada, which became the first country to completely decriminalise abortion in 1988, access to abortion in rural and remote areas is virtually non-existent, and women requiring abortions post 24 weeks must travel to the US (Shaw & Norman 2019) . Women in many other countries also face the burdens of the need to travel (Sethna & Davis 2019).",

The Turnaway Study in the US, the first longitudinal comparison of the outcomes of women who received an abortion with those who were turned away, is another noteworthy contribution (Ralph, Foster & Rocca 2020 (Sheldon et al. 2019) . Elsewhere in the humanities contemporary feminist theory about affect and emotion has been brought to bear on the ways that the political construction of the emotions frames abortion discourse (Millar 2017 (Ross 2017: 291) . It also draws attention to the relationship of abortion to other norms and practices of reproduction: the choice of abortion can only be considered autonomous in a meaningful way if the alternative choice of motherhood is viable, materially, socially and discursively (Ross & Solinger 2017) . Disability is one node of inequality that intersects with others to shape the material and discursive worlds of reproduction. Australian disability activist Nicole Lee (2019), who uses a wheelchair, writes of how her decision to have an abortion was, in a reversal to the stated norm, interrogated far less than her decision to become a mother. The stigma of disabled parenting can manifest in coercive practices, most notoriously in sterilisation, which women with disabilities continue to experience disproportionately compared to the able-bodied (Wu et al. 2019 ). Discourses of able-bodiedness also variegate abortion stigma. Claire Mckinney (2019) argues that women who are otherwise nonstigmatised (white, heterosexual, married, economically stable, able-bodied mothers)",

The nostalgic longing for the past that animates many contemporary restatements of white national belonging contains a powerful reproductive dimension that is only beginning to be theorised. In an important contribution to this project, Sarah Franklin and Fay Ginzburg argue that Trump's reproductive politics do not signify a break with the past but are, rather, a particularly virulent rearticulation of a \u2017tragically familiar grammar' that draws powerful links between \u2017traditional gender roles and family values, opposition to gay marriage, the right to gun ownership, and opposition to abortion within an overarching white settler narrative of lost American greatness' (2019: 3-4).

Scholars have documented how, across several different contexts, state restrictions on the reproductive autonomy of asylum seekers is particularly draconian. Ruth Fletcher (2014) documents a case of an acutely suicidal asylum seeker and survivor of rape who was refused an abortion by the public health authority in Ireland in 2014. Her asylum status prevented her from following the route to Britain then routinely taken by Irish abortion-seeking women. The woman was forced to continue with the pregnancy until she was 25 weeks' pregnant, when she was forced to undergo a caesarean delivery. Writing before the important constitutional amendments of 2018, Fletcher argues that this \u2017abortion refusal \u2026 reiterates just how unethical and rights-violating the substance of Irish Abortion law is \u2026 [and how it] discriminates against women in general, and women with mentalhealth issues, women with few economic resources and women with limited mobility options, in particular ' (2014: 14) . Kevin and Agutter (2018) (2016) documents, the reproductive coercion enacted at the level of the state towards asylum seekers extends beyond abortion to other areas of reproductive health; in, for example, creating conditions that make continuing with a pregnancy and raising a child unviable.

Prudence Flowers provides a historical account of a foundational tension between two groups of US anti-abortion activists: \u2017extremists' who argue that abortion should be banned entirely, and \u2017moderates' who argue for exceptions on grounds such as rape and fatal foetal anomaly. By arguing that this tension is irresolvable, Flowers dispels any notion that the anti-abortion movement is a united political force, thus demystifying some of the power and authority with which it is often invested. Pam Lowe and Sarah-Jane Page examine the rhetoric and framing devices that motivate anti-abortion activists to picket abortion clinics in the UK. They argue that this form of activism (or, seen differently, harassment) is driven by the idea that women need to be \u2017saved' from service providers who are motivated by profit, and that the discourse of \u2017saving women' they deploy is rooted in Christian beliefs aimed at ensuring souls go to heaven.

            "text": "Reproductive Justice Movement grew out of the exclusions of second wave feminism. In focusing on abortion as the primary struggle for women's reproductive freedom, white feminists of the second wave elided the concerns of Indigenous and other women of colour and erased a history of coercive practices aimed to restrict their fertility (Moreton-Robinson 2000; Nelson 2003). Thus another area of study the movement opens up is the racialized basis of state measures aimed to control reproduction. In her landmark study of the US context, Dorothy Roberts writes of how the children of enslaved African American women were commonly taken and sold and, more recently, how Latina and African American women have been subjected to practices such as coerced contraception, unsafe forms of contraception, and forced sterilisation (Roberts 1997). Carolyn Sufrin has recently called attention to the mistreatment of pregnant women who are imprisoned in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 US, disproportionately women of colour. Birthing women in prison are sometimes shackled; they are sometimes left to birth alone in their cells. Although women in prison have the constitutional right to abortion, their access to abortion is, in practice, determined by the decisions of those with institutional authority. Coercive sterilisation is also practiced. Sufrin urges us to turn our attention to what is happening \u2017behind the walls of carceral institutions, where no one else is looking, for it illuminates the political and racial control of reproduction more broadly' (2020: 39). By drawing attention to the racialized schemas that determine and are reproduced in state controls on reproduction, feminist scholars have examined how abortion politics are enmeshed in projects of nation making. Writing of the US context of the 1990s, Lauren Berlant conceptualises the public foetus as a fantasy figure upon which nationalist hopes for the future are projected; as it is publicly imagined, the figure of the foetus represents an ideal future citizen, a site for the",

            "text": "draw our attention to the Australian context, where the government has prevented asylum seekers, some of whom have become pregnant after being raped in detention, from accessing abortion. Because asylum seekers who arrive by boat are processed and detained in countries (Papua New Guinea and the Republic of Nauru) where abortion is illegal and medical facilities are under-resourced, they must travel, usually to Australia, to receive abortion care. Kevin and Agutter argue that acts such as these affirm \u2017the white Australian nation through exclusion and offshoring, showing contempt for the refugees and asylum seekers who occupy the sites that mark spaces beyond the national border' (2018: 99). Perera and Pugliese call the Australian government's refusal to provide abortion care to asylum seekers an act of state violence that constitutes \u2017part of the repertoire of -deterrence\u2016 and punishment of deterrence in the US where, in 2017, federally-funded refugee shelters were briefly prevented from facilitating an abortion. In the Supreme Court case that ultimately declared this policy unconstitutional, the US Justice Department argued that the state's facilitation of reproductive autonomy would \u2017incentivise illegal immigration' (quoted in Cromer 2019: 22).

A critical field of feminist each trimester, thus enshrining the idea of trimesters in law. It ruled that criminalising abortion in the first trimester infringed a woman's right to privacy, and prohibited states from doing so. States could require health regulations in the second trimester and, with reference to fetal viability, could prohibit abortion except to save the woman's life in the third trimester(Petchesky 1984: 289-94). In Australia, in the current period of decriminalisation, all but one jurisdiction (the ACT) has a legislated upper gestational limit beyond which abortion can only be performed under certain restricting conditions. There are now seven different upper limits across the eight jurisdictions that regulate abortion law. In two of these, there are two stage limits, different to each other(Williams et al. 2019: 211-242).Reed Boland's (2010) survey of 191 countries finds that trimesters (or other temporal calibrations of pregnancy) are a global phenomenon of law (68). While most countries allow abortion in the second trimester to save the woman's life, most do so only under limited conditions. Only 20 per cent allow second trimester abortions on broad socio-economic grounds and only 5 per cent on the pregnant person's request (75). Boland contends that, \u2017given that there are serious reasons why women have second trimester abortions', abortion should be legally permitted in all countries (2010: 67). In Australia where abortion provision is predominantly in the private sector, abortions after the first trimester cost increasingly more as the weeks pass (the clinical process becomes more complex), and stigmatisation intensifies. Abortions after twenty weeks (a common distinction in law and in the collection of statistical data) comprise about 2 per cent of all abortions in Australia. Access depends on economic resources and where women and other pregnant people live, and those who need such abortions must often travel far from home (Baird 2019: 159-160). Not only laws, but often formal and informal hospital and medical gatekeeping practices restrict and surveil these women and their health care providers (Black, Douglas & de Costa 2015). A large US study (Foster & Kimport 2013) demonstrated that it is poor and geographically disadvantaged women who are more likely to present for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f abortion beyond the first trimester, mostly for reasons of poor access to information and to health care in general, and sometimes because they are deliberately subjected to delay by anti-abortion doctors. Studies conducted elsewhere confirm the link between social disadvantage, including experience of reproductive coercion, and later presentation for abortion (e.g. Price et al. 2019; de Veld et al. 2019).Trimesterisation is, therefore, a discursive practice that makes its presence felt most acutely on the bodies of disadvantaged women when it comes to accessing abortion. Notwithstanding reference to scientific notions of foetal 'viability', which are themselves subject to contestation and change(Franklin 2014), the seven different upper limits in Australian jurisdictions show that the division of pregnancy into definitive stages is a product of political debate. It does not reflect any 'natural' distinction between stages of pregnancy nor any universal embodied experience of pregnancy. We must refuse the othering of women who have later gestation abortions. This othering is a feature of abortion scholarship. Boland (2010) cites few articles about second trimester abortion outside medicine or public health. Even his article does not mention the subject of abortion in the third trimester. We find no discussion about the history of trimesterisation. Critical feminist scholarship on later gestation abortions is thus far preliminary. The film After Tiller (Shane and Wilson 2013), a documentary which discusses the work of the four doctors who openly perform later term abortions in the US, made in the wake of the assassination of the pioneering abortion provider Dr George Tiller, is an exception in a cultural and political landscape where later gestation abortions are often stigmatised and/or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Its many different lessons include \u2017working together collectively as feminists, preserving an accurate depiction of the past, coming Menstrual Extraction (ME), the Californian radical feminist technological innovation of the 1970s, also stresses the productive nature of feminist health activism. ME was a technological and social technique for emptying the uterus; no doubt it reprised a longstanding technique of women including among Indigenous cultures(Marcotte 2016). The ME kit was a set of equipment that could be easily sourced in a local store. The use of ME to bring on a \u2017late period' avoided the question of pregnancy and was a community practice that involved sharing (it was not possible to perform on oneself). It made it \u2017almost impossible for the state toenforce restrictive laws' (Murphy 2012: 158). Murphy describes ME as \u2017iconic of the most radical goals of the movement, the self-governing of reproduction' (160, original emphasis). The diagrams of ME kits reproduced in Murphy's book are fascinating as are her descriptions of the groups of women who assembled to practice ME. Her account carefully avoids any unproblematic celebration of this radical project of mostly white American feminists. The ME women had little contact with other reproductive struggles in California. Their literature makes no reference to the contemporaneous resistance of Chicana feminists to coercive hospital sterilizations (163). Murphy places ME in an account of the historical conditions of technology, and writes that such radical endeavours are \u2017both urgently necessary and always noninnocently imbricated' (176). She also places her account of ME alongside Menstrual Regulation (MR), the historically coincident practice sponsored by the US government and NGOs in \u2017developing' countries in the US sphere of influence. MR involved the same equipment and operation as ME but a distinct social technique, in service not of \u2017feminism' but of the US anti-communist economic and military goal to induce population control by encouraging birth control, thus \u2017enrolling' women J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in broader contexts, and performs the opening rather than closing down of thinking and material practice across a range of issues. This special section, Abortion at the Edges: Politics, Practices, Performances, brings critical feminist thinking to a moment of marked change as well as stubborn continuity in the political, cultural and legal landscape of abortion. It picks up several of the themes we have canvassed in our account of scholarship so far. The articles brought together in this special section are multidisciplinary and examine transnational as well as Australian, Canadian, the UK and US contexts. The authors are based in Australia, Canada and England. Most are activists in relation to abortion or practitioners in their respective fields. Together they challenge current frameworks for thinking about abortion to move beyond individual choice and gender-focused analyses and continue to interrogate the framings of anti-abortion activism. They expand the horizons of the limited scholarship on abortions performed later in pregnancy, the categorisation (trimesterisation) of pregnancy, and the under-theorised experiences of those who have them. Two articles examine discourses of abortion in relation to modalities of injustice and inequality. Christabelle Sethna pays tribute to the vision of Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1995, 2014) and its cultural and political uptake since it was published, most recently in a popular television series. She tracks the reproductive dimensions of past and present patriarchal, racist and environmentally destructive politics to argue that the attack on reproductive rights under President Trump \u2017is not an aberration; rather, he represents the brazen culmination of racialized attacks on reproductive rights and environmental protections set in motion by the Reagan administration.'
