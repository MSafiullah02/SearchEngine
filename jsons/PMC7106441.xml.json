However, recent studies have reported that it can cause lower respiratory illness, such as pneumonia and bronchitis in infants [[3], [4], [5]]. Studies of influenza C virus have indicated that the virus is widely distributed throughout the world, and that the majority of the human population acquires immunity by first exposure in childhood [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. Despite a high seropositive rate in children (40\u201360%) and adults (80\u2013100%), detection and isolation of influenza C viruses have rarely been described [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]].",

In the antigenic analysis and HE gene phylogenetic analysis of influenza C viruses, the virus separated into six antigenic lineages: C/Taylor/1233/47 (C/Taylor lineage), C/Kanagawa/1/76 (C/Kanagawa lineage), C/Mississippi/80 (C/Mississippi lineage), C/Aichi/1/81 (C/Aichi lineage), C/Yamagata/26/81(C/Yamagata lineage), and C/Sao Paulo/378/82 (C/Sao Paulo lineage) [11,19].

After written informed consent was obtained from the legal representatives of enrolled subjects, we obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from children, and placed them into viral transport media (VTM). Clinical information of subjects, including symptoms and underlying diseases were recorded on the clinical report form. We tested the nasopharyngeal samples for 16 types of respiratory viruses using AnyplexTM II RV16 detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). Among the tested samples, 564 were positive for one or more respiratory viruses and which 383 were positive for influenza A and / or B virus (Table 1\n). Excluding the RV16 positive samples, 409 negative samples were examined for the presence of influenza C virus using M gene specific primer set containing TaqManTM probes [22].

A total of 409 samples negative for 16 respiratory viruses were examined for detection of influenza C virus. Five samples were positive for influenza C virus, including four samples from 2015 and one sample from 2016 (Table 1). Unfortunately, we only isolated C/Seoul/APD462/2015 virus. Sequence of viral genes showed only the C/Seoul/APD462/2015 virus was fully sequenced for seven segments. The phylogenetic analysis of individual genes was performed using the reference sequences from the influenza research database (IRD). As shown in the HE phylogenetic tree, C/Seoul/APD401/2015, C/Seoul/APD462/2015 and C/Cheongju/GPD805/2015 fell into the C/Sao Paulo lineage (Fig. 1\n).

In the HE gene, alanine was in position 355, instead of threonine found in C/Victoria/2/2012. Alanine at position 291 in the M gene changed to valine in C/Seoul/APD462/2015. Threonine at position 410 in the NP gene was substituted with alanine. Substitutions (V15L, L77P) at two different positions in NS were observed.

In this study, we identified influenza C virus infection in five (1.22%) of 409 respiratory samples negative for sixteen respiratory viruses from young children with ILI. According to several reports, influenza C virus commonly causes mild acute respiratory illness and/or pneumonia in pediatric populations [[3], [4], [5]]. In this study, young children with influenza C virus infections had acute respiratory illnesses, such as fever, rhinorrhea, and cough, but no pneumonia or severe respiratory illness was observed (Supplementary data 1). Thielen BK, et al. reported that influenza C virus was detected among 0.58% of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection, and 0.48% of outpatients, in Minnesota from 2013 to 2016 [18]. They found that influenza C viruses were most frequent among young children, but occurred in all ages. Influenza C viruses in our study were detected from March to May (Supplementary data 2). This result is consistent with Japanese studies that reported influenza C viruses are mostly isolated between January and June, and usually occur after peaks of influenza A epidemics [11].",

In this study, we confirmed that influenza C viruses belonging to the C/Sao Paulo antigenic group were detected in South Korea. In addition, a re-assortment event was observed in the C/Seoul/APD462/2015 strain, which contains HE, PB1 and PB2 genes belonging to the C/Sao Paulo related lineage, and NP and P3 genes belonging to the C/Mississippi related lineage. Particularly, all segments of C/Seoul/APD462/2015 strain showed high homology to C/Tokyo/4/2014 and C/Victoria/2/2102 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Interestingly, Odagiri et al. reported that viruses isolated from the Philippines in 2011 to 2013 were related to C/Victoria/2/2012 [17].

Approximately 1.22% of young children with ILI negative for sixteen respiratory viruses during the influenza season were identified with influenza C virus infections. Influenza C virus infections in children are known to be capable of co-infections, but this study focused on identifying influenza C virus in samples negative for sixteen respiratory viruses. Considering the case of co-infections that we have not tested, it is assumed that the actual rate of influenza C virus infection among children will be high. Therefore, expanded investigations and serologic analysis of influenza C virus are needed to elucidate disease burden and epidemiology of influenza C virus.",
