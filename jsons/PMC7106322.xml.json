            "text": "Guinea pigs are incapable of endogenous synthesis of vitamin C.1 Guinea pigs require a dietary source of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) because they lack L-gluconolactone oxidase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of ascorbic acid from glucose. Nonbreeding adult guinea pigs require 10 mg/kg daily of ascorbic acid. Higher levels should be provided for growing and pregnant animals; 30 mg/kg/daily of vitamin C is recommended for a pregnant sow.2, 3 The recommended diet for pet guinea pigs should include pellets formulated specifically for this species, grass hay (e.g., timothy, orchard grass, oat), and supplemented fresh vegetables. Alfalfa pellets are suitable for young, growing, and pregnant guinea pigs. After the guinea pig is 1 year of age and fully developed, a timothy-based pellet, which provides less calcium and more fiber, is better suited to prevent urolithiasis, obesity, and digestive and dental problems. Good-quality hay should be available at all times. Fruits, rolled oats, and dry cereals should only be offered as treats in very small quantities, if at all.3 Commercially available guinea pig pellets are fortified with ascorbic acid; however, approximately half of the initial vitamin C content may be oxidized and lost 90 days after the diet has been mixed. It may be better to assume that the pellets no longer contain adequate levels of vitamin C and instead supplement this vitamin in a tablet form or as fresh greens to ensure adequate daily intake occurs. Foods that contain high levels of ascorbic acid are leafy greens (e.g., kale, parsley, beet greens, chicory, spinach), red and green peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, kiwi fruit, and oranges. Vitamin C can be added to the water at 1 g/L; however, water supplemented with added vitamin C loses more than 50% of its vitamin C content within 24 hours, and consequently the drinking water must be changed daily.3\n",

Limit treats to not more than 1 teaspoon per day for such items as grains, dried apples, raisins, figs, hazelnuts, and sunflower seeds.

Wake the hamster gently if it is sleeping, because they are deep sleepers and will often bite if startled. A calm hamster may be receptive to being scooped up in the palm of the hand. When full restraint is required, a modification of the scruff grip is used. Hamsters have an abundance of loose skin over the back and shoulders, so a full-handed grip is required to achieve complete immobilization. Grasp the skin between the tips of all 4 fingers and the base of the thumb and lower palm of your hand.3 A small cloth may help with restraint and reduce the risk of being bitten. Adjustment of the scruff grip may be necessary if the skin is loose and the hamster is able to turn to bite the handler.

To minimize the likelihood of the gastrointestinal tract from slowing or stopping, it is important to provide caloric intake for these animals. Oxbow Critical Care for herbivores (Oxbow Hay Company, Murdock, NE USA), Emeraid Herbivore (Lafeber Company, Cornell, IL USA), or a soaked guinea pig/chinchilla pellet slurry are examples of nutritional offerings that can be fed to the anorexic rodent (e.g., guinea pig, chinchilla) patient. These animals will often eat the nutritional diets listed above directly from a dish, but they can be syringe fed if needed.16 In guinea pigs, a nasogastric tube (e.g., 3.5-French Argyle tube) may be placed to facilitate feeding anorexic patients.23\n",

Use of an otoscope, vaginal speculum, or an endoscope enables direct visualization of the cheek teeth through the narrow oral cavity. Dental specula and pouch dilators are invaluable in obtaining an adequate view of the molars and premolars. The oral cavity may need to be rinsed out with warm water via a curved-tipped syringe if food material is hindering visualization. Abnormal oral examination findings may include an uneven occlusal surface or angle of the incisors and/or cheek teeth, formation of sharp points with or without associated ulceration of the oral mucosa, food impaction, and abnormal spaces between teeth. Abscessation of the molar and the premolar apices can also occur with the overgrowth of these teeth. Careful palpation of the ventral mandible and maxilla may reveal bony protruberances that correspond to overgrowth of the apical surfaces of the cheek teeth. The apical surfaces of maxillary teeth can overgrow and impinge on the nasolacrimal duct, causing ocular discharge. The apices can also overgrow into the nasal cavity, which may result in the seeding of the sinuses with bacteria from the oral cavity, causing nasal discharge.3, 16\n",
