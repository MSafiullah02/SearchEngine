Yet, although the efficiency of those criteria has been demonstrated also in empirical networks, preventive immunization is rarely applied to real-world scenarios, where the usual approach is the a posteriori attempt to contain epidemic outbreaks using quarantine measures. Here we compare the efficiency of prevention with that of quarantine in terms of the tradeoff between the number of removed and saved nodes on both synthetic and empirical topologies. We show how, consistent with common sense, but contrary to common practice, in many cases preventing is better than curing: depending on network structure, rescuing an infected network by quarantine could become inefficient soon after the first infection.",

From a theoretical perspective, the simple removal of infected nodes is a straightforward, trivial solution to the problem of stopping an epidemic. However, in real-world scenarios, due to infection latency (the interval between the time a host becomes infectious and the time it shows signs of disease), it is common practice to try to isolate the infected nodes from the rest of the network by also taking action on the surrounding nodes. For example, in the case of the spread of disease in plants, it is usual procedure to eliminate all the susceptible hosts close to an infected one [8, 9] .

If the implementation is not prompt enough, then quarantine becomes highly inefficient, as it stops the epidemic at the price of removing many more nodes than those that would have been removed by preventive immunization. In some cases, it may even be more convenient to let the disease propagate freely rather than applying a quarantine measure. These conclusions hold very strongly for networks possessing the small-world property (i.e., having a small diameter). They hold in a weaker form for networks with a large diameter (such as planar graphs): in that case, the number of infected nodes grows more slowly, and, as a consequence, quarantine remains convenient for longer times.",

This applies, for example, to the case of quarantining people who have come into contact with a dangerous pathogen: although they clearly belong to some sort of social network, its structure would be, in most cases, elusive. Nevertheless, when the contact pattern is known, it is possible to devise a more refined quarantine strategy, which removes a node only if this saves on average more than one other node. We investigate this aspect by introducing an improved quarantine strategy that takes into account the average effect, on the epidemic process, of whether or not a node is quarantined. We show that the set of nodes that should be quarantined to halt an epidemic can be significantly smaller than the set of healthy neighbors surrounding infected nodes. Nevertheless, even this improved quarantine strategy is not more efficient than preventive immunization.",

Each individual sits on a node of a network and can be in one of three states: susceptible (S), infected (I), or removed (R). The total number of individuals is N . At a given time step, a list of infected nodes is created and each node in the list tries to infect each of his or her susceptible neighbors: each attempt is successful with probability p. After all the nodes in the list have been considered, they all recover (i.e., with probability 1) switching to state R. Time is increased by 1 and the next iteration begins with the compilation of the list of newly infected nodes: p is the only parameter of the dynamics. In the initial configuration, a single randomly selected node is infected, all others being susceptible. In a finite system, the dynamics unavoidably reach a final absorbing configuration with no infective nodes: all individuals are either untouched by the epidemic (in state S) or are recovered (state R) after having been infected. The fraction R of recovered nodes in the final state plays the role of the order parameter: for small values of p the epidemic reaches only a small number of individuals around the initial seed (R is close to 0 for large systems); for large p instead an extensive set of individuals is reached by the infection, so that R is finite in large systems. The two regimes are separated by a critical value (the epidemic threshold p c ) distinguishing for N \u2192 \u221e between extensive spreading R(p) > 0 for p > p c and small-scale local spreading R(p) \u2192 0 for p p c . We consider two classes of synthetic networks representing the static contact pattern among individuals. On the one hand, there are low-diameter networks (i.e., having the small-world property), represented by Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi graphs or by scale-free networks with degree distribution P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 with \u03b3 = 3 and k min = 3, built using the uncorrelated configuration model [16] . The network size is in all cases N = 10 5 . The average degree is, unless specified otherwise, k = 5 ( k \u2248 5.01 for the scale-free network). The epidemic threshold is, with very good approximation, p c = k /[ k 2 \u2212 k ] [17] . On the other hand, we also consider another type of network, which does not possess the small-world property: a random geometric graph, built in the two-dimensional square of unit size by connecting nodes at Euclidean distance smaller than d = 0.003 95 ( k \u2248 5.04). In this topology, the diameter grows asymptotically as a power of the number of nodes [18] , as in a regular lattice.",

Otherwise, only small outbreaks can occur even for extremely infective pathogens (p = 1). Therefore, by removing a number of nodes sufficient to dismantle the giant component, it is possible to prevent large outbreaks. By means of different strategies [5, [20] [21] [22] , it is possible to reduce this number to values close to the theoretical minimum, thus providing an optimal preventive immunization. If the removal of a fraction n r of nodes destroys the giant component, one can consider that a fraction n OP = 1 \u2212 n r of nodes is effectively saved from infection. In Appendix A, we provide details on how n OP is determined in our study.",

The answer to this question is not completely trivial: for small values of the spreading probability p, the epidemic soon becomes extinct spontaneously, touching a very limited number of individuals; a quarantine intervention in such a case implies the removal of more individuals than those likely to be reached by the epidemic. For larger values of p it is a matter of timeliness: if the intervention is quick enough, quarantine may be useful; otherwise, it is more costly than allowing the epidemic to spontaneously evolve and disappear. This is confirmed in Fig. 1 , where we plot the ratio between the fraction n Q of nodes saved by the quarantine strategy and the fraction n NI = 1 \u2212 R(t \u2192 \u221e) of nodes that are not reached by the infection in the absence of any intervention. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that for p up to the epidemic threshold, quarantine is never convenient: it removes more individuals than those that would be hit by the freely evolving epidemics. For larger values of p, quarantining may be very useful, but only if promptly implemented: for example, for an Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi graph and p = 0.3, the implementation of quarantine actually saves more individuals than those that would have survived with no intervention only if applied as long as R < 0.12. For a scale-free network, the effect is even more noticeable. A different scenario applies instead for the random geometric graph. In that case, above the threshold (which is of the order of 0.8) the ratio n Q /n NI remains very large up to values of R close to 1: quarantine is more convenient than no intervention practically at any time during the epidemic.",

In practice, the latter is implemented by removing a fraction 1 \u2212 n OP of the nodes, breaking the network into small clusters so that any outbreak cannot grow large (see Appendix A for details). In particular, we compare the global fraction n OP of nodes saved by applying the preventive immunization strategy with the fraction n Q saved by applying the quarantine strategy. Also in this case, the efficiency of quarantine depends on its timeliness, i.e., on the value of R at the time it is applied. Figure 2 shows that, for the two small-world networks, n Q decays very rapidly below n OP : unless applied in the very early stages of the epidemic, quarantine is less efficient than preventive immunization. The only exception to this rule occurs for small values of p: in such cases, the epidemic spontaneously becomes extinct after relatively short times, so that preventive immunization is never more efficient. Again, the effect is more dramatic when the topology is scale-free: quarantine becomes highly inconvenient as soon as only a few percent of the population have been hit by the epidemics. For the random geometric graph, the effect is once again considerably milder. The ratio decays linearly with R with the same slope for any value of p.

For example, it is reasonable to quarantine all people who have been exposed to a dangerous pathogen because, in most cases, the structure of the social network to which they belong is not well known.

However, one can use it as an approximation, provided that u l is computed after the exclusion from the network of all other nodes candidate for quarantine, as well as the exclusion of all removed (R) nodes. Moreover, we can replace the first p factor with the probability p q = [1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) n q ] that the infection is transmitted to V q by one of its n q infected neighbors. As in the case of the \"informed\" preventive immunization, I q with p < 1 will provide information on the average expected effect of not quarantining a node, i.e., it will not exclude the possibility that a much larger number of nodes than the expected value is actually reached by the infection. Conservatively setting p = 1 allows for the identification of the trivial cases of V q nodes surrounded by infected nodes only.",

Especially for high values of p, there could be situations in which a high number of V q nodes are simultaneously protecting a small number of healthy nodes. In such cases, I q (V q ) will likely be greater than 1 for most of the candidates V q , but quarantining all of them will save a small number of nodes at the expense of removing many. Avoiding the quarantine of all the V q nodes that protect the same (small) set of healthy nodes could be the most efficient strategy. A very simple procedure for taking this into account is implemented by excluding from the network all infected and removed nodes, and then counting the expected number of V q nodes that will be infected (i.e., the sum of their p q values) in any network component. If that sum plus the number of healthy nodes in the component is smaller than the total number of V q nodes We tested the combination of these criteria on the WAN topology. In Fig. 6 we show how the method substantially reduces the number of nodes to be quarantined. In Fig. 5 we show that, although it translates into a net improvement in the average fraction of nodes saved by the quarantine, this does not affect our main conclusion: preventive immunization is still much more efficient than quarantine shortly after the first infection.",

We find that preventing is almost always better than curing, unless the quarantine approach is applied in the very early stages of the spreading process. The time window for quarantine to be convenient is extremely short for topologies with small diameter (possessing the small-world property) and is further reduced if the average degree is increased or the degree distribution is broader. If quarantine is applied too late, it may even become more costly than leaving the contagion to evolve freely until its spontaneous disappearance. Quarantine performs better in networks with large diameter such as planar graphs and the like. In such a case, the number of infected nodes does not grow exponentially with time, and this makes the quarantine strategy relatively efficient for longer intervals.",

To implement this approach, we use the procedure described by Morone and Makse [5] .

After that optimal point, additional node removals will not lead to an overall reduction of network component size (so that X t will decrease approaching 0). We assume the number t * corresponding to the maximum value of X t is the number of nodes sacrificed by a preventive immunization approach. Figure 7 shows that this value t * almost perfectly matches the valuet calculated via the usual criterion as the number of nodes to be removed such that the largest connected cluster remaining is smaller than \u221a N [21] .
