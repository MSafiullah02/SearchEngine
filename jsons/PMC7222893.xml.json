However, little is known about how organizations first learn about innovations, which external sources of information about innovations they rely on, or whether differences in acquisition of information may be associated with differences in adoption behavior. The current study uses qualitative interviews with community mental health agency/clinic leaders to provide real world examples of the external sources and processes that influence information acquisition. The objectives of this study are: (1) identify commonly accessed external sources of information on innovative practices in community mental health clinics; and (2) explore differences in acquisition of information between clinics with higher levels of innovation training adoption versus lower levels of innovation training adoption during a statewide initiative.",

The Community Technical Assistance Center (CTAC) was founded in 2011 and funded by the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) to provide training, consultation, and education around business and clinical skills. At the time of the present study, CTAC provided assistance to all state-licensed clinics serving children, even if children comprised only a small proportion of the case mix. The scope of the CTAC has since been expanded to serve all outpatient mental health clinics licensed by the state of New York (www.ctacny.org).",

The CTAC has since broadened its offerings and modified its focus, but at the time of data collection in the present study the CTAC offered 33 trainings. Eighteen of these trainings targeted evidence-based clinical practices, twelve trainings targeted improvement of business practices, and three hybrid trainings targeted improvement of both clinical and business practices. Clinical (or EBP) trainings included topics such as cognitive-behavior therapy, strengthening families, and motivational interviewing. Business (or QI) trainings included topics such as collaborative documentation, quality assurance and risk management, and financial self-assessment. A list of trainings is provided in the Appendix, and more detail about them may be found elsewhere (Chor et al. 2014).",

Chor et al. (2014) found that these training adoption levels were significantly associated with the number of trainings a clinic accessed overall (i.e. higher-adopting clinics accessed more trainings), offering preliminary evidence that they represent meaningful clinic-level engagement in innovation training activities.

Study results also suggest that oversight agencies and technical assistance centers aiming to increase adoption should work to develop collaborative relationships with clinic leaders and support them in developing new networks and partnerships. However, the configuration of each service system will dictate which oversight agency is most salient (i.e. state, county, or city), and further research is needed to determine if these findings generalize to other service systems.

First, it is important to note that the numbers presented in tables and throughout the results section represent the proportion of leaders who mentioned a source or theme in their interview. Given that interviews did not include prompts related to every source (e.g. OMH, government) or theme (e.g. active searching, bottom-up communication), we should not conclude that a lack of mention indicates a true absence of the source or theme. Further, the reliance on retrospective accounts of clinic leaders introduces potential for social desirability bias, and restricting the sample to a single service system limits generalizability of findings to other states and contexts.",

Future studies are also needed to examine several gaps in this study\u2019s findings. Quantitative surveys can build on this study\u2019s results by asking clinic leaders to indicate whether or not they access a particular source of information, how important/useful the source is, and how often they access it. Future studies should also examine how information is used in making adoption decisions, whether different sources provide different types of information, whether there are differences in access to and acquisition of information about clinical practices versus business practices, and whether accessing information from particular sources improves adoption. Insight into these questions can further support strategies to increase dissemination and adoption of innovations.",

Approximately one quarter of leaders did not name the state OMH as a source of information, and several stated that they did not perceive the OMH as an important source. Collecting further information about such cases may provide insights into how state or local oversight agencies can improve their outreach and increase clinic buy-in. In addition, future studies should focus on leaders who report being overwhelmed with incoming information in order to develop strategies to help them manage and assimilate information about innovations. Finally, application of social network theory and analysis can be used to build on this study\u2019s results by examining how social networks influence access to information that facilitates selection and adoption of innovations (Palinkas et al. 2011; Valente et al. 2007).",
