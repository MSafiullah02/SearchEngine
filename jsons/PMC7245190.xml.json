There is an urgent need for guidance in the practice of Hepatology. A taskforce with 22 members from 16 countries or administration regions in Asia\u2013Pacific regions was formed and through intense interaction via webinar, this guidance was made. Our Taskforce has also formed the electronic database to collect liver injury data from patients who suffered from COVID-19 in Asia\u2013Pacific region \u201cAPCOLIS\u201d study (\u201cAPASL COVID Liver Injury Spectrum) (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/covid-liver). These recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible and modifiable according to local conditions. To more fully characterize the quality of evidence supporting the recommendations, the Guideline Committee of the APASL adopted a Class (reflecting benefit versus risk) and Level (assessing strength or certainty) of Evidence reported with each recommendation [2].",

According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplet, by direct contact with infected people or contact with contaminated surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person. Airborne transmission may be possible when procedures that generate aerosols are performed on infected patients. Such procedures include endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In addition, several studies reported that SARS-CoV-2, were isolated from feces and urine patients [1]. But it is unclear whether human-to-human transmission can be implemented by the above routes. Asymptomatic patients can also be a source of infection [3]. Early dynamics studies in Wuhan suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6\u20137 days and a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8\u20138.9) [4].",

Of 1141 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, 183 (16%) presented with gastrointestinal symptoms only [6]. The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein [68.6% (58.2\u201378.2)], decreased lymphocyte count [57.4% (44.8\u201369.5)] and increased lactate dehydrogenase [51.6% (31.4\u201371.6)]. Ground-glass opacities [80.0% (67.3\u201390.4)] and bilateral pneumonia [73.2% (63.4\u201382.1)] were the most frequently reported findings on computed tomography. The overall estimated proportion of severe cases and case-fatality rate was 25.6% (17.4\u201334.9) and 3.6% (1.1\u20137.2), respectively [5]. According to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), patients > 65 years old, with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic liver disease are at higher risk for severe COVID-19.7 More prominent laboratory abnormalities (lymphopenia, elevated D-dimer, LDH) may be risk factors for poor outcome [8]. Recently, risk score model such as CALL (Comorbidities, older Age, higher Lactate dehydrogenase and lower Lymphocyte count) had been shown to have positive and negative predictive values of disease progression of 50.7% (38.9% - 62.4%) and 98.5% (94.7% - 99.8%), respectively [9].",

Average expression level in hepatocytes is twentyfold less than the expression level in the cholangiocytes population. In fact ACE expression level in cholangiocytes is comparable to Alveolar Type 2 cells [14]. Studies in liver ductal organoids inoculated with COVID-19 found that human liver ductal organoids are susceptible to COVID- 19 infection and support robust viral replication, and COVID-19 infection impairs the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes [15]. In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy, ACE2 expression in the liver was down regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day and returned to normal level on seventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. The experimental results implied the up regulation of ACE2 expression in the liver was caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells during acute liver injury [16]. Considering the COVID-19 patients with liver injury mainly manifests as elevation of serum aminotransferases ( cholestatic enzymes are elevated less commonly), it seems that hepatocytes are not targeted by COVID-19,or at least not through ACE2. Liver damages in patients might not be caused directly by viral infection of hepatocytes and liver injury in COVID-19 may thus have alternative pathophysiology and etiology.",

In the absence of influenza virus particles in the liver, \u201ccollateral damage\u201d resulting from expanding CD8+ T-cell populations has been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver injury during influenza infections [18] In keeping with this, post-mortem liver biopsy in patients who died from COVID-19 showed only microvesicular steatosis, accompanied by hyperactivation of T cells suggesting that liver injury is likely immune mediated rather than direct cytopathic damage as described in other viral respiratory disease [19]. The overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor,IL-6, (IL)-2, IL-7, interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10, monocyte chemo attractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1 and IL-11) have been described as a cytokine storm, leading to an increased risk of vascular hyperpermeability, multiorgan failure, and eventually death when the high cytokine concentrations are unabated over time [20]. Activation of coagulation pathways during the immune response to infection results in over production of pro inflammatory cytokines leading to multiorgan injury. During inflammation, the anticoagulant concentrations declined due to reduced production and increasing consumption. This procoagulat-anticoagulant imbalance predisposes to the development of microthrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure [21].",

In general, cancer patients are more susceptible to infections than individuals without cancer, due to systemic immune suppressive state due to malignancy and anticancer treatments [66]. Therefore, these patients might be at increased risk of COVID-19 and have a poorer prognosis. In a recent study on 1590 COVID-19 cases (admitted for acute respiratory COVID-19) from 575 hospitals in China, it was found that 18 (1%; 95% CI 0.61\u20131.65) had a history of cancer (although none of the patients had history of HCC). This figure seemed to be higher than the incidence of cancer in the overall Chinese population [285.83 (0.29%) per 100 000 people [2015 cancer epidemiology statistics], suggesting that cancer patients were more susceptible to infection [67]. Twenty five percent of cancer patients had chemotherapy or surgery in the last 1 month. Patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events. Also, patients with cancer deteriorated more rapidly than those without cancer [median time to severe events: 13 vs 43 days (20\u2013not reached), p < 0.0001; Hazard ratio 3.56 (95% CI 1.65\u20137.69), after adjusting for age]. After adjusting for other risk factors, including age, smoking history, and other co-morbidities, patients who had undergone chemotherapy or surgery within last 1 month had higher odds of developing severe events [OR = 5.34 (1.80\u201316.18); p = 0.0026] as compared to patients who had not undergone such procedure within the last 1 month. However, concerns remain regarding generalizability of the study, with such a small sample size with a large amount of heterogeneity (various cancer types with different biological behaviors, highly variable disease courses, and diverse treatment strategies). However, the specific clinical strategies for patients with HCC remain unclear. This is a yet published scenario with scarce data. It is unknown whether patients with HCC are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 by virtue of their malignancy. The effect of TACE, immunotherapy (Check point inhibitors) and kinase inhibitors on risk of getting COVID-19 and developing severe COVID-19 if infected remains unknown.",
