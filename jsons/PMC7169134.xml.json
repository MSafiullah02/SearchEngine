These viruses can cause a wide variety of diseases, in particular respiratory and enteric, but also including hepatic, renal and neuronal infection 1, 2. CoVs are divided into three genera, namely, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, as well as a tentative new genus, the Deltacoronavirus\n3. Well\u2010known representatives are porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory CoV (PRCoV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); canine CoV (CCoV), feline CoV (FCoV), bovine CoV (BCoV), human CoVs (HCoVs) including HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010NL63 and HCoV\u2010HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated CoV (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS\u2010CoV); murine hepatitis virus (MHV); and the avian CoV infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey CoV (TCoV) 4.",

Epithelial cells cover the inner and outer linings of body cavities and act as a primary barrier to infection by microorganisms, entering their host via body cavities, such as the respiratory or intestinal tract 12. Primary replication of CoVs is often confined to respiratory or gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells 13. Epithelial cells are functionally polarized; their surface exhibits two distinguishable regions, which are called apical domain and basolateral domain 14. The apical membrane faces the luminal (external) compartment and contains proteins that determine the cells' primary functions such as secretion and absorption, whereas the basolateral domain faces the systemic (internal) compartment, that is, tissues and blood 15, 16.",

            "text": "The entry of several CoVs in polarized epithelial cells has been investigated for several decades. As early as 1994, Rossen and colleagues analyzed the entry of TGEV in filter\u2010grown polarized LLC\u2010pig kidney 1 (LLC\u2010PK1) cells, a line of pig kidney epithelial cells, using radioactive labeling, immunoprecipitation and electron microscopy. The results showed that TGEV infection was restricted to the apical plasma membrane 18. In 2001, Rossen et al. similarly analyzed the entry of FCoV and CCoV in polarized epithelial LLC\u2010PK1 cells expressing the recombinant feline aminopeptidase\u2010N (fAPN), which acts as a receptor for these viruses, and compared it with TGEV. The results showed that FCoV and CCoV, like TGEV, establish their infection into polarized epithelial cells specifically by entry through the apical membrane 19. The same pattern has subsequently also been found with a large number of other CoVs including HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010NL63, HCoV\u2010HKU1, BCoV, SARS\u2010CoV and MHV 4, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. Recently, Pratelli reported a study with CCoV in filter\u2010grown polarized epithelia primary dog kidney cells (A72 cells) and epithelia feline kidney cells (CrFK cells) showing productive infection both through the apical and basolateral cell membrane 29.",

            "text": "It is clear that the S glycoprotein of CoV mediates viral attachment to the cellular receptor and subsequent entry into cells 10, 11. Thus, exploration of the distribution of cellular receptor in polarized epithelial in relation to CoV entry is important for understanding virus invasion. It is well known that porcine aminopeptidase\u2010N (pAPN), the cellular receptor of TGEV, is primarily expressed on the apical side in polarized epithelial cells 18, 30. Rossen et al. chose LLC\u2010PK1 cells, which are derived from the proximal tubule of porcine kidney, as their in vitro model for determining the association of TGEV entry with localization of pAPN 18. Furthermore, the authors performed a confocal laser scanning microscope method of filter\u2010grown LLC\u2010PK1 cells, which allows optical sections to be cut either in the horizontal plane (XY section) or in the vertical plane (XZ section) to determine the plasma membrane distribution of the pAPN receptor. The results showed that when the LLC\u2010PK1 cells were not fully polarized, pAPN was expressed on both apical and basolateral sides; in contrast, expression of the pAPN was limited to the apical side in fully polarized LLC\u2010PK1 monolayers 18, consistent with TGEV entry into these cells to be mediated by pAPN. Similarly, also the entry of HCoV\u2010229E and FCoV through the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells correlated with the apical expression of their cognate aminopeptidase\u2010N (APN) receptor 19, 20, 24, 31, 32, 33, 34. Besides, the apical distribution of angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme II (ACE2; HCoV\u2010NL63 receptor) mediated the apical entry of HCoV\u2010NL63 24, 26. For their study of polarized MHV entry, Rossen et al. used porcine LLC\u2010PK1 cells stably expressing the carcinoembryonic antigen receptor for MHV (MHVR) and confirmed that the apical entry of the virus could be explained by the specific apical expression of its receptor 23, 35. As far as the entry of SARS\u2010CoV is concerned, Tseng et al. first reported the apical entry of this virus in polarized Calu\u20103 (a human lung cancer cell line) cells in 2005 using immunofluorescence staining, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy 17. In the same year, Jia et al. investigated interactions between SARS\u2010CoV and human airway epithelia using native tissue and a primary culture model of polarized, well\u2010differentiated tracheal and bronchial epithelia 21. They also confirmed SARS\u2010CoV receptor, ACE2, to be expressed in greater abundance on the apical surface of the polarized cells 21, 36, 37. Furthermore, Ren et al. analyzed the entry of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes bearing SARS\u2010CoV S protein in polarized Vero (a line of monkey kidney cell line), Calu\u20103 and Caco\u20102 cells (a human colon cancer cell line) using confocal immunofluorescence and surface biotinylation 12. Their results indicated that SARS\u2010CoV S mediated apical entry into polarized epithelial cells. Furthermore, the authors used human respiratory tissues in an immunohistochemical assay. They found a strong expression of ACE2 on the epithelium of almost all tracheal glands, and no ACE2 was detected in the lower bronchi of any of the tissues. These results clearly showed ACE2 to be present on the epithelia of certain parts of the respiratory tract and to mediate SARS\u2010CoV entry 12, 38. The findings indicate the importance of CoV receptors in the context of entry of these viruses into polarized epithelial cells. It can thus be concluded that CoVs bind to particular host cell molecules and that their specific entry route is mediated by the distribution of these molecules on polarized epithelial cells. The most likely mechanism for the sorting of intracellular budding viruses to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane side involves their interaction with a membrane cellular receptor, which is polarized and targeted to a specific destination. To some extent, it explains the entry of CoV 29. In our recent study, we infected polarized Vero cells and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) with PEDV and revealed by using immunofluorescence assays the apical entry of PEDV into both these cell types (unpublished data). Currently available reports have claimed that pAPN might serve as a functional receptor for PEDV 39, 40, 41. Interestingly, Vero cells are of monkey rather than pig origin and do not express pAPN; therefore, the apical entry of PEDV is independent of the pAPN molecule. Identification of the actual cellular receptor of PEDV is important for understanding the interaction between PEDV and its receptor. Whether there are additional other mechanisms or factors contributing to the entry of CoVs into polarized cells remains unclear.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are assembled in their host cells from the structural proteins and genome RNA by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum and early Golgi membranes, after which virions are transported through the Golgi complex and secreted out of the cell 42. Such processes are complex, and as a consequence, understanding the release of CoVs from polarized epithelial cells is more complicated than their entry. It has been reported that TGEV was preferentially released from the apical plasma membrane. In this study, the amounts of infectious TGEV particles released into the apical and basolateral media of infected LLC\u2010PK1 cells were determined by plaque assay. The results showed that 30\u2010fold more pfu had accumulated in the apical medium than in the basolateral medium 18. The same pattern was also found upon infections of polarized epithelial cells with HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010NL63, HCoV\u2010HKU1, SARS\u2010CoV and BCoV by virus titration or real\u2010time PCR 12, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 43. In 1997, Lin et al. demonstrated that BCoV isolated from enteric (enteric BCoV, EBCoV) and respiratory (respiratory BCoV, RBCoV) tract infections was released through the apical surfaces of the polarized HRT\u201018G cells, an epithelioid human rectal tumor cell line 28. Later, in 2000, the same was shown by Wang et al. for HCoV\u2010229E infection of polarized airway epithelia 20, whereas the apical release of HCoV\u2010OC43 from polarized primary epithelial cells was reported by Dijkman et al. in 2013 24. In contrast to these examples of apical release, however, CCoV, FCoV and MHV were found to be released from the opposite side 12, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 43. Thus, Rossen et al. studied FCoV and CCoV release from polarized porcine epithelial LLC\u2010PK1 cells stably expressing the recombinant fAPN and observed the progeny viruses to accumulate preferentially in the basolateral medium of the epithelial cells 19. To investigate whether the differential release of different CoVs is determined by the cells rather than the viruses, these same authors also analyzed the release of TGEV and MHV from the same polarized cells. Using the porcine LLC\u2010PK1 expressing the MHV receptor to make them susceptible to this murine virus, they confirmed by virus titration the apical release of TGEV, whereas infectious MHV was predominantly released into the basolateral fluid 18, 22. For PEDV, an important pathogen circulating in Asia, but which recently also emerged in Europe 44, 45, we investigated the release in polarized VERO and IEC cells and found the virus to be secreted apically using virus titration and real\u2010time PCR (unpublished data). Taken together, the observations demonstrate that there are two patterns for CoV release from the polarized epithelial cells. As epithelial cells are the initial target cells for most CoV infections, the pivotal role in the pathogenesis of viral infections is obvious. The virus specifically released from the apical surface is targeted to the lumen; hence, the resulting infection is more likely to be restricted to the epithelial surface. In contrast, basolateral release should provide access to the blood and lymph vessels, resulting in a systemic infection 23, 46. Clarification of the different release routines of CoVs may provide important insight into the mechanisms of transmission and pathogenesis and will facilitate the design of effective antiviral strategies to control CoV infection.",

Tseng et al. infected an established cell line of human bronchial epithelial origin, Calu\u20103, which is a relevant cell culture model for SARS\u2010CoV infection despite its pulmonary adenocarcinoma origin 17. The functional receptor for SARS\u2010CoV, ACE2, is preferentially expressed on the apical surface of these cells 12, 17, 21, 43. Although the authors, as mentioned earlier, demonstrated that SARS\u2010CoV enters these cells through the apical domain of polarized Calu\u20103 cells, they also found the release to be almost exclusively through this domain. Because SARS\u2010CoV naturally enters its host through the mucosa of the respiratory tract and the eyes, Jia et al. described the entry and release of the virus in polarized human airway epithelia. Their results were consistent with those of Tseng et al. 17, 21. They used native lung tissue and a model of well\u2010differentiated cultures of primary human airway epithelia and showed ACE2 receptor expression to increase and appear more abundantly on the apical side with the differentiation state of epithelia. SARS\u2010CoV preferentially exited via the apical surface of the well\u2010differentiated cells 10, 21, 47.",

            "text": "In September 2012, the MERS\u2010CoV drew attention as a new cause of severe respiratory illness in humans in the Middle East 48, 49, 50. Patients with confirmed MERS\u2010CoV infection presented with a spectrum of disease symptoms ranging from mild influenza\u2010like illness to severe pneumonia accompanied by respiratory and renal failure and resulting in death; the case fatality rate (CFR) presently stands at 45%, in contrast to the 7% CFR of SARS 51. For MERS\u2010CoV, no animal reservoir or intermediate host(s) has been definitely implicated in transmission. Limited human\u2010to\u2010human transmission has occurred within several clusters of cases in many countries 52. MERS\u2010CoV infects primary human bronchial epithelial Calu\u20103 cells and primary human kidney cells, and CD26 (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) was identified as the cellular receptor for MERS\u2010CoV 53. Tao et al. indicated that MERS\u2010CoV could not infect the cell lines without CD26 expression including ACE2\u2010expressing A549 cells, embryonic kidney 293 cells and ACE2\u2010expressing 293 cells and infected the primary human bronchial epithelial Calu\u20103 cells, which are target cell lines for MERS\u2010CoV and SARS with the distribution of CD26 being indiscriminately expressed on the entire membrane of cells by sequential images caught by z\u2010scanning and ACE2 being distinctly expressed on the apical side. Then, these two HCoVs infected both sides of the polarized epithelial Calu\u20103 cells. SARS\u2010CoV infected and released almost exclusively through the apical side, whereas MERS\u2010CoV was indeed capable of doing so through either side and released through both routes. It should be noted that there was a nearly 100\u2010fold\u2010lower titer released from the apical side when infection was carried out from the basolateral rather than apical routes 54. Because of the bilateral entry and release, MERS\u2010CoV caused the lateral spread, human\u2010to\u2010human transmission and vertical transmission, whereas viral particles can be detected in serum and plasma 49, 50.",

            "text": "So far, two main patterns of entry into and release from polarized epithelial cells apply to most CoVs. One is apical entry and apical release, and the other is apical entry and basolateral release. The apical release allows a rapid lateral spread over the respiratory or intestinal epithelium; virus is deposited from infected cells into the lung or gut lumen followed by efficient infection of new nearby target cells. A schematic drawing of the process is shown in Figure 1A. SARS\u2010CoV, for instance, mainly infects through the respiratory tract 12, 17, 43. The new progeny virions are released from the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells and subsequently infect adjacent epithelial cells. However, these virions do not easily cross the epithelial cell layer and infect tissues; hence, the infection is maintained at the surface of the epithelial cells and causes a massive lateral spread. This condition enables efficient horizontal transmission by respiratory secretions, body fluids or body contact and leads to a widespread dissemination into the population 55, 56. In contrast, basolateral release supports the vertical transmission from the infected epithelia to blood and lymph vessels, consequently promoting the establishment of a systemic infection 57, 58, and a proposed schematic drawing is shown in Figure 1B. Virions reach underlying cells and tissues, pass into the bloodstream and are transported around the body, circulating through body fluids. MHV, CCoV and FCoV, which were found to exhibit this pattern of virus release from polarized epithelial cells, cause a systemic infection 19, 22, 23. The current knowledge regarding the entry and release of several CoVs is summarized in Table 1.",
