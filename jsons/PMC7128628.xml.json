The aetiology of pneumonia has been widely investigated (Table 1\n), but so far no one has studied all of the most common childhood CAP causative agents. According to previous studies, up to two-thirds of childhood pneumonia cases are associated with viral infection [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are the most common viruses associated with pneumonia [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. With modern molecular diagnostic techniques, an increasing number of microorganisms can be detected, and recent aetiological studies have reported increasing detection rates for mixed viral\u2013bacterial infections in children with CAP [2, 3, 5, 6, 7].",

Pneumonia was defined as the presence of pneumonic infiltrates (alveolar or interstitial) on the chest radiograph with simultaneous signs and/or symptoms of acute infection. Sputum production was induced by inhalation of 5.0% hyper-tonic saline solution, and the sputum sample was obtained by aspirating through the nostrils (N = 69) or by expectoration if the child was old enough to produce an adequate sputum sample (N = 7). A good-quality sputum sample with <25 squamous epithelial cells and >25 leukocytes per low-power field was obtained from 76 of 133 children otherwise eligible for the study. The details of the sputum collection method and preliminary microbiological results have been described previously by Lahti et al. [9].",

We completed these viral studies to maximize the number and variety of viruses recovered from respiratory tract samples. Multiplex RT-PCR (Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used for the detection of 12 respiratory pathogens (AdV, influenza A and B viruses, RSV A and B, HMPV, PIV types 1, 2 and 3, RV A and B, and coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequence analysis was used for RV species determination as described elsewhere [11]. In addition, quantitative RT-PCRs detecting human parechoviruses, PIV4, influenza C virus, and quantitative PCR for AdV, were performed in separate assays. The assay for human parechovirus has been described in detail elsewhere [12]. The assays for PIV4, influenza C virus, and AdV are described in the Supporting Information.",

RV, either alone or in combination with other viruses or bacteria, was identified in one-third of the studied children. In previous studies, RV has been detected in 14\u201345% of children with pneumonia, suggesting a significant role for RV in childhood pneumonia [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Our detection rates for HBoV and HMPV were also in line with earlier studies. Recent studies have identified HMPV in 1\u201313% of children with pneumonia [3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14]. The role of HBoV as a causative agent of pneumonia is more difficult to assess, because, after a primary infection, HBoV may persist for a longer time than other respiratory viruses [15]. In a prospective study by Fry et al. [16], HBoV was detected in 12% of hospitalized children <5 years of age who had pneumonia. Moreover, HBoV was recently identified serologically in 12% of children with CAP in Italy [17]. Globally, RSV continues to be the major pneumonia causative virus [18]. In our study, RSV was detected at lower rates (7%) than reported by other investigators, (15\u201329%) [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14], but this can be explained by our study period being between two RSV epidemics.",

Some evidence suggests that mixed viral\u2013bacterial infections may potentially induce more severe disease than individual viral or bacterial infections [21, 22, 23]. Previously, mixed influenza virus\u2013S. aureus infection has been shown to be able to cause severe, fatal pneumonia in children [22, 23, 24, 25], and mixed RV\u2013S. pneumoniae infection has been shown to be associated with severe pneumonia in adults [26]. In children with invasive pneumococcal disease, viral co-infections are also common and are possibly associated with higher mortality [27]. Limited evidence suggests that viral co-infections may also induce more severe clinical illness than individual viral infections. Cilla et al. [4] have reported children with viral co-infections being hospitalized more frequently than those infected with a single virus. In addition, Esposito et al. [19] demonstrated that HBoV co-infections with other viruses were associated with greater disease burden (more hospitalizations and loss of school days) in children with respiratory tract infection than in those with HBoV infection alone. In our study, it is of interest that all children (8%) with treatment failure had evidence of mixed viral\u2013bacterial infection.",

The duration of the study period was short. Only the sputum samples with a high leukocyte count were included in this study. This may have influenced our results, especially in terms of viruses which may not induce leukocytes to the sputum. We did not use serology, which could have established infections caused by some viruses. It must be stressed that the detection of bacteria or viruses in the sputum sample does not necessarily mean that they are the causative agents of the concomitant lung infection. Bacteria might be contaminants from the nasopharynx, which, in healthy young children, often carries pathogenic bacteria. The detected virus might be found because of the concomitant upper respiratory tract infection. Furthermore, respiratory viruses, especially RV, have been detected in asymptomatic children (up to 60% in children <1 year of age) [28, 29], but prolonged shedding of RV is not known. Some respiratory viruses, such as HBoV and enteroviruses, may show prolonged shedding for months after acute infection [16]. Some bacteria, such as M. catarrhalis, are known to be less virulent and less likely to cause pneumonia [30]. Some respiratory DNA viruses, such as AdV, may be latent, and may be found by PCR but not be associated with the symptomatic infection. Thus, it is clear that the term \u2018causative agent\u2019 should be used with caution.",
