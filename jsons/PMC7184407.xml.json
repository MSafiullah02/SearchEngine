This notion was quickly picked up by the lay press and sparked concerns among physicians and patients regarding the intake of inhibitors of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infected individuals.1 In this article, we try to shed light on what is known and unknown regarding the RAAS and SARS-CoV2 interaction. We find translational evidence for diverse roles of the RAAS, which allows to formulate also the opposite hypothesis, i.e. that inhibition of the RAAS might be protective in COVID-19.",

In animal experiments, increased expression and activity of ACE2 in various organs including the heart were found in connection with ACE-I and ARB administration.6 In addition, more recent data showing increased urinary secretion of ACE2 in hypertensive patients treated with the ARB olmesartan suggest that up-regulation of ACE2 may also occur in humans.7 These observations have been reiterated in the literature and on the web in recent days and the question arose whether RAAS inhibition may increase the risk of deleterious outcome of COVID-19 through up-regulation of ACE2 and increase of viral load.",

Furthermore, ACE2 expression may not necessarily correlate with the degree of infection. Although ACE2 is thought to be mandatory for SARS-CoV infection, absence of SARS-CoV was observed in some ACE2 expressing cell types, whereas infection was present in cells apparently lacking ACE2, suggesting that additional co-factors might be needed for efficient cellular infection.8 In addition, lethal outcome of COVID-19 is mostly driven by the severity of the underlying lung injury. Importantly, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection and pulmonary disease, a key pathophysiological role was shown for ACE, angiotensin II and angiotensin II receptor type 1.9 SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV spike protein led to down-regulation of ACE2 and more severe lung injury in mice that could be attenuated by administration of an ARB9,10 These findings suggest a protective role of ARB in SARS-CoV associated lung injury and give rise to the hypothesis that primary activation of the RAAS in cardiovascular patients, rather than its inhibition, renders them more prone to a deleterious outcome.11",

Based on data from the China PEACE Million Persons Project, nearly half of Chinese adults between 35 and 75 years are suffering from hypertension, but fewer than one third receive treatment, and blood pressure control is achieved in less than 10%.12 Furthermore, there is thus far no data showing that hypertension or diabetes are independent predictors of fatal outcome. Therefore, based on currently available data and statistics, the assumption of a causal relationship between ACE-I or ARB intake and deleterious outcome in COVID-19 is not legitimate. In fact, in a case of reverse causality, patients taking ACE-Is or ARBs may be more susceptible for viral infection and have higher mortality because they are older, more frequently hypertensive, diabetic, and/or having renal disease.",

Similarly, a few animal and human studies suggest up-regulation of ACE2 in response to RAAS inhibition through a yet to be identified mechanism, but whether this increases viral load in a critical way, and how viral load per se relates to disease severity remains unknown. Nevertheless, based on the work by Josef Penninger et al.,13 who proposed to therapeutically use the dual function of ACE2 as viral receptor and gatekeeper of RAAS activation, a pilot trial using soluble human recombinant ACE2 (APN01) in patients with COVID-19 has recently been initiated (Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04287686).

Although there is currently no evidence, this could theoretically increase viral load and worsen outcome (red). In a reverse causality, ACE2 acts as a gatekeeper of the RAAS by degrading AngII to Ang1-7, hence diminishing its Ang II receptor 1-mediated deleterious effects. Therefore, ACE-I or ARB treatment could theoretically mitigate lung injury (green). Evidence for this mainly stems from animal studies.9,10 Providing soluble recombinant (r)ACE2 (blue) addresses both mechanisms by cell independent binding of SARS-CoV2 and degrading AngII to Ang 1-7.
