Single crown-like virion was directly visualized and quantitative measurements of the dimensions for the structural proteins were provided. A corona of large, distinctive spikes in the envelope was measured after treatment with hydroxyoctanoic acid. High-resolution images revealed that the surface of each single SARS-CoV was surrounded with at least 15 spherical spikes having a diameter of 7.29 \u00b1 0.73 nm, which is in close agreement with that of S glycoproteins earlier predicted through the genomes of SARS-CoV. This study represents the first direct characterization of the surface ultrastructures of SARS-CoV particles at the nanometre scale and offers new prospects for mapping viral surface properties.",

Five major open reading frames (ORFs) were determined through sequence similarity to known coronavirus proteins. This approach identify two replicases 1a and 1b that undergo cotranslational proteolytic processing and four structural proteins the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Holmes and Enjuanes, 2003) .

While optical microscopes are limited by diffraction ( l /2), AFM can achieve molecular and even atomic resolution for many materials (Butt et al ., 1993; Miura and Shukuya, 1993; Liu and Salmeron, 1994; Xu et al ., 1998) . In addition, three-dimensional information can be extracted directly from AFM topographic and phase images. These advantages force us to apply the AFM to the field of SARS-related virology. Here, we used AFM to determine the surface ultra structure of each single SARS-CoV virion and observe the surface characteristics and their topography and phase changes after treatments with hydroxyoctanoic acid or protease. This study provides a new approach to the measurements of components of SARS-CoV virions for future application in SARS proteomics.",

The profile displays that the measured heights of SARS-CoV particles are 71.7, 90.9 and 84.8 nm respectively. Over 30 single spherical particles were then examined, the surface traces are reproducible although some variations exist in the height of surface protrusions. The root mean square (RMS) value of heights of SARS-CoV particles calculated was approximately 81.2 \u00b1 10.6 nm. After average height for each viral particle are calculated, it is found that the RMS value of height (81.2 \u00b1 10.6 nm) corresponds with that (80-110 nm in diameter) obtained from a thin-section electron microscopy (Ksiazek et al ., 2003) .",

To further investigate the surface ultrastructure of a single SARS-CoV virion by AFM, we treated SARS-CoV samples with the surface-modifying chemical, hydroxyoctanoic acid (Fig. 2) . AFM images (scanning area 10 \u00a5 10 m m 2 ) of entire SARS-CoV after treatment are displayed in Fig Fig. 2A and A \u00a2 respectively. These higher-resolution images clearly reveal the presence of crown-like SARS-CoV virions and that each single virion with a partially intact or completely disrupted appearance is readily distinguishable. Each surface virion displayed in Fig. 2A was then profiled and their dimensions measured. It was found that, over 60 single particles were examined, the length, width and height of treated virions vary in a broad interval of 336-473 nm, 277-353 nm and 3.62-39.83 nm respectively.",

As shown in Fig. 2B \u00a2 , the phase image indicate the presence of some material (yellow, arrowheads in Fig. 2B \u00a2 ) surround the virus that was of a different composition than either the virion itself (brown) or the mica substrate (white). This may represent the chemicals (hydroxyoctanoic acid) interacted with the virions. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2C \u00a2 , many spheres (brown, arrowheads in Fig. 2C \u00a2 ) were liberated and dispersed near the virion itself. This might be attributed to the breakdown of viral envelope caused by hydroxyoctanoic acid. Hydroxyoctanoic acid is speculated to have unusual effects on the surface chemistry of viral envelope. Upon exposure to hydroxyoctanoic acid, the viral surface of SARS-CoV became more heterogeneous (Fig. 2 ) than the native virus ( Fig. 1) .",

When viruses were exposed to hydroxyoctanoic acid, the viral morphology was affected. As shown in Fig. 3B -E, SARS-CoV treated with hydroxyoctanoic acid displayed heterogeneous surface features. The native virion was broken down and a corona of large, distinctive protrusions surrounding the envelope are readily observed in Fig. 3B . The appearance of pits as shown in Fig. 3C -E indicates the release of viral components, predominately structural proteins such as spike (S) protein, membrane (M) proteins, small envelope (E) proteins or nucleocapsid (N) proteins, or non-structural proteins (such as replicase 1a and 1b) (Ksiazek et al ., 2003; Rota et al ., 2003; Marra et al ., 2003; Holmes and Enjuanes, 2003) . The new structure after treatment is not as tight as that of the native virion, which leads to liberation of the viral content ( Fig. 3B-E) . After treatment, intermolecular interactions among structural proteins (S, M or E proteins) within the envelope are weakened. Desorption of structural proteins occurs from the boundaries of the membrane patches, gradually leading to the release of some structural proteins. In addition, although the whole virions in some images ( Fig. 3B -E) appeared disrupted to some extent, some particles which initially surround the periphery are still visible in AFM images, as indicated by the cursor profiles ( Fig. 3 b-e ). Moreover, hydroxyoctanoic acid caused a substantial reduction in the surface height and irregularity in the viral surfaces. The particles indicated by the cursor profiles ( Fig. 3 b-e ) are probably larger structural proteins surrounding the viral periphery, such as spike proteins ( vide infra ). These regular structures are unlikely to be artifacts of either tip shape or immobilization procedure because they have been observed on at least 200 SARS-CoV virions which had been scanned in this work. The corresponding cursor profiles (Fig. 3 b-e ) provide quantitative measurements of the dimensions for the surface nanostructures. The profiles displayed in Fig. 3 b-e shows that the maximum height of particles measured are approximately 15. 25, 9.78, 7.72, 7 .19 nm respectively. As shown in Fig. 3B and C, each spherical protrusion on the cursor b or c was surrounded by other components in the envelope, while the spherical protrusion on cursor d and e in Fig. 3D and E, respectively, may be nearly regarded as an individual particle for further measurement. Over 30 such particles as displayed on the cursor d and e were examined, and although some variations exist in the exact height of such particles, the surface traces are reproducible. The calculated RMS value of heights of particles is 7.29 \u00b1 0.73 nm.",

The numbers of amino acids of six coronavirus proteins identified are 4382, 2628, 1255, 76, 221 and 422, respectively (Marra et al ., 2003) , and thus the molecular weights of proteins predicted are approximately 526, 315, 151, 9, 27 , and 51 kDa respectively. To investigate whether the spherical particles observed above are spike (S) proteins or other proteins in the viral envelope, immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules (mol. wt. 150 kDa) which have the same molecular weight with the spike protein (approximately 151 kDa) were prepared and scanned for AFM imaging under the same conditions with SARS-CoV sample. Multiple cross-sections of the individual IgG images by AFM were made and mean diameter and height of each single molecule were measured. After average height for each IgG molecule is calculated, it was found that the RMS value of heights for IgG molecules is approx- imately 7.13 \u00b1 0.13 nm (data not shown). This value is about consistent with the value (7.29 \u00b1 0.73 nm) obtained for spherical particles (Fig. 3) surrounding on the surface of SARS-CoV. Thus, the spherical particles visible on the viral surface are speculated to be possibly spike (S) proteins because of their size, 7.29 \u00b1 0.73 nm. For those SARS-CoV virions that maintain their crown-shaped morphology, the high-resolution images (500 \u00a5 500 m m) shown in Fig. 5 reveal that a corona of large, distinctive spikes surrounding the envelope of SARS-CoV. These spikes in the envelope makes possible the identification of coronaviruses by AFM. Figure 5 shows the two- (Fig. 5A ) and three-dimensional (Fig. 5B ) AFM images and their contour map (Fig. 5C ) of a single SARS-CoV virion. The corresponding cursor profiles (Fig. 5 a-f ) reveal couples of bumps and dents formed by the spikes proteins on the surface and also provide quantitative measurements of the dimensions for these spike proteins. It was found that from the contour map (Fig. 5C ) 15 spike proteins (arrowheads) surround the envelope of a single SARS-CoV virion. It is thus speculated that at least 15 spike proteins form the whole corona of a single SARS-CoV virion. In addition, as the virion displayed in Fig. 5A does not represents an intact one, the thickness of its corona surrounding the periphery ranges approximately from 13 to 17 nm (Fig. 5 a -f ), which basically corresponds to the dimension (20-to 30-nm) of the corona of SARS-CoV obtained previously from electron microscopic study (Ksiazek et al ., 2003) .",

As shown in Fig. 6 , after the intact virion was break down by chemical treatment, a number of small spherical particles (also see Fig. 2C\u00a2 , arrowheads) were released and readily observed from the height (Fig. 6A) and phase (Fig. 6B) image. The phase image provides a measure of sample heterogeneity and also indicates that the small spherical particles (arrowheads) come from the SARS-CoV virion itself (Fig. 6B) . The cursor profiles displayed in Fig 6a and  b can provide quantitative measurement of the dimension for each small spherical particle observed in Fig. 6A . Over 30 various small spherical particles liberated were then examined, the heights of small spherical particles ranges from 2.83 to 4.57 nm. The structural proteins of SARS-CoV have been reported to include spike (S) protein (mol. wt. 151 kDa), membrane (M) protein (mol. wt. 27 kDa), small envelope (E) protein (mol. wt. 9 kDa) and nucleocapsid (N) protein (mol. wt. 51 kDa) (Marra et al., 2003) . Although SARS-CoV also encode a number of non-structural proteins that are of unknown function and located between S, and E, between M and N, or downstream of N, molecular weights of these non-structural proteins are predicted to be less than 32 kDa. (Rota et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003) . Thus, various sizes of small spherical particles (2.83-4.57 nm) released when SARS-CoV broke down represents the different types of proteins of SARS-CoV reported previously. Therefore, the study reported here provides an approach to measurement of some components of a single SARS-CoV virion for future application in SARS proteomics-related studies.",

Whilst removing/avoiding impurities in sample preparation reduces the possibility of imaging third-party debris other methods are necessary to confirm the identification. Further work will concentrate on the use of antibodynanogold conjugates for the identification of SARS-CoV virion particles.",

AFM Tips were 200 mm long and had a typical resonant frequency of 140 kHz (Nanosensor, Wetzlar-Blankenfeld, Germany). Calibration of the AFM cantilever tip were carried out using a standard diffraction grating (Seiko Instruments, Chiba, Japan). Light tapping was used, which involved maintaining a high amplitude reference relative to the free amplitude of the cantilever. Typically, we began by scanning a 20 mm \u00a5 20 mm area that would contain hundreds of SARS-CoV virions. Gradually, the image size was reduced to isolate individual virion (500 nm \u00a5 500 nm). SARS-CoV specimen were scanned in both directions several times before capturing an image, to help ensure that tip artifacts, such as hysteresis, were not altering the images. Over 200 high-quality images were captured for each SARS-CoV virion, and a number of images were selected from these. Tips were replaced when there was any indication of artifacts present in the images. After images were collected, an offline section analysis was performed on each image in order to gain information on viral topography. When a line was drawn across the image, the topography of the sample as a function of distance was displayed. These height traces were performed to provide more information on how each treatment affected the surface topography. Roughness analyses were also performed on some samples, conducted according to the manufacturer's software program (SPI 3800N). The RMS average of the surface roughness value was calculated as the standard deviation of all the height values within the given area.",
