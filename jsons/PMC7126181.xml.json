In the search for an effective chemotherapeutic agent of HIV infections for targeting RT, initial attempts were focused on the development of 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxynucleosides (ddNs) and 2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxynucleosides (d4Ns).3, 4 Among them, the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs)5 such as 3\u2032-azido-3\u2032-deoxythymidine (AZT),6 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxyinosine (ddI),7 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxycytidine (ddC),8\nl-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy-3\u2032-thiacytidine (3TC)9 and 2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxythymidine (d4T)10 have been widely used to treat AIDS patients (Fig. 1\n).",

The lactone moiety of 6 might be more susceptible to hydrolysis than the ester, maybe due to the structural constraint caused by a fused cyclopropane ring. Treatment of 6 with 1 equiv of sodium hydroxide in EtOH afforded monocarboxylate sodium salt 6a, the ester of which was selectively reduced by sodium borohydride under reflux and then recyclized back to \u03b3-lactone 7 under acidic conditions. Protection of hydroxyl group of 7 with tert-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride produced silyl ether 8, which was reduced with Dibal-H at \u221278 \u00b0C to afford the corresponding lactol 9 in 97% yield. Wittig reaction of lactol 9 with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide afforded hydroxy olefin 10 in 88% yield after quenching with saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution. However, when the reaction mixture was partitioned between EtOAc and water without quenching with saturated NH4Cl aqueous solution after the Wittig reaction, a new by-product appeared at a higher R\nf value than that of the desired compound 10 in 10\u201320% yield. It turned out to be an acetylated compound 10a by 1H, 13C, COSY (Correlation spectroscopy) and HMBC (Heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) NMR experiments. The acetyl group might be derived from ethyl acetate used for extraction due to basic reaction conditions. Swern oxidation of 10 with oxalyl chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide at \u221278 \u00b0C smoothly proceeded to produce aldehyde 11, which was subjected to a Grignard reaction with vinylmagnesium bromide to afford allylic alcohols 12 (48%) and 13 (39%), easily separated by normal silica gel column chromatography. The stereochemistry of 12 and 13 was not determined until the corresponding bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenol scaffold was formed via a RCM (ring-closure metathesis) reaction in the next step. RCM reaction26 of dienes 12 and 13 with a second generation Grubbs catalyst produced the bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-en-2-ol analogs, (2R)-14 and (2S)-14, respectively. The stereochemistry of them was confirmed by comparing their 1H NMR spectra with that of the authentic enantio-counterpart, an enantiomer of (2S)-14, prepared from a chiral bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane template,27 indicating that the RCM product (2S)-14 derived from compound 13 has the desired (2S)-stereochemistry for a Mitsunobu reaction with nucleobases to yield various conformationally locked nucleosides. (2R)-14 can be also potential starting material for a palladium-mediated coupling reaction with nucleobases to produce the desired \u03b2-anomer.",

First, when tested in MT-4 (HTLV-1 and -2-infected human T lymphocyte) cells, among the final nucleosides thymine nucleoside analogs d-2 and l-2 showed the most potent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activity and their IC50 values against HIV-1 and -2 were 0.033 and 0.112 \u03bcg/mL for d-2, and 1.175 and 2.270 \u03bcg/mL for l-2, respectively (Table 1\n). The bigger difference in the two strains (IIIB and ROD) in the activity of d-2 than in that of l-2 reflects that l-nucleosides might fit almost equally at both the active sites of the two strains, whereas d-nucleosides might fit better at the active site for IIIB strain than that for ROD strain. Comparison of IC50 values of d-2 and l-2 against HIV-1 and -2 with those (2.31 and 2.76 \u03bcg/mL) of ddI, which is clinically used for the treatment of AIDS patients indicates that both thymine nucleosides d-2 and l-2 exhibit more potent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities than ddI used as a positive control. Although anti-HIV activity of d-2 exceeds that of l-2, l-2 (CC50 >100 \u03bcg mL\u22121) is less cytotoxic than d-2 (CC50\n = 8.558 \u03bcg mL\u22121), which corresponds to the fact that l-nucleosides have been generally known to be less toxic than d-counterpart. Selective indexes (CC50/EC50) toward HIV-1 and -2 showed 263 and 76, respectively, for d-2 and more than 85.09 and more than 44.05, respectively, for l-2. d-Adenine nucleoside, d-4 exhibited weak anti-HIV-1 activity (IC50\n = 40.47 \u03bcg mL\u22121) but does not show anti-HIV-2 activity. d-Cytosine nucleoside, d-3 showed cytotoxicity-derived anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities. The other nucleoside derivatives showed neither anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities nor cytotoxicity. According to the literature,16a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl nucleosides with no double bond showed no or weak anti-HIV activity, indicating that the internal double bond is essential for high anti-HIV activity. Other antiviral effects for the final nucleoside derivatives were evaluated against coxsackie B1 and B3 viruses, and poliovirus 3. However, all nucleosides neither exhibited antiviral activities nor cytotoxicity up to 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121. The final nucleosides belong to 2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxynucleosides whereas coxsakie viruses and poliovirus belong to RNA viruses. This point might result in lack of antiviral activities against coxsakie viruses and poliovirus. Antiviral evaluation against HSV-1 and -2 was conducted and only l-thymine nucleoside, l-2 showed weak anti-HSV-2 activity (IC50\n = 59.23 \u03bcg mL\u22121) without discernible cytotoxicity. Antiviral inhibition of l-thymine nucleoside, l-2 was also performed against FluA (influenza virus type A) (H1N1) strain Taiwan, FluA (H3N2) strain Johannesburg, FluB (influenza virus type B) strain Panama, FCV (feline coronavirus) strain WSU, and FIP (feline infectious peritonitis virus) strain WSU, but it neither showed antiviral activity nor cytotoxicity up to 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 (not shown), maybe because both influenza and corona viruses are viruses with a RNA genome. All l-nucleosides did not show any cytotoxicity up to 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 in all cell lines tested.",

It is interesting to note that all l-nucleosides did not show cytotoxicity up to 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 in all cells tested. Probably, the low cytotoxicity of l-nucleosides may be closely associated with a l-type, an unnatural type.

The compounds were tested and compared to ddI and ddC obtained from Sigma for cytotoxicity and for their ability to inhibit HIV replication. The compounds were first dissolved in 100% DMSO and then diluted with RPMI-1640/10% FBS just before use. The maximum final concentration of DMSO added to the cell cultures was 0.5% at the highest concentration of the compound. We have determined that at that concentration DMSO does not interfere with cell growth.
