Acute respiratory complications are also common after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), accounting for a high proportion of HSCT-related morbidity and mortality [2] [3] [4] . When pulmonary disease in HSCT patients progresses to acute respiratory failure, they often require emergent intubation and support with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) [3, 5]; many children develop refractory hypoxemia and multi-organ failure. Tamburro et al. reported outcomes in a cohort of mechanically ventilated pediatric oncology and HSCT patients. The non-HSCT patients had better outcomes than the HSCT patients with 6-month survival at 60% [6] . While the outcomes are better in the oncology patients, they are nevertheless worse than immunocompetent patients. Their immunocompromised status and chemotherapy-related multi-organ failure are likely complicating factors affecting outcomes in this cohort.",

Oncology and HSCT patients should be closely monitored for development of pediatric ARDS (PARDS), with stratification of severity of illness to allow early and appropriate escalation of respiratory support. In 2015, the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) guidelines defined PARDS and stratified severity [10] using the following definition: Lung injury in the pediatric oncology patients is related to their immunocompromised status and direct pulmonary toxicity from chemotherapy and/or radiation. Chemotherapeutic agents most commonly implicated in lung injury include bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, nitrosureas, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, methotrexate, procarbazine, mitomycin, cytarabine, vinca alkaloids, and alkylating agents such as busulfan [11] . Of these, bleomycin, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and the nitrosureas are most commonly implicated in pediatric patients [11, 12] . Toxicity from radiation therapy is dose dependent with patients receiving fractionated doses having less risk for toxicity than patients receiving the same total dose given at one time. Patients typically develop symptoms within 1-3 months of receiving radiation therapy and present with cough, dyspnea, and pink-tinged sputum during the inflammatory phase. This can progress to the fibrotic stage which progresses over 1-2 years. Patients in this phase develop increasing dyspnea, oxygen requirement, and declining pulmonary function tests.",

Patients typically respond well to stopping the medication and administration of steroids. Endothelial injury and vascular leak causing noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is another early pulmonary toxicity seen from drugs such as methotrexate, cytarabine, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, IL-2, ATRA (all trans-retinoic acid), and bleomycin. Both types of early toxicity respond well to supportive care and have a relatively good prognosis. Later pulmonary toxicity occurring several months to years after receiving the chemotherapeutic agent leads to fibrotic lung injury and has a much worse prognosis [11] . If patients respond to steroids, weaning of steroids should occur slowly and cautiously as it can reactivate the underlying disease process.",

            "text": "Noninfectious complications after HSCT are often treated with immune suppression. Therefore, the first step in management of a HSCT patient with acute hypoxia and/or hypercarbia is to perform a thorough workup to confirm or rule out infectious etiologies (Table 11 .1). These children are at high risk of death if their infection is not identified early and treated and their immune dysregulation appropriately addressed. Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections are all considerations in posttransplant patients given their immunosuppression and presence of indwelling catheters and invasive lines. Identification of specific organism can help clinicians target antimicrobial therapy. Unfortunately, broad-spectrum empiric treatment is often prolonged due to delays in turnaround times and insensitivity of microbiological testing. It is thought that a BAL should be strongly considered in patients with diffuse lung injury posttransplant [3] . However, it is prudent to consider the risk-benefit ratio and optimal timing of the BAL due to the potential for worsening lung mechanics. Triebwasser et al. in 2018 in a retrospective chart review of 593 patients of different age groups that underwent a BAL reported identification of pathogens in 30% of cases [15] . They reported that the BAL led to changes in patient management in 55% of cases, including alteration in antibiotics (37%) and immunosuppression (25%). BAL complications included hypoxemia (1%), hemorrhage (2%), and respiratory failure (1%) in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation prior to the BAL. This would suggest that an early BAL would be safe and may alter the treatment plan in more than half of cases. Prophylaxis and preemptive screening for invasive fungal and CMV infections have resulted in a decrease in their incidence posttransplant [3] . Improved molecular diagnostic techniques will likely result in improved testing yield and decreased need for prolonged empiric therapy.",

In 1993 a National Institutes of Health workshop defined IPS as widespread alveolar injury in the absence of active lower respiratory infection, cardiogenic causes, renal failure, or iatrogenic fluid overload after HSCT [3, 16] . This definition was further classified based on anatomy as interstitial, vascular, airway tissue, or unclassifiable [3, 14] . T-cell-mediated injury is supported as the primary pathophysiology by murine models. TNF-\u03b1 levels have been shown to be increased in the BAL fluid of mice with IPS. This is supported by the clinical observation that patients who receive T-cell-depleted grafts have a lower incidence of pulmonary complications [13] . However other TNF-\u03b1-independent pathways may also contribute to the pathophysiology of IPS [3] . Given the TNF-\u03b1 pathway-mediated injury, the soluble TNF-\u03b1-binding protein, etanercept, has been tested in a trial for treatment of IPS [17] . Early recognition of the disorder, ruling out other infectious etiologies, and initiation of corticosteroids along with other anti-inflammatory targeted therapies may improve outcomes after IPS [3] .",

Histology reveals intraluminal organizing fibrosis in distal airspaces with mild interstitial inflammation [3] . Both BOS and COP are related to T-cell-mediated injury to lung epithelial cells, and Initial therapy is usually high-dose corticosteroids burst with a prolonged taper over months [3, 13] . Other therapies such as azithromycin, cyclosporine, and etanercept have been described and need further evaluation [3, 13] .

This is well known in patients with mediastinal masses impinging on great vessels or large pericardial effusions. Maintaining spontaneous ventilation, using specialized equipment (fiber-optic bronchoscope), avoiding the use of paralytics, and having extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) equipment on standby are important considerations [13] . This transition can also result in cardiopulmonary collapse in patients with right heart failure and in patients who are intravascularly depleted such as patients in septic shock or hypovolemic shock. The former may be seen due to cardiac toxicity from chemotherapy and/or radiation or from pulmonary hypertension. Optimization of intravascular volume, use of inotropes to augment ventricular function, and availability of inhaled nitric oxide to avert a pulmonary hypertensive crisis might help prevent the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation during this transition.",

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) maintains positive pressure and prevents airway and alveolar collapse in patients who are spontaneously breathing [38] . BiPAP is triggered by the patient's breath and an inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) is provided while preventing airway and alveolar collapse with expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) [36] [37] [38] .

NIV has been shown in some adult studies to reduce intubation rates, shorten ICU length of stay, and reduce the cost of hospitalization [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . A metaanalysis by Wang et al. [45] looked at NIV versus IMV in all immunocompromised patients; the ICU length of stay was significantly shorter in the NIV group. This was however in patients with lower severity of illness scores [45] . Additionally, this group found a significant decrease in hospital mortality in NIV groups compared to IMV groups though there was high degree of heterogeneity. Within the hematologic and solid tumors subgroups, the 30-day mortality was significantly reduced with OR 0.34 (95% CI 0.22-0.54) when NIV was compared to IMV [45, 46] . Similarly, in a retrospective review of immunocompromised pediatric patients receiving NIV, Pancera et al. found that in the NIV group, there was a higher prob-ability of 30-day survival (46.8%) when compared to the IMV (23.3%) [37] . However, more patients in the IMV group had markers of higher illness severity as evidenced by more than two organ failure, cardiovascular dysfunction, and therapeutic interventions scoring system score of \u226540.",

Literature reports a NIV success rate in immunocompromised pediatric patients of 54.5% with diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome and up to 74.2% with diagnosis of respiratory failure [37, 47] . Among all patients with acute respiratory failure who received NIV, FiO 2 > 80% 1 h after initiation predicted failure of NIV [48] . Within pediatric immunocompromised patients, those who failed NIV were more likely to have severe sepsis and septic shock than those in the success group [47] . Patients in the NIV success group had early and sustained improvement compared to those who failed; therefore, lack of early improvement is discussed with the threshold of improvement being between 1 h and 2-4 h [47] [48] [49] [50] . Munoz-Bonet et al. determined that an improvement in respiratory rate and pCO 2 2-4 h after NIV was associated with NIV success. Patients who had improvement of their PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio within the first hour of NIV initiation also were more likely to be in the NIV success group [49] . Therefore, a lack of improvement in physiologic parameters, such as weaning FiO2 or decreasing respiratory rate, within 2-4 h of NIV initiation should be considered an indication for endotracheal intubation (Fig. 11.1 ) [36] . Additionally, it appears prudent to consider patients with escalating hemodynamic support to have failed NIV trial.",

Thereby, if one is not able to achieve lung recruitment without utilization of high ventilation strategies, one should consider escalation to other nonconventional modalities that are considered lung protective [10] . Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is another modality that has been used by some centers. Rowan et al. in a retrospective multicenter database study reported on 85 pediatric HSCT patients with severe PARDS managed with HFOV. The study suggested that in that cohort, early use of HFOV was associated with improved survival compared to late implementation of HFOV, and the subjects had outcomes similar to those treated only with conventional mechanical ventilation [57] . There continues to be a need for more outcome data with HFOV and APRV use in pediatric patients with respiratory failure. Yehya et al. in a cohort of pediatric patients, refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation requiring transition to HFOV or APRV, demonstrated that HFOV was associated with more frequent neuromuscular blockade with no difference in mortality [56] . Perhaps more important is to observe the improvement in OI at 6-24 h after transition to HFOV and APRV which has been associated with survival, likely reflecting severity of lung disease and/or the ability to re-recruit the lungs [54, 56, 58] . In conclusion, lung protective ventilation should be implemented early in this cohort of children given the high risk of mortality and morbidity.",

Establishing set criteria for ECMO cannulation in this population is challenging given their immunocompromised status, thrombocytopenia, unique/varying range of pathologies, and multi-organ dysfunction. Gow et al. in 2006 reported a 21% survival rate to decannulation in a small cohort of 19 pediatric HSCT patients [60] . Renal complications and multi-organ dysfunction were reported to be risk factors for death. It thereby appears prudent to make the decision regarding cannulation by utilizing a multidisciplinary approach early in the disease process, to determine candidacy and timing of cannulation and allow serial evaluation.

Tight fluid management is imperative along with initiation of diuretics in many patients. Clinical orders to limit total fluids at maintenance, to concentrate all medications and infusions, and to evaluate the need for medications that have a high volume of fluid should be done early to avoid worsening fluid overload. Acute renal failure is not an uncommon complication in posttransplant patients, and it makes fluid management extremely challenging. Fluid overload associated with acute renal failure leads to worsening respiratory function, prolonged ventilation, increased ICU stay, and mortality [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . Early consultation of renal specialists and intervention with diuretics and advanced therapies for fluid removal is imperative. In a retrospective chart review of 113 critically ill pediatric patients receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, median fluid overload percentage was significantly lower in survivors versus non-survivors (7.8% vs. 15.1%) [65] . Michael et al. reviewed 26 HSCT patients with acute renal failure and noted a fluid overload of <10% was associated with improved survival [66] . Ellbahlawan et al. demonstrated a significant improvement in the PaO2/ FiO2 ratio in HSCT patients after initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy, which significantly correlated, with reduction of fluid balance [67] .

            "text": "Immunocompromised oncology patients, including HSCT patients are a unique patient population with unique pathologies and other organ dysfunction leading to respiratory failure. Evaluation of a HSCT patient with acute hypoxia and/or hypercarbia requires a workup to confirm or rule out infectious etiologies prior to treatment for potential noninfectious causes. Utilization of NIV requires constant monitoring of the patient to ensure improvement. The lack of physiological improvement on NIV should be considered an indication for endotracheal intubation. Early and aggressive lung protective ventilation strategies upon intubation with close monitoring for fluid overload may result in improved outcomes in these patients. Further research is required to look at other modifiable clinical factors/management techniques and to assess outcomes after the use of NIV, IMV, and ECMO in this unique population.",
