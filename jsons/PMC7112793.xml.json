Initial infection with TGEV occurs at the intestinal mucosal epithelium, and so local intestinal immunity plays an important role in the prevention of TGEV infection (Tuboly et al., 2000). Traditional parenteral vaccination with virulent or attenuated virus does not induce sufficient mucosal immunity in the intestinal tract (Gu et al., 2012). Oral vaccination, a promising alternative, elicits strong local and systemic immune responses (Otczyk and Cripps, 2010), which have been shown to block viral attachment and colonization, and prevent localized infections of the intestinal tract (Otczyk and Cripps, 2010). However, few reports regarding the oral immunization of large animals have been published (Cox et al., 2002).",

            "text": "The inactivated vaccine has excellent safety and tolerance profiles (Beyer et al., 2002, Cox et al., 2004) with few adverse reactions reported. However, oral immunization with inactivated virus does not result in effective immune protection (Petrovsky and Aguilar, 2004, Scheerlinck et al., 2006). Thus, the immune response to inactivated virus needs to be enhanced. CpG DNA, as an adjuvant, can induce Th1-like cytokine responses by stimulating antigen-presenting cells via toll-like receptors (McCluskie and Krieg, 2006, Zhang et al., 2007b). CpG DNA as a mucosal adjuvant elicits a strong immune response in mice following intranasal immunization (McCluskie and Davis, 1999, McCluskie et al., 2000). Our previous study suggested that CpG DNA could markedly enhance the mucosal and systemic immune responses to inactivated H9N2 avian influenza viruses when administered to ducks (Kang et al., 2012, Kang et al., 2013). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether CpG DNA could improve the efficiency of oral immunization with inactivated TGEV and so prevent the development of TGE.",

However, the use of synthetic CpG-ODN is limited, particularly in the animal industry, by its high cost (Kang et al., 2013). Natural CpG DNA exhibited immunostimulatory activities similar to that of synthetic CpG-ODN (McCluskie et al., 2000). Moreover, large-scale production of natural CpG DNA is less expensive (Li et al., 2012). In this study, we evaluated the immune-stimulatory activity of natural CpG DNA using porcine splenic lymphocytes. Consistent with the report by Kamstrup, we found that CpG stimulation induced a significant increase in PBMC proliferation (Kamstrup et al., 2001). Several works have suggested that CpG DNA exerts a number of effects on pigs (Kamstrup et al., 2001, Yang and Parkhouse, 1996, Zhang et al., 2007a). In vivo animal experiments were performed to further evaluate the immune-stimulatory effects of CpG DNA on local immunity in pigs.",

Our findings demonstrated that the local Th1 cytokines IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 were induced early after immunization. These results agree with those obtained in other animal models where CpG preferentially induced Th1 responses due to activation of DCs and secretion of IL-12 (Chu et al., 1997, Zimmermann et al., 1998). Moreover, IL-6 levels increased after oral immunization with ITGEV and CpG, either together or separately. IL-6 induces the maturation and activation of B cells, which increases the secretion of antigen-specific IgA (Burdin et al., 1995, Neurath and Finotto, 2011).

The presence of TGEV-specific sIgA in the colostrum and milk of sows provides effective protection to new-born piglets. However, infection can still occur after the cessation of breast feeding (Gu et al., 2012). In contrast, parenteral immunization with inactivated TGEV seldom resulted in the generation of neutralizing antibody in the small intestine (VanCott et al., 1994). Previous studies have reported enhanced local mucosal immunity after immunization with CpG DNA (Zanvit et al., 2005). In this study, oral immunization resulted in a high level of TGEV-specific sIgA in feces, likely due to administration of CpG DNA (Kovacs-Nolan et al., 2009). This result is similar to that obtained with intranasal immunizations with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus together with a porcine-specific CpG (Zhang et al., 2007b). Interestingly, sIgA levels in feces peaked at week 2 and decreased gradually thereafter. Thus, improvement of oral vaccine dosage forms may be an effective strategy to enhance the sustained release of antigens. We found that sIgA levels in feces decreased over time while TGEV-specific IgA levels in the ileum remained high up to week 6. This indicated that sIgA levels in feces were not correlated with those in other tissues.",
