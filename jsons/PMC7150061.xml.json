The degree of virulence depends on invasiveness (the capacity of the organism to spread widely through the body) and toxigenicity (the toxin-producing property of the organism) (see Ch. 13). A further variable is the dose of the organism, as well as virulence. A small number of organisms of high virulence is usually sufficient to cause disease in a susceptible person, whereas if the organism is of low virulence it often fails to cause disease. Another variable is the portal of entry. Many organisms have a predilection for a particular tissue or organ. For example, the causal organism of typhoid fever, Salmonella typhi, usually causes disease only when it enters the human body through the mouth in food or water (see Ch. 24).",

This type of outbreak is also frequently termed a common source outbreak or a point source outbreak. This pattern of infection is often discovered when water or food becomes contaminated, although other vehicles of infection can also be responsible for this type of outbreak.2\nPerson-to-person spread. Outbreaks caused by infections that are spread from person to person usually have a more protracted course, taking longer than explosive outbreaks to build up and to subside. An infective agent may be passed from person to person by a variety of routes. Diseases such as dysentery, hepatitis type A and gastroenteritis, which are usually spread by the faecal\u2013oral route, often follow this pattern of spread (Fig. 68.4\n).3\nExplosive outbreaks with subsequent person-to-person spread. This pattern is often apparent when there is contamination of a common water or food source and the initial cases subsequently infect their contacts. Thus, the pattern of the outbreak is a combination of that seen with an explosive outbreak, but followed by a slower decline (Fig. 68.5\n).\n",

In a community outbreak of legionnaires\u2019 disease were those affected living downwind from a source of infection (Fig. 68.6\n)?3\nWHEN did the infection occur? By knowing the incubation period of the infection and the date of onset of symptoms, it may be possible to trace back to an event that was attended by all those affected.4\nWHAT was the common factor? For example, in a food poisoning episode, the ingestion of an article of food by most of those affected but not by those unaffected may be a vital piece of evidence.5\nHOW did those involved become infected?

Such an approach might have the following as a basis:1\nVerify the diagnosis. It is always prudent to confirm that the clinical history is compatible with the diagnosis. Occasional \u2018pseudo-epidemics\u2019 can occur, sometimes resulting from contamination of specimens.2\nEstablish the existence of an outbreak. The increased interest of an investigator or a change in the mechanism of reporting can sometimes result in an increase in the number of reports of illness. It is important to check the previous level of investigation of a clinical entity or alteration in laboratory methods.3\nEstablish the extent of an outbreak. Often the number of cases notified is only a proportion of the total number of those affected. It is necessary to seek out the additional cases or vital information may be lost.4\nIdentify common characteristics or experiences of the affected persons. An individual history from each confirmed or suspected case is required to detect any common factor among those affected (e.g. eating the same item of food).5\nInvestigate the source and vehicle of infection. In addition to ascertaining the general characteristics of the material suspected as being the source or vehicle of infection, appropriate laboratory investigation will often have to be done. Good co-operation with laboratory staff is vitally important. Increasingly, putative links between individuals who present with the same infection or infectious disease are confirmed or dispelled through the typing or sequencing of the genes of the organism involved.6\nAnalyse the findings. The data should be analysed by various epidemiological criteria, especially persons, time and place. Denominators should be obtained to calculate attack rates.7\nConstruct and test a hypothesis. On the basis of the evidence a hypothesis should be constructed concerning the origin of the outbreak. This may be confirmed by laboratory findings but action to control the outbreak may be needed in advance. The hypothesis may be tested by comparing information from cases with matched controls (case/control study).\n",

For this purpose it is more appropriate to consider the following factors, suggested by the medical statistician Bradford Hill, to establish whether a disease is caused by a particular infectious agent:1\nStrength. What is the strength of the association? During the cholera epidemic in London in 1854, John Snow compared the death rates among persons drinking the sewage-polluted drinking water of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company with those receiving the purer water of the Lambeth Company; he discovered that the rate in the former was 14 times greater (Table 68.2\n). This strength of association allowed Snow to consider that polluted water was a cause of cholera, although at that time the causative organism itself had not been identified.2\nConsistency. Similar observations, made by different people at different times in different places, add confidence to a conclusion that causation is likely.3\nSpecificity. If the association is limited to a specific group of persons, with a specific type of illness, who have all been subjected to the same specific infection, then a cause-and-effect relationship can be more strongly suspected.4\nTemporality. This can be of especial importance when persons in particular occupations become infected (e.g. leptospirosis in sewerworkers). The history of working in a particular environment before infection rather than vice versa is particularly relevant.5\nBiological gradient. If a dose\u2013response curve is apparent then the evidence for causation is much stronger.6\nPlausibility. Is the possibility biologically plausible? The likelihood of veterinary surgeons becoming ill with a zoonotic infection from affected cattle which they have recently been treating seems biologically plausible.7\nCoherence. If all the evidence is coherent (e.g. if the same micro-organism is isolated from the index case, the vehicle of transmission and from the victims), this is strong support for causation.8\nExperiment. Is the frequency of infection reduced if certain preventive measures are taken? The beneficial effects of the pasteurization of milk to diminish the number of cases of milk-borne salmonellosis is presumptive evidence of a zoonotic relationship.9\nAnalogy. Has there been similar evidence in the past? The known capacity of the rubella virus to cause congenital abnormalities in the infants of infected mothers makes it easier to accept the possibility of other viruses causing similar problems if maternal infection occurs.\n",
