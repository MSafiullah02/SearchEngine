His findings were likely due to severe malnutrition secondary to parental neglect. Resuscitation with dextrose containing intravenous fluids was promptly started. On day 2 of admission, refeeding was initiated. From that time, he had multiple hypoglycemic episodes along with hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia. Hypoglycemia was associated with the initiation of enteral feeding and an increase in calories and amounts of enteral feeding. Hypoglycemia associated with refeeding syndrome in infant has not been previously reported.",

It is caused by increased serum insulin level with refeeding followed by an intracellular shift of glucose, potassium, magnesium, and phosphate [2] . Clinical manifestations usually include hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and thiamine deficiency [3] . Hyperglycemia is a common associated finding and is explained by insufficient insulin supply at initial feeding [4] . Postparandial hypoglycemia associated with refeeding is reported in some cases with eating disorders [5] . However, hypoglycemia has not been previously reported in infants.",

When EMS arrived, the patient was found to have bradycardia, bradypnea with desaturation, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia with a blood sugar undetectable by glucometer. The patient was intubated, warmed, given atropine, and started on intravenous fluids with glucose immediately. On arrival to the hospital, blood pressure was 81/45 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats per min, temperature was 36.6 while on warmer, and SpO 2 was 100% on ventilator with FiO 2 0.4. On physical exam, he was severely malnourished with height and weight of 58 cm (<1 percentile for his age) and 3.5 kg (<1 percentile for his age), respectively. Laboratories were sent for genetic, metabolic, and endocrine disorders, which were all unremarkable; no hyperinsulinism in critical samples, no urinary ketones, normal lactate levels, normal serum uric acid level, and normal lipid profile. Patient's severe malnourishment was likely due to inadequate oral intake secondary to parental neglect.",

Initially, his estimated energy needs for catch up were calculated as 178 kcal/kg/d and 3.3 g/kg/d of protein, using his current weight of 3.5 kg and ideal body weight for his age of 7.6 kg. His feeding was started with 13% of his estimated energy needs and was increased by 10% each day. On day 3 of admission, his serum levels of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus started to decrease gradually (Fig. 1a-c) . Depleted electrolytes were replaced as needed. In addition, IV fluids were started with glucose infusion rate (GIR) of 7.1 on day 1 of admission for hypoglycemia but needed to be increased to 11.7 for multiple hypoglycemic episodes on day 3 of admission. Higher GIR through IV was required to maintain serum blood sugar level when enteral feeding was initiated and when the calories and amounts of enteral feeding were increased. During the period when feeding regimen was unchanged, GIR requirement decreased. On day 15, continuous tube feeding was switched to bolus feeding which again caused hypoglycemic episodes (Fig. 1d) . IV glucose infusion was safely weaned and discontinued on day 30 of admission.",

Additionally, on day 3, multiple hypoglycemic episodes occurred with electrolyte disturbances which required electrolyte correction, several IV glucose boluses, and increased glucose infusion rate. The initiation of enteral feeding with a lower dose than 20-75% of estimated caloric needs could not prevent refeeding syndrome in this case.",
