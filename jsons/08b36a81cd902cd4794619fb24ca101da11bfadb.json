Numbers of sequence reads generated per run has progressively increased with time, due to improved understanding of molecular biology as well as technological advances. Current sequencing platforms are capable of generating enormous numbers of sequence reads in quick turnaround time, allowing researchers to explore all possible aspects of biomedical studies at molecular level and dig deeper in the genetic aspects. NGS has proven to be an efficient, fast and reliable approach to solve problems in studies of evolution, ecology and genetics, overcoming the limitation of traditional molecular approaches [22] . Another great advantage of NGS approach over traditional molecular studies is that it is also cost efficient. End-to-end human genome can be sequenced in few hours using NGS technology, whereas, it took over a decade to sequence and assemble human genome using Sanger Sequencing. Based upon the chemistry, a number of NGS platforms have been developed since last decade. Bioinformatics knowledge plays an important role in assembling the fragments sequenced in parallel by mapping all the read sequences to the human genome reference. Depth of the sequencing, i.e. number of times the template has been sequenced, assures accuracy of sequencing, making sure that observed variation in sequenced data is the result of mutations, and not of sequencing errors. NGS can be used to sequence targeted regions identified in a genetic study, or entire genome including all coding genes (whole exome sequencing). The variations in human genome can be a few nucleotide base changes (substitutions), insertions, and deletions of DNA, large genomic deletions of exons or whole genes and rearrangements such as inversions and translocations. All these anomalies are collectively termed 'mutations'. Traditional methods of sequencing were only able to discover handfuls of mutations including small insertions and deletions. This led to the development of dedicated assays, to discover additional types of variations. Some of the examples includes fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for conventional karyotyping, or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarrays to detect sub-microscopic chromosomal copy number changes such as microdeletions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 719, "end": 723, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SVM Applications Based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Data"}, {"text": "With recent advancements in NGS technologies and better understanding of life at genomic level, various questions have been answered using whole genome sequencing.

Many PPIs are involved between virus and host during a viral infection where the virus proteins take over the host transcriptional machinery [78] . It has been believed that viral proteins bind to the host protein that are highly connected [81] . Endogenous interface, with respect to virus-host systems, are responsible for interactions in their own system i.e. host-host PPI and virus-virus PPI. On the other hand, exogenous interfaces are responsible of virus-host interactions. Both virus and host compete for endogenous and exogenous interfaces [81] . Mutations at protein interfaces can reduce or increase their binding affinities by changing protein electrostatics and structural properties. Virus and host proteins change their surface However, host tends to be less variable than viruses. Viruses diversify through various modes of molecular evolution, including conservation, horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication and molecular mimicry [81] . Viral proteins constantly inhibit hosthost interactions and therefore, blocking such interactions between virus & host can aid in biomedical applications by identification of drug targets and developing antiviral therapies [81] . For e.g. a drug, Maraviroc, binds the cellular co-receptor CCR5, a receptor on white blood cells involved in immune system, preventing it from interacting with GP120 of HIV1 which is essential for entry of HIV-1 in host [82] . As viruses pose a global threat, understanding of virus & human PPIs can help in development of vaccines for treatment. Comprehensive PPI networks have been generated using experimental methods. These experimental methods employ different techniques like tandem affinity purification, affinity chromatography, coimmunoprecipitation, protein arrays, protein fragment complementation, phage display, X-ray crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy [79] . However, due to the huge PPI data and the time consuming experimental methods, computational methods are increasingly becoming popular to analyse the PPI networks and find out the functions of unexplored proteins.
