            "text": "The phylum Nematoda (roundworms) includes many parasites that are of major socio-economic importance. For example, grazing ruminants are frequently parasitized by multiple species of the order Strongylida, which can cause significant disease, known as parasitic gastroenteritis (PGE) (Kassai, 1999). Different species of strongylid nematodes can vary considerably in their pathogenicity, geographical distribution and susceptibility to anthelmintic drugs (Dobson et al., 1996). Mixed infections, involving multiple genera and species are common, and usually have a greater impact on the host than monospecific infections. Furthermore, the species composition of the parasites present in a host animal plays an important role in the severity of infection (Wimmer et al., 2004). Depending on the number, species and burden of parasitic nematodes, common symptoms of PGE include reduced weight gain or weight loss, anorexia, diarrhoea, reduced production and, in the case of blood-feeding species, anaemia and oedema, due to the loss of blood and/or plasma proteins (Kassai, 1999). Therefore, the knowledge of the nematode species present in a particular geographical area, their biology and epidemiology have important implications for the control of parasitism, particularly given the increasing problems of drug resistance in strongylid nematodes of livestock (Kaplan, 2004, Sangster, 1999, Wolstenholme et al., 2004).",

In particular, in the case of mixed infections, the specific detection and identification of parasites (and specific diagnosis of infection) can be laborious and time consuming using conventional methods, such as faecal egg counts (FECs) or larval culture (LC) and differentiation (Wimmer et al., 2004). Molecular techniques that rely on the amplification of nucleic acids, particularly those coupled to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Saiki et al., 1988), are effective for the specific identification of parasites, and aid the diagnosis of infections from minute amounts of target template, if suitable markers are utilized. Such methods are likely to provide powerful alternative tools to traditional approaches, to underpin fundamental research into parasite epidemiology and to improve the control of parasitic disease (Gasser, 2006).",

Furthermore, published data have been based largely on the use of traditional diagnostic approaches, and no detailed epidemiological investigations of gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep have been conducted using molecular tools.",

            "text": "The livestock industry plays a major role in the economies of many developed and developing countries. The production of livestock animals provides food, animal products (e.g. leather, hides and wool), income, employment, a source of organic fertilizer and biogas as well as draught and work power (particularly important in developing countries in which modern machinery is not affordable or available). Globally, parasite infections are associated with significant economic losses to the livestock industry (Vercruysse and Claerebout, 2001). For example, nematode infections of sheep were estimated, in 2006, to cost the Australian grazing industry 369 million dollars per annum, making these parasites one of the greatest constraints on the Australian grazing industry (McLeod, 1995, Sackett and Holmes, 2006). The economic impact of parasitic diseases differs between the developed and developing worlds. In the developing world, the greatest impact of parasitic diseases relates to direct productivity losses and lost socio-economic potential. In the developed world, on the other hand, the main impact is in the costs of control (Hawkins, 1993, Perry and Randolph, 1999) associated with the use of anthelmintics, strategic anthelmintic programmes and improved pasture utilization, which all limit the impact of parasitism at the subclinical or economical levels (Corwin, 1997). How the economic impact of parasitism should be assessed, in order to aid decisions in disease control, is a topic of debate and has been reviewed in detail (Hawkins, 1993, Perry and Randolph, 1999).",

            "text": "Whilst lungworms, such as species of Dictyocaulus, Protostrongylus or Muellerius, are economically important, gastrointestinal nematodes that parasitize the abomasum, small and large intestines of ruminants are also responsible for major losses to the livestock industries (Hawkins, 1993, McLeod, 1995). Strongylid nematodes of the superfamily Trichostrongyloidea, including species of Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Teladorsagia, Trichostrongylus, and, to lesser extent, Nematodirus spp. are regarded to be of great importance, particularly in small ruminants (Berghen et al., 1993, Zajac, 2006). Other important gastrointestinal nematodes include species of Oesophagostomum, Chabertia and the bovine hookworm, Bunostomum, of which the latter two genera are regarded to be less common (Zajac, 2006). Usually, low intensities of infection do not cause a serious hazard to the health of livestock animals and may be tolerated (i.e. allowing the development of some immunity in the host), but as the numbers of worms increase, subclinical disease can manifest itself by signs of reduced appetite, weight gain, wool production and fertility, and is, therefore, of great economic importance (Fox, 1997, Zajac, 2006). These factors affect the herd productivity, the capacity to maintain and improve a herd (i.e. its health and genetic potential), human nutrition, community development and cultural issues relating to the use of livestock (Perry and Randolph, 1999). This is of particular relevance in regards to a rapidly growing human population and an associated increase in the global demand for products of animal origin, emphasizing the importance of maintaining and/or increasing the productivity of the livestock industry (Nonhebel and Kastner, 2011).",

In sheep, the pre-patent period of H. contortus is 18\u201321 days; adult worms are short-lived, surviving in their hosts for only a few months. The main pathogenic effects are caused by the L4s and adults, which both feed on blood, causing severe anaemia which usually becomes apparent after two weeks of infection (Baker et al., 1959). Acute disease is usually intensity-dependent and is associated with signs of haemorrhagic anaemia, dark-coloured faeces, oedema, weakness, reduced production of wool and muscle mass, or sometimes sudden death. In cases of chronic disease, decreased food intake, weight loss and anaemia are most commonly observed (Kassai, 1999). Unlike many other gastrointestinal parasites, H. contortus is not a primary cause of diarrhoea, and its effects on a flock are often not readily detected by routine observation (Zajac, 2006).",

Teladorsagia does not feed on blood, and the main pathogenic effects are caused by its larval stages. Larval development takes place in the gastric glands, leading to nodule formation in abomasal mucosa and extensive damage to parietal cells, in turn causing a decrease in hypochloric acid production (Levine, 1968). Subsequently, the increase in abomasal pH causes a failure of pepsinogen to convert to the active form, pepsin, which results in elevated plasma pepsinogen levels and reduced protein digestion. The severity of the infection depends on concurrent infections, nutritional state of the host and also the ability to develop an immunogenic response (Stear et al., 2003). Commonly, moderate or subclinical infections occur, causing diarrhoea, poor weight gain, weight loss and reduced wool production (Zajac, 2006).",

            "text": "Species of Trichostrongylus represent an important group of parasites of grazing small ruminants. These parasites occur in the small intestine and mainly exert their pathogenic effects in lambs and weaners, but have also been reported to cause a significant depression of wool growth in old animals (Donald et al., 1978). In Australia, the three most common species are Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Trichostrongylus vitrinus and Trichostrongylus rugatus (see Beveridge et al., 1989a). The main pathogenic effects are caused by the exsheathed L3s of T. vitrinus, which burrow between the intestinal villi and lead to the formation of sub-epithelial tunnels (Beveridge et al., 1989b). Young nematodes developing in these tunnels are released 10\u201312 days following infection. The liberation of young adults is associated with extensive damage to the duodenal mucosa and with signs of generalized enteritis, including haemorrhage, oedema and plasma protein loss into the intestinal lumen, and subsequent hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia (Taylor et al., 2007). Infections with Trichostrongylus are often difficult to distinguish from malnutrition in the case of low-intensity infections (Taylor et al., 2007) but, if present at high numbers, cause protracted watery diarrhoea which stains the fleece of the hindquarters \u201cblack scours\u201d (Levine, 1968). Trichostrongylus axei, which inhabits the abomasum, is less common and occurs usually in smaller numbers (Donald et al., 1978).",

            "text": "\nH. contortus is regarded as the most important nematode species in tropical (between 23.5N\u00b0 and 23.5S\u00b0) and subtropical climates (north of 23.5N\u00b0 and south of 23.5S\u00b0), where usually warm temperatures and summer-dominant or uniform rainfall favour the development of this species (O'Connor et al., 2006). In cool, temperate zones (between latitudes 45\u00b0 and 65\u00b0), conditions throughout most of the year are limiting for the development of H. contortus, because its free-living stages are susceptible to low temperatures and desiccation (O'Connor et al., 2006). In the United States, for example, the climate is most suitable for H. contortus in the south-eastern to north-eastern and mid-western states, whilst in the western part of the country cold winters and dry summers reduce the success of this species (see Zajac, 2006). Trichostrongylus and Teladorsagia are more dominant in winter and uniform rainfall zones, because of their resistance to desiccation and their ability to develop at lower environmental temperatures (Beveridge et al., 1989a, Donald et al., 1978, Young and Anderson, 1981). In Mediterranean regions (between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0), cool and wet winters favour the development of free-living stages of Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus, whilst hot and dry summer conditions cause a decrease in larval pasture contamination (O'Connor et al., 2006). For example, in western regions of the United States, arid summers reduce the transmission rate of most gastrointestinal nematodes, and PGE is usually less important than in the eastern part of the United States (Zajac, 2006). In temperate zones (> 40\u00b0), the cooler environment creates a perfect climate for Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus, and peak infections occur during summer and autumn (O'Connor et al., 2006). In warmer temperate zones, such as in south-eastern Australia, where milder winters prevail, peak infections occur in late winter to early spring (Brunsdon, 1980). In the tropics and subtropics, these two genera may be prevalent, but extend to regions with cooler, humid early spring or late autumn conditions (O'Connor et al., 2006). The three most common intestinal species of Trichostrongylus, namely T. vitrinus, T. colubriformis and T. rugatus, may occur sympatrically, but usually one species predominates in a particular geographical region and/or season (De Chaneet and Dunsmore, 1988). T. vitrinus predominates in lambs in Britain (Parnell et al., 1954), northern Europe (Eysker, 1978) or in the winter rainfall environments of south-eastern Australia (Anderson, 1972). T. colubriformis is most prevalent in North America (Levine, 1968), East and South Africa (Grant, 1981) and in the summer rainfall zones of eastern Australia (Southcott et al., 1976). In uniform rainfall zones of eastern Australia and in New Zealand, T. colubriformis and T. vitrinus occur together, but which species predominates depends on the season (Brunsdon, 1970, Waller et al., 1981). T. rugatus is most common in arid climates of South Africa or the inland of Australia (De Chaneet and Dunsmore, 1988).",

Critical to the development of molecular-diagnostic assays for AR is the in-depth knowledge of the mode of action of these chemicals, their target sites and mutations in the genome of parasitic helminths linked to a reduced susceptibility to these drugs (Beech et al., 2011, von Samson-Himmelstjerna, 2006, Wolstenholme et al., 2004). However, although the molecular basis of mechanisms of AR is currently best understood for BZ anthelmintics, concise information for other classes of broad-spectrum anthelmintics is far less elucidated (Taylor et al., 2002). In the case of BZ, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 200 of the \u03b2-tubulin isotype 1 is currently believed to be most closely linked to BZ resistance (Wolstenholme et al., 2004) and has been demonstrated in resistant strains of H. contortus (see Geary et al., 1992), T. colubriformis (see Silvestre and Humbert, 2002) and Te. circumcincta (see Elard and Humbert, 1999) in sheep. At least two more SNPs at position 167 and 198 have been identified, but appear to be less common amongst different species of trichostrongylid nematodes (Beech et al., 2011, Wolstenholme et al., 2004). Besides the sequence changes in \u03b2-tubulin, which are currently believed to be the major cause of BZ resistance, more recent investigations have also suggested a link to the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, which plays a role in the transport of the anthelmintic away from its site of action and may also select for resistance to MLs (Beech et al., 2011).",

This work was further extended by Silvestre and Humbert (2000) by combining the previously described PCR assays with a RFLP procedure, which allowed the phenetic characterization and identification of L3s of H. contortus, T. colubriformis and Te. circumcincta. Alvarez-Sanchez et al. (2005) designed a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) method to determine the allele frequency of \u03b2-tubulin isotype 1 (codon 200) in nematode DNA samples. As stated by the authors, the diagnosis of BZ resistance using this assay showed a significant agreement with phenotypic tests, such as the egg hatch test and the faecal egg count reduction test, and allowed the analysis of allele frequencies in DNA samples from pooled larvae (von Samson-Himmelstjerna, 2006).",

Furthermore, all currently employed molecular assays involve adult nematodes (only available through necropsy of the host) or infective L3s (requires culturing of eggs for 7\u201310 days), but none of the existing assays has yet been assessed for the detection of AR directly from (mixed populations of) eggs, which would significantly reduce the time required for diagnosis. In contrast to the BZs, the molecular mechanisms associated with resistance to LEV and ML anthelmintics are not yet understood in detail, and recent research has suggested that in both cases multiple genes (Beech et al., 2011) are involved in resistance and that resistance is often the result of changes in the parasite other than the immediate drug target, including transporters and drug metabolism (Cvilink et al., 2009). Consequently, the polygenic nature of resistance to these anthelmintics and the lack of reliable or universal markers represent a major obstacle to the development of molecular-diagnostic tools for AR. No molecular test is yet available for these two groups of broad-spectrum anthelmintics.",

Subsequently, validation parameters have to be determined, such as analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity (Conraths and Schares, 2006).

To aid the diagnosis of gastrointestinal nematode infections, a number of approaches have been developed for the interpretation of clinical signs linked to PGE. These approaches include, for example, body condition- (Russel et al., 1969), \u2018dag\u2019- (Larsen et al., 1994) or anaemia-scoring (van Wyk and Bath, 2002).

An aliquot of this suspension is withdrawn to count the eggs present and to then extrapolate the number to the volume of faeces used (in eggs per gram, EPG). Different methods have been developed for this purpose, such as the direct centrifugal flotation method (Lane, 1922), the Stoll dilution technique (Stoll, 1923), the McMaster method (Gordon and Whitlock, 1939) and the Wisconsin flotation method (Cox and Todd, 1962), of which the McMaster method is most widely used (Nicholls and Obendorf, 1994). For decades, numerous modifications of these methods have been described (Levine et al., 1960, Raynaud, 1970, Roberts and O'Sullivan, 1950, Whitlock, 1948), and most teaching and research institutions apply their own modifications to existing protocols (Kassai, 1999). Many of these modifications make use of different flotation solutions, sample dilutions and counting procedures, which achieve varying sensitivities and can complicate the comparison of FECs between laboratories. These inconsistencies make a pooled data analysis or retrospective studies of results between laboratories virtually impossible. The choice of flotation solution, sample dilution and volume examined can have a significant impact on the results obtained using this approach (Cringoli et al., 2004); similarly, biological factors can also limit the interpretation of these results, as described in the following.",

Storage conditions are of importance because they can cause a reduction in egg numbers. An artefactual reduction in FECs occurs primarily due to hatching of eggs or biological degradation (Nielsen et al., 2010). To circumvent this problem, different strategies, such as chemical preservation (Whitlock, 1943), airtight storage (Rinaldi et al., 2011) or refrigeration (Nielsen et al., 2010), have been recommended. Additional considerations are that FECs (i) only reflect patent but not pre-patent infections (Thienpont et al., 1986), (ii) do not provide any information regarding male or immature worms present (McKenna, 1981) and (iii) can be influenced by variation in times of egg excretion by adult worms (Villanua et al., 2006), age of the worm population and/or the immunity, age and sex of the host (Thienpont et al., 1986). Although there are morphological differences between the eggs of socio-economically important nematodes (Georgi and McCulloch, 1989), specific identification cannot be achieved by routine microscopy (with few exceptions, such as Nematodirus spp.) (Lichtenfels et al., 1997).",

However, according to common practice, an FEC of \u2265 200 EPG is regarded to indicate a significant worm burden and is used as basis for the decision for anthelmintic treatment (www.wormboss.com.au). The value of FEC results also depends on the hosts and/or parasite species involved. For example, FEC results for adult cattle are of limited diagnostic value, as they do not usually correlate with worm burden (McKenna, 1981); FECs in cattle are usually low and require more sensitive flotation techniques than for sheep (Mes et al., 2001); for species of Nematodirus, egg counts are also regarded to be of limited value, as most damage is caused by the immature stages before egg-laying commences (McKenna, 1981). In addition, the low sensitivity of FEC techniques, being in the range of 10\u201350 EPG for the McMaster technique, represents a limitation in relation to the diagnosis of AR by FECRT (Levecke et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Although it is unlikely that some of the current limitations of FEC will be resolved in the near future (i.e. those which relate to the fecundity of the nematodes), some recent developments have been made towards improving the procedure. Attempts have been made by the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP) to implement FEC protocols for the assessment of AR in different species of animals (Coles et al., 2006). Lectin staining for the identification of H. contortus eggs (Palmer and McCombe, 1996), computerized image recognition of strongylid eggs (Sommer, 1996) and automated egg counting (Mes et al., 2007) are interesting developments towards improved species identification and differentiation. However, the suitability of the latter two approaches needs rigorous assessment for routine applications because of their technical complexity. With the development of FECPAK, a diagnostic test-kit containing the necessary equipment for coproscopic examination (www.techiongroup.co.nz), efforts have been made to enable sheep farmers to carry out FECs themselves. However, the implementation of such a system requires a significant level of cooperation by farmers, adequate training and integrated quality assurance to ensure that correct diagnoses are made (McCoy et al. 2005). Despite the provision of training courses for farmers, many difficulties in the differentiation of structures observed during coproscopy were encountered for inadequately trained farm employees, limiting the value of the results obtained (McCoy et al., 2005). The development of the FLOTAC egg counting method (Cringoli et al., 2010), seems to be promising. Once validated for different host and parasite species, this method may deliver FECs with increased sensitivity (i.e. 1 EPG) and might represent an alternative to current flotation techniques.",

Currently, a number of protocols have been published which differ in the temperatures, times and media used for culture and the approach of larval recovery (Dinaburg, 1942, Hubert and Kerboeuf, 1984, MAFF, 1986, Roberts and O'Sullivan, 1950, Whitlock, 1956).

This is particularly important to consider when LC results are used to estimate the contribution of different species to mixed infections. One culture protocol is likely to favour the development of one species over others (Dobson et al., 1992). For instance, Whitlock (1956) observed that culture conditions (27 \u00b0C for 7 days) are suitable for most species, but that the free-living stages of Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) species develop better at somewhat lower temperatures. This statement was supported by the findings of Dobson et al. (1992) who demonstrated that the developmental success of the infective larvae in faecal cultures was lower for Te. circumcincta than for T. colubriformis when cultured alone or concurrently, thus indicating that LCs are unreliable for estimating the contribution of individual species in mixed infections. Similar observations were made by Berrie et al. (1988) for the bovine parasites Haemochus placei, Oesophagostomum radiatum and Cooperia pectinata. In this study, these authors observed that the recovery of larvae of H. placei was significantly lower compared with the other two species under the same culture conditions. Based on their findings, the authors stated that faecal culture and subsequent larval differentiation are unsuitable for an accurate estimation of the proportions of individual species in mixed infections and can only be used to provide an indication of the species present (Berrie et al., 1988).",

Therefore, it had been suggested that providing a better-defined medium than faeces might help to obtain more consistent results (Hubert and Kerboeuf, 1984). To further examine this hypothesis, Hubert and Kerboeuf (1984) developed a modified method of LC using an \u2018on-agar\u2019 approach to provide well-defined and standardized conditions.

However, although useful for a differentiation of genera, without the requirement to measure every single larva (and thus being more time efficient), this approach has the disadvantage that it does not allow the unequivocal differentiation of all genera. For instance, Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus (being the most common genera in winter rainfall areas) cannot be differentiated based on sheath extension length alone.

As claimed by the authors, this approach allows the differentiation among populations of T. axei, T. colubriformis, T. vitrinus and Te. circumcincta. However, the authors acknowledge that there is a degree of variability in the number of observed tubercles and that the tails of Te. circumcincta and T. axei lack these structures (McMurtry et al., 2000). Although being regarded as economically \u2018less important\u2019 parasites, the differentiation of L3s of Oesophagostomum and Chabertia, which infect the large intestine, is not considered possible using current techniques for larval differentiation, which makes this approach unsuitable if detailed epidemiological information on distribution and prevalence of genera and species is required. A less commonly used method for larval differentiation involves the culture and morphological identification of L1s (Whitlock, 1959). This technique has the advantage of being rapid, since the time required for the development of the L1 stage is shorter; however, the same limitations for the culture and identification of L3s exist for L1s and L2s (Lichtenfels et al., 1997).",

When parasitized glands of the gastric mucosa are destroyed, the hydrochloric acid production of parietal cells decreases, causing a rise in abomasal pH and resulting in a failure to convert pepsinogen to active pepsin (Levine, 1968). Accumulating pepsinogen can escape between disrupted cell junctions into the blood. Therefore, an increase in serum pepsinogen concentration has been regarded to relate to mucosal damage by developing larval stages of Ostertagia (Levine, 1968). Berghen et al. (1993) reviewed the value and application of pepsinogen, gastrin and antibody responses as diagnostic indicators for ostertagiasis and identified a number of potentially limiting factors. The authors suggested that other parasitic or non-parasitic diseases can be responsible for a moderate rise in pepsinogen concentrations in blood, thus limiting the specificity of this approach.",

Shared antigenic composition of closely related parasite species is a challenge, particularly for nematodes, and often leads to cross-reactivity in immunological tests (Eysker and Ploeger, 2000, Noordin et al., 2005). Also the presence of host materials associated with the parasite can complicate antigen purification and can interfere with the specificity of a diagnostic assay. Furthermore, the life-cycle stage of the parasite used as an antigen source can influence immuno-diagnostic results, as parasites undergo significant structural and biochemical changes during their development (Cohen and Sadun, 1976). As an example, the antigenic composition of larval stages differs from that of adults (Williams and Soulsby, 1970) and can give rise to variations in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (McLaren et al., 1978).",

Also the use of bulk milk samples has been investigated, which has the advantage of being an inexpensive and user-friendly approach (Charlier et al., 2010).

A number of different techniques have been described (Eysker and Kooyman, 1993, MAFF, 1986, Robertson and Elliott, 1966). The differences among these techniques exist in the counting of nematode worms from either the chyme or digesta and/or the washes (separately or combined); the soaking or not of the organ in water or saline (mainly used to recover immature stages); and the proportion of the total volume and the number of aliquots examined (reviewed by Gaba et al., 2006). Other differences exist in the length of the intestinal section examined (proximal 10 m of small intestine vs. the entire length) and the mesh size of the sieve used to remove plant debris from the washes (McKenna, 2008). Most necropsy techniques for the estimation of the intensity of infection involve the counting of worms from pooled gut contents and washes.",

The disadvantage of this method is that it involves more labour at necropsy, but it has the distinct advantage that worms are separated from the bulk of the gut contents, allowing a more rapid worm count in the laboratory. Gaba et al. (2006) assessed their approach for H. contortus and Te. circumcincta and suggested that the estimation of infection intensity, based on gut washes alone, is reliable. However, a prerequisite is that abomasa are processed rapidly (within 15 min) after the death of the sheep, as worms progressively start migrating into the contents (Gaba et al., 2006). Gaba et al. (2006) also stated that immediate washing of the gut is insufficient for extracting T. axei or larvae from the mucosa and, therefore, may distort the results if necropsy is carried out for the purpose of assessing trichostrongylid diversity or to examine the gut for the presence of immature larval stages.",

Therefore, a small sieve size (e.g. 38 \u03bcm aperture) is only necessary if information about early L4s is required, whereas, if studies are carried out to confirm AR (reflected by a reduced efficacy against adult worms), also larger mesh sizes (e.g. 250 \u03bcm aperture) can be used (McKenna, 2008).",

McKenna (2008) claimed that processing only the first 10 m of the small intestine led to a recovery of < 50% of the worms located in the entire length, resulting in serious underestimates of the total number of worms present. However, the data presented were based on the necropsy of only 15 sheep, and a recovery of less than 50% of the total number was observed only in a few individual sheep, whereas in most infected sheep trichostrongylid nematodes were located in the proximal 10 m of the small intestine (cf. McKenna, 2008). Therefore, it can be concluded that the improvement of accuracy achieved by processing the entire small intestine is marginal and involves a significant increase in the amount of labour and time required for processing.",

Complex biological (e.g. faecal) samples can contain a wide range of inhibitory substances (e.g. bile salts, collagen, haeme, humic acids and polysaccharides), which are capable of reducing or preventing PCR amplification (R\u00e5dstr\u00f6m et al., 2004, Wilson, 1997). Different samples can have very different compositions, and the presence of substances potentially inhibitory to the PCR can vary depending on the sample type and composition (Hoorfar et al., 2004, Wilson, 1997). Therefore, the selection and evaluation of the sample preparation approach and a suitable reaction mixture, including polymerases and primers, are critical to obtain PCR-compatible samples of comparable composition, irrespective of the variation in the original matrix (e.g. batch-to-batch variation) (Hoorfar et al., 2004).",

Since different genes evolve at different rates, the DNA region selected should be sufficiently variable in sequence to allow the identification of parasites to the taxonomic level required. For specific identification, the target DNA should display no or minor sequence variation within a species and differ sufficiently in sequence to consistently allow the delineation among species. In contrast, for the purpose of identifying population variants (\u2018strains\u2019 or genotypes), a considerable degree of variation in the sequence should exist within a species. A range of target regions in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes have been employed to achieve the identification of parasites to species or sub-specific genotypes (Anderson et al., 1998, Blouin, 2002, Chilton, 2004, Gasser, 2006). In nuclear ribosomal genes and spacers, there is often less sequence variation among individuals within a population and between populations, which makes them suitable as species-specific markers. Hence, in the case of genetic markers for the specific identification of strongylid nematodes of livestock, most of the focus has been on investigating nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA).",

For instance, the ITS-1 region of the trichostrongylids Ostertagia ostertagi and Ostertagia lyrata (801 bp) (Zarlenga et al., 1998b) is longer than that of other trichostrongylids, including congeners, due to the presence of an internal 204 bp fragment, which is repeated twice (Zarlenga et al., 1998a, Zarlenga et al., 1998b, 2001). No major differences have been detected among species of Teladorsagia/Ostertagia in the lengths of their ITS-2 sequences (Chilton et al., 2001, Stevenson et al., 1996). The G + C content (39\u201350%) of the ITS-1 sequence of species studied is usually greater than of their ITS-2 (29\u201345%). The ITS-2 sequences of some species can be relatively A + T-rich (60\u201370%), which may relate to structural aspects of the precursor rRNA molecule. In addition, studies to date, show that the magnitude of sequence variation in both the ITS-1 and ITS-2 within a species is considerably less (usually < 1.5%) than the levels of sequence differences among species (Gasser, 2006), providing the basis for the specific identification of strongylids and diagnosis of infections of livestock.",

Using rDNA targets, this strategy has also been employed for the development of PCR assays for the genus- or species-specific identification of different developmental stages of strongylid nematodes. For instance, Zarlenga et al., 1998a, Zarlenga et al., 1998b described the development of a semi-quantitative PCR assay for the diagnosis of patent O. ostertagi infection in cattle. Conserved oligonucleotide primers were used in PCR to amplify a ~ 1 kb rDNA region, spanning the ITS-1 and part of the 5.8S rRNA gene, from O. ostertagi, whereas amplicons of ~ 600 bp were amplified from H. contortus, Cooperia oncophora and O. radiatum. When DNA samples derived from adult nematodes of the different genera were mixed and amplified simultaneously, there was no evidence of inhibition in the PCR, and O. ostertagi-specific amplicons were readily detected electrophoretically. There was a correlation between the intensity of the ~ 1-kb and 600-bp amplicons on gels and the percentage of O. ostertagi DNA within the mix of heterologous species. There was also a strong correlation between the percentage of O. ostertagi DNA and percentage of O. ostertagi eggs in the faeces. Effective amplification was achieved from one-twentieth of a single O. ostertagi egg. Hence, the establishment of this PCR assay had major implications for diagnosis of patent O. ostertagi infection in cattle as well as for studying the epidemiology of this parasite. Other studies (reviewed by Gasser, 2006, Gasser et al., 2008) demonstrated the diagnostic utility of PCR assays using species-specific ITS oligonucleotide primers or probes, even when the sequences of related species differ by a single nucleotide (Hung et al., 1999). For instance, Zarlenga et al. (2001) extended previous work to develop a multiplex PCR assay for the specific detection and differentiation of economically important gastrointestinal strongylid nematodes (including H. placei, O. ostertagi, Trichostrongylus spp., Cooperia oncophora/C. surnabada and O. radiatum) of cattle.",

However, a disadvantage is that the dye binds to all double-stranded DNA in a reaction, which includes primer dimers and non-specific products. This limitation can be overcome by acquiring fluorescence data at a temperature that denatures the non-specific products and leaves the specific products intact. The melting point of an amplicon is linked to the composition and length of the nucleotide sequence(s) within it, which means that a melting-curve analysis can be used to detect and/or characterize sequence variation within and among samples. Other recent advances include the complementary use of high resolution melting (HRM) analysis following RT-PCR (e.g. Jeffery et al., 2007). Melting analysis using the dye LCGreen or SYTO9 has been reported to achieve acceptable levels of reproducibility, attaining better mutation detection capacity than SYBR Green I (Monis et al., 2005a, Wittwer et al., 2003). Alternative, more expensive detection systems (other than intercalating dyes) include TaqMan probes (Heid et al., 1996), minor groove binder Eclipse probes (Afonina et al., 2002), molecular beacons (Piatek et al., 1998) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (Chen and Kwok, 1999), ensuring specificity in the PCR through exclusive binding to the target sequence (Monis et al., 2005b).",

The assay developed showed linear quantifiable amplification of DNA obtained from egg quantities ranging from five to 75 eggs, whereas DNA from higher egg numbers of 75\u20131000 eggs did not show significant differences in C\nt, limiting the quantitative capacity of the assay to a narrow detection range (Harmon et al., 2007).

Non-competitive DNA, derived from environmental sources, did not appear to have a negative impact on amplification, but in multiplex reactions, the presence of high amounts of competing trichostrongyle DNA hindered the amplification of a different target species whose DNA is present at much smaller amounts (Harmon et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The storage of faecal samples is often necessary in a practical context, but the possible impact of egg embryonation during prolonged storage is known to be a critical factor relating to the accuracy of quantifying egg numbers by RT-PCR (Bott et al., 2009, Harmon et al., 2007). Therefore, strategies to circumvent this issue should be developed, which could possibly involve allowing maximum development to occur prior to DNA isolation (Harmon et al., 2007). It has been hypothesized that the technique used for DNA extraction and the presence of PCR inhibitors could be responsible also for discrepancies in the linear correlation between DNA amount and number of nematode eggs (Harmon et al., 2007). Harmon et al. (2007) suggested to account for the variability arising from DNA extraction and the presence of faecal inhibitors through the use of multiplex PCR systems that quantify, in relative terms, egg numbers using C\nt values, and include an exogenous DNA template to standardize C\nt values and assess every sample individually for faecal inhibitors (Harmon et al., 2007). Further work in this field had been done by two other research teams, who developed RT-PCR assays for the diagnosis of infections with the human hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus and the nodule worm Oesophagostomum bifurcum (see Verweij et al., 2007) and the equine parasite Strongylus vulgaris (see Nielsen et al., 2008). These assays employed specific primers and TaqMan probes to target the ITS-2 region of nuclear rDNA. Verweij et al. (2007) suggested that false-negative RT-PCR results (n\n = 2) in relation to LC might be explained by the fact that the amount of faeces used for DNA isolation was 30 times less than that used to set up LC. However, both assays were reported by the authors to be of high analytical specificity and of a sensitivity superior to that of LC. Inhibition by faecal components was not evident. A potential limitation of these studies was that the specificity of these assays was based exclusively on the design and use of TaqMan probes. However, HRM or sequencing was not used to verify the identity or specificity of the amplicons produced.",

During this study specific oligonucleotide primers were designed to ITS-2 and 28S rDNA regions of seven key genera or species of strongylids of sheep, including H. contortus, Te. circumcincta, Trichostrongylus spp., C. oncophora, C. ovina, Oesophagostomum columbianum and O. venulosum, and used in separate PCR reactions. To determine relative proportions of species/genera contributing to an FEC, standard curves were prepared for the RT-PCRs for individual species and demonstrated a log\u2013linear relationship over four orders of magnitude. The C\nt values obtained from species-specific PCR reactions showed also a linear correlation to the numbers of eggs present per gram of faeces and demonstrated the applicability of this PCR approach for semi-quantification of target species. For some of the primer pairs used in this study, as little as 0.1\u20132 pg of DNA was sufficient to achieve specific amplification from the respective species, which equates to a proportion of genomic DNA which can be isolated from a single egg (Bott et al., 2009). During the evaluation of this PCR assay, all amplicons generated from specific primer pairs were examined by HRM and sequence analysis to confirm their identity. Designed primers were critically assessed for their analytical specificity (i.e. against a broad range of parasites that are known to be detectable from the faeces of infected sheep, including lungworms), and there was no evidence of non-specific amplification. However, Bott et al. (2009) stated that, due to possible sequence polymorphism or heterogeneity of ITS-2 among or within individuals from different geographical locations, the performance of the PCR platform might need additional assessment, if applied in different countries or regions.",

            "text": "\nBott et al. (2009) also raised some points that needed consideration for future applications, such as the effect of faecal consistency on FEC and PCR results. The testing of loose/diarrhoeic and desiccated faecal samples can lead to an under- and over-estimation, respectively, of FECs (Le Jambre et al., 2007) and likely variability in semi-quantitative PCR results. Furthermore, Bott et al. (2009) discussed the need for rapid DNA isolation from faecal samples following their collection. The results of previous studies (Harmon et al., 2007) indicated that mitosis during the larval development leads to an increase of ITS-2 copy number and results in enhanced amplification during the RT-PCR. Because the storage and transport of samples at ambient temperatures is often necessary for practical reasons, approaches for the preservation of faecal material, for example, ethanol fixation might be applied. In addition, the direct extraction of DNA from faeces, using commercially available kits, has been proposed as an alternative to methods that involve the concentration of eggs by faecal flotation prior to DNA isolation (cf. Bott et al., 2009, Nielsen et al., 2008). However, such direct extraction methods need to be critically assessed for their ability to remove potential inhibitors (e.g. humic acids, phenolic compounds or blood) from faeces. A faecal flotation and egg isolation approach has been shown to remove such inhibitors (Bott et al., 2009) and has the advantage that it provides an FEC, which can be compared with a PCR result but which is not possible employing a direct DNA isolation-coupled PCR method. Furthermore, flotation allows for a concentration of eggs from multiple grams of faeces prior to DNA isolation and PCR, thus increasing the likelihood of amplifying DNA from very small numbers of nematode eggs (Bott et al., 2009, Nielsen et al., 2008). By contrast, only small amounts of faeces (e.g. ~ 0.25 g) are used in most commercially available, direct faecal DNA isolation methods, limiting the \u2018sensitivity\u2019 of subsequent PCR. Noting these limitations, the combined microscopic-molecular method (Bott et al., 2009) was established for the specific diagnosis of patent strongylid infections in sheep, and future work is required to evaluate the performance of this method for the specific diagnosis of infections with immature (pre-patent) or hypobiotic stages (e.g. Te. circumcincta or H. contortus) of nematodes and to compare it with direct amplification from DNA isolated directly from faecal samples.",

The authors compared the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of this RT-PCR assay with a conventional faecal flotation method. They also established a system to rank the contribution of particular strongylid nematodes to the FECs from \u2018mixed infections\u2019 in individual sheep. The testing of faecal samples revealed that Te. circumcincta (80%) and Trichostrongylus spp. (66%) were most prevalent, followed by C. ovina (33%), O. venulosum (28%) and H. contortus (1%). For most sheep tested in this study, Te. circumcincta and Trichostrongylus spp. represented the largest proportion of strongylid eggs in faecal samples from individual sheep. This was the first large-scale prevalence survey of gastrointestinal nematodes in live sheep utilizing a molecular tool. The ability to rapidly rank strongylid nematodes according to their contribution to mixed infections represents a major advantage over routine flotation methods. The conclusion from this study was that this RT-PCR tool might be able to replace the conventional technique of LC.",

In addition, of 53 field samples which were test-negative based on coproscopy, 23 tested positive by PCR for one or more target nematodes (a result which was confirmed by sequencing), demonstrating better sensitivity of the molecular approach compared with coproscopic examination, and reinforcing that microscopy is not an adequate reference technique (i.e. is an imperfect gold standard; cf. Conraths and Schares, 2006) for the detailed assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic assay. The results achieved demonstrated that the prevalences of key genera/species, such as Te. circumcincta and Trichostrongylus spp., known to be the dominant species infecting sheep in the winter rainfall environment of Victoria, Australia, were largely in accordance with information available in the published literature (e.g. Anderson, 1972, Anderson, 1973). The application of an ordinal ranking system to estimate the contribution of individual parasites to observed FEC results showed that these genera/species were also responsible for the largest proportion of strongylid eggs in the faecal samples tested. Although known to be abundant in winter rainfall environments, C. ovina and O. venulosum were found at high prevalence (33.6% and 28.7%, respectively). An unexpected finding was that O. venulosum was the main contributor to the observed FEC results for one of nine farms tested, which has important implications for the interpretation of FECs and anthelmintic control.",

This common practice, which involves frequent and, in many cases, unnecessary or excessive administration of anthelmintic drugs can promote AR development in gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep and other hosts, as recent evidence has shown (Kaplan, 2004, Wolstenholme et al., 2004). Given that O. venulosum is recognized to be less pathogenic than most strongylids of the upper alimentary tract (Donald et al., 1978) but has high fecundity (Gordon, 1981), FEC results (e.g. > 200 EPG) in which O. venulosum is the sole or main contributor would be misinterpreted, and sheep harbouring this relatively non-pathogenic would be treated unnecessarily. Therefore, the specific/generic identification of infecting nematodes assists the interpretation of FEC results and, subsequently, treatment decisions, thus, directly contributing to efforts of preserving the efficacy of currently available anthelmintics.",

Data from this study provided new and important insights into the composition and distribution of nematodes, which would not have been achievable in such detail using any of the currently used coprological methods. The results indicated that this tool should be applicable in other climatic regions and/or major sheep producing countries in the world. Depending on the nematode species infecting sheep in a particular climatic zone, minor modifications could be made to the molecular assay to adapt it for the diagnosis of infections with other important parasites (e.g. hookworm or lungworm) and to provide opportunities to study their biology, prevalence and distributions. For instance, as the life cycles of some lungworms, such as Muellerius capillaris and Protostrongylus rufescens, involve invertebrate intermediate hosts, such as snails and slugs, an adapted RT-PCR assay could be used to examine the prevalence and relative intensity of these parasites in their intermediate hosts and to study their ecology.",

(2012a) assessed the RT-PCR assay to support the diagnosis of AR in nematodes, in conjunction with conventional FECRT; in addition, a direct comparison of PCR results with those of LC and selective total worm counts (TWCs; considered a \u2018gold standard\u2019) was undertaken. In this assessment, the molecular assay achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 87.5% in relation to TWC. These percentages where similar to those achieved previously (Roeber et al., 2011) (diagnostic sensitivity 98% and specificity 100% in relation to FEC), demonstrating that the RT-PCR assay consistently achieved a high diagnostic performance. DNA sequencing results also demonstrated that this molecular assay had a better sensitivity than the routinely used TWC method and, together with FECRT, was of practical value for the detection of albendazole resistance in Te. circumcincta and T. colubriformis populations. However, although the PCR test results were in accordance with TWC, the direct comparison of molecular and LC results showed markedly different findings, depending on the recommended measurements used for larval differentiation (Dikmans and Andrews, 1933, Gordon, 1933, McMurtry et al., 2000). Using the morphometric criteria given by Dikmans and Andrews (1933), the majority of L3s from the LC of the albendazole treated group of sheep were identified as Trichostrongylus, whereas, using the measurements recommended by Gordon (1933) and McMurtry et al. (2000), the same larvae were identified as Teladorsagia. This discrepancy emphasizes the complications and errors associated with the use of LC, which can readily lead to misinterpretations as to which nematodes are resistant to a particular drug. Overall, this study (Roeber et al., 2012a) demonstrated clearly that the molecular assay coupled to FECRT provides a rapid, efficient and universally applicable tool for the diagnosis of AR and the early detection of residual populations of worms in sheep following treatment. Future studies should be conducted to test sheep on different farms and the response of gastrointestinal nematodes to the treatment with other main groups of anthelmintics, such as imidazothiazoles/tetrahydropyrimidines or MLs, and also the newly developed monepantel (Zolvix, Novartis) (Kaminsky et al., 2008).",

Therefore, the routine use of the RT-PCR assay, in conjunction with FECRT, could provide a universally applicable method to test sheep before transport to and/or introduction on to a new farm, in order to reduce the spread of drug-resistant populations of nematodes. In addition, the assay allows the identification of sheep shedding large numbers of parasite eggs in faeces and, in conjunction with information about the infecting helminth species, can be used to support \u2018targeted, selective treatment\u2019 approaches (Kenyon et al., 2009). Such a strategy focuses on treating only sheep that will benefit most from an anthelmintic treatment, whereas sheep with low-intensity infections remain untreated to provide refugia for the dilution of resistance genes within a parasite population. Furthermore, the present RT-PCR assay had a similar or improved sensitivity compared with post-mortem diagnosis, thus being able to replace the latter. In practice, this means that the presence of particular species/genera and their prevalence can be assessed reliably without the need to kill sheep.",

Although conventional multiplex RT-PCR (e.g. Chamberlain et al., 1988) seemed to be a promising prospect at first, preliminary work conducted (Bott N.J. and Gasser R.B., unpublished) showed that primer sets used in individual PCRs (cf. Bott et al., 2009) could not be incorporated into a single reaction to achieve specific amplifications. Other restrictions of a conventional multiplex PCR approach are that each target sequence requires a probe for fluorescence-based detection at a particular wave length and that such probes are costly and require the use of multi-channel RT-PCR thermocyclers\u2014which usually have only four to six distinct wave-length channels, thus limiting the number of species/genera that can be detected.",

MT-PCR consists of two amplification phases: (i) a primary \u2018target enrichment\u2019 phase (through a small number of PCR cycles) conducted using multiplexed primer sets and (ii) a subsequent analytical amplification phase (utilizing a diluted product from the primary amplification as a template), consisting of the targeted amplification, in tandem rather than by multiplex, of each genetic locus using specific, nested primers. Because the initial amplification phase is limited to 10\u201315 cycles, interactions between or among multiplexed primer sets is minimized, reducing competition or the generation of artefactual products and limiting amplification bias, which would otherwise prevent downstream quantification (Stanley and Szewczuk, 2005). Because the primary amplicons are diluted (e.g. 100-fold) prior to use as templates in the secondary phase, primer carry over and PCR inhibition are substantially reduced. By conducting the secondary (analytical) amplification phase in tandem, the method can be coupled to a single-channel, RT-PCR thermocycler, allowing rapid screening and quantification employing one fluorogenic dye (e.g. SYTO9), thus reducing the cost associated with detection.",

The MT-PCR achieved high diagnostic specificity (87.5%) and sensitivity (100%) based on the testing of a panel of 100 faecal DNA samples from helminth-free sheep and 30 samples from sheep with infections confirmed by necropsy. This MT-PCR assay was then used to test 219 faecal samples from sheep with naturally acquired infections from various geographical localities within Australia, and results were compared with those of LC, using 139 of the 219 samples. The MT-PCR and LC results correlated significantly for most nematodes examined, but parasites of the large intestine were significantly under-represented in the LC results. The findings showed that Trichostrongylus spp. (87%), Teladorsagia circumcincta (80%) and H. contortus (67%) had the highest prevalences, followed by O. venulosum (51%) and C. ovina (12%). Importantly, this MT-PCR allowed a species- or genus-specific diagnosis of patent nematode infections to be made within 24 h (compared with 7\u201310 days for LC).",

The testing of samples from sheep from different geographical locations in Australia showed that the prevalence of the key nematodes investigated were consistent with their presumed distribution, based on historical data and many years of studies conducted using routine diagnostic procedures (Donald et al., 1978). Epidemiological information had not been provided in such detail prior to the use of a molecular-diagnostic tool, and the results achieved by routine LC and the molecular-diagnostic platform showed significant correlations (r\ns\n = 0.69\u20130.83) for most nematodes. However, C. ovina and O. venulosum were both much less frequently detected in LC than by the molecular assays. Thus, the evidence showed that LC was unreliable for the diagnosis of infections with these two nematodes and did not allow their prevalence and distribution to be studied with any confidence. Importantly, the inability of LC to detect the latter two species subsequently led to an over-estimation of other nematodes, namely H. contortus, Trichostrongylus and Teladorsagia, present in the LCs examined, thus providing a biassed result. This finding also highlights the utility of the present molecular-diagnostic platform for epidemiological studies and suggests that results obtained previously using traditional diagnostic techniques might have led to inaccurate information on the prevalence and distribution of particular species of gastrointestinal nematodes. The findings of Roeber et al., 2012a, Roeber et al., 2012b showed that C. ovina and O. venulosum may contribute much more significantly to infections in sheep than currently acknowledged. Given that the pathogenicity of these parasites is considered low (Donald et al., 1978), it is likely that the inability of classical techniques to reliably identify and quantify these parasites has led to unnecessary anthelmintic treatments at increased cost to the farmer and an increased risk of AR in nematode populations.",

This approach has significant implications for studying the epidemiology and ecology (i.e. the seasonal occurrence of species and length of larval survival) of gastrointestinal nematodes in livestock, and enables assessments of the degree of contamination and risk of infection. For this purpose, pasture foliage could be collected, washed and concentrated; DNA could then be isolated from the larval suspension and molecular testing conducted. However, as the number of cells increases during the mitotic division of developing eggs and larvae, the number of ITS-2 copies also increases, which means that the MT-PCR platform will need to be calibrated to accommodate this variation. This PCR platform permits different sensitivity settings (based on the number of amplification cycles in the primary PCR) and, whilst a medium sensitivity (15 cycles of primary amplification) was shown to produce the best results for the detection of eggs from faeces, this sensitivity setting could be adjusted for L3s from pasture samples.",

Immunological methods could also be used in concert with FECRT to measure protective effects of anti-nematode vaccines for sheep following challenge infection/s (with reference to well-defined controls). Moreover, to further refine the diagnosis of AR, genomic DNA regions linked to resistance (e.g. \u03b2-tubulin gene) could be integrated as targets into the assay.

Furthermore, such a platform could also be adapted, with modifications being made to the DNA isolation procedure and primers used, for the diagnosis of infections with blood pathogens (e.g. Babesia and Theileria) or the detection of pathogens in environmental samples. In addition, although we have focused on the development of this platform for the detection and identification of pathogens of socio-economic importance in sheep (Roeber et al., 2012b), a similar approach would be of major benefit assessing such pathogens in other hosts, including other small ruminants, cattle, horses and even humans. For example, estimating the number of nematode eggs in the faeces from adult cattle is challenging, as eggs are generally present in low numbers and, thus, require more sensitive techniques of diagnosis (Agneessens et al., 2000, Mes et al., 2001). Therefore, the MT-PCR-coupled diagnostic platform could be further enhanced by automating the counting of eggs in faecal samples prior to DNA isolation. Approaches that involve the recovery of nematode eggs from faeces and the automated counting of all eggs present in a sample (as opposed to the counting of eggs from sub-aliquots of a sample and their extrapolation to the total sample volume) by image recognition have been developed (Mes et al., 2001, Mes et al., 2007).

The use of DNA samples has the advantage that the sample material collected can be stored (at \u2212 80 \u00b0C) in a clean and space efficient manner (i.e. either in frozen or in dehydrated form), allowing the testing of the samples many years or even decades later. This provides the opportunity of carrying out (even retrospectively) studies of \u2018new\u2019 or \u2018emerging\u2019 pathogens. These are important applications in times of changing environmental conditions (e.g. climate change, urbanization and associated changes in pathogen transmission, distribution and epidemiology), increased problems with AR as well as the increased mobility of humans and/or animals between/among different regions or countries.",

            "text": "The accurate diagnosis of gastrointestinal nematode infections of livestock underpins investigations of the biology, ecology and epidemiology of parasites and supports the monitoring of emerging problems with AR. Current, routinely used methods of diagnosis rely on the detection or morphological identification of the infective stages (eggs and/or larvae) of these nematodes from the faeces from their hosts. Until recently, these classical techniques, which are mostly time consuming and laborious, had not undergone any substantial technological advancement in the past decades. Because key stages (mainly eggs and larvae) of numerous genera and species of nematodes infecting livestock lack distinctive morphological features, traditional approaches are not able to achieve an accurate species- or even genus-specific diagnosis, making it difficult to conduct reliable studies of the biology, epidemiology and ecology of parasites, unless expensive and time-consuming post-mortem investigations are conducted. This situation has also hampered investigations of the occurrence and distribution of AR in strongylid nematodes of livestock, which represents a global problem.",

            "text": "Advances in PCR-based technologies and the availability of specific genetic markers in the ITSs of nuclear rDNA have provided the opportunity of developing enhanced PCR-based tools for diagnosis (reviewed by Gasser, 2006, Gasser et al., 2008). Current evidence (Roeber et al., 2011, 2012a,b) shows that RT-PCR and MT-PCR assays can replace the inaccurate and time-consuming method of LC in routine diagnostic laboratories. This high-throughput MT-PCR assay takes < 1 day to perform, compared with at least a week for LC, thus reducing the time that the sheep producer has to wait for a diagnosis. From a service provision perspective, this platform does not require detailed technical expertise of the operator, has high sensitivity and specificity and has broad applicability, in that it can be used to carry out large-scale epidemiological studies, to support the diagnosis of drug resistance and will be applicable or adaptable to other parasites and/or hosts. Furthermore, the MT-PCR platform delivers, rapidly, objective and detailed results (according to genus or species), which is of major value for the design of enhanced control strategies (Table 4.1). Overall, the evidence presented shows that the MT-PCR (Roeber et al., 2012b) essentially meets the international standards (Conraths and Schares, 2006, Office International des Epizooties, 2004) required for use in a laboratory setting for research or routine diagnostic purposes and has major advantages over-classical methods, particularly in relation to the interpretation of FEC results and recommendations about anthelmintic treatment. This assay enhances the diagnosis of infections with nematode species, which are problematic to detect or identify by traditional coprological techniques, either because of their unfavourable development under standard culture conditions or their high morphological/morphometric similarity with other species/genera (i.e. Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus, C. ovina and O. venulosum). Consequently, this advance in diagnosis allows gaps in our current knowledge of the epidemiology and distribution of these parasites (being associated mainly with the inaccuracy of traditional diagnostic techniques) to be overcome.",

DNA-based methods of diagnosis have significant advantages, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, time required to conduct the assay and can be standardized among and within laboratories. These features make them suitable to be incorporated into surveillance systems, which are based on a \u2018from stable-to-table\u2019 approach, such as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP). The routine application of such high-throughput and automated diagnostic platforms provides major scope for better disease surveillance and for detailed epidemiological investigations, shorter response times to tackle and control disease outbreaks (as the diagnosis using molecular tools generally takes less time compared with culture- or microscopy-based approaches) and, ultimately, to provide greater protection for the consumer of animal products (Fig. 4.1). The data obtained using such methods would help government authorities, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), Office International des Epizootis (OIE) and/or the World Health Organization (WHO) in the detailed tracking and mapping of disease outbreaks or spreads, to make forecasts about their occurrence and to implement appropriate contingency plans and guidelines for effective and sustainable pathogen control.",

This assay has improved diagnostic performance over-traditional diagnostic techniques and is considered to provide a new benchmark. This robotic molecular assay delivers high performance for epidemiological surveys and can be used efficiently, in combination with FECRT, to support the detection and monitoring of AR. Due to its semi-automated, high-throughput nature, this method can now replace traditional diagnostic approaches and is suitable for routine application in service and research laboratories. The assay may need to be adapted to include the testing for additional parasites, depending on where the assay is to be deployed. Current evidence indicates that this robotic assay is highly adaptable, allowing the development of a wide range of next-generation diagnostic tools to underpin the control of socio-economically important infectious diseases of animals and the detection and monitoring of drug resistance. Could this be a turning point in the diagnosis of parasitic diseases of livestock?",
