This includes the mandatory use of PPE which includes gowns, gloves, face masks, and either n-95, P100, or FFP2 respirators with a face shield/googles or powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) to minimize the risk of transmissibility and cross-infection.6 Per CDC recommendations, a clinically suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient should wear a cloth face covering, over nose, and mouth and a surgical mask should be reserved for HCP and first responders.6 Unfortunately, these PPE recommendations for both providers and patients will fail to prevent transmission if frequent surfaces decontamination, enhanced hand hygiene, and avoiding self-contamination are not carefully considered. Providers must focus on meticulous hand hygiene and disinfecting personal items, such as stethoscopes, phones, ID tags, laptops, dictation devices, etc. A route to minimize exposure and contact between triage to induction room, OR, and then to recovery rooms should be frequently cleaned and disinfected. It is recommended for an environmental services worker to increase the frequency to disinfect the most contaminated and most touched surfaces, such as the elevator buttons, door handles, light switches, grab rails, and etc. A recent study examined the most contaminated objects and PPE in the hospitals of Wuhan, China. Of the samples collected from HCP using PPE (hand sanitizer dispensers, gloves, and protective eyewear/full-face shield), 12.9% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The highest rates of contamination were found on hand sanitizer dispensers, gloves, goggles/face-shields at a rate of 20.3%, 15.4%, and 1.7%, respectively.7",

            "text": "COVID-19 is presumed to spread directly via infectious respiratory droplets and close contact (because SARS-CoV-2 cannot survive without a carrier).12 However, these transmission modes do not explain all cases. Recent data have shown that COVID-19 might survive and be transmitted indirectly from virus contamination of common surfaces and objects after virus aerosolization in a confined space with by infected individuals.12 The incubation period for COVID-19 is approximately 4 days, and studies suggest that it may range anywhere from 2 to 14 days.13-15 A recent study investigating SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens found that RNA virus detected in blood samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients (3 of 307; 1%).16 Huang et al17 reported that 15% of patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 had viral RNA in their plasma. The implications of these findings are still unclear, and there are no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronaviruses through April 5, 2020. However, continued vigilance is essential. Despite studies detecting viral RNA in the serum or plasma of confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients, blood transmission and infectivity are still not fully understood. Because there is little evidence and vague guidelines for blood transfusion in the current setting, it is recommended to recuse anyone with symptoms or signs of respiratory illness from blood donation.18 The US FDA has suggested to retrieve and quarantine any blood products collected in the 28 days before, or after, either COVID-19 disease onset or possible exposure to individuals who are COVID-19 positive.18 Theoretically, viremia in patients with asymptomatic or confirmed COVID-19 patients could pose a risk of transmissibility to the orthopaedic team during aerosolized blood-generating procedures.19 The use of high-speed drills, bone saws, reamers, electrocautery, and ultrasonic scalpels generate significant amounts of aerosols, increasing the risk of viral contamination of the environment.20 A recent Canadian study described low-fidelity simulation training to evolve the modified PPE used for aerosol-generating procedures of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients and assess the sites of contamination21 The spread of the aerosolized respiratory secretions and contamination sites were visualized with a commercial powder product and ultraviolet light. They demonstrated a significant amount of contamination on the provider's neck, base of the wrist, and their lower pants and shoes. These sites, however, are probably not associated with a direct method of transmission for SARS-CoV-2. However, there are definite sources of self-contamination during PPE doffing. In addition, the disposable AAMI Level-III fluid-resistant, surgical gowns or coveralls are recommended because they detected no contamination of scrubs beneath the surgical gown compared with reusable surgical gowns (AAMI, Level-II). The AAMI, level-II gowns were permeable to aerosolized secretions. The recommended PPE for performing respiratory aerosol or aerosolized blood-generating procedures for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients (Table 1):PAPR is preferred for long operations (if available)Fitted, NIOSH-certified n-95 mask, with the following:Eye protection; goggles (covered sides of eyes) or full-face shields (if available)Surgical hood with ties (head and neck covering)Disposable AAMI level-III surgical gown or coverallsDouble high-cuffed surgical gloves (alternately, vertical strips of tape can keep gloves secured to the gown and minimize exposing wrist to contamination (N.B. Circumferential taping may make doffing more challenging)22Shoes or booties worn should be fluid-resistant and easily to be decontaminated (disposable shoe covers might increase the risk of contamination)Hand hygiene before and after donning/doffing PPEA shower after an aerosolized blood-generating procedure is very prudent.",

These measures aim to mitigate the anticipated risk of global shortage of PPEs, such as surgical mask, N-95 mask, gowns, etc. Extended use or limited reuse are applicable alternatives to prevent the anticipated supply shortage of face masks, respirators, and protective eyewear equipment and to ensure that healthcare staff have secured access to the necessary supplies for patient care. Limited PPE reuse refers to the practice of using the same N-95 mask for multiple encounters with patients removing it between encounters and doffing to ensure proper fit and the absence of gross contamination. In the operative setting, this may be done by wearing. Consider placing a simple surgical mask over the N-95 for preventing gross contamination. N-95 respirator and change it between encounters. Reuse of protective eyewears, such as full-face shields and goggles, will be allowed if these are individually assigned to each member and regularly get disinfected. Reuse practice is permitted for a single person use (no-sharing). Reuse and reprocessing of the N-95 mask guidelines have been released by the CDC and include the use of ultraviolet light processing, hydrogen peroxide in either liquid or vaporized state, and moist heating decontamination.24 These guidelines should be reviewed at length before attempting reprocessing of equipment to prevent potentially catastrophic error. Extended use refers to the practice of using the same respirators for repeated close contact encounters with multiple patients, without doffing it between the encounters. This practice might be preferred over reuse, assuming this would reduce the risk of self-contamination through frequent donning and doffing of the same equipment. These practices vary between institutions especially for using N-95 masks. Theoretically, the HCP could extend this and tolerate wearing N-95 masks for up to 8 to 12 hours.25,26 However, most providers usually take breaks during shifts for lunch/toilets. Therefore, extended use beyond 4 hours might be impractical in most settings,27 although limited reuse practice could be adopted with negative or low-risk patients.28",

Ideally, two types of hospital segregation should be done. Location-based segregation of orthopaedic staff reduces the potential risk of cross-infection. Orthopaedic surgeons, for example, should not be performing screening examinations on the general public because of the risk of exposure. Geographic segregation within the OR complex limits the OR traffic, decreases the exposure, and minimizes the contamination zone.30 With the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, orthopaedic staff should be segregated into those who are treating suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients and those who are treating noninfective patients when possible is not. This however may not be possible in smaller hospital systems and practices. Besides screening and isolation of high-risk, confirmed COVID-19 patients, strict and frequent screening of the segregated OR staff is mandatory. Members of the segregated or exposed staff should immediately report any signs of illness and must be taken off duty immediately. In addition, all contact events between patients and staff must be recorded so that contact tracing and infection control measures can be implemented quickly, in case any member of segregated staff tested positive.",

Recent studies highlighted the necessity to isolate and operate on suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients within negative pressure OR/isolation room to disseminate the viral load.21,22,28,32 However, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system in most of the US operating rooms is designed to provide positive pressure. Considering the current poorly controlled situation, adding a portable, self-contained high efficiency particulate air filtration system to the hospital heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems would economically create a negative pressure that meets the OSHA and CDC TB guidelines.34When possible, entry to the OR must be only through the anesthetic induction room.All OR doors should be well sealed once the patient is transferred in (except one door).The OR team involved in the surgery should be limited.Limit the OR access and movement in and out to medically/surgically essential purposes.Strict adherence to high standard of infection control and prevention.Surface-tough equipment and screens within OR should be wrapped with plastic sheets to facilitate decontamination (the virus can survive within tiny grooves, under buttons, screen peripheries, etc.).",

After surgery, the patient's immune system may be compromised, and there may be lower respiratory tract and/or wound infections generally associated with fever. In light of this information, surgeons must be more vigilant to differentiate common postoperative complications from COVID-19 infections. In the presence of fever and one of the symptoms of a respiratory infection (dry cough, etc), laboratory tests for COVID-19 diagnosis must be ordered. Suspected cases should be reported immediately, and under the premise of ensuring the safety of patient, transportation to an isolation ward. Surgeons, nurses, and medical staff share an equal responsibility for the postoperative management, particularly in monitoring the patients' families and visitors to ensure the strict adherence to the pandemic emergency system. When possible, it is important to limit the visitors as much as possible. In fact, most hospitals have recently discontinued visitation by anyone. Postoperatively, patients should receive adequate nutrition, fluid hydration, and electrolyte balance to promote immune recovery and rapid rehabilitation. Frequent monitoring of temperature, laboratory CBC counts, C-reactive protein, ferritin level should be done in any patient with suspected COVID-19.

Telemedicine could act as a virtual postoperative PPE to provide impeccable social distancing for patients' safety and for all HCPs so critically needed in frontline against the pandemic.

Orthopaedic educators should educate their fellows, residents, students, and ancillary teams in preventing exposure to and the spreading of COVID-19. The care teams must learn how to protect themselves during a pandemic. Refresher training regarding the standard use of PPE is a necessity in this global pandemic. A recent study at the University of Illinois Chicago56 assessed the PPE doffing practices of healthcare workers. The study demonstrated that 90% of observed PPE doffing was incorrect regarding the doffing sequence, doffing technique, or use of appropriate PPE.56 Another survey showed that 14.9% of healthcare personnel did not receive previous training for appropriate PPE doffing practices.57 Training and education might flatten the curve of cross-infection and self-contamination. Training and education of the surgical staff should be continually emphasized. It is imperative that all staff be taught the proper sequential methods of donning and doffing of PPE and mask-fitting techniques to minimize the risk of self-contamination. Frequent audits of infection control must be conducted. A trained observer should be assigned for each emergent operation to identify the weaknesses and implement the necessary steps.",
