In the tropics, warm climate, poverty, lack of education, and poor sanitation provide an ideal environment for pathogens, vectors, and intermediate hosts to flourish.1 In this vast landmass, respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Respiratory infections may be due to common pathogens encountered worldwide, as well as mycobacterial, parasitic, and fungal organisms. Infections are more prominent in immunocompromised hosts. On the other hand, non-communicable diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer, occupational lung diseases) are increasingly recognized in the tropics, where low socio-economic, educational, and nutritional status favor worse prognosis. A reasonable approach to the patient with lung disease in the tropics starts with age, occupational exposure, physical examination, HIV status, chest x-ray, and blood tests.",

Foul-smelling sputum is associated with anaerobic infections due to aspiration, lung abscess, and necrotizing pneumonia. A blood count usually reveals leukocytosis in bacterial pneumonia, a normal white cell count or leukopenia in viral infection, and eosinophilia in parasitic infection. When available, chest x-ray, serum procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein can be obtained (Fig. 1.3\n). Naso-pharyngeal swabs for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can help establish the diagnosis of specific viral infections if available.",
