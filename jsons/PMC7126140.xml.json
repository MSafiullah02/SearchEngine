For example, according to a report issued by the Airline Transport Association (ATA, 2008), since 1978, at least two hundred commercial airlines have had to merge with other airline companies, seek bankruptcy protection, and/or liquidate or terminate their operations. The report specifically highlights that 12 carriers filed for bankruptcy protection during a period of three years from 2005 to 2008. Due to the economic crises in the last decade, the period between 2000 and 2005 saw a 27% reduction in the number of employees at the six largest air carriers (Scovel, 2006). While the transport service index in terms of passengers and freight increased from 2000 to 2006, a clearly unstable trend can be observed since 2006 (see Fig. 1\n).",

Moreover, the survival of each company, especially in the current financial crisis, depends on whether its managers can identify useful policy to control and improve performance given such a situation. In the current market environment, the question is therefore what type of policy should airlines adopt to stabilise or improve their performance. One strategic move is to form alliances through mergers or acquisitions of two or more companies. This step avoids bankruptcy and may form a strong coalition among companies. Examples of such coalitions are United Airlines with Continental and AirTran with Southwest.",

            "text": "According to Caves (1998), little attention has been paid to how aging affects firm performance. Investigating the relation between firm age and performance reveals whether firms are able to implement proper strategies to stay relevant and find ways to constantly renew themselves. If performance declines as firm age increases, it indicates that older firms are not able to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities with greater congruence to market expectations. As a result, some of these aged firms are eventually taken over (Loderer et al., 2009). This paper highlights the potential influence of firm age on the indicators under control by airline managers given the current economic situation. The relationship between the economic situation and internal operation is well established in a way where managers will come up with survival and cost strategies to perform well under current market conditions. Here firm age plays a role in a way that it represents the experience of a company. Anderson and Eshima (2011) argued that older firms are not able to capture the value from entrepreneurial strategies as their younger counterparts are. This is supported by other researchers such as Hannan and Freeman (1984) who found that age can have adverse effects on performance because of the organisational rigidities and impaired firm\u2019s ability to perceive valuable signals. However, it is also believed that firms learn about their abilities and about how to come up with strategies to survive better as they grow older (Baker and Kennedy, 2002).",

In particular, firm age has been used in airline performance modelling as an independent variable with route frequency, route length, passenger growth, and aircraft size (Malighetti et al., 2011). However, passenger growth and route frequency are both influenced by firm age and it cannot be considered as an independent variable. Although firm age is a variable that can be used to show a company\u2019s experience, it cannot be used as the only independent variable that directly affects performance. This variable is only used to produce knowledge that can then be applied by managers in planning and performing flight strategies and programming.",

To achieve this aim, the first step in our analysis is to investigate the relationship between the economic situation, internal operation and airline performance. This is followed by establishing the moderating effect of firm age on the relationship between the economic situation and internal operations. In the final step, the relationships between the three variables are investigated again, this time taking into account the moderating effect of the variable firm age. The contribution of the research is the use of firm age as a moderator, which has not been performed before in airline performance modelling.",

One of the pioneer academic studies was carried out by Caves et al. (1984). This study estimated total factor productivity as a measure of performance for 11 major airline companies. Four outputs (including Revenue Passenger Miles (RPMs) for charter and scheduled, revenue ton miles of mail, and revenue ton miles of other freight), which were mainly associated with airline performance with five inputs (including ground equipment, flight equipment, fuel, ground property, and labour), were used to estimate the Index of total factor productivity for each airline company. In another study, Sickles (1985) tested a nonlinear model and the growth of specific factors of productivity based on sixteen local American airline companies, which included cases from 1970 to 1978, to estimate performance. Sickles\u2019 model included estimates of material, labour, capital, and energy inputs. He employed these variables to reach an estimated cost function that was able to describe a company\u2019s production technology. In the following year, Sickles et al. (1986) used the same data between 1970 and 1981 and evaluated and assessed the deregulation in the sample airline companies. For this purpose, the researchers initiated an airline performance model, which contained 13 airlines with material, labour, energy, and capital, as the input variables to be able to forecast passenger and cargo incomes.",

It was only in following years that innovations made through computerised reservation system technology created the opportunity to set up and enable revenue yield management systems for revenue-side productivity and ticket price recovery. Therefore, with the implementation of computerised reservation systems, new variables were taken into consideration to estimate the performance of airlines companies by researchers. In other words, variables in connection with ticket selling through agencies using reservation systems were also added to the companies\u2019 other internal variables. The U.S. Transportation Department developed a model in 1988 in which data on an airline\u2019s revenue shares were collected during the year from different airline agencies via their computerised reservation systems (Duliba et al., 2001). Therefore, with the implementation of computerised reservation systems in airlines and agencies, new indicators were taken into consideration to estimate the performance of airline companies by researchers. Most of these variables, such as the number of agencies, the number of systems for ticket sales and reservations, and even travel agent commissions have been effective in evaluating performance.",

Consequently, variables relating to reservation and ticket sales have been discarded from subsequent research models. This industry change is a consequence of not only unexpected shock factors, such as September 11th, other terrorist attacks, or the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) phenomenon in China 2003 but also the result of changes in macroeconomic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Products (GDP) growth in different countries and regions; fluctuations in exchange rates and oil price; and by the fact that the airline industry has experienced a general modification in its trends and structure. It can be concluded that the development of IT, on the one hand, by diminishing the importance of variables such as computer reservation systems, and the increasing significance of the effect of economic variables on the performance of organisations and companies, on the other, have brought about deep modifications in the methods that are used to estimate the performance of airline companies.

Duliba et al. (2001) argued that the use of market share and load factor is appropriate, although they are relative measures of performance because they are founded on an absolute measure of production. Both variables can also be viewed as indirect measures for maximising profit or as non-financial indicators. These studies considered each performance indicator as one measure, and performance indicators have been introduced separately in distinct models.",

The number of departures indicates the accessibility of an airline to its customers. Providing more departures normally results in better satisfaction and convenience for passengers. This, in turn, increases the attractiveness of the airline in the market. Average Stage Length (ASL) can simply be defined as the length flown divided by the number of departures (Doganis, 1991). This factor indicates the average length in miles, or kilometres, of an airline\u2019s flight between the departure point and destination, which can refer to two cities or routes, in the case of transit flights. The ASL measurement can result in better financial performance for a company. Advertising expenses can also be considered as a variable affecting the improvement of organisational performance, especially in the airline industry. This variable can contribute to improvement of market share among competitors. Aircraft kilometre is commonly used as a measure of air travel and is calculated by multiplying each weighted aircraft trip by the distance. High aircraft kilometre results in more market control and higher operating profits.",

This indicator has been used in airline research by Ramanathan (2001) in investigating the performance of the airline industry. GDP is an indicator of changes in the microeconomic environment and it is believed that when GDP increases, the number of people who travel increases accordingly because the environment is attractive to entrepreneurs starting out in business. Therefore, demand for air travel is generally based on GDP, although demand growth is faster than GDP (Hanlon, 2006). The inflation rate is another economic indicator that is commonly used to assess organisational performance. Bachis and Piga, 2006 suggested that the inflation rate can be used to predict airline ticket prices. Another indicator that was never used before in investigating airline performance but is included in this study is the Human Development Index (HDI). According to Avakov (2010), HDI is defined as the average of the level of income per capita in purchasing power parity, level of education and level of health care. High HDI indicates that people have a higher purchasing power and would travel more, thus improving airline performance.",

The main feature of SEM distinguishing it from other available models is its ability to allow researchers to incorporate both observed and latent variables into the process of the same analysis. As a result, the created incorporation provides a stronger analysis of the suggested model as well as a better evaluation of the study (Chin, 1998, Gefen et al., 2000). Furthermore, SEM has the ability to assist researchers in two additional ways, i.e., handling complicated data (with non-normality and multi collinearity) and the use of graphical interface modelling (Garson, 2007). A path analysis utilises a measurement model to confirm model fitting and verifies the reliability of the measurement indicators employed in the latent constructs.",

The estimate of squared multiple correlation exists between the latent variables and their measurements, for instance, the predictors of RPK are estimated to explain 88% of its variance.

Therefore, it can be confirmed that internal operation acts as a mediator in the relationship between economic situation and performance. This result provides support for the hypothesis in this research.",

Because this study involved data from multiple years, the median is calculated based on the average median firm age over the six years.

According to Arbuckle and Wothke, 1999, the critical ratio of an estimate pair tests the hypothesis is used to confirm the equality of the two parameters. This method is repeated to investigate possible moderating effects in the three relationships. According to the results presented in Table 8\n, there seems to be a significant difference in the relationship between internal operation and economic situation in both lower and higher firm age.

In other words, in higher age companies, the relationships among the three constructs of economic situation, internal operation and performance are significant, and internal operation acts as a mediator between the relationship of the economic situation and airline performance.

Without taking firm age into consideration, relationships between the three constructs are significant, proving that changes occurring in global airline performance depended on the economic situation and internal operation. In general, the effects of economic indicators on internal operation and airline performance are different between lower and higher age companies. For younger companies, the economic construct does not have a significant effect on the internal operation construct. This finding implies that economic situation has a direct impact on the performance of an airline. It also indicates that younger companies were not able to utilise information on the economic situation to come up with plans and actions to improve their performance. This is due to lack of established routines and processes that are needed to provide guidance in their strategic decision-making. For example, if a carrier changes the sets of routes served between two years, it reacted without changing operations (as measured in the paper). Older companies, on the other hand, have greater experience and knowledge in using information on the economic situation to change their strategies and react as quickly and flexibly as they would need to. In a way, companies with more years of experience can manage the impact of the economic situation by controlling internal operation. The findings of this study proved this phenomenon when the relationships among economic situation, internal operation and performance are significant and internal operation acts as a mediator between the relationship of economic situation and airline performance.",

            "text": "As with all research, this study does have its limitations. The first limitation is the exclusion of a few important factors such as subsidy, customer satisfaction and ticket price. A subsidy is financial support given to some airline companies by their governments (Bhadra, 2009). The subsidy given by the government allows companies to give discounts to the ticket price for certain air travellers and has the potential to increase the load factor (Jenatabadi and Ismail, 2007). This indicator was excluded due to the absence of such data in the annual report. Information on customer satisfaction and top management teams are also not available in the annual report and therefore are excluded from the study. Another important variable is ticket price, and it has been used in performance (Duliba et al., 2001), price (Mantin and Koo, 2009, Oliveira and Huse, 2009, Gaggero and Piga, 2010, Wan et al., 2009), and Choice modelling (Rose et al., 2012, Rose et al., 2005b, Rose et al., 2005a, Bliemer and Rose, 2011) of airline companies. For airline performance modelling, this indicator is suitable for the city pair level and not at the industrial level. For this reason, ticket price is also excluded from our research model. A further limitation is because data were only collected in the Asia Pacific region; therefore, the findings cannot be generalised to all airlines in the world.",
