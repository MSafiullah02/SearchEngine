We report 12 patients involved in a family transmission of SARS-CoV-2 which may address the importance of reducing crowds or gatherings to intercept the transmission chain. SARS-CoV-2 has broke out across China in a tremendous scale ever since late December, 2019. Nevertheless, China seem to be alleviated a lot through effective control. Three quarters of the Covid-19 patients in China have been associated with Wuhan (2) and family clusters of infected individuals have been reported(3). If the close contacts of infected patients are not properly quarantined and monitored, numerous chains of transmission will be multiplied and result in a terrible condition(4). According to the information provided by the Infection Department of Changyuan People's Hospital, we have figured out a typical familial cluster due to an imported case from the area outside of Wuhan. The complete timeline of the contacts, symptoms and laboratory findings of the two families are illustrated clearly in the figure and all patients have tested negative twice for SARS-CoV-2 before we wrote this paper. The index patient flew back from Hangzhou on January 23, 2020 and interacted with the first family. Through the contact tracing of the whole family, she turned out to be the one who spread the virus to the other seven in her incubation period as tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on February 3, but it remained unclear how she got infected. The first family held reunions twice on the second day of her arrival and three days later respectively and lasted for two hours each time.Patient 2 was the first one who developed fever and cough, then followed by Patient 1 who were febrile with nausea and myalgia two days before extensive gross glass-like radiological changes identified in chest CT. Patient 3 showed similar symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 like imaging abnormalities detected just as patient 2 did.",
