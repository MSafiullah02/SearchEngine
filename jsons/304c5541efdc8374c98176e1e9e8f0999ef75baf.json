Using a discrete-time likelihood model, the authors estimated the transmission probability per contact for each day following the onset of symptoms. The results suggested that there may be two peaks in the probability of SARS transmission, the first occurring around day 2 after symptom onset and the second occurring approximately 10 days after symptom onset. Index patients who were aged 60 years or older or whose lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated upon admission to the hospital (indicating higher viral loads) were more likely to transmit SARS to their contacts. There was little variation in the daily transmission probabilities before versus after the introduction of public health interventions on or around March 26, 2003.

DISCUSSION Previous efforts have been made to estimate the time course of infectiousness for SARS by examining the generation of secondary cases in mainland China (14) and Singapore (2) and by measuring temporal variation in viral load in prospectively identified cases from Hong Kong under the assumption that viral load is proportional to infectiousness (7). The results from these studies suggest that there is a single peak in infectiousness occurring approxi-mately 7-10 days after symptom onset, with relatively little transmission occurring prior to 5 days post-symptom-onset. While the results of the present analysis support previous findings that an increase in infectiousness occurs approximately 1 week after symptom onset, they suggest that there may also be an early peak in transmission, with a number of contacts being infected soon after symptom onset in the index case(s). A Bayesian transmission model was used to infer ''individual infectivity profiles'' over the course of SARS infection in China (14) . Variability in the infectivity of SARS cases was modeled using a gamma distribution, which was found to provide the best fit to the data compared with models which assumed that the transmission probability was constant or proportional to viral load. The estimated infectivity peaked on day 9 following symptom onset (14) , similar to the timing of the second peak seen in our analysis.

Previous studies found similar household member attack rates in the two countries (12, 15) . However, the analysis from Singapore included both hospital-and communitybased exposures. Time from symptom onset to isolation declined markedly over the course of the Singapore epidemic (2) , so the association between long time-to-isolation and transmission to secondary cases would have been strongly confounded by any other control measures, including those for nonhousehold transmission, that became more effective over time. Primary-case patients who were isolated 5 or more days after symptom onset may have been the major contributors to nosocomial transmission-which accounted for 76 percent of SARS infections in Singapore (16)-either because such cases tended to occur earlier in the epidemic when hospitals had yet to institute a policy of isolation for SARS patients (2) or because such patients had a less severe clinical presentation and thus hospital employees adopted fewer precautions upon their admission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 174, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "(12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 548, "end": 551, "text": "15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 741, "end": 744, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 449, "end": 458, "text": "(table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Sensitivity analysis: effect of heterogeneity in simulated data"}, {"text": "The results of our analysis also seem to be inconsistent with the viral shedding data for 14 patients from the Amoy Gardens housing estate (7) .
