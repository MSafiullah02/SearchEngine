In the first case, the patient had high levels of inflammatory markers and poor respiratory function, which are indications for the use of tocilizumab [1] , and was treated with ruxolitinib 7 weeks after first symptoms (the patient had received tocilizumab up until the week before).

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of a nasal swab confirmed SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection at hospital admission. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation, enoxaparin 6000 IU and lopinavir 200 mg/ritonavir 50 mg two times per day, and dexamethasone 20 mg and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg per day. The patient had persistent deterioration; therefore, after 5 weeks of hospitalization, he received 2 subcutaneous injections per 2 cycles a week of tocilizumab 162 mg and showed subsequent clinical and radiological improvement.",
