            "text": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a fatal hyper-inflammatory syndrome induced by aggressive activation of macrophages and cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, resulting in hypercytokinemia and immune-mediated injury of multiple organ systems [1]. Clinical and laboratory features include fever, splenomegaly, neurological dysfunction, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, cytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, hemophagocytosis, and diminished NK cell activity [2]. HLH is often classified as primary or as secondary. Primary HLH, accompanied by genetic mutations and poor prognosis, is most common in children. Secondary HLH is usually triggered by medical conditions, including infections, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and immunodeficient states. Among infectious diseases, secondary HLH is commonly induced by viral infections, such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infection. Occasionally, it is associated with bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections. HLH is a rare and severe complication of tuberculosis (TB), with approximately 3% morbidity and 50% mortality [3]. Normally, previous TB-HLH cases were treated with anti-TB therapy. In some situation, the patients need more aggressive management. Herein, we present a patient who was confirmed to be Mycobacterium infection, or rather, highly suspected TB induced HLH, with a favorable outcome following early administration of anti-TB therapy combined with etoposide.",

Additional blood tests showed low NK cell activity (11.9%, normal value: \u226515.1%) and high-soluble CD25 levels (> 44,000 pg/ml, normal value: < 2400 pg/ml). Accordingly, a diagnosis of HLH was made. However, the patient refused to undergo genetic testing. Following consultation with a hematologist, intravenous etoposide was started on day 7 (0.1 g twice a week for 2 weeks, 0.1 g once a week for the following 6 weeks).

            "text": "Although viruses are the most frequent trigger in infection-associated HLH, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can act as an obligate intracellular pathogen. The underlying mechanism of TB-associated HLH remains to be elucidated. In China, TB is a serious public health issue, with the second highest incidence rate in the world. However, it is not easy to establish the diagnosis due to its diverse clinical manifestations, low sensitivity for acid-fast staining, and time-consuming culture. Polymerase chain reaction of peripheral blood or sputum has become an attractive diagnostic tool because of its high sensitivity. However, it is unavailable in our hospital. According to the patient\u2019s radiological features and positive TB ELISPOT results, empirical anti-TB therapy was instituted. Given the low platelet counts, invasive procedures were not carried out at this time. After improvement of cytopenia, lung biopsy was performed, and the final pathological result suggested possible MTB or NTM infections. In a review of the literature of cases of HLH, there were no reports of HLH associated with NTM infection. Since lacking of enough etiology evidences focused on TB, the diagnosis of Mycobacterium infection was established. Nevertheless, we proposed that HLH was most likely to be secondary to TB in our patient. He underwent a course of rigorous anti-TB therapeutic regimen. Chest infiltration markedly improved and fibrous proliferation, calcification was observed in repeated CT features. According to medical image diagnostic report in another tertiary hospital, TB infection was still highly considered. It was generally known that the first line anti-TB drugs without combination of other antibiotics, such as clarithromycin or amikacin, was not sufficient for treatment of NTM infection.",

            "text": "HLH is known as a rare hematological syndrome with acute onset and poor prognosis with clinical deterioration of the condition. It is treated with immunosuppressants, etoposide, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. EBV-HLH carries nearly 100% mortality in untreated cases. In contrast, in the patients with TB-HLH who do not receive any treatment or delayed treatment, the mortality is approximately 50%. However, most information on the treatment of HLH comes from the pediatric literature. No prospective trials guiding the first-line treatment of HLH in adults have taken place. Treatment regimens targeting hyper-inflammation are therefore based on pediatric protocols, such as HLH-94 and HLH-2004, which may result in over-treatment and unnecessary toxicity in adults [4]. With regard to TB-HLH, it normally depends on successfully treating TB alone. There is no doubt that rapid anti-TB therapy is the cornerstone of treatment and is crucial for preventing HLH in TB patients. In some situations, patients require immunomodulatory therapy, including steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Most previous TB-HLH cases were treated with anti-TB therapy with or without steroids [5]. Our patient experienced rapid deterioration and required more intensive management. Anti-TB therapy alone seemed to be ineffective, since he had recurrent dyspnea, high-grade fever and cytopenia in the course of treatment. Moreover, we considered that HLH may have been another driver, together with TB, of the patient\u2019s worsening condition. In such circumstances, prompt introduction of etoposide was recommended after consultation with an expert experienced in the treatment of HLH. In addition, dexamethasone was not used in this patient, since it is supposed to cause aggravation of potential infections.",

In contrast, Aggarwal reported a patient who died 2 weeks after use of steroid, etoposide and cyclosporine [6]. Etoposide, a classical chemotherapeutic agent in HLH-94 and HLH-04 treatment protocol, is generally believed to specifically inhibit the activation of the monocyte\u2013macrophage system by ablating overactivation of T cells and suppressing production of inflammatory cytokines [7]. This differs from the wide immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids and immunoregulation of IVIG. Initiation of etoposide is effective in severe EBV-infected or HIV-infected patients with HLH, but is less well known in other forms of infection-associated HLH. Meanwhile, it is usually not indicated in HLH induced by TB [4].",
