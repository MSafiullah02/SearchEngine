Soviet-era tracks in Kazakhstan ended at Aktogay, 340 km west of the Sino-Kazakh border, and 320 km west of Druzhba, Kazakhstan's eastern most township. Fashioning a rail link via Kazakhstan required new tracks on both sides. In 1954, Moscow and Beijing agreed to lay these. China offered to build the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Alashankou line, bringing its railhead to the Kazakh border. The allies decided to construct the Urumqi-Aktogay section in 1956, and Moscow completed the Aktogay-Druzhba section in 1959. When completed, these linked sections would enable rail transport from China's Pacific coast to Baltic ports. However, Sino-Soviet relations chilled in 1959 and the alliance turned adversarial. China completed the Lanzhou-Urumqi extension in 1962 but suspended work on the Urumqi-Alashankou section.",

When Sino-Soviet relations thawed in 1985, Beijing revived the Urumqi-Alashankou section, completing construction in 1990. In mid-September, the Chinese and Soviet rail networks were linked up at Druzhba. Freight trains began running in July 1991 and, in June 1992, after the Soviet collapse, China and Kazakhstan launched an Urumqi-Almaty passenger service. As Central Asian states expanded their rail networks around Soviet-era tracks, it became feasible to start from China's Lianyungang harbour, travel 11,000 km westward and reach Rotterdam, Europe's largest port. For several years, trains ran between Urumqi and Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, via Almaty. However, by late 2000, given low demand, services were reduced to just two weekly return trips between Urumqi and Almaty. Chinese and Kazakh railways shared responsibility for running these Zhibek Zholy, or Silk Road, trains.",

In 1992, the Presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan visited Beijing; in November 1992, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen travelled to these states and Russia. In 1993, the Presidents of Tajikistan and Turkmenistan visited China. These exchanges laid the foundations for China-Central Asian engagement. Deepening concerns over economic divides fracturing China reinforced Beijing's diplomacy. In late 1993, the State Council announced plans to develop 'the regions along the Eurasian Continental Bridge', aiming to narrow the gulf between China's fast-growing coastal belt and the underdeveloped hinterland, as parallel plans to connect China to the rest of Eurasia gelled. 22 In April 1994, Premier Li Peng visited Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, propounding principles, objectives and processes guiding Sino-Central Asian relations: mutually beneficial economic and diversified cooperation, prosperity via shared use of natural resources, improvement of communications and transport infrastructure, offers of Chinese aid, peaceful coexistence, non-interference in internal affairs and respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. 23 Li's commercial focus was manifested in the delegation of SOE executives accompanying him. While addressing the Uzbek parliament in Tashkent on 19 April, Li proposed to found Sino-Central Asian relations on stable ties, economic cooperation and non-interference, symbolised by mutually beneficial collaboration along a 'New Silk Road'. He was the first Chinese leader in the modern era to proclaim, 'the People's Republic of China is now willing to work to build a new Silk Road'. 24 SOE leaders signed four agreements, two contracts and around 20 letters of intent on cooperation in petroleum, natural gas, metallurgy, electronics, textiles, construction and other industries. 25 Through the 1990s, as Eurasia evolved, security, stability and economic cooperation remained the leitmotif of Beijing's diplomacy. A NATOaffiliated assessment identified two motivations driving it: the quest for new energy sources to fuel China's booming economy, and expanding land access westward 'in order to reduce the economic dependence on coastal maritime commerce'. 26 Beijing engaged with all five Stans but, given its political-economic stature, the length of its border with China, its scientific-technical progress and policy-proximity to Moscow, Kazakhstan received most attention, shaping China's policy.",

In 1990, the cross-border line reached Aktogay, joining Soviet-era tracks running southwest to Kazakhstan's old capital, Almaty. From there, it ran westward for about 1000 km before crossing into Uzbekistan, reaching its capital, Tashkent, Central Asia's largest city and a trading hub on the ancient Silk Road. From Tashkent, the line ran westward for 350 km, to another fabled Silk Road market city, Samarkand. From there, 1,000 km west, it reached Turkmenistan's capital, Asgabad. Before Asgabad, a spur line branched off at Tedzhen, heading south to Sarakhs on the Iranian border. In 1996, a newly built 100 km line joined Sarakhs to Mashhad, allowing train travel from China to Tehran and then, via Sirjan, to Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf, giving Central Asian economies maritime access for the first time.

Consolidating cooperative experience, in June 2001, the 'Shanghai Five' signed the 'Shanghai Convention on Fighting Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism', proclaimed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and welcomed Uzbekistan as a member.

It involved about 6000 troops, over 1000 combat vehicles and dozens of aircraft far from home 'fighting' week-long 'operations'. 50 All six SCO presidents, after concluding their annual summit in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, travelled to Chebarkul in Western Siberia, to review the drills' final stages.

            "text": "Insecurity drove coherence. The Shanghai Five's July 2000 Dushanbe Statement underscored a determination to not only counter separatism or 'liberation movements', terrorism and extremism, but also 'oppose intervention in other countries' internal affairs' on the pretexts of 'humanitarianism' and 'protecting human rights' and support the efforts of one another 'in safeguarding the five countries' national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and social stability.' 51 US observers noted the potential use China or Russia might make of the SCO to counteract the US post-Soviet pre-eminence. Some described Jiang Zemin's remarks: ' We should strengthen mutual support in safeguarding the national unity and sovereignty of our nations and resist all kinds of threat to the security of the region', and the SCO's opposition to the 'use of force or threat of force in international relations without the UNSC's prior approval and\u2026any countries or group of countries' attempt to monopolise global and regional affairs out of selfish interests', as challenging the USA in Asia. 52 US bases in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan underscored close security ties, but the former's 'colour revolution' and the latter's 'Andijan incident' in 2005 transformed perceptions. That year's SCO summit urged Washington to specify its base withdrawal timeframe while Sino-Russian Peace Mission 2005 drills deepened collaboration. Two years later, Washington's top diplomat for Central Asia described the SCO as 'a subject that seems to make a lot of Americans' blood just boil'. 53 Events partly explained US outrage. Just before the Shanghai Five became the SCO, Sino-US relations plunged over the collision between a US EP-3E Aries ISR aircraft and a PLANAF J-8II interceptor 70 miles from China's Hainan Island. The J-8II crashed, killing the pilot. The damaged EP-3E made an 'unauthorised' landing at a PLA airfield on Hainan, its 24-strong crew being detained for 11 days. A bushfire of anti-US anger spreading across China triggered the George W. Bush Administration's first 'China-crisis'. 54 Contradictory narratives mirroring conflicting interpretations of international maritime law exposed fundamental divergences in US and Chinese perspectives, claims and interests. USN and NSA investigations concluded that Beijing had obtained 'large volumes' of 'technical data' and 'sensitive COMINT (communications intelligence) equipment' from the damaged EP-3E. 55 The crisis, eventually diplomatically resolved, nonetheless exacerbated mutual mistrust. While US anger at Chinese 'assertiveness' was understandable, scrutiny suggested outrage was misplaced. Towards the end of Hu's tenure, with international relations gaining focus in Hu's second term, his platitudinous formulation, 'Major powers are the key; surrounding/peripheral regions are the first priority; developing countries are the foundation, and multilateral fora are the important stage', 56 reflected and explained Beijing's largely defensive Eurasian outreach and shaped the continuity in Chinese diplomacy under Hu's successors.",

Russia's key role has been analysed elsewhere. 62 The changing trajectory of Central Asia's trade relations underscored the pattern. By 2016, Russia's $18bn commerce with the five Stans was dwarfed by China's $30bn. 63 Investments followed a similar pattern. Kazakhstan, by far the largest Central Asian economy, reflected the shift in the China-Central Asia-Russia dynamic. During 2013-2018, Astana and Beijing agreed on the construction or completion of 127 BRI projects worth $67bn, although implementation was uneven. The most visible ones included a $1.9bn light railway system in Astana, and a $600m, five-year transport infrastructure plan covering Kazakhstan's other areas. In 2018, Kazakhstan's debt to China crossed $12.3bn. 64 Another impetus to Beijing's westward drive came from the vulnerability of the explosive expansion of its maritime trade, especially growing energy imports powering its economy, to interdiction by US and allied fleets deployed along Southeast Asian choke points, i.e. China's 'Malacca Dilemma'. Dependence on shipping through the Malacca and Lombok/Makassar straits explained Beijing's concerns. The shortest link between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, stretching north from Singapore between the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, the Malacca Strait was one of the world's busiest 'choke points'. The deeper Lombok/Makassar Strait between Indonesian islands of Lombok and Bali, used by Very Large Crude Carriers, too, mattered to China's crucial energy supplies.",

In fact, this ratio reached 80% by 2012. 66 Despite slowing growth, China imported 440m metric tons of crude and 125bcm of gas, marking year-on-year increases of 11% and 31.7%, respectively, in 2018, with import-dependence of 69.8% and 45.3%, respectively. 67 Beijing feared that in a crisis, hostile US and allied naval fleets, controlling the choke points, could cut off energy supplies to strangulate China, holding its economy to ransom. Beijing lacked the ability to defend its vital sea lines of communications (SLoC), but boosting its forces appropriately could trigger hostile pre-emption; hence the 'dilemma'.",

In 2001-2002, another $45.5bn helped to speed up western development: local governments received $37.1bn in subsidies; $8.4bn went into building infrastructure.

            "text": "State consolidation may have informed Beijing's Western Development Strategy, but rising inequality and its socio-political consequences did deepen elite anxiety. Deng was aware of income variations inherent in capitalist modes of production resulting from varied levels of risks, uncertainty and individual responses, particularly in societies used to the levelling comforts of statist, egalitarian, distributive regimes, 82 but believed distribution could follow accumulation. Western critique rested on GDP and GDP growth per capita in the rapidly marketising China. However, per capita calculations ignored distortions caused by China's hukou residential registration regime. Millions of marginal farmers and unemployed youth, registered residents of underdeveloped regions, flocked to coastal cities looking for jobs, providing the labour which gave China comparative advantages in export manufacturing, built shiny new districts enabling coastal urbanisation and generated personal/family income and national wealth. But hukou-regulations, skewing distributive data, injected inaccuracies. 83 Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, succeeding Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji in November 2002, built on their policy-inheritance. In 2003, Wen launched a 'Revitalise 79 CIFIT Secretariat (2018) . 80 Report (2002). 81 Report (2001a, p. i). 82 Li et al. (2012b) and Drysdale (2012) . 83 Gibson (2012) and Plummer (2012) . the Old Northeast Industrial Bases' plan covering Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces and five eastern prefectures of Inner Mongolia. In March 2004, Wen proclaimed before the NPC the 'Rise of Central China Plan', focusing resources on hinterland areas closest to the coastal belt, considered better able to absorb investment: 'Accelerating the development of Central China is an important aspect of our endeavours to ensure well-balanced development of regional economies'. 84 The plan targeted Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Shanxi Provinces. Together, the strategy and the plan would mitigate well analysed intra-PRC inequality. The NDRC, in drafting the 11th FYP (2006-2010), adopted Hu's theoretical approach to building China's future: scientific development. By applying advanced science and technology, this approach would help to achieve high-quality, highly efficient and sustainable development, securing the goal, i.e. a harmonious society. The NDRC set new priorities to focus leadership efforts and resources on developing the Yangtze River Delta, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, 'the old industrial base' in northeast China, and Chengdu-Chongqing. The latter belt would power the central region, enabling it to assist western development. 85 Concern over inter-regional disharmony informed policy-discourse, shaping the FYP drafting process. Over 1978-2008, China's GDP increased nearly 17 times, and per capita GDP 12-fold. Outside a handful of coastal provinces, however, growth faltered. The average income in Central and Western China reached 77% of the national average in 1999, inching up to just 80% in 2008. 86 Iniquity may not have been the principal trigger behind rapidly rising 'mass group incidents'-large-scale protests, i.e. sit-ins, strikes, group petitions, rallies, demonstrations, marches, traffic blocking and building seizures, public melees, rioting and inter-ethnic strife, but central planners considered these a key contributor. Official figures showed 'mass incidents' rose from 8700 in 1993 to 32,000 in 1999, 50,000 in 2002, surpassing 58,000 in 2003, 90,000 in 2006 and an unconfirmed 127,000 in 2008, when Beijing stopped publishing strife data. 87 Opacity over the incidents' scale, nature and triggers rendered causal connections conjectural. Economic triggers cut across ethnic divisions, and ethnic violence was rarely amenable to economic solutions. One study of certain categories of 'mass incidents' rocking China during 2003-2009, for instance, found that the highest frequency, 54, occurred in Guangdong, one of China's most prosperous provinces, and the lowest, 1, occurred in Jilin, Qinghai and Tibet, the last two among the poorest. 88 Societies experiencing rapid change, with dramatic asset growth for some, juxtaposed with slower accumulation or little for many, via a sharp transition from state-protected equality to state-authorised uneven protection, often betrayed angry despair. 89 China's single-party rule with loosened economic levers contrasting with 84 Wen (2004) . 85 Ma (2006) and Information Office (2005). 86 Huang et al.

Differences deeply affected Lamaist-Buddhist Tibetans in Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan, and Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. Mutually reinforcing ethno-cultural, political and economic tensions flowing from unresolved grievances exploded in Tibet in 2008 and Xinjiang in 2009.

Beijing swiftly incorporated Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan into its Tibet Development Plan. To drive Xinjiang's growth, the Muslim majority trade centre of Kashgar/Kashi was designated a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). China also engaged with Turkey, the Turkic-speaking Uighurs 'cultural homeland', attenuating any tacit Turkish endorsement of Uighur irredentism. Tibetans, with their iconic leader, the Dalai Lama, still symbolising 'splittism' from India, seemed less persuaded. 95 Presiding over a PBSC meeting in late May 2010, Hu Jintao assigned greater import to Western Development Strategy implementation. The PBSC noted, 'the Western part of the nation is strategically important and there should be special policies to support the region'. Support should be 'increased with greater resolution and force'. In addition to infrastructure building, water conservancy and natural resources-based industrialisation, now education, technological innovation, health care, employment, social security and cultural development gained salience. The PBSC also ordered developing 'old revolutionary bases in poor, ethnic and border regions', as 'ethnic and religious harmony is important to the region's stability'. 96 Five weeks later, marking the Strategy's 10th anniversary, Hu and Wen addressed heads of implementing ministries and agencies at a 'work meeting on developing Western China'. Although much had been done, Hu worried that 'the development gap between eastern and western regions remains broad, and the west is still a conundrum for the country's endeavour in building an overall moderately prosperous society'. Slamming poor execution, Wen urged 'serious and good implementation of all the policies and measures' adopted by Beijing. He asked that the region's resources be utilised to develop 'modern' and environmentally friendly industries, while advancing agricultural and tertiary sectors. He pledged 'vigorous efforts in social development' enabling western compatriots to 'share in the fruits of national economic progress'. Wen vowed to focus Beijing's poverty alleviation efforts on southern Xinjiang, eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Western Yunnan Province. 97 Given the strategy's rising profile in elite calculus, urgency flowing from the Great Recession's impact and growing social disharmony, Beijing invited neighbouring states and potential overseas partners to help develop Western China and fashion terrestrial connectivity binding Central and Western China, Eurasia and Europe. engagement. Wen's message: Beijing encouraged 'the Western Region to expand exchange and cooperation with these countries'. 99 Wen briefed foreign leaders on the Strategy's goals: 'changing the backward outlook of Western China, building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, improving national land development pattern, promoting balanced regional development, expanding the scope of opening up both internally and externally, and fostering new economic growth areas'. In the first decade, Beijing provided over RMB 3.5tn in 'transfer payment and special subsidies', earmarking over RMB 730bn for the region's 'construction projects'. In 2000-2008, the west's GDP grew at an annual average of 11.7% from RMB 1.66tn to RMB 5.82tn. Revenues rose at 19.6%, and fixed asset investment, by 22.9%, exceeding national averages. During 1999-2008, urban and rural per capita disposable income grew by 105% and 74%, respectively, with 9.54m rural poor crossing the poverty threshold. Western China's highway mileage increased by over 888,000 km, and railway track length, by over 8,000 km. Regional airports now numbered 79, nearly half of China's total. Landmark projects like the Qinghai-Tibet railway, west to east gas transmission line and west to east electricity transmission grid, became operational.",

Energy cooperation being 'very important to the development of Sino-Kazakh relations, we agreed to continue expanding and deepening energy cooperation. To reinforce cooperation on oil and gas, we will ensure the smooth construction of several oil and gas pipelines'. 103 New motorways, expanded border trade facilities and reduced regulatory bureaucratic impediments eased economic integration. The process would mature by the end of China's 12th FYP (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . The NDRC, leading the FYP drafting effort, stressed substituting export dependence with domestic consumption, accelerating service sector growth and establishing capacity quotas for 'new energy' sources, i.e. nuclear, hydro, solar and wind. Abandoning past emphases on infrastructure-building and industrialisation in the strategy's previous iterations, planners now sought 'more balanced growth' between developed and poorer regions. 104 The State Council approved the NDRC's draft 12th FYP for further promoting the economy of the Western Regions, i.e. Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Yunnan and Chongqing, in February 2011. The plan emphasised building 'key economic regions', promoting agricultural production of 'main areas', sustainable development of key 'ecological zones', intensive development of resource-rich areas, hastening completion of 'border development zones' and 'leap-forward development' of areas with 'special difficulties'. Noting, 'infrastructure construction is the main guarantee to the western development', planners organised the region into 11 zones 105 : Western China, as a connectivity hub, would link Northeast Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia. New railway lines joining Chongqing, Lanzhou, Urumqi, Guilin and Guangzhou would knit Xinjiang closer to eastern China, enabling Chengdu, Xian, Lanzhou, Urumqi and Kunming to 'serve as major container stations for goods criss-crossing their way across Asia'. 107 Phase II of the China-Kazakhstan crude oil pipeline, the Dushanzi-Urumqi pipeline, the Jiaopiao-Ruili-Kunming section of the China-Myanmar crude oil pipeline and sub-sections of the Kunming-Chongqing pipeline would either be completed or brought near completion. Provinces would industrialise by processing mineral and other resources for producing energy, petrochemicals and fertilisers. By 2015, Western China would drive Beijing's terrestrial economic outreach.",

Wang was taken into custody after a night spent at the Consulate. His testimony and further investigations led to the arrest of Bo and his wife, Gu Kailai, the latter in connection with the late 2011 murder of a British business associate, Neil Heywood. After confessing, Gu received a life term. Bo, convicted of abuse of power, bribery and corruption, 113 too, received a life sentence.

Since 2010, NDRC economists had worked with WBG colleagues, examining the trajectory of China's post-1978 'reform and opening-up' progress. Diagnosing looming challenges, they recommended further reforms. This NDRC-WBG report, 'China 2030: Building a Modern, Harmonious, and Creative Society', launched in 2013, charted the pathway guiding Beijing's economic future. 115 The framework, enabling China to overcome myriad pitfalls precipitated by three decades of breakneck growth, directed Beijing's economic vectors towards its two centenary goals.

However, railway construction, water resources management, and energy-saving and ecological protection targets were not. The NDRC refined the plan stressing infrastructure building, urbanisation and environmental protection. Beijing would 'push forward the construction of railway, highway and water projects', while also addressing transport and water supply issues.

Unstable governments, poor governance, uncertain financial management and incompetent oversight posed potential risks. With maritime shipping still cheaper, if slower, than rail freight, and rail containers carrying Chinese exports to Europe often returning empty, challenged SREB's commercial merit and prospects. 126 Meaningful cost-benefit analyses would take longer but the experience of SREB's longitudinal spurs offered insights into the ground reality. Conceived in 1954 as PRC-USSR railway tie-ups, by 2018, SREB became a 'Eurasian Continental Land Bridge' connecting China to Europe. By the end of June 2018, trains making the China-Europe run in both directions had made over 9000 trips. However, as some Chinese cities and provinces sought to take advantage of government subsidies, many trains carried several empty containers to make up the numbers. 127 In the seas, the MSR linked Coastal China to Eastern Africa and South-Western Europe via ports, airports and industrial hubs along the shores of the SCS and the Indian Ocean. Trade between China and its BRI partners reached $664bn in the first seven months of 2018, up 11.3% year-on-year, exceeding a quarter of China's total foreign trade. 128 In July-September 2018, BRI trade grew 20.1% year-on-year to $332bn, with Chinese exports reaching $182bn and imports, $150.5bn. 129 Aggregate trade between China and other BRI partners in 2013-2018 reached $6.47tn. In these five years, more than 80 'economic and trade cooperation zones' were built in various BRI partner states and over 244,000 jobs had been created for non-Chinese locals. 130 Estimates for 2019 suggested China's exports to BRI states could increase by $56bn and its imports from them rise by $61bn. 131 In the first half of 2019, China's actual trade with BRI partners hit $617.5bn, an increase of 9.7% year-on-year, compared to overall trade growth of 3.9% during the same period. 132 Long before Xi's twin proposals, however, partner states had initiated north-south 'economic corridors' designed to integrate Eurasia and its maritime periphery, corridors that now connected the SREB and MSR alignments. One unheralded SREB/MSR spur, the China-Singapore Connectivity Initiative (CCI), showed how some projects steadily progressed while others stalled. Launched in 2017, CCI was designed to link Chongqing to Singapore, reduce shipping distances by 1000 km and slash cargo voyages by 12 days. An unstated aim was to bypass the Malacca Strait choke point.",

The plan indicated coalescing convergence. 148 LMC institutionalised consultation and joint management of political-security issues, economic and sustainable developmental activities and sociocultural and people to people exchanges. Chinese funding, technical support and training and investment incentivised collaboration; voluntary, consensual decision making offered leverage to LMC's weaker members. The first Chinese-funded LMC projects were in Cambodia and Laos. In late 2017, using Chinese designs and hardware, Thailand began building a high-speed railway linking Bangkok to Nong Khai on the Lao border. The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge over the Mekong beckoned to Vientiane 25 km upriver, as the first phase of a regional connectivity project. 149 The LMC's 'foundation-laying stage' (2018-2019) would be followed by an 'expansion stage' (2020-2022), with Beijing initially funding 132 projects. Several, e.g. the Kunming-Bangkok road, China-Laos railway, and Vietnam's Long Jiang Industrial Park, were listed in BRI portfolios; others could follow. This first Chinesebuilt sub-regional cooperative institution offered templates for others. Progress from initial proposal in November 2014 to formal launch of the 2018-2022 FYP in January 2018 was rapid, 150 but trans-frontier collaboration across the 'Greater Mekong Subregion' (GMS) went back decades. Historically inhabited by four loosely related ethnic-Dai principalities, the Lancang-Mekong basin below Tibetan highlands was incorporated into China (Yunnan), Thailand, Myanmar and Laos. As frontiersland troubled by ethnic conflicts fuelled by drug-financed warlordism, the GMS was a volatile cockpit of interstate intrigue and security operations. In 1957, ESCAP proposed a Mekong Committee to drive regional development, 151 but Cold War era political challenges thwarted action.",

Beginning in 1992, the six neighbours, reviving the Mekong Committee's GMS Economic Cooperation Programme, met repeatedly to coordinate infrastructure development and investment plans. They asked the ADB to be the programme's Secretariat, precipitating an 'economic quadrangle', integrating a market of 50m populating 600,000 km 2 in the Mekong basin. 153 In May 1993, the Governor of Yunnan proclaimed a 'Lancang Economic Belt' spanning GMS neighbours, with mining operations in the basin's mountainous upper sections, hydro-power and timber-processing projects in the middle sections, and the lower sections open to international river traffic. This coincided with a joint field survey by specialists from China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand and Premier Li Peng's presence when the Governor made his 'Kunming proclamation'. Yunnan's provincial administrators took this leadership-level endorsement as the start of a drive to build new transport networks from Kunming across the Mekong basin southward to the sea. 154 China promoted GMS/LMC trade links as mutually beneficial 'South-South' engagement because Yunnan's transport links to coastal China could only handle half of the province's coal and phosphates output. Access to foreign markets via LMC ports would help while meeting regional developmental needs, but connectivity required concerted effort. 155 Pressure for such cooperation grew when the USSR and Soviet-bloc states suddenly dissolved, forcing Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to seek new trade partners. In December 1993, a Sino-Lao border treaty was signed; a Lao-Myanmar accord was concluded in October 1995, enabling formal boosting of infrastructure development and trans-frontier trade, including riverine commerce.",

Years of track-2, track-1.5 and, finally, track-1 engagement, aimed at linking Kunming to Kolkata (K2K) via road, rail and riverine transport networks binding Myanmar and Bangladesh to India and China failed to deliver. The K2K vision grew around a 2800 km road alignment from Kunming via Dali, Tengchong and Ruili (China), Mandalay and Ka Lay (Myanmar) Imphal (India), Tamabil (Bangladesh), Silchar (India), Dhaka and Jessore (Bangladesh), to Kolkata. 158 Xi Jinping secured Narendra Modi's endorsement of the BCIM blueprint during Xi's September 2014 state visit to India, where he pledged to invest $20bn in India's economy and infrastructure over five years. That visit followed the first meeting of the BCIM Joint Study Group (JSG) in Kunming and the two leaders pledged to 'continue their respective efforts to implement understandings reached at the meeting'. 159 At the JSG's second session in November 2014 in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, delegates assigned each country to 'synthesise' specific 'chapters' of the BCIM framework document; that is where it stood. The vision appeared reasonable. BCIM represented 40% of humanity occupying 9% of Earth's landmass. The population of just Yunnan, Northeast India, Myanmar and Bangladesh totalled 440m. However, intra-BCIM trade in 2005 stood at 7.99% of world trade and, although it grew, in 2012, it was just 5% of total BCIM trade. This compared to ASEAN's intra-regional trade representing 35% of the group's total trade. Upgrading 312 km of the 1940s era Ledo-Kunming road linking North-Eastern India to Yunnan via Northern Myanmar could boost trade by reducing Sino-Indian transportation costs by 30%. 160 Notwithstanding acknowledged potential, summit-level pledges, and track-1.5 proclamations, BCIM remained 'comatose' until 2017, when discussions were elevated to an inter-governmental process. 161 Pre-existing Yunnan-Myanmar road and pipelines alignments to be shared between the BCIM and LMC ECs should have aided BCIM's central ambition: fashioning surface transport links. However, Sino-Indian divergences hobbled progress. At the third JSG session in Kolkata in April 2017, Bangladesh and Myanmar offered fresh proposals for moving forward, but the leader of the Indian Delegation insisted: 'We should be mindful of different domestic circumstances and development aspirations in our respective countries. While we focus on expanding trade volumes, equal attention should also be paid to its sustainability. Greater access to each other's markets is desirable to achieve more viable and sustainable trade cooperation in our region'. His Chinese counterpart, Vice-Chairman of the NDRC, urged concrete action: 'There is a need to put in place an Inter-Governmental Cooperation Mechanism for the success of the proposed initiative'. 162 His team had drafter the proposed outline of an 'Inter-Governmental Cooperation Mechanism', but facing Indian resistance, did not table it. Delhi's anxiety over BCIM potentially increasing Chinese exports, further widening trade imbalances, and the need to strictly control India's insurgency-prone border districts, imposed caution. The mismatch between Chinese, Bangladeshi and Myanmar enthusiasm and Indian reluctance, and BCIM's consensual underpinning, stalled progress. This explained Kunming's provincial-level initiatives.",

His aides signed deals with Chinese corporations offering to invest $945m in projects to be built in the largely rural and violence-afflicted state. 163 However, the biggest regional prize, visits by West Bengal's CM Mamata Banerjee, eluded Beijing. By January 2018, Chinese provinces had extended ten separate invitations to her, but she took up none.",

Chinese emphasis on BRI and BCIM for boosting Sino-Indian trade and investment drew no attention at the summit, reflecting profound unease afflicting Indian leaders, analysts and businessmen over both. China also participated in the February 2019 Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS), but was neither made a 'partner', nor received a mention in any of the summit's official reports. 166 Banerjee eventually agreed to visit Beijing and Shanghai in June 2018, but a failed demand to meet a PBSC member during the visit triggered a last-minute cancellation. 167 Prime Minister Modi's refusal to attend the 2017 BRF, and Delhi's official explanation, underscored concerns over 'territorial and sovereignty' issues. Those concerns were rooted in the CPEC's alignment across Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan region, which Delhi considered parts of disputed Jammu and Kashmir. However, Indian enthusiasm for any Chinese initiative, e.g. BRI and BCIM ('Kunming Initiative'), was limited. China had proposed K2K connectivity and the BCIM-EC at a GMS meeting in Kunming. Chinese officials hoped that in addition to road links passing through Mandalay in Myanmar and Sylhet in Bangladesh, BCIM could lay a parallel 2800 km K2K high-speed railway line benefiting all BCIM states. 168 With Myanmar straddling the LMC and BCIM alignments, both Myanmar and India could advance or hinder BCIM's implementation. This was the key obstacle to the process 169 which was begun by the YDRC shortly after the Soviet collapse transformed the planet's political-economic landscape.",

            "text": "Chinese planners had revived a 1959 vintage UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Far East (ESCAFE, later ESCAP) proposal for cooperative development by building road transport linkages. YDRC, the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences (YASS), the Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences and regional universities hosted several workshops in Kunming with academics, think tank analysts, journalists and businessmen from Eastern India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Organisers promoted synergistic development using trade and investment, linking South-Western China, Eastern India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Track-II exchanges socialised participants from diverse backgrounds, historically insulated from mutual exposure, crystallising a collective sub-regional vision of shared development potentially transforming a region marginalised by post-Cold War globalisation. After several sessions, YDRC consensually named the gatherings the Conference on Regional Cooperation and Development. 165 Despite this level of presence, the BGBS did not consider China as a 'partner country', a group comprising the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, RoK, UAE, Poland and UK. BGBS (2018); BGBS report https://bengalglobalsummit.com/ Accessed 26 Jan 2018. 166 Report (2019a), Rakshit and Dutt (2019) and Singh (2019) . 167 Chaudhury and Patranobis (2018) . 168 PTI (2015) . 169 Mishra (2011). In August 1999, Chinese and Myanmar officials attended the first BCIM gathering with academics, analysts, businessmen and journalists. Participants-94 from China, 22 from India, 13 from Bangladesh and four from Myanmar, launched the BCIM Economic Connectivity Forum for Regional Cooperation, or 'the Kunming Initiative', as a track-1.5 process. 170 Next, YDRC and the Yunnan government established the 'China Kunming International Logistics & Finance Association' (ILFA) to facilitate connectivity, trade and investment among states in Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). ILFA would aid infrastructure projects, especially roads, land and sea ports, industrial parks and free-trade zones. 171 BCIM aimed to develop economic growth and connectivity via transport infrastructure, energy resources, agriculture and trade and investment. 172 Three Delhibased official think tanks, as counterparts to the YDRC and its academic partners, hosted the second BCIM Conference on Regional Cooperation in December 2000. Participants cheered at the screening of a documentary on the 769 km Ledo-Kunming Road which linked Arunachal Pradesh (then Assam's North-East Frontier Agency) with Yunnan in the 1940s and which was named after the Commander of US-Chinese joint forces in their war against Imperial Japan, General Joseph Stilwell. The Stilwell Road had fallen into disrepair in Myanmar and India, but offered an alignment for enabling heavy commercial traffic in the future. 173 An absence of road and railway connectivity, especially usable alignments linking BCIM countries, added to the challenges. China and Myanmar, and Myanmar and India, had developed border roads connecting neighbouring regions, but apart from stretches of Yunnan-Myanmar highways, these were unsuited to serving BCIM- Three Asian Highway routes traversed 1771 km of Bangladeshi territory. AH1: from Dawki (India) to Petrapole (India) via Tamabil-Sylhet-Dhaka-Bhanga-Jessore-Benapole (Bangladesh), ran for 492 km in Bangladesh. AH2: from Dawki (India) to Fulbari (India) via Tamabil-Sylhet-Dhaka South-Dhaka North-Bogra-Rangpur-Bangalbandha (Bangladesh), ran for 294 km in Bangladesh. These two could serve as sections of the BCIM's Myanmar-Bangladesh-India alignment. AH41: from Teknaf-Cox's Bazar via Feni-Dhaka South-Dhaka North-Kushtia-Jessore-Khulna to Mongla, ran for 762 km excluding 162 km common with AH2. 175 This section, with existing spurs, could serve as a Southern Myanmar-Bangladesh-India K2K alignment with an extension to the Chittagong port in South-Eastern Bangladesh.",

Fighting between Rohingya militants and Myanmar forces triggering an exodus of refugees to Bangladesh in 2017-2018 halted road link discussions. And even though Modi and Li presided over the first session of a new forum of Chinese and Indian provincial leaders, BCIM faded. Top-level engagement failed to breathe life into the vision. 191 Perhaps to mitigate that disappointment, Beijing focused on Myanmar's National League for Democracy (NLD) after it won general elections and took office following decades of military rule. Even before the NLD assumed power, in December 2014, signalling diplomatic pragmatism, Beijing hosted its head, Aung San Suu Kyi, as the official leader of the opposition. In early 2015, as the NLD moved towards replacing military-backed politicians hitherto enjoying Beijing's backing, fighting between ethnic Chinese autonomists and Myanmar forces flared along sections of the 2185 km Sino-Myanmar borders. 192 Naypyitaw's forces occasionally crossed into Chinese territory. Suu Kyi also closed several major Chinese-funded projects seen as detrimental to local interests. The NLD, beneficiary of US, Indian and Japanese support, was considered a nationalist party opposed to alleged Chinese tacit co-option of Myanmar's military rulers. 193 Against that backdrop, Beijing hosted Suu Kyi in mid-2015 before general elections in November, which the NLD won.",

Taking office as State Counsellor in March 2016, Suu Kyi returned to Beijing on another official visit in August. Agile pragmatism restored bilateral warmth. 196 Naypyitaw's troubles over the Rohingya crisis, triggered by Muslim attacks on the repressive Arakan state police exploding into an 'ethnic cleansing' response, reportedly killing and raping many stateless Rohingyas, forced over 700,000 survivors to seek refuge in Bangladesh. 197 Widely condemned in the west, Myanmar deepened its China ties. As international organisations and news media focused on the Rohingya's plight, especially in vast 'temporary' refugee camps sprawling across South-Eastern Bangladesh, the UNSC debated their fate. In mid-March 2017, the USA and its allies tabled a draft mildly critical of Myanmar's actions, including denial of 'humanitarian access to all effected areas'. China, with Russian support, blocked a vote. 198 Two months later, Suu Kyi attended the inaugural BRF in Beijing. In October, a Chinese consortium acquired 70% equity in the Kyaukphyu port with its oil and gas pipeline terminals linking the Bay of Bengal to Kunming. 199 With UN critics silenced, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi proposed a 'three-step solution' to the Rohingya issue in November. 192 Naing (2016 ). 193 Naing (2016 . 194 Pang and Wang (2015) . 195 Nian (2018 ). 196 Naing (2016 . 197 Darusman et al.

In her meetings with Xi and his aides, they agreed to speed up construction of the Sino-Myanmar economic corridor, part of the BRI/BCIM blueprint. 200 Her entourage included Myanmar's energy and construction ministers and the CM of Mandalay, a key waypoint along the BRI's Kyaukpyu-Kunming alignment. The team first stopped off at Kunming for dinner meetings with provincial leaders. Deepening economic and security diplomacy between the neighbours enabled the partial pursuit of Beijing's BRI vision along moribund alignments so that work could resume if and when recalcitrant parties reconsidered their options. 201",

In July 2018, Li Keqiang co-hosted his CEEC counterparts at a 16 + 1 summit in Bulgaria. On the sidelines, 700 CEEC businessmen and executives from 250 plus Chinese firms discussed current and future projects. Bulgaria's Deputy Foreign Minister Georg Georgiev noted, 'Our main goal is to increase Chinese business presence in Bulgaria and in the whole region of Central and Eastern Europe'. Li replied, 'China, now and in the future, supports European integration and welcomes a united, stable, open and prosperous Europe and a strong Euro'. 203 Notwithstanding benign sentiments, the 16 + 1 process deepened EU unease over Chinese presence sufficiently for the EU to discuss the issue at the highest levels. 204 The Balkan Silk Road, despite early excitement, did not advance very fast. Also, Beijing gained little influence over CEEC voting practices at the UN and other international fora on issues affecting China's interests. In terms of resource flows, Chinese investments contributed less than one per cent of the CEEC's FDI stock; and more than 90% of Beijing's EU investment went to Western Europe. China-CEEC trade grew from around $50bn in 2012 to $90bn in 2017, falling short of stated aspirations of crossing $100bn by 2015. 205 CEEC exports to China often comprised products bearing components from the rest of the EU while some Chinese exports to CEEC destinations were reexported to Western Europe. EU anxiety appeared to be founded more on presumptions and subliminal concerns than on an empirically evident complex reality.",

Italy's accession to BRI was topped by Greece joining and expanding the China-CEEC grouping to 17 + 1 at the April 2019 Dubrovnic summit in Croatia. 210 Some tension persisted.

In 2004, during Myanmar's Prime Minister's visit to Dhaka, officials signed a MoU endorsing this proposal. In July 2007, Myanmar's Construction Minister and his Bangladeshi counterpart signed an agreement affirming Dhaka's offer to fund construction of the crucial Phase-1 between Guandhum in Cox's Bazar and Bawlibazar in Rakhine, a 25 km stretch with 2 km in Bangladesh and 23 km in Myanmar, of the planned 153 km Bangladesh-Myanmar Friendship Road. Myanmar would build a border trade economic zone near Bawlibazar, formalising informal border trade. The two ministers reportedly discussed linking the planned road to Myanmar's highway to Kunming as part of BCIM connectivity, but this was left out of official records. 174 In July 2009, Bangladesh signed the UN's 2003 Inter-governmental Agreement on the Asian Highway Network, and the Agreement entered into force for Dhaka in November.",

By mid-2008, Sino-Kazakh trade represented about 70% of China's Central Asian commerce. Kazakh success in halving its poverty level in 15 years and raising per capita GDP to $9400, second only to Russia's $12,000 among former Soviet Republics, encouraged Beijing. 31 Astana reciprocated by opening consulates in Hong Kong and Shanghai, boosting economic exchanges. In the 1990s, diplomacy pursued goals of 'good neighbourliness' and stabilisation by settling border disputes. Since Hu Jintao's June 2003 visit and the launch of a five-year cooperative programme, economics predominated. In May 2004, the partners established a Kazakhstan-China Cooperation Committee to implement agreed programmes and drive further growth. Given Kazakhstan's relative wealth, China's 2004 offer of $900m credit for Central Asia, executed from 2006, targeted poorer Stans. 32 In July 2005, Hu Jintao and his Kazakh host, Nursultan Nazarbayev, proclaimed a 'strategic partnership'. Trade expanded by 22% to $8.3bn in 2006. 33 Nazarbayev's return visit in December 2006 produced a 'Cooperation Strategy for the twentyfirst Century' and a 'Plan for Economic Cooperation'. The leaders agreed to build a four-lane motorway linking Lianyungang in eastern China to St. Petersburg, Russia, by extending China's Lianhua highway to Khorgos and on to Western Russia. Hu returned to Astana in August 2007, signing nine agreements, stressing mutual determination to diversify trade composition from energy and commodities, and secure balance. Cabinet-and official-level exchanges implemented leadership-level accord. A decade before Xi Jinping hosted the first BRF, Beijing and Astana began discussing knitting together Eurasia with connectivity hardware and software.In March 2007, Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov inspected the Korgas-Khorgos and Dostyk-Alashankou border crossings to better understand issues relating to frontier inspections regimes, customs procedures and trans-shipment infrastructure. China mostly imported petroleum and ferrous and non-ferrous metals, while Kazakhstan bought consumer goods, e.g. textiles, shoes, appliances, toys, electronics, spare-parts, foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals. Despite a dramatic growth in commerce, however, the trade balance mirrored overall imbalances: in 2006, Kazakhstan",

Anxiety over China's foundational role in BCIM and its 'strategic objectives' turned BCIM in Indian eyes into a tool of Beijing's 'geo-strategic and economic interests in the region', giving China 'unfettered access to the Bay of Bengal'. 181 Additionally, while Yunnan represented the Chinese 'pillar' driving BCIM's development, North-Eastern Indian states, given their 'security status', could not pursue reciprocal diplomatic/economic initiatives.
