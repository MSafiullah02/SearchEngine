In addition, wars, pollution, food-related illness, and human\u2013animal relationships cause the emergence and propagation of new types of diseases and viruses. Subsequently, with the emergence of an unknown disease, the governments face two major challenges: first, medical centers require more and more qualified staff in order to periodically monitor each patient and quickly act when an emergency state is detected. Second, the correct diagnosis of the patient\u2019s state and the progress of his situation are critical for medical staff. Recently, the \u201cCoronavirus\u201d propagated in China has threatened millions of people and the government was obliged to quickly build hospitals and increase the number of medical workers. Furthermore, integrating new technologies in healthcare has became an essential task in order to make hospitals more efficient in terms of monitoring and analyzing patient data, thus enhancing medical processes.",

Smart technologies have opened up a world of applications in disease diagnostic and treatment such as for cancer, glucose monitoring, depression, Parkinson\u2019s disease, connected contact lenses, etc. Furthermore, this has been a big motivation for healthcare organizations to heavily invest in big data analytics.",

This type of data has three characteristics: (1) massive data collection; (2) high speed generation; and (3) heterogeneous nature. Unfortunately, the relational database management systems and the traditional data storage technologies cannot handle such type and amount of data.Rapid emergency detection: Usually, a normal health range is defined for each vital sign. Records outside this range lead to an abnormal situation which should be quickly detected and reported to the medical staff in order to take suitable actions. Hence, rapid emergency detection is a crucial event that can be a threat to patient safety or even life.Disease diagnosis and patients\u2019 classification: In health applications, several diseases may generate similar symptoms. Hence, disease diagnosis is susceptible to human error which may provoke disabilities or death. Therefore, developing new techniques and algorithms in order to study, on the one hand, the correlation between symptoms and, on the other hand, classify patients according to their situations can help in making the right decision.",

The authors of [6] proposed the Priority-based Compressed Data Aggregation (PCDA) technique to reduce the amount of heath data transmitted. PCDA uses a compressed sensing approach followed by a cryptographic hash algorithm to save information accuracy before sending data for any diagnosis. The authors of [7] proposed a data reduction technique dedicated to wireless seizure systems. In addition to local compressive sensing, the proposed technique selects a set of features, specifically those with nonlinear autocorrelation, to reduce the seizure signals sent to the data server. In [8], a cloud-based connected healthcare system, called BigReduce, is proposed. The objective of BigReduce is to minimize the data processing cost at the base station according to two schemes applied locally at the IoT sensors: reduction and decision schemes. Finally, the authors of [9] proposed a fault tolerance and data recovery algorithm in order to ensure the integrity of heath information and save the network energy. The proposed algorithm works in a distributed manner and it maintains a set of active nodes where each one copies its data to its neighbors according to several assumptions.",

The authors of [13] proposed a storage and processing architecture based on MapReduce and HBase, respectively. First, data generated by health sensors are inserted into HBase using a mass insertion script, and then a data analysis algorithm is proposed in order to retrieve valuable data and help in predicting disease. In [14], the authors proposed a Hadoop-based framework in order to secure the transmitted data from biosensors to the server. The proposed framework relies on three main pillars: The Hadoop clusters for storing, backing up, and recovering data; a digital signature method, called ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), which is implemented in Sunspot nodes in order to secure communication; and the Sqoop tool, which is used to import and export data between Mysql and Hadoop HDFS. In [15], a modern platform for healthcare information systems consisting of three layers is proposed. The first layer is composed of various data health sources such as sensors, clinical report, medication, etc. The second layer aims to process and store data and it uses various Hadoop tools including Sqoop, HDFS, HBase, MapReduce. and Hive. The last layer is responsible for applying business intelligence (BI) solutions over the stored data and it uses SpagoBI tools as an open source BI suite. Lastly, the authors of [16] proposed a correlation-based outlier detection platform, relying on Hadoop, to handle streaming of data generated in health applications. The objective of the platform is to search statistical relationships among biosensors, and then, in a later step, to predict contextual anomalies using an aggregated outlier checker.",

In [19], a framework for stress detection and evaluation is proposed. The framework works by detecting first stress signals according to skin conductance parameter, and then the stress level is evaluated through fuzzy inference system based on patient vital signs, particularly heart rate, respiration rate, and average blood pressure. In a later work [20], the authors proposed a data management framework for data collection and decision making in sensing-based healthcare. The framework relies on three algorithms: first, an emergency detection algorithm aims to send critical records directly to the coordinator; second, an adaptive sampling rate algorithm based on ANOVA (ANalysis of Variance) and Fisher test allows each sensor to adapt its sampling to the variation of patient situation; and third, a data fusion and decision making model is proposed to the coordinator based on decision matrix and fuzzy set theory. Despite its great advantages for patient monitoring and assessment, the proposed framework suffers from several disadvantages: (1) sensors only send critical records to the coordinator, thus medical staff cannot avoid patients entering dangerous situations before this happens; (2) in case of low critical patients, none of the data would be archived in the hospital, thus revising patient archives to check patient progress from doctors is not possible; and (3) integrating new data technologies, such as Hadoop, in order to handle big data collected by biosensors is not considered in the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed platform is still the only complete system that integrates both data analytics and Hadoop ecosystems. In addition, it consists of a sequence of layers aiming to tackle other problems related to patient classification and disease diagnosis. Finally, it combines several approaches such as machine learning, data mining, clustering, classification, etc.",

Mainly, our system relies on Hadoop ecosystems, which are built on clusters using parallel computing. On the one hand, the cluster architecture ensures a high scalability and reliability of the collected data as well as a fast and huge data storage. On the other hand, the parallel computing ensures a rapid data processing and analysis, especially when the volume of data becomes huge. Furthermore, the architecture of our platform consists of four layers, which allow an entire data analysis process for patients in hospitals, starting from patient data collection and ending with patients\u2019 classification and decision making. Subsequently, each layer performs batch and/or real-time processing. In batch mode, data are first stored in cluster nodes and then processed, while, in real-time mode, data are processed upon collection and before storing. These two processing modes provide a high efficiency in terms of applying any desired techniques (machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining, etc.) over the collected data.",

Data sources are the active biosensors which allow continuously monitoring a patient and send data in real-time toward the data storage via data ingestion tools. In addition, data sources could be an archive of patients\u2019 records which is already built by the hospital, mostly based on relational database system, and should also be sent toward the data storage center. We use two ingestion tools, namely kafka [23] and sqoop [24], to process and store streaming of data coming from different data sources.Real time data decision and data storage: This layer uses Spark [25] and Hadoop HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) [26] to process and store data, respectively. After installing it on the master cluster node, Spark receives data coming from Kafka and applies two algorithms: the first one allows detecting emergency situations and then taking the right action by the medical staff and the other searches for missing records before sending the final data to the HDFS for storage. Subsequently, data are stored in three Hadoop nodes according to HDFS cluster computing.Patient classification and disease diagnosis: This layer uses batch mode processing and aims to classify and find the correlation after data storing. Two algorithms are proposed: The first one uses an adapted version of Kmeans [27] clustering and aims to find patients with similar situations. The second one uses the data mining approach to allow better understanding when diagnosing any disease.Data retrieval and visualization: This layer allows medical staff to retrieve patient data from the data storage and then to visualize them in order to analyze and understand the patient\u2019s situation. We use two tools from the Hadoop ecosystems (Hive [28] and SparkSQL [25]) and Matplotlib [29] from Python.",

Accordingly, tsSvp is the subset with scores s of tSVp for the set of records tRVp. Thus, tRvp=\u222ai=03tiRvp while tSvp=\u222ai=03tiSvp. Let |X| be the norm zero, i.e., the number of non-zero elements in a set X. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume a portion of records collected for two patients p and q during a period t where two record vectors tRvp and tRvq are stored, respectively, for p and q. Then, the stability level, noted as stab, of the vital sign v of the two patients can be calculated as the overlap between the number of similar records (having the same scores) in tRvp and tRvq, as shown in the following equation:(1)stab(tRvp,tRvq)=\u2211k=03min(|tkRvp|,|tkRvq|)min(|tRvp|,|tRvq|)\u00d7100\nwhere |tkRvp| means the number of records with score k in tRvp. Therefore, stab ranges between 0 and 100, where 0 means that both patients have similar stable situation and 100 indicates a severely unstable situation for both patients.",

For the sake of simplicity, we describe, in the next section, the process of SKmeans based on one patient\u2019s vital signs v\u2208V but similar process can be adapted to all other vital signs. Similar to traditional Kmeans, the idea of SKmeans is to first define a positive number of clusters (K) and then a set of K datasets is randomly selected as the initial centroids of the clusters. After that, for each dataset, the distances to all centroids are calculated where the dataset is assigned to the nearest one. At this point, the new centroid is recomputed for each cluster and the process is repeated until the convergence of the algorithm. Obviously, the optimal number of clusters (K) can be selected depending on the number of patients in the hospital and their situations. However, compared to traditional Kmeans, SKmeans has two main differences:First, patients are grouped according to the scores of records and not the records themselves.Second, in each iteration, a patient is assigned to the nearest centroid based on the stability level calculated using Equation (1) and not the Euclidean distance over the whole record vectors as in the traditional Kmeans. This leads to a huge reduction of the cost of calculation.",

However, our version is more dedicated to sensing-based healthcare and takes into account the record sores when finding correlation among vital signs. Assume a cluster contains \u03b8 patients, where \u03b8<\u03b3, with their corresponding stored record vectors tSv=[tSv1,tSv2,\u22ef,tSv\u03b3]. Then, we describe both steps used in our algorithm as follows:Find frequent scores: This step aims to find the most repetitive scores of each vital sign of a patient to meet a certain threshold. We called the threshold as minimum score strength, expressed as \u03bc, which takes a value between 0 and 100. Then, we calculate the strength, str, of each score tsSvp\u2208Svp, where s\u2208[0,3], of a vital sign according to the following equation:\n(2)str(tsSvp)=|tsSvp||tSvp|\u00d7100\nwhere s\u2208[0,3]. Therefore, if str(tsSvp)\u2265\u03bc, then the score is considered as a strong score. Indeed, if a vital sign contains more than one score, then the vital sign assigned a unique notation according to Table 1:At the end of this step, patients with score notations at each cluster are defined in the form of the following matrix (i\u2208[0,14]):\nHRSBPRROS\u22efpatient#1=patient#2=\u22eepatient#\u03b8=(IHRiISBPiIRRiIOSi\u22efIHRiISBPiIRRiIOSi\u22ef\u22ee\u22ee\u22ee\u22ee\u22eeIHRiISBPiIRRiIOSi\u22ef)Generate strong association: In this step, we try to find strong correlation rules between vital signs of all patients. By definition, the rules must be provided from frequent patient scores and must satisfy, in addition to the minimum score strength \u03bc, a minimum confidence expressed as \u03c1.

Since SKmeans algorithm highly reduces the number of iterations, it simultaneously reduces the execution time compared to the traditional Kmeans. Subsequently, SKmeans can optimize the processing time speed up to three times compared to Kmeans.",

Indeed, one can find various coefficients that is proposed in the literature to evaluate the clustering. In this paper, we select the Silhouette coefficient [33] as one of the most popular metrics to evaluate the accuracy of SKmeans and Kmeans algorithms. By definition, the Silhouette coefficient score ranges between \u22121 (which indicates a low clustering accuracy) and +1 (which indicates a high clustering accuracy) while 0 indicates nested clusters. Generally, the Silhouette coefficient is a composite index that indicates the cohesion and separation of the clusters and can apply several distance measures. In this work, the Silhouette coefficient is adapted to the Euclidean distance that is calculated as follows:(5)S=Ei(tRVp)\u2212Ej(tRVp)max(Ei(tRVp),Ej(tRVp))\nwhere Ei(tRVp) is the mean Euclidean distance of the record set tRVp to other record sets within the same cluster and Ej(tRVp) is the mean Euclidean of record set tRVp to record sets in the other clusters.",
