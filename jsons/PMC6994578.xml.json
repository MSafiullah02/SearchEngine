At regular flow setting, trans-nasal albuterol delivery for stable patients with chronic obstructive airway diseases has been shown to elicit similar response as conventional nebulization treatment [6\u20138], such as small volume jet nebulizer via mask/mouthpiece or metered dose inhaler with spacer. Similarly, it has demonstrated better tolerance and comfort than jet nebulizer via mask for young pediatric patients [1\u20133].",

            "text": "Due to its features of no additional gas and little to no residual volume, vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) has been commonly utilized in trans-nasal aerosol delivery [1\u20135, 7\u20139]. However, the currently available commercial product of VMN generates aerosol continuously. This continuous production causes the waste of aerosolized medication during patient expiratory phase, which is up to three times longer than the inspiratory phase. Because of this drawback, VMN is commonly placed distal from the patient, making the circuit and humidifier chamber act as a reservoir to contain the aerosol generated during expiratory phase, resulting in more aerosol available to the patient [9]. The technique of synchronizing aerosol production with patient\u2019s inspiratory effort is available in small volume jet nebulizer, which shows threefold increase of inhaled aerosol mass over the conventional continuous jet nebulizer [10]. Michotte et al. integrated this algorithm into VMN and compared its efficiency with continuous VMN during noninvasive ventilation; both in vitro and in vivo studies found that inspiration synchronized VMN produced higher lung dosage than continuous VMN [11, 12]. However, little has been known about inspiration synchronized aerosol via HFNC. Thus, our objective of this study was to compare the inhaled dose of aerosol generated by inspiration synchronized vs continuous VMN via adult HFNC.",

The two chambers could be moved together as for the connection via a rigid metal piece; one chamber was driven by a critical care ventilator (PB 840, Medtronic\u2019s, Minneapolis, MN, USA), functioning as respiratory muscle to move the other chamber which was connected to the manikin to simulate spontaneous breathing. Nasal breathing was simulated by sealing the manikin\u2019s mouth (Fig. 1). Quiet breathing pattern was set as tidal volume (Vt) 500 mL, respiratory rates (RR) 15 breaths per minute, inspiratory time (Ti) 1.33 s, inspiratory to expiratory ratio (I:E) 1:2, and inspiratory flow 22.5 L/min, compared to distressed breathing set at Vt 700 mL, RR 30 breaths per minute, Ti 1.0 s, I:E 1:1, and inspiratory flow 42 L/min [13, 15]. These breathing patterns were achieved by adjusting ventilator settings, with the feedback from measurement by NICO2 monitor (Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA), which was placed between the chamber and trachea.\n",

Inspiration synchronized aerosol generates higher inhaled dose by reducing the waste during exhalation; this explains our findings with nebulizer placed close to patient, which agreed with the finding that higher inhaled dose with breath actuated jet nebulizer than continuous jet nebulizer when it was placed at the Y-piece during invasive ventilation [10]. Moreover, Michotte et al. found higher inhaled dose with inspiration synchronized VMN than continuous VMN during noninvasive ventilation, particularly when nebulizer was placed between the single-limb ventilator and exhalation port; the waste of aerosol was more significant with continuous VMN than inspiration synchronized VMN [11]. In Golshahi et al.\u2019s study, they used similar breathing parameters during quiet breathing (Vt 500 ml, RR 15) but only investigated one gas flow (20 L/min), with nebulizer placed close to patient; they also found higher inhaled dose at nostril level with inspiration synchronized than continuous aerosol [19]. However, we found one exception that with gas flow at 5 L/min, inhaled dose was higher with continuous than inspiration synchronized aerosol, which might be explained by the significant reduction of the washing out effects due to the extremely low flow, resulting in reservoir of aerosol during exhalation for continuous aerosol. In contrast, because of the low flow rate to carry aerosol, aerosol generated at the inspiratory phase might not be able to fully reach the trachea yet before exhalation [20, 21].",

            "text": "Due to the concerns of the aerosol waste during exhalation, continuous VMN was found to generate higher inhaled dose when placed at the inlet of humidifier, using the circuit and humidifier chamber as reservoir during exhalation. However, the reservoir advantages were predominantly with high gas flow, specifically with GF:IF > 0.5. This finding agreed with the results in our previous pediatric study [14]. With GF:IF < 0.5, the reservoir benefits were attenuated; this might be explained by the gravitational sedimentation effects, which increased as the aerosol stayed longer in the circuit and chamber due to the low flow [21, 22]. The optimal period that the aerosol stays in the circuit and chamber to generate the best inhaled dose needs to balance the reservoir benefits and the gravitational sedimentation effects, depending on the reservoir volume and the speed of the transporting gas [21, 22]. As the reservoir volume of adult HFNC system is a constant (~ 1000 mL in adult circuit), this optimal point depends on the transporting gas, including the HFNC gas flow and patient inspiratory flow. From our previous adult in vitro study [13] and this study, using the same adult HFNC system, we found the highest inhaled dose was generated when the GF:IF was around 0.5. The rationale of this number needs more mathematical efforts to explore in the future, but this phenomenon was also seen in both in vitro and in vivo studies with neonatal invasive ventilation that with appropriate reservoir volume and transporting gas flow, continuous VMN even the expiratory actuated VMN could generate higher inhaled dose than inspiratory actuated VMN with inappropriate reservoir volume or transporting gas flow [23, 24]. Similarly, Berlinski et al. speculated that there was an optimal bias flow setting to carry aerosol with continuous VMN placed at the inlet of humidifier during invasive ventilation [21].",

However, when gas flow was reduced to < 50% of patient inspiratory flow, this waste was significantly reduced. Instead, aerosol starts to be stored in the system as a bolus before the next inhalation; patient inhales the bolus of aerosol during the next inhalation [22].

Particularly, the impact of reservoir benefits vs gravitational sedimentation effects on the trans-nasal aerosol delivery, such as the optimal GF:IF ratio, is worthy to investigate, in order to improve trans-nasal aerosol delivery. Even though no commercially available device allows us to measure patient inspiratory flow breath by breath, the concept of the optimal flow ratio can still guide clinicians to titrate gas flow during aerosol delivery via HFNC, rather than using one constant flow. More importantly, once devices to monitor patient inspiratory flow are commercially available, using inspiration synchronized VMN at the inlet of humidifier at the optimal gas flow can significantly increase inhaled dose by 50\u201375%. Additionally, regarding the optimal placement of continuous VMN in adult populations, our findings support the current clinical practice to place continuous VMN at the inlet of humidifier rather than close to patient, especially at high gas flow settings.",

Moreover, we only used one manikin with one size of anatomical airway; even it was made based on the most common size of healthy male adults, our results still could not represent all patients. Future studies with more sizes of anatomical airways particularly with different airway diseases are needed. Additionally, we only investigated the aerosol spray duration at the beginning 50% of inspiratory phase; more studies might be needed to explore different aerosol spray durations to seek for the optimal percentage. Lastly, similar to all the in vitro studies [11, 13\u201316, 19\u201322, 24], the manikin\u2019s airway did not have physiological functions such as heat and humidify the gas, filter and absorb the medication by the upper airway, etc; additionally, the filter can capture all the aerosol while some aerosol might be exhaled in vivo, contributing to the higher aerosol deposition in the lung with in vitro study.",

When HFNC gas flow was higher than 50% of patient inspiratory flow, inspiration synchronized aerosol did not add clinical advantage over continuous nebulizer placed at the inlet of humidifier. However, when the HFNC gas flow was set lower than 50% of patient inspiratory flow, inspiration synchronized nebulizer placed at the inlet of humidifier generated higher inhaled dose than continuous nebulizer, regardless of nebulizer position. Further research is required to understand variables and potential clinical benefits.",
