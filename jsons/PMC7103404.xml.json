The replicase complex consists of multiple proteins, including viral proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and auxiliary proteins, and host factors (Ahlquist et al., 2003, van der Heijden and Bol, 2002). cis-Acting RNA elements also play essential roles in viral RNA replication. These RNA elements are often distributed throughout the genomic RNAs, including protein-coding regions. Generally, the 3\u2032 proximal nucleotide sequences of viral genomic RNAs are essential to initiate negative-strand RNA synthesis. These RNA elements alone are often sufficient to function in recruiting the viral replicase supplied in trans for initiating RNA synthesis (Buck, 1996, Kao et al., 2001).",

Likewise, defective-RNAs occurring naturally or created artificially as constructed-deletion variants can be efficiently amplified by a helper virus that supplies replicase component proteins in trans. In contrast, cis-preferential function of the viral encoded proteins or a coupling between translation and replication has been reported for several viruses, including Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) (Neeleman and Bol, 1999, van Rossum et al., 1996), Clover yellow mosaic virus (CYMV) (White et al., 1992), Bovine coronavirus (Chang et al., 1994), Cowpea mosaic virus (van Bokhoven et al., 1993), Poliovirus (Hagino-Yamagishi and Nomoto, 1989, Johnson and Sarnow, 1991, Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994), Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) (White et al., 1995), Tobacco etch virus (Mahajan et al., 1996, Schaad et al., 1996), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Lewandowski and Dawson, 2000), Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (Oster et al., 1998), Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) (Weiland and Dreher, 1993), and Rubella virus (Liang and Gillam, 2001).

            "text": "\nRed clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) is a positive-strand RNA virus in the Dianthovirus genus, Tombusviridae family (van Regenmortel et al., 2000). Its genome is divided into RNA1 and RNA2. RNA1 encodes two N-terminal overlapping non-structural proteins of 27 kDa (p27) and 88 kDa (p88). p88 has an RdRP motif (Koonin, 1991) and is produced by programmed \u2212 1 ribosomal frameshifting (Kim and Lommel, 1994, Kim and Lommel, 1998, Xiong et al., 1993b). Both p27 and p88 are required for viral RNA replication. RNA2 encodes a 35 kDa movement protein (MP) required for viral cell-to-cell movement in plants (Lommel et al., 1988, Xiong et al., 1993a). RNA2 is not required for the replication of RNA1 in protoplasts (Mizumoto et al., 2003, Osman and Buck, 1987, Paje-Manalo and Lommel, 1989), but a stem\u2013loop structure on the protein-coding region of RNA2 is necessary for the synthesis of subgenomic RNA from RNA1 in an RNA-mediated trans-activation mechanism, which leads to the expression of coat protein (CP) (Sit et al., 1998, Tatsuta et al., 2005). In addition to 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs) of RNA2, the same stem\u2013loop structure is essential for RNA2 replication (Tatsuta et al., 2005, Turner and Buck, 1999).",

The 3\u2032-UTR of RCNMV RNA1 contains cis-acting RNA elements (TE-3\u2032 DR1) that can function as a cap-independent translational enhancer (Mizumoto et al., 2003). However, RNA2 has no such cis-acting RNA element. The strong link between the cap-independent translation and replication of RNA2 suggests that RNA2 functions as mRNA for translation only when generated de novo through the viral RNA replication machinery (Mizumoto et al., 2006). The RNA silencing suppression activity of RCNMV is also linked to viral RNA replication (Takeda et al., 2005). Thus, p27 and p88 play important roles not only in viral RNA synthesis but also in the regulation of viral gene expression, and the suppression of host resistance during viral infection.",

In this study, we investigated how p27 and p88 were engaged in the replication of RCNMV genomic RNAs in protoplasts and in a cell-free extract of evacuolated BY-2 protoplasts (BYL) by using DNA vectors or in vitro transcribed RNAs expressing viral proteins and RNAs. Results indicated that RNA1 mutants from which intact p88 was translated were efficiently replicated in the presence of p27 in protoplasts, whereas RNA1 mutants from which p27 alone or no functional p88 was translated were replicated to very low levels in the presence of p88 and p27, even at levels sufficient to replicate RNA2. Together with the results obtained from in vitro experiments in BYL, our results suggest a cis-preferential function of p88 in the replication of RNA1.",

However, it is difficult to address the above question by gene manipulation in the region used to create pUBRC1-p27, because any nucleotide changes in the region accompany changes in amino acid sequences in p88, which may affect RNA replication. Therefore, to avoid the effects of gene manipulation on amino acid sequences and cis-acting replication elements, we created other p88-deficient RNA1 mutants by substituting the U at position 871, thirty nucleotides downstream of the stop codon of p27, because base-substitutions in the region of 870\u2013875 nt have been shown not to affect RNA replication and systemic infection of RCNMV (Kim and Lommel, 1998). pUBRC1-871A and pUBRC1-871G had A and G, respectively, at position 871, which create an additional stop codon to prevent p88 expression. pUBRC1-871C had C at position 871 to create a synonymous codon for wild-type tyrosine (Fig. 1). These plasmids were inoculated into cowpea protoplasts alone or together with pUBp88 or a mixture of pUBp27 and pUBp88. pUBRC2 was also used to confirm the expression of p27 and p88. In inoculation with pUBRC1-871A or pUBRC1-871G alone, RNA1 mutants did not accumulate to detectable levels, confirming the lack of expression of functional p88 from these RNA1 mutants (Fig. 3\n, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, RNA1 from pUBRC1-871C accumulated to a level similar to wild-type RNA1 (Fig. 3, lanes 5). Supplementation of p88, or both p88 and p27 in trans did not efficiently support the replication of RNA1 mutants from pUBRC1-871A and pUBRC1-871G (Fig. 3. lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12), whereas the trans-supplied p88 efficiently supported RNA2 replication with co-inoculated pUBRC1-871A or pUBRC1-871G (Fig. 3. lanes 7 and 8). The successful replication of RNA1 from pUBRC1-871C suggested that single-nucleotide substitutions at this position did not affect cis-acting RNA elements required for replication. Together, these results suggest that the impaired ability of RNA1 mutants expressing p27 alone to be amplified by trans-supplied p88 is caused by a cis-preferential requirement of p88 for RNA1 replication.",

The GDD motif is conserved in RdRP (Koonin and Dolja, 1993), and is required for RCNMV RNA synthesis (Bates et al., 1995). Cowpea protoplasts were inoculated with pUBRC1-p88uGVD or pUBRC1 together with or without pUBp88p and pUBRC2. In protoplasts inoculated with pUBRC1-p88uGVD, the accumulation of RNA1 was extremely low compared to that of wild-type RNA1 from pUBRC1 (Fig. 4\n). Similar results were obtained in coinoculation with a mixture of pUBp88 and pUBRC2 (Fig. 4). These results indicated that wild-type p88 supplied in trans did not complement the impaired replication of RNA1 mutant containing GVD motif. Failure of the rescue in the replication of RNA1 mutant with GVD motif by wild-type p88 suggests that the act of translation throughout the p88 ORF is insufficient by itself to recruit replication factors including p88 to RNA1, and supports the cis-preferential requirement of p88 for RNA1 replication. The effect of the introduced mutation in the GVD mutant on cis-acting RNA replication elements is discussed later.",

In incubation of a mixture of RNA1 mutants corresponding to pUBRC1-p88u and pUBRC1-871A-dCP and a mixture of those corresponding to pUBRC1-p88u-dCP and pUBRC1-871A, negative-strand RNA1s with a size expected from the respective mutants expressing p88 were detected as a band with strong intensity (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 8). RNA bands with sizes corresponding to those expected for RNA1 mutants expressing p27 were also detected in these lanes, but the intensity of the bands was similar to that of RNA1 mutants incubated alone (Fig. 5, lanes 3 to 6). Therefore, these RNAs with weak signals were unlikely to be negative-strand RNA products synthesized from the input RNA1 mutants. Together, the results obtained in the BYL in vitro system indicated that negative-strand RNA was synthesized only from RNA1 mutants expressing p88 and in a cis-preferential manner.",

In these phenomena, the process of translation, including the protein-coding capacity of the D or DI RNAs, may be essential for viral RNA replication; alternatively the translated protein products included in the translation process may be essential for viral RNA replication. For example, the replication of poliovirus DI RNA requires inframe deletion in the 2B non-structural protein (Johnson and Sarnow, 1991) and the replication of DI RNAs with amber mutations introduced into the 2A protein gene is not complemented in trans by the wild-type virus (Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994). These observations suggest a cis-preferential requirement of either the encoded protein or the translation process itself through the coding region, or both, for RNA replication. In the case of a prototype of CYMV D RNA, the process of translation rather than the encoded protein is considered essential for RNA replication in the presence of helper CYMV RNA. The full-length D RNAs of CYMV containing prematurely terminated fusion ORFs are not viable, whereas D RNAs containing a variety of inframe deletions and insertions in the regions of the fusion ORF of the D RNA are viable, despite the observation that these fusion ORFs are unlikely to encode functional proteins (White et al., 1992).",

Failure in the replication of this mutant suggests that the translation process through p88 ORF, including \u2212 1 frameshift, is not sufficient to recruit replication proteins and to initiate the replication of RNA1. Although the effects of the mutation introduced at position 1818 on cis-acting RNA replication elements in the GVD mutant cannot be completely ruled out, no or little effect on RNA1 replication of one nucleotide substitution (G to C) at position 1815 in the GDD motif (ADD in the mutant) (H.

This is unlike RNA2, which has cis-acting RNA elements that can recruit replication proteins supplied in trans: the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA2 or the trans-activator located in the MP ORF are candidates for the cis-acting RNA elements of RNA2, because these elements are essential for the initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis (Takeda et al., 2005, Tatsuta et al., 2005, Turner and Buck, 1999; H. Iwakawa and T. Okuno, unpublished results). In place of such RNA elements in RNA2, p88 may function as an element for recruiting replication factors including p27 in RNA1 replication. Binding of p88 to the proper region of RNA1 through translation may cause a structural change in RNA1, which is required for the formation of RNA replication complexes. The regions may include RNA elements predicted in the 3\u2032 proximal regions of RNA1 that are essential for initiating RNA synthesis (Iwakawa et al., 2007). A structural change in RNA induced by viral protein and its translation has been reported in several RNA viruses. In the RNA bacteriophage MS2, translation of the CP gene is required for the expression of the replicase protein gene. The CP gene alone is accessible to ribosomes in the full-length genomic RNA. The ribosomal binding site of the replicase gene is masked by a base pairing to an internal CP gene located at upstream of the viral genome, and the expression of the replicase protein gene is coupled to the expression of CP by the disruption of the base pairing and release of the replicase start site (Berkhout and van Duin, 1985). CP-mediated RNA structural change has also been reported in the 3\u2032 UTR of genomic RNAs of AMV, in which CP plays an important role in initiation of viral RNA synthesis (Olsthoorn et al., 1999). In AMV, non-structural replicase component proteins encoded by genomic RNA 1 and RNA2 are required in cis for the replication of RNA1 and RNA2 (Neeleman and Bol, 1999, van Rossum et al., 1996).",

We have never detected p88 in RCNMV-infected cells and in incubation of wild-type RNA1 in BYL in our experimental conditions (unpublished data; Fig. 5). In BYL, p88 was detectable only in incubation of RNA1 mutants from which p88 alone is translated. This implies that most wild-type RNA1 can engage in translation to produce a large amount of p27 by functioning as a template for ribosomes without competing with RNA replicase. In addition to frameshifting regulation, such regulation should lead to overproduction of p27 in excess to that of p88, which may be important for RCNMV RNA replication and infection.",

Other mutants, pUBRC1-p88u, pUBRC1-871A, pUBRC1-871G, pUBRC1-871C, and pUBRC1-p88uGVD were created by PCR-based in vitro mutagenesis from pUBRC1. In short, recombinant PCR products were digested by appropriate restriction enzymes that had unique recognition sites neighboring the mutation sites in pUBRC1, and the fragments containing the mutation substituted the corresponding fragments in pUBRC1. The absence of unexpected base change was confirmed by sequencing the resulting plasmids. These RNA1 mutants transcribed from pUBRC1 plasmids with harboring mutations are summarized in Fig. 1. The plasmids for protein expression, pUBp27 and pUBp88 were previously described (Takeda et al., 2005). All infectious DNA plasmids were prepared by using QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit (QIAGEN). The plasmids pUCR1-871A, pUCR1-871A-dCP, pUCR1-p88u and pUCR1-p88u-dCP were created by replacement of the Aor51HI-BsiWI region in pUCR1 (Takeda et al., 2005) with the corresponding regions from pUBRC1-871A, pUBRC1-871-dCP, pUBRC1-p88u and pUBRC1-p88u-dCP, respectively. RNA transcripts were synthesized from these plasmids by T7 RNA polymerase after linearization by XmaI.",
