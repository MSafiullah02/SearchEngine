The ACE2 sequence is similar to those of the testis-specific or germinal form of ACE (tACE) and the Drosophila homolog of ACE (AnCE; sequence identities of 43% and 35%, and similarities of 61% and 55%, respectively) (21) . Conformational differences between the somatic form of ACE and germinal ACE account for the demonstration that ACE2 activity is not blocked by ACE inhibitors (15, 19) . The potential importance of ACE2, not only in the regulation of cardiac function and blood pressure but also in other disease states, has been realized with the discovery that ACE2 also serves as the cellular entry point for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (21) (22) (23) (24) . Prabakaran et al. (21) built a homology model of the ACE2 structure with a root-mean-square deviation less than 0.5 \u00c5 from the aligned crystal structures of tACE and AnCE. According to the authors a prominent feature of the model is a deep channel on the top of the molecule that contains the catalytic site (21) . Negatively charged ridges surrounding the channel may provide a possible binding site for the positively charged receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-glycoprotein, which they recently identified (25) . Several distinct patches of hydrophobic residues at the ACE2 surface were noted at close proximity to the charged ridges that could contribute to binding. These results may help explain the structure and function of ACE2.",

Early studies have demonstrated the Ang-(1-7) immunoreactivity in the cell bodies and in the axons of magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supra-optic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus as well as in the neurons of the nucleus circularis (26) . In fact, Ang-(1-7) immunoreactivity in neurons of the PVN and SON was co-localized with vasopressin-like immunoreactivity whereas Ang-(1-7) was not co-localized in paraventricular neurons immunoreactive for oxytocin (26, 27) . The same pattern of Ang-(1-7) immunoreactivity, seen in Sprague-Dawley rats, was also observed in the brains of (mRen2)27 transgenic rats (28) in which a subpopulation of nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons also contained Ang-(1-7)-like immunoreactivity. Collectively, the co-localization of Ang-(1-7) and vasopressin immunoreactivity in neurons of the magnocellular division of the PVN and the SON are congruent with functional studies demonstrating a role of Ang-(1-7) in the regulation of hydro-mineral balance involving neurons of the hypothalami-neurohypophysial pathway. In addition, the colocalization of Ang-(1-7) immunoreactivity in nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons of the PVN is especially interesting because a number of studies now show that the angiotensin peptides may modulate the disposition of reactive oxygen species in the PVN of animals with heart failure (29) .",

Ang-(1-7) immunoreactivity in Lewis rats was restricted to myocytes of both the right and left ventricles. Fig. 2 shows that Ang-(1-7) staining in myocytes had a granular appearance throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, there was a distinct absence of staining for the peptide in vascular smooth muscle as well as in interstitial cells of the heart. When Ang-(1-7) was examined in the hearts of rats subjected to ligation of the left main coronary artery, we observed a significant increase in Ang-(1-7) staining in ventricular myocytes that had undergone hypertrophic remodeling. In the region of ischemic damage there was a marked absence of Ang-(1-7) staining in fibroblasts and connective tissue. The increase in Ang-(1-7) staining in rats with congestive heart failure was positively correlated with an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and negatively correlated with 46 Part I / Ferrario et al. (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3B shows a granular reaction product for Ang-(1-7) staining in the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent arteriole (32) . It is interesting that blood vessels (arterioles) of the kidney exhibit Ang-(1-7) staining whereas this was not the observation for blood vessels in the heart or in other organs.",

Ang-(1-7) excites neurons in the PVN and in the nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla. The population of cells excited by Ang-(1-7) and Ang II shows some overlap, but the majority of cells respond to one or the other peptide. In addition to direct cellular actions, Ang-(1-7) releases other neurotransmitters including monoamines, substance P, vasopressin, glutamate, prostaglandins, and NO as reviewed recently (43) . Like Ang II, the Ang-(1-7)mediated release of vasopressin may involve tachykinin peptides (46) (47) (48) . In contrast, intracerebroventricular injections of Ang-(1-7) do not increase blood pressure or promote drinking, which are thought to be mediated by Ang II acting on monoaminergic pathways (49, 50) . An opposing action of Ang-(1-7) on central mechanisms regulating blood pressure is demonstrated by the finding that cerebroventricular injections of antibodies to Ang-(1-7) produce opposite effects to those of Ang II (47) . Evidence from studies using c-fos reveals that Ang-(1-7) activates pathways in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and median preoptic nucleus, whereas Ang II activates these pathways as well as those involving the PVN and subfornical organ (51, 52) . Pathways in the medulla oblongata appear separate for the two peptides as well, since sino-aortic denervation potentiated the responses to Ang-(1-7) but not those to Ang II in the nucleus of the solitary tract (53) .",

In ASrAogen animals deficient of glial angiotensinogen, a role for endogenous Ang-(1-7) to facilitate baroreflex sensitivity persists, whereas the attenuating effect of Ang II is lost (57) .

As an explanation for the fact that either D-Ala 7 -Ang-(1-7), AT 1 or AT 2 receptor antagonists, or some combination of the three antagonists is effective in blocking actions of Ang-(1-7) in brain, there is evidence that distinct subpopulations of classical AT 1 sites in the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (dmnX) exist showing differential sensitivity/selectivity to Ang-(1-7) and the AT 2 antagonist (43) . Moreover, AT 1 receptor antagonists (either losartan or candesartan) and D-Ala 7 -Ang-(1-7) block the actions of the peptide in the nTS (63) and ventrolateral medulla (64) . It is now recognized that the mas gene codes for a receptor responsible for vascular and renal effects of Ang-(1-7) (65) . Mice deficient in the mas receptor show impairments in the baroreceptor reflex and alterations in responses to Ang II (64, 66) , providing additional evidence of a role for endogenous Ang-(1-7) in these functions.",

Ang-(1-7) was formed in the intact human myocardial circulation in patients with postcardiac transplantation and its levels were decreased when Ang II formation was suppressed by enalaprilat (76) . The evolution of myocardial infarction in the rat 28 d after coronary artery ligation was accompanied by large increases in plasma Ang-(1-7) concentrations; further plasma Ang-(1-7) augmentation accompanied by reversal of cardiac remodeling because of continuous blockade of Ang II receptors with either losartan or olmesartan was accompanied by a threefold increase in cardiac ACE2 mRNA (75) .

            "text": "Although Ang-(1-7) is processed from either Ang I or Ang II in the circulation and in many tissues, it is important to emphasize that the processing pathways for Ang-(1-7) in the circulation and kidney are distinct. The endopeptidase neprilysin is the primary enzyme forming Ang-(1-7) from Ang I or Ang-(1-9) in the circulation (43, 82) . Although levels of neprilysin are low to undetectable, the enzyme is appropriately localized to the exocellular surface of endothelial and smooth muscle cells to contribute to the formation of Ang-(1-7). In the kidney, Ang-(1-7) is the primary product formed in preparations of isolated proximal tubules and exists in urine at significantly higher levels than Ang II (8) . Neprilysin may contribute to both the formation as well as the degradation of the peptide. Neprilysin cleaves Ang I to Ang-(1-7), but continues to metabolize Ang-(1-7) at the Tyr 5 -Ile 6 bond to form Ang-(1-4) and Ang-(5-7) (8, 9) . Indeed, neprilysin inhibitors increase the urinary levels of Ang-(1-7) in both human and rat (83, 84) . Moreover, the combined ACE/neprilysin inhibitor omapatrilat augmented renal and urinary levels of Ang-(1-7), but produced a blunted Ang-(1-7) response in plasma in comparison to ACE inhibition alone (32, 84) . Omapatrilat was also associated with increased expression of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) in the proximal tubule (85) . These data suggest that upregulation of ACE2 may contribute to the renal protective effects of ACE or combined vaso-peptidase inhibitors through increased conversion of Ang II to Ang-(1-7), as well as the reduced metabolism of Ang-(1-7). Indeed, ACE2 (-/-) mice exhibit enhanced intrarenal levels of Ang II and pronounced glomerulosclerosis (83) .",

            "text": "We found that Ang-(1-7) and ACE2 are present within the proximal tubular regions of the mouse and the rat kidney (86, 87) . These data clearly support the concept of a complete RAS within the proximal tubule including expression of renin, ACE, angiotensinogen, the AT 1 and AT 2 receptors (88, 89) . The presence of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in kidney supports the concept of important and divergent actions for the two peptides. For Ang II, renal actions include potent vasoconstriction, retention of sodium and water, as well as a stimulus for inflammation, and oxidative stress. In contrast, Ang-(1-7) stimulates diuresis and natriuresis that are associated with modest increases in the glomerular filtration rate (43) . Ang-(1-7) induces vasodilation of afferent arterioles through a NO-dependent pathway (90) . Indeed, immunocytochemical staining for the Ang-(1-7) receptor mas is evident in the afferent arteriole, as well as throughout the proximal tubules of the renal cortex providing biochemical support for the functional actions of the peptide (87) . Ang-(1-7) and its metabolite Ang-(3-7) are potent inhibitors of Na + , K + -ATPase activity in the renal epithelium (91) (92) (93) . Ang-(1-7) also inhibits the transcellular flux of sodium, which was associated with activation of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) (94). Ang-(1-7) dependent inhibition of sodium transport is potentiated by ACE inhibition suggesting a shift toward the formation and protection of Ang-(1-7) within the proximal tubules. The chronic and pronounced diuresis following omapatrilat treatment was associated with large increases in urinary excretion of Ang-(1-7) and enhanced immunocytochemical staining of the peptide in the kidney (32) . Recent studies have revealed that Ang-(1-7) abolished the Ang II-dependent stimulation of the Na + -ATPase activity in ovine kidney (95, 96) . Furthermore, intrarenal administration of Ang-(1-7) blocked the antinatriuretic actions of Ang II (97) . These studies emphasize that the actions of Ang-(1-7) within the kidney may be particularly relevant in the setting of an activated RAS. Moreover, the discrete localization of Ang- (1-7) , ACE2, and the mas receptor provides evidence for an alternative RAS within the proximal tubule epithelium that may antagonize the actions of Ang II in this renal compartment.",

There was a progressive rise of urinary Ang-(1-7) throughout normal human gestation, attaining levels that are 10-fold greater than that of the normal menstrual cycle. Urinary Ang II showed a similar pattern reaching levels that were 25-fold higher than the values at the menstrual cycle.

We identified Ang-(1-7) binding sites on bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), canine coronary artery rings, and rat blood vessels that are sensitive to [D-Ala 7 ]-Ang-(1-7) (108) (109) (110) . In addition, a multitude of physiological responses to Ang-(1-7) are selectively blocked by [D-Ala 7 ]-Ang-(1-7) or the sarcosine analogs of Ang II, but not by AT 1 or AT 2 receptor antagonists, including the depressor response to Ang-(1-7) in the pithed rat and the lowering of blood pressure in hypertensive rats (33, 40, 111) .

We refer to this receptor as the AT (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) receptor, as defined by its sensitivity to Ang-(1-7), its antagonism by [Sar 1 -Thr 8 ]-Ang II and [D-Ala 7 ]-Ang-(1-7), and its lack of response to AT 1 or AT 2 receptor antagonists, either functionally or in competition for binding.",

            "text": "Recently, Santos et al. (65) reported that the orphan G protein-coupled receptor mas is an Ang-(1-7) receptor. Ang-(1-7) bound with high affinity to cells transfected with the mas receptor, which was blocked by [D-Ala 7 ]-Ang-(1-7), and renal or depressor responses to Ang-(1-7) were lost in mas-depleted mice. We recently showed that antisense oligonucleotides or siRNAs to mas prevent the Ang-(1-7)-mediated inhibition of growth in VSMCs, which is also blocked by [D-Ala 7 ]-Ang-(1-7) (116). These results suggest that the mas receptor serves as a selective Ang-(1-7) binding site. Fig. 4 shows the signal transduction pathway by which Ang-(1-7) activates the G protein-coupled mas receptor to increase the production of NO and prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) via increases in cGMP and cAMP, respectively. Ang-(1-7) also reduces the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) by either increasing MAPK phosphatases or reducing the MAPK kinase MEK. The increase in cAMP and cGMP and the decrease in MAPK activity cause vasodilation and inhibit cell growth. The mas receptor is predominantly expressed in the testis and the hippocampus and amygdala of the mammalian forebrain with minimal levels in the rodent heart and kidney. This tissue distribution differs from previous reports of Ang-(1-7) binding and functional responses, suggesting the existence of other AT (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) receptors.",

            "text": "Ang-(1-7), a product of both Ang I and Ang II metabolisms, functions to antagonize the actions of Ang II by acting primarily through binding to a non-AT 1 /AT 2 receptor and also the mas receptor. Ang-(1-7) stimulates vasodilation through increased production of vasodilator prostaglandins and NO, as well as amplifying the intrinsic actions of bradykinin. In the kidney, Ang-(1-7) promotes natriuresis and diuresis through an effect on transport mechanisms involved in water and electrolyte absorption within the renal tubules and collecting ducts. In addition, Ang-(1-7) modulates the actions of tubular vasopressin via an effect on its V2 receptor. In the heart, Ang-(1-7) counteracts the hypertrophic, pro-fibrotic, and pro-thrombotic effects of Ang II as well as increases myocardial blood flow. Ang-(1-7) contributes to the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors and Ang II antagonists by several mechanisms (84, 117, 118, 119) . Inhibition of ACE increases blood and tissue concentrations of Ang-(1-7) by preventing ACE-mediated Ang-(1-7) degradation and increasing substrate (Ang I) availability. In contrast, blockade of Ang II receptors increases blood and tissue levels of Ang-(1-7) by: (i) increasing Ang I substrate availability through the dis-inhibition of Ang II-mediated renin release, and (ii) augmenting the rate of Ang II conversion into Ang-(1-7) via increased ACE2 expression and activity. Both ACE and ACE2 represent critical steps at which modulation of angiotensin peptide functions are precisely regulated, the specific mechanisms of which need further investigation. Genomic studies are also urgently needed to determine whether polymorphisms in the ACE2 gene or the genes for Ang-(1-7)-forming enzymes exist.",
