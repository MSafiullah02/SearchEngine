In this chapter, we describe conventional and real-time one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays that are routinely used in our laboratory to detect either genotype 1 or genotype 2 ferret coronavirus in clinical specimens. These assays were designed based upon the conserved spike gene sequence difference found between three strains of ferret systemic coronavirus and three strains of ferret enteric coronavirus. Recent literature evidence indicates that pathotype is not associated with a specifi c genotype, and therefore, it is important to test for both genotypes either in enteric or systemic disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE), an enteric disease of domestic ferrets was fi rst described in the USA in 1993 [ 1 ] . Clinically, the disease is characterized by a foul-smelling bright green diarrhea with high mucus content, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. Morbidity approaches 100 %, but mortality is usually below 5 %, with juvenile ferrets often developing only mild disease. ECE was found to be associated with an alphacoronavirus, designated ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) [ 2 ] . This disease or the enteric coronavirus agent associated with it has since spread in the USA and other countries worldwide [ 3 -5 ] . Close to a decade after the recognition of ECE, a systemic disease, characterized by feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-like clinical signs and lesions, began to emerge in ferrets across the USA and Europe [ 6 -9 ] . Clinical fi ndings include anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea and the presence of large palpable intra-abdominal masses. A marked resemblance to FIP is the gross observation of widespread whitish nodules on serosal surfaces and within the parenchyma of abdominal and thoracic organs. A systemic pyogranulomatous infl ammation is the consistent histologic lesion observed in the affected organs, reminiscent of FIP. The agent associated with this disease, was found to be another alphacoronavirus, designated, ferret systemic coronavirus or FRSCV, and is most closely related to FRECV [ 6 , 10 ] . The disease continues to spread worldwide with more recent reports from the UK, France and Japan [ 11 -14 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 121, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 490, "end": 495, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 621, "end": 629, "text": "[ 3 -5 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 839, "end": 847, "text": "[ 6 -9 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1441, "text": "[ 6 , 10 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1551, "text": "[ 11 -14 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Comparative sequence analysis of the distal one-third of the genomes of one FRSCV and one FRECV strain [ 10 ] showed that these two viruses share at least 96 % nucleotide sequence identities in the membrane, nucleocapsid and non-structural protein genes, ORFs 3 and 7b. However, their spike (S) proteins showed only 79.6 % amino acid sequence identity. This allowed the development of two S genotype -specifi c conventional [ 10 ] , as well as realtime RT-PCR assays [ 15 ] for routine detection of these viruses in our laboratory. Limited preliminary data have shown that genotype 1 (FRSCV-like) ferret coronaviruses were found associated with the systemic type of illness while genotype 2 (FRECV-like) ferret coronaviruses were detected in cases of ECE [ 10 ] . Recent literature evidence indicates that there is no association between the S genotype and virus pathotype [ 4 , 5 ] . The differentiating genotype-specifi c RT-PCR assays were recently used in a study that determined the prevalence of coronavirus among domestic ferrets in Japan [ 5 ] . The investigators noted that the majority of ferrets that were shedding the genotype 1 ferret coronavirus in feces were not ill with the systemic disease and that some were even asymptomatic. In the Netherlands, partial spike gene sequence analysis reported by Provacia et al. [ 4 ] showed that genotype 1 ferret coronavirus strains were also found present in feces of asymptomatic ferrets. These fi ndings bring to mind the \"in vivo mutation\" theory proposed by Chang et al. [ 16 ] and Pedersen [ 17 ] for FIPinducing feline coronavirus strains. It may well be the case for ferret coronaviruses that the virus commonly found in normal feces may just be the \"precursor\" to a more pathogenic strain. Wise et al. [ 10 ] noted the presence of a truncated 3c-like protein gene in two out of three genotype 1 strains identifi ed in ferrets with systemic disease, reminiscent of the 3c gene mutations identifi ed in FIP viruses in cats [ 16 -18 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 109, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 424, "end": 430, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 467, "end": 473, "text": "[ 15 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 755, "end": 761, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 873, "end": 882, "text": "[ 4 , 5 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1051, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1336, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1536, "text": "[ 16 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1556, "text": "[ 17 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1771, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1984, "end": 1994, "text": "[ 16 -18 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is a method to amplify a fragment of double-stranded DNA to millions of copies, based upon repeated cycles of double-stranded DNA template denaturation, primer annealing and elongation. A primer is a short singlestranded DNA sequence, also called an oligonucleotide, that \"primes\" the reaction at the appropriate annealing temperature by binding to the complementary sequence of the denatured DNA target. Using the deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) in the reaction, the Taq polymerase enzyme then catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotides to polynucleotides beginning at the 3\u2032 end of the primer in the elongation step. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) is used when the original target template is RNA, such that the RNA is fi rst reverse-transcribed into \"copy DNA,\" or cDNA, by the reverse transcriptase enzyme. The cDNA is then amplifi ed in the PCR step. Conventional PCR/RT-PCR [ 19 -22 ] requires the visualization of the amplifi ed DNA or the PCR product, in an agarose gel matrix submerged in buffer through the process of electrophoresis. Electrophoresis subjects the PCR product to an electric current fl ow in the buffer that causes the DNA to migrate through the gel matrix according to its molecular weight. The PCR product is stained with an intercalating dye that fl uoresces upon exposure to UV light, enabling its visualization alongside a DNA size marker ladder.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 940, "end": 950, "text": "[ 19 -22 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In real-time PCR / RT-PCR [ 19 -22 ] , the amplifi ed DNA or the amplicon, is detected and recorded in \"real-time\" during the assay itself. With a hydrolysis probe-based real-time PCR, also called a \"Taqman\"-probe based assay, the amplifi cation of DNA in every cycle results to a steady buildup of fl uorescence signal in the reaction that can be detected using a specialized thermocycler with a built-in real-time nucleic acid detection system (e.g., Cepheid SmartCycler system). The probe, an essential component of the reaction mix, is a synthetic oligonucleotide with a sequence complementary to the target DNA fl anked by the primers. The probe is labeled at its 5\u2032 end with a fl uorescent reporter dye (e.g., FAM) and with a fl uorescence quencher (e.g., BHQ-1) at its 3\u2032 end. There is no fl uorescent signal emitted as long as the probe remains intact. In the presence of the specifi c target DNA in the reaction, after the primers and probe anneal to their complementary sequence, polymerization takes place in the elongation phase of the PCR cycle, during which the probe is degraded via the 5\u2032 exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase. Probe degradation leads to the release of the reporter dye from the probe and from its proximity to the quencher molecule, resulting to the accumulation of fl uorescence signal in the reaction mix at every PCR cycle.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 26, "end": 36, "text": "[ 19 -22 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "1.
