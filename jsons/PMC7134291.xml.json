            "text": "Mobile technology evolution and the extensive diffusion of mobile phones in performing several functions and tasks, has led to the phenomenal growth in the ownership of mobile phones globally. Notable among these everyday tasks is the use of mobile phones in making payments for goods and services without the need for cash or participation of banking institutions (Li\u00e9bana-Cabanillas and Lara-Rubio 2017; Dahlberg et al. 2015; Chandra et al. 2010). This rising interest in mobile payment usage from the consumer to the merchants has become a strategic tool that facilitates positive business outcomes (Congdon 2016). Further, this innovative payment solution is considered a bedrock for competitive advantage, productivity, and growth, providing a way for businesses to achieve efficiency (Hsiao 2019). The high penetration of mobile payments within society, its accessibility and ease of use has led to experts classifying mobile payments as the potential payment of choice (Li\u00e9bana-Cabanillas and Lara-Rubio 2017; Cabanillas et al. 2016). This makes mobile payments deployment relevant to the growth and development of businesses across the world (Oliveira et al. 2016). More importantly in developing countries, the mobile payment revolution is transforming households and businesses by providing a business solution to small and medium-sized businesses as well as mobile phone-related financial services to the underserved population, and help developing economies leapfrog poor non-existing payment infrastructure (Asongu et al. 2018).",

Current studies on mobile payments have mostly explored technology and consumer adoption especially their implementation (Miao and Jayakar 2016; Madan and Yadav 2016). While consumer adoption studies are important in understanding mobile payments systems, researchers are of the view that an investigation of consumer adoption in isolation will not provide a full understanding of mobile payments (Dahlberg et al. 2015).",

However, mobile payments, transactions can occur among unknown entities, since mobile payments are regarded as a type of an online transaction completed over a mobile network and an accepted progression from electronic payment systems. This makes trust a significant facilitator for the merchant adoption of mobile payment (Rouibah et al. 2016). Therefore, this study seeks to understand the merchant adoption of m-payment systems and explore the trust-theoretic perspective to examine the enablers of merchant trust in mobile payment systems (Mallat 2007). The questions underpinning the study are: what is the enabler of merchant trust and what is the role of merchant trust in m-payment adoption. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The next section reviews the literature on mobile payments and briefly discusses the theoretical underpinnings. The third section presents the conceptual framework guiding the study; the section that follows details the methodology employed. Subsequently, the findings are analysed, and discussions of the findings presented. Finally, the paper concludes with specific contributions and directions for future research.",

            "text": "The concept of trust has attracted a considerable amount of research due to its significant role in information systems research, especially in the e-commerce environment. Mobile payments, which are a kind of online transaction, involve virtuality, anonymity and temporal and spatial separation, which can lead to considerable uncertainty and risk. Therefore, trust is very relevant for mobile payment technology adoption. According to Zhou (2013) merchants usually have concerns about security when it comes to the use of mobile payment. Nevertheless, merchants consider trust in payment services providers and the security of mobile payment solutions as necessary criteria for the adoption of mobile payment. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate trust in examining the merchant adoption of mobile payments (Zhou 2013). Therefore, in the mobile payment environment, the two enablers of merchant trust consist of trust in provider of mobile service as well as trust in technology-enhanced by characteristics of the service provider and characteristics of the mobile technology (Chandra et al. 2010; Broutsou and Fitsilis 2012).",

This can be likened to the concept of the \u201chalo effect\u201d. The concept of the halo effect is based on the explanation that an individual\u2019s perception or views about a product or a person is based on previous experiences and the sort of interpretation which leads to cognitive bias. For instance, one can explain that Apple\u2019s other products are successful and people have confidence in it, due to the positive influence and how successful iPod was (Chong et al. 2018; Wilcox 2008). Thus, merchant perceptions on MSP as fair and honest translates to beliefs and trust for the mobile payment system controlled by the MSP. Research demonstrates that based on the halo effect, merchant trust has a positive relationship with the perceived reputation of the provider of the service, which leads to trusting beliefs in the merchant.\n",

In other words, if a merchant perceived a very useful structural assurance, it will increase the level of merchant trust in mobile payment systems. Zhou (2013) and Dahlberg et al.

Henceforth, merchants will adopt m-payment systems that are easy to use and will be perceived as useful. There are several benefits of M-payment systems to merchants irrespective of place and time, self-regulating transactions, which leads to effective payment transactions to the merchant. Thus, leading to an expectation that because merchant regards the mobile payment as a useful tool in achieving their purpose, they will adopt.

The descriptive case study approach was used to enable theory to guide the data collection process (Yin 2009); as a result, the trust-theoretic stance and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were reviewed as the theory underpinning the case study design (Chandra et al. 2010).

            "text": "This assertion by merchants portrays mobile payment as potentially having significant technological risk. As such, merchants are skeptical about their information with the service provider because mobile payment is a wireless network and is susceptible to hacker attacks and intruders, which can affect transactional security. Merchants were particularly concerned about privacy, security, fraud, payment transaction errors and potential loss of cash. As a result, they did not always feel very confident in using the mobile payment for their transactions. The merchants interviewed think that mobile payment can be trusted but the risk associated with it, impacts negatively on their trust and influence their attitude which they consider a barrier to adoption of mobile payment.\u201cWe get all kind of calls supposedly coming from providers but it turns out to be intruders who are able to generate codes, that should be coming from service providers which are a little bit suspicious if merchant information ends up with third parties\u201d As alluded by the operations director\u201cI think the encryptions back to back are not strong enough because fraudsters are able to wipe people\u2019s wallet without knowing the merchant code. I don\u2019t feel safe with the telecom company because they do not understand the banking rudiment; I will feel safe if these services are run by the banks\u201d a statement by the operations Director\n",

These findings support proposition 3 in the model. Additionally, the findings from the case study demonstrate that merchants are able to build confidence and sufficient trust in mobile payment systems because of structural assurance such as encryption, authentication and third-party certifications by their service providers. For example, the use of message authentication code, assures merchants and their clients that information is not tampered during transferring via networks. This ensures confidentiality, anonymity, and integrity (see Yang and Lin 2016; Xin et al. 2013). This, to a large extent, ensures the safety of the system. \u201cI know that when I initiate a transaction nobody will be able to intercept it midway has and it gets to its destination because there is encryption for a transaction\u201d as intimated by the CEO.",
