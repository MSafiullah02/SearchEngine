In addition, countries like the U.S. can no longer avoid the fact that continued economic success is predicated on international trade. Many products, such as oil and other basic raw materials, must be imported; often cost-effective components assembled in foreign countries are critical for the production of domestic finished goods. Finally, there can be no denying that certain imported products are here to stay.

The U.S. has countered by refocusing its efforts at increasing exports, not only with the major industrialized nations, but also with developing countries on a bi-lateral basis.

As companies seek to export products not only to major trading partners but also to markets dispersed throughout the world, logistics costs involved in international warehousing and transportation are critical in holding down prices and assuring tolerable margins. In addition, as many U.S. companies seek to source components or relocate their operations overseas, corporate planners are having to formulate logistics strategies that will guarantee the smooth and efficient flow of materials and products through the domestic and international distribution pipeline. In summary, the goal of these movements toward regional trading blocs is to reduce tariffs and customs requirements, streamline and standardize shipping documentation, and establish compatible transportation and material handling systems that enable countries belonging to a regional trade union to act as if they were a single commercial entity.",

The massive changes brought about by such events as the creation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Market (IMM), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), have enabled establishment of global financial standards, the extension and guarantee of long-term import/export credits beyond individual bank capabilities, and the mechanism to exchange currencies and trade futures at market rates. The decision of the U.S. to drop the gold standard in the early 1970s has assisted in removing previous restrictions on the setting of monetary rates. In addition, the adoption of the Euro in 2002 has greatly facilitated the flow of global trade by providing another stable medium of exchange. While currency issues surround the Yuan and Ruble and talk of an alternate basket of currencies, financial markets so far have been content to rely on the U.S. dollar and the euro as the standard mediums of exchange.",

The decision of the U.S. in the early 1980s to deregulate transportation has been slowly but steadily expanding across the globe. Historically, governments rather than market forces determined the scope and price of transportation. Many nations did not allow foreign-owned carriers to operate within their borders. Many transport modes, such as the current rail system in Mexico, are still state owned or, as in Germany, a mixture of state-owned and private companies subsidized by the government. Today, removal of these barriers to free-market drivers in most industrialized nations have followed U.S. example. UPS, for example, currently operates via any combination of rail, motor, air, or water in over 190 countries in a seamless manner via ownership, joint marketing, and operating agreements. Beyond operating privileges and privatization, changes in cabotage (requirement that goods and passengers within a country only use domestic carriers) have been gradually relaxed, especially between countries in the European Union and NAFTA.",

Today, with the growth of competitors, both domestic and foreign, focused on price parity and value-added features, such as quality and service, vertical organizations cannot hope to sustain their previous market dominance without business partners.

These global LSPs provide continuity and visibility to the logistics needs of customers across the entire supply chain, rather than dependence on individual players who perform narrow local transactions and then pass shipments on to the next channel partner. The goal is to provide customers with technology tools to control the global supply chain by enabling them to manage both the velocity and delivery points of goods as they move across global networks.

Perhaps the biggest barrier is global competitors that are supported by local governments. For example, even giant UPS cannot compete with the world's largest global shipping concern, Deutsche Post DHL, which draws financial support about (25 %) from the German government.",

Typically, the home company will pursue financial integration of the different regions where trade is performed, with less emphasis on integrating product development, marketing, and supply chain management and planning.

The second strategic dimension involves assessing organizational strengths and weaknesses. A firm understanding of this strategic area enables global planners to deal effectively with opportunities, threats, and global trends.

Before detailed market analysis begins, however, it is important that the firm defines its international marketing objectives and policies. This process normally consists of three parts. To begin with, global planners must determine the desired proportion of foreign sales to total sales. This ratio depends on product, competition, logistics channel requirements, and market-place aspirations. Second, planners choose between marketing and distributing to a few target countries or to many countries. Generally, it makes sense to begin first by selecting a few countries in which a strong commitment and significant product penetration can occur. Finally, the firm must decide on the types of countries with which they would like to do business with.

There is a very real difference between entering into a US$10 million and a US$100,000 million marketplace. Another factor is whether the target market is stable or growing. A market in which the exporter can become a major player will require a strategy different from one where the size of the competition inhibits the exporter from being nothing more than a niche player. Another important factor is the type of product being offered. A product line competing on high quality and cost with a long life cycle will require a different entry strategy than an exporter that sells commodities or products with a short life cycle. Finally, global entry strategies are affected by the infrastructure of the local country, the sophistication of trading partners, and the overall culture and receptiveness of the local market to imported products and services.",

Active exporting, on the other hand, occurs as part of a strategic decision to expand sales into foreign markets. Regardless of the policy, exporting as a method of approaching foreign markets has the least impact on company product lines, distribution channels, internal organization, investment, and enterprise mission.

For example, the local producer can modify products or services to meet local tastes and customs while the licensor retains control of the brand name, quality standards, and so on. Also, licensing normally does not require a great deal of capital investment. Like exporting strategies, licensing provides licensors with a less risky method of gaining access to foreign markets than direct ownership, while providing sufficient flexibility to cancel unprofitable arrangements. On the negative side, the licensor has less control over the licensee than if the firm had established a directly-owned business. If the licensee does not live up to the terms of the contract, all the licensor can do is threaten to end the agreement. Finally, if the licensor decides to cancel the contract, they might find that they have not only lost control but have created a competitor with a strong market position in a foreign country where the licensor might subsequently find it difficult to penetrate on their own.",

One is to execute a management contract in which a licensor sells management services for a fee to a foreign company to assist in managing a factory, distribution center, hospital, or other organization. Management contracts are low-risk methods of gaining entrance to a foreign market, especially if the contracting firm provides an option to purchase a portion of the business. Another method is contract manufacturing. In this method a firm licenses and agrees to assist a foreign company produce or distribute its products. Although licensing has the drawback of potential loss of control over processes, it does provide the firm with the opportunity of partnership or acquisition if the market matures. Perhaps the most recognizable form of licensing is franchising. In this model, the licensor offers a complete brand and marketing concept and a mature operating and structural format. In exchange, the licensee must buy product and infrastructure from the licensor and pay a royalty or fee.",

Depending on the nature of the trade agreements, the product could traverse a variety of intermediaries from FTZs, to local brokers and LSPs, to customer distribution channels. For example, to sell soap in Japan, Proctor & Gamble must sell through a labyrinth of intermediaries starting with sales to a general wholesaler, who sells to a product wholesaler, who sells to a regional wholesaler, who sells to a local wholesaler, who finally sells to retailers [16] . At the end point of the global trade network is final delivery to the customer. In a classic article, Picard [17] segmented global channels into four systems. These systems cut across the channel strategies described above. In the first system ( Figure 14 .5), products are shipped directly from the home country to intermediaries or customers in a single foreign market. The advantages of this system are that there is no need for foreign warehousing or shipment consolidation and there is less product in the distribution channel. A serious drawback of this system is the accompanying long lead times and delivery costs for customer delivery. In addition, the length of the supply line renders the shipment subject to possible disruption and delay. Finally, the packaging and documentation costs associated with this system are normally higher than for the other three systems. The second channel system (Figure 14 .6) attempts to solve some of the problems of the direct system by interposing a shipment consolidation center in between the domestic warehouse or producer and the foreign market. The purpose of the consolidation center is to decrease the overall cost of transportation and shorten service lead-times. Product can be shipped from the home country in bulk and then converted (bulk break) into individual customer orders and stocking units and distributed within the foreign market.",

In the third system ( Figure 14.7) , inventory is shipped from the home country to a stocking warehouse located within the foreign market. The benefits of this arrangement are obvious. Delivery to the foreign warehouse can be done in bulk and with slower transportation modes, thereby decreasing shipping costs; order lead times are shorter that in the first two systems; customers have greater flexibility in product and quantity selection; and, because the shipment is really an intracompany transfer, the costs associated with tariffs and documentation are reduced.

Market-related issues refer to the number and size of the foreign customer base, level of expected service, sales volume, quality of foreign intermediary or company-owned distribution channels, fitness of product, and prospects for growth. Export-related factors center on export marketing strategy, sophistication of intermediaries, and firm size. Foreign environment issues focus on sophistication of global channel infrastructure, political and economic stability, degree of government regulation and customs constraints, and the presence of strong, costeffective foreign partners and transit contractors. By using these key factors, planners have the ability to develop several different global channel systems. For instance, a direct channel system could be used to supply bulk shipments to large foreign customers, whereas a multicountry approach could be employed simultaneously to penetrate several different countries supplied from a central foreign warehouse.

As discussed previously, such a department normally consists of an export clerk, a sales manager, and a few assistants, or it can be a complex business unit with expanded roles and service offerings. Exporting departments can be indirect, contracting with domestic or foreign wholesalers or distributors, or direct, shipping product directly to foreign buyers. If a company decides to expand beyond just exporting and importing goods into more complicated global trade activities, such as licensing, joint ventures, or direct ownership, they will need to establish an international division. This organization is staffed by dedicated global trade specialists capable of provide a wide array of services to various operating units. According to Kotler and Keller [18] the division could be organized in several ways. They could be formed as a geographical organization reporting to a regional country vicepresident responsible for the salesforce, branches, distributors, and licensees in the local country. Another option would be to organize the division into world product groups. In this format, each operating unit would have a national vice president responsible for worldwide sales of the corporation's product groups. Finally, operating units could be organized as international subsidiaries, each with a president reporting to the president of the international division.",

This option is the less costly, as little or no modification is made to the product and global marketing strategy. On the other hand, marketers might pursue a customized approach in which the product and distribution support structure is tailored to meet the needs of local markets.

Similar to the process of determining domestic prices, global prices are set in accordance with the price-setting behavior of competitors, customers' ability to buy in various national markets, strategic cost and profit goals, place of product in the product life cycle, and local legal and pricing regulatory environments. At the base of international pricing is the problem of price escalation. For example, a product made in the U.S. would sell in the domestic market for US$100, but in Europe the price might escalate to US$205. The difference between the two prices is the cost to the exporter for transportation, tariffs, importer margins, wholesale margins, and retailer margins above the factory cost. To solve this problem, exporters have three options. A company may, first of all, establish a uniform price for all markets. When pursuing this policy, all nations, whether rich or poor, would pay the same price. A second method would be to set a market-based price in each trading country. In this strategy, the firm would charge what each country could bear. Finally, a firm may pursue a cost-based price in each country. Selling price would be cost plus a standard markup.

Dumping occurs when a company charges less than cost or less than what it charges in the domestic market in order to enter or win a market. When such abuses are caught, various governments force the subsidiary to charge the arm's-length price or the same price as being charged by local competitors. Another pricing problem occurring when a distributor in a low-cost country buys excess product and diverts some of the quantities to a high-cost country to capitalize on higher prices (termed the gray market).

When using delivered pricing, the shipper's price includes not only the price of the goods but the cost of transport, customs, tariffs, insurance, documentation, and other expenses. Delivered price provides certain advantages. To begin with, the seller gains control over the distribution process, thereby ensuring customer service and pricing competitiveness.",

These issues are concerned with such factors as cash flow and currency conversion, fluctuating cost for inventory, the role of government, and methods of payment. Without a doubt, cash flow is of prime importance. Typically, global companies need a great deal of working capital to pay for plant and equipment, transportation services, inventories, and credit. Much of the reason lies in the great distances goods have to travel and the normal administrative delays encountered in foreign trade. Even when the transactions are relatively simple, customs clearance, the transfer of international payment documents, government restrictions, and shipment disputes can hold up payment. In addition, variations in the rate of currency exchange can severely impact capital planning. This is particularly true when it is considered that the value of the currency upon which the price was based could devalue between the time of shipment and the time of delivery. For this reason, very few global transactions are financed by payment in advance or cash on delivery. Besides cash flow issues, currency variation will have an effect on local costs associated with warehousing, labor, transportation, information processing, and other costs. Finally, there are also potential collection issues arising from inadequate credit reports on customers, problems of currency exchange controls, distance, different legal systems, and the cost and difficulty of collecting delinquent accounts.",

In some ways, a GTM solution can be considered as simply supply chain management applications with a world-wide reach. As illustrated in Figure 14 .9, a GTM system links the exporter's ERP/WMS systems to a set of software applications that enable global trade departments to optimize, automate, and monitor transactions with trading partners and service providers. Transaction data used by the exporter, its vendors, LSPs, customers, and other trading partners flows through a central GTM platform. The flow of data, in turn, triggers other transactions and the system ensures each party receives the information it requires. For example, an international importer might use GTM functionality to transmit purchase orders, share information with suppliers, book transportation, track shipments, and perform several other activities involved in global procurement and moving goods.",

As illustrated in Figure 14 .10, the first step is to identify that a foreign source is necessary or economically feasible for the procurement of raw materials, a component, or a finished good. This step could be undertaken for a variety of reasons: product unavailability in the domestic market, requirements for a higher level of quality than can be found from domestic suppliers, search for alternate suppliers other than domestic sources, and search for lower-cost alternatives. In addition, more detailed criteria, such as the length of the supply line, strategy for supplier partnership and involvement, stability of product design, completeness of engineering documentation, length of the product life cycle, superiority of production methods, necessary materials and tooling, and terms and conditions of contracts, are also critical criteria that must be determined ahead of any outsourcing negotiation. As procurement planners begin to map out the first leg of the process, it is critical that they also detail the drawbacks as well as the advantages of international sourcing. In most cases, purchasing from foreign sources is a good deal more difficult than buying from domestic sources, requiring the ability to solve not only the same kind of problems encountered in domestic procurement but also problems accentuated by language, culture, currency, transportation, and government regulations. The contrast between domestic and global purchasing are illustrated in Table 14 .4.

There are several strategies purchasers can use to counter currency fluctuations. The most radical approach is to insist that negotiation and payment be executed in the home currency. Another alternative is for buyer and seller to split fluctuations in value either 50/50 or by some other agreed upon formula. Many buyers will negotiate a price along with a variance, say of plus or minus 5 %. If the price exceeds the variance threshold, buyer and seller would equally share in the variance.

Tariffs are used by countries as a method for revenue generation, a device to protect domestic industries, and a means to discourage the importation of certain products. There are three major types of tariffs: ad valorem, specific, and compound. Ad valorem, the type of tariff most applied, is calculated as a percentage of the appraised value of the goods received. A specific tariff is defined as a specified amount per unit weight or other unit of measurement. For example, $0.20 per gross. Finally, a compound tariff is calculated as a combination of both an ad valorem and a specific rate. The payment of tariffs can be delayed by warehousing goods in a free-trade zone. Tariffs are not paid on the goods until they are removed from the free-trade zone and sold. Another method used by firms that re-export products is a duty drawback. The drawback provides for a 99 % refund of ordinary customs duties paid when the goods were originally received.",

This exercise should detail international sourcing requirements, the methods to be followed for achieving these requirements, and how the strategy is to be aligned with and supportive of overall enterprise goals. The second step is the organization of an international purchasing function whose role is to gather information and evaluate opportunities, as well as execute the activities associated with managing global channel inventories, foreign negotiations, pricing, and delivery issues. This department can be organized several ways, including the use of a resident foreign purchasing office, import broker, merchant or international trading company, or formal structure within the corporate purchasing function. Third, the international purchasing organization needs to be closely integrated with other company and channel functions. This will assure that individual departmental objectives as well as the supply chain strategy are effectively supported.

The most obvious differences are found in the long distances goods are transported, heavy reliance on intermodal transport methods, and interaction with foreign companies and governments.

A favorable balance of payments occurs when more goods are exported than imported into a country. The objective is to ensure that more \"hard\" cash is entering the country than leaving it. Beyond fiscal concerns about product, pivotal to this strategy is the possession of viable transportation modes that span global boarders. To this end, governments will subsidize the growth of local carriers with international capabilities to ensure that as large a portion as possible of exports and imports are carried in home country transport modes. Also, nations sometimes have cargo preference laws requiring that certain types of goods can only be carried by domestic carriers. For example, all military supplies and cargoes arising from U.S. government appropriations, such as charitable foodstuffs being sent to foreign lands, must be carried in U.S. vessels. Transportation services may even themselves be considered an export product that is offered to the global community. For nations wishing to engage in cross-border trading, the possession of a diverse transportation fleet acts as an additional competitive advantage when engaging in global trade. An example is the huge advantage enjoyed by China in maritime shipping, considered a backbone of Chinese economic growth. Cross-border trading occurs when a country's maritime vessels or aircraft is contracted to transport products of other nations. Some nations have attempted to control cross-border trading by a pooling agreement. Such agreements require that all or part of the products moving between the agreeing countries must be transported by their own international carriers.",

In such cases, the surface shipment requires a combination of more than one of the five transportation modes. As introduced in Chapter 13, the basis of intermodal forms of transportation resides in the development of systems that integrate or combine together various elements of the five modes of transportation. For example, a U.S. shipment to Asia might require containerization of the goods, motor carriage to a local rail siding where the container is loaded onto a flatbed car, delivery to a West coast port where the container is loaded on ocean transport, and arrival in China where rail and motor carriage are again used to complete the delivery.",

Whether packed in a container, rigid boxes, shrink wrapped pallets, or other packing forms, unitization is significantly more efficient than handling loose individual products.

While in the U.S. trucking is primarily used for domestic transportation, in other parts of the world it is vital to international trade. For example, in 2009 more than 70 % of EU crossborder trade was by motor carrier. Drawbacks are traversing the great amount of rules and regulations involved in cross-border trucking, state of local infrastructures, fuel taxation, and capabilities of local rail service. Tractor trailers are, in essence, a form of self-mobile or partially mobile container. When used in an intermodal fashion, trailers can be accompanied by a tractor or shipped alone. In the latter case, the trailer is usually loaded aboard a rail car or canal or ocean vessel and sent \"piggyback\" to the next terminal, where it is then transferred to another form of transportation. Besides advantages associated with handling, trailers pass relatively easily through customs, thereby reducing lead times and speeding overall trailer utilization. Disadvantages to utilizing trailers are the cost of operating the tractors and paying for drivers and other support staff.

The most common types of container vessel are Panamax ships (capable of transiting the Panama Canal); New Panamax ships (carrying 15,000 containers and capable of transiting the New Panama Canal); and Post New Panamx ships (reaching 18,000 containers). Containers moving between the Far East and Europe often make use of the landbridge route across the United States.

Landbridges have the advantage of dramatically reducing transit time by avoiding much slower and often circuitous water routes, and increasing the utilization of containerships. A variation of container vessels are Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) and Roll-on/Roll-Off (RO/RO) vessels.

There are three basic types of service provided by ocean vessels: liner, tramp, and industrial carriage. Liner service provides scheduled for-hire carriage for general goods between ports based on published freight rates. Ocean general cargo (or break-bulk liner) rates are set by shipping conferences. A conference is an organization consisting of all vessel owners operating in a common shipment lane who have legally agreed not to compete on price and agree to charge the same rate for the same type of cargo and the same voyage. A common rate or tariff is published for each commodity and is to be charged by all members of the conference. Tramp services are offered by vessels that literally \"tramp\" from port to port looking for freight. Tramp vessels do not follow established schedules or routes, and rates are established by individual charters with shippers. This type of service is used by most of the world's bulk freighters, tankers, and seagoing barges. The final type of service is industrial carriage.

Although even the largest cargo aircraft has a tonnagecarrying capacity of about 1 % of a fairly small break-bulk ocean vessel, it can make a delivery within a few hours or a few days that would take an ocean vessel several weeks. International air carriers are normally used to transport small quantities of high-value, low-weight, semifinished and finished goods. Typical products include computers, extreme seasonal and perishable commodities, products sensitive to fashion, precision instruments, and electronics. Often, such products would never be able to find their way into foreign markets without air transportation. The negative side to air transport is obviously the cost for aircraft, maintenance and repair, terminal fees, and facilities costs. Recently, airline transport was significantly challenged by the recession of 2009, the continuously rising cost of fuel, and the threat of terrorism. In addition, the limited storage capacity of aircraft and the inability to carry many types of products limit its use to all but emergency-type deliveries.",

Similar to ocean transport, air offers two modes: scheduled and charter. Using scheduled air consists of two options. The first is using freight space in the \"belly\" of passenger flights (United, American) and the second is all-cargo air freighters (FedEx and the USPS). When using this mode, shippers have the benefit of planning delivery almost anywhere in the world by consulting the published routes of commercial airlines. The second mode is a charter flight. Companies can charter an aircraft from a variety of private and commercial services. Although chartering an aircraft is expensive, it could be justified for the shipment of a product whose nature or demand requires extreme reduction in transit time over other forms of carriage. Theoretically, tariffs follow the guidelines established by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a cartel consisting of almost all of the world's airlines. In practice, rates are based on the principle of charging what the market will bear. Tariffs are normally charged on the basis of volume or weight, whichever is higher.",

One strategy is to export products into foreign markets from domestic sources passively through the use of a domestic intermediary, or actively by seeking out intermediaries in foreign countries. A second possible avenue is licensing. In this strategy a company (the licensor) agrees to permit a company (the licensee) the right to use a production process, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other skill or technology in exchange for a royalty or fee. Another strategy, joint venture, differs from simple exporting in that the firm invests and is directly involved in the management of a foreign enterprise. The final strategy is direct ownership of a company located in a foreign country. Once the international channel strategy is defined, it must be effectively managed. Maintenance of a global channel is a complex affair involving most of the decisions required to run domestic functions, plus additional requirements associated with the realities of international trade. Of critical importance is the management of international transportation and warehousing. Transportation is essential in delivering the product through the distribution channel to foreign destinations and warehousing with consolidating and storing it on its way to the customer.",

United States domestic standard containers are generally 48 ft (15 m) and 53 ft (rail and truck). Container capacity is often expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU). An equivalent unit is a measure of containerized cargo capacity equal to one standard 20 ft (length) \u00c2 8 ft (width) container. As this is an approximate measure, the height of the box is not considered; for instance the 9-ft 6 in. (2.9 m) high cube and the 4-ft 3-in. (1.3 m) half height 20-ft (6.1 m) containers are also called one TEU. The maximum gross mass for a 20-ft (6.1 m) dry cargo container is 24,000 kg, and for a 40-ft (including the 2.87 m (9 ft 6 in.) high cube container), it is 30,480 kg. Allowing for the tare mass of the container, the maximum payload is therefore reduced to approximately 22,000 kg. for 20-ft (6.1 m) and 27,000 kg. for 40-ft (12 m) containers.",
