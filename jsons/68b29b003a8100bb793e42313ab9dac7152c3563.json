To study paramyxovirus-mediated fusion, we mutated the SV5 fusion (F) protein at conserved residues L447 and I449, which are adjacent to heptad repeat (HR) B and bind to a prominent cavity in the HRA trimeric coiled coil in the fusogenic six-helix bundle (6HB) structure. These analyses on residues L447 and I449, both in intact F protein and in 6HB, suggest a metamorphic region around these residues M with dual structural roles. Mutation of L447 and I449 to aliphatic residues destabilizes the 6HB structure and attenuates fusion activity. Mutation of L447 and I449 to aromatic residues also destabilizes the 6HB structure despite promoting hyperactive fusion, indicating that 6HB stability alone does not dictate fusogenicity. Thus, residues L447 and I449 adjacent to HRB in paramyxovirus F have distinct roles in fusion activation and 6HB formation, suggesting this region is involved in a conformational switch.",

            "text": "Membrane fusion is a process central to biology that requires both the precise triggering of macromolecular assemblies and the metamorphosis of individual fusion protein machines. Membrane coalescence promoted by protein hairpin formation is a fusion mechanism shared by the type I viral fusion-mediating glycoproteins (vFGps) of retroviruses, lentiviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses Eckert and Kim, 2001) . Type I vFGps are homotrimeric proteins that have to be cleaved by a protease to yield a metastable complex of membrane-distal and membrane-anchored subunits (for paramyxoviruses, the F 0 precursor is cleaved to F 1 \u03e9 F 2 ; Fig.  1 ). The membrane-anchored subunits contain two hydrophobic domains, the fusion peptide and the transmembrane (TM) domain, each one adjacent to one of two conserved heptad repeat (HR) regions, designated HRA and HRB, respectively. Upon triggering by low pH or by receptor/ coreceptor binding, the hydrophobic fusion peptide inserts into the target membrane (Hernandez et al., 1996) . The native metastable state may also be triggered artificially by destabilizing agents such as heat or urea and by mutation (Ruigrok et al., 1986; Paterson et al., 2000; Wharton et al., 2000) . A transient prehairpin intermediate formed after insertion of the fusion peptide into the target membrane is susceptible to binding by peptides derived from the HRB regions of some vFGps. The HRB-derived peptides are thought to inhibit membrane fusion by preventing HRA and HRB from refolding into the fusogenic six-helix bundle (6HB) structure, which couples protein refolding directly to membrane fusion (Melikyan et al., 2000; Russell et al., 2001) . In this structure, a homotrimeric coiled coil formed by HRA is buttressed by three antiparallel COOH-terminal chains (in most cases consisting of residues from an HRB region) in an antiparallel fashion Eckert and Kim, 2001) .",

Influenza virus HA is the only type I vFGp for which the metastable structure is known at atomic resolution. The metastable structure of HA is stabilized by multiple interactions between regions of the protein that undergo a protein-refolding event associated with membrane fusion, such as the fusion peptide and HRA (Daniels et al., 1987; Bullough et al., 1994) . Although a high resolution structure for the native metastable form of HIV gp41 has not yet been obtained, mutational experiments have revealed that some HR residues that stabilize the gp41 6HB also affect the stability of the metastable gp120-gp41 complex (Follis et al., 2002; Sanders et al., 2002) .",

Most paramyxovirus F proteins require coexpression of their homotypic RBP for efficient fusion activity, and mutant RBPs have been discovered that retain receptor-binding activity, but have reduced or eliminated fusion-promotion activity (for review see Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001) . However, the SV5 W3A strain F protein mediates fusion when expressed alone, albeit to a lesser extent than when coexpressed with HN (Paterson et al., 1985) . The anomalous HN-independent fusion activity of SV5 W3A strain F has been mapped to P22 near the NH 2 terminus of F 2 (Ito et al., 2000; Paterson et al., 2000; Tsurudome et al., 2001) , and HN-independent fusion by NDV F results from an L289A mutation (Sergel et al., 2000) that is located on the NDV F atomic structure between the fusogenic and \u2424 -barrel domains (Chen et al., 2001; Fig. 1) . Moreover, the SV5 W3A strain F mutation S443P (in a region adjacent to HRB) has a hyperactive fusion phenotype (Paterson et al., 2000) . The mechanisms by which these mutations lower the energy required to activate metastable F and their effects on F protein intermediates and fusogenic F are unclear.",

As predicted by the continuation of the HRA coiled coil into the fusion peptide and the proximity of the HRB helices to the TM domain (Baker et al., 1999) , experiments on the arrest and capture of SV5 F intermediates are consistent with the formation of the 6HB being coupled directly to membrane merger (Russell et al., 2001) . The atomic structure of NDV F has been determined from a crystal consisting of a mixture of uncleaved F 0 and cleaved F (cleaved at residue 139 in the fusion peptide region instead of the biological cleavage site at 117; Chen et al., 2001) . Unfortunately, there is a lack of interpretable electron density for axial crystal contacts and for the fusion peptide, NH 2 -terminal half of HRA, and HRB regions. Therefore, the roles of the HR regions in the structural transitions of F during the fusion process remain unclear (Colman and Lawrence, 2003) .",

Mutation of the HRA cavity-binding residues destabilizes the 6HB structure and decreases the inhibitory potency of SV5 C-peptides in a correlative manner. These results identify in the F protein the physical target of the potent C-1 inhibitory peptide. Unexpectedly, the effects of the L447 and I449 mutations on F protein activation were even more drastic than their effects on 6HB formation. Residues 447 and 449 are shown here to be critical determinants of the energetic threshold required for activation of metastable F. In fact, mutant F proteins containing aromatic mutations at L447 and I449 cause hyperactive fusion despite having reduced 6HB stabilities, thus displaying a novel phenotype in which 6HB stability does not correlate with fusogenicity. Com-bined with previous data from this paper showing that residue 443 is also critical in the activation of F, the present data show that the residues comprising a linear segment adjacent to HRB (including [but not limited to] residues 443, 447, and 449) regulate the stabilization and controlled activation of metastable F. Overall, the data are consistent with this linear segment having dual interaction sites in F, one in metastable F and one in the 6HB, thereby providing a key regulation of the precise switch between the metastable and fusion-active forms of the protein. We propose that other type I vFGps like HIV gp41 may have evolved similar dualfunctional residues to control the precise switch between their native and fusogenic structures.",

To study the role of these residues in stabilizing the 6HB, we performed an experiment analogous to a study on HIV-1 gp41-derived peptides (Chan et al., 1998) . C-1 peptides containing mutations at L447 and I449 of varying hydrophobic bulk (Gly, Ala, Val, Ile/Leu, Phe, and Trp) were incubated with N-1. Similar to the wild-type (wt) 6HB complex, all of the mutant peptide complexes formed trimers of heterodimers with high \u2423 -helical content, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism ( Table I) . Analysis of the thermal melts of the 6HB complexes showed that the mutations resulted in 6HB stabilities with the following rank order: Gly \u03fd Ala \u03f7 Trp \u03f7 Phe \u03fd Val \u03fd Ile/Leu \u03fd wt (Table I; Fig. 2 , A and B). For the mutants containing aliphatic residues, 6HB stability correlated with hydrophobic bulk (Gly \u03fd Ala \u03fd Val \u03fd wt) and conservation of packing interactions (Ile/Leu \u03fd wt). The decrease in 6HB stability due to an increase in aromatic sidechain bulk is also consistent with the conservation of packing interactions stabilizing the 6HB. Together, the data indicate that specific hydrophobic contacts between L447 and I449 and N-1 stabilize the SV5 F 6HB. However, the C-peptide with the most destabilizing mutation studied here, I449G, still contributed to the formation of a 6HB with a T m of 79 \u040a C (only \u202b\u0641\u202c 20 \u040a C lower than the wt 6HB).",

The C-peptide IC 50 values correlate with their corresponding 6HB thermal stabilities (Fig. 2 F) . The apparent linear relationship between log IC 50 and T m indicates C-peptide inhibitory potency is directly related to C-peptide affinity for the N-1 core.

In contrast, the F protein of SV5 W3A strain mediates fusion in the absence of HN, albeit to a reduced extent when compared with HN coexpression (Paterson et al., 1985) . Although the amino acid sequences of the two strains differ at residues 22, 443, and 516, previous work has shown that proline residues at positions 22 and 443 enhance membrane fusion and contribute to HN-independent fusion (Ito et al., 2000; Paterson et al., 2000) . The WR and W3A strain F proteins have at position 22 the residues Leu and Pro, respectively, and have at position 443 the residues Pro and Ser, respectively. The conformation-specific mAb 21-1 is highly reactive to the fusion-hyperactive WR F mutant L22P, but shows little reactivity to the HN-dependent WR F unless WR F is heated to 47 \u040a C (Tsurudome et al., 2001) . Although the epitope for mAb 21-1 has been mapped to the NH 2 -terminal half of F 2 and the \u2424 -sheet domain in F1 (Tsurudome et al., 2001) , the fusion-hyperactive SV5 W3A F mutant S443P (residue 443 is not in the mAb 21-1 epitope) also has increased mAb 21-1 reactivity (Table II) . Thus, mAb 21-1 can be used as a sensitive probe for F protein conformational changes related to heightened fusion activation. Flow-cytometric analysis of mAb 21-1 reactivity to the W3A strain F mutants at L447 and I449 in the absence of HN coexpression showed that F proteins containing the aliphatic mutations maintain wt-like reactivity, whereas F proteins containing the aromatic mutations have increased reactivity (Table II) . The results are consistent with the following W3A F mutations resulting in partial triggering of F in the absence of HN coexpression or target binding: S443P, L447F, L447W, I449F, and I449W.",

Representative photomicrographs of syncytium formation in BHK cells transfected with the F mutants are shown in Fig.  3 A. All of the mutants except I449G (which has a cell surface expression level \u03fd 10% of wt) promoted syncytium formation when coexpressed with SV5 HN (Table III ). In the presence of HN coexpression, I449A and I449V promoted syncytium formation less efficiently than wt F, whereas the remainder of the F proteins containing aliphatic mutations promoted syncytium formation similar to wt F. When coexpressed with HN, the F proteins containing aromatic mutations promoted larger syncytium formation than wt F ( Fig.  3 A) . Therefore, the effects of the L447 and I449 mutations on syncytium formation do not correlate with their effects on 6HB stability. In the absence of HN coexpression, L447I and I449L were the only F proteins with aliphatic mutations that promoted syncytium formation, although to a reduced extent than wt F. In contrast, the F proteins with aromatic mutations promoted larger syncytium formation than wt in both the presence and absence of HN coexpression. The F proteins containing aromatic mutations appear to have a less stringent requirement for HN coexpression for F-mediated syncytium formation, whereas the F proteins containing aliphatic mutations are more dependent on HN coexpression. Again, the effects of the mutations on syncytium formation in the absence of HN coexpression do not correlate with their effects on 6HB stability.",

The fusion activity of wt F as a function of expression in the presence and absence of HN coexpression is reported in Fig. 3 (B and C, respectively).

            "text": "The L447 and I449 mutations in C-1 reduce 6HB stability (Table I ; Fig. 2 ), and the available data indicate that 6HB formation is coupled directly to membrane merger (Russell et al., 2001) . In principle, the reduction in fusion activity by the F proteins containing aliphatic mutations could be due to a decrease in energy released per 6HB given a fixed number of activated trimers. If this were the case, fusion might be arrested at either a hemifusion stage (characterized by the ability to promote lipid but not content mixing; Melikyan et al., 1999; Armstrong et al., 2000) or after formation of a target membrane-inserted prehairpin intermediate (characterized by the ability to retain bound RBCs independent of HN; Russell et al., 2001) . To test the effects of the mutations on late steps in fusion, we performed a dye transfer assay for fusion using dual-labeled (lipidic R18 and aqueous carboxyfluorescein [CF]) RBCs. There were no significant differences between the extents of transfer of R18 lipidic dye and CF aqueous dye for any individual mutant, whether coexpressed with SV5 HN or when coexpressed with uncleaved influenza virus HA (fusion inactive) as a binding protein (Table III) . Therefore, the mutants do not exhibit a hemifusion phenotype. Consistent with the results obtained from syncytia analysis and from the luciferase assay, the F proteins containing aliphatic mutations had a great reduction in dye transfer in the absence of HN coexpression. Unexpectedly, we found the F proteins containing aromatic mutations L447F and L447W did not promote dye transfer, and that I449F and I449W promoted dye transfer inefficiently. To address the apparent anomaly of these mutants having a fusion-hyperactive phenotype in syncytium formation and the luciferase assay, but a fusion-deficient phenotype in the dye transfer assay, we performed the dyetransfer assay using CF-labeled RBC target cells and SYTO-17-labeled CV-1 effector cells. With the modified assay, both syncytium formation by CV-1 effector cells and dye transfer from RBC target cells were visualized simultaneously. Moreover, the differential labeling of CV-1 cells and RBCs also allows for analysis of F-dependent retention of target RBCs resulting from a prehairpin conformation of the F protein that is likely anchored to both cell membranes through the TM and fusion peptide regions (Russell et al., 2001) . Incubation of the effector-target cell complexes at 37\u040aC resulted either in dye transfer or the release of unfused RBCs (due to a decrease in affinity of HN for its receptor sialic acid upon heating at 37\u040aC; Corey et al., 2003; Fig. 4 ). The lack of F-dependent RBC retention by mutants with inefficient dye transfer is consistent with the mutations affecting an F protein intermediate preceding prehairpin formation (Russell et al., 2001) , and not due to differential binding of RBCs because all of the mutant F proteins bound similar numbers of RBCs (unpublished data). Differential levels of syncytium formation occurred between CV-1 cells expressing HN and the F mutants before incubation of effector-target cell complexes at 37\u040aC (unpublished data), as can be seen in the images collected after 37\u040aC incubation (Fig. 4) . The large syncytia formed between cells coexpressing HN and the F proteins containing aromatic mutations (Fig. 4 , arrows) indicates these mutations cause the F pro- teins to exhibit a hyperactive fusion-promotion ability after reaching the cell surface, provided target cells are proximal. However, the lack of efficient dye transfer after 18 h incubation at 33\u040aC before target RBC coincubation for 1 h at 4\u040aC and 15 min incubation at 37\u040aC is completely consistent with these F proteins containing aromatic mutations becoming inactivated in the absence of fusion targets. It should be noted that for the luciferase assay, the transiently transfected Vero cells were incubated for 18 h at 37\u040aC before target T7-BSR cell coincubation for 8 h at 37\u040aC, so that the combination of a long coincubation time (8 h vs. 15 min) and continuous (further) expression of the F protein mutants did not reveal the \"do-or-die\" phenotype of the F proteins containing aromatic mutations that was observed in the RBC dye-transfer assay. Additionally, Vero cells were specifically chosen for the luciferase assay because Vero cells do not form syncytia after 18 h of transient transfection with the F protein mutants, whereas transiently transfected BHK cells and infected/transfected CV1 cells do form syncytia 18 h after transfection. The fusion-hyperactive S443P mutant did not become inactivated under the conditions of the RBC dye-transfer assay (Table III) , suggesting that the hyperactive fusion phenotype of the aromatic mutations at L447 and I449 differs from that of S443P, despite both S443P and the aromatic mutations at L447 and I449 having increased reactivity to mAb 21-1, increased syncytium formation, and increased luciferase activity.",

To test whether the L447 and I449 W3A strain F mutants had altered fusion efficiencies due to altered activation thresholds, we studied the temperature dependence of their dye-transfer efficiencies (Fig. 5 A) . Consistent with the F proteins containing aliphatic mutations having larger activation thresholds than wt F, these mutant F proteins caused increasing extents of fusion at increasing incubation temperatures. In contrast, the two F proteins containing aromatic mutations that caused a limited amount of dye transfer, I449F and I449W, reached their maximum (albeit low) fusion extents at or below 22\u040aC (Fig. 5 A) , promoted dye transfer at a slower initial rate than wt, and reached their final extents of fusion faster than wt (Fig. 5 B) . Thus, dye transfer by F proteins I449F and I449W either occurs rapidly without a high thermal requirement or not at all. In the RBC dye-transfer assays, although the F proteins containing aromatic mutations caused massive syncytium formation between CV1 cells (Fig. 4, arrows) , they caused little or no dye transfer, but when observed, it occurred at low temperature (Fig. 5 B) . Therefore, we hypothesized that the aromatic mutations were not only destabilizing the F protein upon surface expression (thereby enhancing syncytia formation), but were also inactivating the F protein rela-tively quickly (thereby diminishing dye transfer from RBC target cells coincubated with CV-1 effector cells hours after cell surface expression of the F mutants). To prevent the suspected inactivation of the F proteins containing aromatic mutations in the absence of CF-labeled RBC target cells, we introduced these mutations into the background of a mutant (FR3) that only contains three Arg residues in the F protein cleavage/activation site, and thus is not cleaved by furin, but can be cleaved by addition of exogenous trypsin (Ward et al., 1995) . Cleavage of the double mutants (FR3 mutants containing aromatic substitutions at 447 and 449) at 4\u040aC followed by coincubation with CF-labeled RBCs at 4\u040aC and a warm-up to 22 or 37\u040aC resulted in extremely effi-",

Averages and error bars are from statistical analyses of 3-5 microscopic fields. (A) Temperature dependence of fusion measured by CF dye transfer. Effector-target cell complexes were incubated at various temperatures for 5 min. No dye transfer was observed after incubation at any of the reported temperatures for no F DNA transfected or for the mutants L447F, L447W, and I449G. The F proteins containing the aliphatic mutations have increasing fusion extents as the incubation temperature is increased, whereas the F proteins containing the aromatic mutations I449F and I449W reach maximal fusion extents at a temperature as low as 22\u040aC. (B) Kinetics of CF dye transfer for wt and the aromatic mutants at L447 and I449. In the presence of HN coexpression, wt F reached a maximal fusion extent within 5 min and F I449F and F I449W reached a maximum within 2.5 min. Cotransfection of uncleaved influenza virus Udorn HA (fusion inactive) in addition to SV5 F and HN led to retention of target RBCs after 15 min, but did not lead to an increase in the extent of dye transfer (not depicted). cient dye transfer (Fig. 6) . In contrast, the pseudo wt FR3 mutant (with only the 2-residue deletion in the cleavage site) did not cause dye transfer after incubation at 22\u040aC, but instead required heating to 37\u040aC for efficient dye transfer. The data show that the F proteins with aromatic mutations at residues 447 and 449 are hyperactive for dye transfer when they are incorporated into the FR3 protein, and are thus prevented from premature inactivation in the absence of target cells.",

The importance of the HR regions in the paramyxovirus fusion mechanism is suggested by their conservation (Fig. 1) and their requirement for fusion activity (Buckland et al., 1992; McGinnes et al., 2001; Sergel et al., 2001) . Additionally, peptides derived from the HR regions of paramyxovirus F inhibit fusion (for review see Colman and Lawrence, 2003) , presumably by preventing 6HB formation, which appears to be coupled directly to membrane fusion (Russell et al., 2001) . Here, we define a relatively localized segment upstream of HRB (residues 443, 447, and 449) in the F polypeptide chain that provides a key regulatory switch between the native and fusogenic conformations of the F protein. First, residues 447 and 449 engage a hydrophobic pocket of the HRA coiled coil in the fusogenic 6HB conformation, with mutations of these residues affecting the overall stability of the final 6HB conformation. Second, the correlated patterns of 6HB stability and C-peptide inhibition of F-mediated fusion confirm that the HRA coiled coil is the physical target of the C-peptide in the intact F protein. Third, and most importantly, residues 443, 447, and 449 profoundly influence the activation barrier of the metastable, prefusion F conformation in a manner that is not anticipated from analysis of the 6HB structure (Fig. 7 B) . Therefore, residues 443, 447, and 449 must play two distinct structural and functional roles in the prefusion and 6HB conformations.",

The cone-shaped form most likely represents a prefusogenic F, whereas the lollipop-shaped form most likely represents fusogenic F with its 100-\u00c5 long rodlike stalk corresponding to a 6HB formed by the HR regions. The crystal structure of NDV F is thought to correspond to common structures shared by both the native and fusogenic forms of F (Chen et al., 2001) . However, the lack of interpretable electron density for the fusion peptide, HRB, and the NH 2 -terminal half of HRA suggests these regions adopt different structures in both forms. In the fusogenic or post-fusogenic structure, HRB and residues 447 and 449 bind in the grooves of the HRA coiled coil, forming a 6HB revealed in the structure of the SV5 core complex (Baker et al., 1999) . In the native prefusion structure, we suggest that the residues adjacent to HRB (SV5 F residues 443, 447, and 449) make alternative contacts within F because they are key regulators of the stabilization and activation of native F, even in the absence of HN. The binding of these and potentially other residues in HRB within the native structure may contribute to its cone-shaped morphology (in comparison with the lollipop-shaped morphology; Calder et al., 2000) . The data also suggest that the transition from the native to the fusogenic forms of F must include the formation of a prehairpin intermediate containing a triple-stranded HRA coiled coil, which is accessible for C-peptide binding, but not for HRB binding (Fig. 7 A) . Conserved packing interactions between the cavity-binding residues 447 and 449 and the HRA hydrophobic cavity are critical in stabilizing Figure 6 . The F proteins containing aromatic mutations cause efficient dye transfer. Cell-cell fusion measured by CF dye transfer from target RBCs to effector CV-1 cells coexpressing SV5 HN and FR3 (trypsin-inducible cleavage mutation of 5 Arg to 3 Arg residues at the cleavage site) proteins containing aromatic mutations at L447 and I449. CV-1 effector cells were incubated at 4\u040aC for 1 h either in the presence (\u03e9T) or absence (\u03eaT) of 10 g/ml TPCK-trypsin, subsequently coincubated with target RBCs at 4\u040aC for 1 h and then incubated at either 22 or 37\u040aC for 15 min. Trypsin-cleaved FR3 mutants with aromatic mutations at 447 and 449 efficiently cause CF dye transfer at both 22 and 37\u040aC, whereas the pseudo wt FR3 mutant (with only the 5 Arg to 3 Arg mutation at the cleavage site) does not cause dye transfer at 22\u040aC. Bar, 20 m. the 6HB structure. All of the mutations of cavity-binding residues studied here decrease 6HB stability. Moreover, the paramyxovirus F proteins generally compensate for nonidentical residues in the HRA cavity with complementary changes in HRB cavity-binding residues (Zhao et al., 2000) . The 6HB structures from filoviral, retroviral, and lentiviral vFGps such as Ebola virus GP2, HIV gp41, SIV gp41, MoMLV TM, HTVL-1 gp21, and Visna virus TM also reveal prominent hydrophobic HRA cavities that may be suitable drug targets (for review see Eckert and Kim, 2001) . The importance of the cavity-binding residues in both the native and fusogenic structures of paramyxovirus F suggests that the evolution of drug-resistant strains against such inhibitors would occur infrequently.",

The F proteins containing aromatic mutations form less stable 6HBs than wt F (Fig. 2) , thereby coupling less energy to fusion per 6HB. The hyperactive phenotype of the F proteins containing aromatic mutations is consistent with these mutations destabilizing the F protein native metastable state so that more trimers become activated (Fig. 7 B) . In contrast, it seems most likely that the F proteins containing aliphatic mutations have both higher energetic requirements for activation and lower amounts of energy per 6HB to couple to fusion (Fig. 7 B) . For the F proteins containing the aliphatic mutations, the decrease in fusion activity is most likely due to the combination of decreases in the number of activated trimers and the amount of energy released per 6HB. The fusion deficiencies of the aliphatic mutants cannot be due to their reduced 6HB stabilities alone because the aliphatic mutants were restricted at fusion activation and not at prehairpin or hemifusion intermediate formation.",

            "text": "To avoid inactivation, the native metastable structures of the type I vFGps must prevent indiscriminate release of the fusion peptide and HR regions until the target membranes are within range. A general strategy for a tightly regulated fusion mechanism may include sequences within or near HR regions having dual structural roles; one in the native structure to regulate fusion activation and another in the final structure to determine hairpin stability. The linear segment from 443 to 449, adjacent to HRB, in the paramyxovirus F protein has been shown here to be critical in stabilizing both the native and fusogenic forms of the protein. Moreover, mutational analyses on HIV gp41-mediated fusion have identified individual HRA and HRB residues critical in the stabilization of both the native gp120-gp41 complex and the 6HB structure (Lu et al., 2001; Follis et al., 2002; Sanders et al., 2002) . The strongest evidence for HR residues with dual, independent interaction sites comes from structural and genetic experiments on influenza virus HA. Numerous HRA residues in HA2 (in segments A and C) bind to other HRA residues in the native structure, but interact with the antiparallel buttressing strand (equivalent to a HRB region) in the Russell et al., 2001) ; the native structure (which is in a metastable conformation), a temperature-arrested intermediate (which forms after HN binds its receptor at nonfusion-permissive temperatures and is susceptible to N-1 binding), a prehairpin intermediate (which adheres to target cells independent of HN and is susceptible to C-1 binding), and the fusogenic form of F (which couples 6HB formation to membrane merger). The present work is consistent with residues 447 and 449 having distinct interaction sites on the F protein, one in the native structure, and the other in the cavity formed by HRA trimers in the 6HB of the fusogenic form. The strong correlation between 6HB stability and C-peptide inhibitory potency in the present work and the coincidence of C-1 inhibition and F protein binding in a previous work (Russell et al., 2001) show that C-1 inhibits membrane fusion by binding to transiently exposed HRA triple-stranded coiled coils in the prehairpin intermediate. (B) Biophysical experiments on the N-1/C-peptide mutants show that the aliphatic (al) and aromatic (ar) mutations at L447 and I449 decrease the amount of energy released by mutant 6HB formation, whereas functional experiments on the F mutants are consistent with the aromatic (ar) mutations decreasing and the aliphatic (al) mutations increasing the activation energy of the native state. The hyperactive fusion phenotype of the aromatic mutants is consistent with the facile activation (and subsequent inactivation in the absence of a fusion target) of these F mutants overcompensating for the decrease in energy released by mutant 6HB formation. fusogenic structure (Daniels et al., 1987; Bullough et al., 1994; Chen et al., 1999) . Other residues identified as critical in the switch between the native and fusogenic structures of HA2 include those in and around the fusion peptide and those involved in interactions between HA2 and HA1 (Bullough et al., 1994) , showing regions other than the HR regions may be critical in stabilizing the native states of other type I vFGps. Further structural and biochemical analyses on the native metastable forms of these proteins will be instrumental in better understanding the general principles governing type I fusion activation and its inhibition.",
