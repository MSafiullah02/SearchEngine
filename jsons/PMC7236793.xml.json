All chemical bonds related to hydrogen atoms are fixed using the SHAKE algorithm. The Standard Dynamics Cascade process includes five stages: minimization, minimization 2, heating, equilibration and production. Minimization and minimization 2 is minimized by the 2000-step steepest descent method and the 2000-step conjugate gradient method. The heating step is slowly heating up to 300 K. Next, the system performs the simulation of the balancing step under the ensemble of constant pressure normal pressure and temperature (NPT). Simulation time is set to 200 picosecond (ps) and so on, and 100 conformations are obtained in the production item. For the files generated by the molecular dynamics simulation, the trajectory analysis was carried out. In order to evaluate the structure of the simulation system, we performed the calculation of root mean square deviation.",

Five key proteins include open reading frame 1ab (orf1ab) in the nonstructural region and four structural proteins: S protein, E protein, M protein and N protein. The results show that the four main proteins of 2019-nCoV have the highest homology with that of bat SARS CoV RaTG13 and bat SARS CoV ZC45. E protein of 2019-nCoV has 100% homology with that of both bat SARS CoVs (Figure 1A), and the identity of orf1ab, M and N proteins between 2019-nCoV and bat SARS CoVs has also been reached at 94.27% or more (Figure 1B\u2013D). The comparison results of the S protein showed that it still has the highest homology with bat SARS CoV RaTG13 and bat SARS CoV ZC45 reached 97.71 and 81.85%, respectively (Figure 1E). Overall, 2019-nCoV is basically developed from bat SARS CoV, with the highest degree of homology to bat SARS CoV RaTG13, which is consistent with the results of existing studies [14], and the degree of agreement with other SARS CoVs is also greater than 75%, suggesting that we can use the homology modeling method to predict 2019-nCoV protein structure, which can be used for virtual screening, molecular docking and drug design [15,16] for accelerating the development of anti-2019-nCoV drugs.",

Among them, 3CL protease is the main protein processing enzyme of CoV, which is essential for virus replication and proliferation (Figure 2A) [18]. E protein is also a membrane integrin, consisting of a highly hydrophobic N-terminus (the transmembrane region of E protein) and a C-terminus that extends into the body of the virus (Figure 2B) [19]. The S protein is the main protein that interacts with host cells on the viral coat (Figure 2C).The protein produced by PLpro digestion is necessary for the virus, because it can activate the synthesis of viral mRNA (Figure 2D) [20]. We separately predicted the structure of these key proteins. Ramachandran plot and Profile-3D were used to evaluate the quality of the predicted structure (Supplementary Figure 1), and by using two different S protein templates, we predicted two different states conformation of the S protein during its interaction with ACE2. This is consistent with the research by Wrapp et al. [21]. At the same time, we conducted a molecular dynamics simulation, and the root mean square deviation trajectory of each conformation was basically stable, as shown in Figure 2A\u2013D. The structures of these proteins are common targets for drug development. Taking the PLpro structure obtained by homology modeling as a target, and using a peptide with low toxicity and favorable for clinical acceleration as an example [22], the full-sequence library of tripeptides was subjected to screening of antivitual drugs. Finally, the tripeptide with amino acid sequence Val-Val-Asn (TP8) with strong binding ability to ACE2 was obtained. The results show that TP8 can contact and form hydrogen bonds with the catalytic sites His272 and Asp286 of the PLpro (Figure 2E).",

Because the insertion sites are not in the nsp3d region that contain PLpro (Figure 3A), the inserted sequence has little effect on the structure and function of PLpro. However, the two transmembrane domains contained in nsp3 are localized on nsp3b and nsp3c [24]. It may affect the localization of the nsp3 protein on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane [25]. The results of S protein sequence comparison showed the largest differences among all proteins. In the RBD site [26], three of the six key amino acid residues that interact with ACE2 have been changed. Pro470, Tyr484 and Thr487 are converted to Glu, Gln and Asn, respectively (Figure 3B). It is worth mentioning that the 470th amino acid was changed from nonpolar to polar amino acid. By analyzing the surface properties of the RBD structure of 2019-nCoV and bat SARS CoV (PDB ID: 6acc), we found that the RBD region polarity of the 2019-nCoV was more dense than the bat SARS CoV after mutation (Figure 3C). At the same time, four insert boxes (IBs; 1\u20134) were inserted into the N-terminus and S2 region of S protein in 2019-nCoV (Figure 3B). We selected the 2019-nCoV S protein with a low degree of homology comparison and compared it with the S protein of bat SARS CoV [27]. It was found that the insertion of IB3 increased the lateral expansion area of the S1 portion of the 2019-nCoV S protein, and a loop structure is extended at the overlap with the bat SARS CoV. The insertion of IB4 also adds a loop structure to the envelope region of S2 (Figure 3D), and the loop structure of proteins is often closely related to the structure and function of proteins [28,29].",

Then new, predicted structure is used to analyze the interaction between RBD and ACE2. We found that based on the original hydrogen bond, Arg170 of ACE2 and Thr486 of RBD added a new hydrogen bond. Gln81 of ACE2 forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr484 while forming hydrogen bonds with Tyr435 of RBD (Figure 4A & B). It is suggested that the mutation of three amino acid residues in RBD may weaken the 2019-nCoV interaction with ACE2. At the same time, we found that compared with ordinary bat SARS CoV, the four in the five prolines (Pro458, Pro461, Pro465, Pro468 and Pro470) of 2019-nCoV RBD were replaced with other amino acids (Figure 3B), so we changed the four amino acid residues to the original proline. The interaction between RBD and ACE2 was also analyzed to study the impact of this change on 2019-nCoV, but the results showed that the replacement of prolines has little effect on the interaction between 2019-nCoV and ACE2 (Figure 4A & C).",

            "text": "Through homology alignment, we elaborated the sequence differences of each key protein between 2019-nCoV and other bat SARS CoVs, and analyzed whether the new sequence changes in 2019-nCoV affected the function of each key protein. It was found that the sequence and protein structure of the structural proteins E, M and N of 2019-nCoV are basically consistent with that of bat SARS CoV. Considering that the structure determines the function, we believe that these three proteins should not be mutated. Although the orf1ab region has two large changes in the sequence, these changed positions are in nsp3b and nsp3c, not in the PLpro and 3CL hydrolase regions. Therefore, it has little effect on the two proteins that play a key role in the virus replication process. At the same time, we give examples of its application in the screening of peptide drugs after predicting the structure of PLpro. Among all proteins, the S protein has the largest variation, and most of the changes are located in the S1 region that interacts with ACE2. We also predicted two possible conformational changes of the S protein. They are similar to the changes of bat SARS CoV in the process of binding with ACE2, which suggests that the interaction mechanism between 2019-nCoV and ACE2 may be the same as bat SARS CoV. Based on the amino acid sequence and protein structure alignment, we found that the periphery of the S1 region is more extended than the general bat SARS CoVs. As the most direct structure with the outside world, this may eventually affect its binding to the receptor or its adsorption to objects. The three amino acids that interact with ACE2 are altered in the RBD of 2019-nCoV. By analyzing the surface properties of the protein, it was found that this change made the region more polar. In order to further study the effect of changed amino acids on the RBD, we back mutated these three amino acids and found that the mutated RBD structure has a stronger effect on ACE2. Because the RBD is more polar, and the number of hydrogen bonds it interacts with ACE2 is reduced, the strength of 2019-nCoV binding to ACE2 may be similar to common bat SARS CoV.",

The new fragment inserted in orf1ab has no effect on PLpro and 3CL hydrolase. Our predicted protein structure is highly reliable and can be used for drug development. We took the low-toxicity peptide library as an example, and successfully screened a tripeptide for potential drugs. For S proteins with large sequence differences, changes of key amino acid residues in RBD reduce the number of hydrogen bonds binding to ACE2. However, due to the extension of the loop structure in S1 and the increase of polarity, this may make the binding ability of 2019-nCoV and ACE2 similar to that of bat SARS CoV.",

CoV is an ssRNA structure, based on its instability, multiple virus mutations have been found in the past few years. However, because the experimental structure analysis of viral proteins requires time, it is difficult to meet the urgent need for drug development in emergencies. Although the virus mutates, it has a high degree of homology with the original bat SARS CoVs. The structure obtained by homology modeling has the potential to replace the crystal structure, and this will help to speed up drug development and facilitate structural and functional analysis of mutant viral proteins. It will play an important role in the future fight against different mutant viruses.",
