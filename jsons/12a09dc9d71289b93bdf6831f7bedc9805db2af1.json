In the United States there are currently over one million documented cases and more than 88,000 deaths [1, 2] . As there are no approved treatments, management of COVID-19 is largely supportive [3, 4] . 4 One empirical treatment for COVID-19 which has received attention is hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug repurposed in recognition of its anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of autoimmune conditions. Hydroxychloroquine and its analogue, chloroquine, demonstrate suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, with hydroxychloroquine demonstrating greater potency [5, 6] . Studies from the original SARS-CoV virus suggest a mechanism of action involving impairment of the terminal glycosation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), inhibition of SARS-CoV viral entry, and rapid elevation of endosomal pH that prevents endosome-mediated viral entry [7] [8] [9] [10] . The immunomodulatory effects are thought to be due to the accumulation of the drug in lymphocytes and macrophages leading to reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, including type I interferons, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-6 [9] . Other anti-inflammatory effects may be related to inhibition of signaling pathways [11] .",

This cytokine storm results in a pro-thrombotic milieu, cardiomyopathy, and ultimately multi-organ failure [16, 17] . Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against membrane bound IL-6 receptor inhibiting binding of soluble IL-6 and subsequent signal transduction, has been proposed as a therapeutic candidate for impeding cytokine storm [18] . Small single institution series have suggested benefit among severely ill patients [19, 20] . Preliminary results from a press release for the French CORIMUNO-TOCI trial (NCT04331808), an open-label randomized trial of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 129), noted a reduction in the proportion of participants who died or needed ventilation in the tocilizumab group, although full results of the trial have not yet been released [21] .",

Furthermore, none of the reported observational studies have addressed the role of hydroxychloroquine among individuals with minimally symptomatic disease in the pre-hospital setting. Unlike randomized controlled trials, observational studies have inherent biases in patient allocations that cannot be fully adjusted for during statistical analyses. Although we utilized propensity modeling to mitigate known imbalances it is possible that unmeasured confounding factors may still be important. For example, in our series we observed a change in the prescribing patterns of hydroxychloroquine during the study timeframe. Similarly dosing and timing of hydroxychloroquine varied throughout the 13-hospital network. These factors (dosing, schedules, and changes in treatment patterns over time) are difficult to quantify in large observational studies. Nonetheless, our primary analysis is concordant with the other recent observational studies.",
