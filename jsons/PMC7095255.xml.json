Synthesis tools borrowed from the medical sciences, such as meta-analysis, have emerged as a powerful means to assess the rapidly growing literature in ecology and evolution. However, this rapidity may itself create problems if the results of syntheses quickly become outdated as new data refine the evidence base1.",

Among the tools they propose for this is cumulative meta-analysis: a means by which study effect sizes extracted from a literature search are aggregated and ordered by time, so that when they stabilize, it becomes clear that further new evidence would not alter the main conclusion. By routinely applying such tools prior to study commencement, they hope to reduce the accumulation of redundant information, so that efforts can be concentrated on higher-priority questions. One example the authors explore is an applied question \u2014 can acoustic recorders replace human observers for estimating bird abundance? \u2014 but identifying shifts in evidence are just as applicable to more fundamental questions. Indeed, a recent re-appraisal of the literature investigating whether male house sparrows use their black chest bibs as a signal of social status found very little support for this widely known example in behavioural ecology2.",

A lack of negative results in the published literature (the \u2018file drawer effect\u2019), may potentially alter the magnitude or even direction of a reported effect. Taxonomic and geographic biases that are widespread in the ecological literature are also likely to influence syntheses3, and even the effect of highly influential research networks may skew the type of research questions being asked4. Research published in non-English languages or in the grey literature also presents a potentially huge source of overlooked information5 and may often be excluded from search strategies.",

One possible solution that has been used as a gold standard in the medical sciences (such as the Cochrane Reviews) is to scrutinize systematic review protocols prior to data being extracted from the literature. Although it is possible to publish such study protocols for environmental meta-analysis (for example, the Environmental Evidence journal), it is not clear how widespread this practice is, but there may certainly be an argument for incentivizing more widespread adoption as a gold standard in ecology and evolution too7. Publication of Systematic Review protocols may also bring the added benefit of potentially reducing reviewing burden on the current pool of synthesis experts, as study methodologies may only need reviewing once, with any biological interpretation evaluated by subject-specific experts.",

For example, at Nature Ecology & Evolution, every relevant article must be accompanied by one of these specific checklists, in addition to our own Reporting Summary checklist.

For example, when whole disciplines become integrated in this way, evidence gaps may become clearer, but the boundaries between independent assessments and conflicts of interest may become blurred. Open projects like this will provide opportunities to close the gap with underrepresented groups, but this will also require that appropriate mechanisms are established for apportioning credit fairly among many collaborators, and training to ensure that all members of the community are able to critically appraise the synthesis methodology of the projects in which they are embedded.",

As the current global COVID-19 pandemic continues, it seems likely that mining literature and open datasets will be a viable alternative to the field campaigns and lab work that have been disrupted now that a large proportion of the research community is confined to their homes. Whatever direction research workflows evolve in the future, what is clear is that these tools are likely to continue to play a major role, and that the whole discipline will benefit from a fuller understanding and appreciation of their methods.",
