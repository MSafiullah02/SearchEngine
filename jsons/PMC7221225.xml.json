With workers required to stand shoulder to shoulder on the slaughter line, it\u2019s no surprise. In South Dakota, as reported in mid-April, at least 40% of infections had occurred at a single Smithfield Foods slaughter plant (Dickerson and Jordan 2020). As the number of infected workers soared and caused staff shortages, the Smithfield plant and many others closed or dramatically slowed production (Corkery and Yaffe-Bellany 2020). While sensible, this initiated a cascade of consequences throughout the industry supply chain, including the planned on-farm killing of millions of animals who had been scheduled for slaughter (Lauria 2020).",

Most disturbingly, it is responsible for deadly swine flu (CDC 2009) and bird flu (CDC 2015) pandemics of the past. The human death rate for H5N1, a strain of bird flu, surpasses that of COVID-19 (CDC 2015). Almost certainly, it will cause pandemics of the future, unless we act now. As one scientist warns, factory farms are \u201cthe most likely epicenter of the next pandemic\u201d (Hollenbeck 2016). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations even stated that \u201clivestock health is the weakest link in our global health chain\u201d (FAO 2013).",

Several of the largest meat companies already offer plant-based protein as well as \u201cblended\u201d protein (part animal meat, part plant). From Tyson to Perdue to Cargill, Big Meat knows that homogeneous production is risky. Demand for animal meat grows about 2% each year, but sales of plant-based meat and other direct replacements for animal products jumped 11% in 2019 (Gaan 2020). Governments can encourage this plant-based push by providing grants to scientists studying alternative protein production rather than funding cruel experiments for the meat industry (Moss 2015).",
