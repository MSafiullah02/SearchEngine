The continuing evolution of the virus is the cause of seasonal epidemics and, from time to time, of pandemics in the human population. Furthermore, due to appearance of influenza-like illnesses, diagnosis of this disease on the basis of clinical symptoms is possible only during the outbreak. It should be noted that in case of respiratory infections various clinical symptoms can be caused by the same virus and, on the other hand, the same set of symptoms can be caused by more than 200 different viruses (e.g. parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus). For this reason, the laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection is crucial in the influenza surveillance and is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Laboratory diagnosis of influenza includes confirmation of the presence of influenza virus antigen in the material collected from the patient and serological evidence of infection with influenza virus by detecting the increase of specific antibodies in patient's serum (Brydak 2008) . The major line of defense from influenza infection are antibodies directed against two glycoproteins exposed on the surface of the virion -hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (Johansson et al. 1989) . Furthermore, evolution of influenza virus is most evident in the case of these surface proteins. HA and NA antigens are constantly changing due to antigenic pressure. They both are highly immunogenic, and antibodies produced in response to viral infection are specific for a particular subtype of hemagglutinin (H1-H18) and neuraminidase (N1-N11) and do not give complete protection against all influenza virus strains (Nicholson et al. 1998) . The presence of hemagglutinin antibodies (anti-HA) provides not only protection against infection with specific strains of influenza virus, but also might alleviate symptoms of the disease in case of infection with another variant of the virus. This is caused by the occurrence of so-called cross-reactive antibodies. It has been shown that subtypespecific anti-HA antibodies can decrease the infectivity of the virus of other subtype by disruption of proliferation and release of viral particles during infection (Ekiert et al. 2011; Epstein and Price 2010; Thorsby et al. 2008) . For this reason, regular vaccinations are essential for reducing the impact of seasonal influenza and influenza prevention. Seasonal vaccinations protect from infection with currently circulating viruses and give cross-protection, which can reduce viral replication, accelerate viral clearance, and thus reduce the severity of disease. The World Health Organization leads the global influenza surveillance and gives seasonal recommendations for influenza virus strains included in the vaccine for the upcoming epidemic season.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1134, "end": 1147, "text": "(Brydak 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1354, "text": "(Johansson et al. 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1799, "text": "(Nicholson et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2336, "text": "(Ekiert et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2360, "text": "Epstein and Price 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2361, "end": 2381, "text": "Thorsby et al. 2008)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "An anti-HA antibody titers of 1:40 has been determined as corresponding to a 50 % reduction in the risk of contracting influenza in population (Hobson et al. 1972) and it is assumed that high titers of anti-HA antibodies (!1:40) provide protection against influenza infection. Furthermore, this value of titer, after vaccination, is required by European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for assessment of vaccines (Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products 1997). On the other hand, the anti-NA antibodies, even at high titers, only support the resistance because they do not prevent influenza infection themselves.

There are two types of influenza vaccines, which are currently available in Poland: inactivated split virion and subunit.

The highest level of protection rate was observed for the hemagglutinin H1 of A/California/7/2009pdm09 strain in the age group 4-7 (53.33 %). An analysis of the protection rate with respect to the age group, including all three types of hemagglutinin, revealed that in the 0-3 years old group the level of protection exhibited similar values: 16.00 % (B), 20.67 % (H3), and 26.67 % (H1) without the domination of particular hemagglutinin type.

The comparison of protection rates for hemagglutinin H1 of A/California/7/2009pdm09 strain is especially interesting. This type of A influenza virus has been circulating in the population since 2009. In the age groups of 4-7, 26-44, 45-64, and !65 years there has been a significant increase in the protection rate compared to the previous two seasons. In the youngest age group this value is higher in comparison to the last season, but lower than in the 2011/ 2012 season. However, in groups of 8-14 and 15-25 years old the protection rates remain at a similar level in all analyzed seasons. In the case Despite the apparent increase of protection rate in some age groups, this value did not achieve 60 %. These results are truly alarming as it shows that the value of protection rate against influenza in the Polish population is very low. The complications of influenza may be hazardous to health and life-threatening to persons who are not vaccinated, especially in the very young, the elderly, and those with other serious medical conditions. Influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection, but this fact is ignored by many people. It can be concluded, on the basis of serological screening of sera from people at different age groups in the epidemic season 2013/2014, that: 1. our results confirm the circulation of three antigenically different influenza strains: two subtypes of influenza A virus -A/California/ 7/2009(H1N1)pdm09 and A/Victoria/361/ 2011(H3N2) -and type B, B/Massachusetts/ 2/2012; 2. protection rate did not exceed 60 % in any age group, which demonstrates that the proportion of people vaccinated against influenza in Poland is very low.
