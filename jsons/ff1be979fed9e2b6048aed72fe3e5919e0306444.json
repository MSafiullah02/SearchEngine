A noncanonical, four-stranded structure formed in guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences, G-quadruplexes can readily form under physiologically relevant conditions and are globularly folded structures. DNA is widely recognized as a double-helical structure essential in genetic information storage. However, only~3% of the human genome is expressed in protein; RNA and DNA may form noncanonical secondary structures that are functionally important. G-quadruplexes are one such example which have gained considerable attention for their formation and regulatory roles in biologically significant regions, such as human telomeres, oncogene-promoter regions, replication initiation sites, and 5 0 -and 3 0 -untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA. They are shown to be a regulatory motif in a number of critical cellular processes including gene transcription, translation, replication, and genomic stability. G-quadruplexes are also found in nonhuman genomes, particularly those of human pathogens. Therefore, G-quadruplexes have emerged as a new class of molecular targets for drug development. In addition, there is considerable interest in the use of G-quadruplexes for biomaterials, biosensors, and biocatalysts. The First International Meeting on Quadruplex DNA was held in 2007, and the G-quadruplex field has been growing dramatically over the last decade. The methods used to study G-quadruplexes have been essential to the rapid progress in our understanding of this exciting nucleic acid secondary structure.",

            "text": "The first biologically relevant G-quadruplex was observed in telomeric DNA. Telomeres are specific DNA-protein complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes, providing protection against gene erosion from cell divisions, chromosomal nonhomologous end-joinings, and nuclease attacks [19] [20] [21] . Telomeric G-quadruplexes were first reported as novel intramolecular structures containing guanine-guanine base-pairs in single-stranded telomeric sequences of several organisms [22] , and as guaninetetrads between hairpin loops of the Tetrahymena telomeric DNA [23] . The importance of monovalent cations in the stabilization of G-quadruplex structures was revealed by Williamson, Cech in their monovalent cation-induced square-planar G-quartet model using the Oxytricha and Tetrahymena telomeric DNA [14] . Human telomeres consist of tandem repeats of the hexanucleotide d (TTAGGG) n 5-10 kb in length, which terminate in a singlestranded 3 0 -overhang of 35-600 bases [24] . Telomeres of cancer cells do not shorten upon replication, mainly due to the activation of a reverse transcriptase, telomerase, that extends the telomeric sequence at the chromosome ends [25] . Telomerase is activated in 80-85% of human cancer cells to maintain telomere length and malignant phenotype [25] [26] [27] . The G-quadruplex formation can inhibit the activity of telomerase [28] , making it an attractive target for cancer therapeutic intervention. In addition to the formation at the telomere end, which most likely involves intramolecular G-quadruplex structures, intermolecular G-quadruplex formation may also be involved in the T-loop invasion complex [29, 30] . Recently, telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) G-quadruplex was identified and found to inhibit telomerase [31, 32] .",

The first experiments that suggested the existence of unusual forms of DNA associated with runs of guanines in gene promoters were reported in 1982 for the chicken \u03b2-globulin gene based upon the nuclease hypersensitivity of promoter elements [55] [56] [57] . Since then, the occurrence of these elements in the human gene promoters has been reported, including in those of insulin . The potential occurrence of DNA G-quadruplexes has been discovered in the promoter regions of human genes involved in growth and proliferation [53, 78, 79] ; these genes all contain G-rich/C-rich tracts in the proximal regions of promoters and are mostly TATAless. In addition, the potential for quadruplex formation is higher within oncogenes as compared to tumor suppressor genes [80] . Computational analyses showed significant enrichment of G-quadruplex-forming sequences in the promoter regions of human genes near transcription start sites (TSS) [81] . The driving force of the formation of promoter G-quadruplexes appears to be the transcription-induced dynamic negative superhelicity [82] [83] [84] [85] . The c-MYC gene promoter is the most extensively studied system for the promoter G-quadruplex [54, 86] . A highly conserved G-rich nuclease hypersensitivity element III 1 in the proximal region of the c-MYC promoter controls 80-90% of the transcriptional activity regardless of whether the P1 or P2 promoter is used [87] [88] [89] [90] . This element in the c-MYC promoter is highly dynamic in its conformation [91] , and can form G-quadruplex structures, which function as a transcriptional silencer [54, 59] .",

The promoter G-rich sequences often contain more than four G-tracts with unequal numbers of guanines and can form multiple G-quadruplexes through utilizing varying combinations of G-tracts or different loop isomers through utilizing varying guanines on one G-tract [18] . Parallel structures are common to the promoter G-quadruplexes, usually with a three-tetrad core. Structural studies showed that each promoter G-quadruplex adopts . A notable feature in the promoter G-quadruplexes is the prevalence of the G 3 NG 3 motif, a robust parallel-stranded structural motif with a 1-nt propeller loop. This motif was first observed in the major G-quadruplex structure formed in the c-MYC promoter, which showed that the 1-nt propeller loop conformation is highly favored [ [109] [110] [111] . The variations in promoter G-quadruplexes give rise to different overall structure properties that could be specifically recognized by proteins or small-molecule ligands for transcriptional regulation. Moreover, inherent polymorphism and equilibrium between different conformations may provide an additional layer of transcriptional modulation.",

Many examples of G-quadruplexes were identified in viruses [145, 146] , including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [147] [148] [149] [150] , multiple species of herpes virus [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] , human papillomavirus (HPV) [156] , hepatitis C [157] , Zika [158] , Ebola [159] , and a G-quadruplexbinding protein was found in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [160] . In bacteria, G-quadruplexes are found in Escherichia coli [161] , Neisseria gonorrhoeae [162] , Neisseria meningitidis [163] , Mycobacterium tuberculosis [164] , and Deinococcus radiodurans [165] . G-quadruplexes were also found in ciliates [14], malaria parasites [166, 167] , and yeasts [168, 169] . Notably, helicases that resolve G-quadruplex structures, such as RecQ [170, 171] and Pif1 [142] families, were found in both nonhuman and human systems. Most recently, the presence of G-quadruplexes in plant genomes has also emerged [172] .",

            "text": "There has been significant progress in the detection of G-quadruplexes structures in vivo [173] . The first direct evidence of the in vivo existence of G-quadruplexes was established by using G-quadruplex-specific single chain variable fragment (scFv) of an antibody to detect G-quadruplexes formed at telomeres in macronuclei of the ciliate Stylonychia lemnae, which was shown to be cell cycle-dependent [174] and controlled by telomere end-binding proteins TEBP\u03b1 and TEBP\u03b2 phosphorylation [175] . More recently, using a G-quadruplex-specific antibodies BG4 (scFv) [176] and 1H6 (monoclonal antibody) [177] , G-quadruplex structures were visualized in human cells at both telomeric and non-telomeric sites on chromosomes, and G4-loci number increased after exposure of live cells to G-quadruplex ligands [176] or in the absence of FANCJ, a G-quadruplex DNA-specific helicase [177] . Using BG4 to map endogenous G-quadruplex structures by G4 ChIP-seq in human cells,~10,000 endogenous G-quadruplex structures were detected in immortalized precancerous HaCaT cells, 10 times higher than in normal human NHEK cells [178] . G-quadruplex structures were found to be enriched in nucleosome-depleted regulatory regions including the promoters, such as c-MYC, and 5 0 UTRs, of highly transcribed genes. The detected G-quadruplexes in cells account for less than 1% of the genomic G4-sites identified by G4-seq [179] or predicted by G4 algorithms [81] , suggesting the in vivo formation of G-quadruplex is highly context-dependent. In addition, the endogenous potential G4 sites were detected in live human cells by chemical footprinting combined with high-throughput sequencing and were found to enrich in regions involving chromatin reorganization and gene transcription [180] . G-quadruplex formation in vivo was also detected by small molecules probes, such as the radiolabeled Gquadruplex-ligands 360A [181] , and fluorescent G-quadruplexligands BMVC [182, 183] and DAOTA-M2 [184] .",

            "text": "Recognition of the biological significance of G-quadruplexes has promoted research and development of G-quadruplex-interactive small molecule ligands (G4-ligands). The identification of genomic G-quadruplex structures in regions of functional importance, such as human telomeres and oncogene promoters, has created the opportunity to selectively target these globular DNA structures for cancer-specific drug development [17, [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] . The therapeutic possibilities of targeting telomeric G-quadruplexes to inhibit telomerase were first reported in 1997 [191] and have been actively pursued [185] [186] [187] [188] . G-quadruplex-ligands were also shown to inhibit the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway which maintains telomere stability in a telomerase-independent manner in~15% of cancer cells [192] [193] [194] [195] . The discovery of the perylene derivative PIPER to inhibit helicase Sgs1-mediated G-quadruplex unfolding suggested the existence of a broader mechanism for G-quadruplex-ligands [196] . In 2002, a small molecule that stabilizes the G-quadruplex formed in the c-MYC promoter was shown to inhibit c-MYC expression, suggesting therapeutic opportunity of targeting promoter G-quadruplexes for transcriptional modulation [54, 197] . Different groups of compounds, such as quindolines and ellipticines, were reported to suppress c-MYC transcription by stabilization of the c-MYC promoter G-quadruplex [198] [199] [200] [201] . Subsequently, transcriptional repression of other oncogenes was shown by compounds stabilizing promoter G-quadruplexes, such as c-KIT [202] , BCL-2 [203] , KRAS [204] [205] [206] . More recently, G-quadruplex-stabilizing compounds were shown to cause DNA damage and genomic instability and exhibit synergistic effect with inhibitors or deficiency of DNA-repair mechanisms [207] [208] [209] [210] [211] . Specifically, G-quadruplexstabilizing compounds were shown to induce selective lethality in BRCA-deficient cancers by targeting the inherent DNA doublestrand break (DSB) repair deficiency [212, 213] .",

            "text": "A G-quadruplex targeting drug, Quarfloxin (CX-3543) [115] , based on the fluoroquinolone compounds developed by Laurence Hurley [214, 215] showed excellent in vivo activity in various solid tumors and had reached Phase II clinical trials. Its secondgeneration compound, CX-5461, is currently in clinical trials for BRCA1/2 deficient tumors (Canadian trial, NCT02719977) [213] . Diverse families of other small molecule compounds that interact with G-quadruplexes were developed and studied. For example, TMPyP4, a tetra-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphyrin, is a structure-based designed compound that exhibits significant selectivity for quadruplex DNA over duplex DNA and inhibits telomerase and ALT [216, 217] . Its positional isomer TMPyP2 is a poor G-quadruplex-interactive compound and can be used as a negative control of TMPyP4 [218] . Later studies revealed that TMPyP4 interacts with the c-MYC promoter G-quadruplex and downregulates c-MYC [54, 197] . TMPyP4 and TMPyP2 have been one of the most widely used molecules in G-quadruplex research. Telomestatin is a natural product isolated from Streptomyces anulatus 3533-SV4 to be a highly potent inhibitor of telomerase [219] and active against human cancers by stabilizing telomeric G-quadruplex and inhibit telomere-protein binding [220] [221] [222] [223] . BRACO19 is a rationally designed trisubstituted acridine to directly target telomeric G-quadruplex [224] and was shown to inhibit telomerase and induce telomere uncapping in human cancer cells [195] and have high in vivo activity against different cancer xenograft models [225, 226] . 12459 is a triazine G4-ligand that exhibits anti-telomerase activity but also appears to involve BCL-2 and hTERT splicing [192, 227, 228] . Closely related pyridine dicarboxamide derivatives 360A/307A and bisquinolinium compounds Phen-DC(3)/Phen-DC(6) are highly selective G-quadruplex ligands and were shown to be active against both telomeric and c-MYC G-quadruplex and inhibit c-MYC gene transcription in tumor cells, as well as bind to a G-quadruplex formed in the 5 0 -UTR of TRF2 mRNA to repress translation [133, [229] [230] [231] [232] . Phen-DC was also shown to trigger genetic instability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [207] . PDS is a pyridostatin compound which shows potent G-quadruplex-stabilization and has been widely used to study G-quadruplex functions and G-quadruplex-induced DNA damage [176, [210] [211] [212] 233] . In addition, G-quadruplex DNA was also shown to be potential cancer therapeutics. AS1411 (Antisoma, London, UK) is an unmodified 26-nt G-quadruplex forming oligonucleotide that has been in Phase II trials for treatment of renal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia [234] .",

            "text": "G-quadruplex-interactive compounds have contributed immensely to understanding G-quadruplex functions and potential as a therapeutic target. Different G-quadruplex-ligands show various levels of selectivity, between G-quadruplex structures over other forms of DNA and between different G-quadruplexes, and this selectivity is likely to be related to their biological activity. Conventional and in silico screening methods as well as structure-based rational drug design were actively pursued in the development of G-quadruplex-targeting small molecules. A common feature among the G-quadruplex-ligands is the presence of a fused ring system that is capable of stacking with the terminal G-tetrads. In addition, a crescent-shaped asymmetric pharmacophore that can recruit a DNA base and cationic side chain substituents that have the propensity to interact with G-quadruplex grooves can give rise to specific interactions (Fig. 1d) [235, 236] . Structural data of G-quadruplex-ligand complexes has been playing an important role in the understanding of small molecule recognition of G-quadruplexes and the design of G-quadruplex-ligands [18, 237] . This includes a handful NMR solution structures of intramolecular G-quadruplex-ligand complexes, including c-MYC G-quadruplex-ligand complexes [235, [238] [239] [240] and telomeric G-quadruplex-ligand complexes [236, [241] [242] [243] , and X-ray crystallographic structures of intramolecular and intermolecular telomeric G-quadruplex-ligand complexes [43, 237, [244] [245] [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] .",

The hybrid-type structures can effectively form packed multimers at the telomere ends [33, 45]. Although different human telomeric G-quadruplexes appear to have small energy differences relative to each other, interconversion between them is kinetically slow, indicating a high-energy intermediate (s) [33, 41, 46-48]. The structure polymorphism appears to be an intrinsic property of the highly conserved telomeric sequence in higher eukaryotes, particularly the TTA loop sequence [49]. On the other hand, telomeric repeat-containing RNA was shown to adopt parallel-stranded G-quadruplexes [50-52].",
