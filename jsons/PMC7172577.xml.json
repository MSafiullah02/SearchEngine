Ambulance sirens echo,\nday and night, through largely empty streets. Hospitals are overwhelmed with the\ncrushing load of COVID-19 cases and are suffering from shortages of personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) for care providers. More than 21 000 Americans\nhave died of COVID-19 in the past month, with more than 6000 of them in New York\nCity. Since mid-March, either by choice or in response to shelter-in-place orders,\nmost Americans have been staying home and limiting non-essential travel and\nindustrial and business activity has slowed to a crawl.",

Conscientious city dwellers now\nponder how to maintain safe social distance while sharing limited outdoor space\nwith others. Official recommendations in the United States have converged on 6 ft\nof distance as the rule of thumb1 for avoiding the exchange of\npotentially infective respiratory droplets and aerosols, but these recommendations\nwere devised on the basis of observations made in the 1930s for hospital\nenvironments.2 Do they hold for outdoors, in a breeze?\nDuring exercise?",

Household electricity use has increased dramatically, and\nconsumption patterns have shifted as a result of our new, more intensely domestic\nlifestyle. These changes in emissions coincide with the seasonal meteorological\nchanges that come with the transition from winter into spring, complicating the\nidentification and interpretation of trends from satellite data and long-term\nmonitoring networks. While air quality in New York City is similar to previous\nyears, Los Angeles residents are luxuriating in the unusually clear skies that the\ncombination of rainy weather and reduced vehicle traffic has provided.3 Dramatic improvements in visibility have been reported in some\nareas of India, while in others, agricultural burning and the use of solid fuels\nfor household cooking have kept levels of fine particulate matter high, despite\nshutdowns.4 Long-term exposure to air pollution is\nassociated with many of the medical conditions that put individuals at high risk\nfor complications related to COVID-19, including respiratory and cardiovascular\nconditions and diabetes. Analysis of data from Italy5 and the\nUnited States6 has begun to reveal a connection between\nparticulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5)\nexposure and COVID-19 deaths.",

The atmospheric aerosol community has lent\ntheir expertise and laboratory equipment to the testing of materials for homemade\nmasks for their ability to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets or\ninhalation of infective aerosols.8 Others have been involved in\ntesting the performance of N95 respirator masks after sterilization for reuse, or\nthe small-scale manufacture of PPE, such as face shields. Aerosol scientists have\nalso weighed in to the public discussion about respiratory aerosols and the\nairborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 indoors and outdoors.9,10 Experts on air\nquality and climate have shared insights with the media, discussing the evidence\nfor the impacts of the pandemic-related shutdowns on the environment and\nimplications for future environmental policy. Finally, as the academics among us\nhave rapidly adjusted to online education and the new needs and concerns of their\nstudents, many have developed and openly shared educational materials online.\nAlthough we remain socially distanced for now, it has been heartening to see the\ncommunity come together in this time of acute human and societal need.",
