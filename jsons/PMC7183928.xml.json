The SNS exists under the authority of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated by Sandoz\u2122, the Novartis\u2122 generics and biosimilars division, and one million doses of chloroquine phosphate donated by Bayer Pharmaceuticals\u2122 for potential use in treating patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 or for use in clinical trials. In addition to the SNS donations, these companies and potentially others could offer additional doses (www.fda.gov). There was an expectation that companies would increase production for the commercial market as well to avoid shortages for patients with autoimmune disease who rely on hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil\u00ae) for routine treatment [4].",

The antiviral effect is believed to be from chloroquine\u2019s ability to increase endosomal and lysosomal pH thereby attenuating the ability of the virus to release its genetic material into the cell and replicate. The drug also inhibits important post-translational steps in newly formed proteins, acts as a zinc ionophore that increases intracellular zinc concentration and inhibits RNA-dependent polymerases, decreases endosomal release of iron required for the replication of DNA and inhibits glycosylation of envelope glycoproteins (reviewed in Savarino [6]).",

It is corrected for the heart rate and referred to as the QTc interval. Prolongation of repolarization is caused by an increase of inward current through sodium or calcium channels or a decrease in outward current through potassium channels. The normal value in adults is 470 ms in men and 480 ms in women. The normal QTc interval is shorter in children. A sudden prolongation of QTc interval (greater than 20\u201330% above baseline) or an absolute value > 500 ms increases the risk for ventricular tachycardia that can be life-threatening. Other intervals, including the PR (atrial depolarization and conduction leading up to ventricular depolarization) are shown",
