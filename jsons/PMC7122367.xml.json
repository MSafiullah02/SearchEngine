The major aim of this chapter is to increase the understanding of interstitial lung disease among pediatric pulmonologists, neonatologists, radiologists, and pathologists who take care of affected infants and children. Increasing the understanding of these challenging disorders should result in early and correct diagnosis, which in turn will improve patient care.",

This reported prevalence is likely to be substantially underestimated, particularly given the increased recognition of interstitial lung diseases in the pediatric population in recent years, due to (1) a recently developed classification system for categorizing pediatric interstitial lung disease, (2) increased recognition particularly of the unique interstitial lung diseases that occur in infants, and (3) increased use of thoracoscopic lung biopsy in pediatric patients for definitive diagnosis. Additionally, although the prevalence of any single-specific interstitial lung disease is low, the combination of the varied types of interstitial lung diseases in the pediatric population may be sizable as a collective group. A national registry or large prospective multicenter studies focusing on the evaluation of the true prevalence of interstitial lung disease in infants and children is currently needed.",

Three major challenges include, first, the fact that interstitial lung disease is less common in infants and children compared with adults. Therefore, most clinicians and radiologists are less familiar with considering and recognizing interstitial lung disease in this patient population. Second, the clinical manifestations of interstitial lung disease particularly in infants and the young child are often subtle, highly variable, and typically nonspecific, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, crackles, and hypoxemia. Lastly, there are currently no pathognomonic clinical or laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in pediatric patients. Some of the major uncertainties involving interstitial lung disease in this population include (1) the paucity of information regarding the natural history of interstitial lung disease in childhood, (2) the lackof understanding of the role of specific host factors in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease, and (3) the absence of information on prognostic indicators in interstitial lung disease in childhood and more particularly in infants. Due to the above-stated challenges and uncertainties, evaluation and diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in childhood and particularly in infants has been markedly limited in the past.",

First, there has been substantial confusion and difficulty associated with thedescription and classification of specific interstitial lung diseases in infants and young children with multiple terms used for similar abnormalities and sometimes the same term used for differing conditions, and there has been a tendency to attempt to fit these pediatric disorders into the diagnostic schema used for adults. As the adult ILD classification became more refined and as more knowledge was gained about certain forms of infant ILD, it became clear that using the adult classification was both suboptimal and limiting as conditions common in adults are rare or nonexistent in infants and children and recently recognized infant conditions have no place in the adult classification. Second, the adult ILD classification system did not acknowledge the important role of heritable and genetic disorders that have become widely recognized as an important component of ChILD. The recognition of the role of genetic disorders of the surfactant systemwas pivotal in changing this understanding. And now genetic underpinnings are being sought for a wider group of ChILD. Classifying ILD in the pediatric patient based on the adult ILD classification system is no longer a viable approach.",

            "text": "Recognition of the substantial differences between pediatric and adult ILD led to the evolution of the current and evolving classification system for ChILD. A European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force addressed this issue in a retrospective review of 185 pediatric cases of chronic interstitial lung disease in immunocompetent patients; most, but not all, had lung biopsy and histologic material, which was not reviewed as part of this project; the diagnoses made at initial examination were accepted. The ERS review divided the diagnoses made clinically into four categories based on a proposal by Fan and Langston [11]: (1) diffuse lung parenchymal disease of unknown association (drug reaction, aspiration, connective tissue disorders, infection, environmental disorders); (2) idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)), cellular/fibrotic,\ndesquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP),\nlymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP), diffuse alveolar damage/acute interstitial pneumonia (DAD/AIP),\norganizing pneumonia (OP), usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) to include familial cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, and chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI); (3) other forms of interstitial pneumonia to include lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Langerhans cell granulomatosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), sarcoidosis, eosinophilic pneumonia, idiopathic/infantile pulmonary hemosiderosis; and (4) congenital disorders (DIP , LIP, lipoid pneumonia, NSIP/UIP, and surfactant deficiencies). Although this concept was an important step toward an improved understanding and diagnosis of ChILD, there was clearly a need for further refinement, particularly as diagnostic criteria were not provided for these entities,disorders of immunocompromised children were not addressed, and the requirement for chronicity excluded severe and rapidly progressive conditions. Additionally, adult terminology continued to be used in large part for quite different entities, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP),conditions that are common in adults but vanishingly rare in childhood. This study was a major advance in redirecting thinking about ChILD, and it is important for this reason but does not truly present a new classification system, nor did it resolve many of the issues leading to diagnostic confusion.",

This new pediatric interstitial lung disease classification system was validated for infants and very young children in a retrospective review of 186 lung biopsies done between 1999 and 2004 [7] with accompanying clinical histories and images from children under age 2 contributed by 11 pediatric institutions in North America. The importance of thisnew classification system lies in its acknowledgment of the unique nature of ILD in infants and the overlap of other lung disorders seen in infants and young children with the varied spectrum of conditions seen in older children and adults. Based on this new classification system, ChILD is classified into three main groups: (1) disorders of infancy, (2) other categories (not specific to infancy), and (3) unclassifiable. This expandable and flexible system for categorization has gained wide clinical recognition. This chapter uses this classification scheme (Table 8.1) as its organizing principal focusing initially on those disorders seen almost exclusively during infancy and not in older children or adults.\n",

Due to their rapid clinical course of respiratory failure, most infants with this type of interstitial lung disease die during the first 2 months of life despite supportive management, including advanced ventilation support strategies, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and therapeutic interventions for PHT. Infants with acinar dysplasia, the rarest of these conditions, present at birth, and their survival is shortest. While most reported cases are female infants, male infants may be affected as well. Those with CADtypically present within hours of birth and require continuous and often maximal supportive measures for survival; with such support, they may survive weeks but cannot be weaned from these measures. Infants with ACD/MPV typically present within the first few days of birth, but a few have a delayed presentation at weeks or sometimes a few months of age. Once they present, their course with respiratory failure and PHT rarely ameliorates, and death by 1 month following presentation is the usual outcome.",

In addition, the majority of infants with ACD/MPV have other congenital anomalies most commonly involving the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (including absence of the gallbladder), and/or genitourinary system. A search for the genetic basis of ACD/MPV has resulted in the recent recognition of the mutation/microdeletion of the FOXF1 gene in a proportion of ACD/MPV cases, and the recognition of familial cases highlights the need for genetic testing and counseling in cases with suspected ACD/MPV. As genetic abnormalities have not been found for acinar dysplasiaor CAD, and as all ACD/MPV cases have not yet had a genetic mechanism identified, the definitive diagnosis of these developmental disorders currently rests on the pathological analysis of the lung tissue from biopsy and/or postmortem specimens.",

Histologic changes in ACD/MPV (Fig. 8.3) are less clearly reminiscent of a specific stage in lung development, but there is lobular underdevelopment with variable and sometimes marked alveolar enlargement and reduced capillary density.

A family history of lung disease may be present in such infants and is common in those with SpC mutations. On laboratory examination, PAS-positive material identified in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be potential clues in the diagnosis of surfactant dysfunction disorders. Genetic analysis is considered the definitive diagnostic test, although lung biopsy is often done for categorization and for prognosis and treatment considerations while awaiting the results of genetic testing. Lung biopsy is also definitive for those without as yet recognized genetic mutation and often guides the workup of those with rare genetic disorders in this category. The current treatment for infants with surfactant dysfunction disorders presenting with interstitial lung disease varies based on the degree of clinical symptoms and the underlying genetic defect. Aggressive chronic ventilation for infants with respiratory failure is currently most often performed for infants with a SpC mutation, and lung transplant is the only effective therapeutic option for infantswith SpB mutation. Those with ABCA3 mutations have a more varied presentation and course, at least in part depending on the specific mutation involved. In older children with ABCA3, there is a high incidence of pectus excavatum [32]. There are a few cases of SpB and ABCA3 mutations that have been noted anecdotally to respond to hydroxychloroquine therapy.",

Such imaging findings can result from abnormalities caused by an acute infectious process involving airways and interstitium. Airway abnormalities (e.g., bronchial wall thickening, irregular aeration, atelectasis) and interstitial abnormalities (e.g., fine linear markings, interlobular septal thickening, small nodular opacities) can mimic interstitial lung disease in children with normal immune function. In general, viral rather than bacterial pulmonary infection results in imaging findings similar to those of interstitial lung disease in children. Clinical history, laboratory findings, prior imaging studies, and follow-up imaging studies can provide helpful information to differentiate abnormal pulmonary imaging findings due to acute pulmonary infection from those of underlying interstitial lung disease.",

On plain chest radiographs, the affected lung is hyperlucent and relatively underperfused while maintaining normal or decreased lung volume, although it can be normal in appearance. CT findings of constrictive/obliterative bronchiolitis are characterized by (1) air trapping, accentuated on expiration; (2) mosaic attenuation pattern; (3) bronchial wall thickening; (4) bronchiectasis; and (5) diminished small vessels. Although these CT findings should suggest a diagnosis of constrictive/obliterative bronchiolitis in children, other more common entities, such as acute viral bronchiolitis, should be considered unless air trapping and bronchiectasis are both present.Follow-up imaging study can be helpful in differentiating the changes of chronic postinfectious airway injury from acute viral bronchiolitis. In cases of acute viral bronchiolitis, follow-up imaging studies will show normalization of the previously abnormal imaging findings after resolution of symptoms (although imaging abnormalities may persist for up to a few months), while persistent or worsening abnormalities will be present in cases of irreversible constrictive/obliterative bronchiolitis.",

Such fibrosis may eventuate in marked luminal narrowing, and complete airway obliteration may occur. This can be difficult to identify histologically. Clues to its presence include the identification of small pulmonary arteries without associated airways and residual airway smooth muscle fibers embedded in the fibrotic tissue. This latter finding may be subtle, and may require special stains to highlight smooth muscle. There is often variable hyperexpansion of pulmonary lobules in affected regions.

Pleuritis (c) is a common feature of these disorders and may be active with cellular infiltrates or be present as pleural fibrosis with less prominent infiltrates. Airway changes may include lymphocytic or follicular bronchiolitis, constrictive bronchiolitis with subepithelial fibrosis narrowing the bronchiolar lumen (d) and bronchiectasis. Chronic interstitial pneumonia (e, f) with alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and exudates is common and may be patchy but is often widespread; acute alveolitis and capillaritis can be seen in this setting as well. Features of organizing pneumonia are also common in this setting (g) with streaming fibroblasts in alveolar ducts. In addition to capillaritis, other vascular changes, including thrombosis (h) and evidence of recent (i) and remote hemorrhage (j) (iron stain) with hemosiderin deposition, may also be seen. The pattern of interstitial pneumonia may vary, but in childhood it is most often nonspecific interstitial pneumonia with a variable mixture of cellular and fibrotic components or organizing pneumonia with intralveolar and bronchiolar organization of exudate by proliferated fibroblasts (k)",

CAD shows developmental arrest that ranges from the canalicular to the early saccular stage. The left column shows images from the lung of a near-term male infant who developed respiratory distress at a few hours of age and was supported with supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation for 2 weeks. An echocardiogram showed pulmonary hypertension. The upper left panel is an overview of the lung histology and also shows dilated lymphatic channels in the pleura and an interlobular septum, but not adjacent to airways and arteries. The lobules are composed of simple saccular structures that in the left middle panel are seen to have the somewhat irregular internal configuration seen with secondary crest formation and the wider airspace walls consistent with the early saccular stage of development. In the lower left panel, a well-developed pattern of capillaries is evident, oriented to the airspace epithelium in a normal fashion. There is no deficiency of capillary development in this case, although it may be seen occasionally in association with CAD. Small pulmonary arteries in the lower left panel have mildly increased medial smooth muscle. A single small bronchiole is also evident in the lower left panel. The right hand panels show images from the lung of a near-term female infant who developed hypoxia and respiratory failure shortly after birth. She survived 3 days. This lung shows an earlier developmental stage with far less advanced acinar development. Development is consistent with the canalicular stage. The upper right panel is an overview of lung with only small numbers of simple elongated airspaces disposed in loose mesenchyme. This is better seen in the middle right panel where somewhat irregular airspaces lined by cuboidal epithelium are separated by abundant mesenchyme. In the lower right panel, the airspace epithelium and capillary development are better seen with capillaries becoming apposed to the epithelium with the formation of small regions with thin air-blood barriers",

Surfactant dysfunction disorders and related abnormalities (f\u2013i) are all surfactant B deficiency images, (j\u2013n) are all surfactant C deficiency images, and (o\u2013t) are all ABCA3 images. Surfactant dysfunction mutations: histologic changes in the infant lung in the surfactant dysfunction mutations are stereotypical with lobular remodeling (surfactant B (h)), surfactant C (j), ABCA3 (q) uniform diffuse alveolar epithelial hyperplasia (surfactant B (i)), surfactant C (j, k), ABCA3 (o), at least some element of proteinosis (surfactant B (i)), surfactant C (j\u2013m), ABCA3 (r, s), and often at least a few cholesterol clefts (ABCA3 (o, s)). These changes are present in all cases regardless of the underlyingabnormality or the histologic pattern. While a variety of histologic patterns have been described in surfactant dysfunction mutations, including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP),desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and chronic pneumonitis of infancy (surfactant C (j)), most cases do not present a single clearly defined pattern. An atypical proteinosis pattern is more frequent with surfactant B mutations (surfactant B (h, i)), a chronic pneumonitis of infancy pattern is more frequent with surfactant C mutations (surfactant C (j)), and ABCA3 shows proteinosis in a chunky fashion (r, s); however, no pattern is specific to a particular abnormality. While mutation analysis is the definitive diagnostic modality, ultrastructural changes in the lamellar bodies of type 2 pneumocytes can be quite helpful for more rapid categorization for prognosis and treatment decisions. These changes are quite specific for ABCA3 where there is a paucity of lamellar bodies (ABCA3 (p)), and those present are tiny, poorly lamellated and contain a dense central inclusion (ABCA3 (t)). SpB mutations also show characteristic ultrastructural changes with fusion of lamellar and multivesicular bodies (surfactant B (f)) and absence of tubular myelin (surfactant B (g)); there are also reduced numbers of lamellar bodies, which are typically poorly lamellated (not shown). There are no characteristic lamellar body ultrastructural findings with SpC mutations, the type 2 pneumocytes may appear normal (surfactant C (m)), or there may be mild changes in the size and distribution of lamellar bodies (surfactant C (n))",

Cases of PIG typically show at least some element of alveolar growth abnormality in the background, as seen in (b) with enlarged airspaces. In PIG, the lobular interstitium is widened by an accumulation of bland-appearing cells with abundant pale to bubbly cytoplasm (b\u2013d). Other features vary depending on the underlying conditions affecting the infant. There may be mild and patchy alveolar epithelial hyperplasia (b\u2013d); it is not a necessary feature and is almost never prominent and diffuse; there also may be pulmonary arterial changes of hypertensive vasculopathy (not illustrated). The large pale interstitial cells are immunopositive for vimentin (e) but not for macrophage or epithelial markers, suggesting that they are mesenchymal in type. Definitive diagnosis requires the identification of these large bland interstitial cells by electron microscopy. These cells widen the alveolar interstitium (f); they have bland nuclei and a paucity of cytoplasmic organelles (g), and their cytoplasm contains abundant monoparticulate glycogen (e).
