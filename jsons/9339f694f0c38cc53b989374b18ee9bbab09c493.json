Are there plausible explanations for the great variability in disease prevalence within the different countries?

One study indicated that variation in prevalence could be due to differences in transmission and migration rates [3] . What enabled China to contain the spread of the epidemic was most certainly the coordinated effort of the central government to shut down Wuhan on January 23 rd , followed on January 24 th by the shutdown of another 15 cities: since then the number of new cases began to go down. This extremely successful endeavor is the result of draconian measures implemented with military discipline, and thus this measure maybe difficult to implement in western countries.",

There was a variation in the risk of death in a study from China. -The estimates of the risk for death was 12% in the epicenter of Wuhan and 1% in other, more mildly affected areas [5] . A higher average age of the population, (particularly in Italy with a median age of (47.4 years), accompanying higher percentage of comorbidities, most likely play a significant role in death rates. In one study, older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with increased mortality [6] . Sadly, in certain instances, it appears that the underlying cause of dramatically higher mortality, to this date, was a drastic decrease in availability of critical resources. This decrease in resources leads to a functional collapse of the healthcare system and an overwhelmingly and unmanageable surge of people needing assistance in the intensive care units.",
