Asthma attack was defined as the presence of progressive cough, wheezing, dyspnea or chest tightness accompanied by low forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) values in a previously diagnosed asthmatic patient. The asthma attack score, pulmonary index score, need for systemic steroid, hospitalization and number of bronchodilators in the first 6 h of attack were also assessed for the patients in the acute asthma group.16, 17 Regular medications were recorded in all patients. The asthma attack and controlled asthma groups were matched by mild to moderate severity in the previous three months and they were monosensitised to house dust mites. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) presence of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in the acute asthma group; and (2) no symptoms of URTI in the preceding six weeks in the controlled asthma group. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) presence of chronic lung disease or severe asthma; (2) sensitization to allergen other than mite; and (3) use of drugs or a chronic disease that can affect the levels of serum vit D.",

Unadjusted comparisons were made using the Independent samples t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous endpoints and the Chi-Square test for categorical endpoints. The logarithm of cathelicidin was calculated because of the wide range of values. Correlations were assessed using the Spearman's correlation test. The possible factors identified with univariate analysis (p\n < 0.25) and the ones that were considered clinically important were further entered into the multiple regression analysis to determine the independent predictors. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify independent predictors of serum IP-10 levels. The risk factors that could influence the development of asthma attacks were evaluated in all asthmatics with multiple logistic analysis. Roc curve analysis was performed to determine the cut-off value for IP-10 to predict the development of a viral asthma attack. Odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals were estimated. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

The interactions between virus and TLR signaling cascades result in the activation of type 1 interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines and IP-10.21 We also confirmed that serum IP-10 levels were significantly higher in the viral-induced asthma attack group. Another innate immune molecule, human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, which is a multifunctional host defence molecule is essential for normal immune responses to infections.23, 24, 25 In addition to the antimicrobial effects, cathelicidin also has immunomodulatory properties such as chemoattractant function, inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis, tissue regeneration and cytokine release.26, 27 Previous studies suggested that cathelicidin could be used as a marker for a strong systemic immune response in viral or bacterial infections.28, 29 Similarly, the current study and our previous report revealed that serum cathelicidin levels were significantly higher in the viral-induced acute asthma group.30\n",

            "text": "Serum cathelicidin levels showed a significant positive correlation with IL-6 and a negative correlation with IL-4 and IL-13 levels in our study. Previous studies showed that human cathelicidin elicited a modest up-regulation of IL-6 gen expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.34 The anti-inflammatory properties of cathelicidin are demonstrated by its antagonistic action on IL-4 responses.5 In addition, IP-10 may also contribute to this antagonistic action on IL-4. The overexpression of IP-10 decreased IL-4 release and eosinophil recruitment to the airways in an OVA-sensitized mouse model.35 IP-10 interacts with CXCR3, a receptor that is highly expressed on activated CD4+, CD8+ and NKT cells and stimulates the migration of these cells.11 T cells expressing CXCR3 were associated with Th1 inflammation and IP-10 were even reported to show antagonistic effects on the Th2 cell mediated immune response.36\n",

A relationship between TLR2 and IP-10 is less well characterized as it has both synergistic and antagonistic effects between TLR2 and TLR3 pathways, which may be stimulus dependent.39, 40 Wood et al. showed that IP-10 gen expression in sputum was correlated with TLR2 and TLR3 in viral-induced acute asthma.41\n",

Viral infections may lead to the release of IP-10 in bronchial epithelium that enhances the asthmatic airway inflammation and migration and the activation of mast cells into the airway smooth muscle.45, 46 These data clearly indicate that in individuals with pre-existing asthmatic airway inflammation, IP-10 is capable of worsening the inflammation and bronchoconstriction. Moreover, the involvement of IP-10 may explain the lack of corticosteroid efficacy in virus-induced asthma. Wark et al. confirmed that the levels of serum IP-10 of subjects with acute asthma were strongly associated with more severe airflow obstruction and a reduced \u03b22-agonist bronchodilator response.46 A previous study by Medoff et al. showed that IP-10 contributed to airway hyperreactivity and airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma.8 In the present study, a significant positive correlation was found between IP-10 and the parameters of asthma attack severity in the acute asthma group. Also, a significant negative correlation was found between serum IP-10 levels and spirometric indices.",
