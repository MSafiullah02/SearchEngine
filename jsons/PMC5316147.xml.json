The incidence rates of hospital-acquired and intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired AKI are approximately 21.6%, and 40%, respectively [2]. The mortality of ICU patients with AKI is 1.5-2 times higher compared to ICU patients without AKI, indicating that AKI can act as an independent risk factor of death in the ICU [2]. At present, risk of development and severity of AKI cannot be reliably predicted from common clinical risk factors. The possible genetic predisposition to AKI or the influence of a certain genetic background on AKI patient outcome still remains to be elucidated [3].",

In addition to its role in surfactant homeostasis, SP-D plays an important role in innate immunity and the regulation of inflammation in the lung [5]. SP-D can activate intracellular phagocytosis and regulate the regeneration of intracellular reactive oxygen species and cytokines [6]. A previous study has demonstrated that levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in SP-D knockout mice with radiation-induced lung injury were significantly higher than those in wild-type mice [6]. Moreover, in the same study, exogenous SP-D supplementation delivered through the airways reduced lung injury. We have shown in our recent studies that besides expression in the lung, SP-D is also expressed in several other organs such as the pancreas [7] and kidney [8]. We also demonstrated that extra-pulmonary SP-D plays an important role in the pathogenesis of infectious disease through its role in the regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways and apoptosis [7, 8]. In addition, we have also shown that in a CLP-induced sepsis model, SP-D knockout mice showed a higher degree of severity of kidney injury than wild-type mice [9].",

All participants recruited in this study were Han Chinese. The diagnosis and stage of AKI were established in accordance with the criteria of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) issued by the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) in 2012 [13]. AKI was defined as serum creatinine (Scr) elevation exceeding 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 mol/L) within 48 h, or Scr elevation exceeding 1.5 fold of the baseline value, or urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 6 h. AKI was classified into three stages: Stage 1, Scr elevation exceeding 1.5\u20131.9 fold of the baseline level, or Scr elevation exceeding 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 mol/L) or urine output less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6\u201312 h; Stage 2, Scr elevation exceeding 2.0\u20132.9 fold of the baseline level, or urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 12 h; Stage 3, Scr elevation exceeding 3.0 fold of the baseline level, or Scr elevation exceeding 4.0 mg/dL (353.6 \u03bcmol/L), or need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Patients younger than 18 years or older than 70 years of age, pregnant women, and patients with chronic renal disease and renal contusions were excluded from the study.

Compared with healthy controls, the frequency of 11Thr/Thr genotype was significantly increased in AKI patients (p = 0.001). In addition, the frequency of 11Thr allele in AKI patients was also significantly higher than in healthy controls (p = 0.001). Moreover, the frequency of the 11Thr/Thr genotype was significantly higher in the subgroup of sepsis-induced AKI patients and patients who subsequently died when compared to the subgroup of the controls and survivors, respectively (p = 0.001& p = 0.0013), suggesting that SP-D-Thr11Met polymorphisms may be a predictor of worse outcomes in AKI patients. No significant differences in terms of genotype and allele frequencies at Thr160Ala loci were observed between AKI patients and healthy controls (p = 0.269) (Tables 2 and 3).\n\n",

Interestingly, recipients of allografts with SP-D 11Met/Met genotype had significantly lower rates of chronic lung allograft dysfunction and improved survival compared to those with the homozygous SP-D 11Thr/Thr genotype [19]. In our study, individuals with 11Thr/Thr genotype were more susceptible to AKI compared to those with other SP-D genotypes. In addition, to avoid potential problems due to different race, region and living environments among subjects, all AKI patients and healthy controls in this study were of Chinese Han nationality and resided in similar geographic locations in the central area of China. In our study, frequencies of genotypes at Thr11Met and Thr160Ala loci in healthy controls were similar to those reported in previous studies conducted in the Chinese population [20]. However, the distribution of genotypes in the Chinese population differed from that reported in Western populations [11]. Thus, based on our findings, we can speculate that the SP-D-Thr11Met polymorphism may be used a biomarker to predict patient susceptibility to AKI of Chinese patients.",

The Met11Thr polymorphism is located in codon 11 in the SP-D N-terminal region and it has been reported previously that this amino acid change influences the oligomerization of the human SP-D protein thereby impacting on its function [10]. Furthermore, SP-D protein posttranslational modifications such as nitrosylation of multimeric SP-D could cause collagen tail wrapping and affect SP-D binding ability to the calreticulin/CD91 receptor on macrophages. This, in turn, might lead to higher anti-inflammatory activity as compared with normal trimeric SP-D protein [21]. Moreover, a previous study demonstrated that multimeric SP-D protein was a better inhibitor of Gram-positive and negative bacteria as well as influenza virus A compared to SP-D, with a lower degree oligomerization [22]. In our study, we found that AKI subjects with 11Thr/Thr genotype had higher serum SP-D levels than those with 11Met/Met and 11Thr/Met genotypes, which may also contribute to individual susceptibility to AKI. These findings might be explained by the possibility that SP-D Thr11Met SNP could influence the assembly, expression, function and concentration of SP-D protein, consequently altering susceptibility to diseases in which SP-D is implicated.",

[23] demonstrated that higher baseline plasma SP-D levels were associated with a greater risk of mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. Indeed, higher baseline serum SP-D levels were associated with worse clinical outcomes, including a higher degree of kidney injury, longer RRT duration and increased risk of death in our study. It has been shown previously that alveolar type II epithelial cell hyperplasia can be stimulated by intra-tracheal administration of KGF-2 to increase SP-D secretion. SP-D easily disseminates into blood vessels due to its hydrophilic nature, therefore, serum SP-D level may be used as a sensitive marker of the permeability of alveolar epithelial cells [24]. In the present study, serum SP-D levels in AKI patients were significantly higher than that in healthy controls, and reached a peak at day three. We speculate that increased serum SP-D levels in AKI patients may be attributed to large amounts of SP-D protein secreted by renal tubular epithelial cells which may accumulate in renal tubular lumen. In addition, SP-D protein from the tubular lumen may leak into the lumen of blood vessels when the barrier function of tubular epithelial cells is damaged. The permeability of tubular epithelial cells is related with the severity of renal injury, When the kidney suffers injury, and the more severely the renal epithelial cell barrier is damaged, the more SP-D protein would leak into blood from tubular lumen,which may explain the significant correlation between higher serum SP-D levels and higher stage of renal injury in AKI patients.",

Urine KIM-1 levels have been recognized as a useful biomarker to occurrence and severity of sepsis-induced AKI [26]. In the present study, we found that urine KIM-1 levels in AKI stage 3 patients were significantly higher than that in AKI stage 2 and stage 1 patients. In addition, the baseline serum SP-D levels were significantly correlated with urine KIM-1 levels, which further suggested that serum SP-D levels may be a predictor for the severity and prognosis of AKI.
