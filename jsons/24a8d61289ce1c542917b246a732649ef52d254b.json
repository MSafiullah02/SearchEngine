At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed as 2019-nCoV, has broken out and is propagating in China and the world. Here we propose a multi-model ordinary differential equation set neural network (MMODEs-NN) and model-free methods to predict the interprovincial transmissions in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence methods can give consistent and reasonable predictions of the 2019-nCoV ending. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for comprehensive prediction researches of the 2019-nCoV.",

Because the outbreak position is one of the most important transportation hubs 2 and the date is close to the annual Spring Festival travel rush 2 (SFTR), the transmission speed of the virus is faster than that of the SARS in 2003.

To lay a basis for further discussion, we first get the 2019-nCoV daily transmission data 12 from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the CDCs of each province in mainland China from January 10 to February 5, 2020. The data contain the confirmed infected amount, recovered amount and death amount. Then, we also collect the population, density and transportation data of each province during the Chinese SFTR 2 . The three model-free methods, which are based on the sigmoid function 10, 14 , Gaussian function, and Poisson distribution 15 , respectively, only require the daily data. The sigmoid function method requires the total amount of the infected patients, whereas the other two methods require the daily new confirmed data. The MMODEs-NN is a feedforward neural network 16 , which takes all the gathered data as the factors and uses the last 4 days data as the test set. The neurons in this neural network are activated by the proposed susceptible-exposedinfected-recovered-susceptible-death (SEIRSD) ODEs, and each of them stores the variable states. Similar to the recurrent neural networks 17 , the network can calculate the states for each time step recurrently, and the neuron links can simulate the interprovincial disease transmission in neuron wide propagation and population change according to the transportation data. With certain error evaluation and optimization methods 18 , the parameters of the model, such as the disease spreading parameters, can be learned.

            "text": "Here we present the prediction results of the 2019-nCoV transmission. Let us denote January 10, 2020, as the 1st day in the training and prediction intervals. When using model-free methods, the results are dependent on the original data. The predictions of these methods are shown in Figs. 1-3, respectively. From these results, one can see that the earliest ending would be the end of February. For the MMODEs-NN, the results are less dependent on the data, so we can train under hypotheses to avoid overfitting and data problems. In general, one has known that the central government of China has taken stronger policies than those in 2003, and we assume that the CDCs in China can count the confirmed patients with no delay. With the help of conjugate gradient method on optimizing the parameters of the disease and transportations, the simulation shows that the ratios between the contact population and the population-area density in other provinces are 8 \u00d7 10 !\" , while the ratio in Hubei Province is 0.086 (108x). In this situation, the countrywide total confirmed count would be around 40000. The prediction results are depicted in Fig. 4 and imply that the slowdown would begin on February 7, and the ending would exist before March. However, every disease has a certain time for the researchers to identify. From the latest data, one can see that the data of Hubei Province's total confirmed amount has a boom since January 28, which means the possible existence of this delay. Figs. 5 and 6 suggest the delay situation. The ratio in Hubei Province would be 0.103 (129x), and the countrywide confirmed count would be at the scale of 46000 if the statistical delay is 1 day, while the ratio of Hubei Province would be 0.135 (169x) and the countrywide confirmed count would be at the scale of 58000 if a 2-day delay exists. All the prediction results are listed in Table S7 . In these situations, overestimations are acceptable and common in the beginning, and the deceleration date of the transmission would be around February 10, and the ending would happen in March.",

The central government of China also declared other policies to help people and find potential patients under the difficulties, such as prolonging the Spring Festival vacation and conducting strict body temperature measurements in blocks 19 . We consider these policies and code them with the proposed network. According to transportation data in the Supplementary Information, the traffic during the 2020 Spring Festival in China decreases by 90% compared with that in 2019. These policies help to control the disease and shrink the total confirmed amounts in each province. We also conduct another simulation without these policies, and the results plotted in Fig. 7 show that the final infected patient amount would reach 450000. In this situation, the most optimistic deceleration date is February 26, and the ending would be around April 28. Thus, these policies work, and their effects are undoubtedly obvious.",

From the experiments, one can see that the model-free methods and the proposed MMODEs-NN can give consistent and confident predictions on the disease and the transmission of the coronavirus would be under control soon. However, every predictive method has its corresponding advantages and shortcomings. The model-free methods show statistical predictions by learning the general form of the developing data, while the proposed MMODEs-NN generates predictions from the simulation by synthesizing the data independency of the ODEs dynamic system and the fitting power of neural networks. For model-free methods, due to the dependency of the data, they are fast to learn the data pattern but would be more likely to make errors if the real-time data are incorrect or have latencies; for the ODEs-NN combined model, it requires more time to train and generate overfitting problems but it can find the human-like errors in the training data and provide more independent predictions. Both of them have strengths, and the predictions would be more robust and more possible to happen if their results are consistent. Additionally, a variety of uncertain random events happen in real life. For example, the boom in Zhejiang is related to clustering and weak related to the concerned factors in the simulations of MMODEs-NN. However, for the total confirmed amount, our models are relatively accurate, even if the CDC has lowered the standard of judging the confirmed patients since February 9. Thus, we summarize the predicted endings in Table 1 and conservatively estimate that the transmission of the 2019-nCoV would slow down before February 18 and the transmission of this year would finally come to the ending before April.

In this work, we present a fully connected feedforward SEIRSD ODEsactivated neural network with multi-model techniques. To make a robust simulation, the proposed network is designed to have 31 SEIRSD-activated neurons in each layer which represents the corresponding time step, and the structure is shown in Fig. S1 . The neuron can store some basic information of the corresponding province, such as the population and density. The links between the layers are fully connected to propagate the interprovincial population change during the SFTR. The weights of the links are controlled by the transportation data, which is listed in Table S5 .

For the network initialization, the neurons are loaded with the population and density information of the corresponding province. The network calculates the errors on the training set automatically and adopts the parameters with the best performance on the test set. Similar to the recurrent neural network 4, 5 , the network shares the parameters and makes predictions by calculating the neuron states in a layer-layer loop. If we want to simulate the delayed situation, we can first propagate and reset the delayed neuron states, which is similar to remove the self-link of the delayed neuron. With the help of numerical optimization methods, such as conjugate gradient 6 and gradient descendent, the parameters in the network can be learned.",

One can see from the results are close to each other, which means that the transmission of the 2019-nCoV would stop before April. Thus, we conservatively estimate that the transmission of the 2019-nCoV would slow down before February 15 and the transmission of this year would finally come to the ending before April.However, the ending of the transmission does not mean the vanishment of the 2019-nCoV. The meaning of vanishment means that all the patients are recovered or died, and the infected probabilities are lower than the beginning of the outbreak, while the transmission ending means that the transmission is under control, and the total confirmed amount would not increase in a large scale. In general, after the ending, the virus would be less likely to break out again, but still has the variation probability and arouse multi-cycle transmission, which is important for the medical staff to care about. What is more, from the simulations shown in the article, we can see that the treatment cycle is long, and the potential death rate is high. Although the medical levels in the provinces are not considered, the data from January 10 to February 5 imply the information, and the optimized simulations have shown this warning. For a deeper estimation, we conservatively estimate that the final vanishment would be before August 2020.Fig. S1 (a) SEIRSD neuron structure and state transition diagram. (b) Structure of SEIRSD MMODEs-NN for predicting 2019-nCov transmission ending. We first gather the provincial basic information to initialize the network. In each neuron, there is a SEIRSD model. The weights are calculated with the transportation data and the 2020 SFTR model. For each time step, the neurons receive the inputs from the last time step neurons, reinitiate the neurons with the latest states, calculate the SEIRSD model with the noncontact-contact model in the current time step, and propagate to next layer. The test set in the simulations are the latest 4-day data, and the error evaluation method is MAE. The parameters in the network can be learned with conjugate gradient and gradient descendent.",
