URTI is the main cause of asthma exacerbations in children and adults and a major risk factor for admission in hospital every autumn. Asthmatic patients are concerned about acute asthma exacerbations following a common cold, asking how to minimize the risk during the winter viral season. Acute exacerbations are associated with decreased lung growth and, as such, add to both the cost and morbidity associated with asthma. Viral respiratory infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in children (80-85%) and are a major risk factor for admission to a hospital. HRVs are the most common viral agents. Current drugs for the prevention and treatment of virus-induced exacerbation of asthma are poorly effective, and novel alternative therapies are needed. There are a growing number of clinical trials using probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for the prevention of respiratory infections in asthmatic individuals. Proposed mechanisms include probiotics compete against pathogens; increase the barrier function in respiratory epithelium; immunostimulatory effects by enhancing cellular immunity with increased activity of natural killer cells and macrophages in airways (Hales et al., 2012; Holt and Sly, 2011) .",

In an experimental model of lung inflammation based on the administration of the artificial viral pathogenassociated molecular pattern, in order to mimic the proinflammatory and physiopathological consequences of RNA viral infections in the lung, after oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL 1505 and CRL 1506, the authors found that CRL 1506 had no effect, whereas CRL 1505 increased bronchoalveolar lavage concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-10, and the number of pulmonary CD3 + CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + T cells. The preventive effects on the respiratory airway immunity induced by CRL 1505 suggested that, if the target of probiotic administration is to prevent recurrent URTIs, an appropriate strain of L. rhamnosus should be selected (Esposito et al., 2014) . Zelaya et al. (2014) demonstrated that the preventive treatment with the probiotic bacteria beneficially modulates the fine tune balance between clearing respiratory viruses (RSV and influenza virus) and controlling immune-coagulative responses in the lung, allowing normal lung function to be maintained in the face of a viral attack. Their data also pinpoint a crucial role for IL-10 in the immune protection induced by L. rhamnosus CRL 1505 during respiratory viral infections.",

In a randomized trial, 479 healthy adults (aged 18-67) were supplemented daily with vitamins and minerals with or without the probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium longum, B. bifidum) for at least 3 months during two winter/spring periods. The total symptom score, the duration of common cold episodes, and days with fever during an episode were lower in the probiotic-treated group than in the control group . In another study, consumption of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus paracasei reduced the incidence of acquiring one or more common cold episode from 67% in the control group to 55% in the probiotic group. Also, the number of days with common cold symptoms was significantly reduced from 8.6 days in the control group to 6.2 days in the probiotic group, during the 12-week period (Berggren et al., 2011) . In healthy adults, L. fermentum reduced the number of RTIs and increased antigen-specific IgA formation after influenza virus vaccination (Olivares et al., 2007) . A combination of L. rhamnosus GG and B. animalis reduced both the duration and severity of upper respiratory infections (Smith et al., 2013) .",

A better understanding of the effects of different probiotic strains and their combination, selection of the most beneficial strains, the dose and timing of supplementation for various age groups, and a deeper insight into their mechanisms of action are needed for the validation of specific strains carrying a potential to modify the frequency and severity of RTIs (Homayouni Rad et al., 2013) . Functional foods such as probiotic milk or yogurt containing well-defined probiotic strains may reduce the risk of catching the common cold and represent a simple, safe, effective, and available method for preventing respiratory infections especially in developing countries. Further research to establish the role of probiotics and prebiotics in the treatment and prevention of RTIs is required and should also clarify if any susceptible subgroups of respiratory diseases exist, and how these subgroups benefit from supplementation with certain probiotic strains.",
