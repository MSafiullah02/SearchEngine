In mice, enhanced disease has an immunopathological basis, characterized by polarized type 2-helper (TH2) response. Increased IL-4 production has been associated with pulmonary histopathology and eosinophilia [13], [14], [15]. In calves, enhanced pathology has been associated with elevated IgE titers and marked eosinophilia, suggesting a TH2-mediated immune response [16], [17], [18].

Neutralizing antibodies to the F protein can mediate protection [22]. However, serum antibodies provide greater contribution in reducing BRSV induced lower respiratory disease than upper respiratory tract virus shedding [4], [23]. The cell-mediated immunity is also a critical parameter in the outcome of RSV infection [24], [25]. The F, P, G, M, M2 and N proteins are antigenic targets recognized by bovine CD8+ T cells, the latter two proteins being also specific targets for murine (M2 protein) or murine and human (N protein) CD8+ T cells [26], [27], [28], [29]. These cells constitute the major lymphocyte subpopulation in the respiratory tract of calves recovering from BRSV infection and depletion of those cells also induces delayed virus clearance from the lungs and nasopharynges in calves [23], [30], [31]. In mice, diminished CTL activation and migration to the lungs by treatment with anti-LFA-1 delayed viral clearance [32]. Furthermore, priming of the RSV-specific CD8+ response suppressed the eosinophilia induced after challenge of animals vaccinated with the G glycoprotein [33].",

Intramuscular vaccination of mice with plasmid DNA expressing the F or G proteins of RSV has shown to induce a strong TH1 response and to reduce the viral load in the lungs after RSV challenge, without inducing enhanced pulmonary inflammatory response or eosinophilia [35], [36]. However, it is generally recognized that DNA vaccines are often less effective in large animals than in mice [37]. Improvement of the immune response can be achieved by boosting animals previously vaccinated with plasmid DNA with inactivated vaccine. This approach has successfully been used to protect calves against bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) challenge [38]. This strategy was also successfully used in a previous BRSV experiment. Calves vaccinated with codon-optimized plasmid DNA expressing the F and N BRSV proteins and boosted with an inactivated commercial vaccine were protected against clinical signs, gross pneumonic lesions and virus replication [39]. In that study, the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were primed by DNA injection and enhanced by the protein boost. They reduced the clinical signs and the virus replication after BRSV challenge. The use of the F protein of RSV in a prime\u2013boost protocol also represents an interesting strategy for early life immunization [40].",

These 2 antigens have also been tested as vaccine candidates in calves. A plasmid expressing the G glycoprotein afforded only partial reduction of viral shedding after challenge [52], [53]. More recently, DNA vaccine encoding the BRSV fusion protein induced significant protection against the virus challenge, by reducing the nasopharyngeal excretion of the virus and the extent of gross pneumonic lesions. However, complete protection against BRSV was not conferred [54]. Finally, DNA immunization of infant rhesus monkeys or young calves against both the BRSV F and nucleocapsid (N) proteins stimulated both humoral and cell-mediated immunity against the virus and reduced viral replication, clinical signs and pulmonary lesions after challenge [39], [55]. Reports describing the use of the N protein are rather scarce. However, N was shown to be a major target of the immune response against RSV. Vaccination of mice with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the (H)RSV N protein induced partial resistance [56], [57]. Similarly, immunization of young calves with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the BRSV N protein induced non-neutralizing antibodies and primed the BRSV-specific proliferative response and IFN-\u03b3 production that resulted in reduction of viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract [21], [28]. Overall, these data suggest that the protection afforded by the N protein might be largely mediated by cellular immunity.",

This is in accordance with the results published by others. Indeed, vaccination with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the N protein induced local IgG1 but not IgA response [21].

However, the virus replicated in the respiratory tract of the mock-vaccinated animals, the highest viral load being observed in the BAL on day 5 post-infection. At autopsy, the viral load in the lungs was as high as previously described [39] and gross pneumonic as well as histopathological lesions were observed. After injection of the N protein, 2 out the 3 calves were protected against BRSV replication in the lungs. However, high viral loads were detected in the BAL fluids, and protection against pneumonic lesions was only partial. DNA vaccination alone was able to protect against viral replication in the lungs and to strongly reduce the viral replication in the BAL but the calves were not totally protected against the development of gross pneumonic lesions. The presence of lung consolidations at autopsy indicates the spread of the virus in the lungs. Indeed, pathological changes have been shown to appear when replication of BRSV spreads to the alveoli and may continue after clearance of the virus [59]. In contrast, protection against both the viral replication in the lungs and the gross and histological pneumonic lesions was afforded by the combination of DNA and protein vaccination, suggesting that infectious virus was cleared before infecting the alveoli.",

            "text": "The role of the cellular immunity in the protection against RSV and the pathogenesis induced by the virus is controversial. Bovine IFN-\u03b3 has been shown to induce a TH1 response, characterized by IgG2 production [60]. On one hand, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can eliminate the virus but they also cause immunopathology in mice [61]. IFN-\u03b3 was identified as a key molecule involved in both the virus control and the immunopathology induced by CD8+ T cells [62]. In mice, TH1 and TH2 biased T cell responses could either co-exist or down regulate each other [14], [63]. On the other hand, impaired viral clearance and enhanced disease observed after vaccination with FI vaccine have been correlated with decreased IFN-\u03b3 production [64]. Formulation of FI-BRSV with CpG ODN resulted in increased IFN-\u03b3 secretion and reduction of both gross lung pathology and viral replication in calves and in mice [65], [66]. Furthermore, Modified Live vaccine induced cellular immunity, in particular secretion of IFN-\u03b3 by peripheral blood leukocytes, appeared to be a more consistent correlate of protection than pre-challenge serum antibody [67]. Our data are consistent with these results. Indeed, the only animals that were protected against both viral replication in the lungs and the development of macroscopic lung lesions resulting of BRSV challenge were those that had been vaccinated successively with pNsyn and N protein and that exhibited significant IFN-\u03b3 production at the time of the challenge.",

This was not anticipated because other authors showed that insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing the F protein and mixed with Quil A stimulate the cellular-mediated immune response in lambs [68]. However, as baculovirus has been shown as stimulator of immune response, this could contribute to the overall effect of the immunogen [69]. In our experiment, the N protein was nevertheless able to prime for a lymphoproliferative response, detected after BRSV challenge, and this might be attributed to a TH1 triggering of the adjuvant. After vaccination with the N protein, 2 out of the 3 calves were protected against viral replication in the lungs. Virus was detected in the lungs of the remaining calf (calf 6622). Interestingly, this calf had also higher viral load in BAL fluids and more extended lesions of the lungs compared to the 2 other calves of this group. The 3 calves showed identical serological responses. However, when the lymphoproliferative response was individually examined on blood collected 6 days after challenge, the SI was below 1 for calf 6622 and of about 3 for the 2 other calves (data not shown). We hypothesize that the development of pulmonary lesions and the viral replication in the lungs were correlated with the absence of cell-mediated immunity.",

This is in accordance with the results published by others. Indeed, this strategy was recently shown to induce stronger humoral immune response and better protection against BVDV in cattle compared to immunization with DNA or protein alone [70]. Boosting DNA vaccinated mice with recombinants vectors can elicit strong CD4 and CD8 immune responses [71]. Furthermore, it has been shown that the longevity of T-cell stimulation was higher after DNA prime\u2013MLV boost than after MLV vaccination alone against BoHV-1 in cattle [72]. Boosting CD8 response with inactivated virus or recombinant proteins is more controversial. While inactivated viral boost was shown to enhance the CD4 and antibody responses but not the CD8 response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in mice, other authors described an enhancement of CD8+ CTL and CD4+ T-helper cells against HIV after a protein boost in nonhuman primates [73], [74]. Here also, although the cytotoxic T cell response was not investigated, increased lymphoproliferative response and IFN-\u03b3 production were observed, suggesting an enhancement of the cellular response after the protein boost.",

This vaccination strategy elicited both humoral and cellular immune responses. The observed protection correlated with the lymphoproliferative response and the interferon-\u03b3 production. The results also confirm the efficacy of the prime\u2013boost strategy in a large animal model. This strategy is promising for the protection against RSV in cattle and it could also open perspectives for vaccinating young infants as well. Further work should be performed to confirm the present results in neonatal calves harboring maternal antibodies. Finally, further development would combine the nucleocapsid and the fusion proteins in a DNA prime\u2013protein boost strategy in order to stimulate protective cellular immunity and neutralizing antibodies at once.",
