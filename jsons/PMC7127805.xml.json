Fluorination of 8 with DAST gave the fluorinated compound 9 in 88% yield with the desired \u2018\u03b1\u2019 stereochemistry through double inversion mechanism by the nucleophilic participation of the ring sulfur atom.13 Removal of benzoyl group of 9 using cat. NaOMe in MeOH gave the corresponding alcohol 10 in nearly quantitative yield, which was used for coupling with benzoic acid under Mitsunobu conditions.14 During Mitsunobu reaction the nucleophilic participation of sulfur atom occurred only to the extent of 3\u20135%. The major product 11 which underwent a single inversion was formed in 88% yield with its epimer (3\u20135%) at 3-position.

Participation degree of sulfur atom on the sugar ring seems like depending on electron density on the sugar ring, ring strain of the generated episulfonium cation, and properties of nucleophile and leaving group. Mitsunobu reaction of fluorinated compounds (10 and 12) with benzoic acid or nucleobases might have difficulty in forming episulfonium cation because the sugar ring is already electron-poor by electron-withdrawing fluoro group. Therefore, the major product was single inverted one (11, 13, 14, and 18). On the other hand, in case of DAST reaction of compound 8 there is no strong electron-withdrawing group such as a fluorine atom on the sugar ring, implying that participation of the sulfur atom is expected and the major product is double inverted one (9). The remaining things are conversion of 6-chloropurine into adenine base and desilylation of TBDPS group in sequence. Surprisingly, treatment of compound 18 with methanolic ammonia at 80 \u00b0C overnight accomplished not only amination at 6-position of 6-chloropurine base but also desilylation of TBDPS group, giving the final product 4 in 68% yield.",

This observation implies that iso-d-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy sugar templates might act as a sugar surrogate of nucleosides for the development of anti-RNA virus agent. The information about participation of sulfur atom during fluorination reaction using DAST and Mitsunobu reaction will be of great help in synthesizing sulfur-containing compounds.",
