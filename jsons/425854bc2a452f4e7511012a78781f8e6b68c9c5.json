We don't want false positives. \" 1 \"If they are incredibly accurate, we will work out the quickest way to release them. If they are not accurate, we will not release any of them. \" echoed UK Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty 2 .",

If the results of the two tests are independent, the chances of obtaining two false-negative results drops to 9% (and to less than 3% if a third independent test with similar characteristics is administered). Figure 1 illustrates this logic, which also applies to false-positive results, for a test with a 50% false-negative rate. (Reports suggest that the tests being considered for large-scale procurement in the UK are in this range 4,5 ). As a comparison, since 2017, rapid influenza diagnostic tests cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration have been required to achieve false-negative rates and false-positive rates of below 20% and 5%, respectively, compared with RT-PCR 6 .",
