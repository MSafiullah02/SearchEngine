            "text": "The concept of structure-function paradigm that was widely accepted for more than a century tells us that the biological functions of proteins are linked to their rigid three-dimensional (3D) structures.1 The normal functioning of most of the globular proteins (e.g. enzymes) requires the orderly arrangement of various functional groups of amino acids in protein's unique 3D structure to facilitate the catalysis of chemical reactions or other related functions. However, recent research demonstrated that the large fraction of genome-encoded proteins of many organisms lack the well-defined 3D structures, but still play various important roles in cellular functionality. The group of such proteins is generally known as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).2, 3, 4 However, they have multiple alternative names, such as natively denatured,5 natively unfolded,6 intrinsically unstructured,7 natively disordered,8 dancing proteins,9 protein clouds,10, 11 4D,12 malleable,13, 14, 15 chameleon,16 vulnerable,17 intrinsically disordered,18 intrinsically unfolded, intrinsically denatured, flexible,19 mobile,20 pliable,21 rheomorphic,22 and partially folded proteins.23 The different name identities of IDPs are based on their properties observed in different experiments conducted at a different time. The computational analysis reveals that greater than one-third of eukaryotic proteins harbor the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of greater than 30 residues in length.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 In solution, when IDPs are kept alone, they lack a unique 3D structure either in parts or completely.32\n",

This involves interaction with multiple partners and ability to act as highly connected nodes, or hubs, most frequently within the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Hubs are vital for the normal functioning and stability of PPI networks in any organism. It has been shown that the deletion of hub protein could be lethal for that organism.37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 The illustrative examples of disordered hub proteins that bind to around 10\u2013100 binding partners are p21, p27, p53, BRCA1, XPA, \u03b1-synuclein, estrogen receptor,46 etc. IDRs within disordered hub protein present in at least one of the two functional forms; the one functional form defines the ability of the disordered binding site to interact with specific partner and, upon interaction, to adopt an ordered conformation, another functional form is a flexible linker that connects two ordered domain and allows their unrestricted movement.47\n",

The degree of hydration is significantly higher for the IDPs in comparison to the similar size globular proteins. Furthermore, the hydration degree also varies for the partially and fully intrinsically disordered proteins.77, 78, 79 In addition to retaining a high amount of water content, IDPs also possess a high propensity of binding to charged solute ions. Both properties play an important protective role in biological systems. For example, under the adverse water-stressed conditions, D. radioduran is able to protect its enzyme nudix hydrolase from denaturation due to the aforementioned properties of the IDRs of this protein.80 Several plants and free-living insect species also protect themselves by using the ability of IDPs and IDRs for excessive hydration and absorption of solute ion.46\n",

MoRFs are intrinsically disordered protein segments, which are short and interaction-prone. These regions also have intrinsic propensity for order, which is not strong enough to ensure their folding in the unbound state. However, upon binding to specific partners, MoRFs undergo disorder-to-order transition. Such regions are chiefly involved in molecular recognition. The classification of MoRFs is based on their structures in the bound state. As a result, they are classified into \u03b1-helix-forming \u03b1-MoRFs, \u03b2-strand forming \u03b2-MoRFs, ordered regions without any regular structure or irregular \u03b9-MoRFs, and complex MoRF that contain two or more types of secondary structure.85, 86 In addition to MoRFs, other known binding modes are Pullers,87 Penetrators,88 Flexible Wrapper,89, 90, 91, 92 Connectors and Armature,93, 94, 95, 96, 97 Huggers,98, 99, 100 Stackers or \u03b2-Arcs,101 Intertwined Strings,102, 103, 104 Long Cylindrical Containers,105 Tweezers and a Forceps,106 Grabbers,107 Tentacles,108 and Chameleons.16, 109, 110, 111, 112\n",

Few examples are given here to illustrate the type of biological activities carried by the IDPs/IDRs. (1) IDPs contain sites for various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, methylation, glycosylation, ADP-ribosylation or acetylation; (2) Entropic spring (rubber-like) property can be provided by IDRs; (3) IDPs contain autoinhibitory domains; (4) IDPs/IDRs possess binding sites for DNA, rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, metal ions, and other proteins; (5) IDRs include regulatory protease digestion site; (6) Signal for the nuclear localization is located within IDRs; (7) IDRs provide flexible linkers between structured domains112; and (8) IDPs, such as p21 and p27, mediate cell regulation.113\nFig. 1\nprovides details of the involvement of IDPs in crucial cellular functions and processes.",

As of 2009, more than 50 predictors for intrinsic disorder prediction have been developed and published,116 and currently, this list is likely to be doubled. There are the good chances for the development of improved predictors for intrinsic disorder, if the proper sequence information is encoded into the prediction algorithm.

Some of these techniques provide outputs in an indirect way, while others are useful in providing more quantitative structural data. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is one of the most powerful techniques for deriving quantitative structural information.124 A wide line NMR relaxation experiment characterizes the IDPs and provides details about the presence of the hydrated layer in the vicinity of disordered regions in the extended and open state. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient of protein can be measured by the pulse field gradient NMR, from which the hydrodynamic parameters could be derived.4 Structural transition in IDPs can be mapped and documented by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The introduction of new generation spin-labels EPR that target the residues other than the cysteine expanded the approach of this technique.125, 126, 127, 128, 129 Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), which are the experimental techniques for the extraction of quantitative information, lead to an investigation of transient intermediates and provide detailed information about the nature of IDPs. The techniques of a single-molecule approach such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET),130, 131, 132 High-Speed Atomic Force Microscope (HS-AFM),133, 134 and AFM-based force spectroscopy (FS)135 are the tools to explore the dynamics and structure of IDPs. The change in distance between two residues and study of conformational equilibria in time length of less than a second based on the intramolecular distance distribution is done by the Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (SM-FRET). Formation of secondary structures and probing of time scales from milliseconds to seconds is particularly sensed by AFM-based SM-FS. HS-AFM is used for the direct observation of dynamic processes and structural dynamics of biological molecules, with the temporal resolution of subsecond to sub-100 ms.134, 136 To date, the various dynamic processes have been visualized successfully by using this approach. HS-AFM is applicable to both IDPs and well-structured protein.",

In the SDS-PAGE analysis, the observed mobility of IDPs appears to be anomalous. This phenomenon is explained by the less efficient binding of SDS molecules to highly charged IDPs in comparison to the globular proteins of similar molecular masses. The apparent molecular mass determine by this method is up to 1.2- to 1.8-fold higher than the molecular mass determined from the protein sequences or by mass spectrometry.137 The unusually high apparent molecular mass of IDPs is also observed by gel filtration or size exclusion chromatography techniques.123 The specific behavior of IDPs in different sets of environmental conditions, such as their stability in an acidic environment and insensitivity to high temperature, has been described for several IDPs, such as caldesmon,138 microtubule-associated protein-2 MAP2,139 involucrin,140 and \u03b1-synuclein6 to name a few. These environmental conditions usually cause the denaturation or/and precipitation of globular proteins out of solution. This difference in the behavior of IDPs and globular protein in the various sets of environmental condition form the basis of purification of IDPs.141, 142, 143, 144 This uniqueness of IDPs provides the first clue of their unusual structural conformation.145\n",

This provides viral proteins with the capability for quick adaption in the changing environment, survival in host body environments, and invasion of the defense mechanism of the host. To accomplish aforementioned tasks, a high mutation rate is exhibited by the viral genomes. For example, the rate of nucleotide exchange per position per generation exhibited by ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses fall in the range of 10\u2212 5 to 10\u2212 3, for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses it is 10\u2212 8 to 10\u2212 5, while eukaryotes and bacteria demonstrate mutation rate of 10\u2212 9.147 Even a single mutation has high potency to affect more than one viral protein, due to high compactness of viral genomes and the existence of the overlapping reading frames, which often is observed in the viral system. Throughout the life cycle of the virus, many interactions are made to various components of the host cell. It begins with the attachment, entry, and proceeding for the hijacking of the cellular machinery and further viral components synthesis, viral particle assembly, and end by exiting the host cell in the form of new infectious particles.148 And all these stages are heavily relying on the intrinsic disorder of viral proteins.148\n",

The presence of intrinsic disorder in viral proteins is advantageous for their interactions with the host cell components. The easiness of said interactions could be explained on the basis of the lack of rigid 3D structure and the presence of high structural flexibility in these viral IDPs or proteins containing IDRs to allow their interaction with many binding partners at a time. Linking of functional domains and their promiscuity is achieved by interaction with partner IDRs, where the flexibility plays a major role in bringing two or more domains in proximity in order to perform a particular function. Flexible linker functions of IDRs in viral protein confer the advantage of escaping the recognition by the host immune system; the viral protein interacts with host protein in such a way that the recognition of viral epitope becomes difficult to be recognized by the components of the host immune system. A mutation rate that is typically high in the viral system could be tolerated by the presence of these flexible regions in viral proteins that forbid the structural constraints, hence avoid the susceptibility to mutation. The expected explanation behind all these incidents points toward the involvement of IDPs. The first and pivotal observation of an abundance of intrinsic disorder in the replicative complex of paramyxoviruses had been confirmed.157, 158, 159 Availability and use of bioinformatics tools in the last decades and their continuous growth and the development of sensitive biophysical experimental techniques lead to the identification of an abundance of IDPs in Viruses.31, 160, 161, 162, 163\n",

However, they display various shapes and strictly do not possess a unique common morphology. The genome of all viruses either made up of double or single-stranded DNA or RNA. It is encapsulated within a protective protein coat known as the capsid. An additional lipid envelope contains a number of membrane proteins found in Enveloped viruses. The position of the envelope is above the matrix protein, which is an additional proteinaceous coat. Some complex viruses in addition to the non-structural proteins contain numerous accessory and regulatory proteins all that help in the assembly of the viral capsid. Viruses in reference to the structure of their genome, mechanism of replication, and transcription display a wide array of diversity. The viral genome could be of single or double-stranded DNA or single or double-stranded RNA and transcribed via a negative sense, positive sense, or ambisense mechanism. The diversity of the viruses either in genomic structure or mechanism of function leads to their classification in seven major classes.174 Following this classification, all DNA based viruses kept in class I, II, and VII that contain dsDNA viruses, ssDNA viruses and dsDNA viruses that replicate via an intermediate single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) respectively. The remaining four classes, that is III, IV, V and VI, contain various RNA viruses, such as double-stranded RNA viruses (dsRNA), ssRNA viruses of positive (+) sense, ssRNA virus of negative (\u2212) sense, and ssRNA virus of positive (+) sense that replicate via DNA intermediate, respectively. The certain features of viruses that typically oppose them to the living organisms are the absence of cell-like defined structure and inability of maintaining homeostasis and reproduce outside of the cellular environment due to the absence of their own metabolism and essential dependence on the host cell to make new products. The other features, such as the presence of a genome, replication ability and self-assembling creation of their own copies, and continuous evolution by natural selection make viruses similar to other living organisms.175\n",

Since their emergence, viruses have a dependency on cellular life. The second hypothesis is known as the cellular origin hypothesis or the vagrancy. According to this hypothesis it is assumed that the evolution of viruses occurs from the DNA or RNA pieces that escaped from the genes of the larger organisms. Examples of potential candidates for this escaped genetic material are (1) physically separated chromosomal DNA that is naked and can replicate independently called plasmid, (2) DNA pieces that have the ability to move from one place to other within the gene and replicate, termed transposon. Last, the third hypothesis of virus origin is a regressive or degeneracy hypothesis that proposes the origin of viruses take place from a parasitic cell that sheds all genes that were not required for the support of parasitism. The root of viral origin also traced from the nucleoprotein world that transiently existed during the transition of the RNA world to the modern DNA-RNA-Protein world according to different hypotheses. The appearance of RNA viruses took place either due to reduction or escape from the RNA containing primitive cells. These RNA viruses are also considered as the evolutionary starting point for some of the DNA viruses.178 The origin of viruses considered to be in the early phase of the evolution of life,179 when the living cells first evolved. Since then the existence of viruses has been proposed. This could be a reason why viruses have the ability to affect the cells from all three kingdoms of life that are Eukarya, Archaea, and Bacteria. The primitive viruses and their quick evolution propose a possible explanation for the lack of homology among the major viral proteins and proteins of cellular organisms.178\n",

Protein monomeric subunits termed as capsomers or protomers combine together to build the shell structure of the capsid. A tight association of RNA or DNA based genome to capsid protein results in the formation of a nucleoprotein complex. Nucleoprotein complex of viruses has the capability to interact with both nucleic acids and proteins, thereby possessing multifunctionality. Capsid structure is determined by the arrangement of capsomers. On this basis capsid could be of helical, icosahedral, or complex in shape. Highly ordered helical structure is a property of the capsids of helical, rod-shaped and filamentous viruses that are generally formed around a central axis with a single type of capsomer packaging. The genetic material of viruses made of RNA or DNA occupies the central cavity of the capsid, the positive charge of capsid protein and negative charge of viral genome maintain an electrostatic interaction between them. There is a variation in the size of helical viruses, which could be very long and flexible or very short and rigid. Capsid length of the helical viruses is defined by their genome size, whereas their diameter is defined by the size and arrangement of capsomers. Well-known illustrative examples among filamentous viruses are Sulfolobus islandicus filamentous virus (SIFV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Acidianus filamentous virus 1 (AFV1), and bacteriophage fd. In icosahedral viruses, the capsids are either icosahedral or nearly spherical with icosahedral symmetry. Although the number of capsomers required in the formation of such an icosahedral structure theoretically is calculated to be 60, in reality, in the majority of icosahedral viruses it is above the 60.148\n",

The exposure of viral content to host cytoplasm requires hydrogen ion to lower the pH. At lower pH, M1 dissociate from the ribonucleoprotein and initiate viral uncoating. The supply of hydrogen ion into the viral particle from endosomes is mediated through the integral homotetrameric membrane protein (M2 proton channel), situated in the viral envelope. This ion channel is proton-selective and is gated by low pH conditions.185 In enveloped viruses, the viral envelope is attached to their core via matrix proteins. Matrix protein plays their role once the virus enters into the host cell. In addition to expelling the genetic material from the viral core, matrix proteins have various regulatory roles via interacting with host components.

HPV open reading frames (ORFs) are classified in early (E) and late (L) types on the basis of location within the viral genome. HPV early ORFs code for non-structural proteins. Both E1 and E2 proteins participate in viral replication and regulation of transcription at an early stage. E1 binds to the origin of replication and unveil helicase and ATPase activity,188, 189 while E2 facilitates E1 binding to the origin of replication by forming the complex with it.189, 190, 191 E2 also plays a role of a transcription factor by regulating (both positively and negatively) early gene expression by attaching to the specific recognition sites within the upstream regulatory region (URR).192, 193 A differentiation-dependent productive phase of the viral life cycle is promoted by the highly expressed protein E4 that is involved in a number of important functions.194, 195, 196 In vitro studies found that E5 has weak transforming capabilities.197, 198 It disrupts the MHC class II maturation199 and is involved in the HPV late functions.200, 201 E6 and E7 proteins are primarily involved in the progression of HPV-mediated malignant cells that ultimately cause invasive carcinoma. Their role in high-risk HPVs is to act as partial oncoproteins at least by targeting the cell cycle regulator/tumor suppressor p53 and Rb.

The non-structural protein NS1 of West Nile virus (WNV) has displayed is presence in the immunomodulation, as concluded by experimental finding that both cell-surface associated, as well as soluble NS1 was able to bind and recruit the complement regulatory protein factor H. Due to this activity, there is a decrease in the complement activation that minimizes the targeting of WNV by immune system via decrease in the infected cells complement recognition.203 The immune modulation role is also exhibited by rinderpest virus non-structural C protein, but via a different mechanism. In rinderpest virus action of type 1 and type 2, interferons, which are responsible for the induction of innate immune response, are specifically blocked by non-structural C protein.204 It has been determined that many non-structural V proteins of paramyxovirus have shown their roles in countering the response of antivirals.205 At last, gene transactivation may require viral non-structural proteins. For instance, the autonomous parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM) non-structural protein NS1 is required the activation of p39 promoter that controls the transcription of a gene that encodes capsid protein. Gene that code for NS-1 also codes NS-2 due to overlapping transcription unit in MVM virus. This gene is transcribed by a P04 promoter.206\n",

For instance, the replication of HIV-1 is actively controlled by the production of several accessory (Nef, Vpu, Vif, and Vpr) and two regulatory proteins (Rev and Tat). These regulatory and accessory proteins control the various aspects of the viral life cycle, in addition to regulating the host cell functions, such as gene regulation and apoptosis.207 A number of accessory proteins are, in fact, responsible for in vivo infection.

Bacterial proteomes have a number of proteins in the range of 500\u20138000, with only a small portion of bacterial species having proteome size less than 1500 proteins. The archaeal proteomes are condensed to the much narrow range of 1500\u20133000 proteins. Proteomes of viruses are very compact, being limited to less than 1000 proteins. Log-based plot analysis (Fig. 1B of 31) determines that the only one polyprotein is possessed by the greater than 200 viruses and the number of viruses whose genome encode proteins between 15 and 30 is limited in comparison to the viruses with other sizes of the proteome.31 So far, nine large mimiviruses are known, each containing more than 500 proteins. The size of the proteome of these mimiviruses is so large, that we can say that it is of nearly equal size to the proteome size of some small bacteria. Therefore, the continuous spectrum of a size of proteome arrange in the order of viruses to archaea, to unicellular eukaryotes and lastly to multicellular eukaryotes. The proteome of bacterial species overlapped with the proteome of viruses, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes.31\n",

            "text": "Based on the estimated disordered content in Archaea, this kingdom can be split into three classes. Class one consists of the organism whose proteomic disordered content range from 12% to 21%, and 61 organisms such have been analyzed. Class two consists of 4 organisms whose disordered content varies from 21% to 32%. The last class has the 8 organisms with the estimated variation in their disordered content being reported to range from 32% to 38%. The comparatively higher percentage of disorder in the class three species is attributed to the peculiarities of their habitats. As confirmed by the studies, the high disordered bearing archaeal species are halophiles and methanophiles.29 Generally, the global disorder predictors are developed on the basis of the training set of non-halophilic proteins under the normal physiological conditions of 100\u2013150 mM NaCl. The accuracy of determined IDRs for the proteins of the extremophilic microorganisms surviving under the hypersaline conditions with the help of such predictors might vary. Actually, since halophilic microorganisms are the salt-loving extremophilic organism, their optimum growth occurs in the salt-rich environment. A strategy used by these microorganisms to maintain an appropriate osmotic environment in their cytoplasm is \u201csalting- in\u201d. Through this, they accumulate molar concentration of chloride and potassium.221 Extensive adaptation in the intracellular proteins is required for this strategy to tackle the presence of excessive salt concentration, as at near saturating salt concentration they should maintain proper conformation and activity. The proteomes of these \u201csalting-in\u201d organisms are highly acidic in nature and corresponding proteins possess remarkable structural instability in low salt conditions, while possessing soluble and active conformations in a hypersaline (Salt rich) condition that are usually detrimental to proteins of non-halophilic organisms. Furthermore, a salt-rich environment determines the structure to function capability. In similarity to their physiological environment, excessive salts and water bind to proteins of these organisms in solvent conditions that depend upon the acidic amino acid residues present on the protein surface.222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230 Considering the aforementioned reasons, it could be suggested that prediction of high disorder in these organisms may simply represents prediction error.31\n",

            "text": "The analyzed disorder levels among non-viral proteomes revealed that unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes generally have the highest amount of IDPs/IDRs in their proteomes. Comparative fractional analysis of disorder for them range between 35% and 45%. However, a group of unicellular eukaryotes has levels of disordered residues in the range of 45\u201350%. The organisms included in this group are Cryptococcus neoformans (CRYNE, DISORDER%, 47.1), Neurospora crassa (NEUCR, DISORDER%, 48.2), Plasmodium falciparum (PLAF7, DISORDER%, 49.5), Plasmodium yoelii (PLAYO, 46.0%), and Ustilago maydis (USTMA, 49.9%). The observed high variability and high levels of predicted disorder are in line with the earlier study that revealed enrichment of predicted disorder in early-branching protein, while comparing it to typical eukaryotic proteins structure submitted in Swiss-Prot database and ordered proteins from PDB.231 As much as twice the fraction of IDRs with \u2265 30 disordered residues is found in some protozoa, in comparison to Swiss-Prot database-based representative set of proteins. If it will be compared with similar regions from a PDB select 25 set of proteins, it would be sevenfold increase.231 It is noteworthy that more disordered proteins were found in parasitic protozoa than in non-parasitic protists.231 For instance, 35% proteins encoded by genes present on the chromosomes 2 and 3 of P. falciparum were predicted to contain long IDRs (i.e., longer than 40 residues).24 Although more recent study revealed that the data on the amount of disorder in P. falciparum was underestimated, proposing that 52\u201367% proteins of this organism contain long disorder regions.232 The latest study examines the prevalence of disorder in the proteome of many apicomplexan parasites, the obtained result demonstrated that the primate malaria parasite (P. knowlesi) and human malaria parasites (P. falciparum and P. vivax) contain more disordered regions in comparison to rodent malaria parasite.25 Additionally, more disorder was reported in the proteins expressed at a sporozite stage of P. falciparum in comparison to those expressed in the other stages of their life cycle.25 It has been proposed that a high abundance of disorder in the proteome of this unicellular organism is related to its adaptation to changing environment during its whole life-cycle, as it is able to affect many different hosts.231 In simple words, we may say that the abundance of intrinsic disorder in the apicomplexan parasite evolves as a way to adopt a parasitic life style.231 Overall observance of various proteomes of different life forms and their disorder contents revealed that with the increase in the proteome size, the lower bound fractions of disordered content appear to increase continuously, whereas the upper bound fractions of disordered residues decrease in viruses and increase among the bacteria, archaea, and eukaryote. Therefore, the species whose proteome size falls between 1000 and 2000 proteins have the least variance of the fraction of disordered residues. Nevertheless, if the variance of a fraction of disordered residues is measured by different domains of life, the largest variance comes to 70% and it would be for viruses, whereas for multicellular eukaryotes variance comes to 12% which is smallest.31\n",

Few species of viruses are highly rich in disordered residues. There are 20 small viruses that encode \u2264 5 proteins in their proteomes and that have disorder content 50% or greater. In viruses, it appears that with increasing proteome size, the disorder content converges in the range of 20\u201340%. The prediction of the high content of intrinsically disordered residues in viruses found to be in great agreement with a study showing that many proteins of bacteriophage, viruses, bacteria, and archaea are significantly depleted in the hydrophobic residues and enriched in polar (hydrophilic) residues in their sequences.210 A portion of IDRs in viruses is likely to evolve to support their ability to deal with their hostile habitat, in addition to be profoundly involved in functioning of their proteins. Still, other IDRs have evolved to deal with the alternative splicing, antisense transcription, and gene overlapping in a way that makes more efficient use of genetic material.162 Polar residues have the ability of specific recognition and could establish a strong hydrogen bond with partner molecules contrary to the non-specific hydrophobic interactions. An increased amount of polar residues in viral proteins could be linked to increasing demand for disorder in the unbound state and specific recognition and stabilization inbound states.31, 210\n",

When a single IDR binds to many partners, then it converts themselves in many different structural forms.110 IDPs demonstrate different interaction modes, either being able to form a very stable complex structure or transiting between the interacting partner as dynamic bound and unbound state acting as an on-off switch in signaling pathways.11 Depending upon the surrounding environment, IDPs adopt different conformations and functions accordingly. Binding promiscuity is an important characteristic and required feature of the for viral proteomes, since despite encoding many proteins, viruses explicitly require host cell machinery to complete their life cycle, and in doing so, binding promiscuity is helping them to fulfill this role. The binding promiscuity and interaction types have well explained in the earlier paragraphs of this chapter. The compact genomes of viruses restrict them to encoding fewer proteins, but the presence of IDRs or global disorder allowed proteins to be involved in different tasks by interacting with various partners. With a few given examples, it would be easy to understand how the binding promiscuity of viruses is related to their intrinsic disorder. The replication of the RNA genome of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) requires the translation of a single basic protein known as the delta antigen (\u03b4Ag). \u03b4Ag is a small protein containing 195 amino acid residues and has no known enzymatic activity, although being essential for the replication of viral genome.247 Experimental CD measurement and computational research via disordered protein meta-predictors have proven this protein to be an IDP.248 Completion of the HDV replication cycle of the depends on this protein and various components of the host cell. Therefore, it is easy to understand the importance of binding promiscuity of \u03b4Ag, that interact with multiple components in the host cell for various reasons and through a different approach, although the exact purpose of these interactions is still unclear and studied widely.249, 250 In an in vitro analysis, it was found that \u03b4Ag binds to RNAs and even dsDNA in addition to binding to HDV RNAs that shows a lack of specificity in \u03b4Ag protein.248\n",

Economic usage of the genetic material of HTLV-1 is due to the wide accumulation of intrinsically disordered proteins in its proteome. This is paralleled to the occurrences of intrinsic disorder in HIV-1 protein, where intrinsic disorder was observed in post-translational cleavage sites leading to the production of Gag, Pro and Pol from Gag-pro and Gag-pro-pol grand polyproteins and cleavage sites of polyproteins that yield MA, NC, CA, RT, TM, IN, and SU proteins.148\n",

            "text": "Paramyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae are the members of the mononegavirales order consisting of viruses with non-segmented ssRNA genome of negative polarity.289 In mononegavirales, genome is tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein within a helical nucleocapsid. The viral nucleocapsid serves as a substrate for both replication and transcription. Both replication and transcription are performed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) that consists of complex formed between the viral large protein (L) and phosphoprotein (P). P protein acts as an essential polymerase cofactor and recruits the L-protein onto the nucleocapsid template. Beyond its role as a polymerase cofactor, it also acts as chaperone for the N-protein in a way that it prevents their illegitimate self-assembly when genomic RNA synthesis does not occur and maintain them in a soluble form (N\u00b0) within a complex (N\u00b0\u2212P) and used for the encapsidation of Nascent RNA chain during replication.290 The significant functional importance of N and P protein appears due to their involvement in numerous protein-protein interactions within the internal (viral) and external (Host) PPI networks. Multiple biological functions occur due to this interactability. Including modulation of both acquired and innate immunity. Experiments have proven the abundance of disorder in the N and P protein of these viruses. The persistence of disorder in the C-terminal domain of nucleoprotein (NTAIL), even after complex formation, indicates potential role of this region in binding,259, 291, 292 as described in case of MeV NTAIL, whose first 20 amino acids interacts with cellular nucleoprotein receptor293, 294 and C-terminal region interact with the major inducible heat shock protein Hsp 70 that leads to both viral replication and transcription.295 The disordered nature of NTAIL in measles and Hendra viruses has also confirmed in the context of full-length N protein that formed Nucleocapsid like particle (NLP) when expressed in the heterologous system.296, 297, 298 Initially, it was thought that the C-terminal X domain (XD) of the phosphoprotein triggers major conformational rearrangement within nucleocapsid, and this leads to the access of the viral polymerase to RNA genome.259, 292, 299 However recent NMR studies rule out these possibilities and provide the first direct observation of the interaction between XD and intact nucleocapsid in the Paramyxoviridae. The disordered NTAIL region is partially exposed at the surface of the nucleocapsid and provides a way for interaction with numerous protein partners. Indeed, MeV NTAIL interacts with various viral protein partners, such as P, P-L complex, and matrix protein.300 Besides interaction with viral components, it also interacts with host cellular components, such as Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3),301 hsp70,295 peroxiredoxin 1,302 casein kinase II,303 the cell protein responsible for the nuclear export of N,304 and possibly the components of the cell cytoskeleton.305, 306 Additionally, the NTAIL of MeV nucleocapsid released from infected cells binds to the cell receptors involved in MeV-induced immunosuppression.293, 294 The P protein disorder was reported in both Paramyxoviridae157, 158, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311 and Rhabdoviridae.312, 313, 314 P protein in the members of these families possesses a very high modular organization that consists of alternate ordered and disordered regions. In Paramyxoviridae, P protein possesses a large disordered region (4000 residues) at its N terminal (PNT) domain. Several interactions made by the PNT domain of MeV and Sendai virus (SeV) have been reported, such as the PNT domain of MeV interactions with N and cellular protein,315, 316 SeV interacts with an unassembled form of N (N\u00b0) and L protein.317, 318 While the C-terminus nucleocapsid binding region of P adopts compact folded stable conformations in members of Rhabdoviridae and majority of Paramyxovirinae, it remains disordered in the respiratory syncytial virus which is a member of Pneumovirinae subfamily.311, 319 The N-terminal region of P protein from Rhabdoviridae and Paramyxoviridae that is involved in binding to N\u00b0 has been reported to contain the \u03b1-MoRF.158, 312, 313, 320 This induced folding upon the binding effect in a form of the \u03b1-MoRF is limited to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus. The structure of VSV N\u00b0\u2212P complex was solved and verified that although the binding region adopts an \u03b1-helical configuration, the flanking regions remain flexible. P protein \u03b1-MoRF binding occurs at the same site that is responsible for RNA and different N protein binding, thereby preventing the polymerization of N protein. These results provide a link between different processes and possibly explain the mechanism of initiation for viral RNA synthesis.321 In MeV, limited proteolysis study carried out in secondary structure stabilizer (TFE) provided evidence for the disorder to order transition of disordered N-terminal region of P (PNT).157 The presence of disordered domains in both P and N proteins leads to the controlled dynamic interactions in a coordinated manner between template nucleocapsid surface and polymerase complex that could extend further over the successive turns of the helix. The long disordered regions in viral proteins enable them to act as a potential linker between the binding partner and participate in large macromolecular assembly acting as a scaffolding engine.322, 323\n",

The core protein is released from the rest of the poly-protein to initiate the functions required for further maturation and multiplication of viruses. RNA chaperoning activity of core protein is confirmed in in vitro assays, additionally it is responsible for packaging and condensation of viral genomic RNA during viral morphogenesis. Core protein mediates several interactions with host proteins for viral persistence and pathogenicity and simultaneously involves itself in functions related to viral replication.327 Biophysical and biochemical studied done so far on the Flaviviridae family confirmed the widespread use of core protein IDRs in its member viruses despite having the low sequence similarity and other pronounced differences in their modular organization.148\n",

The ZIKV capsid major functions are nucleocapsid assembly and involvement in the viral infection processes by interacting with cellular proteins, modulating cellular metabolism, apoptosis, and immune response.329 Major functions of the Capsid protein of DENV are RNA binding and RNA chaperone activity, nucleocapsid assembly, lipid droplet accumulation and interaction with host components.330 Despite major knowledge on the functions and disorder status of capsid proteins of DENV and ZIKV, the exact mechanism of IDR-mediated control of various functions of this protein is yet to be discovered.

However, the exact mechanism of binding of N protein to genomic RNA is not completely understood. Two domains present in N protein NTD and CTD are flanked by long stretches of disordered regions that counts for almost half of the entire length. Both domains through their flanking disordered regions bind to RNA. Although low sequence homology reported in different coronavirus N protein through bioinformatics study, flexible linker region of N protein of all coronaviruses started with SR-rich region and end with region enriched with basic residues. These features are the hallmarks of the protein disorder. The overall isoelectric point (pI) of these flexible linkers is high, which is self-explanatory for their RNA binding abilities. The aforementioned findings suggest that the physiochemical features are likely to be conserved across different groups of Coronaviridae.

D1 is highly conserved and is less disordered, while D2 and D3 are less conserved and are highly disordered.252, 253, 254, 349 High disorder content defines the dynamic behavior of D2 and D3 that makes them a hub-like a center for multiple interactions. NS5A-D2 is important for NS5A function and is involved in molecular interaction with RDRP (NS5B) and PKR. The interaction established by NS5A-D2 interferes with host signaling pathways and apoptosis.256 Although NS5A-D3 is mostly disordered, it contains short ordered elements at its N-terminus. In a recent study, NS5A-D3 proteins from two HCV strains were found to exhibit a propensity to partial folding into an \u03b1-helix.350 NMR analysis revealed two putative \u03b1-helices for that a molecular model could be proposed. The first \u03b1-helix conservation in all genotypes and its amphipathic character suggest that it could be corresponding to MoRE and hence promote the interaction with a suitable biological partner(s). One such partner is Cyclophilin A (CypA). Cyclophilins are cell factors crucial in HCV replication. Interestingly, Cyclosporin completely abrogates the interaction between HCV NS5A-D3 and CypA. CypA together with NS5A and NS5B forms the crucial component of multi-protein complex and supports RNA transcription and replication.350\n",

            "text": "The large family of papillomavirus (PV) includes small DNA viruses infecting mammals, reptile, and birds. At least 100 different types of HPV are reported to date that act as a cofactor in the development of carcinoma of head, neck, genital tract and epidermis and also cause the papillomas and benign wart. HPV classified into two classes on the basis of its association with cancer. The first category includes low-risk viruses (HPV-6, HPV-11), and the second category contains high-risk viruses (HPV-16, HPV-18, and HPV-45) types. Similar to all DNA tumor viruses, HPV hijacks the replication machinery and forces the infected cell to enter into the S phase of the cell cycle. The transforming activity of high-risk HPVs is mainly exerted through their E7, which is one of their two oncoproteins. E7 is responsible for pathogenesis and maintenance of human cervical cancer and has been determined to participate in numerous cellular processes including DNA synthesis, transcription, transformation, cell growth, and apoptosis.358 E7 interacts with Rb, which is a tumor suppressor protein, and interferes with its tumor suppression activity. Rb acts as guardian of the cell cycle due to its involvement into the control of G1/S transition.359 Therefore, Rb is critical for determining the progression of the cell into the normal phase or transformation. Besides interacting with proteins of Rb family, E7 also interacts with histone deacetylase,360 kinase p33CDK2 and cyclin A,361 protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A),362 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip1 protein.363 PP2A is sequestered and excluded from its interaction with protein kinase B (PKB) or Akt due to its involvement in the formation of a complex with E7.364 PKB is one of several second messenger kinases that is activated via cell attachment and growth factor signaling and that sends a signal to the cell nucleus to prevent apoptosis, thus leading the way toward cell survival during proliferation. The interaction between PP2A and E7 leads to the inhibition of PKB/Akt dephosphorylation that keeps the PKB/Akt signaling activated. E7 protein broad range molecular interactions depend on the flexible disordered region present within the E7. Previous studies performed on recombinant E7 reveal that its structure can be described as the elongated dimer that changes conformation upon a small change in pH, while gaining \u03b1-helicity by exposure to solvents.365 Biophysical characterization of E7 from HPV-45 with far-UV CD and NMR revealed that its N-terminal region (E7N, amino acids 1\u201340) is disordered, while its C-terminal domain is well structured (41\u201398) with a unique zinc-binding fold. The Intrinsically unstructured N-terminal region of E7 contains binding and Casein kinase II phosphorylation sites.292, 366, 367 The CD spectra recorded for the different conformations as a function of temperature and pH indicated a polyproline II-like structure.366 The structural stability is maintained by phosphorylation that results in increased transformation activity in the cell. Transforming protein E6 and E7 of high-risk HPVs incorporate high amounts of intrinsic disorder.368\n",

It also discusses some details of the intrinsic disorder perspective of viruses, the role of IDPs and IDRs in the virus-facilitated host mechanisms, prevalence of the intrinsic disorder in viral proteomes, and functional prominence of disordered viral proteins. The role of IDRs in various structural and non-structural proteins of viruses, such as capsid, nucleocapsid, genome-linked surface glycoproteins, matrix and accessory, and regulatory proteins have been summarized. IDPs/IDRs role in specific function-oriented proteins in different viruses have been elaborated, such as membrane-binding protein \u03bbN of bacteriophage, hordeivirus movement protein TGBp1, influenza virus non-structural protein 2, bBasic protein \u03b4Ag of HDV, and Human adenovirus type 5 early transcription unit 1B. Also, the importance of intrinsic disorder for the alternative splicing and overlapping reading frames of viral proteome is discussed. Viruses mainly cause pathogenesis by hijacking the cell machinery and modulating its functions, e.g., by altering IDP components involved in the host cell cycle control mechanism. Viral IDPs mediate successful infection and regulate pathogenesis at multiple levels. Therefore, the knowledge of intrinsic disorder and structural flexibility in processes of virus-host interaction and associated functions is crucial for better understanding of viral pathogenesis. The involvement of IDPs/IDRs in the mechanism of viral infection is not completely understood. Therefore, this chapter would allow readers to get better understanding of the importance of IDPs/IDRs in various functional mechanisms/viral components, which are essential for the completion of crucial phases of the viral life cycle. Finally, the IDPs/IDPRs of viruses are considered as potential drug targets, due to their high prevalence in viral proteomes and ubiquitous involvement in host-pathogen mediated regulations. In conclusion, the involvement of IDPs in viral pathogenesis should be solemnly considered for unlocking the complex riddles of viral infection and associated patterns, their cellular control, and exploitation strategies, and drug development approach in near future by targeting their disordered regions.",
