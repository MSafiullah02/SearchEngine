            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) is classified in the genus Circovirus of the family Circoviridae (Todd et al., 2005). Two genotypes of PCV have been identified. PCV type 1 (PCV1), which was first recognized in 1974 as a contaminant of a continuous porcine kidney cell line (PK15) (Tischer et al., 1982), is known to be non-pathogenic to pigs (Allan et al., 1995). Infection with PCV type 2 (PCV2) has been associated with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in young weaned pigs, which was first recognized in Canada in 1991 (Clark, 1997). Nowadays, this disease and related PCV2-associated diseases are occurring in all swine-producing areas of the world and have become increasingly serious threats to global pig production (Allan et al., 1998, Allan and Ellis, 2000, Choi et al., 2000, Edwards and Sands, 1994, Fenaux et al., 2000, Mankertz et al., 2000, Onuki et al., 1999, Segal\u00e9s and Domingo, 2002). Usually PMWS appears in pigs aged 5 to 18 weeks, and affected pigs show fever, wasting or unthriftiness, respiratory distress, enlarged lymph nodes and, occasionally, jaundice and diarrhea (Darwich et al., 2004, Harding, 1996, Segal\u00e9s and Domingo, 2002). Mortality rates may vary from 1 to 2% up to 30% in complicated cases when co-infections with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine parvovirus, or Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Other risk factors described in the Madec principles have been developed to correlate with PMWS (Rose et al., 2003). Microscopic lesions are characterized by lymphocyte depletion of follicular and interfollicular areas together with macrophage infiltration of lymphoid tissues in PMWS-affected pigs. Several lines of field and experimental evidence have suggested that severely PMWS affected pigs may develop immunosuppression (Segal\u00e9s et al., 2004).",

Two major open reading frames (ORFs) have been recognized for PCV, ORF1, called rep gene, which encodes a protein of 35.7 kDa involved in virus replication (Mankertz et al., 1998), and ORF2, called cap gene, which encodes the major immunogenic capsid protein of 27.8 kDa (Cheung, 2003, Nawagitgul et al., 2000). In addition, a third open reading frame (ORF3) coding for an apoptosis-associated protein has been reported for PCV2 and it is involved in viral pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo (Liu et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2006). A recent report has shown that PCV2 induces nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation in cultured cells, and further revealed the role of NF-\u03baB activation in viral replication and PCV2-mediated apoptotic change (Wei et al., 2008). However, whether the other signaling pathways may also contribute to PCV2 infection in the cultured cells is still unclear.",

            "text": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway is one of the three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades that play important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, cytokine production and apoptosis (Garrington and Johnson, 1999, Roux and Blenis, 2004). The ERK activation is initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases that signal through the small GTP-binding protein Ras. Activation of Ras leads to phosphorylation of Raf kinase and in turn phosphorylates MEK1/2 followed by activating ERK1/2 via phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues (Rubinfeld and Seger, 2005). The activated ERK1/2 translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates numerous downstream substrates such as transcription factors c-myc, Ets, Elk-1, and Egr-1, which ultimately regulate gene expression (Luttrell, 2003). Therefore, the ERK signaling pathway involves in a wide range of cellular functions including cell proliferation, transformatiom, differentiation, and cell survival and death (Sebolt-Leopold et al., 1999, Luttrell, 2003). Research data have shown that many viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (Johnson et al., 2001), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (Yang and Gabuzda, 1999), influenza virus (Pleschka et al., 2001), herpes virus (Perkins et al., 2002), coxsackievirus B3 (Luo et al., 2002), vaccinia virus (Andrade et al., 2004, de Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2001), respiratory syncytial virus (Kong et al., 2004), Borna disease virus (Planz et al., 2001), and coronavirus (Cai et al., 2007) manipulate the ERK signaling pathway to regulate viral replication and gene expression. However, the role of the ERK signaling pathway during PCV2 replication is not clear.",

Many viruses utilize the ERK pathway for maximal viral replication. Activated ERK1/2 was reported to enhance the infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), whereas treatment of cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor significantly inhibited HIV infectivity (Yang and Gabuzda, 1998, Yang and Gabuzda, 1999). ERK MAPK is required for Visna virus replication and virus-induced neuropathology (Barber et al., 2002). Treating cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor also significantly inhibited the propagation of influenza A virus (Pleschka et al., 2001), Borna disease virus (Planz et al., 2001), Coxsackievirus B3 (Luo et al., 2002), human cytomegalovirus (Johnson et al., 2001), vaccinia virus (Andrade et al., 2004), coronavirus (Cai et al., 2007), and astrovirus (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2008). In the present study, we determined whether PCV2-induced ERK1/2 activation is involved in viral replication by examining the effect of the inhibitor U0126 on PCV2 production and found that inhibition of ERK1/2 activation significantly reduced the production of progeny virus (Fig. 4). This shows that optimal PCV2 replication requires the ERK1/2 activity, and raises the possibility that PCV2 has acquired the ability to activate the kinase to aid its replication. Therefore, our findings indicate that PCV2-induced activation of ERK is truly involved in the replication of PCV2 in PK15 cells and add a new member to the growing list of viruses whose replication is modulated by the ERK signaling pathway.",

            "text": "ERK1/2 regulation of viral replication can act at specific steps of the replication cycle, such as attachment, entry, gene transcription, protein expression, and assembly. Borna disease virus requires active ERK for entry (Planz et al., 2001). HIV-1 depends on the activation of MEK ERK pathway to deliver its genomes into the cultured cells (Liu et al., 2002). Inhibition of ERK during coronavirus infection specifically decreases genomic and sgRNA production but has no effect on protein synthesis (Cai et al., 2007). ERK activates adenovirus gene transactivators, modulating protein expression (Sch\u00fcmann and Dobbelstein, 2006, Whalen et al., 1997), with little effect on RNA levels (Sch\u00fcmann and Dobbelstein, 2006). Inhibition of MEK/ERK pathway reduces Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infectivity but has no effect on virus binding to the cell surface receptor (Naranatt et al., 2003). Vaccinia virus-induced ERK activation was significantly blocked by inhibition of ERK, which was simultaneously paralleled by both delayed viral early-gene expression and a decrease in viral DNA synthesis (Andrade et al., 2004). Inhibition of ERK activation mediated by astrovirus reduces all steps of the viral life cycle, including early and late protein expression as well as subgenomic and genomic RNA transcription (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2008). The function of activated ERK during PCV2 infection was investigated in the present study. Our data showed that treatment of cells with U0126 suppressed virus propagation at the step of viral RNA transcription as well as viral protein synthesis. PCV replicates via rolling circle replication involving an intermediate double-stranded replicative form of DNA, and the rep proteins nick and join the nucleotide segments at the initiation and termination of the replication cycle (Cheung, 2006, Steinfeldt et al., 2006). Thus, it was not surprising that treatment of PCV2-infected cells with inhibition of ERK reduced viral transcripts as well as protein expression, because viral transcription and protein synthesis are closely related in the replication of PCV2. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the inhibition of ERK activation on PCV2 replication requires the identification of particular cellular factors which are the components of the ERK signaling pathway.",
