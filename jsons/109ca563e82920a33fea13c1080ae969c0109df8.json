Neutrophil-derived neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a pathogenic role in many thrombo-inflammatory states including sepsis 4, 5 , thrombosis [6] [7] [8] , and respiratory failure 9, 10 . NETs are extracellular webs of chromatin and microbicidal proteins that are an evolutionarily conserved aspect of innate immune host-defense 11 ; however, NETs also have potential to initiate and propagate inflammation and thrombosis 12, 13 . NETs deliver a variety of oxidant enzymes to the extracellular space, including myeloperoxidase, NADPH oxidase, and nitric oxide synthase 14 , while also serving as a source of extracellular histones that carry significant cytotoxic potential 15, 16 . NETs are drivers of cardiovascular disease by propagating inflammation in vessel walls 17 . Furthermore, when formed intravascularly, NETs can occlude arteries 18 , veins 19 , and microscopic vessels 20 . Early studies of COVID-19 suggest a high risk of morbid arterial events 21 , and the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increasingly revealing itself as more data become available 22 .",

We identified a fourth patient who developed VTE several weeks into his hospitalization. This 66-year-old man's course was complicated by respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation beginning on day 6. He received prophylactic-dose heparin throughout his hospitalization, but was nevertheless diagnosed on day 20 with extensive right-lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis. We were able to test serum from day 8 of his hospitalization for NET remnants ( Table 2) .

All tests were elevated in patients diagnosed with VTE, including as early as 12 days prior to detection of VTE in one case.

Citrullinated-histone H3 was quantified in sera using the Citrullinated Histone H3 (Clone 11D3) ELISA Kit (Cayman, 501620) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Quantification of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes. Myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes were quantified similarly to what has been previously described33 . This protocol used several reagents from the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche). First, a high-binding EIA/RIA 96-well plate (Costar) was coated overnight at 4\u00baC with anti-human myeloperoxidase antibody (Bio-Rad 0400-0002), diluted to a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/ml in coating buffer (Cell Death kit). The plate was washed two times with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), and then blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS (supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 hours at room temperature. The plate was again washed five times, before incubating for 90 minutes at room temperature with 10% serum or plasma in the aforementioned blocking buffer (without Tween 20). The plate was washed five times, and then incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature with 10x anti-DNA antibody (HRP-conjugated; from the Cell Death kit) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. After five more washes, the plate was developed with 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Invitrogen) followed by a 2N sulfuric acid stop solution. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek). Data were normalized to in vitro-prepared NET standards included on every plate, which were quantified based on their DNA content. Quantification of antiphospholipid antibodies. Antiphospholipid antibodies were quantified in sera using the Quanta Lite\u00ae ACA IgG, ACA IgM, ACA IgA, aPS/PT IgG, aPS/PT IgM Kits (Inova Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Manufacturer-recommended cut off was used to determine positive values. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
