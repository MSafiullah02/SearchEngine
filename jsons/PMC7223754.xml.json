            "text": "The idea to use phage as treatment option for bacterial infections came up immediately after the discovery of bacterial viruses (bacteriophage or phage) one century ago. As early as in the 1920s, an institute for bacteriophage was founded in Tbilisi, Georgia (former Soviet Union). In the following \u201cera of antibiotics\u201d, the potential significance of phage as therapeutics became underestimated. Under the pressure of global emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and supply shortages for certain antibiotics, the idea of phage therapy has been revitalized during the last years; many institutions and commercial companies are currently engaged in this field. There are case histories describing successful phage therapy of single patients; however, the number of controlled clinical studies, particularly those demonstrating efficacy to modern standards, is still limited. Besides the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, phage can be applied as biological control agents for pathogen detection and identification or for food and surface decontamination. Molecular engineering of phage or phage-derived enzymes could improve its practical use for these applications. Certainly, detection and treatment approaches of Category A priority pathogens will benefit from these developments. Figure 1 summarizes main targets for phage application studied currently.",

On reviewing medicinal literature and experts\u2019 opinion, Bassetti et al. stated that in the last decade, all attempts of infection prevention and control were unable to circumvent the rapid spread of resistant bacterial pathogens. The authors estimate that this antibiotic resistance crisis will cause worldwide 10 million deaths per annum in 2050 [1]. Therefore, the work on alternative strategies to reverse this trend and to provide a means to treat these pathogens is indispensable [2\u20136]. Phage therapy is one promising route.",

During the lytic way, phages use the cellular processes and resources to produce tens to hundreds of progeny phages, which exit the host cell with or without killing. During the lysogenic way, the phage integrates its genome into the bacterial chromosome and is replicated as part of it (in some cases the phage keeps an extrachromosomal form) [7]. Under certain intracellular and/or environmental conditions, this process is reversible and the phage genome can be excised and can switch back to the lytic cycle. These so-called temperate phages can decide in every infection cycle whether to replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host alive.",

From the beginning, he forced the use of phage for therapeutic measures to kill pathogenic bacteria. In the twenties and thirties of the twentieth century, when he helped to establish the bacteriophage institute in Tbilisi, Georgia, he even wrote a book \u201cBacteriophage and the phenomenon of recovery\u201d in Russian language [9]\u2014see Fig. 2. Since then, this institute is a leading institution in the production and use of therapeutic phage. However, it has been argued that only few systematic studies were performed in Tbilisi and the clinical trials did not comply with internationally approved standards. This appraisal might have not considered those facts as military secrecy in Soviet Union, loss of documentation, and language barriers. Therefore, the Tbilisi colleagues published conclusive overviews demonstrating the methods and results of their studies [8, 10, 11].",

However, antimicrobial activity of endolysins in vitro was reported to be dependent on multiple parameters such as pH range, buffer conditions, temperature, and ionic strength nicely reviewed by Oliveira et al. [72]. The authors emphasize that virion-associated lysins (VALs, see below) may have even greater therapeutic potential than endolysins because, as component on the surface of the virion, they have to maintain activity in different environmental conditions. Altogether, comparisons between phage and phage-derived enzymes should attract more attention. Probably, only the combination of different antimicrobial treatment options (including antibiotics) will increase the repertoire to combat multiresistant bacterial pathogens.

This effect can alter the composition and the balance of a microbiome and result in antibiotic-associated severe infections. To avoid negative side effects, the development of sequence-specific antimicrobials based on controllable CRISPR-Cas nucleases seems a valuable option. Bikard et al. selectively attacked virulence genes of Staphylococcus aureus by RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease and thereby killed the virulent, but not avirulent bacteria [87]. The efficiency of this method was confirmed in vivo in a mouse model. Citorek et al. used the same tool to induce cell death or plasmid loss upon detection of genetic signatures derived from virulence or antibiotic resistance genes in carbapenem-resistant Enterbacteriaceae and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli [86]. Yosef et al. used an engineered temperate phage delivering the CRISPR-Cas system together with an engineered lytic phage to re-sensitize bacteria to antibiotics and selectively kill antibiotic-resistant bacterial cells [89].",

In a murine model of systemic inflammatory response, the count of viable phage decreased in circulation and in numerous tissues due to the action of phagocytes, antibodies, and serum complement [111]. There are two ways to counteract this problem: (i) the selection of long-circulating phage and (ii) the use of growth- and/or lysis-deficient phage. To avoid the problem of phage elimination by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) of the host, Merril et al. [112] serially injected phage (E. coli phage Lambda and S. typhimurium phage P22, resp.) into mice to search for phage mutants capable of remaining in the circulatory system for longer times. The isolated long-circulating phage mutants after ten selection cycles had approximately five orders of magnitude higher capacity to evade RES clearance than the wild-type phage tested 24 h after intraperitoneal administration. Lambda phage mutant obtained after selection had a relevant mutation in the major capsid protein E [112]. By using genetic engineering, Vitiello et al. introduced just this single mutation in the major capsid gene and obtained a similar longer circulating phage mutant [113]. Very recently, Nan et al. demonstrated that lytic phage T7, mutated by the expression of CD47-derived peptides, showed prolonged blood circulation and thereby dramatically increased antibacterial activity in mice in vivo [114].",

Many bacteria produce high-molecular weight polysaccharides present on the surface of the cell. These polysaccharides contribute to pathogenicity, protect bacteria from phagocytosis, can increase biofilm production, and are physical barriers to phage preventing access to their receptors. Phage have evolved to use polysaccharide structures as their primary receptors by having depolymerization activities in their neck, base plate, and/or tail fibers that degrade polymers to smaller subunits [133]. Phages with this property produce haloed plaques due to the production of free depolymerase enzymes that remove polysaccharides of the neighboring cells thereby conferring a great advantage in biofilm prevention or removal. Depolymerases do not lyse bacteria but sensitize them against antibiotics or other antimicrobials [141\u2013143]. Pires et al. [133] have collected information about all depolymerases encoded by fully sequenced phage. They found 160 putative depolymerases in 143 double-stranded DNA phage infecting 24 genera of bacteria.",

These enzymes can be located in the virion, often referred to as virion-associated lysins (VALs), and act during viral DNA entry. These enzymes attack the cell wall from outside and promote the injection of phage DNA. In contrast, endolysins normally accumulate in the cytoplasm and, via pores formed by phage-encoded holins, they reach the peptidoglycans and disrupt them [72, 145]. Endolysins and holins are required for the programmed host cell lysis during progeny phage release in the end of a productive phage replication. Purified lysins also can lyse bacterial cultures in vitro. VALs and endolysins are categorized according to the peptidoglycan bond they cleave into different classes. The enzymatic diversity of these enzymes is remarkable [72].",

Artilysin\u00ae Art-175 is very effective also against highly resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii [149]. Generally, they are species-specific thereby allowing selective killing of a given pathogen saving accompanying microflora [138]. The effect of the degrading activity of endolysins can be demonstrated in seconds as osmotic lysis of the targeted cell [135]. For an improved antimicrobial activity, endolysins were also combined with holin [150] or depolymerase [151] against Staphylococcus aureus/S. suis and S. aureus biofilms, respectively. Moreover, the right combination of phage lytic proteins and antibiotics or bacteriocins significantly increased survival in animal experiments [134, 152\u2013154]. Application of phage-derived enzymes in various model systems was excellently summarized recently [134, 135].",

Design of new enzymes by deletion and shuffling of domains, synthesis of truncated proteins, and production of chimeric enzymes by combining domains from different lytic proteins (\u201cchimeolysins\u201d) have shown good results with regard to the development of improved lytic proteins [134, 156, 157]. This includes not only the ability to change binding and catalytic specificity, but also protein solubility and thermostability [138]. Sobieraj et al. reported the fusion of a staphylococcal endolysin to an albumin-binding domain that increased the half-life of the proteins [158]. Wang et al. combined an endolysin from a Staphylococcus aureus phage with a cell-penetrating peptide that facilitates crossing of the eukaryotic membrane by the lytic protein and thereby can kill intracellular infections by S. aureus [157]. A first product containing an endolysin for use in humans is available on the market (Staphefekt, Gladskin brand). This product is recommended for the treatment of early stages of S. aureus-related skin infections [134]. Resistance acquisition to lysins has not been observed so far. This may be due to the fact that their targets in the peptidoglycan molecule are essential for bacterial viability and mutations would be to harmful to the bacteria [134, 159, 160].",
