However, human AGT (hMGMT) is a double-edged sword\u2014on the one hand, it protects healthy cells from these genotoxic and carcinogenic effects, but also counteracts alkylating agents-based chemotherapy by protecting cancer cells from the killing effect of these drugs [10,11]. Consequently, hMGMT has emerged as a crucial factor in anticancer therapies [12]\u2014an inverse relationship has been discovered between the presence of hMGMT and the sensitivity of cells to the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents, such as temozolomide (TMZ), in different types of cancer cells, including prostate, breast, colon, and lung cancer cells [13].",

Hence, in order to counteract the action of hMGMT in chemotherapy regimens, a large number of studies aimed to the develop hMGMT inhibitors to be used in combination with alkylating agents. In view of this therapeutic relevance, much success has been obtained through the design of hMGMT pseudo-substrates, namely, the O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) and the strong inactivator O6-[4-bromothenyl]-guanine (O6-BTG, Lomeguatrib) [13,14]. These compounds mimic damaged guanine on DNA and react with the protein by the covalent transfer of the alkyl adduct to the active site cysteine residue, thus irreversibly inactivating the enzyme (Figure 1, red path). Therapeutically, O6-BG is not toxic on its own, but renders cancer cells 2 to 14 times more sensitive to alkylating agents\u2019 effects. The oligonucleotides containing several O6-BG are potent inhibitors and represent a valid alternative to the use of free modified guanines, thereby improving the activity of the alkylating chemotherapy drug in the treatment of some tumours [15,16,17].",

To achieve this, the protein of interest is expressed in a fusion with additional genetically encoded polypeptides, called tags, which mediate the labelling. The first example of an autofluorescent tag was the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) allowing the in vivo localization of fusion proteins in cellular and molecular biology [18,19]. Among affinity tags, of particular importance are the poly(His)-tag, the chitin-binding protein, the maltose-binding protein [20], the Strep-tag [21], and the glutathione-S-transferase (GST-tag) [22], which allow fast and specific purification of proteins of interest from their crude biological source using affinity techniques. Solubilization tags are especially useful to assist the proper folding of recombinant proteins expressed in chaperone-deficient species such as Escherichia coli, avoiding protein precipitation and the use of alternative expression protocols [23,24]\u2014these include thioredoxin [25] and poly(NANP).

They started from the knowledge that hMGMT tolerates the presence of groups conjugated to the pseudo-substrate O6-BG (O6-BG derivatives)\u2014the unusual covalent bond with the benzyl moiety can therefore be exploited for \u201cbiotech\u201d purposes (Figure 1, green path). Thanks to its small size, the engineered hMGMT (SNAP-tag) can be fused with other proteins of interest. The expression of the fusion protein inside the cells followed by incubation with opportune fluorescent derivatives leads to in vivo labelling of fusion proteins with the probe, which can be used for localization studies [26]. The same principle has also been used for the immobilization of tagged fusion proteins in vitro [30]. This offers a delicate condition for fixing and disposing in a better orientation of a wide range of proteins/enzymes on a surface. The SNAP-tag technology was successfully applied to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for the covalent immobilization of proteins of interest [31]. Another interesting application of this protein-tag is the possibility to produce new antibody fragments (scFv-SNAP) to be employed in the SPR analysis [32].",

            "text": "A comparative structural analysis performed on AGT proteins whose structures are in the Protein Data Bank revealed significant differences of the intrinsic structural features that have been considered to be relevant for thermostability, such as helix capping, intramolecular contacts (hydrogen bonds, ion-pairs), and solvent-accessible surface areas. Helix capping plays a central role in the stability of \u03b1-helices, due to lack of intra-helical hydrogen bonds in the first and last turn [42,43], and its effect results in an overall structural stabilization of protein folding [44]. By inspecting the crystal structure of SsOGT (PDB ID: 4ZYE), considered here as the thermophilic reference AGT protein, we verified that the five \u03b1-helices of the composing the protein tertiary structure are characterized by the presence of helix capping, this possibly increasing the thermal stability. In particular, the helix H1 at the NTD is stabilised by a peculiar double serine sequence (S40\u2013S41) and a glutamic acid (E54) at its CTD, the latter is strictly conserved in all AGTs from thermophilic organisms (see Figure 2a). The HTH motif, built on helices H3 and H4, is stabilized at the level of H3 by a highly conserved threonine residue (T89) as N-cap and a serine (S96), distinctive of SsOGT, as C-cap. Furthermore, helix H4 contains two serine-based capping among which the one placed at NTD (S100) is strictly conserved in all thermophilic AGTs and is followed by a proline (P101) that fits well in the first turn of the helix thanks to its own backbone conformation. Finally, the helix H5 is protected by glutamic acid capping that is present in all the AGTs from different species. Another feature contributing to thermal stability is the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). Indeed, the decrease of SASA and the increase of hydrophobic residues that are buried from the solvent have stabilizing principles for thermostable protein [45]. As described in Table 2, SsOGT shows the smaller total SASA value, in line with its exceptional stability. On the contrary, OGT from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [38,46] has a higher value due to the peculiar conformation of both the active site loop and the C-terminal tail that are exposed to the bulk solvent and are less heat stable (Table 2).",

This non-fluorescent substrate lowers the final fluorescent signal on gel imaging analysis, depending on its concentration. In this way, it is possible to measure the activity of AGTs for their natural substrate, giving an indirect measure of methylation repair efficiency (Figure 3) [38,39,46,52,59,60]. By using this methodology, it was even possible to discriminate the SsOGT activity regarding the position of the O6-MG on DNA (see below; [39]), in line with previous data on hMGMT [64].",

To assay the activity to SsOGT-H5, it was necessary to choose models in which the endogenous AGT activity is suppressed. Thermus thermophilus is an ogt- species, showing only one agt homologue (TTHA1564), whose annotation corresponds to an alkyltransferase-like protein (ATL) [73]. ATLs are a class of proteins present in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes [74], presenting aminoacidic motifs similar to those of AGTs\u2019 CTD, in which a tryptophan residue replaces the cysteine in the active site [75]. Like AGTs, ATLs use a helix-turn-helix motif to bind the minor groove of the DNA, but they do not repair it as they only recruit and interact with proteins involved in the nucleotide excision repair system [76,77].

SsOGT-H5, in turn, gives the unique opportunity to label immobilized enzymes with any desired chemical groups (opportunely conjugated to the benzyl-guanine; in magenta in Figure 5) [27,59], dramatically expanding biotechnological applications of this new tool. Depending of the chemical group of choice, modulating the activity of enzymes fused with the ASLtag can be possible by introducing activator or inhibitor molecules (Figure 5). The ASLtag system was successfully employed for the expression and immobilization of monomeric biocatalysts, such as the thermostable carbonic anhydrase from Saccharolobus solfataricus (SspCA), as well as the tetrameric Ss\u03b2gly, without affecting their folding and catalytic activity [86]. Moreover, SspCA fused to the ASLtag showed an increase in residual activity of up to 30 % for a period of 10 days at 70 \u00b0C [87], representing a huge advantage in pushing beyond reactions in bioreactors and in the reutilization of biocatalysts.",

            "text": "To extend the SNAP-tag technology to hyperthermophilic microorganisms for in vivo studies, an O6-alklylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase has been recently characterized from the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus [89]. This extremophilic microorganism was originally isolated from hot marine sediments in Vulcano Island (Italy) [90], with an optimum growth temperature around 100 \u00b0C, thus thriving under extremely harsh conditions. Like those of other thermophilic Archaea, its enzymes are extremely thermostable and can be used in various biotechnological applications. For example, DNA polymerase I, also known as PfuDNA polymerase, is one of the most famous and frequently used enzymes from P. furiosus because of its high activity, thermostability, and strong 3\u2032-5\u2032 proof-reading activity [91]. The first demonstration of an OGT activity in P. furiosus was in 1998, when Margison and co-workers identified a protein of 22 kDa, whose catalytic activity was abolished by the O6-BG pseudo-substrate. The PF1878 ORF is relative to a protein of 20.1 kDa. From its primary structure, the relative polypeptide seems to be closely related to the MGMT from Pyrococcus kodakarensis KOD1 (Pk-MGMT) [48,89,92]. The extreme thermostability was confirmed by in vitro biochemical studies on the heterologous expressed and characterized OGT protein from P. furiosus PfuOGT. This enzyme was active on BG-fluorescent substrates, thus allowing the competitive assay with methylated dsDNA. However, the experiments were performed at 65 \u00b0C instead of the standard procedure at 50 \u00b0C, as described for SsOGT [39,59,60], due to the strong thermophilicity of this enzyme. This behaviour was effectively confirmed by differential scan fluorimetry analysis where the temperature melting (Tm) of PfuOGT was found to be 80 \u00b0C, much higher than that of SsOGT (68 \u00b0C) [89]. It is worth noting that, in order to obtain a the sigmoidal melting curve for PfuOGT, a slower heating rate (10 min/\u00b0C \u00d7 cycle) was set up, whereas the Tm value measurement is usually performed at 1 min/\u00b0C \u00d7 cycle [93].",

            "text": "Thermotoga neapolitana is a hyperthermophilic Gram-negative bacterium of the order of Thermotogales [94,95,96], which are excellent models for genetic engineering and biotechnological applications [97,98,99,100]. The CTN1690 ORF shows a clear homology of the O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyl-transferase. SDS-PAGE gel imaging analysis on lyophilized T. neapolitana cells incubated with the AGT fluorescent substrate showed a strong fluorescent signal with a molecular weight close to that of SsOGT. The observed molecular weight and, above all, the sensitivity to the O6-BG derivative, led to the cloning and heterologous expression of the Thermotoga neapolitana OGT protein (TnOGT) in E. coli [89]. This protein, like most AGTs, has a role in DNA repair, as confirmed by competitive fluorescent assay in the presence of methylated dsDNA. As shown in Figure 3, the IC50 value was similar to that obtained for SsOGT. Surprisingly, the enzyme from T. neapolitana exhibited a very high activity at low temperatures [89], similar to that possessed by the mutant SsOGT-H5 (Table 3) [52,59]. Superimposition analysis between a TnOGT 3D model and the free form of SsOGT (ID PDB: 4ZYE) revealed in both structures the presence of a serine residue in the active site loop (S132 in SsOGT, see Figure 2a), which was replaced in SsOGT-H5 by a glutamic acid to improve its activity at lower temperatures. Interestingly, some residues are missing in TnOGT that play an important role in stabilizing SsOGT. In particular, the ionic interactions that play a crucial role in the stability of the Saccharolobus enzyme at high temperatures, such as the pair R133-D27 [39] and the K-48 network [60], are largely replaced by hydrophobic residues in the Thermotoga homolog. Evidently, different residues and mechanisms of stabilization may contribute to its exceptional catalytic activity at moderate temperatures and the high thermal stability.",

Studies on thermophilic AGTs represent a unique opportunity for structural analysis and, in the case of the S. solfataricus protein, for the identification of conformational changes after the trans-alkylation reaction, which are detectable with mesophilic AGTs, as the alkylated form are rapidly destabilized [6]. These results could have a wide impact, especially in medical fields for the design of novel hMGMT inhibitors to be used in cancer therapy [102]. Furthermore, given their small size, thermophilic enzymes are very useful for studying general stabilization mechanisms at high temperatures (as for Pk-MGMT and SsOGT), which can then be applied to mesophilic enzymes. Searching for alternative SsOGT homologues was clearly useful, leading to the identification of AGTs that are more resistant to thermal denaturation (PfuOGT) or to enzymes with a higher reaction rate at all tested temperatures (TnOGT).",
