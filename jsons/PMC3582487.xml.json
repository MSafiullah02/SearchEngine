Gonwa et al. reported that 35% of liver transplant recipients with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) needed RRT postoperatively versus only 5% without HRS [9]. Although TPL can correct HRS, interestingly the renal function often recovers only to a glomerular filtration rate of 30-40 ml/min. Potential explanation seems to be the administration of immunosuppressants in these cases [10,11]. Furthermore, renal failure is leading to prolonged hospital stay, increased rate of rejection and rate of infection in liver transplant recipients [8]. There are many reports regarding preoperative renal function, especially the role of preoperative creatinine serum levels in post-operative outcomes in liver transplant recipients [12-14].",

Postoperatively used nephrotoxic agents like antibiotics or immunosuppressants may further contribute to progressive renal failure [18]. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between pretransplant and peritransplant factors contributing to the pathogenesis of renal failure resulting in RRT in liver transplant recipients. The calculated Cockcroft formula is easy to assess and is of clinical importance because for instance renal impairment dosages of drugs are estimated by calculating the estimated creatinine clearance using this formula. Little is known about the significance of the preoperative calculated Cockcroft formula in assessing postoperative outcome in liver transplant recipients. There are concerns about its use in the context of advanced cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure [19]. Therefore, in this post hoc analysis we compared the mortality rates of 135 consecutive liver transplant recipients over 6 years in our center subject to their renal baseline conditions and postoperative RRT. Furthermore, we tried to identify pre- and perioperative risk factors for the development of acute or acute-on-chronic renal failure after liver transplantation.",

Potential explanation for the highest mortality might be more postoperative liver cell damage or impaired function \u2013 indicated by elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin peak serum levels- with consecutive multiorgan-dysfunction-syndrome, inclusive renal dysfunction, infections and finally with mortality as shown in Tables 3 and 4. Therefore, the use of marginal grafts might contribute to such a postoperative course as described previously [30].

On that basis, the strategy to transfuse as few RBC intraoperatively as possible seems to be a promising concept and a high priority aim [36,37]. More blood loss intraoperatively might lead to reduced survival in liver TPL [38]. Interestingly, our study group 3 had also significant more intraoperative blood loss, which is in line with that data. After the study by Massicotte et al. low CVP and restrictive transfusion regime were strongly propagated [37], but the excellent results in that study occurred in a study population with mean MELD of 18. Whether this strategy is also as beneficial in sicker patients with higher MELD scores, e.g. 21 in our study remains still to be determined. During liver transplantation and its long and difficult anesthesia the patients might become hypovolemic and hypotensive resulting in impaired organ perfusion, i.e. kidney perfusion and in turn might contribute to postoperative renal failure [39]. Furthermore, the reperfusion after portal unclamping results in decreased heart rate, contractility and peripheral vascular resistance leading also to cardiovascular instability [40]. Therefore, the concept of \u201ckeep the patient dry\u201d must be examined very carefully, in particularly in regard to the data reported by Schroeder et al., which reported more renal failure and RRT with worse survival in a low CVP group [41].",
