The model presented here describes with reasonable agreement the number of COVID-19 cases registered in Brazil between February 26 and April 25, 2020 based on the hypothesis that there a large number no notified cases (11 to 1) and variation in contagion rate according to social isolation measures and greater or lesser exposure to the virus (highest rate in beginning from epidemic). To this end, we introduced an exposure factor, called \u03b2 1 /\u03b2 2 , which allows us to describe the influence of factors such as social isolation on dispersal from disease. The results also corroborate a phenomenon observed in countries that registered a high growth in cases in short period of time, to example of Italy, Spain and USA: if isolation measures are imposed late, the total number of cases explodes when the epidemic is approaching from peak, which implies a higher exposure rate in the first days of case registration. The model also predicts that the peak epidemic outbreak in Brazil, based on the number of cases, will occur around May 20, 2020.",

In 1927, W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick (1927) created a model that considers a fixed population with only three compartments: sensitive, S (t); infected, I (t), and removed, R (t) -SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) -for the first time, in order to study the evolution of epidemic processes and how the spread of infectious diseases over time .

However, there are variants of the SIR model that can be applied in situations in which another variables are important for description how the infection spreads in a population of S susceptible individuals, to example as was done in Teles' work (2020) adapting the SIR model to describe the behavior of the coronavirus infected curve in Portugal.",

In these places, families live in just one room, being impossible to separate risk groups, such as senior, from people who need to go out to work and return home, increasing the risk of contamination. In many of these communities, there no are basic sanitation conditions are, impending simple processes such as hand hygiene frequently, as recommended by authorities.",

The results also corroborate with a phenomenon observed in countries that registered a high growth in cases in a short period of time, such as Italy, Spain and the USA: if isolation measures are imposed late, the total number of cases explodes in way epidemic is approaching from maximum peak, which implies a higher exposure rate in the first days of case registration. The model also predicts that the peak epidemic outbreak in Brazil, based on the number of cases, will occur around May 20, 2020.",
