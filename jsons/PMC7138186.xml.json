            "text": "The outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to the current global health crisis. As of late March, there have been over 315,000 cases worldwide and over 25,000 cases in the United States [1]. COVID-19 has been of concern to many health care workers (HCW's) in the emergency department (ED), due to potential exposure and the possibility of transmitting the virus to other patients and family members. Currently, personal protection equipment (PPE) recommendations are in flux and it is unclear if patients outside of \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d require PPE [2]. Furthermore, as increasing asymptomatic and atypical presentations develop, clear guidance is needed for HCW's. In China, asymptomatic and atypical presentations with gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported [3], and it has been suggested that up to 10% of COVID-19 patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, due to limited data and an unknown true disease prevalence, it is unclear what percentage of patients present atypically without respiratory symptoms [4]. In addition, a study showed that up to 18% of patients had no radiographic or CT abnormality [5]. As studies continue to demonstrate more patients who present asymptomatically or atypically, our need for increased guidance on PPE grows. We present a case report of a man who was referred to the ED for abdominal and testicular pain who was subsequently found to test positive for COVID-19.",

The patient originally presented to his PCP's office one week prior, where he was diagnosed with constipation and sent home on a bowel regimen. The pain intermittently continued with waxing and waning severity for 8 days prompting his ED presentation. The patient described his symptoms as a constant stabbing pain that originated from his groin and migrated to his abdomen, flank, back, and chest. Additionally, he reported subjective fevers two days before presentation. On review of systems, he denied any rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.",

The patient's blood laboratory values were benign including a normal white blood count. His chest radiograph revealed no abnormal findings as read by radiology. The CT of his abdomen and pelvis captured the lung bases which revealed pulmonary ground glass opacification and consolidation consistent with pneumonia in addition to possible colitis of the sigmoid and distal descending colon. The patient was subsequently started on cefpodoxime and azithromycin for treatment of both his colitis and pneumonia and discharged home with instruction to follow up with his PCP.",

However, it is the authors' opinion that given the of risk of COVID-19 to HCW\u2019s and continued atypical presentations that PPE to include a face mask should be considered for every patient depending on the incidence of COVID-19 within their community. As we continue in this health crisis it is critical that communication continues to be of the utmost importance [9]. In this case, communication could have protected dozens of patients and HCW's. It should be noted that this case was at the beginning of the United States outbreak when national and institutional standards were in their infancy, and new adaptations to these standards are being made daily. We present this case as a lesson learned from the front lines and to bring awareness of atypical COVID-19 cases as they continue to present.",
