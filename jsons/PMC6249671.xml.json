Type I IFNs consist of 13 IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and IFN-\u03b2, -\u03c9 (human), and -\u03b6 (mouse) -\u025b and -\u03ba. The type III family of IFNs in humans comprises 3 functional genes that express IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL-28A), and IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B) (Kotenko and others 2003; Sheppard and others 2003). A fourth IFN-\u03bb subtype (IFN-\u03bb4) is present in a part of the human population, depending on a dinucleotide frameshift polymorphism upstream of the IFNL3 gene, which creates or disrupts the open reading frame (ORF) encoding IFN-\u03bb4 (Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013). In the mouse, Ifnl1 is a pseudogene, and only IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 are expressed. Unlike mouse and human type I IFNs that exhibit strongly species-specific activity (Veomett and Veomett 1979), type III IFNs were reported to act on cell types from both origins (Lasfar and others 2006; Hermant and others 2014).",

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IFN-\u03bb detection is time and cost intensive and fails to detect IFN-\u03bb4. Conventional cytopathic effect reduction bioassays to quantify antiviral activity as a proxy for the presence of IFN require the manipulation of infectious virus. Luciferase reporter cells that have previously been used for recombinant human IFN-\u03bb detection were still responsive to type I IFN and would not allow specific IFN-\u03bb detection from biological samples (Uze and Monneron 2007). In this work, we reexamined the species specificity of IFN-\u03bb activity, and we developed a very sensitive luciferase-based bioassay specific for type III IFN detection.",

Although IFN-\u03bb4 is not expressed in mouse and rat, it is highly conserved in many mammalian species (Key and others 2014) where it was shown to be cross-reactive. The nonhuman IFN-\u03bb4 orthologs were reported to activate IFNLR1 in human cells, sometimes with a higher efficacy than human IFN-\u03bb4 (eg, dog IFN-\u03bb4) (Paquin and others 2016). The mouse cell response to human IFN-\u03bb4 is thus in line with the ability of IFN-\u03bb4 to be cross-reactive among mammalian species, although we do not have any physiological explanation for this phenomenon.",
