This chapter of research is an effort to highlight the phytochemical/chemical constituents of an ancient medicinal plant G. glabra and their pharmacological importance. G. glabra is an old age medicinal plant that belongs to Leguminosae/Fabaceae/ Papilionaceae family and commonly known as mulaithi in north India. The chemical composition of G. glabra is glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetic acid, isoliquiritin, isoflavones, etc., and their derivatives have been reported for several pharmacological activities like, expectorant, antidemulcent, antiulcer, anticancer, antiinflammatory, antidiabetic, etc. These phytochemicals hold strong promise for designing new herbal drugs, and derivatives of these compounds are being generated to evaluate their pharmacological purposes for future drug use. Natural products have been a prime source for the treatment of many forms of ailments, many of which are consumed daily with the diet. They provide significant protection against various diseases and disorders.",

The most important of these bioactive constituents of plants are triterpenoid, saponin, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds [1] . Many of these indigenous medicinal plants are used as spices and food plants. They are also sometimes added to foods meant for pregnant and nursing mothers for medicinal purposes [2, 3] .",

Glycyrrhizin (Fig. 2) , a triterpenoid compound, accounts for the sweet taste of licorice root. This compound represents a mixture of potassiumcalcium-magnesium salts of glycyrrhizic acid that varies within a 2-25% range. Among the natural saponin, glycyrrhizic acid is a molecule composed of a hydrophilic part, two molecules of glucuronic acid, and a hydrophobic fragment, glycyrrhetic acid ( Fig. 3 ) [10] . The yellow color of licorice is due to the flavonoid content of the plant, which includes liquiritin (Fig. 4) , isoliquiritin (Fig. 5 ) (a chalcone) and other compounds [11] . The isoflavones, glabridin ( Fig. 6 ) and [12] , and both glabridin and glabrene possess estrogen-like activity [13] .",

Glycyrrhizinic acids have been used to cure atopic dermatitis, pruritis, and cysts due to parasitic infestations of skin [19, 20] . ",

Glycyrrhetic acid could trigger the proapoptotic pathway by inducing mitochondrial permeability transition, and this property may be useful for inducing apoptosis of tumor cells [31, 32] . The licorice extract induced the Bcl2 phosphorylation and G2/M cycle arrest in tumor cell lines, and 70% methanol soluble fraction of licorice acetone extract was found to induce apoptosis in human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells.

In Japan, glycyrrhizin has been used for more than 60 years as treatment for chronic hepatitis under the name of SNMC (stronger neo-minophagen-C) clinically as an antiallergic and antihepatitis agent [38] . Glycyrrhizin induced significant reduction in serum aminotransferases and improved the liver histology when compared with the placebo. It has also been implicated that longterm usage of glycyrrhizin prevents development of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis C. In vitro studies have indicated that glycyrrhizin modifies the intracellular transport and uppresses hepatitis B virus surface antigen [39, 40] . It has been found that 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), an aglycone of glycyrrhizin decreases the expression of P450 E1 thereby protecting the liver [41] . GA also prevents the oxidative and hepatic damage caused by aflatoxins by increasing the CYP1A1 and GST (glutathione-S-transferase) activities and may also contribute to anticarcinogenic activity by metabolic deactivation of the hepatotoxin [42] . One of the researches indicated that the hydromethanolic root extract of G. glabra exhibited significant protection from hepatotoxicity induced by CCl 4 (carbon tetrachloride) in liver tissue of experimental mice [43] . It has also been experimentally investigated that glycyrrhizin and its analogues have a mitogenic effect via epidermal growth factor receptors subsequently stimulating the MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase pathway to induce hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation [44] .",

PPAR's (peroxisome proliferation activated receptors) are ligand-dependent transcriptional factors regulating the expression of a group of genes that play an important role in glucose and lipid metabolism. The PPAR receptors are classified as PPAR-\u03b1, PPAR-\u03b3, and PPAR-\u03b4. The PPAR-\u03b1 is found in liver, muscle, and kidney. PPAR-\u03b3 is associated with adipose tissue, adrenals, and small intestine whereas PPAR-\u03b4 is expressed ubiquitously. PPAR-\u03b3 serves as a predominant target for insulin sensitizing drugs like pioglitazone and roziglitazone. Ethyl acetate extract of licorice using GAL-4-PPAR-\u03b3 chimera assay exhibited a significant PPAR-\u03b3 binding activity which was attributed to seven phenolic compounds, viz., dehydroglyasperin, glyasperin B, glyasperin D, glycycoumarin, glycyrin, glycyrol, and isolglycyrol. Pioglitazone and glycyrin were found to suppress the increased blood glucose level in mice after sucrose loading during the oral sucrose tolerance test. Pioglitazone, a potent PPAR\u03b3 agonist ameliorated the insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Similarly, glycyrin also exhibited a potent PPAR-\u03b3 ligand binding activity and therefore reduces the blood glucose level in KK-Ay (knockout diabetic mice). This finding is of much significance as licorice has also been traditionally used as an artificial sweetening agent and could be helpful in insulin resistance syndrome prevalent in the modern society [45] .",

The most common reported side effect with licorice supplementation is elevated blood pressure. This is thought to be due to the effect of licorice on the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. It is suggested licorice saponins are capable of potentiating aldosterone action while binding to mineral-corticoid receptors in the kidneys. In addition to hypertension, patients may experience hypokalemia and sodium retention, resulting in edema. All symptoms usually disappear with discontinuation of therapy. Many studies report no side effects during the course of treatment [27, 28] . Generally the onset and severity of symptoms depend on the dose and duration of licorice intake, as well as individual susceptibility. The amount of licorice ingested daily by patients with mineralcorticoid excess syndromes appears to vary over a wide range, from as little as 1.5 g daily to as much as 250 g daily [5, 29] .",

G. glabra is an herbal plant which has lots of medicinal properties such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitussive, antidiabetic, antiviral, anticancer, antimutagenic, antiulcer, and hepatoprotective. The phytochemicals present in G. glabra have been of immense importance in phytotherapeutics. Thus there is an immense need to modify the natural Glycyrrhiza constituents to reduce these side effects thereby generating the advanced versions of the bioactive compounds to be used as drugs in future. There are so many bioactive compounds that have been isolated from G. glabra like glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetic acid, glabridin, liquiritin, isoliquiritigenin, isoflavones, etc. and have been assessed for medicinal potential which showed that these compounds hold a strong promise in designing future drugs. Derivatives of these compounds are being generated to evaluate their pharmacological purposes for future drug use. There are ample chances of arriving to pharmacophores with least toxic side effects using combinatorial chemistry.",
