            "text": "In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan, China has rapidly spread to all over the world. As of April 1, 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has increased to 823 626, and the number of deaths has risen to 40 598 (WHO, 2020). On January 20, 2020, China incorporated COVID-19 into the group of class B infectious diseases and managed it according to class A procedures. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern (WHO, 2020). Medical institutions, especially hospitals, were to increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who would require hospitalization, and there were 1 512 designated hospitals in China that provided therapy to patients with COVID-19 alone (Yangjiang Daily, 2020) .The work hours per shift among nurses, who serve as important members of medical and health institutions play a key role in the response effects of the epidemic and in nurses' physical and mental health (Lam et al., 2018) . Previous evidence has suggested that work hours for nurses could affect quality of care (Griffiths et al., 2014) . The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (National Health Commission of the PRC) recommended 4 h per shift for intensive care unit nurses in the hospitals providing treatment to patients with COVID-19 (National Health Commission of the PRC, 2020). Related studies have also reported work hours per shift of frontline nurses in their studies . However, given that many units and different posts were involved in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the nurses reported preferred work hours per shift of different units and posts are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate and analyse the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours per shift for different units and posts among frontline nurses in China. In addition, we will explore the factors influencing the nurses reported preferred work hours. Military District Hospital) were investigated with a convenient sampling method for working closely to the authors or researchers involved in this study. The authors and researchers were deployed to these designated hospitals during the period of the study and were recruited participants in their respective areas. Approximately 10~100 potential participants in each designated hospital was known to the authors and researchers and finally a total of 109 nurses agreed to participate in this study.This facilitated the recruitment of participants in the respective areas of the designated hospitals and ensured that the sample was representative of all individuals working in this setting. As there were no previous studies in similar populations available, no formal sample size calculation was performed.",

The potentially overwhelming burden of illnesses that stressed the capacity of health systems and cause adverse effects, such as the risk of infection among health care workers has increased, affecting both nurses and the quality of healthcare that nurses provide. Numerous studies have focused on the effects of extended and shorten work hours on patients, nurses and organizations. Lam et al showed that human resource limitation is one of the main factors hindering emergency nurses' response to emerging infectious disease epidemic behaviour (Lam et al., 2019) . Kunaviktikul et al reported that the prolonged work hours of nurses can contribute to a series of adverse effects on nurses themselves, patients and the health system (Kunaviktikul et al., 2015) . Bae et al concluded that when the shift length was 12 h, patients' adverse outcomes (i.e., hypoglycaemia events or errors, proximity errors, and pneumonia death), adverse events reports, and dissatisfaction increased (Bae and Fabry, 2014) .",

In addition, 60.55% (66/109)of nurses considered 4 h to be the preferred length of work per shift (Table 2) , which was consistent with the recommendation of 4 h by the National Health Commission of the PRC on February 29,2020 (National Health Commission of the PRC, 2020) . In terms of the different units of analysis, the actual work hours of intensive care unit nurses were the same as the nurses reported preferred work hours, and the actual work hours of the remaining units were longer than the nurses reported preferred work hours. This may be related to the fact that patients in the intensive care unit were in such serious condition that managers tended to allocate more nurses to this area. In contrast, the actual work hours of the direct nursing posts were the same as the nurses reported preferred work hours of nurses in different posts, the actual work hours of other posts were longer than the preferred work hours. However, our results also suggested that the work hours of direct nursing posts were fewer than those of indirect nursing posts (table 3) . This may be explained by nurse managers requiring nurses of indirect nursing posts to not wear personal preventable equipment and work for longer hours to conserve protective equipment and human resources, because nurses without personal preventable equipment can go to toilet or eat food timely. Peng et al reported that they had set the nurses' work hours per shift to 12 h, 4h, and 2-3 h according to the workload and posts (Peng et al., 2020) . Gagliano et al also concluded that sub-district post management was beneficial to conserve manpower and protective equipment resources (Gagliano et al., 2020) .",

Five themes appeared which included circumstances, personal preventable equipment, the physical and psychological needs of nurses, the safety needs of nurses and work intensity. Circumstances indicate that different units and posts have different requirements. Nurse 107: \"It is ideal to set work hours according to different circumstances (units and posts)\". The main problems of the personal preventable equipment were that nurses had to spend large amount of time wearing it, and fog drops appeared on the goggles which could block nurses' line of sight. Moreover, pain, dehydration, sweating and other symptoms of discomfort occurred during the use of personal preventable equipment. As far as the physiological and psychological needs of nurses are concerned, they mainly included respiratory needs, getting adequate rest, eating food and going to the toilet, because nurses are prone to hypoxia, dyspnoea, headache, fatigue, hunger and stress during work. For nurses' safety needs, work hours can affect the risk of infection, e g , according to -Nurse 95: \"4 h was preferred which can reduce the risk of infection and preserve physical strength\". Finally, work intensity encompassed the efficiency work and overwork, e g , as stated by-Nurse 39: \"There was so much work (i.e., prepare oxygen cylinder, provide care to patient, observe of the condition of the patients) that needed to be done\". The results from an earlier study reported that COVID-19 was spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020) , and personal preventable equipment is a necessary for medical staff to protect themselves from being infected. However, the use of personal preventable equipment has resulted in many problems. Zhou et al reported that personal preventable equipment could lead to sensory deprivation and a psychological stress response (Zhou et al., 2020) . A survey of frontline doctors and nurses in West Africa by Den Boon et al found that the use of personal preventable equipment resulted in sweating and dehydration among medical staff, and the prolonged use of goggles led to fog that their obscured vision, thus affecting their clinical practice (Den Boon et al., 2018) . Xia et al reported that in the course of using personal preventable equipment, pain, numbness, pressure, redness, or even damaged equipment related to the pressure damage are prone to occur (Xia et al., 2020) . Zou et al conducted a semi-structured interview with 7 frontline nursing staff caring for COVID-19 patients and concluded that the frontline nursing staff had a heavy workload (Yao et al., 2020) . All of these results were similar to the findings in our study.",
