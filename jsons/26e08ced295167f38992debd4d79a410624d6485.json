            "text": "Waterborne enteric viruses are an emerging cause of disease outbreaks and represent a major threat to 23 global public health. Enteric viruses may originate from human wastewater and can undergo rapid 24 transport through aquatic environments with minimal decay. Surveillance and source apportionment of 25 enteric viruses in environmental waters is therefore essential for accurate risk management. However, 26 individual monitoring of the >100 enteric viral strains that have been identified as aquatic contaminants is 27 unfeasible. Instead, viral indicators are often used for quantitative assessments of wastewater 28 contamination, viral decay and transport in water. An ideal indicator for tracking wastewater 29 contamination should be (i) easy to detect and quantify, (ii) source-specific, (iii) resistant to wastewater 30 treatment processes, and (iv) persistent in the aquatic environment, with similar behaviour to viral 31 pathogens. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of 127 peer-reviewed publications, to critically 32 evaluate the effectiveness of several viral indicators of wastewater pollution, including common enteric 33 viruses (mastadenoviruses, polyomaviruses, and Aichi viruses), the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), and 34 gut-associated bacteriophages (Type II/III FRNA phages and phages infecting human Bacteroides species, 35 including crAssphage). Our analysis suggests that overall, human mastadenoviruses have the greatest 36 potential to indicate contamination by domestic wastewater due to their easy detection, culturability, and 37 high prevalence in wastewater and in the polluted environment. Aichi virus, crAssphage and PMMoV are 38 also widely detected in wastewater and in the environment, and may be used as molecular markers for 39 human-derived contamination. We conclude that viral indicators are suitable for the long-term monitoring 40 of viral contamination in freshwater and marine environments and that these should be implemented 41 within monitoring programmes to provide a holistic assessment of microbiological water quality and 42 wastewater-based epidemiology, improve current risk management strategies and protect global human 43 health. 44 45",

Higher volumes (up 290 to 100 ml) of samples or concentrates are typically used for culture-based assays than for qPCR (a few 291 microliters of nucleic acid extract) and so culturing can be more sensitive than direct qPCR. However, this 292 method will produce plaques of a range of different strains that cannot be differentiated based on 293 morphology. Therefore, to identify and quantify specific FRNAP genogroups, it is necessary to use 294 genogroup-specific molecular detection methods. Such methods include RT-PCR analysis of plaques 295 (Haramoto et al., 2015 Many Bacteroides-associated phages are also culturable using appropriate hosts, including Bacteroides 298 strains GB-124, RYC2056, GA17 and ARABA-84, with double-layer agar method to quantify the number of 299 plaque forming units (pfu). However, the assay is more challenging than the plaque assay for FRNAP as 300 culturing Bacteroides spp. require anaerobic conditions, which may not be available in most laboratories. 301",

Using these viruses and their corresponding animal 319 associated strains, the source of contamination (e.g. human vs wildlife, livestock, etc.) can be assessed. For 320 example, Staggemeier et al.

Dias et al., 2018; Mcminn et al., 2014; Prado 427 et al., 2018; Purnell et al., 2015; Stefanakis et al., 2019; Wicki et al., 2015), BacRYC2056P were investigated 428 in Colombia, the UK, Spain, France, Cyprus, Sweden, Switzerland and Thailand (Cost\u00e1n-Longares et al., 429 2008; Gomila et al., 2008; Payan et al., 2005; Venegas et al., 2015; Wangkahad et al., 2017; Wicki et al., 430 2015, 2011), BacGA17P were found in Colombia and several European countries (Casanovas-Massana et al., 431 2015; Cost\u00e1n-Longares et al., 2008; Gomila et al., 2008; Mayer et al., 2016; Payan et al., 2005; Venegas et 432 al., 2015; Wicki et al., 2015) and BacARABA84P was identified in Switzerland (Wicki et al., 2015, 2011). 433 CrAssphage concentrations were only determined in wastewater in the UK (Wales), Australia and the USA 434 (Florida) (Ahmed et al., 2019a, 2018b; Farkas et al., 2018a). Due to the limited number of studies(Table 2), 435 further testing is necessary to evaluate the prevalence and distribution of AiV, FRNAP-II, FRNAP-III, 436culturable phages infecting Bacteroides, crAssphage and PMMoV in untreated wastewater to assess their 437 usefulness as indicators of wastewater pollution. Current data suggest that all assessed viral indicators, have been shown to be extremely resistant to traditional wastewater treatment procedures 442 (Figure 3;Table S7). As the removal efficiency varies amongst sites and the type of treatment process, 443 comparative studies have been performed to study the resistance of enteric viruses and potential 444 indicators during wastewater treatment.445 In this study, 24 studies comparing the virus removal efficiency of different wastewater treatment 446 processes were evaluated (Figure 3). Fifteen of these studies exclusively used qPCR and RT-qPCR for the 447 quantitative analysis of viral concentrations. As discussed in Section 3.1, these molecular techniques give 448 no indication on the infectivity state of the viruses and hence may overestimate infective viral titres in 449 untreated and treated wastewater and other environmental samples. This was demonstrated by Flannery 450 et al. (2013a) whose data showed that while infectious FRNAP-II in UV-treated effluent was approximately 451 2.3 log 10 less than influent, only a 0.54 log 10 reduction was found when using RT-qPCR alone. Most of this 452 reduction in FRNAP-II infectivity occurred during the secondary treatment stage (1.69 log 10 reduction), but 453 the type of secondary treatment used in that study was not specified. In a study by Lee et al. (2018), an 454 activated sludge process (a form of secondary treatment) resulted in 2.1 and 3.1 log 10 reductions of 455 infectious FRNAP-II and FRNAP-III, respectively. RT-qPCR analysis of the same samples showed log 10 456 reductions of 1.6 and 2.5 for FRNAP-II and FRNAP-III, respectively. The differences between infectious virus 457 and genome removal were not significant. These studies therefore reached conflicting conclusions with the 458 former showing that infectivity studies are vital and the latter showing that they are unnecessary. It is 459 possible that the activated sludge process used by Lee et al. (2018) resulted in physical removal of viruses, 460 while the process used by Flannery et al. (2013a) inactivated the viruses without physically removing them 461 from the treated water. This highlights the importance of including the specific mechanisms used within a 462 sewage treatment process when reporting such data, as it is not clear whether the secondary treatment al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2016; Prado et al., 2018; Stefanakis et al., 2019), except for one study showing >5.from a wide range of qPCR-based viral quantification studies have shown limited removal of 470 AdV, PyV, AiV, crAssphage and PMMoV during wastewater treatment. Activated sludge treatment and 471 biofiltration, without further treatment resulted in 0.6-1.9 and 0.3-3.0 log 10 removal of AdV and PyV, 472 respectively (Figure 3; Table S7). Tertiary treatment processes resulted in an additional 1-3.5 log 10 removal 473 of AdV and PyV with membrane bioreactors coupled with additional chlorination, filtration and UV 474 treatment being the most efficient method for viral removal (Qiu et al., 2018; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015; Simmons 475 et al., 2011). Furthermore, AdVs have been shown to be more resistant to UV treatment than poliovirus, 476 rotavirus, caliciviruses and hepatitis A virus (Hijnen et al., 2006). However, laboratory-scale studies suggest 477 that AdVs are more susceptible to chlorine treatment than enteroviruses and caliciviruses (Cromeans et al., 478 2010; Kahler et al., 2010; Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2005, 2003). Interestingly, significant differences were 479 found for the removal of PyV strains. MCV was found to be the most resistant to treatment followed by JCV 480 and BKV (Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015). 481 Fewer studies evaluated the removal of AiV, crAssphage and PMMoV, than the removal of AdVs, PyVs and 482 phages. Overall, AiV showed 1-3 log 10 reduction during secondary and 1-2 log reduction during tertiary 483 wastewater treatment (Kitajima et al., 2018a, 2014, 2013; Schmitz et al., 2016). The removal of crAssphage 484 was also in the range of 1.0-1.2 log 10 during secondary wastewater treatment (Farkas et al., 2019), 485 however, crAssphage removal has not been assessed during tertiary treatment yet. The current data 486 suggests that PMMoV is stable during secondary treatment and chlorination, which results in <2 log 487 reduction (Symonds et al., 2018). Larger PMMoV removal (>4 log) was only observed using 488 electrocoagulation and Bardenpho (aerobic/anaerobic multi-reactor) technologies (Schmitz et al., 2016; treatment and other wastewater treatment procedures to evaluate its usefulness as an indicator. The 491 major advantage of crAssphage and PMMoV is that their concentrations are usually high in wastewater, 492 and hence the efficiency of their removal can be easily monitored. Nonetheless, their infectivity and decay 493 have not been investigated due to the current lack of in vitro culturing-based methods. 494 In studies where the removal of indicator viruses was compared with the removal of common pathogenic 495 enteric viruses, indicator viruses showed similar or less removal than the pathogens (Carducci and Verani, 496 2013; Farkas et al., 2018a; Kitajima et al., 2014; Prado et al., 2019; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015; Schmitz et al., 2016). 497 Furthermore, a meta-analysis on the efficiency of secondary wastewater processes showed that activated 498 sludge treatment resulted in 0.20 -2.18 log 10 reduction of rotavirus, and norovirus GI and GII, whereas 499 biofiltration resulted in higher removal (1.52 -4.30 log 10 ) of norovirus GII and enteroviruses (Sano et al., 500 2016). These removal rates are higher than the removal rates determined for the indicators reviewed here 501 suggesting that the indicators can represent the removal of the most resistant viruses. However, three 502 studies showed higher removal rates of BKV and JCV than norovirus, sapovirus, enterovirus and rotavirus 503 (Farkas et al., 2018a; Fumian et al., 2013; Schmitz et al., 2016) suggesting that PyVs are less resistant than 504 the pathogenic viruses and hence should be used with caution as an indicator. Current data shows that 505 AdV, AiV, FRNAPII/III, crAssphage and PMMoV may be suitable for the assessment of wastewater 506 treatment processes. 507 As different viruses have varying reactions to wastewater treatment processes, the use of multiple 508 indicators is recommended. For indicators other than bacteriophages reviewed here, the exclusive use of 509 molecular detection and quantitation is a major limitation in understanding enteric virus removal. Hence, 510 combinations of infectivity studies and molecular assays should be performed for viruses that can be 511 cultured in vitro in order to assess viral survival during wastewater treatment. the studies that have been conducted to estimate viral persistence in natural waters have relied 514 solely on qPCR-based quantification. While the reliance on qPCR data alone may lead to overestimations of 515 infectious viral persistence, its use is nonetheless important especially when considering unculturable has focused on the occurrence and survival of indicator viruses in surface water. When 521 quantified in surface freshwater bodies (lakes, rivers, streams, etc.) by qPCR, these viral indicators (e.g. AiV, 522 AdV, JCV, PMMoV) are typically detected at up to 4 log 10 higher concentrations than common enteric 523 pathogenic viruses, e.g. norovirus, enterovirus and rotavirus (Hata et al., 2014; Jurzik et al., 2010; Rusi\u00f1ol et 524 al., 2015; Sassi et al., 2018). All indicator concentrations in river water correlated with the distance of 525 sampling point from the source of contamination (wastewater treatment plant), with significantly higher 526 concentrations occurring near the wastewater treatment plant than further downstream or upstream 527 (Ebdon et al., 2007; Farkas et al., 2018a; Prevost et al., 2015; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015; Sassi et al., 2018; Sibanda 528 and Okoh, 2012; Tandukar et al., 2018; Venegas et al., 2015; Wangkahad et al., 2017). Comparative studies 529 showed that PMMoV occurred at higher concentration than AdV, AiV and PyV in surface water bodies l)(Betancourt et al., 2014; Hamza et al., 2011; Kuroda et al., 2015; Sassi et al., 2018). The concentration 532 of AdV and AiV (up to 10 4 gc/l) were similar in river water collected in the USA (Colorado) and Japan 533 (Betancourt et al., 2014; Hata et al., 2014; Sassi et al., 2018), whereas AdV was more prevalent than PyV in 534 river water samples collected in Spain (76% vs 48% detection rates), the UK (Wales: 88% vs 65%), Japan 535 (61% vs 11%) and Germany (79% vs 59%) (Albinana-Gimenez et al., 2009; Farkas et al., 2018a; Haramoto et 536 al., 2010; Jurzik et al., 2010; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015). However, detection rates and concentrations of AdV and 537 JCV were similar in highly polluted rivers close to the wastewater discharge points near Barcelona, Spain 538 (100%, 10 3 -10 4 gc/l) and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (100%, 10 2 -10 5 gc/l) (Calgua et al., 2013). Taken together, our 539 analysis shows that these indicator viruses are present in wastewater-polluted surface freshwater at high 540 concentrations, which enables the accurate detection of the viruses and the comparative analysis of the Bacteroides (up to 10 5 pfu/l). FRNAP-II concentrations correlated with AdV concentrations in river water in 545 France (Ogorzaly et al., 2009) and with AdV, norovirus, astrovirus and rotavirus in tropical freshwater 546 samples in Singapore (Vergara et al., 2015). To date, no comparative studies have been done to compare 547 enteric viruses and phages infecting Bacteroides spp. in surface freshwater. More research is essential on 548 the prevalence of culturable human gut associated phages to assess their usefulness as indicators. freshwater environments, similar viral indicator trends have been observed in coastal waters where 551",

CrAssphage, PMMoV and AdV 558 and PyV are usually present up to 4 log 10 higher concentrations in seawater than hepatitis A virus, norovirus 559 and sapovirus (Dias et al., 2018; Farkas et al., 2018b; Fongaro et al., 2015; Moresco et al., 2012; Rusi\u00f1ol et 560 al., 2015; Symonds et al., 2018), however, one study found that the concentration of indicators and 561 norovirus GII, rotavirus and sapovirus were similar, approx. 10 4 gc/l, in seawater collected at the Tahiti 562 coast (Kaas et al., 2018). BacGB124P, BacRYC2056P and BacGA17P were also found in seawater at 563 concentrations up to 10 4 pfu/l (Olalemi et al., 2016), however, these concentrations were not compared 564 with enteric viruses. To date, FRNAP-II/III concentrations have not been measured in seawater samples. 565 Based on the data reviewed here, PMMoV, crAssphage and AdV are suitable markers for studies have evaluated the concentration of enteric viruses and viral indicators in groundwater. AdV, JCV, AiV, PMMoV, BacGB124P and BacARABA84P were detected in polluted groundwater in the USA 570 (Arizona and Colorado) and Vietnam at very low concentrations (Albinana-Gimenez et al., 2009; Betancourt 571 et al., 2014; Kuroda et al., 2015), hence the concentrations cannot be compared (Figure2; Table 2). Future 572 studies may include the efficient concentration of high volumes (> 100 l) of groundwater to accurately 573 determine viral concentrations and the associated risks. 574 3.5.4 Persistence of indicators in water 575 Understanding how long pathogenic and indicator viruses survive in the environment is crucial for accurate 576 risk assessment and management. The mechanisms and factors influencing viral decay, such as virus type, 577 temperature, microbial activity, pH, water type/conductivity, UV/sunlight radiation and the presence of 578 solid/organic matter, have been assessed (Jin and Flury, 2002; Rze\u017cutka and Cook, 2004; Verbyla and 579 Mihelcic, 2015). Many studies have shown that enteric viruses are more stable in the aquatic environment 580 than traditional indicators, such as coliform bacteria and coliphages (El-Senousy et al., 2014; Fattal et al., 581 1983; Keswick et al., 1982; Muscillo et al., 2008; Ogorzaly et al., 2010; Wait and Sobsey, 2001). 582 FRNAP are easily cultured, and their persistence in surface waters has been studied in both surface 583 freshwaters and seawater (Hata et al., 2016; Muniesa et al., 2009; Ravva and Sarreal, 2016; Yang and 584 Griffiths, 2013). In general, FRNAP-I has been found to be the most persistent followed by FRNAP-II, FRNAP-585 III and then FRNAP-IV. Using simulated sunlight, Flannery et al. (2013 b) studied the effect of solar radiation 586 on the persistence of FRNAP-II and norovirus in seawater. The reductions in RT-qPCR detectable viruses 587 was similar for norovirus and FRNAP-II under both summer and winter sunlight conditions. However, it took 588 between 81% and 88% longer for a 90% reduction in RT-qPCR detectable FRNAP-II than for infectious 589 FRNAP-II. This highlights again the need to consider infectivity when studying viral persistence in the 590 environment. Brion et al. (2002) also studied the survival of different FRNAP genogroups in surface water.Due to its easy molecular detection and relatively straightforward in vitro culturing, the survival of AdV has 596 also been well-studied. AdVs have shown 1-2 log 10 reduction in infectivity in raw and sterilised groundwater 597 and surface water over 120-180 days(Ogorzaly et al., 2010;Rigotto et al., 2011). In seawater, the decrease 598 of viral infectivity was more rapid than in groundwater, with 1.2-1.4 log 10 AdV reductions in 28 days 599 (Enriquez et al., 1995) and sunlight significantly enhancing degradation at a rate of at least 2 log 10 reduction 600 per day (Liang et al., 2017). AdVs were more stable in groundwater and surface water than poliovirus, 601 rotavirus and hepatitis A virus (El-Senousy et al., 2014; Enriquez et al., 1995). Ogorzaly et al. (2010) showed 602 that AdV persists for longer in ground water than both MS2 (FRNAP-I) and GA phages (FRNAP-II). This 603 difference in survival and persistence was greatly increased with an increase in temperature from 4\u00b0C to 604 20\u00b0C. These studies highlight the stability of AdV compared to other viruses, however, these studies were 605 conducted in laboratory experiments and the viral stability may differ in field conditions. 606 PyV has also been shown to be as resistant to sunlight in seawater as AdV (Ahmed et al., 2019b; Liang et al., 607 2017), however, the monitoring experiments detailed in Section 3.5.2 suggest that PyV degrades in water 608 more rapidly than AdV. In contrast, crAssphage proved to be as persistent as AdV and PyV in coastal 609 bathing water (Ahmed et al., 2019b). The temporal decay of AiV, PMMoV and culturable bacteriophages 610 infecting Bacteroides is not yet known and should be investigated and compared with AdV decay to 611 determine their usefulness as indicators. The comparison of the mechanisms of decay of PMMoV and the 612 other viral indicators would be especially interesting due to the differences in the structure of the indicator viruses reviewed here have been detected in environmental waters, wastewater or 616 stool samples of individuals in Asia, Europe, Australia, Africa and the Americas, highlighting the global 617 distribution of these viruses (Cinek et al., 2018; Fratini et al., 2014; Friedman et al., 2009; Guido et al., 2016;",

            "text": ". To date, none of these viruses have been studied in 624 water from Antarctica, where they could point towards contamination of pristine areas by research 625 scientists, or long-distance dispersal. 626 During long-term monitoring surveys, in the Katsura River to the west of Kyoto, Japan, FRNAP-II was shown 627 to have very limited seasonality, with similar levels in the winter and summer months (Hata et al., 2016). 628 However, in a tributary of the Uji River to the South of Kyoto, FRNAP-II was detected only during winter. 629 FRNAP-III was also found to be more prevalent during winter at both sites, a trend also observed in effluent 630 from Johkasou effluent by Setiyawan et al. (2013). Culturable phages infecting Bacteroides showed no 631 seasonal changes in their concentration in river water in the UK (Ebdon et al., 2007) and in wastewater 632 collected in seven US states (McMinn et al., 2014) and in Brazil (Prado et al., 2018). 633 In the studies reviewed, crAssphage, AdV and PyV showed no seasonal changes in concentrations in 634 untreated and treated wastewater, river and seawater samples (Carducci and Verani, 2013; Farkas et al., 635 2018a, 2018b; Fumian et al., 2013; Iaconelli et al., 2017; Masclaux et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2015; Rusi\u00f1ol et 636 al., 2015; Schmitz et al., 2016). AiV and PMMoV also showed stable titres in treated and untreated 637 wastewater over a year (Iaconelli et al., 2016; Kitajima et al., 2014; Myrmel et al., 2015; Schmitz et al., 638 2016), however, peak concentrations for AiV were noted in wastewater in Japan during winter and spring 639 (Kitajima et al., 2013). PMMoV showed no seasonality in river water either (Haramoto et al., 2013; Rosario 640 et al., 2009). Higher AdV concentrations were observed in treated wastewater collected in Wales during 641 summer than in winter and spring, which was most likely due to dry weather and a transient increase in 642 population due to tourism in the summer months (Farkas et al., 2018b). Furthermore, higher AdV 643 concentrations were detected in untreated wastewater in Norway during January-March compared to the higher during autumn-winter than during the spring-summer in wastewater collected in Egypt (Elmahdy et 646 al., 2019). Similarly, AdVs were detected at low concentrations during the summer and autumn months in 647 river water samples collected in Japan and in Germany, respectively (Hamza et al., 2009b; Kishida et al., 648 2012), probably due to dry weather conditions. Overall, these findings suggest that the indicators are 649 detectable and quantifiable throughout the year, which enables the continuous evaluation of wastewater 650 contamination. The current data imply that precipitation has more effect on viral loads than temporal 651 changes in the number of infections. Nonetheless, this should be further investigated by comparing 652 epidemiological data, viral loads in wastewater and precipitation over several years. 653 In terms of fine-scale temporal variability, the effect of rainfall on virus concentrations in surface water is 654 variable. On one hand, a decrease in virus concentrations in surface water has been reported due to 655 dilution of the water body (Gr\u00f8ndahl-Rosado et al., 2014b). In contrast, a number of studies have shown 656 association between precipitation and elevated enteric viral concentrations in water (Ebdon et al., 2007; 657 Wicki et al., 2015). In regions with combined sewers, much of this increase in contamination is likely due to 658 the additional wastewater input via CSOs and storm water drainage. 659 CSOs discharge largely untreated (screened, partially settled or untreated) wastewater into the 660 environment. This almost certainly results in higher numbers of enteric viruses being discharged into 661 receiving waters than would otherwise be the case from fully treated sewage effluents (Fong et al., 2010; 662 Hata et al., 2014). Furthermore, relatively few CSOs have spill duration monitoring and almost none have 663 microbiological or chemical monitoring requirements. Therefore, in most cases the input of contamination 664 can only be monitored via the surveillance of wastewater-derived contaminants in water bodies. 665",

            "text": ", however, MC PyV is also 332 found in wastewater and in wastewater-contaminated water (Di Bonito et al., 2014; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015). highly human-specific and have not been found to associate with animal diseases. The JC and BK strain 335 have not been found in animal waste (McQuaig et al., 2009), whereas to date, animal waste samples have 336 not been tested for human AiV. 337 PMMoV has been found at high concentrations in domestic wastewater (raw and treated) and in 338 wastewater-polluted environments and shown to correlate well with other human markers (Bacteriodes 339 HF183, PyV) (Kitajima et al., 2018b; Symonds et al., 2018, 2016) implying it associates with human waste. 340 Nonetheless, the primary source of the virus are bell and chilli peppers, with the suggestion that it should 341 not be used as a faecal indicator nearby to commercial pepper plant production areas. qPCR assays 342 targeting PMMoV show high sensitivity, however, the viruses were also detected in avian, bovine and dog 343 faeces at low concentrations (Gyawali et al., 2019a; Hamza et al., 2011; Rosario et al., 2009) suggesting that 344 animals may also access pepper as a food source. Furthermore, it has been suggested that PMMoV is more 345 abundant in faeces and in wastewater where more pepper products are consumed (Symonds et al., 2018), 346 therefore the prevalence of PMMoV should be further investigated. 347 Coliphages are commonly used as indicators for faecal viral contamination in water (McMinn et al., 2017). 348 FRNAP genogroups II and III (FRNAP-II and FRNAP-III) have been shown to be associated with human 349 sources, while genogroups I and IV (FRNAP-I and FRNAP-IV) are generally associated with non-human 350 sources (Lee et al., 2011; Stewart-Pullaro et al., 2006). For this reason, several studies have used methods 351 (described in Section 3.1) to distinguish between FRNAP genogroups to determine faecal sources. However, 352 while there does appear to be a general association between genogroups and faecal sources, the bacterial 353 host (E. coli expressing F-pili) is not source-specific and there is often overlap between source types for 354 each genogroup (Cole et al., 2003; Harwood et al., 2013). 355 Bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides, common human gut bacteria, have also shown potential as indicators 356 for faecal contamination in the environment. The most commonly used strains, which are phages that 357 infect Bacteroides BG-124 (BacBG124P), RYC-2056 (BacRYC2056P), GA-17 (BacGA17P) and ARABA-84 different methods used for detection. The viral infectivity rate (i.e. gc: infective units) of virus may be as 412 high as 1000:1 as determined for AdV (Hewitt et al., 2011), however, the actual infectivity rates for 413",
