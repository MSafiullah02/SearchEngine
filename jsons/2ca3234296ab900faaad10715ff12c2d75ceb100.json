            "text": "The new Honorary Treasurer, Professor Stephen Tomlinson, thanked the retiring Treasurer, Dr P.J. Watkins, for his stewardship of the Association's financial affairs, and said that the accounts were in a very healthy state. The income from the Oxford University Press had increased substantially from \u00a315,127.15 in 1991 to \u00a327,112.00 in 1992 and to \u00a330,927.00 in 1993. As a result of the increase in subscription rate, the total value of subscriptions had increased from \u00a39,181.50 in 1992 to \u00a313,749.91 in 1993. The Annual General Meeting at University College, London had shown a profit and this had produced an accumulated surplus for the ACM of \u00a37,211.16. The Treasurer was pleased to report a VAT refund of \u00a39,438 and the Accountants had informed him that the Association might be able to reclaim VAT on certain expenses incurred since 1990, dependent upon the relevant VAT rules. There had been no significant increase in expenditure; it was noted that the sum available for the exchange scheme with developing countries was still not being spent on a year-on-year basis; the 1993 expenditure being \u00a313,873.46 (against an agreed sum of \u00a320,000). On the basis of income and expenditure outlined above, the surplus had increased from \u00a317,395.38 in 1992 to \u00a346,518.73 in 1993. It was proposed to have a formal audit of the accounts on an annual basis. Furthermore, the Accountants had suggested that the Honorary Secretary may need to become the Membership Secretary in addition to comply with the Charity Commission regulations and would advise further on this.",

The Treasurer also noted a cash sum of \u00a337,025.77 in the Current Account (compared with \u00a317,832.35 in 1992) which was considerably more than was needed; he would be discussing with the Accountants how to make best use of this account. In reviewing the accounts, the Treasurer observed that the accumulated surplus had now increased from \u00a3225,360.73 to \u00a3269,247.97 in the last year. He suggested that even if the full allocation of \u00a320,000 per annum were to be spent on the links with developing countries, the Association could still afford (subject to annual review) to spend an additional \u00a320,000 per annum. Discussion then followed on how this might best be achieved and the President agreed that a number of suggestions that had already been raised would be discussed at the next Executive Committee Meeting.",

Coeliac disease represents an autodestructive response to certain dietary cereals, probably mediated by T-lymphocyte driven immunological activation within the gastrointestinal tract. Studies performed in vitro have implicated both the N-terminal and far C-terminal domains of one of the wheat prolamins, agregable (A)-gliadin. Consequently, and following the results of lymphocyte transformation assays using gliadin-sensitive T-clones isolated from a patient with coeliac disease, we synthesized three 19-mer peptides corresponding to amino acids 3-21, 31-49 and 202-220 of wheat A-gliadin. Four treated coeliac patients were challenged on separate occasions by intraduodenal infusion of 1 g of unfractionated gliadin and 200 mg of the synthetic peptides, the latter in random order. Jejunal biopsies were taken before and hourly for six hours after the infusions. Morphometric variables were assessed in the biopsies.",

The C-terminal peptide 202-220 may contain an epitope to which coeliac patients display variable sensitivity. The oligopeptide corresponding to amino acids 31-49 of A-gliadin is recognized by a T-cell clone restricted by the coeliac disease associated HLA-DQ2 heterodimer, suggesting that the observed effects may be due to immune activation within the intestinal mucosa. Increased vascular permeability is an important early event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the vascular changes of diabetes mellitus and malignant hypertension. Angiotensin II (All) increases vascular permeability, an action which has been attributed to All-induced changes in vascular tone. We have cloned a 204 base cDNA for human vascular permeability factor (VPF), a 42 kDa dimeric glycoprotein that dramatically increases endothelial permeability. Northern blot analysis of RNA from human vascular smooth muscle cells showed that VPF (4.2 kb) is strongly expressed by cultured vascular smooth muscle. The present study thus examined the effect of All on VPF gene expression by human vascular smooth muscle cells. All (10~7 M) induced a 9-fold increase in steady state VPF mRNA levels in vascular smooth muscle cells. The All-induced increase in VPF expression was time-dependent; maximal after 3 h and diminished by 24 h. Increased VPF gene expression was also All-concentration dependent, maximal at [All] 10~7M. All-induced VPF gene expression was inhibited by the specific All receptor antagonist Losartan, suggesting that this is an All type I receptor-mediated event These results uniquely demonstrate a novel action of All on human vascular smooth muscle which may be of considerable pathophysiological importance. All-induced increases in VPF expression provide a mechanism whereby All could powerfully influence vascular endothelial permeability independent of changes in haemodynamics. ",

We looked for CTL activity against these peptides in a group of long-term commercial sex workers with HLA B35, who are currently HIV seronegative and PCR-negative for HIV-1 and HIV-2. In three out of six women, high levels of specific CTL activity were observed against one or more of the peptides. CTL were not detected by this method in a control group of people with HLA B35 at low risk of HIV infection. We believe that HIV-specific CTL activity in these highly exposed but apparently uninfected women may represent protective immunity to HIV generated in response to repeated exposure. The sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS) causes daytime sleepiness and increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and road accidents in 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women (Young, New EngJ Med 1993; 328:1230-5). SAHS results from recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep, but it is unclear why many patients develop this problem. Case reports suggesting a familial tendency could reflect familial obesity. We have thus investigated whether SAHS runs in families independent of obesity. In an uncontrolled pilot study, we found frequent irregular breathing during sleep in first-degree relatives of thin SAHS patients (Douglas, Thorax 1993; 48:719-21). We have now performed a controlled study comparing SAHS symptoms, overnight breathing and sleep patterns and upper airway dimensions in 51 first-degree relatives of 'thin' SAHS patients (BMK30kg/m 2 ) and 51 normal subjects, obtained from a CP register, matched 1 -for-1 for age, sex, height and weight. All data was scored by an observer blinded to subject category. More relatives reported snoring (p<0.001) and sleepiness (p<0.01). Twenty-three relatives versus three controls had > 15 apnoeas + hypopnoeas/h slept (p<0.0001), and overall relatives had more irregular breathing (p<0.0001), sleep disruption (p<0.01) and oxygen desaturation (p<0.05). The relatives had narrower upper airways (p<0.01) due to retroposed maxillae and mandibles (p<0.0001). This study shows a strong familial tendency in SAHS, probably due to inherited abnormalities of facial structure. Having established a SCID-hu lymphoma model and demonstrated sensitivity of the cells to BCL-2 antisense oligonucleotides, three groups of 10 mice with lymphoma were treated with the same antisense oligonucleotide as well as sense and nonsense oligonucleotides. These were administered as a constant subcutaneous infusion pump over a 14-day period, at a dose of 100mg daily. At 28 days the sense, nonsense and untreated cell SCID mice had developed lymphoma as determined by histological examination, PCR analysis of the t(14;18) translocation and FACS analysis. However, by the same criteria the antisense-treated group failed to develop lymphoma. Examination of brain, endocrine and Gl organs showed no adverse toxicity. These findings demonstrate in vivo efficacy of BCL-2 antisense. The application of this form of treatment as part of the management of t(14;18) bearing lymphoma may be a possibility. To define the epidemiology of an outbreak of tuberculosis, the clinician needs a method to track infection by a particular strain of M. tuberculosis. We have used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and probing for the IS6110 DNA sequence, which we have found previously to be a marker for tuberculosis {Thorax 1992; 7:198-206), to investigate an epidemic of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis occurring over 24 months in Blackburn. A common RFLP pattern was observed in all isolates resistant to isoniaziad and streptomycin but not in an isolate resistant to isoniaziad alone or drugsensitive strains, confirming that the multi-drugresistant epidemic shared a single source. To develop an epidemiological tool which could be used without prior culture, we have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a variable region of a 2 kb element present upstream of the Kat C gene in M. tuberculosis. In 105 different clinical isolates, the fragment sizes were ~1000bp, ~700bp, 527 bp, 500bp, ~400 bp, and 0 bp, with a frequency distribution of 3, 30, 50, 18, 4, and 6. It was also possible to type the M. tuberculosis directly by PCR amplification of DNA extracted from sputum. This method of typing M. tuberculosis into one of six subtypes, which can be performed directly upon extracts of clinical samples, should prove useful in epidemiological studies of tuberculosis. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are mitogenic polypeptides which stimulate cellular proliferation and differentiation. The functions of IGFs are modulated by a family of specific high-affinity binding proteins (IGFBP1-6) in a complex and sophisticated system. IGFBP-1 is antagonistic to the insulin-like and growth promoting effects of IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 holds IGFs in the circulation by associating with IGFs and an acid-labile subunit to form a ternary complex. In certain pathophysiological situations, binding proteins are cleaved by specific proteases with resultant altered binding capacity and affinity, possibly increasing the availability of unbound IGFs with resultant enhancement of biological activity.",

Recent hypotheses suggest that fetal growth retardation may result in increased risk from a number of disease in later life including insulin resistance. Elevation of IGFBP-1 and 2 is reported in animal models of diabetes, and it is not unreasonable to postulate that 'reprogramming' of endocrine axes in utero with persistent postnatal elevations of IGFBP-1 and 2 may be important in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in later life.

            "text": "Two features of experimental transplantation tolerance are (i) the prolonged residence of an allograft induces profound T cell non-responsiveness; and (ii) tolerance is actively maintained, and can be transferred by T cells from a tolerant to a naive recipient. We have examined whether T cell tolerance occurs in clinical transplant recipients, and dissected the mechanisms leading to and maintaining such non-responsiveness. In 11/19 patients whose renal transplants failed after more than two years, but not in 7 patients whose grafts failed after less than six months, the precursor frequencies of alloreactive T cells against the transplant donor DR types were 2-10 fold lower (undetectable, i.e. <1:10 6 , in six patients) than those against third party DR antigens. This suggests that, as in rodents, a kidney allograft can, itself, induce T cell tolerance. Furthermore, presentation of antigen by renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro induced specific nonresponsiveness in 3 of 3 human Tcell clones, corresponding to the induction of tolerance observed in vivo. Finally, anergic T cells were shown to be potent antigen-specific suppressor cells, causing 90-96% inhibition of the proliferation of responsive T cells. The inhibition was not due to cytotoxicity of T cells and was not mediated by IL4, IL10 or TGF/? as demonstrated by the addition of cytokine or anticytokine antibodies. The inhibition was due to competition, by the anergic cells for the APC surface, and for locally produced interleukin-2. Based on these results, strategies may be designed to induce Tcell non-responsiveness in vivo. Furthermore, the generation of a cohort of non-responsive T cells may have profound immunoregulatory effects. Endothelial damage is an early event in atherogenesis. We have used high resolution ultrasound to study endothelial function in children and young adults with risk factors for vascular disease. Superficial femoral artery and brachial artery diameters were measured at rest and during reactive hyperaemia (increased flow causing endothelial dependent dilatation) and responses were compared to those after sublingual nitroglycerin (producing dilatation independent of endothelial function) in >850 subjects. The accuracy and reproducibility of this non-invasive technique have been established in phantom and serial clinical studies.",

In the latter, flow-mediated dilatation was inversely correlated with LP(a) levels but not with other lipid fractions. Interaction between risk factors was examined in 500 clinically well non-hypertensive subjects aged 5-73 years, including 179 current and former smokers. On multivariate analysis, reduced flowmediated dilatation was related to cigarette smoking / older age, male gender and larger vessel size but also independently to a composite risk factor score suggesting risk factor interaction. Cholesterol level was significantly related to flow mediated dilatation in non-and light smokers only: in heavier smokers flow-mediated dilatation was impaired whatever the cholesterol level. Furthermore, light and moderate smoking was more damaging in subjects in the highest compared to the lowest cholesterol quartile. This non-invasive method for the study of arterial, endothelial and smooth muscle function will permit prospective evaluation of the impact of interventions on early arterial wall damage at a stage of the disease process when it is most likely to be modifiable.

The further finding that RCF levels are responsive to plasma B 12 levels in cases only, could, we suggest, form the basis of a routine diagnostic test to identify this dysfunction i.e., B 12 treatment should raise RCF in cases but not in controls. This abnormality demonstrated in the mother probably also exists in affected children, i.e. maternal RCF response to B 12 is a mirror of events at the foetal neural crest. The IgC autoantibody nephritic factor (NeF) leads to complement activation via the alternative pathway in vivo, and is associated with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis and/or partial lipodystrophy (PLD). Adipocytes produce factor D, a key component of the alternative pathway. We tested the effects of NeF-containing sera on adipocytes in vitro, and analysed factor D expression in human adipose tissue by Northern blotting.",

            "text": "CMTX1 has been localized to the pericentromeric region of the X-chromosome, and has recently been shown, in a study of fifteen families, to be flanked by markers DXS106 and DXS559, a distance of approximately 2-3 Mb. Contained within this interval is the gene connexin 32 (locus designated GJ/?1). This gene encodes a membrane-bound, possibly, gap-junction protein, which is expressed in large quantities within the liver and a range of other mammalian tissues. We have sequenced the coding region of exon 2 of this gene from affected individuals in twelve families with the clinical features of CMTX1 and have found mutations which segregate with the disease in eleven of these families. The mutations detected include missense point mutations at codons 15, 40, 56, 60, 63, 208 and 215, a three base pair deletion which can be predicted to result in the loss of a single amino acid, a nonsense mutation at codon 220 and the deletion of one base in codon 72/73 producing a stop codon 12 codons down stream (the latter two presumably resulting in nonfunctional connexin). These findings are consistent with the disease CMTX1 being the result of mutations affecting the gene connexin 32 (Cx 32). While most asthma in children and young adults is associated with allergic airway inflammation, acute exacerbations appear to follow from upper respiratory tract infection. Novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for human Rhinovirus (HRV) and Coronavirus, in conjunction with conventional viro-logy, were applied to nasal aspirates collected over 13 months from 108 9-11-year-old children with a history of recurrent wheeze and cough. Viruses were associated with 85% of episodes of wheezing and decreases in peak expiratory flow (PEF); the most frequently identified virus was HRV (61% of episodes). During asymptomatic periods, virus was identified in 3-12% of subjects. Strong time trend correlations were observed between hospital admissions for asthma and viral identifications (r = 0.72, p=0.0001). An experimental infection programme employing HRV serotype 16 in 22 adult volunteers yielded symptomatic colds associated with significant decreases in PEF (30% of cases) and increased airway responsiveness (p=0.04). Severity of colds, as reflected by symptom scores and nasal wash albumin levels, were amplified in atopic individuals (p= 0.01) and fibreoptic bronchoscopic appearances suggested spread of mucosal infection to the level of the carina. The presence of virus in nasal epithelial cells could be demonstrated employing in situ hybridization, but immunohistochemistry of nasal mucosal biopsies failed to reveal any inflammatory changes. In the same subjects there was significant infiltration of the bronchial submucosa with T-lymphocytes (both CD4 + and CD8 + ) during a cold (p = 0.05) and this was accompanied by an influx of eosinophils (p = 0.03). Cellular changes normalized at convalescence (p = 0.02) except for persistence of eosinophils in the asthmatic subgroup. These observations indicate that Rhinoviruses are a major cause of exacerbations of asthma and that infection causes selective recruitment of immunocompetent cells, not to the nose but rather to the lower airways. This may reflect a lymphocyteorchestrated eosinophil-mediated inflammation of the bronchial mucosa. Ethiopia remains the endemic focus for louseborne relapsing fever (LBRF), caused by Borrelia recurrentis spirochaetes, once pandemic in Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Untreated mortality has exceeded 50% in some epidemics, but while antimicrobial treatment is effective in eliminating spirochaetaemia and preventing relapses, it is associated with a life-threatening Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction (J-HR) resembling the classical endotoxin reaction. The J-HR is associated with an explosive release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6 and IL-8. A randomized double-blind controlled trial of a new ovine polyclonal Fab fragment anti-TNF antibody was carried out in 49 patients with LBRF in Addis Ababa. For 30 minutes before they were treated with intramuscular penicillin, patients were given intravenous infusions of either specific anti-TNF Fab (20 patients), control Fab (19) or isotonic saline (10). The latter two groups were entirely similar and so were analysed together as controls. J-HRs, clinically evident as rigors, were observed in 10/21 given specific Fab compared with 26/29 controls (p<0.01). Rigors and other symptoms were far less intense and prolonged in the 10 specific Fab-treated patients who suffered J-HRs than in the 26 controls. Clearance of spirochaetes and the maximum decrease in peripheral leucocyte count was similar in the two groups. Compared with control groups the maximum rises in temperature, pulse rate, systolic BP and respiratory rate during the J-HR in the first eight hours after penicillin treatment were significantly less in the anti-TNF-treated group (p<0.01, <0.0001, <0.01, <0.05, respectively). Plasma concentrations of TNFa, IL-6 and IL-8 were measured by immunoassay. In control patients levels of all three cytokines increased markedly following penicillin. After infusion of anti-TNF Fab, peak levels (between 0-8 h), for TNFa, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly reduced compared with the controls (p<0.0001, <0.001 and <0.0001, respectively). IL-1/? was also measured but there was no significant difference between the groups. This is the first convincing demonstration in human disease that anti-TNF antibodies can suppress cytokine levels and ameliorate some of the pathophysiological effects of TNF. Abetalipoproteinaemia (ABL) is an inherited disorder of lipoprotein production. Virtually no apolipoprotein (apo)-B-containing lipoproteins are secreted from liver or intestinal cells. Malabsorption of the vitamin E occurs and can lead to retinal and spinocerebellar degeneration. Biochemical studies have implicated a defect in a gene encoding a 97 kDa microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). To investigate the role of MTP in ABL we have characterized human MTP cDNA and genomic clones. We have identified mutations in the MTP gene that specify premature termination of the protein in eight apparently unrelated persons with ABL. MTP shows extensive amino acid sequence homology to the lipovitellin complex (LV). The polypeptides of the complex are derived from vitellogenin precursors, the major egg yolk protein of egg-laying animals. X-ray crystallographic studies have established that the LV complex contains a large lipid storage cavity which is lined on two sides with antiparallel fisheets encircled by a large a-helical domain arranged in a two layer super-helical fashion. The intron/exon organization of the MTP and vitellogenin genes is highly conserved in the region encoding the ahelical domain of LV1, but not in the region encoding the ^-pleated sheets. MTP is sufficient to confer lipoprotein secretion on heterologous cells transfected with apoB and MTP. Lipoproteins are not secreted from cells contransfected with apoB alone, suggesting that MTP is the only tissue-specific component, other than apoB, which is uniquely required for the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins in vivo. These comparative structural and expression studies, and identification of mutations in the MTP gene should shed light on the mechanism of action of MTP and establish it as a major control for atherogenic lipoprotein production. Recent advances in understanding of the role played by vascular endothelium in inflammatory responses have highlighted the importance of inducible endothelial cell (EC) adhesion molecules which participate in the recruitment of leukocytes into the tissues. E-selectin is a vascular EC-specific adhesion molecule for leukocytes which is not found on unstimulated EC but is expressed following EC activation by cytokines such as interleukin-1 or tumour necrosis factor. Using intravenously injected indium-labelled anti-E-selectin mAb 1.2B6 it is possible to specifically and precisely quantify E-selectin expression in vivo in the pig. We have now evaluated the imaging potential of mAb 1.2B6 in both phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-and urate crystal-induced monoarthritis. Whereas the accumulation of ni indium-labelled control IgG in synovium and draining deep inguinal lymph nodes of PHA-injected knees was, respectively, 2.7+J.2 and 1.2+0.3 (mean + SD, n = 3) times that in tissues from control contralateral tissues, the comparable ratios in animals receiving ni indium-labelled mAb 1.2B6 were significantly greater at 13.3+5.6 (p<0.05, Student's t test) and 8.5+2.9 (p<0.05) (mean + SD, n = 3). Scintigraphy showed obvious mAb 1.2B6 localization in the inflamed knees and activated draining regional lymph nodes. We found that mAb 1.2B6 F(ab') 2 fragments gave a higher inflamed knee/contralateral non-inflamed knee localization ratio (26.8 + 16.6, n = 3) and better scintigraphic images of E-selectin expression compared to the whole molecule, due to faster blood clearance resulting in higher signal-tobackground ratios. Images obtained with mAb 1.2B6 F(ab') 2 fragments were also superior to those obtained with simultaneously injected \" m technetium-labelled neutrophils, largely because of non-specific uptake of neutrophils into bone marrow surrounding the knees bilaterally. These preclinical studies suggest that imaging E-selectin expression may provide a useful and novel technique for the localization and quantification of vascular endothelial activation in patients with inflammatory disorders.",

In vitro and in vivo suppression of B-cell lymphoma with BCL-2 antisense oligonucleotides. The majority of follicular lymphomas (85%) and some high grade lymphomas (25%) are associated with the t(14;18) translocation. This results in a deregulation of the BCL-2 gene and a failure of programmed cell death (apoptosis). A SCID-hu Bcell lymphoma mouse model was established by intravenous inoculation of 10 x 10 6 cells from a cell line (DoHH2) derived spontaneously from a patient with B-cell lymphoma bearing the t(14;18) translocation. An excess of BCL-2 expression was observed. The mice consistently developed lymphoma with the same t(14;18) translocation. In vitro treatment of the cell line with antisense oligonucleotides to the first open reading frame of the BCL-2 gene resulted in down regulation of BCL-2 expression and the induction of apoptotic cell death. However, treatment of the cell line in a similar manner with sense or nonsense oligonucleotides failed to suppress lymphoma.",
