Specifically, this approach has shed light on many conundrums by considering the networked structure of contacts, their time-varying and multilayer character, as well as the recurrent nature of mobility patterns [4\u20138]. Vaccination, whenever possible, is the most effective way to harness and prevent the spreading of a disease [9]. Under normal circumstances, the decision of getting vaccinated can be considered as an act of cooperation, since it bestows benefits on the whole population at the expenses of single individuals. Notwithstanding, we are recently witnessing the emergence of widespread antivaccine movements, which are mainly fueled by misconceptions and mischievous news about vaccines [10\u201316]. Scientists (including physicists) are devoting tremendous efforts in designing efficient immunization strategies [17] as well as shedding light on the mechanisms behind the deliberate decision of not getting vaccinated and their harmful consequences [18,19].",

Under such premises, the evolution of vaccines' voluntary adoption can be investigated using the machinery of game theory [20,21] and statistical physics [22,23]. The first studies carried out on vaccination games use classical game theory, with single round games in which agents have perfect knowledge of their odds to get infected [24,25]. In reality, however, individuals are not perfectly aware of the risk to get infected, and vaccination coverage may evolve in time as a byproduct of personal experiences or imitation. Therefore, evolutionary game theory is the natural workbench to tackle the problem. The seminal works in this direction assumed the simultaneous evolution of vaccination and spreading dynamics [26\u201328]. A different approach was used in the case of seasonal influenza, by considering that the spreading process reaches its stationary state before vaccination games take place [29\u201332].",

Our model captures the essence of previous approaches to gauge, analytically, the risk of epidemic outbreaks. In particular, we use a minimal evolutionary vaccination game to infer the strategies adopted before an epidemic season. This, in turns, allows us to estimate the risk of future outbreaks by encapsulating agents' strategies into an epidemic model. We get analytical results and insightful conclusions from the analysis of this framework in well-mixed populations. More specifically, we unveil how the interplay between the probability of infection, vaccine effectiveness, and cost, gives rise to nonlinear responses in vaccine uptake. Our analysis reveals a nonmonotonic behavior on the vaccination coverage which, surprisingly, increases as the vaccine quality deteriorates. Such counterintuitive behavior is analyzed and understood from stability principles of the proposed mathematical model.",

As effectiveness decreases, the risk for a not vaccinated agent of getting infected by a previously vaccinated one becomes yeff\u00d7\u03b2\u03b1\u03b3. Conversely, the risk of a vaccinated agent to get infected by a nonvaccinated becomes (1\u2212yeff)\u00d7\u03b2\u03b1\u03b3. Comparing these two risks, the vaccinated agent has an advantage over the nonvaccinated if yeff>(1\u2212yeff), which translates into yeff>0.5. Hence, the counterintuitive act of vaccinating when the efficiency of the vaccine is low turns out to be a rational decision to mitigate the infection pressure. Moreover, the existence\u2014for each infectivity \u03b2\u2014of a maximum fraction of vaccinated agents, ymax*, delimitates a region of \u201ctolerable effectiveness\u201d beyond which agents decide to non vaccinate. Also, the position of ymax* versus \u03b2 splits the phase space into two distinct regions (Fig. 2 inset). Interestingly, this effect has been observed previously in other coevolutionary models [31\u201333], but never explained hitherto. At variance with y, the fraction of effectively vaccinated agents, yeff, is always lowered by a decrease of the vaccine quality, i.e., d[(1\u2212\u03b3)y*]d\u03b3<0. Therefore, the higher vaccination coverage is not counterbalancing the lower vaccine quality. Let us analyze this dependency more in detail.",

Albeit appearing irrational and counterintuitive at first sight, such behavior is\u2014instead\u2014due to the interplay between the vaccination game and the disease spreading processes. The model predicts also that highly infective\u2014but under control\u2014epidemics might prove dangerous for future infections, since they alter the \u201crisk perception\u201d of the agents and induce them to nonvaccination. Finally, as mentioned in the introduction, the timescale between the two dynamics (decision and spreading) has always been considered fixed. The sole exception, up to our knowledge, are childhood diseases with long term immunity [27,34]. The framework presented here could be used to fill the gap among different model formulations and unify them.",
