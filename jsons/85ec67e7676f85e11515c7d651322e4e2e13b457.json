The sudden shutdown of services and lockdown of people are predisposing to such conditions particularly when dealing with the unpredictable status of the outbreak. The fear of getting the disease and losing loved ones [26] is another predisposing factor that may result in such a condition. The prevalence rate of moderate-to-severe depression symptoms in this study seems to be considerably higher than that of those reported by the Chinese study that included 1210 respondents during the COVID-19 outbreak (16.5%) whereas comparable rates for anxiety were noted (28.8%) [3] . Also, it was observed that results vary according to the sample size and the used assessment tool. Where in another nationwide study among Chinese people during the pandemic including 52,730 participants revealed a psychological distress prevalence rate of 35% among all respondents.

Such results aligned with the percentage of infected cases among the two groups, where, the data showed a pattern in terms of who is more likely to become infected with the new coronavirus. Recent reports showed that among confirmed cases, Saudis account for 19% of total cases while other nationalities account for 81%. These results could be attributed to the status of most non-Saudis in terms of occupation, and residence status. A substantial number of foreign workers are in the labour force who live in heavily crowded areas that in most of it lack the needed social distancing requirements [28] . Previous studies reported that foreign workers experienced the highest level of distress among all occupations. Reasons such as worrying about exposure to coronavirus in public transportation when commuting to and from work, delays in work time, job security, and consequent deprivation of their salary may explain the high-stress level [27] . Such results mandate the government to take and re-enforce specific measures to control the increase of infected cases.",

Further, the prevalence rate was high in the younger age group which, is in agreement with our study as a higher score of depression was associated with individuals younger than 29 years.

Second, the study employed validated tools for the assessment of depression and anxiety that enhanced the reliability of the study. Third, it involved a good sample size that was not limited to specific geographical areas in Saudi Arabia. However, this study has several limitations. First, the study was based on a web-based survey method, then some vulnerable individuals who have no access to the internet and are unfamiliar with online questionnaires were missed. Second, due to the sudden occurrence of the outbreak, an individual's anxiety, and depression prevalence before the outbreak could not be pursued. Third, the survey was administered at a single period and hence the stability of the responses is unknown.",
