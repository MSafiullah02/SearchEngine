In the 7-month period from Oct 1918 to Mar 1919, as many people as died as a result of the tsunami died of virus-triggered pneumonia in every country of the world each and every day, reaching a staggering total of 50 million.2, 3 In 1918, and during the next pandemic in 1957, the scientific infrastructure was still minute and, although influenza vaccines were under serious development, there were no antiviral drugs licensed to combat pandemic influenza. Given the long lead time to reformulate vaccines, it is now acknowledged that antiviral drugs will be our first defence to reduce the mortality\u2014and social and medical disruption\u2014of the first wave of the next influenza pandemic. Influenza pandemics arise and spread as a succession of waves and then settle down to cause yearly epidemics. Given the lack of both antivirals and vaccines, our forebears struggled with the global outbreaks of the past with a mixture of masks, quarantine, and social distancing. There is no evidence that this entirely sensible defence had any effect whatsoever.",

Two of the three widely recognised prerequisites for a human pandemic have been met in the avian influenza outbreak in east Asia: first, the emergence of a new influenza virus (avian influenza H5N1), to which the population has little or no immunity, and against which there is\u2014to date\u2014no effective vaccine;5 and second, its transfer to human beings with virulence. The virus is even battering its way through the final barrier\u2014passage from person to person.6 The Director General of the WHO, Lee Jong-Wook, discussed the danger of a pandemic of a new infection such as avian influenza with the WHO executive board in January, and highlighted the need to establish emergency systems for an immediate and effective response to an international health crisis. So where are we in terms of planning our response to the threat of an influenza pandemic?",

The influenza science base is strong but practical application is frighteningly feeble. Essential stocks of antivirals and vaccines are noteable by their absence. Research shows that the neuraminidase inhibitor (NI) antivirals are very effective against the human and avian H5N1 virus strains, while research into the composition of vaccines against H5N1 has led the USA to order 2 million doses, which will protect the population, at least in a small way, if the next pandemic stems from this strain.5 But what about the remaining 290 million or so citizens of the USA? How will they be protected? The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in southeast Asia and the deliberate release of anthrax in the USA have shown that modern societies do not take kindly to outbreaks of infectious disease and they are prone to panic very quickly.",

There are a number of antiviral attributes that may lend some drugs to being more appropriate than others for stockpiling. For example, the M2 ion channel inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and one of the NIs (oseltamivir) can be taken orally; however, the M2 inhibitors are more likely to be associated with the emergence and spread of drug-resistant influenza than oseltamivir. Thus, the WHO have highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate agent(s) for stockpiling as part of national pandemic plans.7\n",

We would no longer wish to be the passive audience at a macabre theatre of infection; rather, infectious disease experts, mathematicians, virologists, vaccine specialists, and chemotherapists would be thrown into the fray. The confrontation with SARS was very much like a battle. Indeed, the troops on the ground\u2014epidemiologists, nurses, and doctors\u2014died. The WHO uncovered its new power and used it to the full\u2014nations who failed to act were exposed and had travel restrictions applied. This measure rocked even countries with a firm economy.",

These plodder viruses are characterised by a low basic reproductive rate (R0)\u2014in the case of SARS, the R0 was 2, meaning that from a single case only two new cases would be expected. Together with a long incubation period of 10\u201312 days, the epidemic could be\u2014and was\u2014broken by quarantine. Surprisingly, a retrospective study of the 1918 influenza pandemic has suggested a low R0 of 3\u20134. But influenza has another vital attribute: a very short incubation period. Thus, we will not be able to rely on quarantine as a defensive measure, except as a second-line strategy. Our first defence must exploit the scientific advances of the past decades: new drugs and vaccines.",

The UK has more pandemic plans than any country, and a strong, supportive scientific and infectious disease community. But very serious decisions must be made now. The Department of Health has spearheaded discussions about the pandemic plan and supported the purchase of smallpox vaccine stocks in the unlikely event of a bioterrorism attack. But mother nature is more capricious and powerful than any bioterrorist. The coming influenza pandemic will cut huge swathes in the world community, and history would look with a jaundiced eye should governments hesitate and not join in this war, and place monetary priorities elsewhere.",
