In general, decisions for which devices, tests, medical procedures, surgical interventions, or programs of care will be used in Canadian hospitals are made based on nonsystematic consideration of a \u201cconvenience set of evidence\u201d provided by internal advocates or by industry representatives. Few hospitals have adopted an objective, systematic, dispassionate approach to assessing all relevant evidence and economic information to inform which technologies to take up and which to forgo. Despite the existence of external HTA agencies at the national and provincial level, there is still an important gap to be filled by HB-HTA to address contextual issues that are not assessed by external HTA agencies (i.e., competing priorities, local skills and infrastructures, resources, and trade-offs). Moreover, most technologies have not been formally assessed by external HTA agencies before hospitals make decisions about whether to adopt them. This chapter focuses on HB-HTA in the teaching hospitals across the city of London, Ontario [1\u20137].",

The objective of the initiative was to improve translation of evidence related to drug therapies (whether \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cestablished\u201d) into hospital policy and practice through a process of collaborative systematic review with meta-analysis of the evidence, alongside deliberative discussion about the relevance for our local setting. The evidence-based analyses and deliberative discussions were presented by teams of clinicians together with the EBPI project leader to the appropriate policy committees (usually the drug and therapeutics committee and other relevant clinical, quality, and finance committees) to inform decisions about which drugs should be taken up versus which should be abandoned from practice.Initially, new and expensive drugs were the primary focus. But, eventually, drug classes were also reviewed, for the purpose of simultaneous investment and disinvestments within drug classes. In addition, the focus was not only on assessment but also on translation into policy and practice, with evaluation of the impact post-implementation. At any time, three to nine assessment and implementation projects were in progress simultaneously, with one full-time program leader supplemented by a number of clinicians and administrators providing in-kind time.\n",

This process also allowed for a few innovative drug price negotiation strategies based on best available evidence, moving us toward evidence-based drug procurement with risk-sharing agreement for selected drug purchase contracts. The EBPI was awarded with two national recognitions: the Innovative Practitioner Award and the Pharmacy Administration Award. In addition, this program was awarded the LHSC Medical Advisory Committee Award (1999) for local impact. Some of the methods and approaches developed during the EBPI continue within our hospital today as a common thread toward assessment of drugs and technologies [1].",

HiTEC operated as an on-demand request service, to facilitate evidence synthesis and economic evaluations of drugs, devices, and other technologies to inform hospital decisions and procurement processes. In addition, we undertook collaborative projects with Medbuy (a group purchasing provider) to inform negotiations with industry for proton pump inhibitors and erythropoietics.

Depending on available resources within MEDICI, requests for assessments are accepted through a number of channels, such as through the senior leadership team including the hospital CEOs and other senior administrative leadership, or through clinical leaders including departmental chairs, and directly by physicians or other practitioners. The hospitals have gone through a number of changes in CEOs and senior leadership over the years, resulting in changes in institutional management structures and decision-maker accountabilities. As a result, we have provided HB-HTA for a number of different committees and decision-making units within the hospital in order to remain flexible based on demand and tempered by our available human resources and funding flows. At this time, decision-making for health technology uptake and disinvestment is spread across committees and decision-making structures within the London hospitals, typically organized around clinical departmental structures according to budget accountabilities. At the time of writing, there is no centralized intake process or unified decision-making process for all technology requests for the London hospitals, and we see this as an opportunity for formal research. We are currently seeking grant funding to evaluate the impact of a centralized approach using the Know4Go and IDEAL frameworks [69], both locally and in collaboration with other hospitals in Canada and abroad.",

This rapid pre-assessment allows us to telescope the depth and breadth of the review based on the likely impact of the technology in question. If the pre-assessment suggests that the payback on comprehensive assessment efforts are likely to be commensurate with the potential magnitude of impact of the technology, and if no relevant up-to-date reviews pre-exist from other HTA agencies (including the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, Health Quality Ontario, and Ontario Health Technology Assessment Committee), we perform \u201cde novo\u201d systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and meta-regressions as the first component of Know4Go. Subsequently, as needed, we determine the contextualized benefit index and local opportunity costs based potentially on local data analysis, economic modeling, sleeper analyses, and a survey of competing priorities. The comprehensiveness of the evidence, economic, sleeper analyses, and trade-off assessments depends on the question at hand, whereby high-stakes decisions receive more time and rigor than low-stakes decisions. In some cases, the evidence and/or economics is so compelling that the Know4Go and decision-making process can be truncated without performing extended analyses. The comprehensiveness and number of reviews conducted also depends on amount of human resources available within MEDICI.",

This result was not too surprising, since we had focused especially on performing evidence-based assessments and sleeper assessments for targeted high-cost drugs in 2006 and beyond. During this period, we also developed an annual request for proposals through the drug and therapeutics committee to receive requests for assessments in a coordinated fashion and to elicit sleeper issues that might not be anticipated in prior assessments. We additionally implemented a 24/7 pager system, whereby special one-off requests for non-formulary drugs could be made, which allowed a core team from the Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee to screen all such requests for approval or rejection on a case-by-case basis. This proved especially important for effective de-implementation of some high-cost drugs (i.e., aprotinin) and for preventing indiscriminate use of newer drugs. It also served as a \u201chorizon scanning\u201d device to foresee the need for upcoming assessments for drugs with increased demand through special request system.\n",

This study was a retrospective before-after study, likely with many confounders. Association does not prove \u201ccausation\u201d since many other changes were likely implemented in our hospital within the same time frame as we began developing and implementing Know4Go. In fact, our Know4Go approach to performing evidence-based assessment, costs, other implementation issues (i.e., social, legal, ethical, institutional factors), and trade-offs was a continued evolution and expansion of our earlier approach to evidence-based assessment introduced during the Evidence-Based Prescribing Initiative. As a result, our evolution since 1999 was one of progressively increasing the expectation of comprehensive evidence-based systematic reviews of the evidence. Additionally, it is important to note that Know4Go was not applied in its entirety, or with equal rigor, to all decisions. Due to our limited resources for HB-HTA, we developed a pragmatic approach to prioritizing requests using rapid assessment Know4Go and subsequently assessing subcomponents of Know4Go (at the least, evidence + economics; if pertinent, also assess sleepers and opportunity cost) to address higher-cost or higher-stake drugs more thoroughly than lower-stake and lower-cost drugs. Another concern is that the data from 2004 were incomplete, and we remain uncertain regarding the verity of the drug cost information for that year. Perhaps most importantly, the goal of HB-HTA is not primarily to impact costs. Therefore, a key limitation was that patient outcomes were not measured.",

The underlying challenge that is germane to this is the ever-present need to \u201cprove\u201d the value of the HB-HTA unit, often before gaining approval for continued annual operational funding. This constant need to \u201cprove\u201d our worth results in a dual challenge to produce HTA for the hospital proactively while also evaluating the impact of the HB-HTA program and procuring grants to provide funding to expand services and methodologies beyond the core-funded services. This constant need derives from the continual budget shortfall for hospitals in the publicly funded healthcare setting, where demand always exceeds available resources. This growing demand for technology assessments highlights the need for HB-HTA growth, and yet, HB-HTA operating funds must compete directly with direct patient care shortfalls. This is a tough competition to win, given the immediate gratification of offsetting direct patient care shortfalls relative to the more remote and longer-term sustained benefits of an HB-HTA service.",

This challenge is becoming more serious as the volume of evidence and data is growing exponentially, inducing greater efforts to complete evidence syntheses and HTAs. However, decision-makers and academic collaborators who devote in-kind time (with the hopes of publishing quickly) expect ultra-rapid or expedited systematic review timelines. This challenge is compounded by our approach to HB-HTA where multiple options and post-implementation outcomes need to be evaluated to ensure the predicted effects translated to reality in our hospital. This results in multiple layers of research across multiple topics, and insufficient time to publish all assessments in the peer-reviewed literature.

We are submitting grant requests to fund this future endeavor to develop collaborative decision-making and integrated knowledge translation for the hospital setting around the globe [2\u20133]. It is our goal to build an effective national and global network to support hospitals in decisions and KT related to health technology investment and disinvestment to enable efficient innovation and optimal healthcare, whether locally or internationally [2, 3, 78].\nIterative assessment, throughout the life cycle: Using our Know4Go Framework, we have been exploring ways to move beyond the paradigm of one-off single technology assessments, to progress to dynamic assessment of portfolios of opportunities. To better embrace the world of iterative and evolving assessments throughout the life cycle across a multitude of technologies, a number of methods will need to be further developed including pragmatic Bayesian analysis, pragmatic value-of-information analysis, dual assessment of evidence from clinical trials, along with real-world outcomes, among others.\nMachine learning and cognitive computing to automate aspects of HB-HTA: Automated efficiencies will be necessary, through technologies such as machine learning and cognitive computing, to ensure that the global evidence base can be identified, collected, synthesized, and made readily available for local contextualization, and so that evidence can be weighed against local considerations and continuous feeds of real-world local data.\nHB-HTA education and capacity building: Capacity building in HTA skills through training, workshops, and graduate courses (MSc/PhD) will need to be expanded, both in terms of numbers of trainees and also in terms of the scope of knowledge and skills developed. Such capacity-building initiatives need to be accessible both the \u201cusers\u201d and \u201cdoers\u201d of HTA.\n",
