COVID-19 primarily causes respiratory symptoms but it was also associated with gastrointestinal effects 3, 4 . The virus was genetically similar to its predecessor, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), although it had greater person-to-person transmission capacity 5 . In a very short time it spread worldwide, forcing the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the state of pandemic 6 . Many preventive measures were taken to reduce contagion, including recommendations for the use of masks and gloves, greater attention to hand hygiene, social distancing, quarantine, and lockdown of non-essential activities 7, 8 . In this context of global urgency, physicians are dealing with difficult and never experienced situations 9 .",

For this reason, we designed a survey to investigate current management of IBD patients and to define fears and difficulties that physicians were facing during the global SARSCoV-2 pandemic. A 39-question anonymous websurvey was conducted with the logistic support of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) between 20 and 30 March 2020. All ECCO members were invited to participate in this survey through collective e-mails. The questionnaire mainly consisted of multiple-choice questions while only three questions assessed the physicians' fear of infectious risk in non-IBD and IBD patients using a numerical scale from 0 to 10. We collected data on the number of positive COVID-19 cases, diagnostic approach in asymptomatic patients, discontinuation of immunosuppressive and biological drugs (Supplementary Table 1 ). We also investigated the recommendations given to patients, the preventive measures for patients and physicians (e.g. masks, gloves, goggles, and disinfectants), and any organizational changes imposed by hospitals. Physician demographics and incidence of COVID-19 among IBD patients are summarized in Supplementary were also asked to quantify (from 0 to 10) their fear that IBD and non-IBD patients could be infected with SARS-CoV-2. The average fear value was greater for IBD patients than non-IBD patients (6.58, standard deviation (SD) = 2.08 vs 5.16, SD = 2.13). It is important to underline that a high average fear value was detected for IBD patients treated with immunosuppressant drugs or biologics (7.45, SD =1.95). Finally, a quarter of physicians was optimistic about the rapid resolution of the pandemic, while 106 (18.5%) and 319 (55.9%) subjects were uncertain or not optimistic respectively. According to most of the survey participants, the coronavirus test should not be performed in asymptomatic non-IBD patients (80.5%) (Table 1) . Similarly, in IBD patients without symptoms suggestive of infection, the swab should not be performed (75.1%). In asymptomatic IBD patients treated with immunosuppressants and biologics, the test was considered unnecessary by about two thirds of physicians. On the other hand, in IBD patients with suspicious symptoms, systematic coronavirus testing was supported by 312 participants (54.6%), while the remaining half of respondents discredited this approach. Most respondents (80.1%) believed that the use of protective aids (e.g. mask, gloves) was effective in preventing viral transmission ( Table 2) . Only a small percentage of persons denied or was uncertain about their efficacy (8.6% and 11.3% respectively). Protections during an IBD patient consultation were used by three quarters of physicians and the most adopted aids were disinfectants (88.4%), masks (72.4%), gloves (56%), and goggles (9%). About a quarter of physicians did not use protections during their consultations.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 test was performed only in 40 asymptomatic subjects (7%), while the remaining physicians were not tested. Most physicians (87%) received information from their center regarding the management of COVID-19 patients, while only 74 respondents (13%) were not given indications ( Table 2 ). Three quarters of physicians were satisfied with the recommendations received, while a low percentage of persons was unsatisfied or uncertain (19.3% and 8.1% respectively). As for treatment, most physicians (72.5%) thought they knew how to properly manage patients with suspicious symptoms of COVID-19, while few subjects were uncertain (14.5%) or believed they did not know how to manage appropriately COVID-19 patients (13%). Most respondents believed that IBD were not associated with an increased risk of infection (54.4%), while a significant group of physicians speculated that immunosuppressive and biological drugs could be a predisposing factor of infection (67.7%). Accordingly, the fear that IBD patients could be infected with SARS-CoV2 was greater than the fear for non-IBD patients and this data was further emphasized in IBD patients receiving IBD drugs. Physicians' fears of being infected with the new coronavirus and of infecting patients were common (57.7% and 81.8%). In addition, a significant percentage of people (30.3%) reported fear of dying from COVID-19. Most of the respondents (73.7%) reported being stressed by the pandemic situation and 35.6% of the physicians declared they worked more than the standard number of hours. These results are in line with a cross-sectional study assessing the mental health burden of Chinese health-care workers 11 . The majority of workers (75%) were stressed and professionals personally involved in diagnosis, treatment, and care of COVID-19 patients had a greater risk of psychological burden 11 . From the diagnostic point of view, common opinion was not to perform the test for coronavirus in asymptomatic subjects regardless of IBD or immunosuppressive treatment. On the other hand, only a small number of physicians had been tested (7%). Preventive measures were not adopted by all respondents during their consultations and although extensive use of disinfectants and masks, gloves and goggles were used less frequently. These data should be underlined in light of the high rate of health care personnel recently diagnosed with COVID-19 12, 13 . Moreover, the increasing evidence of fecal-oral transmission of the virus suggests the need to implement the use of gloves and goggles 14, 15 . It is also interesting to note that although the use of protective aids was considered important to prevent infection, a high percentage of physicians did not recommend the use of protective aids for IBD patients during their daily life (47%). Interestingly, only a small group of physicians stopped immunosuppressive or biological treatments (9.6%) and the most discontinued drugs were thiopurines, steroids, and anti-TNFs (72.7%, 43.6% and 30.9%). In a recent study conducted in an IBD center in Wuhan, all IBD treatments were stopped 16 . Over a period of about two months, no IBD patient was infected with the new coronavirus and drug discontinuation was suggested as a viable option to reduce the risk of infection 16 . On the other hand, in an Italian study 17 , 522 IBD patients were continuously treated with biological and immunosuppressive therapies and no case of infection was found after more than one month of follow up. Long-term data are needed to define which is the best strategy. Importantly, stopping therapy exposes patients to a greater risk of disease recurrence and therefore this decision should be individualized 18, 19 . In fact, the International Organization of IBD (IOIBD) has recommended discontinuing immunomodulators (thiopurine and methotrexate) and tofacitinib in positive SARS-CoV2 patients and all therapies systematically in patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 20 . In the remaining cases, the decision should be made by the physician, in agreement with the patient, based on the risk / benefit ratio of each patient. As regards the work organization, most of the consultations were rescheduled and the start of new biological therapies was frequently postponed.",

Protective aids (e.g. masks, gloves) for IBD patients during their daily life were recommended in 309 cases (53%), while in 274 cases (47%) they were not(Table 2). Similarly, quarantine was suggested by about half of physicians (48.2%), while the remaining respondents (51.8%) did not propose it. A common recommendation was to avoid travel (95.9%), while only few physicians (9.6%) stopped IBD drugs as preventative strategy. Thediscontinued drugs were thiopurines (72.7%), steroids (43.6%), anti-TNFs (30.9%), methotrexate (20%), ustekinumab and tofacitinib (20% each), vedolizumab (3.6 %), and other (1.8%). Additional recommendations were provided by 210 physicians (36.8%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey investigating physicians' fears and the management of IBD patients in the context of many uncertainties regarding COVID-19 pandemic. More than five hundred persons participated in our study providing information from all continents. Most physicians worked in small IBD centers (39.9%) and in a few hospitals there were confirmed cases of IBD patients with COVID-19 at the time of the survey (10.4%). COVID-19 was generally considered more severe than flu (76.5%) and the possibility of further transmission ways beyond the respiratory one was a common idea (79.1%).",

The high number of physicians from different countries, who participated in the survey, is the main strength of our work, suggesting that the data are reliable and representative of clinical practice.However, some relevant limitations must be reported. Firstly, a significant percentage of subjects did not answer all the questions, and this could be a bias for results' interpretation. Secondly, the results of this survey represent a photograph of a specific time period. As new information are acquired every day, many responses given by physicians may have changed over time. For this reason, it would be necessary to re-propose the survey after some time in order to evaluate how physicians' concerns and management of IBD patients change with the progress of COVID-19",

            "text": "Eight hundred thirteen physicians from 72 countries in the world responded to the survey and more than two thirds of participants answered all the questions. The number of answers varied according to the queries. Most respondents (253, 39.9%) worked in small IBD centers (1-500 patients), while the number of hospitals managing 501-1000, 1001-2000, and > 2000 patients was superimposable (146 (23%), 117 (18,5%), and 118 (18.6%) respectively). Confirmed cases of COVID-19 among IBD patients were detected by 66 physicians (10.4%) and there were mostly few cases (1-10) per center (58/66, 87.9%). Eight people (12.1%) reported 11-50 cases diagnosed in their hospital and none had more than 50 infected IBD patients. Three quarters of the subjects (470, 76.5%) believed that COVID-19 was more severe than flu, while a minority of participants disagreed or were uncertain (12.2% and 11.3% respectively) (Table 1). Respiratory transmission was considered the only transmission way by 68/614 persons (11.1%), while other sources of infection were thought possible for the majority of respondents (79.1%). Interestingly, the transmission of COVID-19 infection from an asymptomatic subject was a possible option for most physicians (580, 94.5%), while only a small percentage disagreed or was doubtful about it (1.8% and 3.7% respectively). In addition, 334 respondents (54.4%) stated that IBD patients were not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19, while for the other respondents it was uncertain or possible (30.5% and 15.1% respectively). On the other hand, IBD drugs were recognized as predisposing factors for COVID-19 in 161 cases (26.2%). This hypothesis was \"likely\" for additional 255 subjects (41.5%), while 119 (19.4%) and 79 (12.9%) physicians disagreed or were uncertain. Most physicians (73.7%) reported feeling stressed by COVID-19 pandemic(Table 1). An increase in the number of working hours was reported by a third of persons, while in 61.6% of cases there was no difference compared to standard working hours. Most respondents were afraid of being infected (349, 57.7%) and infecting patients (494, 81.8%). Physical contact with other people was feared by about half of respondents (45.1%), while the remaining persons (51%) did not report this fear. Many physicians (40.6%) were worried about being quarantined, but quarantine was considered important for preventing contagion by almost all persons (93.8%). Moreover, a relevant number of physicians reported being afraid of dying from COVID-19 (30.3%), although most people did not have this fear (61.4%). Physicians",
