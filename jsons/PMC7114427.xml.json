One of the most widespread membrane modifications caused by +RNA viruses results in the formation of paired membranes, i.e. two closely apposed lipid bilayers. A growing body of evidence, presented in Table 1\nindicates that the paired membrane structures are induced by the expression of viral proteins \u2013 most typically by parts of the viral replicase. Table 1 lists the virus lineages for which there is evidence that some form of virus-induced paired-membrane structure is associated with viral replication. The wide distribution of membrane pairing in +RNA viruses suggests that this is an effective strategy for successfully producing new viruses, and that membrane pairing may somehow increase the competitive fitness of these viruses.",

However, there are several lines of experimental and genetic evidence that suggest that RNA synthesis is tied to the formation of replicative organelles. Viral RNA accumulates in the coronavirus organelles, suggesting that the organelles may be a site of RNA synthesis (Knoops et al., 2008, Knoops et al., 2012, Gosert et al., 2002, Hagemeijer et al., 2012). Furthermore, viral organelles are not formed when RNA synthesis is stopped (Stokes et al., 2010, Verheije et al., 2008). While it is clear that RNA synthesis is linked with the organelles, it has proved difficult to directly test whether or to what extent the process of organelle formation is necessary for the process of RNA synthesis, because of the practical difficulty in separating the two processes in an experimental setting.",

The nidoviruses that have been studied to date all induced a combination of paired-membrane features, the precise function of which have not been elucidated. It is also important to point out that to some extent the distinctions between paired membrane structures are open to interpretation and may only be fully accessible when three-dimensional imaging methods are used. A catalog of the virus-induced membrane structures that have been observed for each coronavirus is shown at right in Fig. 1\n.",

Nidoviruses, and most particularly coronaviruses, are highly genetically variable and contain several genus-specific or even species-specific genes (Lauber et al., 2013). However, there are two clusters of genes that are conserved in all known nidoviruses (Angelini et al., 2014, Lauber et al., 2013). The first is a highly conserved cluster of genes homologous to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp3-6 (Fig. 1). Expression of the membrane-anchored proteins nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 is sufficient to induce the formation of SARS-like paired-membrane replicative organelles (Angelini et al., 2013). The second conserved gene cluster encodes the viral RNA polymerase and superfamily 1 helicase (Deng et al., 2014). The conservation of membrane-pairing genes in the context of an otherwise hypervariable group of viruses is a strong argument in favor of the importance of at least the membrane-pairing genes for RNA synthesis",

Mutations in the first non-hydrophobic domain of TM2, which is the largest part of the coronavirus replicase to localize on the luminal face of the membrane, have been demonstrated to disrupt RNA replication and may cause defects in membrane pairing (Gadlage et al., 2010). Deletion of the latter conserved domain of TM2, which has been structurally solved (Manolaridis et al., 2009, Xu et al., 2009b), was surprisingly well tolerated (Manolaridis et al., 2009, Sparks et al., 2007). TM2 localizes to membranes, but does not induce any recognizable change to intracellular membranes in the absence of other viral proteins (Angelini et al., 2013). However, co-expression of TM2 with full-length TM1 results in extensive pairing of perinuclear membranes in both coronavirus (Angelini et al., 2013) and arterivirus (Snijder et al., 2001, Posthuma et al., 2008). Additionally, it has recently been shown that co-expression of a fragment of MHV TM1 including the transmembrane region and the C-terminus with TM2 induced ER membrane zippering and curvature similar to the phenotype observed after SARS-CoV TM1 and TM2 co-expression (Hagemeijer et al., 2014). In that report TM1 and TM2 were demonstrated to interact via protein loops on the luminal face of the membrane.",

Overexpression of TM3 alone disturbs intracellular membrane trafficking (Cottam et al., 2011, Cottam et al., 2014), resulting in an accumulation of single-membrane vesicles around the microtubule organization complex (Angelini et al., 2013). However, quantitative electron microscopy revealed that expression of TM2 with TM3 prevents the membrane disruption seen with TM3 expression alone (Angelini et al., 2013). When SARS-CoV TM1, TM2 and TM3 are coexpressed, membrane-containing bodies which resembled authentic SARS-CoV replicative organelles were formed. However, in each of the cell sections where DMV-like membranes were observed, the membrane proliferation phenotype of TM1, the paired membrane phenotype of TM1 + TM2 and the single membrane vesicle accumulation from TM3 were each visible, suggesting that these proteins do not always colocalize efficiently when expressed from plasmids in different parts of the cell instead of being expressed in the natural form as a polyprotein (BWN, personal communication). This suggests that while TM3 is not necessary for membrane pairing, TM3 may be necessary to induce the formation of the double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that are characteristic of coronavirus replicative organelles.",

DMO membranes were initially suggested to derive from the early secretory pathway, although the absence of conventional ER, ERGIC and Golgi protein markers on viral replicative membranes argues against this hypothesis (Verheije et al., 2008, Knoops et al., 2010). Since DMVs are reminiscent of the double-membranes of autophagosomes, several lines of controversial evidence hypothesized a diversion of Atg (autophagy-related) proteins and autophagosome function during coronavirus replication, as it is the case for other +RNA viruses (Prentice et al., 2004, Snijder et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2007, Maier and Britton, 2012, Richards and Jackson, 2013). The involvement of autophagy was recently investigated in the context of the avian CoV Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) infections (Cottam et al., 2011). The authors conclude that the presence of exogenous, individually expressed IBV nsp6, which localizes to the ER, induces the formation of autophagosomes in contrast to other IBV replicase proteins. Additionally, although autophagosomes induced by IBV nsp6 or IBV infection appeared smaller than conventional autophagosomes observed after starvation of cells, they were similar in size to DMVs (Cottam et al., 2014). However, the data reported here do not appear to support the assumption that there is a functional link between IBV nsp6 and autophagosomes, and a role of the autophagy in the formation of IBV replicative structures can hereby not be demonstrated. Moreover, neither induction nor inhibition of autophagy seems to affect IBV replication (Maier et al., 2013b). It also has to be noted that the induction of autophagy by virus infection is cell type and possibly species dependent, as exemplified by the absence of LC3 puncta accumulation in IBV-infected primary chick kidney cells (Maier et al., 2013b).",

            "text": "New evidence concerning the source of membranes for CoV-induced DMOs was proposed, in which Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) probably co-opts a cellular degradation pathway of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) regulators, known as the ERAD tuning pathway (Reggiori et al., 2010). The ERAD pathway is responsible for the turnover of folding-defective polypeptides in the ER and is modulated by stress-inducible positive regulators of ERAD-mediated protein disposal such as EDEM1 (ER degradation-enhancing alpha mannosidase-like 1) and OS-9 (osteosarcoma amplified 9). The latter assist in transporting misfolded proteins into the cytosol for subsequent degradation by the proteasomal system. Under physiological conditions, however, low concentrations of EDEM1 and OS-9 are maintained in the ER lumen in order to avoid premature degradation of proteins that are undergoing folding programs (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008). In this case, EDEM1 and OS-9 are selectively confined by interacting with the transmembrane-anchored cargo receptor SEL1L (suppressor of lin-12-like protein 1) and later released from the ER lumen in small short-lived vesicles, called EDEMosomes, which rapidly fuse with the endolysosomal compartments (Bernasconi et al., 2012). This steady-state disposal of EDEM1 and OS-9 is known as ERAD tuning pathway. While not relying on the coat protein complex II (COPII) or Atg7, it critically depends on the non-lipidated form of LC3 (LC3-I), which is recruited to EDEMosomes. However, the specific autophagosomal marker GFP-LC3 does not associate with EDEMosomes, which are therefore distinct structures (Noack et al., 2014).",

Moreover, replication of MHV, which does not require an intact autophagy pathway, is impaired upon knockdown of LC3 or SEL1L (Bernasconi et al., 2012). DMOs furthermore lack conventional ER markers and do not associate with GFP-LC3 (Reggiori et al., 2010).

Recently, investigations of the even more distantly-related Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, revealed that it may usurp the same components of the ERAD-tuning pathway as well (Sharma et al., 2014). Consistent with this hypothesis, both viruses were shown to replicate independently of a functional autophagy pathway. The non-lipidated LC3 marker protein, which is essential for the replication of EAV and JEV, associated with their replication complexes together with EDEM1 whereas GFP-LC3 did not label these structures.

Indeed, IBV's recently described spherules derived from paired ER membranes significantly differ from the DMO structures observed upon alpha- and beta-coronaviruses infections (Maier et al., 2013a, Neuman, 2013) and their generation might require a different set of factors. Furthermore, the morphology of DMOs induced by flaviviruses such as Hepatitis C Virus, Dengue virus or West Nile Virus is highly heterogeneous and the identification of a common, conserved membrane diversion strategy seems unlikely (Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014).

Similarly, LC3 and EDEM1 were not recruited to rearranged membranes induced by co-expression of MHV TM1 and TM2 (Hagemeijer et al., 2014). While this still has to be proven in the context of CoV TM1, TM2 and TM3 expression, it raises the questions whether LC3 participates to the biological function of DMVs rather than its generation. A novel hypothesis has been recently suggested for Poliovirus, according to which the virus might not only co-opt a host pathway, but also divert the functional network of individual proteins (Belov and Sztul, 2014). Host factors could therefore have a proviral function during infection, distinct from the function for which they have been initially described. Accordingly, this is reminiscent with novel functions attributed to LC3 during cellular homeostasis, cytoprotection against invading pathogens or during Chlamydia trachomatis\u2019 intracellular life cycle (Bestebroer et al., 2013).",

The resistant viruses released similar amounts of new progeny compared to wt, but produced only about half as many DMVs per infected cell. In addition, the DMVs induced by resistance mutants appeared structurally impaired. Similarly to MHV nsp4 mutants (Gadlage et al., 2010), K22 escape mutants induced DMV with partially collapsed inner membranes, even when K22 was not present. However, it is important to bear in mind that the fixation, staining and imaging conditions may have an influence on the appearance of membrane structures (Knoops et al., 2012). Moreover, the specific infectivity of those newly released virions was about tenfold lower for TM3 mutants than for wt. This suggested that the mutations in nsp6 conferred resistance to K22 at a cost of impairing an early intracellular step in the establishment of infection.",

One of the viruses with increased fitness compared to wild-type was the N-methyltransferase mutant Brts105, which produced only half as many DMVs as wt.

In this interpretation, DMOs could still play an obligate role in viral replication under specific conditions or in specific cell types, but the primary role for DMOs would be to increase the efficiency of either RNA production, delivery of newly synthesized RNA to sites where it could be translated or packaged, and/or shielding abundantly synthesized viral RNA from host cell innate immune sensing pathways. These studies also suggest that at least half of the DMVs present in infected cells may be in excess of what is strictly needed to sustain normal levels of RNA synthesis, given that both MHV and HCoV-229E mutants replicated normally despite producing only half the normal complement of DMVs.",

From this work we can hypothesize that other MHV ts mutants, or K22-resistant HCoV-229E mutants with replicase defects would probably make either smaller or fewer DMVs, and a larger collection of such mutants will like be highly informative to further our understanding on the pivotal role(s) of DMOs in the coronavirus life cycle. Hopefully the unique insight provided by these results, together with the relative ease of analysis will make quantitative electron microscopy a routine part of the characterization of new virus mutants. In addition, the accumulated knowledge on the nature of coronavirus DMOs and the possibility to experimentally interfere with DMO formation by using small compound inhibitors, such as K22, will allow us to dissect similarities and differences between viral DMOs and related cellular organelles.",

Some of these questions could be addressed by developing methods to study active replicase complexes and DMO membranes in vitro. There are also larger questions about the common ground in terms of membrane rearrangement and host response between coronavirus replicative organelles and those of other virus families. For now, it is clear that RNA viruses induce a variety of membrane structures that appear to have a common goal: efficiently producing progeny in the environment of an infected cell. We hope that future studies will be able to simplify this apparent complexity by separating the necessary, advantageous and dispensable components of DMO structure and function.",
