            "text": "Infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) has a negative\u2010sense non\u2010segmented RNA genome, and belongs to the genus Novirhabdovirus, in the family Rhabdoviridae. Viral genomic RNA acts as a direct template for the RNA synthesis events of transcription and replication. In the process of transcription six monocistronic mRNAs are synthesized, which are then translated into individual proteins. In the process of replication, a full\u2010length positive\u2010strand replicative intermediate RNA is synthesized and this becomes the template for the production of progeny genomic RNAs. \u2018Antigenomic\u2019 RNA refers in this paper to both mRNA and replicative intermediate RNA. The major distinguishing feature of Novirhabdovirus is the presence of a non\u2010virion gene between the glycoprotein and the polymerase genes (Kurath, Higman & Bjorklund 1997). The six genes of IHNV are present in the genome in the following order: 3\u2032\u2010N\u2010P(M1)\u2010M(M2)\u2010G\u2010NV\u2010L\u20105\u2032, where N is the nucleocapsid protein, P or M1 is the phosphoprotein, M or M2 is the matrix protein, G is the glycoprotein, NV is the non\u2010virion protein, and L is the polymerase protein (Kurath, Ahern, Pearson & Leong 1985; Morzunov, Winton & Nichol 1995).",

            "text": "Originally enzootic on the west coast of North America, IHNV has been spread by movement of infected fish and eggs to Asia and to Europe, where it has become widely established among populations of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum). IHNV is an economically important fish pathogen, causing severe acute infections in young salmonid fish and resulting in high mortalities. Depending upon the species of fish, strain of the virus, and environmental conditions, outbreaks of IHNV may result in losses of 80\u2013100% when young fish are infected. Once clinical signs become apparent, the disease is usually irreversible and fatal. Following a disease outbreak, surviving fish may become virus carriers without showing obvious signs (Kim, Dummer, Chiou & Leong 1999). Presently, the only control measure for the spread of IHNV is by destruction of infected stocks. Although effective DNA vaccines to IHNV have been developed and tested under laboratory conditions (Anderson, Mourich, Fahrenkrug, LaPatra, Shepherd & Leong 1996; Alonso, Johnson, Simon & Leong 2003), these are not yet commercially available. The requirements for low cost, ease of application and safety have restricted their commercial development for aquaculture. Such issues will need to be addressed before large\u2010scale application of DNA vaccines on fish farms is adopted. However, taking into consideration aspects of safety and ease of administration, antiviral agents may be a more feasible approach to the control of IHNV infection and disease.",

            "text": "Sequence\u2010specific oligomers designed to inactivate selected messenger RNAs (the sense strands) are commonly called \u2018antisense\u2019 oligos. Antisense oligomers of various structural types have been used to inhibit the gene expression of several viral pathogens (Ma, Rede, Naqvi & Cook 2000). The first antisense compound to receive FDA approval for use in humans, a therapeutic for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, targets the IE\u20102 gene of CMV (Green, Roh, Pippin & Drebin 2000). Antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are a new class of antisense agents with high specificity and efficacy (Stein, Foster, Huang, Weller & Summerton 1997; Summerton, Stein, Huang, Matthews, Weller & Partridge 1997; Schmajuk, Sierakowska & Kole 1999). They contain purine or pyrimidine bases attached to a backbone composed of 6\u2010member morpholine rings joined by phosphordiamidate inter\u2010subunit linkages and are usually synthesized to be 20\u201325 subunits long. PMO are sequence\u2010specific, uncharged, water soluble and nuclease resistant (Hudziak, Barofsky, Barofsky, Weller, Huang & Weller 1996; Summerton & Weller 1997). PMO bind to RNA by Watson\u2010Crick base pairing, and can prevent translation by steric blocking of translation initiation with minimal toxicity (Stein et al. 1997; Ghosh, Stein, Weller & Iversen 2000). Regions of mRNA sequence that are likely to be effective targets for PMO antisense agents can be predicted with relative ease and usually involve either RNA splice sites or the region comprising the 5\u2032\u2010untranslated region, AUG translational start codon and the first 20 or so bases of protein coding sequence (Stein et al. 1997; Giles, Spiller, Clark & Tidd 1999; Ghosh et al. 2000). PMO have demonstrated efficacious, specific, and non\u2010toxic reduction of target protein levels in a number of tissue cultures (Arora, Knapp, Smith, Statdfield, Stein, Reddy, Weller & Iversen 2000; Hudziak, Summerton, Weller & Iversen 2000; Nasevicius & Ekker 2000; Kipshidze, Kim, Iversen, Yazdi, Bhargava, New, Mehran, Tio, Haudenschild, Dangas, Stone, Iyer, Roubin, Leon & Moses 2002). Further, these studies have established PMOs as essentially non\u2010toxic agents with favourable pharmacokinetic properties (Iversen, Arora, Acker, Mason & Devi 2003). PMOs have demonstrated the ability to inhibit replication of vesivirus (a calicivirus) (Stein, Skilling, Iversen & Smith 2001), and mouse hepatitis virus (a coronavirus) (Neuman, Stein, Kroeker, Paulino, Moulton, Iversen & Buchmeier 2004). The goals of this study were to determine whether efficient and non\u2010toxic delivery of PMO into fish cells and tissues is possible, and if so, whether replication of IHNV could be inhibited by PMO complementary to either antigenomic or genomic RNA.",

            "text": "The PMOs were synthesized at AVI BioPharma (Corvallis, OR, USA) as previously described (Summerton & Weller 1997). The chemical structure of the PMO backbone is shown in Fig. 1a. Purity of full\u2010length oligomers was >95% as determined by reverse\u2010phase high\u2010pressure liquid chromatography and MALDI TOF mass spectroscopy. Membrane\u2010penetrating peptide was covalently conjugated to the 5\u2032 end of the PMO with the cross\u2010linker N\u2010[\u03b3\u2010maleimidobutyryloxy] succinimide ester (Moulton, Hase, Smith & Iversen 2003). The conjugated peptides used in this study were designated as P002 (RRRQRRKKRC) (Moulton et al. 2003) and P003 (RRRRRRRRRFFC) (Moulton, Nelson, Hatlevig, Reddy & Iversen 2004). Both peptides were custom synthesized by Global Peptide Services (Fort Collins, CO, USA) and purified to >90% purity. Details of the conjugation process and purification of peptide\u2010conjugated PMOs has been previously described (2003, 2004). Table 1 and Fig. 1b show the nomenclature, sequences and targeting locations in the IHNV genome of the PMOs used in this study. PMOs were designed to target the AUG translation initiation regions of the N and G genes of the Round Butte 1 (RB1) isolate of IHNV (GenBank accession numbers U50401 and U50402, respectively). As the RB1 isolate of IHNV has not been completely sequenced, a PMO to target the L gene translation\u2010initiation region was designed according to the sequence reported for the IHNV WRAC isolate (GenBank accession no. L40883). An additional compound (P003\u2010L 3\u2032 PMO) was designed to hybridize to sequence near the 5\u2032\u2010terminus of the IHNV negative\u2010strand genomic RNA. The four PMOs described above were conjugated to P003 peptide. G and L translation\u2010initiation region PMO, without P003 peptide conjugation, were also prepared. A scrambled\u2010sequence version of the P003\u2010N PMO and a second irrelevant sequence control compound were also synthesized and conjugated to P003 peptide in an identical manner as the antisense compounds, to serve as controls for any generic non\u2010sequence\u2010specific activity of the P003\u2010PMO chemistry. In order to permit analysis of the uptake of PMO forms into fish cell lines by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry, carboxyfluorescein was conjugated to the 3\u2032\u2010end of a random\u2010sequence PMO (PMO\u2010FITC). The same fluorescein\u2010tagged random sequence PMO was also 5\u2032\u2010conjugated to P002 peptide (P002\u2010PMO\u2010FITC) and P003 peptide (P003\u2010PMO\u2010FITC). All the lyophilized PMOs used in this study were dissolved in sterile water prior to use in culture cells.",

Two fish cell lines were evaluated, epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells (Fijan 1983) and a Chinook salmon embryonic cell line (CHSE\u2010214) (Lannan, Winton & Fryer 1984), in order to investigate cell\u2010to\u2010cell variation. The EPC cell line was obtained from Dr Sara Perez (Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Spain) and the CHSE\u2010214 cells from the ATCC. To investigate the ability of PMO to inhibit IHNV infection, CHSE\u2010214 cells were grown in duplicate 6\u2010well plates at 17 \u00b0C in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mm\nl\u2010glutamine. Prior to treatment with PMO compounds, confluent cell monolayers were rinsed twice with RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mm\nl\u2010glutamine. Following the removal of the second rinse, 2 mL of RPMI\u201010% FBS containing an appropriate PMO or corresponding volume of dH2O was added. Cells and medium were then incubated overnight at 17 \u00b0C. The next day, log dilutions of IHNV (RB1 isolate) in MEM\u20102% FBS (200 \u03bcL per well) were added. After 1 h of adsorption at 15 \u00b0C, virus inoculum was removed and quantification of virus was performed by plaque assay following the method of Burke & Mulcahy (1980). After 10 days of incubation at 15 \u00b0C to allow IHNV plaque formation, the monolayers were fixed and stained with a crystal violet solution [0.25% crystal violet, 10% ethanol and 2% formaldehyde in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS)] for 48 h, and the number of plaque\u2010forming units were scored. CHSE\u2010214 cells infected with log dilutions of IHNV but receiving mock treatment with water only, as well as PMO\u2010treated cells without IHNV infection, were included as controls.",

(Fig. 3b) resulting in approximately a 20\u2010 and 13\u2010fold, respectively, increase in uptake over cells treated with the PMO\u2010FITC. Uptake of the P002\u2010PMO\u2010FITC into CHSE\u2010214 and EPC cells was less compared with the P003 conjugate but still 15\u2010 and 8\u2010fold, respectively, more than PMO\u2010FITC. These results confirmed the differential delivery of PMO to the two cell lines and demonstrate the considerable PMO delivery\u2010enhancing capacity of both peptides.",

PMOs complementary to viral genomic or antigenomic RNA were tested for their ability to inhibit IHNV amplification in cell culture. The effect of the PMOs on the titre of IHNV in CHSE\u2010214 cells is shown in Fig. 4a,b. A simple average percentage inhibition is presented for ease of comparison. Several other similar experimental trials were conducted that yielded results consistent with those of Fig. 4. For the experiment reported, PMOs were added to CHSE\u2010214 cell cultures at a final concentration of 15 \u03bc\nm in RPMI\u201010% FBS. Significant inhibition of viral titre was observed with the P003\u2010L PMO (Fig. 4a; lane 2), P003\u2010L 3\u2032 PMO (Fig. 4a; lane 3) and P003\u2010N PMO (Fig. 4b; lane 7); with 49, 54 and 64% inhibition, respectively. P003\u2010G PMO failed to show a large effect on the IHNV viral replication (23.3% inhibition) (Fig. 4a; lane 1). PMO\u2010G and PMO\u2010L (both non\u2010peptide\u2010conjugated) were also used to further assess the contribution of P003 peptide to cellular delivery. No effect on viral replication was observed with any of the non\u2010peptide conjugated PMOs (Fig. 4a; lanes 4\u20136). Furthermore, IHNV growth was not inhibited by the P003\u2010N Scramble PMO (Fig. 4b; lane 8) or by the P003\u2010irrelevant sequence PMO (Fig. 4b; lane 9), suggesting a lack of cytotoxicity by this form of peptide\u2010conjugated PMO compound under the conditions tested, and indicating that that the IHNV antisense P003\u2010PMOs used in the study were specific.",

The data showed that CHSE\u2010214 cells exhibited higher levels of fluorescence than EPC cells when incubated with these compounds. Both cell lines showed individual cells with diffuse, apparently cytoplasmic signal, as well as fluorescent nuclei, indicating delivery was extensive into both major cellular compartments. The highest amount of intracellular fluorescence was observed in the P003\u2010PMO\u2010FITC treated cells. The ability of the P003 peptide to deliver PMO across biological membranes was characterized previously in HeLa cells (Moulton et al. 2004). Our results indicate that the P003 peptide also significantly enhances delivery and activity of PMO in fish cell lines.

The reduced intensity of the 67\u2010kDa G\u2010protein band on a Western blot supports the observations of reduced viral titre. This compound was designed somewhat inadvertently, but fortuitously is complementary to sequence located approximately 155\u2013175 nucleotides (nt) from the 5\u2032 terminus of the genomic (negative) strand. This location is within the L gene, the 5\u2032 end of which is at approximately 150 nt before the 5\u2032 terminus of the genomic strand. The sequence that comprises the 59 5\u2032 terminal nt of the genomic strand is known as the \u2018trailer region\u2019, and its integrity has been demonstrated as critical to proper transcription (Whelan & Wertz 1999b) and virion assembly (Whelan & Wertz 1999a) in vesicular stomatitis virus, a related rhabdovirus. Fig. 7 shows an M\u2010fold secondary structure diagram of 140 nt of IHNV genomic RNA that comprises the P003\u2010L 3\u2032 PMO binding region and surrounding sequence. This diagrammed region shows a series of stable stem loops and indicates that the P003\u2010L 3\u2032 PMO binding region is located in a region that is particularly highly ordered. The diagram shown had the highest \u0394G value for any of the predicted configuration variations offered by the folding program (data not shown). We speculate that disruption of this putative stem loop located near the 5\u2032 terminus of the genomic RNA may have contributed to the high inhibition of IHNV amplification observed. PMOs complementary to IHNV antigenomic RNA such as P003\u2010N PMO, P003\u2010G PMO or P003\u2010L PMO also showed inhibition of IHNV replication, but to a much lesser extent. Although translational arrest certainly represents an important mechanism of action for antisense drugs, our results suggest that PMO interaction with the 5\u2032 end of the viral negative strand profoundly affects IHNV replication in cell culture, and could represent a potent antiviral compound. The success of an antisense PMO probably depends, to some extent, on its molar ratio to its target RNA. It may be that the superior efficacy of the PMO with a negative\u2010strand target compared with that of a PMO with a positive\u2010strand target was due to the lower molar amount of negative\u2010strand genomic RNA target compared with the amount of positive strand targets (i.e. many mRNA molecules for a given target, in addition to full\u2010length positive\u2010strand replicative\u2010intermediate RNA). In addition, the strong antiviral effect of the genomic\u2010targeted PMO may be due, in part, to the fact that it affects viral transcription early in the viral replication cycle.",
