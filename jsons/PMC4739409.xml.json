These four disease areas, plus tuberculosis (TB), comprised five of the top eleven causes of death worldwide in 2013 (GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2014). Infectious diseases generate a large economic burden (Fonkwo, 2008) with antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the subject of a World Health Organization (WHO) action plan (World Health Organization, 2014) and a priority for the United Kingdom (UK) (Anon.,), European Commission (2011), and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Anon.,), projected to cost an estimated $100 trillion by the year 2050 if unadressed (Anon., 2014).",

The UK research funding landscape has several national and international awarding bodies that invest in pre-clinical (laboratory) science, observational studies, clinical trials, and translational research, with significant commitments to infectious disease research. Earlier research by the Research Investments in Global Health study (ResIn, www.researchinvestments.org) has systematically analysed public and philanthropic awards totalling \u00a32.6 billion to UK institutions for infectious disease from 1997 to 2010, for funding awarded by infectious disease, microbiology and type of science (Head et al., 2013), including for respiratory infectious disease research (Head et al., 2014a) and pneumonia (Head et al., 2015a), sepsis (Fitchett et al., 2014a), AMR (Head et al., 2014b), and sexually-transmitted infections (Head et al., 2015b). Tracking research and development (R&D) investments provides information and evidence to inform policy on funding decisions. We present an update to the systematic analysis of infectious disease research awarded by public and philanthropic funders to UK institutions from 2011 to 2013, and assess funding from 1997\u20132013 against global measures of mortality, DALYs and years lived with disability (YLD) across three time points.",

We excluded studies not immediately relevant to infectious disease, symposium grants, studies related to purely veterinary or plant infectious disease (but included animal health research incorporating a clear zoonotic component), research where a viral vector was used in relation to non-communicable disease, and awards that were led by a non-UK institution, but had UK collaborators. Of the studies included in the final dataset, all had a title or brief descriptor and 65.1% had either an abstract attached or further information sourced from the internet (e.g. institutional webpages, clinical trials databases).

The introduction of the cross-disciplinary category was a refinement of the previous methodology prompted by an increasing number of these types of awards (defined as an award containing significant components of a study that covers two areas along the R&D pipeline). We did not retrospectively apply this new category to the 1997\u20132010 dataset owing to resource constraints.

Burden data from 2004/05 were obtained directly from colleagues at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Washington. As defined by the GBD study, YLDs per person from a sequela are equal to the prevalence of the sequela multiplied by the disability weight for the health state associated with that sequela. YLDs for a disease or injury are the sum of the YLDs for each sequela associated with the disease or injury (Vos et al., 2012). DALYS are the product of adding YLLs and YLDs for each age\u2013sex\u2013country group (Murray et al., 2015).",

Further work to decipher the impact of predominantly UK-focused funders, such as the NIHR, and the global funding remit of the organisations such as the Wellcome Trust would also be useful.",

            "text": "There are other published analyses that have similar aims in terms of considering investment and burden. Consideration of NIH funding in 2006 suggested a modest correlation with USA disease burden from 2004, (Gillum et al., 2011) with comparable findings in analyses from Australia (Mitchell et al., 2009) and Norway (Kinge et al., 2014), showing variable correlation depending upon the chosen burden metric and whether that metric considered national or global burden. Thus, policymakers have a decision to make about the extent to which there is targeting of investment on health burdens within their own country, and how much funding targets international priorities. These decisions will be driven to an extent by the remits of existing funding agencies, plus also the existing research expertise in the UK. Disease areas such as the NTDs appear well-funded here, relative to their global disease burden, and this is may be in part due to previous and ongoing excellent performance by individuals and institutions in addressing these areas. In terms of the location of research investment activity, the UK demonstrably provides greater relative international investment in nations where there are colonial ties (Fitchett et al., 2014c). It may be that other nations also favour countries in which they have historic connections (and there are good reasons for doing so, such as a common language or infrastructure requirements); however, this may also mean that some countries are neglected in terms of receiving research investment from which they could greatly benefit.",

            "text": "Funding for infections with pandemic potential remains inconsistent and it is difficult to project accurate future burdens of new and emerging infectious diseases. The UK influenza research portfolio is now arguably relatively strong, combined with a Department of Health focus to identify research gaps and priorities in this area (Infectious Disease Research Network, 2014). The emergence of the large Ebola outbreak in West Africa over 2014 and 2015 has highlighted how little research there has been by UK institutions prior to 2014 on filoviruses; an unpublished analysis using ResIn data demonstrates that the US NIH is the only funder with a track record of sustained funding in this area. Reactive efforts across 2014 and beyond will greatly increase that total research investment; however, the examples of Ebola and novel coronaviruses with pandemic potential (Head et al., 2014a) show that there is a need for a proactive approach in terms of commissioning, capacity-strengthening and carrying out research in diseases that have potential to impact on global health security (though this area of commissioning faces significant challenges). Decisions around resource allocation for disease eradication may reflect the interests of specific donors and high-profile individuals, such as former US President Jimmy Carter and his efforts towards eradicating dracunculiasis (Guinea worm) (Hopkins et al., 2014), though most investment here would be considered implementation rather than research. In 2015, the UK government announced a high-profile implementation and research investment in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to advance knowledge against infectious diseases, particularly malaria (HM Treasury D for ID, 2015). Clearly, there are other factors beyond current and projected disease burdens that should influence decisions around research investment priorities, such as the effectiveness of available interventions, what constitutes the \u2018best buy\u2019 for a particular health service and consideration of health inequity in neglected populations (Wiseman and Mooney, 1998). There should also be reflections on what research is feasible and the likelihood of advances in knowledge if investment is targeted in specific disease or geographical areas. A checklist for health research priority setting, with the aim of achieving maximum public health benefit, has been suggested previously (Viergever et al., 2010), and the data presented here showing the relative scale of investment compared to disease burden can usefully inform the commissioning process for research that assesses how to alleviate the impact of disease on public health.",

For example, over 80% of gastroenterology research was pre-clinical in 1997\u20132010; across 2011\u20132013, less than half was pre-clinical with relatively equal sums of money for the other four phases of research. This may be the result of the previous pre-clinical research being translated into tools, products or knowledge in other areas of the research pipeline, and may have contributed to the reduction in global burden of disease observed in enteric infections in 2013. The level of investment by the private sector in new tools such as vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics for infectious diseases is important but uncertain given the low market attractiveness for these conditions which predominantly affect lower income and middle income countries, though it is plausible that investment decisions in the public, philanthropic and private sector are made as a result of some level of interaction between the sectors. There are examples of public\u2013private product development partnerships for infections such as malaria and TB, while that for maternal and child health, where there is also low market attractiveness, has been lacking (Fisk and Atun, 2008). Although there has been progress made with transparency of reporting in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries (Brown, 2013), commercial sensitivities mean that it is difficult to obtain investment data to analyse in similar detail to the awards included here.",

This will result in fluctuations in levels of funding for several infections; for example here across 1997\u20132010 and 2011\u20132013, investments for Candida proportionately increased and investments for HPV decreased The rationale for fluctuations in funding are complex, and will reflect various issues such as funder priorities, numbers of applications received by those funders, disbursement of research funds over the study period, research capacity in each topic area, and potentially the quality of burden data available.",

As described above, the lack of private sector investment information leaves a data gap. Analyses have not taken into account proportions of awards allocated to indirect or estate costs. Any distribution of funding from the lead centre to collaborating partners is also not documented. Categorisation is subjective, but checks by at least one other author reduce the impact of any observer error.
