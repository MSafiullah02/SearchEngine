The discovery of the fact that networks with fat-tailed degree distributions do not display an epidemic threshold in the asymptotic limit is a relevant example of how the connectivity pattern of interacting agents can dramatically change the course of an epidemic [2, 3] . The use of network theory in epidemiological models provides a way to incorporate the individual-level heterogeneity necessary for the mechanistic understanding of the spread of infectious disease. These characteristics are very attractive for the application of network epidemiological models in ecology on the different spatial and temporal scales.",

Ten years ago Jeger et al. [4] recognized the relatively low use of network theory for studying plant diseases. Since then, more theoretical developments have been presented in the literature. These models include the important description of the geometric constraints in which the pathogen is spreading as well as stochasticity and several sources of heterogeneity in the transmission of infection [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

The second kind of model is based on random geometric graphs (RGGs) [9] [10] [11] [12] , in which each node is randomly assigned geometric coordinates and then two nodes are connected if the (Euclidean) distance between them is smaller than or equal to a certain threshold r. Random geometric graphs have found applications to model populations which are geographically constrained in a certain region [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , which offer many valuable features over other types of random graphs [19, 20] . Brooks et al. [21] have used RGGs to model the interactions between the anther smut fungus and fire pink using temporal data that spans 7 years of field studies. They have concluded that the use of spatially explicit network models can yield important insights into how heterogeneous structure promotes the persistence of species in natural landscapes.",

            "text": "When studying the propagation of diseases in plants there is an important factor that needs to be taken into account. It is obvious that plants are not as mobile as humans and animals; thus they reach lower levels of mixing in a given population due to mobility. The immediate consequence of this lack of mobility is the fact that the shape of the plot or field in which the plants are distributed may significantly affect disease dynamics. In fact, there is both empirical and theoretical evidence that supports this hypothesis [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . In general, it has been suggested that square plots and fields favored higher spreading of plant diseases than elongated ones of the same area [22] [23] [24] [25] . We should make here some remarks about the shape of plots in different scenarios. First, we should mention the experimental plots for different crops. In those cases, the size and shape of the plots are controlled typically to estimate crop yields. Thus, they are typically of almost perfect square or rectangular shapes (see, for instance, Ref. [24] ). The second scenario is when crops are cultivated in country fields. In these cases the sizes and shapes of the fields depends on the geographical conditions of the region. However, in general these fields can be grossly approximated as rectanglelike or squarelike on the basis that they are more or less elongated. Such shapes are also thought to facilitate the mechanized work on the fields more than irregular shapes. Finally, there is a third scenario in which plants are growing naturally in a given environment. In these cases it is obvious that the distribution could be quite irregular and acquiring many different shapes. However, when studying the influence of the shape of these natural fields on the propagation of an epidemic it is typical to approximate their shapes to rectangular or square ones, as it is well illustrated for the case study of the spatial and spatiotemporal pattern analysis of coconut lethal yellowing in Mozambique [26] .",

In this case, the nodes are uniformly and independently distributed on a unit rectangle of given side lengths. Thus, we simulate plots and fields of the same size in which we can analyze the effect of elongation on epidemic spreading on plants. When both sides are of the same length we recover the RGG which accounts for squared shapes. It is worth mentioning that previous models have considered the variation of the shape for the region where the nodes are distributed in the RGG. In some of these works more general boundaries, such as right prisms and fractal regions have been considered in particular for analyzing the connectivity of the resulting RGGs [32] [33] [34] . In this work we consider a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on the RRGs to describe the propagation of a disease on a plant population on a field of varied rectangular shapes. We obtain analytical and simulation results that support the empirical observations and theoretical evidence about the fact that (ceteris paribus) elongated plots and fields decrease significantly the propagation of diseases on plants. In particular, our results show that the epidemic threshold is significantly displaced to the right with the elongation of the rectangle, which indicates that the number of infected plants necessary to produce an epidemic grows with the rectangle elongation. Finally, we stress that in classical, noninteracting systems-either homogeneous or heterogeneous-the resemblance of SIS and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemiological models translates into a strong mathematical symmetry between them that leads to identical expressions for the epidemic thresholds under mean-field approaches (i.e., when neglecting the effects of dynamical correlations). We therefore anticipate that our results will be also valid in a SIR framework, which as a matter of fact could be more relevant for plant diseases.",

The curve joining the points of this plot makes a separation between the RRGs which are connected (upper triangular part) from those which are disconnected (lower triangular part). That is, the curve represents the critical radii versus critical elongation, and it gives the critical region indicating the connectivity of the RRGs. It can be read in two different ways. You can fix a value of a and then determine which is the critical radius for which the network will be disconnected. For instance, for a rectangle with longer side a = 15 it is necessary to use a radius larger than 0.17 to make the RRGs connected. More interesting for this work is the other way around. That is, we have a fixed radius of connection, which may represent the radius of spreading of a disease among plants. Then, you can find what elongation of the rectangle disconnects the network. For instance, if the connection radius is fixed to r = 0.35 every RRG is connected for a < 30. Then, we emphasize here that we always work in the region of connected RRGs in this work. That is, any analysis carried out in this paper is based on graphs for which the connectivity of the graph is 100% guaranteed as we work in the upper triangular part of this plot. In addition, we check computationally that every RRG generated in this work is connected.",

Instead, in the SIR model, once an individual gets cured of the disease she enters the recovered compartment and cannot be infected again, that is, she acquires immunity. Both SIS and SIR dynamics are governed by two parameters, namely, the per contact infection rate \u03b2 and the recovery rate \u03bc.

The transition from the absorbing to the active phase strictly resembles a nonequilibrium secondorder phase transition in statistical physics [38, 39] . The critical value of this transition ( \u03b2 \u03bc ) c = \u03c4 is defined as the epidemic threshold. This term is also known as the basic reproduction number and it represents a threshold in the sense that when \u03c4 < 1 the infection dies out and if \u03c4 > 1 the disease becomes an epidemic. In those cases where \u03c4 = 1, the disease remains in the population becoming endemic. The value of this threshold strongly depends on the topology of the network.

That is, what is the behavior of the epidemic threshold when a \u2192 a c . In the following we prove that, when a \u2192 a c , f decreases. Consequently, the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix \u03bb 1 also decreases when a \u2192 a c , which implies that the epidemic threshold grows monotonically. Our strategy here is to prove that the increase of the rectangle elongation produces a decay of the average degree of the RRGs. Strictly speaking, proving that the average degree decreases with the elongation of the rectangle is not proof that the spectral radius also decreases. Although such proof is analytically possible, it is out of our intention of working more on the phenomenology of the process in this work. However, it is possible to indirectly infer such a relation between the elongation and the spectral radius as follows. First, it is well known in spectral graph theory that the average degree is a tight bound to the spectral radius of graphs in general. In particular, we are interested here in showing whether the average degree and the spectral radius of RRGs show the same behavior when the rectangle is elongated. In Fig. 3 we illustrate the plot of the spectral radius versus the average degree for RRGs with a = 1 [panel (a)], a = 30 [panel (b)], and a = 1, 2.5, 5, 7.7, 15, 20, 25, and 30 [panel (c) ] for different values of the connection radius. As can be seen in all cases, and particularly in the last one, the trends of the spectral radius and the average degree are exactly the same and indeed they are very highly linearly correlated. Thus, our conclusion here is that proving that the average degree has a certain behavior when the rectangle is elongated can be directly extrapolated to the behavior of the spectral radius with the elongation of the rectangle.",

Here we have kept the size of the plot or field constant by considering unit rectangles in our analysis. However, it is important to consider that other factors, such as the orientation of the plot or field, play fundamental roles in the propagation of a disease on plants. For instance, if the rectangular plots are placed perpendicular to the direction of the prevalent winds the disease will not propagate as a consequence of this factor.",

This model is appropriate for the simulation of disease spreading on plants allocated on plots and field of varied shapes. RRGs account for the spatial distribution of nodes allowing the variation of the shape of the unit square commonly used in RGGs. We have shown here by using analytical results and extensive numerical simulations of the SIS dynamics for different values of the elongation a and a fixed radius r that the elongation of the plots or fields in which the nodes (plants) are distributed makes the network more resilient to the propagation of epidemics. This is due to the fact that the epidemic threshold increases with the elongation of the rectangle. These results agree with a large accumulation of empirical evidence about the role of elongation of plots and fields on the propagation of diseases on plants. This model represents a new way to analyze disease propagation on plants or similar scenarios, by combining the heterogeneities introduced at individual levels by networks with the influence produced by the shape variation of the plots and fields where the plants are growing.",
