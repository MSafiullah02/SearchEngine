The novelty of the COVID-19 disease, lack of literature, absence of antiviral agent, and vaccine has added more uncertainty while preparing for and recovering from HSCT.",

Recipients belonging to high-risk transmission area of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection or having a close contact to a person to such areas should be tested. COVID-19 testing can be repeated if there is strong clinical suspicion for COVID-19 due to the chance of false-negative results. Multiplex PCR is recommended that allows testing for non-SARS-CoV-2 viral infections as well.If detected positive for COVID-19, the recipient should be evaluated with imaging study preferably CT chest and for the need of oxygen requirement.Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is not routinely recommended due to the risk of airborne transmission to health care workers.

As of March 20, 2020, 15 cases of COVID-19 cases in post-HSCT setting (15 allogenic and 3 autologous) have been reported from Europe. Most cases were reported from Spain (five patients) followed by Italy (three patients). The median age of the patients was 59 years, ten patients presented with upper respiratory symptoms and remaining with lower respiratory tract systems. Out of these, one patient has already succumbed to COVID-19 illness (https://ebmt.org/covid-19-and-bmt).",

Few of them could be (1) donor getting infected between clearance for donation and the actual date of the cell apheresis, or (2) harvest center staff falling sick to COVID-19 disease on the day of harvest, or (3) difficulties to transport harvested stem cells across the border due to travel restrictions. Similarly, the ASTCT has endorsed the \u201cPractical Guidance for the BMT Centers\u201d suggested by the Adult BMT Service team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC, v1.0 March 25, 2020] (https://astct.org/viewdocument/guidance-for-bmt-centerfunctioning?CommunityKey=d3949d84-3440-45f4-814290ea05adb0e5&tab=librarydocuments). The MSKCC BMT guide also recommends cryopreservation of all related and unrelated donor products just like WMDA and EBMT. They also recommended considering peripheral stem cell collection over marrow collection, to prefer domestic donors/cord blood banks over international ones, and to have a backup donor preferably for allogeneic HSCT in case required. Therefore, the use of alternative donors such as haploidentical or cord blood transplants may increase somewhat due to urgent situations when a patient\u2019s primary diagnosis would not allow deferring transplant for later.",

However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the nationwide volunteer blood donations. Blood product shortage needs to be anticipated before and an effective communication with the other local blood banks as a source of blood products should be in place [2]. These blood shortages are probably the result of nonpharmacological interventions such as home sheltering, social distancing, home quarantine, etc. which are being promoted in order to suppress the community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 spread [3]. Unfortunately, this has led to an unprecedented cancellation of blood donation drives. This adds an additional responsibility on the transplant team to keep coordinating with the blood bank colleagues to ensure blood products are available 24 \u00d7 7. Pagano et al. in their report discussed the measures taken to defend blood shortage at the University of Washington, Seattle. Based on their observation, steps such as canceling the elective surgeries and procedures, requesting one unit of red blood cells at a time, rechecking on the indications of blood product order requests, and calling for more blood donation drives could help the blood centers and hospitals to tide over the COVID-19 crisis (https://fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-blood-donations) [4]. To spare the scarce resources (regular and ICU beds, personnel, blood products, etc.) that are expected to be in high demand during the COVID-19 surge, transplant centers have been postponing stem cell transplants whenever clinically possible [5].",
