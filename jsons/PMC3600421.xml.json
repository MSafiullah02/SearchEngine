In the following decade, microarrays were first successfully realized as DNA or oligonucleotide microarrays, which allowed the quantification of the mRNA expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel. This technology has changed many aspects of biological research. Though extremely successful, the chemistry of DNA hybridization precludes its application for studying proteins, which are considered the major driving force in cells. Consistent with this view, mRNA profiles do not always correlate with protein expression as reported in many recent mass spectrometry studies 1, 2, 3. Therefore, protein microarrays were developed as a high\u2010throughput tool to overcome the limitations of DNA microarrays, and to provide a versatile platform for protein functional analyses 4, 5, 6.",

However, these early attempts only had limited success, because (i) heterologous proteins (e.g. human proteins) were expressed in bacteria, yielding proteins that lacked critical eukaryotic PTMs; (ii) denaturing conditions were used to lyse the bacterial host, resulting in improperly folded proteins; (iii) proteins of interest were not purified away from thousands of unwanted bacterial proteins; and (iv) the density of the array was low. Before long, other research groups began to report their efforts to fabricate high\u2010density protein microarrays with purified proteins or antibodies 9, 10, 11, 12. In order to improve protein stability and preserve the native conformation of purified proteins, many research groups developed a variety of surface features to keep proteins hydrated during protein microarray fabrication. These efforts included reports on the 3D gel\u2010pad chips 13, nanowell chips 11, and plasma membrane\u2010coated chips 14, to name a few.",

These microarrays were then used to screen 400 Canadian serum samples collected during the 2002 SARS outbreak, including samples from confirmed SARS\u2010CoV cases, respiratory illness patients, and healthcare professionals. Antibody response was quantified by the application of both anti\u2010human IgG and IgM antibodies each coupled to different fluorophores, followed by measurement of fluorescence signal intensity (Fig. 2). To identify potential biomarkers, serum samples were first clustered according to the relative signal intensities of all of the coronavirus proteins in an unsupervised fashion (See Data Analysis section). The serum samples fell into two major groups, which upon subsequent comparison with clinical data were largely correlated with either SARS\u2010positive or SARS\u2010negative sera. In the cluster of markers, five fragments of the SARS N protein associated tightly with SARS infection, while SARS sera also exhibited statistically significant binding to one spike protein fragment. However, a few proteins encoded by other coronaviruses also showed significant correlation. To determine the best classifiers and classification model, two different supervised analysis approaches, k nearest neighbor and logistics regression were applied, and the N protein of SARS\u2010CoV, as well as the spike protein S from both SARS\u2010CoV and HCoV\u2010229E, were identified as the best classifiers. A useful feature of a serum test relative to a nucleic acid diagnostic test is that anti\u2010pathogen antibodies can potentially be detected long after infection. Taking advantage of this, serum samples collected from SARS patients, who recovered from respiratory disease (\u223c320 days after diagnosis), were used to probe the microarray and positive signals were detected with both anti\u2010human IgG and IgM antibodies (Fig. 2; middle panel). These results clearly showed that SARS\u2010CoV N proteins could be readily recognized by human IgG antibodies and importantly, not by IgM antibodies, as expected. However, serum samples collected from the Chinese patients immediately after fever was detected showed much stronger signals both in the IgG and IgM profiling (Fig. 2; left panel). These results indicated that the protein microarray approach is capable of detecting anti\u2010pathogen antibodies in serum samples long after infection, as well as detecting infection at early stages of infection as demonstrated by anti\u2010human IgM profiling. The approach developed here is potentially applicable to all viruses and expected to have a great impact on epidemiological studies and possibly in clinical diagnoses.",

EBV is an ubiquitous human herpesvirus, while KSHV has a restricted seroprevalence. Both viruses are associated with malignancies and show an increased frequency in individuals who are co\u2010infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101). The Zhu and Hayward groups generated a protein microarray consisting of 174 EBV and KSHV full\u2010length proteins that were individually expressed and purified from yeast 36, 41. Instead of sera, plasma antibody responses to EBV and KSHV were examined from healthy volunteers and patients with B\u2010cell lymphoma or with AIDS\u2010related Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma. These experiments detected IgG responses to known antigens, as well as the tegument proteins ORF38 (KSHV), BBRF (EBV), BGLF2 (EBV), and BNRF1 (EBV), and to the EBV early lytic proteins BRRF1 and BORF2. Because IgA responses to EBV EBNA1 and viral capsid antigens have long been used as a diagnostic tool for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, they also found IgA responses in healthy and HIV\u2010infected patients. IgA responses to VCA and to EBNA1 were found to be frequently elevated in lymphoma patients and in individuals who were HIV\u20101 positive. Comparison between the IgG and IgA responses indicated that IgA responses were much higher against BCRF1, BRRF2, and LMP2A. Therefore, this study demonstrated that plasma can be used for biomarker identification; immunoglobulin responses of other isotypes, such as IgA, are therefore also worth testing.",

            "text": "To demonstrate that protein microarrays could also be used to identify new biomarkers in autoimmune diseases, Chen et al. decided to apply an E. coli K12 proteome microarray 17 to profile serum samples collected from Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients 46. CD and UC are chronic, idiopathic, and clinically heterogeneous intestinal disorders collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although IBDs have been suggested to be autoimmune diseases, anti\u2010microbial antibodies are present in the sera of IBD patients, and some of these antigens have proven to be valuable serological biomarkers for diagnosis and/or prognosis of the disease. In this study, a protein microarray, including 4256 proteins encoded by a commensal K12 strain, was screened using individual serum from healthy controls (n = 39) and clinically well\u2010characterized patients with IBD (66 CD and 29 UC). Surprisingly, among the 417 E. coli proteins that were differentially recognized by serum antibodies from healthy controls and either CD or UC patients, 169 proteins were identified as highly immunogenic in healthy controls, 186 proteins were identified as highly immunogenic in CD patients, and only 19 proteins were identified as highly immunogenic in UC patients. Using several statistical tools, they identified two sets of serum antibodies as novel biomarkers for specifically distinguishing CD from healthy controls (accuracy, 86 \u00b1 4%; p < 0.01) and CD from UC (accuracy, 80 \u00b1 2%; p < 0.01). This study was the first demonstration of using high\u2010density, high\u2010content proteome microarrays to discover novel serological biomarkers.

            "text": "A protein microarray composed of individually purified human proteins would be an ideal tool for discovery of novel autoantigens associated with an autoimmune disease. Take autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as an example: AIH is a chronic necro\u2010inflammatory disease of human liver with little known etiology. Detection of nonorgan\u2010specific and liver\u2010related autoantibodies using immunoserological approaches has been widely used for diagnosis and prognosis. However, these traditional autoantigens, such as anti\u2010SMA (smooth muscle autoantibodies) and anti\u2010ANA (antinuclear autoantibodies) are often mixtures of complex biological materials. Unambiguous and accurate detection of the disease demands identification and characterization of these autoantigens. Therefore, Song et al. fabricated a human protein microarray of 5011 nonredundant proteins that were expressed and purified as GST fusions in yeast 45. There are several advantages associated with producing human proteins in yeast rather than bacteria: (i) higher solubility, (ii) higher yields of large proteins (e.g. > 50 kD), (iii) better preserved conformation of proteins, and (iv) proteins are less immunogenic when produced in yeast than in E. coli\n17, 21, 25. However, unlike a viral or bacterial protein microarray, a significant obstacle to the use of a human protein microarray of high content is its high cost. For example, a human protein array of 9000 proteins can exceed $1000 per array. In order to reduce this cost, Song et al. developed a two\u2010phase strategy to identify new biomarkers in AIH. Phase I is designed for rapid selection of candidate biomarkers, which are then validated in Phase II (Fig. 3). In Phase I, 30 AIH and 30 control serum samples were selected and individually used to probe the human protein microarrays at a 1000\u2010fold dilution, followed by detection of bound human autoantibodies using a Cy\u20105\u2010conjugated anti\u2010human IgG antibody. Statistical analysis revealed 11 candidate autoantigens. To validate these candidates and to avoid a potential overfitting problem (see below), which is especially likely when dealing with a small sample size, the 11 proteins and three positive controls were re\u2010purified to build a large number of low\u2010cost small arrays for Phase II validation. These arrays were then sequentially probed with serum samples used in Phase I and serum samples obtained from an additional 22 AIH, 50 primary biliary cirrhosis, 43 hepatitis B, 41 hepatitis C, 11 system lupus erythematosus, 11 primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and two rheumatoid arthritis patients. As negative controls, they also included 26 serum samples from patients suffering from other types of severe disease and 50 samples from healthy subjects. Three new antigens, RPS20, Alb2\u2010like, and dUTPase, were identified as highly AIH\u2010specific biomarkers with sensitivities of 47.5% (RPS20), 45.5% (Alba\u2010like), and 22.7% (dUTPase), which were further validated with additional AIH samples in a double\u2010blind design. Finally, they demonstrated that these new biomarkers could be readily applied to ELISA\u2010based assays for clinical diagnosis and prognosis.",

            "text": "This study represents a new paradigm in biomarker identification using protein microarrays for three reasons. First, a manageable number of candidate biomarkers can be rapidly identified at low cost because fewer expensive protein microarrays of high content are needed in the first phase of this two\u2010phase strategy. Second, by using small arrays comprised selected candidate proteins, the validation step can be rapidly carried out with a much larger cohort at lower cost. This validation step is extremely important for avoiding the overfitting problem associated with statistical analysis in biomarker or classifier identification, especially when dealing with a small cohort (e.g. <40). Overfitting is a problem in which a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. It generally occurs in biomarker identification when the system is excessively complex, such as having too many individual\u2010to\u2010individual variations relative to the number of samples used. As a result, biomarkers that have been overfit generally have poor predictive performance. Therefore, testing an additional, larger cohort in a double\u2010blind design is an effective way to rule out overfit biomarkers. Third, the author developed ELISA\u2010based assays to examine the performance of the validated biomarkers with additional samples. These newly identified biomarkers serve as a translational step toward clinical practice.",

These studies have clearly demonstrated the power of protein microarrays in identification of potential biomarkers; however, several shortcomings are repeatedly seen in these studies. For instance, many of these arrays were fabricated using proteins translated in E. coli lysates without purification 43, 44, 47, 54. Because these proteins are contaminated with unwanted E. coli proteins, sensitivity of the assay is likely reduced due to their high immunogenicity 41. As a result, E. coli lysates had to be used as a blocking reagent to alleviate this problem. Also problematic is that in many of these studies, identified biomarkers were not validated with additional cohorts and therefore, the possibility of overfitting was not completely ruled out.",

The human \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 herpesviruses infect different tissues and cause distinct diseases, ranging from mild cold sores to pneumonitis, birth defects, and cancers 55. However, they each confront many of the same challenges in infecting their hosts, including reprogramming cellular gene expression, sensing cell\u2010cycle phase, and modifying cell\u2010cycle progression, and reactivating the lytic life cycle to produce new virions and spread infection. On the other hand, many lytic cycle genes involved in replication of the viral genomes (e.g. the orthologous serine/threonine protein kinases) are highly conserved across the herpesvirus family. Therefore, it became an attractive hypothesis that the shared substrates targeted by these orthologous viral kinases would reveal host pathways that are critical for replication across the herpesvirus family.",

The authors purified four orthologous kinases encoded by EBV, KSHV, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and HSV\u20101, performed kinase reactions on a human protein microarray described previously 4, and identified 110 shared substrates. Like every large\u2010scale screen, the next challenge was to select candidates that would be worth pursuing. To do so, the authors then applied Gene Ontology and STRING analyses (http://string-db.org/, a database of known and predicted protein\u2013protein interactions) to these candidates and found a highly connected cluster of 15 proteins. Strikingly, these proteins were all known to be involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) (Fig. 4). The host DDR has been known to be important to many viruses, including human herpesviruses, and is relevant to virus\u2010induced tumorigenesis 35. To narrow down this list to a single candidate for in\u2010depth characterization, the authors reasoned that the viruses are likely to target an upstream master regulator, which triggers the DNA damage response. On the basis of a literature search and the structure of this cluster, Tat\u2010interactive protein 60 (TIP60) emerged as an excellent candidate for follow\u2010up, because (i) TIP60 is further upstream in the DDR pathway than any of the other candidates in the cluster; (ii) it serves as a master regulator in DDR via activation of ATM autophosphorylation activity by acetylation; (iii) it regulates chromatin dynamics via histone acetylation; and (iv) its importance has been shown in other viruses. Indeed, the authors observed that when TIP60 was knocked down in EBV\u2010infected B cells, EBV's lytic replication was greatly reduced. Next, the authors applied a series of cell\u2010based assays and showed that during EBV replication, TIP60 activation by the BGLF4 kinase triggers EBV\u2010induced DDR and also mediates induction of viral lytic gene expression. Finally, the authors demonstrated that TIP60 was also required for efficient lytic replication in HCMV, KSHV, and HSV\u20101.",

In a recent example, Hayward et al. surveyed the interactome between a KSHV\u2010encoded virulent factor, LANA, and the human host using human protein microarrays, in order to identify host proteins that can be recognized by LANA 57. LANA functions in latently infected cells as an essential participant in KSHV genome replication and as a driver of dysregulated cell growth. Although yeast two\u2010hybrid screens, GST affinity, immunoprecipitation assays, and chromatography coupled with MS have been applied to the identification of LANA binding proteins, each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and each tend to identify different sets of proteins. In this study, the authors used purified FLAG\u2010tagged LANA applied to human protein microarrays to identify 61 potential binding partners, many of which were previously unknown. Eight out of nine proteins were validated by co\u2010immunoprecipitation, including TIP60, protein phosphatase 2A, replication protein A (RPA) and XPA. Although human papillomavirus E6, HIV\u20101 TAT, and HCMV pUL27 interact with TIP60 and induce TIP60 degradation, LANA\u2010associated 42 retained acetyltransferase activity and showed increased stability. This observation is in line with the study described in the previous section that showed that TIP60 plays a positive role in KSHV lytic replication. On the other hand, identification of RPA as a LANA interacting partner suggested that LANA may play a role in regulating the length of host telomeres, because RPA1 and RPA2 are known to be essential in the replication of cellular telomeric DNA. To test this hypothesis, the authors performed ChIP assays with anti\u2010RPA1 and \u2010RPA2 antibodies using primers specific to the telomere regions and found that the presence of LANA drastically reduced the recruitment of both RPA1 and RPA2 to the host telomeres, while it had no impact on the protein level of the RPA complex. This observation raised the possibility that LANA might have an impact on telomere length. Using Southern blot analysis of terminal restriction fragments, the standard method for quantifying telomere length, the authors demonstrated that the average length of telomeres was shortened by at least 50% in both LANA\u2010expressing endothelial cells and KSHV\u2010infected primary effusion lymphoma cells. Many interesting questions remain to be answered. How does LANA block the RPA complex recruitment to the telomeres? Is it achieved via direct competition since LANA is also an ssDNA\u2010binding protein? Or, does LANA serve as a kinase sink for the RPA complex and regulate RPA recruitment via phosphorylation?",

Similar to the ubiquitylation pathway, SUMOylation involves a series of sequential enzymatic reactions that conjugate SUMO to lysine residues on substrate proteins. Previous studies have shown that both latent and lytic EBV proteins interact with the SUMO system. Noncovalent SUMO\u2010EBV protein interactions can occur via a SUMO interaction motif (SIM) in the target proteins. To comprehensively identify additional EBV proteins that bind to SUMO, Li et al. performed a protein\u2010binding assay with human SUMO2 58 on a previously described EBV proteome microarray 41 and identified a total of 11 proteins, including the conserved viral kinase BGLF4. The mutation of potential SIMs in BGLF4 at both N\u2010 and C\u2010termini changed the intracellular localization of BGLF4 from nuclear to cytoplasmic, while BGLF4 mutated in the N\u2010terminal SIM remained predominantly nuclear. The mutation of the C\u2010terminal SIM yielded an intermediate phenotype with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. The authors also found that BGLF4 abolished the SUMOylation of the EBV lytic cycle transactivator ZTA, and that this inhibitory effect on ZTA SUMOylation was dependent on both BGLF4 SUMO binding and BGLF4 kinase activity. The global profile of protein SUMOylation was also suppressed by BGLF4 but not by the SIM or kinase\u2010dead BGLF4 mutant. Furthermore, BGLF's interaction with SUMO was required to induce the cellular DNA damage response and to enhance the production of extracellular virus during EBV lytic replication.",

Binding experiments conducted using the streptococcal arrays and human protein probes identified 17 of the 20 known interactions previously reported as well as eight newly identified streptococcal proteins, many of which they confirmed by far Western blot analysis. These novel proteins included proteins of unknown function as well as three related proteins that they termed the fib proteins. They then used domain mapping to identify regions of the fib proteins required for their interaction with the human ligands. Interestingly, sera samples from patients with S. agalactiae infections show high titers of fib\u2010specific antibodies, indicating that these proteins are highly expressed during infection. Further work will determine the role of these proteins in infection and whether they will emerge as suitable drug targets to fight pathogenic Streptococcus infections.",

Rhabodymyosarcoma is a rare childhood cancer that arises from undifferentiated muscle progenitor cells. Although current treatments can yield as high as a 67% disease\u2010free survival rate, the reasons for treatment failure in the remaining one\u2010third of patients are unknown. The identification of biomarkers to allow distinguishing these patients from those that respond to traditional therapies would help identify those patients best suited for alternative therapies, and also potential drug targets. These reverse phase arrays were therefore used as platforms to detect the phosphorylation status of proteins thought to underlie whether rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes were responsive to standard chemotherapy regimens. Using phosphosite\u2010specific antibodies, the authors identified higher phosphorylation levels in four Akt/mTOR pathway components in patients with poor survival outcomes. Network analysis based on this data and known pathway information was used to find that, on the other hand, patients with good treatment outcomes showed mTOR pathway suppression. Together, these findings suggested that pharmacologically inducing mTOR pathway suppression could result in improved outcomes for patients that failed to respond to standard chemotherapy regimens. The authors proceeded to test this hypothesis using a mouse xenograft model with rhabdoymyosarcoma cell lines and a known mTOR pathway inhibitor. They found that treatment with the inhibitor resulted in reduced phosphorylation of the protein 4E\u2010BP1 that had been identified by the protein microarray studies, as well as inhibition of tumor growth. These results suggest that mTOR pathway inhibitors may be a potential way to improve treatment outcomes for patients that fail to respond to standard chemotherapy regimens. Additionally, they demonstrate the power of tumor cell lysate arrays in (i) identifying specific patient subpopulations that could benefit from tailored therapies, as well as (ii) identifying the specific molecules that should be targeted in developing and testing these therapies. However, there are several major problems with the reverse phase array approach. First, well\u2010characterized antibodies are not available for the great majority of human proteins 71, 72. Second, several recent studies have suggested that many commercially available monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may not even recognize their purported targets, and cross\u2010react extensively with other cellular antigens 73. Third, antibody cross\u2010reactivity is an even more pressing problem in diagnostic and therapeutic applications, as underlined by the recent withdrawal of several mAb\u2010based pharmaceuticals from the market 74, 75. Finally, this approach requires prior knowledge as to which phosphoproteins should be evaluated and as a result, is not an ideal platform for the discovery of novel biomarkers.",

The identification of biomarkers that would allow early detection of breast cancer could provide a noninvasive, low cost method that could improve patient outcomes. One promising category of cancer biomarkers is autoantibodies to tumor antigens that offer better stability, specificity, ease of purification, and ease of detection compared to other serum proteins. In order to identify autoantibodies to tumor antigens associated with breast cancer, Anderson et al. used protein arrays containing candidate tumor antigens and applied breast cancer patient and control serum samples to identify differences in the human antibody repertoire that could be used as biomarkers 50. These custom protein arrays, termed \u201cNAPPA\u201d arrays (Nucleic Acid Protein Programmable Array), are fabricated by the spotting of cDNAs that encode the target proteins at each feature of the array. Proteins are transcribed and translated by a cell\u2010free system and immobilized by encoded epitope tags, thus bypassing the protein purification process. Additionally, the authors used a three\u2010phase screening approach to home in on the best candidate breast cancer biomarkers. In the first phase, they used arrays with the full set of 4988 tumor antigens in order to eliminate uninformative autoantibodies that were present at similar levels in both early breast cancer patients and healthy women. Subtracting these antigens, the protein set was reduced to 761, allowing them to fabricate smaller arrays for the next phase that offer the benefits of reduced cost and fewer false positives. In the second phase, sera from patients with invasive early breast cancer and benign breast disease were compared, in order to identify antigens specific to early breast cancer but absent from benign breast disease, resulting in 119 antigens. In the third phase, they set out to validate this antigen list, finding 28 antigens that maintained high levels of specificity in a blinded validation assay, including the protein ATP6AP1, a known autoantigen. They then focused on this protein and went on to show high expression of ATP6AP1 in four breast cancer cell lines by Western blot, as well as significantly higher ATP6AP1 autoantibody levels in approximately 13% of early breast cancer serum cases compared to controls. Although only a first step, this work demonstrates the power of protein microarrays, in particular programmable protein microarrays, in identifying biomarkers for the early detection of breast cancer.",

The molecular players in these events, in turn, may be the best place to start in efforts to develop novel therapies. In order to identify autoantibody biomarkers that could act as indicators of bladder cancer, as well as the underlying molecular pathology contributing to disease, Orenes\u2010Pinero turned to a protein array strategy using the Invitrogen Protoarray containing approximately 8000 purified human proteins to identify antibodies to tumor\u2010associated antigens in serum 52. Comparing serum samples collected from 12 patients with bladder cancer and ten control patients without bladder cancer, they identified 171 differentially expressed proteins. Among these, they selected clusterin and dynamin for validation based in part on their known role in cancer biology. Using immunohistochemistry on a custom tissue microarray comprised bladder cancer tumor samples, they found reduced expression levels of clusterin in muscle invasive bladder tumors as compared to nonmuscle invasive tumors. On the other hand, they found that low\u2010protein expression of dynamin was associated with increased tumor stage and grade, higher recurrence rate after surgery, as well as shorter survival. Paradoxically, their follow\u2010up tests revealed lower expression levels of dynamin and clusterin associated with disease, in contrast to their protein array results that showed increased autoantibody levels to these proteins among bladder cancer patients compared to controls. Despite these contradictory findings, the authors demonstrated significant associations between dynamin and clusterin expression levels and bladder cancer disease progression that could potentially allow them to use these as informative biomarkers in the clinic as well as potential drug targets.

Although lectin microarrays in early reports were only composed of a small number of lectins, in a later report a high\u2010content lectin microarray composed of 94 unique commercial lectins was fabricated and used to profile accessible surface glycans of mammalian cells 51.

In order to overcome these problems, researchers have modified lectin microarray technology in many ways 88. One example is antibody\u2010assisted lectin profiling that was developed for detecting glycoproteins at low concentrations. Kuno et al. used this method to analyze the glycan structures of a protein hPod, which has been proposed to enhance the metastatic potential of glioblastoma cells 86. The hPod protein complex was first IP enriched with the appropriate antibody and then incubated on a lectin array to identify its associated glycans. An additional modification of the lectin microarray platform is the use of the evanescent\u2010field activated fluorescence detection system, which allows for label\u2010free, real\u2010time detection. Since the evanescent field is generated within 200 nm, the background signals are so low that washing steps are not necessary. It has been reported that this detection system has by far the highest sensitivity among the lectin microarray detection systems, with a reported detection limit in the 100 pM range 89. Finally, Li et al. reported a two\u2010phase discovery and validation approach to improve the sensitivity of the lectin microarray technology in cancer biomarker discovery for prostate cancer 90.

After incubating the IPed PSA or MME proteins on a lectin microarray, captured PSA or MME proteins were detected with anti\u2010PSA or anti\u2010MME mAbs. Comparison of signals between each group of pooled tissue revealed that the fraction of PSA that is O\u2010glycosylated (as recognized by jacalin) or Neu5Ac conjugated (as detected by SNA), as well as the fraction of MME that was modified by either GalNAc or GlcNac was highly elevated in aggressive prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer groups. These results were confirmed with immunosorbent assay in phase II, in which PSA and MME were first captured on an ECL plate coated with anti\u2010PSA and anti\u2010MME mAbs, followed by detection with biotinylated lectins.

Indeed, recent advances in immunoproteomics and high\u2010throughput technologies have suggested that the autoantibody repertoire in cancer patients might be quite different as compared with that in healthy subjects, leading to the hypothesis that autoantigens might be identified as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, as well as cancer prognosis 91. Ideally, a human protein microarray developed for such a purpose should cover the entire human proteome, in order to enable a comprehensive screen for the autoantigens. To our knowledge, we have fabricated a human proteome microarray of the best coverage (>70%) 21. However, when hundreds, if not thousands, of serum samples are needed to screen for biomarkers, the cost of using these human proteome microarrays accumulates very rapidly. An effective strategy to overcome this obstacle is to apply the two\u2010phase strategy as described in the AIH study 45. We expect that this strategy will become popular in the near future. Finally, we expect that functional protein microarrays will be used as a readout to obtain reaction profiles of the collected activities of various types of enzymes, such as kinases, acetyltransferases, ubiquitin, and SUMO E3 ligases in cancerous tissues.
