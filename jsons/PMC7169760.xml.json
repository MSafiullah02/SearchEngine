            "text": "Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea (PED) is a viral disease that causes acute diarrhoea, dehydration, and a high mortality rate in suckling piglets. The virus responsible for PED (PEDV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (Carstens, 2010). Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea was first described in Europe (UK) in 1971 (Wood, 1977) and subsequently spread to other European countries (Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978). In the 80's and 90's, PED epidemics became infrequent in Europe (Nagy, Nagy, Meder, & Mocsari, 1996; Pijpers, van Nieuwstadt, Terpstra, & Verheijden, 1993; Pritchard, Paton, Wibberley, & Ibata, 1999), while severe epidemics were reported in some Asian countries, such as Japan and Korea (Kweon et al., 1993; Takahashi, Okada, & Ohshima, 1983). In Thailand in 2007\u20132008 and in China in 2010\u20132012, severe PED outbreaks were reported (Li et al., 2012; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). Since May 2013, PED has become an epidemic in the USA (Stevenson et al., 2013), causing huge economic losses in swine production. Distinct viral strains have been identified in the USA. The highly virulent PEDV strain associated with severe outbreaks (Stevenson et al., 2013) is called \u201cUS original\u201d or \u201cnon\u2010S\u2010INDEL\u201d, in reference to the S\u2010INDEL, which shows minimal to no clinical signs (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014b) and is characterized by insertions and deletions in the spike (S) gene. Additionally, another coronavirus, genetically distinct from PEDV and similar to that detected in Hong Kong in 2011 (Woo et al., 2012), has been identified. This virus, called Porcine Delta Coronavirus (PDCoV), (Marthaler et al., 2014) has been found with a relatively high viral load, often in association with PEDV in farms experiencing acute diarrhoea in sows and piglets (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014a).",

            "text": "In Italy, PED has been present since the early 90s, and its spread has been increasing as infections caused by the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs (Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus, TGEV) decreases. After the severe epidemic of 2005\u20132006 (Martelli et al., 2008), sporadic outbreaks, characterized by mild symptoms and mortality rates slightly above the average, have occurred from 2007 to 2014 (Boniotti et al., 2016). A high level of genetic variability was observed among the strains circulating in Italy during that period (Boniotti et al., 2016). In particular, a novel coronavirus generated by recombination between PEDV and TGEV, called Swine Enteric Coronavirus (SeCoV), was identified. SeCoV was circulating in Italy from 2009 to 2012, was found in Germany (Akimkin et al., 2016) in 2012, and has recently been detected in Central Eastern Europe (Belsham et al., 2016). In July 2014, two new cases of PED, with mild clinical signs, were reported (Boniotti et al., 2016). Based on the S1 gene sequence, these new strains have a high identity with the American strain S\u2010INDEL OH851, which is defined as being less virulent. Since the end of 2014, PED has also been reported in Belgium (Theuns et al., 2015), Germany (Hanke et al., 2015), the Netherlands (Van Wolf et al., 2015), France (Grasland et al., 2015), Spain (EFSA, 2016), Slovenia (Toplak et al., 2016), Austria (Steinrigl et al., 2015), and Portugal (Mesquita et al., 2015), and strains genetically related to the American S\u2010INDEL strain have been identified in all of these countries. However, the virulent American prototype strain has only been identified in the Ukraine (Dastjerdi, Carr, Ellis, Steinbach, & Williamson, 2015).",

Pig transportation is often the main suspected source of PEDV infection, and thus, it can play a role in the transmission of PEDV to different herds (EFSA, 2016; Lowe et al., 2014). For the control and prevention of the disease, management, biosecurity and/or cleaning and disinfection measures should be adopted. Indeed, particular attention should be paid to the cleaning of transportation trucks, and the efficacy of decontamination procedures needs to be periodically monitored and verified.",

The mortality rate was calculated for the duration of the outbreak as the percentage of dead animals over the total animals of each category. Because the different age categories were not present at all 105 farms, percentages of diarrhoeic animals and mortality rates were recorded from 40, 39, 46, and 79 farms for breeders, suckling, weaned, and finishers, respectively. For breeders, data were recorded from the different areas within the herd in which they were present: insemination area, farrowing unit, gestation box, and gestation cage.

RT\u2010PCR was performed by adding 5 \u03bcl of extracted RNA to 20 \u03bcl of the OneStep RT\u2010PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) reaction mixture containing 0.4 \u03bcM of each primer (PEDV_S_1F: GGTAAGTTGCTAGTGCGTAA and PEDV_S_1R: TCCCATGTTATGCCGACAA). The amplification was carried out at 50\u00b0C for 30 min for the RT reaction, followed by the activation of the Hot\u2010start DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 15 min and by 45 cycles in three steps: 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 51\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. An additional extension for 10 min at 72\u00b0C was added at the end of the run. The PCR products were purified using NucleoSpin\u00ae Gel and PCR Clean\u2010up reagents (Macherey\u2010Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) and were subjected to nucleotide sequence analyses. Cycle sequencing reactions were performed using the BigDye\u00ae Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, version 1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were purified using a BigDye XTerminator\u2122 purification kit (Applied Biosystems) and sequenced on a 3500xL genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide sequences were assembled using the SeqMan module of the DNASTAR software package (Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA). Sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession nos.

The PEDV strain type was identified in 491 samples (434 stools, 15 rectal swabs, and 42 intestines/intestinal contents) out of 531 positive PEDV samples, which came from 403 of the 438 farms. Because of technical problems, such as low titre or degraded sample, the S1 gene could not be sequenced in 40 samples. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on 115 strains (excluding identical and/or partial nucleotide sequences) found in Italy and 32 sequences available in the NCBI database (Supporting Information Figure S1). The strains from Italy were divided into two clusters. In total, 360 of 491 (73.3%) showed a high degree of similarity (97.6%\u2013100%) with the European S\u2010INDEL strains circulating in 2014\u20132015 (Figure 2).

The proportions of PED cases caused by the recombinant PEDV/SeCoV variant that occurred in January, February, March, and April 2017 were 73.4%, 74,5%, 80%, and 93.75%, respectively, which made it the most widespread PEDV strain in Italy.",

After the 1990s, when PED disappeared from the other European countries, endemic waves, like the one that occurred in 2006 (Martelli et al., 2008), were followed by periods of sporadic outbreaks (2007\u20132014) (Boniotti et al., 2016). We cannot exclude that single cases could have occurred in Europe before the current US outbreak but were, most likely, neither investigated nor diagnosed as PED. In addition, seroprevalence, at both the animal and herd level, was high in farms from Northern Italy, even when only sporadic PED cases were detected (Alborali, Boniotti, & Lavazza, 2014). Unfortunately, very few serosurveys have been carried out in other European countries, but the limited data available showed an absent or very low seroprevalance (EFSA, 2016).",

In Italy, PEDV was first reported in July 2014 (Boniotti et al., 2016) and, since the beginning of 2015, a large number of PED outbreaks have occurred (531 out of 1,210 cases of enteritis), with peaks in the winter months. Outbreaks were observed in all of the farm production types but mainly in the fattening and farrow\u2010to\u2010wean farms. The typical clinical signs of PED were observed mainly in suckling and fattening animals, but patterns and severity levels differed. Watery diarrhoea with the presence of mucus and blood was observed in piglets, as well as in gestating and farrowing sows (Bertasio et al., 2016). In this study, 31% of herds with suckling pigs and 54% of herds with fattening pigs showed outbreaks in which more than 50% of the animals were diarrhoeic. The durations of disease's clinical signs were variable, ranging from a few days to up to 9 weeks (Bertasio et al., 2016). The mortality rates were higher in piglets, varying from 0% to 50%. These figures are similar to those reported in other European countries in the same period (Mesquita et al., 2015; Stadler et al., 2015; Steinrigl et al., 2015) and are in agreement with the EFSA Report of 2016, which indicated that the mortality was higher in the suckling piglet age group, with a mean of 18%, ranging from 0% to 84%.",

As a consequence of the swine vesicular disease outbreaks, which occurred in Italy in 2010, strict biosecurity measures, in particular the cleaning and disinfection of vehicles at slaughterhouse after animal unloading, were adopted. However, this study indicates that these measures are not effective enough to completely eliminate PED contamination from trucks. Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus can still be detected by RT\u2010PCR even after disinfection with several commercially available disinfectants (Bowman et al., 2015). In particular, during the winter months, when the virus titres in the faeces from infected animals are high (Ct < 25), these procedures reduced but did not completely eliminate the virus in 46% of the examined trucks that had tested positive prior to cleaning. The presence of the PEDV genome may not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious viral particles. However, Tun, Cai, & Khafipour (2016) demonstrated that PEDV has high rate of survival outside its swine host, being infective in manure for up to 9 months after the initial outbreaks on farms.",
