Typical examples include Legionella spp., non-tuberculous mycobacteria and a plethora of fungi and molds, including Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Aspergillus and Coccidiomycosis, just to name a few. While our immune systems have adapted in response to environmental threats, these pathogens will always remain a threat, particularly in subjects whose immune response becomes compromised by age or disease.",

During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, extensive public health campaigns aimed at reducing spread of respiratory droplets by good cough hygiene, the avoidance of work, school or day care during acute infections, and a massive uptake in mask wearing in the general populace had a dramatic effect on the rates of all viral respiratory infections in Hong Kong. 6 As relaxing these efforts led to a return to normal rates of viral transmission, much more can clearly be done to reduce community spread of pulmonary pathogens, especially during pan/epidemics.",

A very large number of age-related immune deficits have been described. Key changes increasing the risk of pulmonary infections include the production of lower affinity antibodies, reduced phagocytic ability and reduced responsiveness of na\u00efve CD4-positive T cells. 16 What is also important is that the pro-inflammatory response becomes progressively less regulated in the elderly, 17 often termed 'inflamm-ageing'. 18 The excess pro-inflammatory cytokine response is almost certainly a significant factor in the increased the risk of septic shock, ARDS and multi-organ failure in elderly patients with pulmonary sepsis. 19 Further complicating the fact that we have more vulnerable aged people in our communities is that we cluster them together. The close contact between elderly individuals in nursing homes and other agedcare residences frequently leads to rapid spread of new pathogens throughout the facility, as many case series have documented. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] While this close clustering is to some extent an economic necessity, much more study is required into how to limit the spread of respiratory pathogens in aged-care facilities, particularly in epidemic circumstances.",

Cardiac failure, chronic renal failure and diabetes in particular are all associated with a significantly greater risk of death from pneumonia. 26 Unfortunately, it also appears that immunization, at least against influenza, has substantially reduced efficacy in these vulnerable groups. [27] [28] [29] Adding to increasing age and increasing numbers of people with chronic organ failure in our communities is the additional factor of deliberate immunosuppression. In recent years the marked increase in tumour necrosis factor antagonists and monoclonal antibodies targeting specific lymphoid populations in patients with inflammatory arthritis (and especially rheumatoid disease) has significantly over taken patients on immunosuppressant therapy after solid organ transplantation as the major cause of iatrogenic immunosuppression. An increased risk of tuberculosis in particular has been a major problem with TNF antagonist therapy. 30 At the milder end of iatrogenic immunosuppression is recent evidence that inhaled corticosteroids, commonly used in asthma and COPD, probably increase the incidence of pneumonia. 31 However, whether this statistical increase in pneumonia is clinically important remains unclear as total mortality is not increased and total hospitalizations are lower, suggesting that the small increase in risk of pneumonia is more than compensated for by other beneficial effects.",

In some cases it is possible that the onset of disease is so swift that they are unable to seek help, especially if they live alone. However, many complex psychological and practical factors, including financial ability to access health-care, factor into the decision to delay medical treatment. 36 The lack of potential for new antibiotics to alter early mortality requires new approaches to be developed. Drotecogen alpha does appear to reduce some of the organ damage in patients with pneumonia and sepsis but the survival benefit is modest. 37 As discussed in the review on Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 reducing the virulence of invading pathogens is one promising line of research.",

            "text": "Human pulmonary pathogens are so well adapted to their human hosts that many cause little or no disease in animals. Some pathogens have also developed substantial adaptations to evade our immune responses to them. Structural change to the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis enabling it to resist digestion after phagocytosis is one well-characterized adaptation. An example of the extent to which human pathogens can adapt is the production by some viruses of an IL-10 like protein that can directly downregulate immune response. 44 As well as adapting to our innate immune response, pathogens also modify their genome in direct response to our attempts to reduce their virulence. The multitude of mechanisms by which bacteria have become antibiotic resistant is well documented, and due to these adaptations we now have problems with a wide range of pulmonary pathogens such as panresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa 45 and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. 46 Even in the community setting drug-resistant pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are beginning to become a significant concern as a cause of pneumonia in some regions. 47 Viruses can also adapt to anti-viral agents, for example neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza. 48 While not responding to any external pressure, the constant modification of viral genomes also ensures a steady supply of pathogens. Antigenic drift and antigenic shift continue to keep influenza near the top of the list of pulmonary pathogens. New pathogens, like the coronavirus responsible for SARS, 49 are also certain to continue to emerge, much as HIV did in the 1980s. Finally, if new threats do not arise naturally, there is always the unfortunate possibility that humans will deliberately introduce them. 50 Given the capacity for pathogens to adapt, it seems likely that regardless of what antimicrobials we develop, the development of resistance is inevitable. However, even if antibiotic resistance does not develop, clearing out one pathogen simply creates space for another to move in. Bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis are classic examples of a procession of bacteria occupying vacated niches. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria, which have increased significantly in the past few decades as problematic pulmonary pathogens, 51 are another example of bacteria finding new niches. The emerging data on serogroup replacement in pneumococci in response to pneumococcal vaccination 52 are further evidence that the efficacy of any strategy we develop to reduce bacterial infections is likely to reduce over time as bacteria adapt to the niche available.",
