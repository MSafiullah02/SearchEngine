Several recent reports have highlighted the impact of this RNA virus on immunocompromised hosts. In addition to its role in gastroenteritis in these patients, one astrovirus subgroup (VA1/HMO-C) has been reported to cause encephalitis in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and children with X-linked agammaglobulinemia [4, 5]. Molecular techniques including reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RNA sequencing, and next-generation sequencing have demonstrated the presence of this subgroup in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue of infected patients. Immunohistochemical staining on biopsy tissue has confirmed the presence of invasive infection. There are no known antiviral treatments available, and central nervous system (CNS) infection has been fatal in the cases reported to date. Additional study is needed to determine the prevalence of astrovirus infection in transplanted patients.",

Infection is most common in the late fall and winter, and most commonly presents with rhinorrhea, fever, cough, wheezing, or diarrhea. Thirty percent of children develop hypoxia, and a variety of radiographic findings have been reported, including peribronchial cuffing, lobar infiltrates, and pleural effusions. Nosocomial infection has occurred [8]. Bocavirus infection has been reported in the first few weeks following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, presenting with fever, rhinorrhea, cough, diarrhea, and hypoxia [9]. Virus has been detected in high quantities in plasma, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and stool. Fecal shedding occurs for several weeks to months after clinical resolution of infection [10]. Severe and prolonged diarrhea has been described in liver transplant and hematopoietic stem cell recipients [11]. It has been suggested that bocavirus, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza, may play a role in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans, a manifestation of chronic rejection in lung transplantation [12\u201314]. To date, there are no data on antiviral efficacy against bocavirus.",

Eighty percent of those affected were previously healthy, with no comorbid conditions. The outbreak began in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002 and with global travel spread rapidly to multiple continents. The infection of numerous health care workers and the rapidly fatal course of infection, even in healthy hosts, were remarkable.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV) has been reported to cause severe respiratory tract infection in adult patients, with a mortality rate as high as 60%, most commonly in those with diabetes mellitus and end stage renal disease [36]. After a median incubation period of 5 days (range, 2\u201314 days), patients often present with fever, cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea after close contact with an infected case and/or travel from an area where infection is active. Coryza, headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain have also been reported [37]. Laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated transaminases and LDH. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses has been reported [38]. As with SARS-CoV, health care workers are at risk for infection [39, 40]. Dromedary camels have been reported to harbor infection in the Arabian Peninsula, although the mode of transmission of infection has not yet been elucidated [41].",

Pancytopenia may be present. Radiographic infiltrates are most commonly interstitial, although 28% are alveolar. Pleural effusions may be present, and pneumothorax has been noted in a minority of patients. Diagnosis may be made by culture in human hepatoma HUH7 cell line, or by RT-PCR [46, 47].",

Epidemics of infection have been described from ingestion of contaminated water, mollusks, and undercooked deer, boar, or pig meat [53\u201355]. Blood transfusion-transmitted infection has also been described [56\u201359]. After an incubation period of two to nine weeks, patients develop jaundice, abdominal pain, anorexia, and nausea. Fever and chills may occur as well, although rash is unusual. Diagnosis can be made by RT-PCR detection of HEV RNA, which is present between 2 and 6 weeks after infection, as symptoms occur [60]. IgM antibodies develop as symptoms resolve, approximately 4 weeks after infection. Elevated transaminases occur, peaking approximately 6 weeks after infection. While viremia resolves within 6 weeks of infection, virus remains detectable in stool for several weeks after viremia resolves and IgG appears.

This flavivirus was first detected in the northeastern USA in 1999 and has caused outbreaks of infection in the late summer and early fall throughout the USA since then [184, 185]. Birds are the primary reservoir of infection. Mosquitoes acquire lifelong infection after biting viremic birds, spreading infection from their salivary glands to other species, including humans, with a subsequent bite. In human infection, the incubation period is 2\u201314 days [186]. While approximately 80% of infections are asymptomatic, 20% of patients develop West Nile fever, characterized by fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, myalgias, headache, and occasionally lymphadenopathy [187]. One in 150 symptomatic patients develops meningitis and/or encephalitis [188]. Meningitis presents with photophobia, phonophobia, meningismus, and hyperreflexia; CSF analysis reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis (<500 leukocytes/mm3, glucose usually normal). Patients with encephalitis develop altered mental status, cranial nerve palsies, seizures, and movement disorders. A minority of patients develop rapid asymmetric weakness that may progress to flaccid paralysis mimicking poliomyelitis, associated with hyporeflexia or areflexia [184, 189, 190]. Acute neuromuscular respiratory failure may develop, which carries a mortality rate of more than 50% [188]. Hemorrhagic fever characteristic of other flaviviruses has also been described [191]. The presence of severe weakness and hyporeflexia in a patient with meningoencephalitis should raise the suspicion of WNV infection. MRI may demonstrate meningeal or periventricular enhancement, sometimes mimicking ischemic changes [186].",

In immunocompromised hosts, central nervous system involvement is common, although CSF pleocytosis may be minimal [198\u2013200]. Community-acquired infection has been reported following solid organ transplantation, occurring 2 months to 10 years posttransplant [185, 199\u2013202]. A study of WNV infection during an outbreak in Toronto noted that liver, kidney, and heart transplant recipients had 40 times the risk of symptomatic infection as normal hosts [203]. In all cases, the recipients had participated in outdoor activities without the use of insect repellant or other personal protective measures. Fever often preceded neurologic symptoms. A delayed serologic response was noted in the transplanted cohort in which infection carried a mortality rate of 25%, versus 9% in the general population. In a Colorado outbreak in 2003, 11 transplant recipients (4 kidney, 2 liver, 2 kidney/pancreas, 1 lung, and 2 HSCT) developed infection requiring hospitalization [204]. Ten (91%) developed meningoencephalitis, one developed acute flaccid paralysis without encephalitis, and three patients had meningoencephalitis and paralysis. Two patients died (18% mortality), and three suffered significant neurologic sequelae. It appears that transplant recipients are more likely to develop meningoencephalitis in the setting of acute West Nile virus infection than immunocompetent hosts, perhaps with a higher mortality rate. Prolonged infection can also occur [205].",

Serology may be of limited value in immunocompromised hosts in the diagnosis of acute infection as well as in detecting reactivation of latent infections. Multiplex, quantitative real-time PCR assays are now available to detect multiple viruses, including panels of PCRs for detection of respiratory viruses and CNS pathogens [216, 217]. These sensitive techniques are being evaluated carefully in transplant populations for their specificity and for their potential utility as markers of early infection with surveillance monitoring. The impact of community-acquired respiratory viral infections on the development of acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans in lung transplantation appears to be significant and warrants further study [218, 219]. Continued vigilance in detecting emerging viral infections and continued study of potential antiviral therapies in the transplant population will likely improve patient survival.",
