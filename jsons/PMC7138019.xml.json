In high-income countries, there are generally slower declines in mortality during periods of economic growth and greater declines in mortality during recessions.13 In low-income countries, economic growth seems to improve health through improvements in basic services, until a country reaches $5000\u201310 000 GDP per person.12 Declines in mortality in high-income countries during recession could be related to decline in excess mortality from modifiable causes of death, such as those arising from alcohol abuse and motor vehicle accidents.12, 13 Given that Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of traffic-related deaths globally,4 the country might benefit from the austerity measures in this regard.

Anticipating potential effects of recession at an early stage of the crisis can inform health-sector reforms to diminish or avoid its harmful consequences on nation's health. Despite Saudi Arabia's unique challenges, the Ministry of Health has so far been successful in providing state-of-the-art medical services to its citizens. For example, Saudi Arabia's premarital sickle cell screening is a unique initiative.14 Despite free health care, Saudi Arabia's shortcomings are in the control of non-communicable diseases and mitigation of risk factors for disease.4 Only 23% of Saudi adults have had a preventive care visit.15, 16 There is a need to consider multipronged approaches to health promotion and avoidance of risk factors, including those that fall outside the services of health ministry (eg, enforcement of motor vehicle accident prevention advisories, point of sale restrictions on tobacco). By training primary care providers to serve as advocates for health promotion, each encounter between the provider and patient can be used as an opportunity to educate patients about a set of prevention messages. Informed personal decision making is important to increase the uptake of healthy lifestyles and prevention recommendations; this is a process achieved through education and a sense of personal empowerment that comes with employment. Outreach to civic organisations for partnerships in health promotion initiatives can help increase visibility and uptake.",

Agricultural approaches such as hydroponics, vertical farming, and landscaping with food-producing plants can increase food production, enable healthy eating habits, and improve air quality. Additionally, enrichment of food products (vitamin D, folic acid, iodine) is an easy and cheaper alternative to promotion of supplement use by individuals. The transition in the country's health-care delivery to the private sector and cost-sharing should be implemented without compromising services for the unemployed and uninsured. Similarly, efforts to nationalise the health labour force should consider continuity in essential service delivery.",

Health-care reform was long overdue in Saudi Arabia and the current crisis affords the country an opportunity to do it right. Saudi Arabia's future health security will rely on the choices made today by its health policy makers.",
