To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the impact of antifungal treatment on Candida spp. and P. aeruginosa interaction. Several studies have identified pathogenic interactions between microorganisms, such as herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus; influenza virus and P. aeruginosa; and C. albicans and P. aeruginosa [5, 9, 10]. Theses interactions have major environmental and medical consequences. A pathogenic interaction between C. albicans and P. aeruginosa has been demonstrated in experimental studies. Recent P. aeruginosa infection has been identified as a risk factor for fatal candidiasis in burned mice [11]. Molecular studies identified phylogenetic similarities between the two pathogens [5, 6]. The morphology and virulence of C. albicans are significantly affected by the presence of P. aeruginosa  [5]. A cell\u2013cell signaling molecule capable of inhibiting C. albicans filamentation is produced by P. aeruginosa  [5]. P. aeruginosa forms a dense biofilm on C. albicans filaments and kills the fungus. In contrast, P. aeruginosa neither binds nor kills yeast-form C. albicans. Several P. aeruginosa virulence factors that are important in disease are involved in killing of C. albicans filaments [5]. Azoulay et al. [8] recently reported the results of the first clinical study suggesting an interaction between C. albicans and P. aeruginosa. The authors identified Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization as an independent risk factor for P. aeruginosa pneumonia. No cause-and-effect relationship was demonstrated in that study. In addition, Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization and P. aeruginosa pneumonia could both be a consequence of prior antibiotic treatment. However, the lack of association with Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, another consequence of antibiotic treatment, indicates that an association between Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization and P. aeruginosa remains plausible. A more recent experimental study has evaluated the impact of C. albicans tracheobronchial colonization on the occurrence of P. aeruginosa pneumonia [12]. Rate of P. aeruginosa pneumonia was significantly higher in rats with C. albicans tracheobronchial colonization as compared with rats without C. albicans tracheobronchial colonization (33% vs 4%, p < 0.05).",

Bacterial biofilm may play an important role as a persistent source of infectious material for recurrent episodes of VAP [13]. Candida spp. and P. aeruginosa are the most common pathogens retrieved from endotracheal tube biofilm and tracheal secretions in patients with VAP [14]. Although all Candida spp. were taken into account in our study, previous experimental studies [5, 6, 12] were performed exclusively on C. albicans. However, in the study by Azoulay et al. [8] tracheobronchial colonization with any Candida spp. was identified as a risk factor for P. aeruginosa VAP. Further studies are needed to determine whether Candida spp. and P. aeruginosa interaction could be influenced by the nature of Candida spp.",

Second, some of the trends observed in this study could have reached statistical significance if more patients had been included. In addition, the number of patients needed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of antifungal treatment was not calculated a priori. Third, our study was conducted in a single ICU. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to other ICUs. Fourth, no information was available on the nature of prior antibiotic treatment or and on the quantity of Candida spp. in respiratory specimens. In addition, invasive methods were not used to diagnose VAP. However, quantitative tracheal aspirate culture was used in all patients with a high threshold (\u2265 106 cfu/ml). Postmortem studies showed acceptable overall diagnostic accuracy of quantitative tracheal aspirate compared with bronchoalveolar lavage or protected specimen brush [15]. Finally, antifungal treatment was based on medical staff decisions. Among the 36 patients who received antifungals, 19 patients received preemptive antifungal treatment. This finding is consistent with the results of a recent survey conducted in French ICUs [16]. However, recovery of Candida spp. from the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients without risk factors for immunosuppression is common and frequently reflects a tracheobronchial colonization [17, 18]. Some authors suggest that antifungal treatment should be based on the colonization index in these patients [19, 20].",
