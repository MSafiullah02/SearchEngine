            "text": "Influenza illness is generally characterized by acute onset of fever, mylagias, and respiratory symptoms, and while disease usually resolves without complications in healthy indiviudals, influenza is associated with an annual increase in hospital admissions for pulmonary, cardiovascular and neuromuscular compliations [1\u20133]. The etiology of influenza-associated pneumonia may include primary influenza pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, or concomitant viral and bacterial pneumonia [1, 4, 5]. Pulmonary complications of influenza, including pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease, are common and result in significant morbidity and mortality. Oliveira and colleagues found that among all patients admitted to a large metropolitan hospital with influenza during the 1999\u20132000 season, 49 % had pneumonia [6]. Further, in a study conducted over 4 influenza seasons (1999\u20132003), Murata and colleagues found that among 193 patients hospitalized with influenza A, 52 % had some type of acute findings on chest radiograph and 17 % had definitive pneumonic infiltrates [7]. Although there is evidence that adult patients with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease are more likely to develop influenza-associated pneumonia than those without underlying medical conditions [6, 7], much of the data describing factors associated with influenza-associated pneumonia among adults comes from case series conducted at single sites and during a limited number of seasons. Using data from a large multi-center, geographically diverse, population-based surveillance system, we describe factors associated with pneumonia among adults hospitalized with influenza over three consecutive years in which seasonal influenza viruses circulated.",

Starting with the 2007-2008 season, research questions were added to evaluate factors associated with severe outcomes during hospitalizations, and IRB review was conducted at all surveillance sites and the CDC. The protocol was approved by the CDC IRB and was either approved or received exempt status by all surveillance site IRBs.

The median age of patients with pneumonia compared with patients without pneumonia was 74 years versus 69 years (p <0.01) (Table 1). The majority of patients hospitalized with and without influenza-associated pneumonia were white. White patients were older (median age 74 years) than black patients (53 years), Hispanic patients (56 years), and patients of other races including Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Alaskan Native, and multi-race (69 years) (p <0.01).

Among those hospitalized with influenza, older adults and nursing home residents were at significantly increased risk for having influenza-associated pneumonia. Respiratory viruses including influenza are a common etiology of pneumonia in older adults, and several factors may contribute to the development of severe lower respiratory tract disease in these individuals, including decreased respiratory muscle strength and lung compliance, and waning humoral and cell-mediated immunity [10\u201312]. Additional risk factors for lower respiratory tract disease among older nursing home residents include immobility and swallowing difficulties leading to aspiration [13]. Within closed settings such as nursing homes, large outbreaks of influenza and its subsequent complications, including severe pneumonia, may rapidly evolve and lead to significant morbidity and mortality [10, 14]. Influenza virus infection should thus be considered a potential cause of pneumonia in older individuals and nursing home residents during fall and winter months when influenza viruses are circulating [2] and should be diagnosed and treated promptly. Influenza vaccination is the most effective method to prevent influenza and its complications, and older adults, residents of nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities, and adults with underlying medical conditions should be considered high priority groups for receipt of annual influenza vaccination [15].",

An unexpected finding was that patients with asthma in our analysis were less likely to have a diagnosis of pneumonia than patients without pneumonia. Our study results contrast with EIP surveillance data in hospitalized children <18 years of age which has shown that children with influenza-associated pneumonia were more likely to have asthma than those without pneumonia [16]. Studies of the association between asthma and seasonal influenza-associated pneumonia among adults are lacking. A possible explanation for our finding is that respiratory distress caused by influenza-associated asthma exacerbation provided an alternate reason for hospitalization in adult patients in the absence of pneumonia. Biases in hospital admission practices based on the presence of underlying conditions may have also contributed to admission of asthmatic patients with a less severe respiratory presentation compared to patients without underlying medical conditions.",

In our study, S. pneumoniae was the only organism to be cultured from a sterile site more frequently in patients with pneumonia that in patients without pneumonia.

While all hospitalized patients who tested positive for influenza were included in surveillance, data is unavailable for hospitalized patients who tested negative for influenza or who were not tested. Thus, these data may not be representative of all individuals hospitalized with influenza who may not have been tested or have laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection. It is possible that patients included in surveillance were more likely to be tested for influenza because they were more severely ill; thus a higher proportion of patients exhibiting pneumonia-like symptoms may have been tested for influenza than patients presenting with other symptoms. Furthermore, in our analysis, patients with pneumonia were compared to patients without pneumonia but with a wide array of other diagnoses. Clinican influenza testing practices based on patient diagnoses at presentation may have biased our findings. In one study conducted in an emergency department in Australia, patients presenting with fever and respiratory diagnoses were more likely to be tested for influenza than patients presenting with cardiac or other diagnoses [33]. This study assessed pneumonia specifically among adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza, including those whose influenza virus infection preceded hospitalization by more than a few days, and findings are not generalizable to all hospitalized individuals with pneumonia of other etiologies or to non-hospitalized individuals.",

For example, the finding of an inverse association between asthma and pneumonia may have been due to more aggressive admission of asthmatic patients presenting with respiratory distress despite the absence of pneumonia, compared with patients without asthma. Biases related to hospital admission practices were likely reduced by including patients from multiple hospital sites in geographically diverse settings. For certain underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease and cardiovascular disease, disease type and severity were not captured by the case report form. Availability of detailed data on type and severity of underlying conditions may have helped to better identify factors more strongly associated with development of influenza-associated pneumonia.",

As a result, some individuals may have been misclassified as having pneumonia based upon a report of infiltrates or opacities, when in fact they had a more chronic pulmonary condition or a transient episode of pulmonary edema or effusion. There was no requirement regarding timing of identification of radiologic abnormalities during the hospitalization, and the timing of chest radiographs during the hospitalization was not collected as part of EIP surveillance; thus, some misclassification of community-acquired pneumonia versus nosocomial pneumonia may have occurred. Using ICD-9-CM code data may also have led to misclassification if a diagnosis code was listed incorrectly or not listed at all. A joint case definition for pneumonia which used both radiographic data and discharge diagnosis data from ICD-9-CM codes or discharge summaries was utilized to minimize some of these biases. Bacterial culture data was only available for patients with a positive culture result rather than for all specimens spent, thus limiting the interpretation of the culture data.",
