A subsequent computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a 1 cm right sided calculus at the ureter-pelvic junction for which a nephrostomy tube was placed followed by percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The patient initially received 2 days of piperacillin/tazobactam, however, once the urine culture resulted in P. aeruginosa with no significant associated resistance, the patient was discharged home on a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily (BID) per os (P.O.). Both sets of blood cultures obtained on arrival to the emergency department at the OSH were negative for growth. Although the patient 3 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f did have an indwelling urinary bladder catheter placed during hospitalization, it was removed prior to discharge and he was told to resume self-catheterization at home. Two months later, the patient presented back to the OSH with fever. CT abdomen/pelvis revealed passage of the right sided calculus, however, this time, urine and blood cultures were positive for P. aeruginosa with no significant associated resistance. He was started on cefepime and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) obtained on admission was negative for any valvular abnormalities, including vegetation. However, despite treatment with cefepime, the patient's blood cultures continued to be positive for P. aeruginosa that had no significant associated resistance. One week into hospitalization, a CT chest with contrast was obtained and revealed a paratracheal mass, possibly suggestive of lymphadenopathy. On day 10 at the OSH, a TEE revealed a large vegetation involving the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve with severe aortic insufficiency; it was noted that an abscess was unable to be ruled out. Based on the persistent bacteremia and TEE findings, a diagnosis of infective endocarditis was reached.",

Additionally, due to a higher MIC for cefepime that resulted on day 10 for cultures that were obtained on day 7, (MIC of 8 compared to that of 2 from blood cultures obtained on arrival) the cefepime was switched to an extended infusion rate, 2g every 8 hours administered over 3 hours, instead of over 3-5 minutes. This change is based on the pharmacodynamics principle that beta lactam antibiotics have a time dependent effect on 7 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f bacterial eradication [11, 12] . Therefore, increasing the duration of exposure of the antibiotic to the bacteria by extending the infusion rate may be more effective at bacteria eradication especially at higher MICs [11, 12] .",

In the case of our patient surgery was delayed at the time due to a guarded clinical and functional status as well as the presence of hemorrhagic foci in the parietal lobes as evident on imaging. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished the patient's ability to adhere to follow up measures or consult with CTS. In the meantime, the patient has been advised to continue with the regimen of ciprofloxacin 750 mg BID P.O. and extended infusion cefepime. We have good reason to remain hopeful that updated blood cultures will be negative when the patient is in fact able to follow up.",

Due to worsening renal function, tobramycin was discontinued on day 8 at our facility and the patient was started on ciprofloxacin 750 mg BID P.O. along with continued cefepime. On day 10, a susceptibility profile for cultures obtained on day 7 resulted in P. aeruginosa with no significant associated resistance again, however with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8 for cefepime compared to an MIC of 2 on the blood cultures obtained on arrival. The cefepime was then changed from 2 g every 8 hours administered over 3-5 minutes to an extended infusion administered over 3 hours. Additionally, a TEE done at our facility on day 10 revealed the presence of an enlarged vegetation, 1.26 x 0.51 cm compared to the prior TEE done at the OSH 10 days prior which measured 1.11 x 0.30 cm.",
