            "text": "Foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease (FMD) is considered the most contagious infectious disease of cloven\u2010hoofed animals. Factors including excretion of large quantities of virus during infection, low infectious dose, multiple routes of transmission and ability to spread via aerosols for a long distance contribute to the highly contagious nature of this disease (Alexandersen et al., 2003). FMD causes severe economic damages due to production losses (decrease milk production, poor growth rate and calf mortality) in endemic countries and trade restrictions in FMD\u2010free countries. FMD is caused by foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV), a non\u2010enveloped, single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. FMDV occurs as seven distinct serotypes: A, O, C and Asia 1 and South African Territories (SAT) serotypes SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3. There is little or no cross\u2010protection between serotypes and even between different strains of the same serotype (Brooksby, 1982; Paton et al., 2005, OIE Terrestrial Manual, 2012).",

            "text": "FMD is characterized by vesicular lesions and ulcerations on the tongue, mouth, nasal region and coronary bands of infected animals (Alexandersen and Mowat, 2005). The clinical signs of FMD are not pathognomonic. A number of viral diseases including vesicular stomatitis (VS), swine vesicular disease (SVD), idiopathic vesicular disease (IVD), vesicular exanthema of swine (VES), mucosal disease (MD) and papular stomatitis clinically mimic FMD. In addition, bacteria, chemicals and mechanical trauma also cause erosions and ulcerations in mouth and feet of pigs and ruminants. Therefore, laboratory confirmation is essential for identification of FMDV\u2010infected animals. Current laboratory assays for FMDV detection include virus isolation, antigen ELISA and molecular assays [conventional and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (RRT\u2010PCR)]. Virus isolation takes several days, is labour\u2010intensive and can only be performed in specialized biocontainment facilities. Antigen ELISAs show limited sensitivity compared with molecular assays and also require skilled technicians to perform and interpret the assays. Conventional RT\u2010PCR and RRT\u2010PCR assays are highly sensitive and specific; however, sophisticated instrumentation, post\u2010amplification sample/data analyses and skilled technicians are required (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Oem et al., 2005; Moniwa et al., 2007; Goris et al., 2009; Longjam et al., 2011; McKillen et al., 2011; Madi et al., 2012).",

            "text": "FMD outbreaks have to be quickly detected and contained, and therefore, onsite detection tools are highly desirable. To date, a number of field\u2010deployable molecular assays have been developed and evaluated for their potential to use in the field to support local decision\u2010making (Dukes et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2011a,b; Madi et al., 2012; Abd El Wahed et al., 2013; Yamazaki et al., 2013; Kasanga et al., 2014; Ranjan et al., 2014; Waters et al., 2014; Howson et al., 2017), and some of them have been successfully tested in the field (Madi et al., 2012; Abd El Wahed et al., 2013; Howson et al., 2017). To our knowledge, none of those assays are commercially available yet. Here we report laboratory validation of a commercially available TaqMan probe\u2010based, field\u2010deployable reverse transcription\u2010insulated isothermal PCR (RT\u2010iiPCR) assay for rapid detection of all FMDV serotypes. The assay was performed on a commercially available compact POCKIT\u2122 Nucleic Acid Analyser (GeneReach USA, Lexington, MA, USA). The assay, POCKIT\u2122 FMDV Reagent Set (GeneReach USA), is available as lyophilized single\u2010tube reactions that can be performed on a field\u2010deployable instrument, POCKIT\u2122 Nucleic Acid Analyser (GeneReach USA). The POCKIT\u2122 analyser is a relatively inexpensive (~US$ 5000.00) compared with currently available thermocyclers. It is a compact (28 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 8.5 cm), lightweight (~2.1 kg) and user\u2010friendly instrument specially designed to perform PCR and RT\u2010PCR assays based on Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection (Chang et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2012; Balasuriya, 2014; Ambagala et al., 2017; Chua et al., 2016; Go et al., 2016). It measures the fluorescence intensity of each sample once prior to and once after the PCR or RT\u2010PCR amplification is complete, automatically calculates the ratio between initial and final fluorescence intensities or signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (R1) and therefore requires no data interpretation. If the R1 value is above the manufacturer's default threshold (1.3), a \u2018+\u2019 result is displayed, and if it is below 1.2, a \u2018\u2212\u2019 result is displayed on the LED screen built into the machine. Rarely, a \u2018?\u2019 result is displayed if the R1 value is equal to or between 1.2 and 1.3 (1.2 \u2264 R1 \u2264 1.3), indicating an unreliable result and this requires retesting the sample. The POCKIT\u2122 analyser processes up to 8 samples at a time with running time of around 60 min from sample addition to results.",

The iiPCR and LAMP assays typically provide comparable or better detection compared with conventional PCR and RRT\u2010PCR assays. The instrumentations needed for those assays are relatively inexpensive, less complicated, less delicate and easily decontaminated or disposed of between each use. Recently, a number of RT\u2010LAMP assays have been developed and validated for detection and typing of FMDV (Dukes et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2011a,b; Yamazaki et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2014; Kasanga et al., 2014; Ranjan et al., 2014; Waters et al., 2014; Farooq et al., 2015; Howson et al., 2017). The assays were rapid, highly sensitive and specific, and more resistant to inhibitors than conventional and RRT\u2010PCR assays. A novel real\u2010time reverse transcription RPA (RRT\u2010RPA) assay has been developed for detection of FMDV in the field, and its performance was evaluated during an FMD outbreak (Abd El Wahed et al., 2013). The assay generated results faster than the LAMP assay; however, it showed ~100 times lower sensitivity (1436 FMDV genome copies) compared with that of the RRT\u2010PCR assays. The RRT\u2010RPA assays need relatively long primers (30 nucleotides) and probes (at least 50 nucleotides), and therefore, designing RPA assays is challenging especially for viruses with highly variable genomes such as FMDV.",

The assay was able to detect as low as 9 copies of IVT RNA with 95% confidence. When a dilution series of FMDV genomic RNA belonging to all seven serotypes (extracted using MagMAX\u2122 system) were tested in both FMDV RT\u2010iiPCR and RRT\u2010PCR assays, it was evident that the FMDV RT\u2010iiPCR assay was equally or slightly more sensitive (with some strains) than the FMDV RRT\u2010PCR assay. The variability between serotypes may be attributed to the nucleotide sequence differences and/or the presence of secondary structures in or around the 3D genomic region in different FMDV strains. Based on our experience on iiPCR development, iiPCR assays are able to tolerate more base pair mismatches than conventional PCR (Ambagala et al., 2017). One hypothesis is that primer annealing in an iiPCR can occur within a temperature gradient which may allow the primers to hybridize with sequences with multiple mismatches and still initiate chain elongation. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the RT\u2010iiPCR assay were demonstrated using multiple samples types (nasal, oral and lesion swabs, oral fluids, vesicular fluid and epithelial tissues) collected from FMDV\u2010infected cattle, sheep and pigs. The RT\u2010iiPCR was able to detect FMDV RNA in all RRT\u2010PCR\u2010positive clinical samples, and additionally in some (~14%) of the RRT\u2010PCR\u2010negative samples. The higher sensitivity was clearly demonstrated with the preclinical samples collected from sheep experimentally infected with FMDV O/UKG/11/2001, which were positively identified by the FMDV RT\u2010iiPCR assay from 1 dpi but not until 3 dpi by the FMDV RRT\u2010PCR assay.

Pen\u2010based oral fluid provides a non\u2010invasive sample type that is easy to collect, resulting in a lower overall cost compared with individual animal sampling. Pen\u2010based oral fluids provide higher herd\u2010level sensitivity and herd\u2010level specificity for detection of pathogens compared with individual pig samples. Currently, the pen\u2010based oral fluid samples are shipped to central veterinary diagnostic laboratories for testing. In this study, we demonstrated that the pen\u2010based oral fluid can be used for rapid onsite detection of FMDV\u2010infected animals using RT\u2010iiPCR. The FMDV RT\u2010iiPCR assay readily detected FMDV RNA in oral fluid samples from all pens as early as 1 dpi.",

            "text": "One of the major bottlenecks of performing molecular assays in the field is the lack of a convenient, effective and safe procedure for nucleic acid isolation. Previously we have shown that diluted serum samples from CSFV\u2010infected pigs can be used directly, without nucleic acid extraction, for detection of CSFV RNA by a CFSV RT\u2010iiPCR assay (Lung et al., 2016). In this study, we demonstrated that the RT\u2010iiPCR assay can detect FMDV RNA in intact vesicular fluid samples without RNA extraction process. The R1 values for all positive samples were 4.9 or 5, except for the 1 : 5 diluted vesicular fluid sample from pig # 81. The R1 value reduction observed (2.7) on this sample could be due to inhibitory effects of proteins in vesicular fluid on the RT\u2010iiPCR assay. Similar observations were noted when undiluted serum samples were tested in the CSFV RT\u2010iiPCR assay (Lung et al., 2016). For more complex samples, however, nucleic acid extraction is required to ascertain high sensitivity. Most of the nucleic acid extraction methods available to date are too elaborate, labour\u2010intensive and require trained technicians to perform the procedure. Simplified column\u2010based extraction systems are available and they can be used to isolate total nucleic acids from clinical samples in the field (Ambagala et al., 2017), but still require a considerable amount of manual handling of the samples which can lead to potential contaminations and/or degradation of viral RNA. The field\u2010deployable fully automated taco\u2122 mini extraction system we demonstrated here can be used successfully to extract nucleic acid from more complex samples such as tissue suspensions and swab samples in the field. The taco\u2122 mini is a relatively inexpensive, light weight (5 kg), small footprint (30(H) \u00d7 26.5(D) \u00d7 26(W) cm) magnetic bead\u2010based extraction system that can extract total nucleic acids from 8 samples within 45 min.",

The total assay time (sample to results) for vesicular fluid samples is less than 1 h and for other samples types, when taco\u2122 mini extraction system is used, is less than 2 h. The FMDV RT\u2010iiPCR assay reagents are commercially available as a single\u2010tube, lyophilized and ready\u2010to\u2010use commercial kit. Both the POCKIT\u2122 instrument and the taco\u2122 mini extraction system can be operated using a car battery in the field. The assay can be deployed to veterinary offices, slaughter houses or borders in an outbreak to support onsite diagnosis by the veterinarians. FMDV RT\u2010iiPCR assay can be performed by anyone with basic laboratory skills (veterinary technicians, veterinarians, inspectors, etc.) after a few hours (2\u20133 h) of training. This onsite detection tool will allow the veterinarians to confirm clinical diagnosis quickly and take necessary actions to contain the spread of this highly contagious virus before the laboratory confirmations are available. Each taco\u2122 mini/POCKIT detection system can process only 6 samples plus a negative control and a positive control in a single run, and similar to other pen\u2010side detection tools available, are unlikely to replace the testing done at the centralized laboratories. Considering the commercial availability, rapid turnaround time, ease of use and portability, the FMDV RT\u2010iiPCR assay evaluated here warrants a comprehensive field validation.",
