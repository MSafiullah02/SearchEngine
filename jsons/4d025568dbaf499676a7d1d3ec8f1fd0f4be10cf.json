On further investigation, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen, which later on provisionally named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Coronaviruses are predominantly found in warmblooded animals and birds and cause various respiratory complications and multiorgan failure in the immunocompromised individuals. Human coronaviruses were first identified in 1965 and are responsible for the respiratory tract infections in major proportion of population worldwide; at least five new human coronaviruses have been identified, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The background related to the origin and classification of coronaviruses is reviewed here.",

A human coronavirus named SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) was associated with the SARS outbreak in the year 2002 (Zhong et al. 2003 Drosten et al. 2003b; Fouchier et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003) . Similarly 10 year after SARS outbreak, another deadly human coronavirus [Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)] emerged in the Middle East nations (Zaki et al. 2012) . Recently, a new coronavirus named 2019-nCoV (belonging to the family Coronaviridae and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) has erupted in the region of Wuhan (China) with severe respiratory tract infections in human. This virus is distinct from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV; animal-to-human transmission has been considered as the origin of this outbreak, as most of the patients had a history to visit a local fish and wild animal market in Wuhan during the epidemic (Chan et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020) . Animal-to-human and inter-human transmissions of this viral infection through respiratory route were established by certain group of scientists (Lu et al. 2020; Ji et al. 2020) . Patient isolation and accurate timely diagnosis are the hallmarks to control this new epidemic. It is also important to acquire knowledge from the history and evolution of coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis and its relation with different natural hosts of these viruses can help one to estimate its genetic variability which in turn has important applications for the viral etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and vaccine development.",

The era of human coronaviruses began in the year 1965 when Tyrrell and Bynoe observed that they could serially sub-passage a virus in tissue culture while doing research on human participants at the Common Cold Unit close to Salisbury, UK; they named this virus as B814 (Tyrrell and Bynoe 1966) . Their experiment demonstrated that common colds could be transmitted by nasal secretion that did not contain rhinoviruses, and further in vitro experiments of nasal swabs from these participants had been inoculated onto organ cultures obtained from respiratory tract cell lines. They discovered the presence of enveloped RNA viruses with the feature morphology of coronaviruses similar to the previously defined infectious bronchitis virus. They were unable to grow the virus in tissue culture at that time. Subsequently in the year 1966, Hamre and Procknow succeeded in growing a new virus (229E) of unexpected tissue culture properties from a medical graduate with symptoms of common cold (Hamre and Procknow 1966) .",

(1967a) had used the similar technique of Tyrrell and Bynoe to extract the multiple strains of ether-susceptible agents from human volunteers. These viruses were designated OC as they were grown in the organ culture of respiratory tract. In the year 1967, Almeida and Tyrrell were able to demonstrate the similar morphology of B814 and IBV under the electron microscopy of the fluid obtained from the inoculated organ culture. The virus particles were of size around 80-150 nm, pleomorphic, enveloped with membrane coating, and multiple clubshaped surface projections (Almeida and Tyrrell 1967) . All of these (229E, OC, B814, and IBV) along with the virus causing mouse hepatitis and transmissible gastroenteritis infection of swine had a similar morphology under electron microscopy (McIntosh et al. 1967b; Witte et al. 1968 ) ( Fig. 12.1 ). The new group of these viruses was named coronavirus in 1968 (corona means the crown-like structure with surface projection), reflecting their morphology in the electron microscope, and further Coronaviridae was accepted as their family name in 1975 (Tyrrell et al. 1975) .",

            "text": "In late December 2019, few patients with the history of unexplained fever and symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections were detected in Wuhan, an area avowed as the largest metropolitan city located in the Hubei province of China. The etiology of this unknown respiratory infection was not being able to be established; it was classified as pneumonia of unknown etiology initially. Further investigation by the local authority of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the causative pathogen and provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new coronavirus is COVID-19 which is the acronym of \"coronavirus disease 2019.\" The WHO raised the threat to this CoV epidemic in the category of \"very high\" level in February 2020. Various organizations throughout the globe are working to establish countermeasures to prevent possible devastating effects from this new human coronavirus.",

Toroviruses and coronaviruses are the two representative genera of the family Coronaviridae; they have been further classified in subfamily Coronavirinae. On the basis of rooted and unrooted genetic trees and partial nucleotide sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, subfamily Coronavirinae has been recognized and classified into four genera-alpha (\u03b1) coronavirus, beta (\u03b2) coronavirus, gamma (\u03b3) coronavirus, and delta (\u03b4) coronavirus (Woo et al. 2009 (Woo et al. , 2012a . The \u03b1 coronaviruses and \u03b2 coronaviruses infect only warm-blooded animals. The \u03b3 coronaviruses and \u03b4 coronaviruses infect birds, but some of them can also infect mammals. Phylogenetic relationship of various human and animal coronaviruses and the list of known coronaviruses are shown in Fig. 12.2 and Tables 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3, respectively. Infection with \u03b1 coronaviruses and \u03b2 coronaviruses leads to respiratory disorders in human and gastrointestinal disorders in animals (Su et al. 2016; Forni et al. 2017; Gorbalenya et al. 2006) . Currently available genetic sequence databases of all human coronaviruses reveal with its animal origins: Viruses of the family Coronaviridae are listed, with their abbreviations and natural animal reservoir (Cavanagh 1997) (Table 12. 2). Domestic animals can act as an intermediate host to transmit these viruses from their reservoir host to the humans. Sometimes domestic animal may acquire infection with closely related zoonotic coronaviruses (Woo et al. 2009 (Woo et al. , 2012a . Extensive research study on the source of infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has found bat as a reservoir, and it has laid to the better understanding of coronavirus microbiology. At present, seven species of \u03b1 coronavirus and four species of \u03b2 coronavirus have been identified only in bats (Su et al. 2016; Lau et al. 2013; Perlman and Netland 2009; Woo et al. 2012b; Graham et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2015; de Wit et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2017 ).",

Genomic sequences of closely related viruses silently circulate in bats. The molecular epidemiological information reveals that a virus of bat origin infecting unidentified animal species sold in Wuhan sea food markets could be the possible source of this infection. Several research studies have focused on the evaluation of the zoonotic potentials of animal coronaviruses since the outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The high diversity of coronaviruses detected in bats and their genomic variability increases the risk of interspecies transmission. 2019-nCoV highlights the importance of bats as a reservoir for new viruses causing infection in humans, and it can also be used as a good model to design studies and strategies to prevent future emergence of new zoonotic diseases. It is important to increase the efforts to characterize viral genome of different animal coronaviruses and also to look for the viral evolution and adaptation to their natural hosts. The possibility to predict the interspecies transmission can be helpful in planning of specific surveillance programs and act quickly in an outbreak. Therefore, extensive research studies in finding experimental models for the emerging zoonotic viral diseases are absolutely mandatory.
