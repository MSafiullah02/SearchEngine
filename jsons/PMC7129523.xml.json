An overabundance of caution is certainly prudent, but with the latest discovery\u2014that the virus was documented in dromedary camels as long ago as 19923\u2014interpretation of the epidemiology has become more difficult. Are the recently identified cases in Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia new, or a part of a long series of human disease? Improved collaboration between clinicians, scientists, and public health authorities will be necessary to understand the epidemiology and define the sources and modes of transmission.",

Such an agreement would include the controversial issues of how to share animal and human specimens, investigational products (eg, pathogens and viral isolates), and intellectual property (eg, public health surveillance data and scientific publications). Without agreement about the mutually beneficial roles, responsibilities, and legitimate contributions of clinicians, scientists, and public health authorities, parties end up either encroaching on one another or not communicating\u2014both of which are happening now with respect to MERS coronavirus.",

Governance should be built around One Health, an interdisciplinary collaboration between human and veterinarian medicine and health, because economic loss is an important consideration (as can be seen from the negative economic effect of the present influenza H7N9 outbreak9). Additional steps should be taken to protect the economic interests of farmers and livestock owners. Livestock insurance schemes, already used for protection against drought, could be used for reimbursement.10 The development of a global biological risk management fund to share the burden of economic loss would enhance the mission of the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHRs).",

The pandemic influenza preparedness framework11 is a commendable start, but is limited in scope and does not provide guidance for data sharing for non-influenza viruses or other biological specimens.
