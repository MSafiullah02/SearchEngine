            "text": "Landmarks in the evolution and development of biological classification may be ascribed to the contributions of the following:\n\nLinnaeus (1707\u20131778)\nThe Swedish naturalist, Carolus Linnaeus, is \u00adcredited with introducing the earliest organized classification of living things in his Systema Naturae or natural system. He divided living things into plants and animals. Based on morphology and motility, the distinction between the two groups of organisms was clear: plants were green and did not move; on the other hand, animals were not green, but moved.\nErnst Haeckel (1834\u20131919)\nSoon after the discovery of the microscope, previously invisible microscopic organisms were observed, some of which had properties common to both plants and animals. Some such as Euglena were green like, but they also moved about like animals. Because the clear-cut criteria which separated plants from animals were absent in these \u201cnew\u201d organisms, the German biologist who was a contemporary of Charles Darwin, in 1866 coined the name Protista for a third kingdom, in addition to the Plant and Animal Kingdoms.\nRobert Harding Whittaker (1920\u20131980)\nWhittaker was an American. Born in Wichita, Kansas, he worked in various places including the University of California, Irvine, and Cornell University. In 1968, he proposed the five-kingdom taxonomic classification of living things into the Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista (Algae and Protozoa), and Monera (Bacteria). His categorization of living things was based on three criteria: cell-type (whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic); organizational level (unicellular or multi-cellular); nutritional type (autotrophy or heterotrophy).\nCarl R. Woese (1928\u2013)\nThe current classification of living things is based on the work of Carl Robert Woese of the University of Illinois. While earlier classifications were based mainly on morphological characteristics and cell-type, following our greater understanding of living things at the molecular level, Woese\u2019s classification is based on the sequence of the gene of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the 16S of the small subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, or the 18S of the small subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome (Petti et al. 2006).\n",

            "text": "\n\nNutritional types of Bacteria\nLiving things are classified into major nutritional types on the basis of the following attributes:\nCarbon source utilizedA carbon skeleton is required for the compounds used for growth and development such as carbohydrates, amino acids, fats, etc. The organism is autotrophic if it manufactures its food and obtains its carbon through fixing CO2 such as is the case with plants, algae, and some bacteria. When the organism cannot manufacture its own food from CO2 but must utilize food already manufactured from CO2, in the form of carbohydrates, proteins etc., it is heterotrophic\n. This is the case with animals and most bacteria.Source of reducing equivalentDuring the generation of energy in the cell, electrons are transferred from one compound to another. An organism is said to be organotrophic when it uses organic compounds as a source of electrons. When the source of electrons is inorganic, it is said to be lithotrophic.\nSource of energySome organisms derive energy for the generation of ATP used for the biosynthesis of new compounds and other cellular activities from sunlight; such organisms are phototrophic. When the generation of ATP occurs through energy obtained from chemical reactions, the organism is said to be chemotrophic.The carbon source utilized, the source of reducing equivalent, and the source of energy determine the nutritional type of bacteria, and a wide variety of combinations of these three is possible. Table 4.4 gives a selection of the \u00adpossible permutations.\n\n\nCell wall: Gram reaction\nThe Gram stain was devised by the German doctor, Christian Gram in 1884 and divides bacteria into two groups: Gram positive and Gram negative. On account of the greater thickness of peptidoglycan in the Gram positive wall (see Fig. 4.2), the iodine-crystal violet stain in the Gram stain is retained when decolorized with dilute acid, whereas it is removed in the Gram negative cell wall. The Gram stain also divides all bacteria into two groups regarding their susceptibility to the classical antibiotic penicillin: Gram-positive bacteria, being susceptible, while Gram negative bacteria are not (Fig. 4.3).\n\n\nCell morphology\nIndividual cell shapesCell shapes in bacteria are limited and are spheres (coccus\u2013 cocci, plural), rods, spiral, or comma or vibrio (see Fig. 4.4).\nCell aggregatesCocci can occur in pairs (diplococci), in chains (streptococci), or in clumps (staphylococci). Rods may occur in short chains of two or three or in long chains or filaments.FlagellationThe flagella may be at one end (polar) and may occur singly or as a tuft. The flagella may occur all around the cell when it is peritrichous (see Fig. 4.5).\nSpores and location of sporesSpores are bodies resistant to heat and other adverse conditions which may be terminal or placed mid-way in the cell; in either position, it may be less than the diameter of the cell or may be wider. The terminal wider spore gives the shape of a drumstick, and is diagnostic of the anaerobic rod-like spore-former, Clostridium tetanii, the causative agent of tetanus (see Fig. 4.6).\nAcid-fast (Ziel\u2013Nieelsen) stainIf the bacterium is suspected to belong to Myco\u00adbacterium spp., or any of the other acid-fast \u00adbacteria it might be stained with hot basic fuchsin; acid fast bacteria retain the dye when decolorized.\n\nUtilization of various substrates\n5Utilization of various sugars, carbohydrates, and nitrogenous sourcesThe ability of the organism to produce acid and/or gas from a medium containing a particular substrate is diagnostic of its ability to utilize it. The utilization of a wide range of sugars and other carbohydrates, and nitrogen sources including urea is tested by the presence of gas in the small (Durham) tube placed in the test tube containing the medium; a change in the color of indicator would indicate acid \u00adproduction by the organism (see Fig. 4.7).\n\n\nDetermination of optimum growth conditions\nOptimum pH, temperature, and oxygen \u00adrequirements are determined by growing the organism under different conditions of pH and temperature and finding the best condition. For oxygen requirement, the organism may be grown in an agar stab and sealed with sterile molten petroleum jelly to determine if it will grow under anaerobic conditions.\nSecretion of special enzymes\nThe secretion of unique enzymes is diagnostic. Some of the following enzymes are diagnostic (see Fig. 4.7a).\nCoagulase: Coagulase is an enzyme produced by Staphylococcus aureus that converts fibrinogen to fibrin. In the laboratory, it is used to distinguish between different types of Staphylococcus isolates. Coagulase negativity excludes S. aureus. The coagulase test is used to differentiate Staphylococcus aureus from the other species of Staphylococcus. The test uses rabbit plasma that has been inoculated with a staphylococcal colony. The tube is then incubated at 37\u00b0C for about 90 min. If positive (i.e., the suspect colony is S. aureus), the serum will coagulate, resulting in a clot. If negative (i.e., if the tested colony is S. epidermidis), the plasma remains liquid.\nCatalase: Catalase is a common enzyme found in living organisms. Its functions include catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ 2{\\rm{H}}_{2}{\\rm{O}}_{2}\\to 2{\\rm{H}}_{2}{\\rm{O + O}}_{2}$$\n\\end{document}\nIn microbiology, the catalase test is used to differentiate between staphylococci and micrococci, which are catalase-positive, from streptococci and \u00adenterococci, which are catalase-negative\nOptochin: Optochin (ethyl hydrocuprein hydrochloride) is used for the presumptive identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is optochin sensitive, from Streptococcus viridans which is resistant. Bacteria that are optochin sensitive will not continue to grow (i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae will die), while bacteria that are not optochin sensitive will be unaffected (i.e., Streptococcus \u00adviridans will survive).\nOxidase: An oxidase is any enzyme that \u00adcatalyzes an oxidation/reduction reaction involving molecular oxygen (O2) as the electron acceptor. In these reactions, oxygen is reduced to water (H2O) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The oxidases are a subclass of the oxidoreductases. In microbiology, the oxidase test is used as a phenotypic character for the identification of bacterial strains; it determines whether a given bacterium produces cytochrome oxidases (and therefore utilizes oxygen with an electron transfer chain) (see Fig. 4.7a).\nSerology\nBacterial species and serotypes can be identified by \u00adspecific antigen/antibody reactions. Antigens are substances that induce the production of antibodies in an animal body. Bacteria and bacterial \u00adcomponents serve as excellent antigens. The test includes \u00adproduction of antibodies in an animal host and testing of the antiserum by either the agglutination or precipitation test. In the agglutination test, a drop of the culture of a particular bacterium is mixed on a slide with the anti-serum of an individual infected by it and examined under a microscope. If clumping occurs, the test bacterium is considered to be the same or closely related to the bacterium used as the antigen.\n",

            "text": "The methods for the characterization and identification of bacteria which have been discussed so far are based on phenotypic properties, i.e., the outward manifestation of the innate (genetic) attributes of the organism. The properties to be discussed in this section are those of the nucleic acids of the organisms. They alone however do not define the organism and must be taken along with the phenotypic properties. They are very useful in refining the description of an organism. They are particularly useful in identifying strains within a species.\n\nG + C ratio\nThe G + C ratio is the percentage of guanine + cytosine in an organism\u2019s DNA. Several methods exist for determining this ratio. One method is to determine the Tm or temperature of melting of the DNA.At room temperature, DNA is double stranded. However, as its temperature is raised gradually, the two strands separate and the rapidity of separation with increasing temperature depends on the amount of G and C in the organism\u2019s DNA. G and C are linked by triple bonds and are therefore less likely to separate than A and T bonds, which have double bonds. The higher the G + C content, the higher the temperature at which the DNA \u00adseparates completely.DNA begins to separate at 70\u201375\u00b0C and \u00adseparates completely at about 90\u00b0C, when it is said to have melted. When cooled slowly, it begins to anneal (i.e., to reform itself into double strands). In annealing, the strands do not return to their previous \u201c\u00adpartners\u201d but will anneal with any strand with complimentary bases no matter the source, including those coming from the same organism, other orga\u00adnisms, or even those synthesized in the laboratory. This phenomenon of annealing with complimentary strands from any source is important in other procedures such as in the identification of unknowns, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), etc.When the Tm method is used to determine the G + C composition, the temperature of the double (ds) DNA is raised slowly and subjected to spectrophotometric reading at 260 nm. The graph of the spectrophotometric readings is plotted against the change in temperature (see Fig. 4.8). The Tm is the midpoint of the resulting graph. Two organisms with similar phenotypic properties and the same G + C ratio are likely to belong to the species.\n\nDNA\u2013DNA hybridization\nThis technique measures the degree of genetic similarity between pools of DNA sequences. It is usually used to determine the genetic distance between two species.It was seen above that when melted DNA is allowed to cool slowly, the single-stranded DNA will anneal with any single-stranded DNA no \u00admatter its source, as long the bases are complimentary. To determine how closely related an unknown organism is with a known one, DNA from the two organisms are mixed and heated slowly and allowed to anneal slowly. The unknown or the known is labeled with a fluorescent dye or with radioactive phosphorous and measured at 260 nm in the \u00adspectrophotometer. The extent of the taxonomic relatedness is reflected in the extent of the \u00adannealing. If the two organisms are of the same species, there will be complete annealment. Some authors have suggested that organisms of the same species will have 90% annealing, while those of the same genus will have about 75% annealing.\nRibotyping\nRibotyping is an RNA-based molecular characterization of bacteria. In ribotyping, bacteria genomic DNAs are digested and separated by gel electrophoresis. Universal probes that target specific conserved domains of ribosomal RNA coding sequences are used to detect the band patterns. Ribosomal genes are known to be highly conserved in microbes, meaning that the genetic information coding for rRNA will vary much less within bacteria of the same strain than it will between bacterial strains. This characteristic allows for a greater ability to distinguish between different bacterial strains.In ribotyping, restriction enzymes (i.e., enzymes which cut DNA at specific positions) are used to cut the genes coding for rRNA into pieces, and gel electrophoresis is used to separate the pieces by size. Genetic probes then visualize locations of different-size fragments of DNA in the gel, which appear as bands. The banding pattern of DNA fragments corresponding to the relevant rRNA is known as the ribotype.A probe is a strand of nucleic acid which is \u00adsynthesized in the laboratory and can be labeled with a dye or radioactively. Probes are used to hybridize to a complementary nucleic acid from a mixture. Probes can be general or specific. Thus, it is possible to design probes which will bind to sequences in the ribosomal RNA of all organisms irrespective of Domain. On the other hand, \u00adspecific probes can be designed which will react only with nucleic acid of Bacteria, Archae, or Eukarya because of the unique sequences found in these groups. Even within species in the various domains, signature sequences exist which will enable the identification of the species using probes (see Table 4.5). Ribotyping is so specific that it has been nicknamed \u201cmolecular finger printing.\u201d\n\nFISH \u2013 Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization\nThis is a special type of ribotyping. In FISH, the whole organism is used without need to isolate the organism\u2019s DNA. The cells are treated with chemicals which make the cell walls and cell membranes permeable, thus permitting the entry of probes labeled with fluorescent dyes. After hybridization of the ribosomes with the dye, the entire organism fluoresces and can be seen under the light microscope. FISH is widely used in ecological and clinical studies. It can be used for the rapid identification of bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens; ordinary procedures take about 48 h, but FISH can be completed in a few hours.\n",

The \u00adproteins are run in a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. The first run separates the proteins on the basis of their molecular weights and the second on the basis of their iso-electric points (Ochiai and Kawamoto 1995). The resulting protein pattern is diagnostic of a particular organism. If many samples are examined, the patterns can be scanned with a computer. Patterns from unknown organisms are compared with patterns of known organisms to determine the relatedness of the known to the unknown.\nFatty acid analyses \u2013 fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)\nThis method is widely used in clinical, food, and water microbiology for the identification of bacteria. Fatty acids from the cell membrane of \u00adbacteria as well from the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria are extracted and converted to their methyl esters. The esters are then run in a gas chromatograph. The patterns of the gas chromatograms are diagnostic and can be used to identify unknowns. For example, Burkholderia pseudomallei, the cause of melioidosis, has been distinguished from the closely related but non-pathogenic Burkholderia thailandensis by gas chromatography (GC) analysis of fatty acid derivatives. A 2-hydroxymyristic acid derivative (14:0 2OH) was present in 95% of B. pseudomallei isolates but absent from all B. thailandensis isolates (see Table 4.6) (Inglis et al. 2003; Banowetz et al. 2006).\n\n",

            "text": "The manuals are named after Dr. D H Bergey who was the first Chairman of the Board set up by the then Society of American Bacteriologists (now American Society for Microbiology) to publish the books. The publication of Bergey Manuals is now managed by the Bergey\u2019s Manual Trust. Of the 18 phyla in the bacteria (see Figs. 4.9 and 4.10), the Aquiflex is evolutionarily the most primitive, while the most advanced is the Proteobacteria. In the following discussion, emphasis will be laid on the bacteria which are aquatic.\n\n\nAquifex\nThe two species generally classified in Aquifex are A. pyrophilus and A. aeolicus. Both are highly thermophilic, growing best in water temperature of 85\u201395\u00b0C. They are among the most thermophilic bacteria known. They can grow on hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, SO2, S2O3, or NO3 and mineral salts, functioning as a chemolithoautotroph (an organism which uses an inorganic carbon source for biosynthesis and an inorganic chemical energy source). As a hyperthermophilic bacterium, Aquifex aeolicus grows in extremely hot tempuratures such as near volcanoes or hot springs. They grow optimally at temperatures around 85\u00b0C but can grow at temperatures up to 95\u00b0C. It needs oxygen to carry on its metabolic machinery, but it can function in relatively low levels of oxygen. The genus Aquifex consists of Gram negative rods.\nThermodesulfobacterium\n\nThermodesulfobacterium is a thermophilic sulfate reducer. Sulfate reducers include a wide range of morphological types, including rods, vibrios, ovals, spheres, and even tear-dropped or onion-shaped cells. Some are motile, others are not. Most sulfate-reducing bacteria are mesophilic, but a few are thermophiles, among which is the Gram negative and anaerobic Thermodesulfobacterium. The bacterium is non-spore-forming. It is an aquatic organism and has been isolated from volcanic hot springs, deep-sea hydrothermal sulfides, and other marine environments. In marine sediments and in aerobic wastewater treatment systems, sulfate reduction accounts for up to 50% of the mineralization of organic matter. Furthermore, sulfate reduction strongly stimulates microbially enhanced corrosion of metals. Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) are discussed in more detail later.\nThermotoga\n\nThermotoga is typically a rod-shaped cell enveloped in an outer cell membrane (the \u201ctoga\u201d or jacket). Thermotoga enzymes are known for being active at high temperatures. Enzymes from Thermotoga spp. are extremely thermostable and therefore, useful for many industrial processes such as in the chemical and food industries. The organisms are thermophilic or hyperthermophilic, growing best around 80\u00b0C and in the neutral pH range. The salt tolerance of Thermotoga species varies greatly; while some display an extremely high salt tolerance, others are restricted to low-salinity habitats. This aerobic Gram-negative organism is typically non-spore-forming and metabolizes several carbohydrates, both simple and complex, including glucose, sucrose, starch, cellulose, and xylan. It can grow by anaerobic respiration using H2 as electron donor and Fe3+ as electron acceptor. It is found in hot springs and in the hydrothermic vents of ocean floors. Thermotoga maritime has been widely studied.\nGreen non-sulfur bacteria (Chloroflexi)\nThe Green non-sulfur bacteria are now known as Chloroflexi are typically filamentous, and can move about by bacterial gliding. They are facultatively aerobic and have a different method of carbon fixation (photoheterotrophy) from other photosynthetic bacteria. Like green plants, they also carry out photosynthesis, but there are differences between the two; for instance, unlike plants, they do not produce oxygen during photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis in the bacteria and in higher plants is discussed more fully below.\nDeinecoccus-Thermus\nThe Deinococcus-Thermus are a small group of Gram negative bacteria comprised of cocci which are highly resistant to environmental hazards because they are able to quickly repair damage to their DNA. There are two main groups. The Deinococcales include a single genus, Deino\u00adcoccus, with several species that are resistant to radiation; they have become famous for their ability to \u201ceat\u201d nuclear waste and other toxic materials, survive in the vacuum of atmosphere space, and survive extremes of heat and cold. Thermus spp. include several genera resistant to heat. Deino\u00adcoccus radiodurans is an extremophilic bac\u00adterium, and is the most radioresistant organism known. It can survive heat, cold, dehydration, vacuum, and acid, and because of its resistance to more than one extreme condition, D. radiodurans is known as a polyextremophile.\nThermus aquaticus is important in the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) where repeated cycles of heating DNA to near boiling make it advantageous to use a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme. These bacteria have thick cell walls that give them Gram-positive stains, but they include a second membrane and so are closer in structure to those of Gram-negative bacteria.\nSpirochetes\nSpirochetes are Gram-negative bacteria, which have long, helically coiled cells. Spirochetes are chemoheterotrophic in nature, with lengths between 5 and 250 \u03bcm and diameters around 0.1\u20130.6 \u03bcm. Spirochetes are distinguished from other bacterial phyla by the presence of flagella, sometimes called axial filaments, running lengthwise between the cell membrane and an outer membrane. These cause a twisting motion which allows the spirochete to move about. The spirochete shape may also be described as consisting of an axial filament around which the cell is wound giving spirochetes their characteristic corkscrew shapes. Most spirochetes are free-living and anaerobic, but they also include the following disease-\u00adcausing members:\n\nLeptospira species, which causes leptospirosis (also known as Weil\u2019s disease)\nBorrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease\nBorrelia recurrentis, which causes relapsing fever\nTreponema pallidum, which causes syphilis\n\nGreen sulfur bacteria\n\nGreen Sulfur Bacteria are found in anaerobic \u00adenvironments such as muds, anaerobic, and sulfide-containing fresh or marine waters, and wetlands. These anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria live in environments where light and reduced sulfur compounds are present. They are found most often under the Purple Sulfur bacterial layer. Green sulfur bacteria are capable of using sulfide or elemental S as the electron donor. The elemental S arises from H2S oxidation and is deposited extracellularly, before the oxidation of sulfate. There are four genera of green sulfur bacteria, Chlorobium, Prosthecohloris (with stalks or prostheca), Pelodictyon (with vacuoles), and Clathrochloris (motile).The Green Sulfur Bacteria strains are green because of the presence of bacteriochlorophylls (bchls) \u201cc\u201d and \u201cd\u201d and small traces of bchl \u201ca\u201d located in chlorobium vesicles attached to the cytoplasmic membrane. Some are brown and they contain bacteriochlorophyll \u201ce.\u201d These brown strains are found in the deeper layers of wetlands and water. Both of the two groups can be found also living in extreme conditions of salinity and high temperatures. The morphology of both color types is most often either straight or curved rods.They are non-motile phototrophic short to long rods which utilize H2S as electron donor oxidizing it to SO2 and to SO42+. The sulfur so produced lies outside the cells. Light energy absorbed by Bacteriochlorophylls c, d, or e is channeled to Bacteriochlorophyll a, which actually carries out photosynthetic energy conversion, and ATP synthesis takes place. A well-known member is Chlorobium tepidum.In marine environments, they are found in the water column where hydrogen sulfide diffuses up from anaerobic sediments and where oxygen diffuses down from surface waters where oxygenic photosynthesis is taking place. In the Black Sea, the largest anoxic water body in the world, they are found at a depth of 100 m (Manske et al. 2008). They also live in special tissues in invertebrates such as Riftia pachyptila (vestimentiferan tube worms) and Calyptogena magnifica (\u201cgiant\u201d white clams) that live around deep sea hydrothermal vents. There they provide energy, by oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds, and organic matter, by converting carbon dioxide to organic compounds, which the invertebrates use. They are sometimes abundant in coastal waters, and several members of the group have gas vacuoles in their cells to help them float.\nFlavobacteria\nFlavobacteria are Gram negative rods that are motile by gliding and found in aquatic environments, both freshwater and marine, and in the soil. Colonies are usually yellow to orange in color, hence their name. Flavobacteria are a group of commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. Flavobacterium psychrophilum causes the septicemic diseases of rainbow trout fry syndrome and bacterial cold water disease. They decompose several polysaccharides including agar but not cellulose. The type species is F. aquatile.\nDefferibacter\nThese are thermophilic, anaerobic, chemolithoautotrophic Gram negative straight to bent rods. They can use a wide range of electron acceptors including Fe3+ and Mn2+. They are found in a wide range of aquatic environments including deep-sea hydrothermal vents. A well-known member is Deferribacter desulfuricans\n\nCytophaga\n\nCytophaga are unicellular, Gram-negative gliding bacteria. They are rod-shaped, but specific strains differ in diameter and length with some being pleomorphic (many shaped). The type species is C. johnsonae, which has a moderately long thin shape. Many strains are red, yellow, or orange because of unique pigments synthesized by the group. Cytophaga strains tend to be versatile in making these and one strain may synthesize 25 different structural varieties of pigment. The main habitats of Cytophaga are soils at or close to neutral pH, decaying plant material, and dung of animals. In freshwater environments, they are found on riverbanks and lake shores, in estuaries, bottom sediments, and algal mats. They are also common in sewage treatment plants, especially at the latter stages where only recalcitrant molecules remain. Cytophaga tend to degrade polymers such as cellulose and have been shown to be the major cellulose degraders in some lakes. A few species have been isolated from the oral cavity of humans where they appear to be part of the normal flora, but can occasionally cause septicemias. Some Cytophaga strains are pathogens of fish.\nPlanctomyces/Pirella\n\nPlanctomyces, Pirella, Gemmata, and Isosphaera form a phylogenetically related group of microorganisms that have many unusual properties. They are the only bacteria, other than the confusing case of the Chlamydia, whose cells lack peptidoglycan. Cells of this group divide by budding. Some members of the group produce long appendages, called stalks, and new cells are motile, developing stalks as they mature. Some members of this group have structures resembling nuclear membranes (Bauld and Staley 1976): others have fimbrin.Cells of this group can be pigmented (light rose, bright red, or yellow to ochre) or non-pigmented. An example of the species is Planctomyces limnophilus, which is ovoid, has a diameter of 1.5 \u03bcm, and forms red pigmented colonies. It grows slowly at temperatures between 17\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C and takes at least a week to form colonies. Stalks of the organism are very thin and cannot be seen by light microscopy. These stalks appear to be made of thin fibers twisted into a bundle that emanates from one pole of the ovoid cell. Cells multiply by budding and new cells are motile and stalkless, but eventually grow stalks as part of a maturation process similar to that seen for Caulobacter.\nThese microbes are common inhabitants of freshwater lakes, marine habitats, and salt ponds, but most have been difficult to isolate in pure \u00adculture. For example, three of the four species in Planctomyces have only been observed in lake water and never isolated.\nVerrucomicrobia\n\nVerrucomicrobia, with the best example as Verrucomicrobia spinosum, has been isolated from freshwater, soil environments, and human feces. It produces cytoplasmic appendages called prostheca. Prostheca are like warts and the name of the group comes from the Greek word for warts. Both mother and daughter contain prostheca at the time of the cell division.\nChlamydia\nChlamydia are obligate intracellular pathogens with poor metabolic capabilities. They cannot synthesize biomolecules such as amino acids which they obtain from their hosts. Many Chlamydiae coexist in an asymptomatic state within specific hosts, and it is widely believed that these hosts provide a natural reservoir for these species.Chlamydiae exist in two states: a metabolically inert elementary body (EB) and a metabolically active reticulate body (RB) found only inside cells. EB is similar to the virions of viruses and enters the body by phagocytosis. Once ingested and inside the cell, EB divides and becomes RB. After it has killed the cell, it becomes EB again and is ready to be transmitted. Chlamydiae are spread by aerosol or by contact and require no alternate vector.Diseases caused by Chlymidia include sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (Chlamydia trachomatosis), pneumonia (Chlamydia pneumoniae), and bird pneumonia (Chlamydia psittaci).\nCyanobacteria\nCyanobacteria (Greek: \u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03ccs (kyan\u00f3s) = blue + bacterium) obtain their energy through photosynthesis. They are often referred to as blue-green algae, because they were once thought to be algae. They are a significant component of the marine nitrogen cycle system and an important primary producer in many areas of the ocean. Their ability to perform oxygenic (plant-like) photosynthesis is thought to have converted the reducing atmosphere of the early earth into an oxidizing one, which dramatically changed the life forms on Earth and \u00adprovoked an explosion of biodiversity.Cyanobacteria are found in almost every \u00adconceivable habitat, from oceans to freshwater to bare rock to soil. Most are found in freshwater, while others are marine, occur in damp soil, or even temporarily moistened rocks in deserts. A few are endosymbionts in lichens, plants, various protists, or sponges and provide energy for the host. Some live in the fur of sloths, providing a form of camouflage.Cyanobacteria include unicellular and colonial species. Colonies may form filaments, sheets, or even hollow balls. Some filamentous colonies show the ability to differentiate into several different cell types: vegetative cells, the normal, photosynthetic cells that are formed under favorable growing conditions; akinetes, the climate-resistant spores that may form when environmental conditions become harsh; and thick-walled heterocysts, which contain the enzyme nitrogenase, vital for nitrogen fixation. Heterocysts may also form under the appropriate environmental conditions (anoxic) wherever nitrogen is necessary. Heterocyst-forming species are specialized for nitrogen fixation and are able to fix nitrogen gas, which cannot be used by plants, into ammonia (NH3), nitrites (NO2\u2212), or nitrates (NO3\u2212), which can be absorbed by plants and converted to protein and nucleic acids. The rice paddies of Asia, which produce about 75% of the world\u2019s rice, do so because of the high populations of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in the rice paddy fields.Photosynthesis in cyanobacteria generally uses water as an electron donor and produces oxygen as a by-product, though some may also use hydrogen sulfide as is the case among other photosynthetic bacteria. Carbon dioxide is reduced to form carbohydrates via the Calvin cycle. In most forms, the photosynthetic machinery is embedded into folds of the cell membrane, similar to thylakoids found in the chloroplasts of higher plants.The cyanobacteria are traditionally classified by morphology into five sections, I\u2013V: Chroo\u00adcoc\u00adcales, Pleurocapsales, Oscillatoriales, Nostocales, and Stigonematales. The latter two contain \u00adhetrocysts. The members of Chroococcales are unicellular and usually aggregated in colonies. In Pleurocapsales, the cells have the ability to form internal spores (baeocytes). In Oscillatorialles, the cells are singly arranged and do not form specialized cells, (akinets and heterocysts). In Nostocalles and Stigonematalles, the cells have the ability to develop heterocysts under certain conditions.\nGram positive bacteria (including Mycoplasmas and Actinobacteria)\nLike the Proteobacteria, the Gram positive bacteria are very diverse; they contain many bacteria encountered in everyday life as agents of disease and inputs of production in industry or as important organisms in food microbiology. Some of them (the Mycoplasma) lack cell walls.Gram-positive bacteria fall into two major phylogenetic divisions, \u201clow-G + C\u201d and \u201chigh-G + C.\u201d: \n(a)Low G + C group: G + C below 50%; \n(b)High G + C group: G + C higher than 50%\nLow G + C Group: G + C Below 50%\nNon-sporulating Low G + C Group\n\nStaphylococcus: The staphylococci have spherical cells often found in groups resembling clusters of grapes. Bacteria of this genus were originally grouped with other sphe\u00adrical microorganisms, especially of the genus Micrococcus, since these two genera often shared similar habitats. However, physiological studies and phylogenetic analysis have shown that these two genera are very different from one another. The differences between staphylococci and micrococci are discussed below.\nLactic Acid Bacteria: The lactic acid \u00adbacteria are Gram-positive rods and cocci that produce lactic acid as their primary end \u00adproduct. An important group characteristic is the absence of cytochromes, porphyrins and respiratory enzymes. They are therefore \u00adincapable of oxidative phosphorylation or any type of respiration and are totally dependent on fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria do, however, contain mechanisms to deal with the toxic byproducts of oxygen, which \u00adcategorizes them as aeroto\u00adlerant anaerobes. They include Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Lactococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus. Lactic acid bacteria are primarily differentiated based on the types of end products they form. Homo\u00adfermentative lactic acid bacteria produce only lactic acid as an end product, while heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria produce lactate, ethanol, and CO2 as well (Axelssson and Ahrne 2000; Narayanan et al. 2004).\nSporulating Low G + C Group\n\nBacillus: These are spore-forming aerobic rods. Bacillus is a genus of rod-shaped, beta-hemolytic Gram-positive bacteria. Bacillus species are catalase-positive obligate or facultative aerobes. Ubiquitous in nature, Bacillus includes both free-living in soil, water and air, as well as some pathogenic species. Under stressful environmental conditions, the cells produce endospores resistant to heat, radiation, chemicals and other unfavorable conditions.\nClostridium: These are Gram-positive spore-forming obligately anaerobic rods. Individual cells are rod-shaped, and the name comes from the Greek for spindle. Clostridium includes common free-living bacteria as well as important pathogens, including C. botulinum, an organism producing a very potent toxin in food; C. difficile, which can overgrow other bacteria in the gut during antibiotic therapy; C. tetani, the causative organism of tetanus; C. perfringens, formerly called C. welchii, which causes a wide range of symptoms, from food poisoning to gas gangrene. Because C. perfringens produces much gas, it is also used as a replacement for yeasts in breadmaking. C. sordellii has been linked to the deaths of more than a dozen women. They are important in the anaerobic conditions of muds.\nHeliobacteria: Heliobacteria are strictly anaerobic, spore-forming photoheterotrophic members of the Firmicutes. 16s rRNA studies put them among the Firmicutes (Bacillus and Clostridium) but they do not stain Gram-positively like the other members. They have no outer membrane and like certain other firmicutes (clostridia), they form heat resistant endospores. They are the only firmicutes known to conduct photosynthesis. Soluble periplasmic components appear absent in heliobacteria and photosynthesis takes place at the cell membrane, which does not form folds or compartments as it does in purple phototrophic bacteria. A particularity of heliobacterial photosynthesis is the \u00adoccurrence of a unique Bacteriochlorophll (BChl) g. BChl g is chemically closer to Chl a than to BChl a. Correspondingly, heliobacteria appear to be more closely related to oxygenic photosynthesis than the green sulfur bacteria (based on 16S-rRNA phylogeny as well as on trees built from sequences of the photosynthetic reaction center). A small group, it is the only known phototrophic one among the Gram positives. Heliobacteria consist of three genera, Heliobacterium (3 spp.), Heliobacillus (1 sp.), and Heliophilum (1 sp.). They cannot tolerate sulfide, all known species can fix nitrogen. They are common in the waterlogged soils of paddy fields.High G + C Group: G + C Above 50%These include Actinomycetes, Mycobacteria, Micrococcus, and Corynebacterium:\nActinomycetes\n\nActinomycetes are filamentous and spore-forming (non heat resistant spores), found in soil. They are very important as antibiotic producers. Typical example is Streptomyces sp. They include some of the most common soil life, playing an important role in decomposition of organic materials, such as \u00adcellulose and chitin and thereby playing a vital part in organic matter turnover and carbon cycle. Actinomycetes of the family Actinoplanaceae, especially Actinoplanes, are readily isolated from the flowing waters of rivers and streams, where they are important in the decomposition of wood and other cellulolisic materials.\nMycobacterium\nThis is a slow-growing acid-fast strain (Ziel\u2013Nieelsen stain) implicated in diseases (M. leprae, leprosy; M. tuberculosis, tuberculosis). Many are however free-living and inhabit aquatic environments. These environmental or waterborne mycobacteria (WBM) inhabit a diverse range of natural environments and are a frequent cause of opportunistic infection in human beings and livestock. Several hospital and community outbreaks of mycobacterial infections, including infections as diverse as life-threatening pneumonia in patients with artificial ventilation, cystic fibrosis, and chronic granulomatous disease; outbreaks of skin infection following liposuction; furunculosis after domestic footbaths; mastitis after body piercing; and abscess formation in intravenous drug users.\nCorynebacteria\n\nCorynebacterium is a genus of Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, nonmotile, rod-shaped actinobacteria. Most do not cause disease, but are part of normal human skin flora. Coryne\u00adbacterium diphtheriae is the cause of diphtheria in humans. The genes encoding exotoxins that are the cause of diphtheria (caused by Corynebacterium) as well as cholera and some other bacterial diseases are mobile in aquatic and terrestrial environments and have been found in sediments and in river water using PCR.\nMicrococcus\nThese are cocci in bunches and very similar to staphylococci. They are distinguished from each other according to the properties shown in Table 4.7.\n\n\nNitrospira\n\nNitrospira are nitrite-oxidizing bacteria that are important in marine habitats. In aquaria, for example, if the ammonia/nitrite/nitrate cycle is exhausted, the ecosystem suffers and fish can get sick or die. Therefore, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria as well as the other bacteria in this system are important for healthy marine ecosystems. In addition, Nitrospira-like bacteria are the main nitrite oxidizers in wastewater treatment plants.\nProteobacteria (including purple bacteria)\nThe Proteobacteria are a major group of bacteria. They include a wide variety of pathogens, such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Vibrio, and Helicobacter. Others are important agriculturally or industrally; still others are free-living, and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation. The group is defined primarily in terms of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences, and is named after the Greek god Proteus, who could change his shape, because of the great diversity of forms found within the group. Proteus is also the name of a bacterial genus within the Proteobacteria.All Proteobacteria are Gram-negative, with an outer membrane mainly composed of lipopolysaccharides. Many move with flagella, but some are nonmotile or move by bacterial gliding. The latter include the myxobacteria, a unique group of bacteria that can aggregate to form multicellular fruiting bodies.There is also a wide variety in the types of meta\u00adbolism. Most members are facultatively or obligately anaerobic and heterotrophic, but there are numerous exceptions. A variety of genera, which are not closely related to each other, convert energy from light through photosynthesis. These are called purple bacteria, referring to their mostly reddish pigmentation.The Proteobacteria are divided into five sections, referred to by the Greek letters alpha through epsilon, again based on rRNA sequences.\nAlpha (\u03b1) Proteobacteria\nThe Alphaproteobacteria comprise the most phototrophic genera, but also several genera meta\u00adbo\u00adlizing C1-compounds (compounds with a single carbon atom e.g., Methylobacterium, symbionts of plants (e.g., Rhizobia) and animals, and a group of intracellular pathogens, the Rickettsiaceae. Moreover, the precursors of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells are thought to have originated in this bacterial group.\nBeta (\u03b2) Proteobacteria\nThe Betaproteobacteria consist of several groups of aerobic or facultative bacteria which are often highly versatile in their degradation capacities, but also contain chemolithotrophic genera (e.g., the ammonia-oxidizing genus Nitrosomonas) and some phototrophs (genera Rhodocyclus and Rubrivivax). Beta Proteobacteria play an important role in nitrogen fixation in various types of plants, oxidizing ammonium to produce nitrite- an important chemical for plant function. Many of them are found in environmental samples, such as waste water or soil. Pathogenic species within this class are the Neisseriaceae (gonorrhea and meningoencephalitis) and species of the genus Burkholderia.\nGamma (\u03b3) Proteobacteria\nThe Gammaproteobacteria comprise several medically and scientifically important groups of bacteria, such as the Enterobacteriaceae, Vibrion\u00adaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae. Many important pathogens belong to this class, e.g., Salmonella (enteritis and typhoid fever), Yersinia (plague), Vibrio (cholera), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (lung infections in hospitalized or cystic fibrosis patients), and E coli.\nDelta (\u03b4) Proteobacteria)\nThe Deltaproteobacteria comprise a group of predominantly aerobic genera, the fruiting-\u00adbody-forming myxobacteria, and a branch of strictly anaerobic genera, which contains most of the known sulfate-reducing bactria, (Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacter, Desulfococcus, Desulfonema, etc.) and sulfur-reducing bacteria (e.g., Desulfuromonas) alongside several other anaerobic bacteria with different physiology (e.g., ferric iron-reducing Geobacter and Pelobacter and Syntrophus species, which live symbiotically together).\nEpsilon (\u03b5) Proteobacteria\nThe Epsilonproteobacteria consist of only a few genera, mainly the curved to spiral-shaped Wolinella, Helicobacter, and Campylobacter. Most of the known species inhabit the digestive tract of animals and humans and serve as symbionts (Wolinella in cows) or pathogens (Helicobacter in the stomach and Campylobacter in the duodenum in humans). There have also been numerous environmental sequences of epsilons recovered from hydrothermal vent and cold seep habitats.\n",

Both types of \u00adpigments are similar and differ only in some side chains (see Fig. 4.12).\nSites for photosynthesis in green plants and bacteria\nIn higher plants, photosynthesis takes places in membraneous structures known as thylakoids which are located in organelles known as chloroplasts. In bacteria, the site for photosynthesis varies from one group of bacteria to the other. In the cyanobacteria, although chloroplasts are absent, photosynthesis occurs in thylakoid-like structures; in helicobacteria, it takes place on the cell membranes; in the purple bacteria, it takes place in invaginations of the cell membrane; in the green bacteria, it takes place on the cell membrane as well as in special \u00admembrane folding known as chlorosomes.\nOxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis\nIn higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria, the light energy excites the molecules of chlorophyll leading to release of energy which splits the water molecule and to the release of oxygen as a by-product, and finally the provision of H for fixing the CO2. In most bacteria (apart from cyanobacteria), oxygen is not released because water does not provide the H which converts the CO2 to carbohydrates. Rather, light energy excites bacteriochlorophyll leading to energy which splits H from H2S. In the dark, many photosynthetic bacteria can produce energy by the transfer of electron, or anaerobically.\n",

These cells contain bacteriochlorophyll \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d located on specialized membranes continuous with the cytoplasmic membrane. They are not able to use elemental sulfur as electron donor and typically use an organic electron donor, such as succinate or malate, but can also use hydrogen gas.\nChromatiaceae: These include purple sulfur bacteria, e.g., Chromatium. They are able to use sulfur and sulfide as the sole photosynthetic electron donor and sulfur can be oxidized to sulfate. They can use inorganic sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor. Purple sulfur bacteria must fix CO2 to survive, whereas non-sulfur purple bacteria can grow aerobically in the dark by respiration on an organic carbon source. They store elemental sulfur inside their cells, and these appear \u00adglobules within their cells, hence their name, purple sulfur bacteria.\nChlorobiaceae: These are green sulfur bacteria; their cells contain bacteriochlorophyll \u201cc\u201d or \u201cd\u201d located in chlorobium vesicles attached to the cytoplasmic membrane.\nHeliobacteria: The heliobacteria are anaerobic and phototrophic, converting light energy into chemical energy by photosynthesis using a PSI type reaction center (RC) (P798). The primary pigment involved is bacteriochlorophyll g, which is unique to the group and has a unique absorption spectrum. On account of this, the heliobacteria occupy their own special environmental niche. Phototrophy takes place on the cell membrane, which does not form folds or compartments as it does in purple phototrophic bacteria.Using 16 S RNA analysis, they are placed among the Firmicutes, Gram positive bacteria; although, they do not stain Gram positive, but they form heat resistant endospores. Heliobacteria are the only firmicutes known to conduct photosynthesis. They are photoheterotrophic, i.e., they require organic carbon sources. They do not fix carbon dioxide, they lack rubisco, and do not have Calvin cycle.They are found in soils, especially water logged soils such as in paddy fields. They are also strong nitrogen fixers.\n\nThe aerobic photosynthetic bacteria (APB )\nThe cyanobacteria are photosynthetic and aerobic, but recently another photosynthetic aerobic group was discovered. It was previously generally believed that anoxygenic photosynthesis was an anaerobic growth mode of either obligately anaerobic, or facultatively anaerobic bacteria capable of switching between respiration under aerobic conditions and phototrophy under anaerobic conditions. Recently (1979), the first reported member of the aerobic phototrophic bacteria, Erythrobacter longus, discovered in the Bay of Japan, changed our previous knowledge of the phototrophic bacteria. APBs have since been found in a wide variety of both marine and freshwater habitats, including acid mine drainage sites, soils, saline lakes, and soda lakes. (Rathgeber et al. 2004). Other genera of APBs found in freshwater and marine environments include the following: Erythrobacter,, Roseobacter,, Porphyro\u00adbacter,, Acidiphilium Erythromonas, Erythromi\u00adcrobium, Roseococcus, and Sandaracinobacter.\nThe distinguishing features of APBs are:\nThey produce their photosynthetic apparatus only in the presence of oxygen and the absence of light.The presence of bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) incorporated into light harvesting (LH) and reaction center (RC) complexes capable of transforming light into electrochemical energy under aerobic conditions.A relatively low amount of photosynthetic units per cell.Extreme inhibition of BChl synthesis by light.An abundance of carotenoid pigments.Apparent lack of intracytoplasmic photosynthetic membranes.The inability to grow phototrophically under anaerobic conditions.\nThe APBs produce a photosynthetic apparatus similar to that of purple phototrophic bacteria. However, this apparatus, in contrast to that of the anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria is produced only under aerobic conditions. In facultatively anaerobic organisms, the photosynthetic apparatus is synthesized under conditions of oxygen shortage and absence of light.They are a phylogenetically diverse group interspersed predominantly throughout the \u03b1-Proteobacteria, closely related to anoxygenic phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria as well as chemotrophic species. Recently, however, more and more APBs have been placed in the \u03b2-Proteobacteria.\n",

Cyanobacteria for example have special cells, heterocysts, where nitrogen fixation occurs and in which nitrogenase is protected because they contain only photosystem I whereas the other cells have both photosystem I and photosystem II (which generates oxygen when light energy is used to split water to supply H2 in photosynthesis.). For the same reason, also, Azotobacter and Rhizobium produce large amounts of extracellular polysaccharide, which helps limit the diffusion of oxygen to the cells. Furthermore, Rhizobium root nodules contain oxygen-scavenging molecules such as leghemoglobin, which regulate the supply of oxygen to the nodule tissues in the same way as hemoglobin regulates the supply of oxygen to \u00admammalian tissues.",

The nitrifying bacteria are so numerous in waters rich in ammonium such as sewage effluents that they readily convert the ammonium compounds therein into nitrates. The nitrates can accumulate in groundwater, and may ultimately enter drinking water. Regulations in many countries control the amount of nitrate in drinking water, because in the anaerobic conditions of the animal alimentary canal, nitrates can be reduced to highly reactive nitrites by microorganisms. Nitrites are absorbed from the gut and bind to hemoglobin, reducing its oxygen-carrying capacity. In young babies, this can lead to a respiratory illness known as blue baby syndrome.

A single organism from this domain is called an archaeon, just as a single member in the Domain Bacteria is a bacterium. As seen in Table 4.1 the properties of Archaea make them closer, evolutionarily, to Eukaryotes than they are to Bacteria. Thus their genetic transcription and translation do not show many typical bacterial features, and are in many aspects similar to those of eukaryotes. Many archaeal tRNA and rRNA genes harbor unique archaeal introns which are neither like eukaryotic introns, nor like bacterial introns. Several other characteristics also set the Archaea apart.\nWith the exception of one group of methanogens, Archaea lack a peptidoglycan wall. Even in this case, the peptidoglycan is very different from the type found in bacteria.Archaeans also have flagella that are notably different in composition and development from the superficially similar flagella of bacteria. Flagella from both domains consist of filaments extending outside of the cell, and rotate to propel the cell. Recent studies show that there are many detailed differences between the archaeal and bacterial flagella:\nBacterial flagella are motorized by a flow of H+ ions, wheras archaeal flagella move by the action of ATP.Bacterial cells often have many flagellar \u00adfilaments, each of which rotates independently; the archaeal flagellum is composed of a bundle of many filaments that rotate as a single assembly.Bacterial flagella grow by the addition of flagellin (the protein in the flagella) subunits at the tip; archaeal flagella grow by the addition of subunits to the base.Bacterial flagella are thicker than archaeal \u00adflagella, and have a hole through which flagellin flows to be added at the tip, whereas archeal flagella are too thin for such a hole.\n\n",

            "text": "Members of this group can be arranged as follows:\n\nExtremely halohilic Archaea: Members of this group survive in hypersaline environments, high levels of salt, such as are found in Great Salt Lake in Utah, and the Dead Sea. All are known as extremely Halophilic Archaea stain Gram negative. There are ten genera and 20 species of extreme halophiles, five of these genera contain only one species each: Halobacterium; Halobaculum; Natrosobacterium; Natrialba; Natrosomonas. The other genera are: Natrarococcus (two species); Haloarcula (two species); Halococcus (two species); Haloferax (four species); Halorubrum (five species). The key genera in this group are Halobacterium,, Haloferax, and Natronobacterium.\nMethane producing Archaea: Nearly half of the known species of Archaea are unique in being capable of producing methane energy from selected low molecular weight carbon compounds and hydrogen as part of their normal biochemical pathways. Methanogens are anaerobic and are the most common and widely dispersed of the Archaea being found in anoxic sediments and swamps, lakes, marshes, paddy fields, landfills, hydrothermal vents, and sewage works as well as in the rumen of cattle, sheep, and camels, the cecae of horses and rabbits, the large intestine of dogs and humans, and in the hindgut of insects such as termites and cockroaches.In their natural habitats, methanogens depend on substrate supply from associated anaerobic microbial communities or geological sources, and depending on the substrates they utilize, three types of methanogenic pathways are recognized (see Fig. 4.18):\n\nHydrogenotrophic methanogens which grow with hydrogen (H2) as the electron donor and carbon dioxide (CO2) as the electron acceptor. Some hydrogenotrophs also use formate, which is the source of both CO2 and H2.\nAcetoclastic methanogens which cleave acetate into a methyl and a carbonyl group. Oxidation of the carbonyl group into CO2 provides potential for reduction of the methyl group into CH4.\nMethylotrophic methanogens grow on methylated compounds such as methanol, methy\u00adlamines, and methyl sulfides, which act as both electron donor and acceptor or are reduced with H2.The important genera among methane producing Archaea are Methanobacterium, Methanosarcina and Methanocaldococcus. Methanogens utilize a wide variety of substrates for producing methane. These include CO2, alcohols, methyl substrates, methanol (CH3OH), methylamine (CH3NH3+), and trimethylamine ((CH3)3NH+) and acetic compounds such as acetate (CH3COO\u2212) and pyruvate.\n\nThermophilic and Extremely Acidophilic (Thermo\u00adplasmatales): This is a small group of extreme acidophilic organisms. They containing four species in two genera, they are unusual in their ability to tolerate acid conditions. The two Picrophilus species are the most acidophilic organisms known. They have an optimal pH requirement of 0.7, can still grow at a pH of \u22120.06 and die at pH values of less than 4.0. Both Picrophilus species were found in acid solfatoras in Japan. Solfatoras are craters, often near volcanoes, spewing out steam, and gases such as CO2, SO2, and HCl. When sulfurous gases are spewed out from such craters they are solfatoras (from the Italian for sulfur). The two species of Thermoplasma grow optimally at pH 2.0. Thermoplasma spp. are also very unusual in that they do not have a cell wall. T. volcanium has been isolated from a number of solfatoras around the world. The cell membrane of Thermoplasma is composed of a lipopolysaccharide-like compound consisting of lipid with mannose and glucose units and called a lipoglycan. Examples of this group are Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma. These Archae lack cellwalls and in this regard are like Mycoplasmas. They not only survive without \u00adcellwalls but they also survive high temperatures and low acid conditions. For these conditions, these organisms have special polysaccaride structures in their cell membranes, a lipopolyssacharide.\nHyperthermophilic Archae: Well-known members of this group are Thermococcus, Pyrococcus, and Methanopyrus. Members of this group have optimal temperatures of 80\u00b0C and many grow at temperatures higher than that of boiling water. Thus Thermococcus and Pyrococcus (cocci with a tuft of flagella on one side) grow at between 70\u00b0c and 106\u00b0C with an optimum at 100\u00b0C (Pyrococcus). Proteins, starch or maltose are oxidized as electron donors and S0 is the terminal acceptor and is reduced to H2S.\n",

As a rule, they grow best between 80\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C and several species will not grow below 80\u00b0C. Several species also prefer to live under very acidic conditions in dilute solutions of hot sulfuric acid. Approximately 15 genera are known, and most of the hyperthermophilic species have been isolated from marine or terrestrial volcanic environments, such as hot springs and shallow or deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Recent analyses of genetic sequences obtained directly from environmental samples, however, indicate the existence of low temperature Crenarchaeota, which have not yet been cultivated. The most spectacular feature of the Crenarchaeota, however, is their tolerance of, and even preference for, extremes of acidity and \u00adtemperature. While many prefer neutral to slightly acidic pH ranges, members of the Crenarchaeal order Sulfolobales flourish at pH 1\u20132 and die above pH 7. Optimum growth temperatures range from 75\u00b0C to 105\u00b0C and the maximum temperature of growth can be as high as 113\u00b0C (Pyrobolus). Most species are unable to grow below 70\u00b0C, although they can survive for long periods at lower temperatures. Crenarchaeota contains representations of organisms which live in a wide variety of environments including terrestrial environments (hot springs, geothermal power plants) or in marine (submarine hot vents, deep oil wells, marine smokers up to 400\u00b0C). Some exist in environments of over 100\u00b0C, while others live at ice cold conditions. For substrates, they utilize a wide range of gases: CO2, CO, CH4, S2O3, N2, NH4 (Fig. 4.19).\n\nHyperthermophiles in underwater volcanic envi\u00adronments\nTemperatures as high as 100\u00b0C occur around terrestrial volcanoes and Sulfolobus and Thermoproteus, both hyperthermophiles, have been isolated from such environments.\nHyperthermophiles in land volcanic environments\nArchae with the highest optimum temperature of growth known occur in underwater vents and near underwater volcanoes. Pyrodictium sp. and Pyrolobus sp. have optimum temperatures of growth of 100\u00b0C and 106\u00b0C respectively and are found in such environments. Desulforococcus (90\u00b0C, optimum) and Staphylothermus (95\u00b0C, optimum) are also found in that environment.\n",

The basis for this assumption is that Protozoa contain members which like plants are phototrophic, as well as members which like animals and fungi are heterotrophic. Furthermore Protozoa contain species with intermediate (mixotrophic) trophic \u00adcapabilities, i.e., they have the capability for both auto- and heterotrophic existence. Thus, many dinoflagellates are auxotrophic because they take up vitamins produced by other organisms; on the other hand, other Protozoa such as some euglenoids alter from one form of trophic existence system to another.",

            "text": "Protozoa are classified in many ways, primarily on morphological characteristics, and the one adopted here groups them into five: Mastigophora, Sarcodina, Ciliata, Sporozoa, and Suctoria.\n\nFlagellata (Mastigophora)These possess flagella and are subdivided into \u201cphytoflagellata\u201d and \u201czooflagellata,\u201d depending on whether they are plant-like (with chlorophyll) or animal-like (without chlorophyll). They usually multiply by longitudinal binary fission. Many \u00adflagellates are able to feed autotrophically as well as heterotrophically, and are important primary producers in lakes and oceans; yet, they can also feed like animals, ingesting or absorbing food synthesized by other organisms.Many are free-living, but some are parasitic. Examples of parasitic Mastigophora are Trypano\u00adsoma gambiense and T. rhodesiense which cause African sleeping sickness and is transmitted by \u00adtsetse flies. T. cruzi is the cause of Chagas\u2019 disease, prevalent in South and Central America, which affects the nervous system and heart; it is transmitted by the bite of assassin bugs. Giardiasis is caused by the mastigophoran Giardia lamblia.\n\nRhizopoda (Sarcodina)These Protozoa use pseudopodia (false feet) for locomotion and for catching preys. Members of the group Sarcodina move by pseudopodia; although, flagella may be present in the reproductive stages. Cytoplasmic streaming assists movement. Asexual reproduction occurs by fission of the cell.Sarcodina includes two marine groups known as foraminiferans and radiolarians. Both groups were present on earth when the oil fields were in formative stages, and marine geologists use them as potential markers for oil fields. Some amoebae live in shells from which the pseudopodia are extruded. Some members of the group such as Entamoeba histolytica, are pathogenic, causing amoebic dysentery in humans. This organism can cause painful lesions of the intestine and is contracted in polluted water (Fig. 4.21).\n\nCiliata\nCiliates possess cilia (short and highly coordinated flagellae), a somatic (macro) nucleus, and genetic (micro) nucleus, and a contractile vacuole is usually present. They move by means of cilia. Conjugation may be used for sexual reproduction and binary fission also occurs. The distinctive rows of cilia vibrate in synchrony and propel the organism in one direction. One of the best known members of the group is Paramecium; another of the free-living members of this group, is Tetrahymena.\nCiliates form an extremely large group are distinguished by the possession of cilia, two different types of nuclei and transverse fission of the organism when it divides, unlike flagellates and sarcodina which divide longitudinally.\nSporozoa\nMembers of the group Sporozoa form spores at one stage in their life cycle. Sporozoa are endoparasites which have spores. Most of them spend at least part of their life-cycle inside a host cell. Reproduction is a complex phenomenon in this group. Members of the group display no means of locomotion in the adult form. Their motile stages move by bending, creeping, and gliding and usually have an apical complex at their anterior end which help them penetrate their hosts. The group includes Plasmodium, the agent of malaria, Toxoplasma, the agent of toxoplasmosis, and Pneumocystis carinii, the cause of a serious pneumonia in AIDS patients.\nSuctoria\nThe juvenile forms are ciliated and motile, while the adult forms are sessile and capture food by tentacles. They feed by extracellular digestion and lack cilia in the adult phase. The adult have structures called haptocysts at the tip which attach to the prey. The prey\u2019s cytoplasm is then sucked directly into a food vacuole inside the cell, where its contents are digested and absorbed. Most suctoria are around 15\u201330 \u03bcm in size, with a non-contractile stalk and often a shell. Suctoria reproduce primarily by budding, producing swarmers which lack both tentacles and stalks but have cilia. Once the swarmers (motile young) have found a place to attach themselves, they quickly develop stalks and tentacles and lose their cilia. Because of the presence of cilia in the young of suctoria, some authors group the suctoria among ciliates.Suctoria are found in both freshwater and marine environments, and some which live on the surface of aquatic animals, and typically feed on ciliates. Some marine species form symbiotic relationships with crustaceans and even some fish. One species, Ephelota gemmipara lives on the external parasite of salmon, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (salmon louse).\n",

The principal diagnostic characteristics are shown in Fig. 4.22 and are as follows:\n\nSeptation of the hyphae\nThe septation, or lack thereof, of the hyphae is important in classifying fungi. Non-septate or coenocytic hyphae are found in Phycomycetes (Zygomycota). All other fungal groups have \u00adseptate hyphae. Examples of Phycomycetes are Mucor spp. and Rhizopus spp., the bread mold.\nThe nature of the asexual spores of aquatic Phyco\u00admycetes\nAquatic fungi are found among Phycomycetes. The asexual cells of many aquatic Phycomycetes are motile and are flagellated and help in the identification of the organisms (see Figs. 4.22 and 4.23). Many aquatic Phycomycetes, classified as Oomycetes, by some authors are pathogens of plants and fish. Phytphthora infestans which caused the famous potato blight and subsequent famine in Ireland which led to massive Irish immigration to the US belong to this group. Others are Plasmopara viticola (the cause of downy mildew of grapes), Plasmopara halstedii (sunflower downy mildew), and Saprolegniales spp., or water molds, which cause diseases of fish and other aquatic vertebrates. Some authors argue that the Oomycetes are so different from other fungi (so-called true fungi) that they should not be classified with them. The majority of authors classify them with the Phycomycetes, their peculiarities notwithstanding (see Table 4.8).\n\n\nThe presence of asci\nAn ascus or sac (plural, asci) which contains ascosposcores (sexual spores typically eight in number housed in an ascus) is diagnostic of Ascomycetes (Ascomycota). The trivial name of this group of fungi is sac fungi.\nThe presence of Basidiomycetes\nThe presence of basidiospores, typically four in number attached to a basidium, (a club-like structure) identifies Basidiomycetes. Some of the best known Basidiomycetes (Basidiomycota) are mushrooms. A microscopic examination of the \u201cgills\u201d on the underside of the mushrooms reveals the basidia carrying the basidiospores.\nDeutromycetes (Deuteromycota) or fungi imper\u00adfecti\nThese are fungi whose perfect or sexual stages have not been discovered. Some of the best examples are Penicillin spp. (with broom-like structures) and Aspergillus spp. (with club-like structures).\n",

All of the groups contain the following pigments which are soluble in organic solvents: Chlorophylls and several carotenoids, which include carotenes and xanthophylls. Chlorophylls \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb,\u201d alpha or beta carotene, and some xanthophylls are common. The water soluble phycobiliproteins (phycobilins) are found in blue-green algae, red algae, and a small group of flagellates.\nThe reserve compound\nReserve food material is usually stored within the cell and frequently within the plastid in which photosynthesis occurred. Starch, starchlike compounds, fats, or oils are the most common forms.\nThe nature of the zoospores\nSome organisms are motile during much of their lives, whereas other genera lack motility, or any motile reproductive stages. Adult algae are usually nonmotile; often, however, some reproductive stages (zoospores) are motile. The overall shape of the zoospores, the shape, number, and the insertion position of the flagella, and the presence or absence of hairs on the flagella are diagnostic (Fig. 4.24; Table 4.9).\n\nWall composition\nThe cell wall may be a simple outer covering around the protoplast or an elaborately ornamented structure. The materials found in algal walls are cellulose, xylans, mannans, sulfated polysaccharides, alginic acid, protein, silicon dioxide, and calcium carbonate\nGross morphology of the alga\nThe overall shape of the alga is diagnostic.\n",

A pure culture of the bacterium whose phages are to be isolated is introduced into sample of the water to be assessed for phage load, say about 1 ml of a log phase culture of the bacterium is added to about 10\u201315 ml of the water and incubated under conditions which will encourage the growth of the bacterium, including shaking if necessary. At the end of 18\u201324 h growth, a quantity of chloroform is added to kill the bacteria, and the broth is filtered in a 0.45 \u03bcm filter to remove the debris. The filtrate is then serially diluted and about 0.5\u20131 ml of the dilutions mixed with molten agar at 45\u00b0C and poured in to plates and incubated. It is assumed that each zone of clearing (plaque) on the bacterial lawn indicates one bacteriophage, or more correctly, one plaque forming unit (PFU), since as the case with bacteria, a clearing could be formed by a clump of bacteriophages. To ensure the avoidance of clumps, the counting or selection should done with as high a dilution as possible; the filtrate can also be shaken to breakup clumps before introduction into the agar.Some workers prefer to use the soft agar method. In this method, a small volume of a \u00addilution of phage suspension and a small quantity of host cells grown to high cell density, sufficient to give 107\u2013108 CFU/ml (colony forming units/ml), are mixed in about 2.5 ml of molten, \u201csoft\u201d agar at 46\u00b0C. The resulting suspension is then poured on to an appropriate basal agar medium. This poured mixture cools and forms a thin \u201ctop layer\u201d which hardens and immobilizes the bacteria.\nDirect plating out\nIf the aim is to assess the diversity of phages \u00adpresent in the water body, several dilutions of the water are made. At each dilution, pour plates are made as described above, each plate with one of the variety of bacteria whose phages are being sought in the water.\nDirect counting in a flow cytometer\n\n",

Because blue light penetrates water to a greater depth than light of longer wavelengths, these pigments allow red algae to photosynthesize and live at somewhat greater depths than most other algae. The picture of the red alga, Dichotomaria marginata, shown here was taken and kindly supplied by Keoki Stender, University of Hawaii. b) Sargassum fluitans. Sargassum seaweed, Gulf Weed (brown alga). This is a major component of the algae in the Sargasso Sea in the pelagic Atlantic. It has long, serrated fronds with a distinctive mid-rib, and smooth berry-like spherical gas-filled bladders, pneumatocysts, which assist the floatation of the alga.The photo of Sargassum above was kindly supplied by the South Carolia Department of Natural Resource, courtesy of H. Scott Meister. c) Synura spp, a member of the Chrysophyceae (golden or golden-brown algae on account of their content of fucoxanthin which in the presence of chlorophyll makes them look brown or golden brown), forms swimming colonies from a variable number of cells joined together at their posterior ends in a spherical or elongated cluster. Synura is important because it gives drinking water a bitter taste and a \u201cfishy\u201d cod liver oil type of odour. Synura is freshwater; some marine members such as Olisthodiscus luteus, produce neurotoxins which may kill aquatic fauna and may affect humans through eating shell fish raw.

Diatoms are microscopic algae which are easily recognizable because of their unique cell structure, silicified cell wall and life cycle. Diatoms are found anywhere there is water and light: in oceans, lakes and rivers; marshes, fens and bogs; damp moss and rock faces. They are an important part of the food chain in aquatic environments, especially in nutrient-rich areas of the world\u2019s oceans, where they occur in abundance.Photograph of diatoms kindly supplied by Dr David Carling) e) Dinoflagellates are minute marine unicellular algae with diverse morphology, the largest, Noctiluca, being as large as 2 mm in diameter!. Many are photosynthetic, while some are parasites of fish. In temperate climates they form blooms in summer months which may be golden or red. Their blooms produce neurotoxins marine animals eating and humans who consume them raw (such as shellfish)",
