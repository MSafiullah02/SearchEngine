In 2003, the SARS outbreaks in Vietnam and Guangzhou were brought under control earlier than in Hong Kong. The argument that Vietnam and Guangzhou controlled the outbreaks by better medical facilities and hygienic standards is unconvincing.6 Anecdotal reports suggest that changes in temperature may have been a contributing factor. The wider use of heaters in Toronto and air conditioning in Hong Kong and Singapore, usually to keep the room temperature within 18\u201322 \u00b0C, may have contributed to the long-lasting outbreak in these developed cities.6 There have been some studies reporting an association between the SARS outbreak and meteorological factors and air pollution.3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 However, these studies have largely been inconclusive. In fact, they use public data on SARS morbidity to obtain the daily reported number of probable SARS cases instead of the true daily onset number. Apparently, the results they obtained from the public data were doubtful due to time-delays and chaos in case reporting. In addition, as the designs in these studies focused on the relationship between the absolute daily number of SARS cases and meteorological factors, the results were greatly biased by the size of population in the affected areas. Therefore, no acceptable results up to now have been obtained concerning the association between the SARS outbreak and meteorological factors and air pollution.",

This was carried out using individual survey databases of probable SARS cases and close contacts, main transmission chains of SARS in important affected areas, and the medical records of SARS cases in some designated hospitals. The criteria for SARS diagnosis were consistent with the criteria from the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China for diagnosing infectious atypical pneumonia. The definition of SARS close contacts conformed to the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China criteria for determining close contacts of infectious atypical pneumonia. The histories of close contacts were confirmed by telephone interviews. All interviews were tape-recorded and checked by quality control staff to monitor the quality of the interview data. Of the 365 primary probable SARS cases, 15 cases (4.1%) were excluded from the present study due to unreliable information, and 350 cases (95.9%) and their 6727 close contacts during the periods of their clinical symptoms before admission were included.

In this study, as no active intervention measures against the primary cases such as case isolation were taken before admission, the variation of secondary attack rate before admission of the primary case may have resulted from impact of the meteorological factors and air pollution on the SARS outbreak.

On average, droplets are about 3 microns in diameter and, when inhaled, are capable of bypassing the protective mechanisms of the upper respiratory tract, causing infection. Droplets of 3 microns in size can stay in the air for 3 h.20 Wind is an important environmental parameter with respect to the suspending time of droplets in the air. In the outdoor environment, high wind velocity facilitates dilution and removal of the droplets and shortens their suspending time in the air, thus reducing the transmission potential. In the indoor environment, higher wind velocity usually means better ventilation for the same room. During the Toronto outbreaks of SARS, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in air samples that were obtained from the room occupied by a patient with SARS.21 The viral load of the room air could be affected by ventilation. When ventilation was good, the number of infected people became smaller, and the infection rate became lower.22 Our results are consistent with these findings. In this study, we found that higher DAWV corresponded to a lower secondary attack rate before admission of the primary case. All the findings suggest that ventilation may be an effective intervention measure on the prevention and control of a SARS outbreak.",

In this study, both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis showed that DARH was inversely associated with secondary attack rate. The results indicate that lower DARH corresponds to a higher secondary attack rate, which is consistent with our speculation. In addition, a high relative humidity level may shorten the suspending time of SARS-CoV in the air, as well as high wind velocity.

Firstly, the present study used an ecological study design and may therefore produce ecological fallacy. In addition, it is impossible for us to make an estimate of the direction and magnitude of possible bias because of a lack of more detailed data. Secondly, the results of this study may have been influenced by some social factors and other natural factors. Although we used secondary attack rate before admission of the primary case as a dependent variable to minimize the influence of social factors on the results, a confounding bias of the present study is possible due to a lack of data on the joint distribution between other potential confounding factors and the meteorological factors studied. Finally, we used data from 673 meteorological observation stations in this study in an attempt to best reflect the exposure level of the study areas. In the process of making use of these data, we assumed that the exposures of each affected area and the corresponding observation station were homogenous, which may lead to exposure misclassification to some extent.",
