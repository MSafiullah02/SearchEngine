            "text": "Aside from person-to-person close contact (less than six feet distance) and population mobility, environmental factors could influence droplet transmission and survival of viruses. Currently, subjects with COVID-19 are known as the main source of disease. Frequently, the transmission from person-to-person happens with close contact. The transmission initially occurs through the respiratory droplets formed when a patient sneezes, coughs, or even talks, just as in the spread of influenza and other respiratory viruses. Droplets can settle down in different parts of the body, such as the mouth, lungs, and eyes of subjects through inhaled air [3, 9]. This disease can also be transmitted by touching a surface or an object that has the virus on it [3, 10]. Moreover, transmission may occur through fomites in the environment around the COVID-19 patients. It has been reported that COVID-19 infection may lead to gastrointestinal infection and exist in stool. Hence, COVID-19 may also transmit via fecal-oral or body fluid routes. Consequently, coronavirus transmission can occur by direct route (close contact with COVID-19 patients) and indirect route (surfaces in the immediate environment or equipment used by COVID-19 patients) (Table 1 and 2\n). Usually, as with other types of respiratory pathogens, it is accepted that the most contagious time is when subjects are most symptomatic. However, asymptomatic infections can act as a source of the disease [10]. Cases that were infected from asymptomatic subjects in the prodrome phase of COVID-19 were also documented [10]. At present, based on limited findings, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from an infected pregnant mother to baby [11].",

The positive rate was relatively high for floor swab specimens (ICU: 70%; general COVID-19 ward: 15.4%), maybe due to air flow and gravity causing most virus droplets to float to the ground. Furthermore, as health workers walk around the ward, the virus can be transferred all over the floor, as shown by the 100% positive rate from the pharmacy floor, where there were no COVID-19 patients. Moreover, 50% of the specimens from the soles of the intensive care unit (ICU) staff shoes were positive. Hence, the soles of shoes might act as potential carriers.

Differences in sex hormones and immunity-linked genes on the X chromosome that affect both adaptive (acquired) and innate (non-specific) immune responses may describe the high vulnerability to COVID-19 infection in males.

Diarrhea was rarely documented in COVID-19 infection, while intestinal symptoms existed in approximately 20-25% of the subjects with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [3]. Some cases have complained of hemoptysis or headache while others were even relatively asymptomatic[13]. Co-morbidities such as underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes were reported in nearly half of the patients [3]. The symptoms of acute respiratory infection appeared within the early stage of disease.

Real-time PCR showing positive results for COVID-19. The confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia case should be hospitalized and isolated for therapy[2]. Based on the WHO recommendations for SARS and MERS, the NHC of China proposed criteria for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia [13]. A person with two clinical conditions and one contact history is regarded as a suspected patient. Without any clear contact history, suspected cases should have three clinical features [13]. The discharge criteria were: 1. afebrile for more than 3 days, 2. significant improvement of respiratory symptoms, and 3. improvement in the imaging abnormalities of the chest. The definitive etiology diagnosis of infection is needed, which can be made stronger by PCR assay using blood or lung specimen or by viral gene sequencing.

C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were increased in most patients, but procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations were normal[8]. Elevated serum ferritin levels reported in some patients[14]. All these alterations further explained that COVID-19 may exert a potential effect on lymphocytes, especially T cells. COVID-19 outbreaks and invades via lung mucosa stimulates inflammation cascades and motivates a cytokine storm, resulting in alteration in immune response such as peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes. Hence, intravenous immunoglobulin was applied in most subjects with reduced WBC and lymphocyte count[8]. Augmented serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels have also been documented and are associated with the severity of the disease. Nevertheless, elevated levels of interleukin-10, which is known as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, indicate a diverse pattern from that of SARS-CoV infection[14]. Some patients showed increased liver enzymes and glucose levels, and few patients exhibited abnormal muscle enzymes. Liver test abnormality of COVID-19 may not be induced by liver cell damage but by bile duct cell dysfunction and other reasons[8]. In summary, blood routine test, CRP, PCT, coagulation function, arterial blood gas, and tissue function tests (e.g. transaminases, bilirubin, myocardial enzyme, creatinine, urea nitrogen, urine volume, etc.) as tabulated in Table 3\nshould be monitored in patients [17]. Furthermore, subjects having upper respiratory tract symptoms and fever with leukopenia or lymphopenia should be suspected, particularly for cases with close contact or exposure history[18].",

Radiologists play the main role in the outbreak of COVID-19. Early diagnosis of the imaging abnormality could offer suspect pneumonia in cases at risk. Although the final detection of COVID-19 is based on RT-PCR, the findings of imaging are vital for pneumonia detection[16]. CT scans are proposed in cases with suspicious lung abnormalities. Appropriate recognition of COVID-19 pneumonia could provide quick management and follow-ups. Lung imaging shows the severity of COVID-19, therefore physicians should be informed about radiological reports. Clinical findings from COVID-19 cases with high abnormality shown in the CT scan who were admitted to the ICU [16] show that, on admission, these patients frequently showed subsegmental consolidation and bilateral multiple lobular, whereas CT reports from non-ICU patients showed subsegmental consolidation and bilateral ground-glass opacity (GGO) [15]. In severe infection, imaging can confirm heterogeneous consolidation with GGOs in bilateral lungs and bronchiectasis, indicating as \u201cwhite lung\u201d when most lobes of the lung are affected[19]. Furthermore, COVID-19 cases might show intralobular septal thickening and bilateral pleura along with little pleural effusion [13]. CT scanning enables recognition of the initial phase of respiratory infection and provides opportunity for a quick public health care response [20]. Slice chest CT has been shown as the main evidence for approved findings. Since chest radiography is not sensitive for the diagnosis of GGO and might show normal results in the initial stage of disease[20], it is not considered as the first-line imaging method for COVID-19. Nevertheless, bilateral multifocal consolidation can be observed in severe cases, partially fused into high consolidation with minor pleural effusions and even showing with \u201cwhite lung\u201d [13]. In this respect, the thin slice chest CT test is more useful for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia [18, 20]. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) can detect GGOs more easily in the early stage[4]. A study with a large sample size (3,665 confirmed cases of the disease) has reported that 95.5% of cases were detected as pneumonia. Pan et al. [2] conducted an experiment with 21 approved COVID-19 cases who underwent repeated CT with about 4-day intervals and observed negative results in four cases in the initial stages (0-4 days after onset of the early symptom), but repeated CT displayed abnormalities in the lung in all of these four patients.",

The previous experiment established the positive correlation of ACE2 expression and the infection of SARS-CoV in vitro [28].

            "text": "ACE2 is one of the components of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) which regulates blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and electrolyte balance. In the respiratory system, local lung RAS activation can influence the pathogenesis of lung damage through numerous mechanisms, including elevation of vascular permeability and changes in alveolar epithelial cells. In this cascade, renin increases angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I (Ang I, a decapeptide hormone)[29]. The ACE hydrolyzes Ang I to angiotensin II. The angiotensin II binds to its receptors and induces vasoactive effects. ACE2 catalyzes Ang I and Ang II to generate angiotensin-(1\u20139) and Ang-(1\u20137), respectively, and antagonizes several effects of Ang II. ACE2, by reducing local Ang II levels, acts as a counter-regulatory enzyme[29, 30]. ACE2 deficiency and the consequent high Ang II concentration, lead to increased vascular permeability, neutrophil accumulation, pulmonary oedema, disruption of gas exchange, and exacerbation in lung function. On the other hand, active recombinant ACE2 protein alleviates ALI symptoms in ACE2 knockout animals[31]. In the lungs, RAS activity is basically high, and the activity of the ACE2 is also highly increased to control the balance of Ang II/Ang-(1\u20137) concentration[29, 30]. It has been shown that ACE2 participates in the severe ALI and failure that is induced by SARS, influenza A H5N1 virus, acid aspiration, sepsis, and lethal avian. Currently, ACE2 is proposed as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ALI in humans [32].",

These findings suggest that the SARS-CoV interrupts the physiological balance between ACE/ACE2 and Ang II/Ang-(1\u20137)[29].

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has separated job tasks into four risk exposure levels, as presented in Figure 4\n. Since Covid-19 spreads quickly through respiratory droplets, head and neck surgeons who have close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract are principally at high risk. Given the high number of surgeries done worldwide, it is essential for the surgeons and surgical team to be adequately protected from coronavirus transmission. In the COVID\u201319 patients who need surgery, risks versus benefits of the procedure for the patient should be cautiously evaluated. The surgeon may temporarily postpone an emergency or urgent surgery on cases which show coronavirus symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, fever). For all suspected cases that are undergoing operation, chest CT and blood tests need to be checked before admission. The surgical team can also order an in-house RT-PCR assay within 24h. If the subject's condition does not allow for a 24h wait, the patient is assumed to be COVID-19-positive. For suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, non-operative management is preferred. If surgery is essential in these subjects, suitable personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used (Fig. 5\n). Furthermore they should remove their PPE and place the PPE in a labelled waste bag in an anteroom. There are various levels of emergency related to COVID-19 patient needs, and assessment is required to distinguish between them. Table 6\nsummarizes the key recommendations for the surgeon and surgical team in different stages [[33], [34], [35]].",

            "text": "Currently, there is no effective medicine for the treatment for COVID-19 patients, which can, in some patients, lead to lethal lung failure. Furthermore, there is no specific antiviral medicine or vaccine for this virus[8]. Pathogenesis of coronavirus is an extremely complex process, and much of the required details of host-pathogen interaction remain unknown. Discovering the useful medicine options for the treatment of the COVID-19 outbreak is vital [36, 37] (Table 7\n). There are various possible treatment approaches [29] including: (i) raising of ACE2 expression by injection of soluble recombinant ACE2 protein or using therapeutic vectors expressing high levels of ACE2 which may be applicable in the future[38], (ii) using specific ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril, and (iii) inhibiting Ang II receptors. In particular, the type I Ang II receptor has been reported to promote disease by motivating edemas and disturbing lung function[38]. Hence, a type I Ang II receptor blocker (e.g., losartan) has been successively examined for improving COVID-19 pneumonia[29]. Treatment with a soluble form of ACE2 probably acts as a competitive interceptor of coronavirus by inhibiting binding of the viral particle to the ACE2 receptor, which can consequently slow coronavirus entry into the cells and protect against lung injury. Remdesivir (adenosine analogue), which is used for the treatment of the Ebola disease, is incorporated in the nascent chains of viral RNA, causing premature termination. This drug is currently used for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Randomized trial studies have reported the safety and efficacy of interferon-\u03b1 (5 million U per time, twice a day) and lopinavir-ritonavir (two capsules each time, twice a day) in COVID-19 patients [39]. Wang et al. determined the efficacy of some FDA-approved drugs such as penciclovir, ribavirin, nitazoxanide, chloroquine, nafamostat, and favipiravir (T-705) for treatment of COVID-19 infection in vitro[40]. They found that chloroquine and remdesivir are potentially effective for the control of COVID-19 infection in vitro [40]. Chloroquine is a well-known drug that has currently been documented as a strong broad-spectrum antiviral agent for the treatment of malarial and autoimmune disease. This drug interferes with glycosylation of the cellular receptor, elevates endosomal pH needed for virus/cell fusion, and consequently reduces virus infection[41]. The use of traditional medicine to recover the physical signs of cases has also been recommended by some Chinese researchers[8]. Luo et al. showed that some Chinese medicines such as Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao), and Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu) are useful in the prevention of COVID-19 [42]. Some other herbal plants, through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity might be considered as useful agents in the treatment of COVID-19 infection [[43], [44], [45], [46]]. Furthermore, zinc nanoparticles, due to their potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory [47], and antiviral effects, have been found to inhibit influenza viral load and COVID-19 replication in an in vitro experiment [48].",
