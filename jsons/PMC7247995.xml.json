To address this issue, we administered a measure of emotional problems to large online sample of adult participants. In particular, we administered the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Emotional Problems scale because it assesses anxiety, somatic complains, fear, and depressive features. Interestingly, the Emotional Problems Scale total score yields a well-characterized cut off score to identify people with clinically relevant emotional problems (Findon et al., 2016; Goodman, 1997). Identifying people with clinically relevant distress may be useful in treatment planning. We relied on the emotional problem construct because reactions to quarantine may include a range of negative emotions rather than have a single, specific form. Moreover, participants were administered also self-report measures of DSM-5 Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) domains and COVID-19 related causal beliefs, respectively.",

In line with previous studies (e.g., Findon et al., 2016), it has been adapted for use in adults with minor alteration of some items. For the purpose of the present study, we administered the Emotional Problems scale of the SDQ in order to assess common areas of emotional and behavioral difficulties. In the full sample (N = 1043), the one-factor model of the five Emotional Problems Scale items showed adequate fit in weighted least square mean and variance adjusted confirmatory factor analysis, \u03c7\n2 (5) = 19.91, p < .01, root mean square error of approximation =0.053, 95% confidence interval = 0.030, 0.079, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.98, comparative fit index = 0.99, standardized root mean square residual = 0.02. In our study, the mean comparison curve fit index value (Ruscio, Carney, Dever, Pliskin, & Wang, 2018), averaged across mean-above-minus-mean-below-a-cut (MAMBAC), maximum eigenvalue analysis (MAXEIG), and latent-mode (L-mode) analysis analyses, was 0.37, suggesting that the latent structure of the five Emotional Problems Scale items was dimensional in nature (Ruscio et al., 2018). In our study, we relied on the published cut-off value (i.e., SDQ EP \u22657; Goodman, 1997; Findon et al., 2016) for the SDQ Emotional Problems (EP) in order to identify participants who were perceiving themselves as experiencing clinically relevant emotional problems. Indeed, clinically relevant cut-off scores may be useful for clinical decision making when adopting an empirically based dimensional approach (e.g., Widiger & Simonsen, 2005).",

It was developed relying on independent online searches; firstly, possible origin theories for the virus were identified; then, these theories were assigned to one of the following theme: (a) supernatural beliefs; (b) conspiracy beliefs; and (c) scientifically supported beliefs. Accordingly, 16 items listing causal beliefs for the COVID-19 were selected. Each COVID-19 CBQ item was measured on a 0 (Never) to 10 (Always) scale. COVID-19 CBQ item scores are summed to yield three scales, namely, the Supernatural Belief Scale (5 items), Conspiracy Belief Scale (9 items), and the Scientifically Supported Belief Scale (2 items). In a previous study on Italian community-dwelling adults (Somma et al., 2020), full-information confirmatory factor analysis findings suggested the adequacy of a three-factor model for the COVID-19 CBQ items (comparative fit index = 0.96). In the full sample, item response theory-based reliability coefficient values (Sharp, Steinberg, Temple, & Newlin, 2014), were 0.95, 0.98, and 0.78 for the Supernatural Belief, Conspiracy Belief, and Scientifically Supported Belief Scales, respectively.",

Although we relied on a validated empirical cut-off (e.g., Findon et al., 2016) to assign participants to the emotional problem group, this method choice was not meant to suggest that emotional problems have a latent categorical structure. Actually, the results of taxometric analyses clearly showed the dimensional nature of emotional problems. Our decision was indeed related to the fact that in applied settings (e.g., clinical assessment), it may be important to identify participants with clinically relevant problems for treatment planning. Moreover, we decided to rely on the Emotional Problem Scale because it has no item content overlap with the PID-5-SF. Of course, it should be observed that relying on different measures to assess the same constructs may lead to different findings. Further studies including an extended set of sources of information/demographic variable, and a fine-grained assessment of their use should be carried out before accepting our conclusions.",
