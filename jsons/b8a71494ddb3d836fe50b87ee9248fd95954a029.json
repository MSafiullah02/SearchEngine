            "text": "The name Staphylococcus (staphyle, bunch of grapes) was introduced by Ogston (1883) for the group micrococci causing inflammation and suppuration. He was the first to differentiate two kinds of pyogenic cocci: one arranged in groups or masses was called \"Staphylococcus\" and another arranged in chains was named \"Billroth's Streptococcus.\" A formal description of the genus Staphylococcus was provided by Rosenbach (1884) . He divided the genus into the two species Staphylococcus aureus and S. albus. Zopf (1885) placed the mass-forming staphylococci and tetrad-forming micrococci in the genus Micrococcus. In 1886, the genus Staphylococcus was separated from Micrococcus by Fl\u00fcgge (1886). He differentiated the two genera mainly on the basis of their action on gelatin and on relation to their hosts. Staphylococci liquefied gelatin and were parasitic or pathogenic or both whereas micrococci were variable in their action on gelatin and were saprophytic. The genera Staphylococcus, Micrococcus and Planococcus, containing Gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci, were later placed in the family Micrococcaceae. Evans et al. (1955) proposed separating staphylococci from micrococci on the basis of their relation to oxygen. The facultative anaerobic cocci were placed in the genus Staphylococcus and the obligate aerobic cocci in the genus Micrococcus. By the mid-1960s, a clear distinction could be made between staphylococci and micrococci on the basis of their DNA base composition (Silvestri and Hill, 1965) . Members of the genus Staphylococcus have a DNA G+C content of 33-40 mol%, whereas members of the genus Micrococcus have a high G+C content of around 70 mol%. Further studies have shown that staphylococci can be distinguished from micrococci and other catalase-positive cocci on the basis of their cell wall composition (Schleifer and Kandler, 1972; Endl et al., 1983) , cytochrome profile (Faller et al., 1980) and menaquinone pattern (Collins and Jones, 1981) , susceptibility to lysostaphin and erythromycin , bacitracin (Falk and Guering, 1983) , and fura-zolidone (Baker, 1984) . Comparative immunochemical studies of catalases (Schleifer, 1986) , DNA-DNA hybridization studies, DNA-rRNA hybridization studies (Schleifer et al., 1979; Kilpper et al., 1980) , and comparative oligonucleotide cataloguing of 16S rRNA (Ludwig et al., 1981) clearly demonstrated the epigenetic and genetic difference of staphylococci and micrococci. Members of the genus Staphylococcus form a coherent and well-defined group of related species that is widely divergent from those of the genus Micrococcus. Until the early 1970s, the genus Staphylococcus consisted of three species: the coagulase-positive species S. aureus and the coagulase-negative species S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus, but a deeper look into the chemotaxonomic and genotypic properties of staphylococci led to the description of many new staphylococcal species. Currently, 36 species and several subspecies are recognized in the genus Staphylococcus (Table 1) .",

            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus has been confirmed to be the causative agent of many cases of severe food poisoning; therefore, its presence in foods is of major concern. Staphylococcus aureus is very susceptible to heat treatment and most sanitiz- ing agents. Hence, when it or its enterotoxins are found in processed foods, poor sanitation is usually indicated. Detailed procedures for preparing food samples for analysis, isolating and enumerating S. aureus, and detecting staphylococcal enterotoxins in foods can be found in the following texts: Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods (Downes and Ito, 2001) , Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International (Horowitz, 2000) , and Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM; United States Food and Drug Administration, 1995) . In addition to the AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) approved microslide test method (Horowitz, 2000) , it is possible to detect enterotoxins directly in culture and in contaminated foods by the following rapid methods: radioimmunoassay (RIA) (Miller et al., 1978) , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and reverse passive latex agglutination (RPLA). An ELISA kit, available from Tecra Diagnostics (Roseville, Australia), is distributed by International Bioproducts, Inc. (Redmond, WA, USA) , and an RPLA is available from Oxoid (Columbia, MD, USA). Molecular methods are being investigated for their usefulness in detecting staphylococcal enterotoxin. For example, Western immunoblotting has been used to detect staphylococcal enterotoxin A (Rasooly and Rasooly, 1998) . In this procedure, the staphylococcal enterotoxin A (native or heat-denatured) is separated by size using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a membrane and then the membrane is probed with antibodies. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an additional molecular method being studied for its ability to detect S. aureus and staphylococcal enterotoxins from food samples (McLauchlin et al., 2000; Atanassova et al., 2001; Tamarapu et al., 2001) . One potential problem for PCR is the possibility of false-negative reactions due to PCR inhibitors that might be present in some foods.",

Incubate at 35-37\u00b0C and examine periodically during a 6-h interval for clot formation. Any degree of clot formation is considered a positive reaction. Small or poorly organized clots may be observed by gently tipping tube so that liquid portion of reaction mixture approaches lip of tube; clots will protrude above liquid surface. Coagulase-positive cultures are considered to be S. aureus. Test positive and negative controls simultaneously with cultures of unknown coagulase reactivity.

This procedure is recommended by the AOAC for the identification of S. aureus isolated from foods. With this procedure, false-positive tests may occur with mixed cultures, but this will probably be avoided if only well-isolated colonies typical of S. aureus are chosen. On rare occasions, coagulase-negative mutants of S. aureus may be present in foods and overlooked by the above procedures, and the presence of other coagulase-positive staphylococci, such as S. intermedius and certain strains of S. hyicus, may be misrepresented as S. aureus using the coagulase test alone.",

Aseptically, spread the inoculum over the surface of the agar. Avoid the extreme edges of the plate. Maintain the plates in an upright position until the inoculum is adsorbed by the medium (about 10 min on properly dried plates). If the inoculum is not readily adsorbed, plates may be placed in an incubator in an upright position for about 1 h before inverting. Invert plates and incubate 45-48 h at 35-37\u00b0C. Select plates containing 20-200 colonies unless plates at only lower dilutions (> 200 colonies) have colonies with the typical appearance of S. aureus. If several types of colonies appear to be S. aureus, count the number of colonies of each type and record counts separately. When plates at the lowest dilution plated contain < 20 colonies, they may be used. If plates containing > 200 colonies have colonies with the typical appearance of S. aureus and typical colonies do not appear on plates at higher dilutions, use these plates for enumeration of S. aureus, but do not count nontypical colonies. Select one or more colonies of each type counted and test for coagulase production. Coagulase-positive cultures may be considered to be S. aureus. Add the number of colonies on triplicate plates represented by colonies giving a positive coagulase test, and multiply the total by the same dilution factor. Report this number as S. aureus per gram of product tested. The sensitivity of this procedure may be increased by using larger volumes (> 1 ml) distributed over > 3 replicate plates. Plating of two or more decimal dilutions may be required to obtain plates with the desired number of colonies per plate.",

On blood agar, abundant growth of most staphylococcal species occurs within 18-24 h. Since most species cannot be distinguished from one another during this time period, colonies should be picked at this time only for preliminary identification testing (e.g., when specimens are taken from patients with acute infections). Colonies should be allowed to grow for at least an additional two to three days before the primary isolation plate is confirmed for species or strain composition Kloos and Schleifer, 1975c) . This growth period is particularly important when the sampling of more than one colony is needed to obtain sufficient inocula for determining the predominant organism or to obtain a pure culture. Failure to hold plates for 72 h, can result in 1) selection of more than one species or strain if sampling yields an inoculum of two or more colonies, 2) selection of an organism(s) not producing the infection, if the specimen contains two or more different species or strains, and 3) incorrectly labeling a mixed culture as a pure culture. Colonies should be Gram-stained, subcultured, and tested for genus, species, and strain properties. It should be noted that most staphylococci of major medical interest produce growth in the upper as well as the lower anaerobic portions of thioglycolate broth or semisolid agar .",

Also for acute sepsis, 2 or 3 sets should be collected from separate sites all within 10 min; for acute endocarditis, 3 sets should be collected from separate sites within 1-2 h; and for subacute endocarditis, 3 sets should be collected from separate sites taken 15 min apart. Initial processing of a blood specimen depends on the culture system used. All bacterial blood cultures should be incubated at 35\u00b0C for up to 7 days for evidence of growth.

Acceptable methods for urine collection include midstream clean catch, catheterization, and suprapubic aspiration. At least 1 ml of midstream urine should be collected in a sterile, wide-mouth container. Unpreserved specimens should be cultured within 2 h of collection or stored in a refrigerator for no more than 24 h. Most references to diagnostic criteria state that a significant bacteriuria occurs when there are 100,000 cells or more per ml in a clean-voided, midstream specimen obtained from asymptomatic patients. With acute dysuria and frequency in young, sexually active females, a colony count as low as 100 per ml may be a useful criterion. Many significant urinary tract infections due to S. saprophyticus are associated with only 100 to 10,000 colonies per ml. If significant, these low counts may be substantiated by repetition of the procedure. Significant bacteriuria may also be determined by microscopic examination of a Gram-stained smear of uncentrifuged urine. The presence of at least two bacteria per 1000-X microscopic field of the Gram-stained smear is approximately equal to 100,000 or more cells per ml (Pollock, 1983) .",

Washing or swabbing methods disperse cutaneous bacteria to provide samples of uniform composition. They break up large aggregates or microcolonies on skin into smaller colony-forming units (CFU) and in some cases single cells. Impression methods estimate the number of microcolonies or aggregates of bacteria on the skin surface. Biopsy methods can determine the location of bacteria in microniches on skin. Most of the sampling of aerobic bacteria on skin and mucous membranes has been performed using scrubbing and swabbing methods. The swab technique described by Kloos and Musselwhite (1975a) is suitable for use with human as well as other mammalian skin. The medium most widely used for the isolation and culture of natural populations of staphylococci is P agar (Kloos et al., 1974 From each inoculated swab, a series of dilutions are prepared and plated on standard size (15 \u00d7 100 mm) P agar plates, in an attempt to obtain 50-300 isolated colonies on a plate for identification and enumeration. Inoculated plates are incubated at 34-35\u00b0C for 3-4 days and then held at room temperature for an additional 2 days. Each colony type is enumerated and one or two representatives of each type per plate are examined further for distinguishing genus, species, and strain characteristics. Colony morphology can be a useful supplementary character in the identification of species and strains. Selective media may be used in addition to the nonselective P agar if bacterial and/or fungal populations are very large (e.g., from the human inguinal and perineal area or from the skin of certain animals) and/or if the cutaneous flora contains species producing large, spreading colonies. Pigment production of colonies may be enhanced by the addition of milk, fat, glycerol monoacetate, or soaps to P agar or heart infusion agar (Willis et al., 1966) .",

Staphylococcus sciuri, S. lentus, S fleuretti and S. vitulus may have an L-alanine instead of a glycine residue bound to lysine of the peptide subunit (peptidoglycan type: Lys-Ala-Gly 4 ). The peptidoglycan types for macrococci can be either Lys-Gly 3-4 , L-Ser (M. caseolyticus, M. equipercicus and M. carouselicus) or Lys-Gly 3 , L-Ser (M. bovicus).",

The teichoic acids consist of polymerized polyol phosphates that are substituted with various combinations of sugars and/or N-acetylamino sugar residues, and also esterlinked D-alanine residues. In some cases, Nacetylamino sugar residues can also form an integral part of the polymer chain (Endl et al., 1983; Endl et al., 1984) . The occurrence of the same major components does not always mean that the structure of teichoic acid is identical; for example, the teichoic acids of S. capitis and S. hyicus show a similar composition but their structures are quite different.",

DNA similarity (> 70%) is the criterion that has been used to determine species boundaries in the formal classification of staphylococcal species and most subspecies. Selected phenotypic characters are also useful in classification because they had a high predictive value in identifying DNA similarity groups. Recently, recommended minimal standards for the description of new staphylococcal species have been published (Freney et al., 1988) . Characters studied at the cellular and population levels, including morphological and physiological properties, enzyme reactions, and intrinsic resistance to certain antibiotics, have been included in practical identification schemes as shown in Tables 2-5.

Interestingly, the activity of these regulators is controlled by PTS-mediated phosphorylation. A putative transcriptional terminator partially overlapping an inverted repeat, which could be the target site for the antiterminator protein GlcT, is found in the glcT-glcA intergenic region. This organization resembles the glcT-ptsG region of B. subtilis, encoding the GlcT antiterminator protein and the glucose-specific enzyme II, respectively (St\u00fclke and Hillen, 1999) . Therefore, glcA expression in S. carnosus is most likely controlled by antitermination.

The situation is better with S. xylosus, in which sugar transport and its regulation has been investigated by the group of R. Br\u00fcckner (T\u00fcbingen). In S. xylosus, GlcU and GlkA constitute a glucose utilization system enabling glucose to be catabolized independently from the PTS. Glucose is transported through the cell membrane via GlcU in a nonphosphorylated form and is subsequently phosphorylated by GlkA. This PTS-independent system substantially contributes to glucose catabolism in S. xylosus. The novel, non-PTS glucose uptake gene glcU and the downstream gene gdh, which encodes glucose dehydrogenase, are found in a bicistronic operon (Fiegler et al., 1999) . A similar organization has also been found in B. subtilis. The glucose kinase gene, glkA, is not part of the operon in S. xylosus (Wagner et al., 1995) . The glcU and glkA genes were first detected by using Tn917 insertions that resulted in a defect in glucosespecific catabolite repression of the lactose operon. Several other catabolic operons are also affected, which suggests the involvement of GlcU and GlkA in catabolite repression. There is evidence that the GlcU permease is functional at high extracellular glucose concentrations; the highly efficient glucose-specific PTS recognizes and transports glucose preferentially at low external glucose concentrations. The mechanism by which GlcU allows glucose to enter the cells remains to be elucidated. In the genome sequence of S. aureus, homologs of glcU and glkA are present, which strongly suggests that also in this and perhaps other staphylococcal species, glucose is taken up by both PTSdependent and PTS-independent mechanisms.",

The cloned lactose operon ( Fig. 4 ) of S. aureus contains not only the phospho-\u03b2galactosidase gene and genes involved in lactose uptake, but also the genes of the tagatose-6-P pathway (Breidt et al., 1987; Oskouian and Stewart, 1987) . The corresponding genes are arranged in a heptacistronic operon (lacABCD-FEG). The locus was originally defined by mutations abolishing lactose utilization. The genes lacFE code for the galactoside-specific PTS permease, enzyme IIA, and enzyme IICB (Breidt and Stewart, 1986) . The last gene, lacG, encodes the phospho-\u03b2-galactosidase. The lacABCD genes specify the enzymes of the tagatose-6-P pathway, with lacAB coding for galactose-6-P isomerase, lacC for tagatose-6-P kinase, and lacD for tagatose-1,6-diP aldolase (Rosey et al., 1991) . The gene encoding the lactose operon repressor, lacR, is upstream of the lacABCD-FEG operon (Oskouian and Stewart, 1990a; Oskouian et al., 1990b) . Utilization of lactose and galactose in S. aureus relies on the PTSdependent uptake and phosphorylation of the sugars, resulting in lactose 6-P and galactose 6-P, respectively. Glucose and galactose 6-P are produced from intracellular lactose 6-P by a phospho-\u03b2-galactosidase (Hengstenberg et al., 1993) . Glucose is metabolized via the FBP pathway, whereas galactose 6-P is degraded via the tagatose-6-P pathway. Supplementation of the growth medium with lactose or galactose results in the induction of the lac genes, with galactose 6-P being the intracellular inducer. Apart from this sugar-specific regulation, the lactose operon of S. aureus is also subject to global carbon catabolite repression, but the nature of the regulatory mechanism remains unclear (Oskouian and Stewart, 1990a) . It is conceivable that part of the described catabolite repression of the lac operon of S. aureus is actually caused by glucose-mediated inducer exclusion (Reizer et al., 1989; Saier et al., 1996) .",

Therefore, both staphylococcal species probably use this enzyme to cleave maltose. However, the mechanism of maltose transport remains to be elucidated. In any case, at least one glucose moiety has to be phosphorylated by the glucose kinase for complete maltose catabolism. The mannitol phosphotransferase system of S. carnosus has been described. The system consists of an EIICB enzyme (encoded by mtlA) and of EIIA (encoded by mtlF), which together form the mannitol-specific PTS permease. The mtlA and mtlF genes are clustered on the S. carnosus chromosome with mtlD, the gene for mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, which produces fructose 6-P. The gene mtlA is about 2 kb away from mtlF and mtlD (Fischer et al., 1989; Fischer and Hengstenberg, 1992) . The nucleotide sequence of this intervening region has not been determined. Staphylococcus aureus possesses an EIIA protein specific for mannitol with the same apparent molecular mass as the S. carnosus enzyme and virtually identical amino acid sequence at the amino terminus and around the phosphorylation site (Reiche et al., 1988) .

Citrate synthases of staphylococci are not affected by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), but are severely inhibited by ATP (Hoo et al., 1971) . In the presence of glucose, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase of S. aureus has considerable activity during aerobic growth; although its activity is about tenfold less than that under anoxic conditions. It is therefore not surprising that in the presence of glucose, some lactic acid is produced even under oxic conditions (Garrard and Lascelles, 1968) . During aerobic growth in the absence of glucose, an oxidation of acetate, succinate and malate by resting S. aureus cell suspensions has been observed manometrically (Collins and Lascelles, 1962; Strasters and Winkler, 1963) . However, when glucose or galactose (0.04 M) is present in the growth medium, the oxidation of these substrates is abolished. Growth in the presence of glucose also results in a 40-fold decrease in the cytochrome content (Strasters and Winkler, 1963) . The presence of a pyruvate dismutation system in staphylococci was first described by Krebs (1937) . Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity has been demonstrated in S. aureus and S. epidermidis (Sivakanesan and Dawes, 1980) .",

There are two forms of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase which can be differentiated by their catalytic and structural properties. Class I aldolases function via the formation of a Schiff base intermediate between the substrate and a lysine amino group of the enzyme. Class II aldolases do not form a Schiff base intermediate, but contain an essential divalent cation, such as Zn +2 , Ca +2 or Fe +2 , and can be inhibited by EDTA. Since class I aldolases are typical for higher animals and plants and are only found in a few bacteria, it is surprising that nearly all staphylococcal species studied so far possess a class I aldolase . The only exceptions are S. intermedius and S. hyicus, which possess both classes of aldolases, and S. caseolyticus (reclassified as Macrococcus caseolyticus), which possesses only a class II aldolase . The 33-kDa class I aldolase of S. aureus strain ATCC 12600 has been purified; it appears to be active as a monomer . Later, the S. carnosus TM300 fda gene, encoding the glycolytic fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (Fda), was cloned in E. coli. The 296-amino-acid protein has a M r of 32,855. The S. carnosus FDA is also a class I aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), which does not need divalent metal ions for catalytic activity. Cloning of fda back into S. carnosus led to a sixfold increase of aldolase production and activity. Glucose in the growth medium has a stimulating effect on aldolase production or activity (Witke and G\u00f6tz, 1993) .",

Numerous publications on S. aureus describe the influence of glucose on a variety of cellular processes, such as utilization of alternative carbon sources, production of extracellular enzymes, activity of glycolytic enzymes, and cytochrome content. Especially the production of potential virulence factors has attracted considerable attention. However, the mechanism by which glucose exerts its regulatory effect has not been elucidated. The analysis of catabolite repression of inducible systems is quite often complicated by the inability of the inducer to enter the cells in appreciable amounts, when glucose is also present in the medium. In addition to this process, referred to as \"inducer exclusion/inducer expulsion,\" the rapid removal of internalized inducer, has been described for a number of Gram-positive bacteria (Saier et al., 1996) . While inducer exclusion is found in a wide variety of bacteria, inducer expulsion is encountered less frequently. The latter does not appear to operate in S. aureus. The molecular mechanisms leading to inducer exclusion in Gram-positive bacteria are not yet completely understood.",

CcpA-dependent carbon catabolite repression has been analyzed in some detail in S. xylosus (Egeter and Br\u00fcckner, 1996) . Inactivation of the ccpA gene by insertion of a resistance cassette leads to a pleiotropic loss of transcriptional regulation at several promoters, including the ccpA promoters. This autoregulation of ccpA apparently reflects the need of S. xylosus to balance regulation by CcpA carefully. CcpA shows a relatively weak affinity for its cognate operator sites, termed \"catabolite responsive elements\" (cre; Hueck et al., 1994) , and must, therefore, be activated to bind efficiently to cre. The signal enabling CcpA to bind to DNA is a phosphorylated form of HPr, the phosphocarrier protein of the PTS, which is produced by the HPr kinase (HPrK; Huynh et al., 2000) . HPr is phosphorylated at Ser-46 in an ATPdependent manner and can also be dephosphorylated by the same enzyme. Thus, HPrK constitutes a bifunctional HPr kinase/phosphatase. HPr as well as HPr kinase are absolutely required for CcpA activity in S. xylosus (Jankovic and Br\u00fcckner, 2002) . The genetic organization around the hprK gene of S. xylosus is identical to that in S. epidermidis and S. aureus (Huynh et al., 2000) .",

The S. aureus genome contains also a typical pyruvate carboxylase gene that is necessary for initiation of the TCA cycle ( Table 6 ). The activity of this enzyme has been verified. Fig. 5 . Summary of the current knowledge on CcpA-dependent catabolite repression in staphylococci and other Grampositive bacteria with low G+C content. When provided with a rapidly metabolizable phosphotransferase system (PTS) sugar (e.g., glucose), bacteria transport it via the PTS. During the process of sugar transport, the phosphoryl group is transferred to the entering sugar, and the PTS proteins are predominantly left in a non-phosphorylated form. Heat-stable phosphocarrier (HPr) kinase senses the presence of glucose in the cell, most probably via intermediates of glycolysis, and phosphorylates non-phosphorylated HPr at Ser-46 in an ATP-dependent manner. By interacting with the central regulator CcpA, P-Ser-46-HPr increases its affinity for cre operators. The complex CcpA/HPr-Ser46-P/cre blocks or activates the transcription of different operons. In the absence of glucose, the activity of HPrK shifts towards P-Ser-HPr phosphatase. Since there is no available sugar and thus no phosphoryl group transfer by the PTS, the HPr protein remains phosphorylated at His-15. Without P-Ser-46-HPr as a co-effector, CcpA shows very low affinity for binding to cre elements, and as a consequence, CcpA does not regulate the catabolic operons. It is assumed that in the presence of high glucose concentrations, glucose is mainly transported independently from the PTS via the permease GlcU in a non-phosphorylated form and is subsequently phosphorylated by glucose kinase, GlkA. Respiratory Chain Taber and Morrison (1964) identified three cytochromes in S. aureus: cytochrome a-602 and cytochromes b-555 and b-557.",

Cytochrome b-557 is reduced in the presence of 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HOQNO), while all the other hemoproteins of the respiratory chain remain oxidized. In contrast to cytochromes a-602 and b-555, cytochrome b-557 is not reduced by ascorbatedichlorophenol-indophenol, suggesting that it has a lower reduction potential than the other cytochromes. The most significant difference, however, is that cytochrome b-557, unlike cytochromes b-555 and a-602, does not react with carbon monoxide. Cytochrome b-557 appears to be an intermediate electron carrier of the cytochrome b or b 1 -type. Cytochrome b-555, which is also found in S. epidermidis, binds carbon monoxide and probably is the major terminal oxidase; it is therefore, now referred to as \"cytochrome O.\" There are some indications that the prosthetic groups of cytochromes O and b-557 are protohemins. The role of cytochrome a-602 as a terminal oxidase is less clear. It may be involved with nitrate reductase activity. In particulate enzyme preparations from S. aureus, succinate oxidase, NAD-linked ethanol oxidase, and NADH-oxidase activities are detectable. Succinate oxidase activity is inhibited by ultraviolet (UV) light (340 nm) and surprisingly by amytal (barbiturate A), which inhibits electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone in higher organisms. The two oxidation-reduction dyes, methylene blue and 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol interact with the electron transfer system. The reduced form of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol reduces cytochrome a-602 and cytochrome O without reducing cytochrome b-557. It was found that trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) inhibited the growth of S. aureus but not of S. epidermidis. This selective inhibition of S. aureus was based on the inhibition of the electron transport system by oxidizing the cytochromes in S. aureus. It was suggested that the inhibition occurred between cytochrome b and cytochrome O (Suzuki et al., 1992) . Analysis of cytochrome spectra of S. aureus and other staphylococcal species revealed two more minor cytochromes of the b-type in addition to cytochromes a-602, b-557, and O-555 (Faller et al., 1980) . Cytochrome b-552 is found in all staphylococcal species except S. sciuri. Cytochromes b-560 and b-566 are widely distributed in staphylococci. Cytochromes of the c-type (e.g., c-549 and c-554) have been only found so far in S. sciuri, S. lentus and Macrococcus caseolyticus.",

Menaquinones are located in the cytoplasmic membrane (White and Frerman, 1967) and play important roles in electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Staphylococcus aureus uses aerobically very likely menaquinone oxidase(s) and at least four quinol oxidase-like genes (qoxA, B, C and D) were identified. Since the S. aureus qoxA to qoxD genes are very similar to the corresponding B. subtilis genes, we expect these genes will have a similar function. As all analyzed staphylococcal species possess a cytochrome a-605, we believe that this cytochrome is part of the S. aureus Qox system and functions as a second terminal oxidase.

The enzyme is regulated similar to dissimilatory enzymes, i.e., it is 1) repressed and inhibited by oxygen, 2) induced by anaerobiosis and nitrate or nitrite, and 3) not inhibited by its end product ammonia. The relatively low energy gain with nitrite under anaerobic conditions points towards a function as terminal electron acceptor, which might be important for the anaerobic recycling of NADH (Neubauer and G\u00f6tz, 1996) . In cells of S. carnosus, nitrate is reduced to ammonia in two steps. The first step includes uptake of nitrate, its reduction to nitrite and the subsequent excretion of nitrite. The second step takes place after depletion of nitrate: the accumulated nitrite is imported and reduced to ammonia, which accumulates in the medium. In growth yield studies, nitrate reduction appeared energetically more favorable than nitrite reduction, which makes sense since nitrate reduction is most likely coupled to the generation of a proton motive force. A comparison of the turnover rates in whole cells with glucose as electron donor reveals that nitrate reduction is 10-fold faster than nitrite reduction. For the inhibition of nitrite reduction by nitrate, two possible mechanisms are discussed which are not mutually exclusive. Both are based on the higher activity of nitrate compared to nitrite reductase. Both enzymes compete for NADH, which is in vivo the most important electron donor. Owing to its higher specific activity, nitrate reductase is expected to perform the bulk of NADH oxidation. In addition, the high rate of nitrate reduction could lead to an internal accumulation of nitrite, which could be the result of a less efficient nitrite reduction or export. High concentrations of nitrite (100 mM) effectively inhibit nitrite reductase but not nitrate reductase activity (Neubauer and G\u00f6tz, 1996) .",

Nitrite reduction in S. carnosus does not occur in the presence of oxygen and nitrate (Neubauer and G\u00f6tz, 1996) , which is in agreement with the fact that anaerobiosis, nitrite, and nitrate induce the nir promoter. Although a transcript is detectable, no nitrite reduction occurs in cells grown aerobically with nitrate or nitrite, indicating an additional oxygen-controlled step at the level of translation, enzyme folding, assembly, or insertion of prosthetic groups. The nitrite-reducing activity expressed during anaerobiosis is switched off reversibly when the oxygen tension increases, most likely owing to the competition for electrons with the aerobic respiratory chain. Another gene, nirC, is located upstream of the nir operon and encodes a putative integral membrane-spanning protein with unknown function. A nirC mutant showed no distinct phenotype. In S. carnosus, nitrate is first reduced to nitrite evidently by a dissimilatory enzyme. Nitrite accumulates in the growth medium and is further reduced by a dissimilatory NADHdependent nitrite reductase. Nitrite reduction only occurs in the absence of nitrate.",

The sequence characteristics identify ModB as the integralmembrane, channel-forming protein and ModC as the ATP-binding energizer for the transport system. Mutants defective in modABC revealed only 0.4% of wildtype nitrate reductase activity. Molybdate at a nonphysiologically high concentration (100 \u00b5M) fully restored nitrate reductase activity, suggesting that at least one other system is able to transport molybdate but with lower affinity. The expression of modA (and most likely modBC) was independent from oxygen and nitrate.

The staphylococcal peptidoglycan is a heteropolymer consisting of glycan strands crosslinked by peptides. According to the classification by Schleifer and Kandler (1972) , S. aureus has an A3\u03b1 peptidoglycan type. The peptide chain length is generally long in Gram-positive bacteria, yet the most extensively crosslinked peptidoglycan, that of S. aureus, has an average of about 15 repeating units and a maximal chain length of 30-40 peptide units (Snowden and Perkins, 1990; Henze et al., 1993) . In exponentially grown cells in rich medium, more than 95% of the subunits are crosslinked in S. aureus. This extremely high degree of crosslinking is possible only because their long and flexible pentaglycine interpeptide bridges are able to span distances between peptides otherwise much too far apart to be crosslinked (Ghuysen and Hakenbeck, 1994) .",

At this stage, cross-bridge formation occurs together with secondary modification of the newly synthesized peptidoglycan. Known genes Cell wall enzyme (enzymes) involved in the pathway of peptidoglycan biosynthesis are shown in Fig. 9 , and in Table 12 , annotated peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes of S. aureus N315 are listed. UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid is formed from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNac), UTP and N-acetylglucosamine-1-P. The synthesis of UDP-GlcNac starts from fructose-6-P and involves UTP-glucose-1-P uridyltransferase (GtaB), glucosamine-fructose-6-P aminotransferase (GlmS), and phosphoglucosamine-mutase GlmM (FemD). The UDP-N-acetylglucosaminepyrophosphorylase reaction is also involved in the synthesis of many other nucleotide-linked sugars. The next step is the formation of the first intermediate UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid. These reactions involve the transfer of a pyruvate enol ether from phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP-Nacetylglucosamine and its subsequent reduction to yield UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (Wickus et al., 1973) . The enzyme involved is UDP-Nacetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyl transferase. In the genome sequence, there are two transferases present, MurA and MurZ (MurB). The transferase activity was initially detected in cell-free (Strominger, 1965) . It was partially purified from S. epidermidis (Wickus et al., 1973) . The reaction is reversible and moreover specifically and irreversibly inhibited by fosfomycin. The UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate reductase was also purified from S. aureus (Wickus et al., 1973) . In all cases, NADPH is used as co-factor. The synthetases that catalyze the assembly of the peptide moiety of the peptidoglycan unit are cytoplasmic.",

First hints for an involvement of glycyl-tRNA were based on the finding that incorporation of glycine into polymeric peptidoglycan was prevented by ribonuclease. Under identical conditions, the incorporation of Nacetylmuramyl-peptide from the nucleotide precursor was unaffected. Five glycine residues activated by tRNA are added initially to the \u03b5-NH 2 group of lysine and then subsequently to the N-terminus of the growing peptide chain (Kamiryo and Matsuhashi, 1972) . This mechanism is in direct contrast to that of protein synthesis, which occurs by addition at the carboxyl terminus. The residues appeared to be added singly with no evidence for the involvement of peptidyl tRNA intermediates. The tRNA of S. aureus has been found to contain at least three species of glycyl-tRNA (Gly-tRNA). They can be used for the incorporation of glycine into peptidoglycan, whereas one of the species is inactive in protein synthesis. The formation of all Gly-tRNA is catalyzed by a single Gly-tRNA synthetase, which has been purified (Niyomporn et al., 1968) . A more complex situation has been found in S. epidermidis where four different pentapeptide cross-bridges have been shown to be present (Tipper and Berman, 1969) . Each contains glycine and L-serine residues in the ratio 3:2 in a characteristic sequence where glycine is always the initial substituent of the \u03b5-amino group of Llysine. Addition of the amino acids occur at the level of lipid intermediates, the transfer of glycine and serine from their respective tRNAs being catalyzed by membrane-bound enzymes. The incorporation of glycine is independent of that of serine, whereas maximum serine incorporation requires the simultaneous incorporation of glycine. Fractionation of tRNA of S. epidermidis has demonstrated the presence of four glycyland four seryl-tRNAs. In each case, all species, including one species of each type that did not participate in protein synthesis, were active in cross-bridge synthesis. The glycyl-tRNA with apparent specificity for peptidoglycan synthesis has been purified and shown to be made up of two distinct iso-accepting species (Roberts et al., 1974) . The two sequences define six spaces and the insertion of an additional base in the dehydrouridine loop of one. Thus, S. epidermidis appears to have developed a means of supplying glycine residues for cross-bridge synthesis without involving the machinery of protein synthesis.",

            "text": "The expression of methicillin resistance depends on several genes named \"fem\" (factors essential for methicillin resistance; Berger-B\u00e4chi, 1994). Recently, it was demonstrated that FmhB (FemX) links the first glycine residue to the \u03b5-amino group of lysine (Rohrer et al., 1999) . Evidence for this function was that, under conditions where fmhB is downregulated, unsubstituted peptidoglycan monomer precursors accumulate. Since FmhB is essential in S. aureus, it represents an ideal drug target. While FmhB incorporates the first glycyl residue, FemA incorporates glycyl residues 2 and 3 (Stranden et al., 1997) , and FemB, glycyl residues 4 and 5 (Henze et al., 1993) . Although FemA and FemB have a relatively high amino acid sequence identity (40%) and similarity (64%), they are specific and cannot substitute for each other. Null mutants of femAB are barely viable and depend on compensatory mutations for survival (Ling and Berger-B\u00e4chi, 1998) . Interestingly, S. aureus contains one glycyl-tRNA gene for protein biosynthesis and three nonproteinogenic glycyl-tRNA genes that are involved in cell wall biosynthesis (Green and Vold, 1993) . It is tempting to speculate that the two Fem factors and FmhB may preferentially recognize one of the three glycyl-tRNA species. The site of glycine incorporation in the peptidoglycan is shown in Fig. 10 .",

If in addition to lif, lss is coexpressed, the serine-glycine ratio is further increased to 58%, suggesting that Lss selects for optimal serine incorporation. Lif shows similarity to FemA and FemB proteins, which are involved in the biosynthesis of the glycine interpeptide bridge of staphylococcal peptidoglycan. In contrast to Lif, the production of FemA and FemB in S. carnosus does not cause lysostaphin immunity (Thumm and G\u00f6tz, 1997) . The putative tRNA Ser gene located downstream of lss had no recognizable influence on lysostaphin immunity. The lss and lif genes are flanked by insertion sequences, suggesting that S. simulans biovar staphylolyticus received lif and lss by horizontal gene transfer. Recently, it was shown that Lif and Epr lead to incorporation of serine residues into the staphylococcal peptidoglycan interpeptide bridges specifically at positions 3 and 5 and that this incorporation requires the presence of FemA and/or FemB (Ehlert et al., 2000) .",

It was suggested that D-alanyl-Dalanine-dipeptide appeared to be involved in the formation of these cross-linkages. When sublethal concentrations of penicillin were applied, the walls contained an increase in the free amino groups of glycine and an excess of alanine over those walls prepared from organisms grown in the absence of penicillin. These observations were independently confirmed by direct chemical analysis of staphylococcal walls prepared from organisms grown under similar conditions (Tipper and Strominger, 1968) . In the presence of penicillin, an increased synthesis of uncross-linked peptide monomer units was observed. These units retained the complete D-alanyl-Dalanine terminus of the nucleotide precursor and were substituted with the pentaglycine crossbridge peptide on the \u03b5-amino group of L-lysine. During subsequent growth of the organism in the absence of penicillin, these monomer units did not become crosslinked. To explain these observations, it was proposed that incorporation of the newly synthesized disaccharide-peptide occurred at the wall-membrane interface with almost immediate formation of crosslinks to adjacent peptide side chains. In staphylococci, units synthesized in the presence of penicillin could not form crosslinks on the subsequent removal of the antibiotic because continued synthesis of linear uncross-linked peptidoglycan during the initial penicillin treatment moved these units outside the reach of the transpeptidase molecules. These in vivo studies supported the conclusion that crosslinkage in peptidoglycan occurred by means of a transpeptidation reaction inhibited by \u03b2lactam antibiotics.",

Do cells lyse because their walls can no longer expand so that the cell bursts? Is autolytic action essential? One possible way to answer these questions would be to stop the formation of autolysins by blocking protein synthesis. A combination of chloramphenicol and penicillins is not bactericidal for E. coli or for staphylococci (Rogers et al., 1980b) . Lysis of staphylococci could also be stopped, as with B. subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, by the inhibition of protein synthesis. However, to date the answers to these questions have been inconclusive. The observation that an autolytic deficient strain of S. aureus failed to show wall turnover, although the wildtype turnover rate was rather slow (Chatterjee et al., 1976) should be reevaluated. Suginaka et al. (1979) have shown that the addition of homologous lipoteichoic acid to cultures of S. aureus treated with penicillin prevents lysis and death of the bacteria. Forssman antigen (lipoteichoic acid from pneumococci) can also prevent penicillin-induced lysis in S. aureus. Lipoteichoic acids or lipids certainly regulate the action of autolysins in vivo. It was also found that wall autolysis is inhibited by sodium polyanethole sulfonate \"liquoid\" (Wecke et al., 1986) . The inhibition is not due to direct interaction with the autolysins, and liquoid blocks very likely the target structures of autolysins, especially the wall teichoic acid (WTA).",

This resistance to infection is nonspecific and extends to unrelated species of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. A key mechanism of the resistance to infection is activation of macrophages. Macrophage activation results in increased production of microbicidal oxygen radicals like superoxide and peroxide, and in increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. These cytokines, besides activating neutrophils, B lymphocytes, and T lymphocytes, act on the central nervous system to induce physiological responses like fever and sleep. These physiological responses also aid in combating infection. Muramyl peptides activate macrophages and other cells of the immune system to kill cancer cells. It is therefore believed that muramyl peptides and similar agents will become more important as therapeutic agents in the future, owing to increasing resistance of microbes to antibiotics, and increasing numbers of patients with immunodeficiencies (Pabst et al., 1999) .",

Characterization of vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRSA) strains from all over the world confirmed that emergence of vancomycin resistance in S. aureus is a global issue. A certain group of S. aureus, designated \"hetero-VRSA,\" frequently generates VRSA upon exposure to vancomycin, and is associated with infections that are potentially refractory to vancomycin therapy (Hiramatsu, 2001) . Vancomycin resistance is acquired via mutation and cell wall thickening, due to accumulation of excess amounts of peptidoglycan. This seems to be a common resistance mechanism for all VRSA strains isolated so far (Geisel et al., 2001; Komatsuzawa et al., 2002) . By exposure to vancomycin, a resistant S. aureus COL mutant was isolated. This mutant showed decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin (8-fold), methicillin (2-fold), macarbomycin (8-fold), and moenomycin (16-fold). Macarbomycin and moenomycin are thought to directly inhibit transglycosylase activity. Characterization of the mutant revealed a thickened cell wall and suppression of penicillin-induced lysis, although the amounts of the five penicillinbinding proteins (PBPs 1, 2, 3 and 4) and MecA, and the profiles of peptidoglycan hydrolases were not altered. Analysis of muropeptide profile and glycan chain length distribution by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed slightly decreased peptide crosslinking and an increased average glycan chain length compared to those of the parent. These results together suggest that a transglycosylase activity was enhanced in the mutant. This may represent a novel mechanism of glycopep-tide resistance in S. aureus (Komatsuzawa et al., 2002) .",

In June, the patient developed a suspected catheter exit-site infection, and the temporary dialysis catheter was removed; cultures of the exit site and catheter tip subsequently grew S. aureus resistant to oxacillin (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] > 16 \u00b5g/ml) and vancomycin (MIC > 128 \u00b5g/ml).

The blanket resistance of methicillinresistant S. aureus to all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics is related to the properties of the key component of this resistance mechanism: the \"acquired\" penicillin-binding protein MecA, which has unusual low affinity for all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Until now, the accepted model of resistance had implied that in the presence of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, MecA must take over the biosynthesis of staphylococcal cell wall from the four native staphylococcal PBPs (PBP1, PBP2, PBP3 and PBP4) because the latter become rapidly acylated and inactivated at even low concentrations of the antibiotic. However, recent observations indicate that this model requires revision. Inactivation of the transglycosylase domain, but not the transpeptidase domain, of MecA of S. aureus prevents expression of \u03b2-lactam resistance, despite the presence of the low-affinity MecA. The observations suggest that cell-wall synthesis in the presence of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics requires the cooperative functioning of the transglycosylase domain of the native staphylococcal PBP2 and the transpeptidase domain of the MecA (Pinho et al., 2001) . There are indications that the mecA gene was acquired from S. sciuri which is, however, uniformly susceptible to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Recently, it was shown that the mecA homologue in S. sciuri is hardly expressed but is well expressed by a single mutation in the promoter region and provides methicillin resistance in a susceptible S. aureus strain. This supports the proposition that the mecA homologue ubiquitous in the antibiotic-susceptible animal species (S. sciuri) may indeed be an evolutionary precursor of the methicillin resistance gene mecA of the pathogenic strains of MRSA (Wu et al., 2001) .",

When \u03b2-lactam antibiotics saturate the normal set of staphylococcal PBPs, the cell wall is still produced due to the presence of MecA but is drastically hypocrosslinked.

Consequently, some isolates, referred to as \"pre-MRSA,\" are methicillinsensitive despite carrying the mecA gene. However, selective pressure through antibiotic usage has promoted S. aureus isolates that have mutations or deletions in mecI or the mecA promoter/ operator region, giving rise to an inactive repressor and constitutive mecA expression. These mutants can display homogeneous (all cells are resistant to high concentrations of methicillin [>128 \u00b5g/liter]) or heterogeneous (only a small minority of cells exhibit high-level methicillin resistance) methicillin resistance phenotypes (Kondo et al., 2001) .",

In S. aureus (glycerol phosphate)-2-ManNAc-[ 14 C]GlcNAc-PP-prenol as well as (glycerol phosphate)-3-ManNAc-[ 14 C]GlcNAc-PP-prenol served as an acceptor for ribitol phosphate units, but (glycerol phosphate)-ManNAc-[ 14 C]GlcNAc-PP-prenol did not. The covalent attachment of WTA to peptidoglycan does not appear to play a role in the maintenance of the shape or rigidity of the cell wall, since their extraction with trichloracetic acid (TCA) leaves an essentially intact residual wall structure (Baddiley, 1972 ). While the cell-biological functions of LTA are manifold, not much is known about WTA, which however plays an important role as bacteriophage receptor (Schleifer and Steber, 1974) . It was for a long time an open question whether WTA is essential for growth. Recently in the group of A. Peschel, a completely WTA negative deletion mutant was isolated which exhibits normal growth but became resistant to a number of bacteriophages was impaired in adherence to nasal cells, and was completely unable to colonize cotton rat nares (Weidenmaier et al., 2004) .",

The average chain length of polyglycerol phosphate was 45-50 units; 70% of the glycerophosphate units were esterified with D-alanine, 15% bore \u03b1-D-Nacetylglucosamine, and 15% had no substituents.

Indeed it was found that the alanine ester content influences the magnesium binding capacity of walls of S. aureus H grown at different pH values (Archibald et al., 1973) . Fischer and coworkers investigated the influence of the degree of D-alanine esterification of staphylococcal LTA on autolysin activity using extracellular autolysin from S. aureus (Fischer et al., 1981) . It turned out that the inhibitory activity was highest with D-alanine-free LTA. Glycosylation of LTA up to an extent of 0.5 did not depress inhibitory activity. They hypothesized that the anti-autolytic activity of LTA resides in a sequence of glycerophosphate units and that the negative charges of appropriately spaced phosphodiester groups play a crucial role. This work shows that autolysis is regulated in vivo by the alanine ester content of the LTA, and very likely by the WTA too, which also carries ester bound D-alanine. LTA is also an important antigen (Knox and Wicken, 1973) . Some of the biological properties of the staphylococcal envelope components are listed in Table 13 .",

One must be aware that frequently these preparations are inhomogeneous and contain decomposed LTA and endotoxins of more than 10 ng of LPS/mg of LTA . A novel isolation procedure has been worked out that leads to a pure (> 99%) biologically active LTA, allowing the first structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. A comparison with LTA purified by standard techniques revealed that alanine substituents are lost during standard purification, resulting in attenuated cytokine induction activity. In line with this finding, hydrolysis of alanine substituents of active LTA eliminated cytokine induction. Purified S. aureus LTA induced the release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 in human whole blood. Soluble CD14 (sCD14) inhibited monokine induction by LTA but failed to confer LTA responsiveness for IL-6 and IL-8 release of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In a competitive LPS-binding protein (LBP) binding assay, the IC 50 of the tested LTA preparations was up to 3230-fold higher than for LPS. The LBP enhanced TNF-\u03b1 release of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon LPS but not LTA stimulation. These data demonstrate a differential role for the serum proteins LBP and sCD14 in the recognition of LPS and LTA . There is evidence that the recognition sites of CD14 for LPS and LTA are distinct with a partial overlap. While the maximal achievable monokine release in response to LTA or to LPS was comparable, all LTA induced significantly less IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3. IL-12 substitution increased LTA-inducible IFN-\u03b3 release up to 180-fold, suggesting a critical role of poor LTA-inducible IL-12 for IFN-\u03b3 formation. Pretreatment with IFN-\u03b3 rendered galactosamine-sensitized mice sensitive to challenge with LTA. When compared to LPS, LTA (a major immunostimulatory component of S. aureus) is a weak inducer of IL-12 and subsequent IFN-\u03b3 formation, which might explain the lower toxicity in vivo.",

            "text": "In a recent study, the effects of LPS from E. coli, LTA and peptidoglycan (PG) from S. aureus and live S. aureus on leukocyte-endothelial interactions in vivo have been investigated (Yipp et , 2002) . It was found that local administration of LPS into muscle induced significant leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and emigration in postcapillary venules at the site of injection. Given systemically, LPS caused circulating leukocyte counts to drop dramatically and neutrophil counts to increase in the lung. However, the drop in circulating leukocytes was not associated with leukocyte sequestration to the site of injection (peritoneum) or to peripheral microvessels in muscles. Unlike LPS, LTA had no systemic and very minor local effect on leukocyteendothelium interactions, even at high doses and prolonged exposure. LPS, but not LTA, potently activated human endothelium to recruit leukocytes under flow conditions in vitro. Endothelial adhesion molecule expression was also increased extensively with LPS, but not LTA. Interestingly, systemic administration of live S. aureus induced leukocyte-endothelial cell responses similar to LPS. PG was able to induce leukocyteendothelial interactions in muscle and peritoneum, but had no effect systemically (no increase in neutrophils in lungs and no decrease in circulating neutrophil counts). These results demonstrate that: 1) LPS has potent, but divergent local and systemic effects on leukocyte-endothelial interactions; and 2) S. aureus can induce a systemic response similar to LPS, but this response is unlikely to be due to LTA, but more likely to be mediated in part by PG. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in cellular activation by microbial products, including lipopolysaccharide, lipoproteins, and peptidoglycan. Although for these ligands the specific transmembrane signal transducers TLR-4, TLR-2, or TLR-2 and -6 have now been identified, the molecular basis of recognition of LTA and related glycolipids has not been completely understood. Purified LTAs from S. aureus and B. subtilis exhibited TLR-2 dependence in nuclear factor \u03baB activation and cytokine induction. The signaling molecules MyD88 and NIK appear to be also involved in cell stimulation by LTA (Opitz et al., 2001) . The results presented here suggest that TLR-2 is the main receptor for the LTA-mediated inflammatory response.",

As a result the cells carry an increased negative surface charge and bound fewer anionic, but more positively charged peptides and proteins (Peschel et al., 1999) . In addition, they became much more sensitive to human defensins, animal-derived protegrins, tachyplesins, and magainin II, and to the lantibiotics gallidermin and nisin. The mutation was located within the dlt genes involved in the transfer of D-alanine into teichoic acids. The fact that high concentrations of magnesium ions compromised the protective properties of D-alanine esters corroborates the hypothesis that the increased negative charge of the cell wall is responsible for the hypersensitivity against positively charged antimicrobial peptides. These results also show that the D-alanine-esterification of teichoic acids (which occurs in many Gram-positive bacteria) is not essential for growth but is essential in the protection against human and animal defense systems (Peschel et al., 1999) . The innate immune system is largely based on the release of defensins by immune cells and various tissue cells such as epithelial or endothelial cells. Therefore, dltA mutants should be less virulent than wild type cells. Indeed it was demonstrated that the S. aureus dltA mutant lacking D-alanine modifications of teichoic acids is highly susceptible to neutrophil killing and is virulence-attenuated in mice (Collins et al., 2002) . These results clearly show that D-alanine-esterification of teichoic acids is a virulence factor.",

They are not only produced by mammals but also by insects and bacteria (Sahl and Bierbaum, 1998) . CAMPs represent an important human defense mechanism, protecting skin and epithelia against invading microorganisms and assisting neutrophils and platelets. Staphylococcus aureus and other bacterial pathogens have evolved countermeasures to limit the effectiveness of CAMPs, including the repulsion of CAMPs by reducing the net negative charge of the bacterial cell envelope through covalent modification of anionic molecules (e.g., teichoic acids, phospholipids and lipid A). Mutants susceptible to CAMPs are more efficiently inactivated by phagocytes and are virulence-attenuated, indicating that CAMP resistance plays a key role in bacterial infections as reviewed by Peschel (2002) .",

Protein A is covalently bound via its C-terminal end to the pentaglycine interpeptide bridge of peptidoglycans and can be released by treatment with lysostaphin, a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase. Protein A (Spa) was one of the first proteins shown to be covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan. Protein A is synthesized as a precursor, containing an N-terminal signal peptide, a pro-peptide region, five IgG-binding domains (Moks et al., 1986) , a cell-wall spanning region, and finally a 35-residue cell wall sorting (cws) sequence which is conserved in surface anchored proteins of most Gram-positive bacteria (Schneewind et al., 1992) . The cws consists of the typical LPXTG motif, which is followed by a hydrophobic domain and a tail of mostly positively charged residues. Mutations at the LPXTG motif lead normally to the secretion of the mutant protein into the extracellular medium. Deletion of this motif prevents cleavage and cell wall anchoring of protein A.

The first reports that slime-producing S. epidermidis strains are involved in catheter-associated sepsis and infections came from the groups of Peters (Peters et al., 1981) , Christensen (Christensen et al., 1982) , and Costerton (Marrie et al., 1982b) . Mostly S. epidermidis, but sometimes also mixed cultures have been isolated from colonized catheters recovered from patients. The bacteria appeared to be closely packed and cemented together by a slimy matrix (Peters et al., 1981) . Transmission and scanning electron micrographs showed again that S. epidermidis forms a confluent biofilm, in which the cells are embedded in an amorphous material referred to as \"slime\" (Christensen et al., 1982) . These early observations and pioneering work indicated that 1) the skin bacterium S. epidermidis, once considered to be harmless, is an opportunistic pathogen that could cause chronic staphylococcal infection and 2) in certain strains, slime (an extracellular polysaccharide) is produced and contributes to the formation of a confluent biofilm. As summarized recently, S. epidermidis can form a biofilm on nearly any synthetic polymers used as prosthetic devices, and in addition, they can bind to blood proteins, matrix proteins, and human cell receptors (G\u00f6tz and Peters, 2000a; G\u00f6tz et al., 2000b) . Today S. epidermidis is regarded as a leading species in causing chronic polymer-associated clinical infection. Microscopy of biofilm formation in vitro suggests that two steps are involved: 1) the attachment of the bacterial cells to the polymer surface, and 2) the growth-dependent accumulation to form multilayered cell clusters surrounded by a slimy matrix (Fig. 13) .",

IcaA has N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as substrate.

In the mprF mutant, the predominant membrane component phosphatidylglycerol lacks L-lysine modification. The structure of lysylphosphatidylglycerol (L-PG) is shown in Fig. 14. As this unusual modification leads to a reduced negative charge of the membrane surface, MprF-mediated peptide resistance is most likely based on repulsion of the cationic peptides. Accordingly, inactivation of mprF led to increased binding of antimicrobial peptides by the bacteria. The mprF gene has no similarity with genes of known function, but related genes were identified in the genomes of several pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. MprF thus constitutes a novel virulence factor, which may be of general relevance for bacterial pathogens and represents a new target for attacking multidrug resistant bacteria.",

The presence of most of the sec genes suggests that in S. aureus, the sec pathway is essentially similar to that described for E. coli.

A structural organization of some of the lipases is shown in Fig. 15 .

To get more insight into the function of the pro-peptide, internal deletions within this region were made and analyzed (Demleitner and G\u00f6tz, 1994) . The results obtained with these lipase mutants indicate that the SHL pro-peptide may have two functional domains, with each one located in one half of the pro-region. The N-terminal part seems to be important for lipase activity and the Cterminal part, for translocation and stability. A stabilizing effect of the SHL pro-peptide has also been observed in an experiment where OmpA of E. coli is fused to the pre-pro portion of SHL; without the SHL pro-peptide, massive proteolytic degradation occurred after secretion by S. carnosus (Meens et al., 1997) . A number of experiments designed to address the question whether the pro-peptide could act also in trans indicated that it has no trans activity. It exerts its beneficial effects on translocation, stability, and activity only intramolecularly (G. Thumm et al., unpublished observation) . All studies carried with the pro-peptide speak in favor of an intramolecular chaperon-like function. Maybe it compensates in Staphylococcus and also in Bacillus for the lack of the SecB homolog.",

Since the 86-kDa pro-SHL purified from S. carnosus is processed by culture supernatants of S. hyicus, it became apparent that the processing of the pro-region by an extracellular protease occurs after secretion. The proteolytic activities in the supernatant of S. hyicus were analyzed, and two proteases (ShpI and ShpII) were identified; ShpII proved to be involved in pro-SHL processing (Ayora and G\u00f6tz, 1994a; Ayora et al., 1994b) .",

This clearly reflects the difference in the pathogenic potential of the three species representatives and explains why S. aureus is rather an aggressive pathogen, S. epidermidis a mild pathogen and S. carnosus is non-pathogenic. Of the 40 toxin genes in S. aureus, only 3 and 5, respectively, were identified in the S. epidermidis and S. carnosus genome. This finding is in agreement with the earlier observations of decreased toxin production of S. epidermidis and corroborates well with the decreased severity of an S. epidermidis infection. Compared to S. aureus, S. carnosus was also found to have a much decreased number of other potential virulence factors such as exoenzymes and adhesins. This is only a preliminary study since the S. epidermidis and S. carnosus genomes were only screened for the presence of known S. aureus virulence genes. On the other hand, not many virulence genes are known in S. epidermidis. However, this first analysis may shed some light why S. epidermidis causes rather mild or chronic infections.

However, the latter designation, does not consider the findings that these peptide pheromones not only induce the native agr system but also act at the same time as inhibitors of foreign agr systems. Therefore, the less restrictive term \"peptide pheromone\" is preferred. The first hint that a peptide acts as an autoinducer of the agr system in S. aureus comes from the group of R. Novick. It turned out that the staphylococcal peptide pheromone sequences that are encoded in agrD gene vary from species to species. Even within S. aureus, four subtypes were identified (Ji et al., 1997) . The first structure of a pheromone peptide and its biological activity was described in 1998 (Otto et al., 1998) . The peptide sequence, DSVCASYF, was derived from AgrD of S. epidermidis. This synthetic octapeptide revealed only autoinducing activity when it contained the thiolactone ring between the central cysteine and the C-terminal carboxyl group (DSVc [CASYF] ). The structure of the peptide pheromone of S. epidermidis is shown in Fig. 17 . Unmodified peptides showed no activity (Otto et al., 1998) . The receptor for the peptide pheromones, AgrC, must be very sensitive since the thiolactones are active at nanomolar concentrations. The N-terminus of the peptide pheromones is crucial for biological activity and specificity (Otto et al., 1998) .",

However, while the correct N-terminus and the thiolactone structure were absolute prerequisites for an agractivating effect in S. epidermidis, inhibition of the S. aureus agr system showed a lesser structural stringency. Another important finding was that the corresponding lactone-and lactamcontaining peptides DSVc [SASYF] and DSVc[DprASYF] inhibit the S. aureus agr system, but have lost autoinducing activity in its native S. epidermidis agr system . The S. epidermidis thiolactone inhibits the agr subgroups 1-3 but not 4 ). An explanation for this could be that subgroup 4 thiolactone is very similar to that of S. epidermidis. A series of autoinducing peptide analogues (including the L-alanine and D-amino acid scanned peptides) were synthesized to determine the functionally critical residues within the S. aureus group I. It was found that 1) the group I autoinducing peptide (YSTc [CDFIM] ) is inactivated in culture supernatants by the formation of the corresponding methionyl sulfoxide, and 2) that the lactam analogue retains the capacity to activate agr, suggesting that the thiolactone structure, which would allow covalent modification of the AgrC receptor, is not a necessary prerequisite for agr activation. Replacement of the endocyclic amino acid residue (D-aspartate) with alanine converted the group I thiolactone from an activator to a potent inhibitor. The addition of exogenous agr inhibitors to S. aureus decreased the production of TSST-1 and enterotoxin C3, confirming the potential of quorum-sensing blockade as a therapeutic strategy (Dowell et al., 2001) .",

The global agr regulatory system is itself controlled by another regulator, namely the sar regulation system. This regulation system was first identified by Ambrose Cheung and his colleagues (Cheung et al., 1992) . The sar locus consists of the 372-bp sarA preceded by a triple promoter region interspersed with two smaller open reading frames (ORFs) ORF3 and ORF4 (Bayer et al., 1996) .

The protein sequence of the 14-kDa SarA shares sequence similarity with VirF of Shigella flexneri (Cheung and Projan, 1994) . Mutations in sarA resulted in a decreased expression of several extracellular (especially \u03b1hemolysin) and cell wall proteins.

ArlS is the sensor protein while ArlR represents the response regulator. An arlS mutant showed pleiotropic effects. It formed a biofilm on a polystyrene surface unlike the parent strain and the complemented mutant strain. Biofilm formation was associated with increased primary adherence to polystyrene, whereas cellular adhesion was only slightly decreased. In addition, the arlS mutant exhibited increased autolysis and altered peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Another effect of the arlS mutant is that the activity of multidrug resistance efflux pump, NorA, is increased (Fournier et al., 2000b) . While in the arlS or arlR mutants, the extracellular proteolytic activity, including serine protease activity, is dramatically decreased (Fournier and Hooper, 2000a) , and transcription and production of other secreted proteins such as \u03b1and \u03b2-hemolysins, lipase, coagulase, or the cell-wall bound protein A are increased (Fournier et al., 2001) . The arl operon decreases the production of virulence factors by transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding genes. Since the arl mutation did not change spa expression in an agr or sarA mutant, it is suggested that arl acts indirectly on virulence gene expression through agr and sar. This is supported by the finding that RNAII and RNAIII are decreased by ArlS-ArlR, while sarA expression is increased.",

In the course of studies examining the mechanism by which oxygen might regulate toxin production, the srrAB (staphylococcal respiratory response) genes were identified. The genes are homologous to the B. subtilis resDE genes. ResD-ResE represents a global regulator of aerobic and anaerobic respiratory metabolism in B. subtilis. The twocomponent regulatory system SrrA-SrrB very likely acts in anaerobic repression of staphylococcal virulence factors (Yarwood et al., 2001) . In srrB mutants, RNAIII synthesis was upregulated while exotoxin TSST-1 synthesis was downregulated under microaerobic conditions and, to a lesser extent, under aerobic conditions as well. At the same time, protein A production was upregulated in microaerobic conditions and decreased in aerobic conditions. Overexpression of srrAB resulted in nearly complete repression of TSST-1 production in both microaerobic and aerobic conditions. It is assumed that SrrA-SrrB acts in the global regulation of staphylococcal virulence factors, and may repress virulence factors under low-oxygen conditions. Furthermore, srrAB may provide a mechanistic link between respiratory metabolism, environmental signals, and regulation of virulence factors in S. aureus (Yarwood et al., 2001) . This regulation is mediated in part by agr.",

A third protein, the anti-anti \u03c3 factor RsbV, which can also bind to RsbW, accomplishes release of SigB from RsbW. The phosphorylation status of RsbV is critical for its binding to RsbW. In its unmodified form, RsbV forms a complex with RsbW, whereas P-RsbV is unable to bind to RsbW that can then form a complex with SigB. This novel regulatory principle was called \"partner switching'' (Alper et al., 1994) . Antagonistic activities of a kinase and two phosphatases control the phosphorylation status of RsbV. In addition, RsbW is also an RsbV kinase, whereas RsbU (phosphatase) dephosphorylates P-RsbV.

Resident bacteria are indigenous to the host, maintain relatively stable populations, and increase in numbers mainly by multiplication of those already present. Transient bacteria are derived from exogenous sources, found primarily on exposed skin, and may be easily washed away. Crosscontamination of staphylococci can occur readily where different host species come in contact with one another, but where host specificity is high, the transient organisms will usually be eliminated within several hours or days, unless the normal defense barriers are compromised. Ideally, determination of natural host range should be made with host species that are relatively isolated in nature. Most of the ecological studies reported fall short of this ideal situation, but a few have indicated some clear patterns of host and niche preferences for certain Staphylococcus species.",

            "text": "Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most prevalent and persistent Staphylococcus species on human skin. It is found over much of the body surface and produces the largest populations where moisture content and nutrition are high, such as in the anterior nares, axillae, inguinal and perineal area, and toe webs. This species may be found occasionally on other hosts, such as domestic animals, but it is presumably transferred there from human sources. Staphylococcus hominis is also prevalent on human skin. Its population size is usually second or equal to S. epidermidis on skin sites where apocrine glands are numerous (e.g., in the axillae and inguinal and perineal areas). It can also colonize the drier regions of skin (e.g., on the extremities) more successfully than other species. Staphylococcus haemolyticus shares many of the habitats of S. hominis, but it is usually found in smaller populations. Some individuals may carry unusually large populations of S. haemolyticus. A different subspecies of S. haemolyticus found living on nonhuman primate skin (e.g., Pan, Macaca, Cercocebus, Erythrocebus, Microcebus and Lemur skin) can be distinguished from the human-adapted subspecies on the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization (Kloos and Wolfshohl, 1979) . Since it is difficult to distinguish colonies of the nonhuman primate S. haemolyticus subspecies from a sibling species, provisionally designated \"S. simians,\" found also on nonhuman primate skin, adequate enumeration of this subspecies is not yet possible. Staphylococcus warneri is found usually in small numbers on human skin, though a few individuals may carry unusually large populations. Staphylococcus warneri is a major species on nonhuman primates, especially on the more advanced Cercopithecoidea and Pongidae. Occasionally, small transient populations of S. haemolyticus or S. warneri may be isolated from domestic animals. Staphylococcus capitis produces large populations on the human scalp following puberty. It is also found on other regions of the adult head, e.g., forehead, face, eyebrows, and external auditory meatus in moderate-sized to large populations. The largest populations are found in areas where sebaceous glands are numerous and well developed. Staphylococcus capitis subsp. ureolyticus is present on regions of the head in rather small populations and, like S. capitis, may be found only occasionally on other body sites (Bannerman and Kloos, 1991) . This subspecies has been isolated from both human and nonhuman primate skin (e.g., Pan skin).",

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, S. aureus caused considerable morbidity and mortality as a nosocomial pathogen. Among the major human infections caused by this species are furuncles, carbuncles, impetigo, toxic epidermal necrolysis (scalded skin syndrome), pneumonia, osteomyelitis, acute endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, enterocolitis, mastitis, cystitis, prostatitis, cervicitis, cerebritis, meningitis, bacteremia, toxic shock syndrome, and abscesses of the muscle, skin, urogenital tract, central nervous system, and various intraabdominal organs. In addition, staphylococcal enterotoxin is involved in food poisoning. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains have emerged in the 1980s as a major clinical and epidemiological problem in hospitals. These strains are beginning to spread out of the hospitals and into communities. The origin and future significance of these isolates to the community has yet to be determined.",

The increase in infections by these organisms has been correlated with the wide medical use of prosthetic and indwelling devices and the growing number of immunocompromised patients in hospitals. Infectious processes may result from the introduction of endogenous staphylococci beyond the normal integumentary barriers. Staphylococcus epidermidis appears to have the greatest pathogenic potential and adaptive diversity. This species has been implicated in bacteremia, native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pyoarthritis, peritonitis during continuous ambulatory dialysis, mediastinitis, infections of permanent pacemakers, vascular grafts, cerebrospinal fluid shunts, prosthetic joints, and a variety of orthopedic devices, and urinary tract infections including cystitis, urethritis, and pyelonephritis. Recent reviews have been published on the nature of human infections caused by S. epidermidis and other coagulasenegative species Rupp and Archer, 1994; Crossley and Archer, 1997) . Nosocomial methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) strains became a serious clinical problem in the 1980s, especially in patients with prosthetic heart valves or who had undergone other forms of cardiac surgery (Archer and Tenenbaum, 1980; Karchmer et al., 1983) . Staphylococcus epidermidis has also been occasionally associated with mastitis in cattle (Baba et al., 1980; Devriese and De Keyser, 1980; Holmberg, 1986) .",

Staphylococcus haemolyticus is the second most frequently encountered species of this group found in human clinical infections. It has been implicated in native valve endocarditis, septicemia, peritonitis, and urinary tract infections, and is occasionally associated with wound, bone, and joint infections. Staphylococcus haemolyticus has been occasionally associated with mastitis in cattle (Baba et al., 1980) . Staphylococcus caprae, previously misidentified as S. haemolyticus, S. hominis and S. warneri, is widely distributed in human clinical specimens (Kawamura et al., 1998) and has been implicated in cases of infective endocarditis, bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. Staphylococcus lugdunensis has been implicated in native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, septicemia, brain abscess, and chronic osteoarthritis and infections of soft tissues, bone, peritoneal fluid, and catheters, especially in patients with underlying diseases. Staphylococcus schleiferi has been implicated in human brain empyema, osteoarithritis, bacteremia, wound infections, and infections associated with a cranial drain and jugular catheter. This species occurs less frequently than S. lugdunensis in the hospital environment and human infections. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is an important opportunistic pathogen in human urinary tract infections, especially in young, sexually active females. It is considered to be the second most common cause of urinary tract infections, such as acute cystitis or pyelonephritis, in these patients. This species can also produce in men urinary tract infections, which (unlike those in women) occur most commonly in the elderly with predisposing diseases of the urinary tract (Marrie et al., 1982a; Hovelius et al., 1984; Hovelius, 1986) . Staphylococcus saprophyticus has occasionally been isolated from wound infections and septicemia (Marsik and Brake, 1982; Fleurette et al., 1987) .",

In most cases, patients with these infections had predisposing or underlying diseases that drastically altered their immune systems, and had also experienced surgery or intravascular manipulations. Staphylococcus warneri has been on occasion the etiologic agent of vertebral osteomyelitis, native valve endocarditis, and urinary tract infections in males and females. This species has been associated with mastitis in cattle (Devriese and Derycke, 1979b; Devriese and De Keyser, 1980) . Staphylococcus simulans has been associated with human chronic osteomyelitis, pyarthrosis, and bovine mastitis. Staphylococcus felis, a relative of S. simulans, has been isolated from clinical infections in cats, including external ear otitis, cystitis, abscesses, wounds, and other skin infections (Igimi et al., 1989) . Staphylococcus capitis has been implicated in endocarditis, septicemia, and catheter infections. Staphylococcus hominis has been associated with human endocarditis, peritonitis, septicemia, and arthritis. Some of the earlier reports indicating an association of this species with infections were in error, owing to the misidentification of phosphatase-negative strains of S. epidermidis as S. hominis. Staphylococcus cohnii has been associated with urinary tract infections and arthritis. Staphylococcus chromogenes, a close relative of S. hyicus, is commonly isolated from the milk of cows suffering from mastitis, although its role as an etiologic agent is questionable (Devriese and De Keyser, 1980; Langlois et al., 1983; Watts et al., 1984) . Staphylococcus sciuri subspecies has been iso-lated from wound, skin, and soft tissue infections (Marsou et al., 1999) .",

The predominant microorganism in fermented meat is S. carnosus, appearing in the early literature as Micrococcus . For more than 50 years, S. carnosus has been used alone or in combination with lactobacilli or pediococci, as a starter culture for the production of raw fermented sausages. One of the main advantages of starter cultures in fermented food processing is that the fermentation and ripening process can be carried out under controlled conditions. In this way, food-poisoning and foodspoilage microorganisms can be suppressed, and the course of the fermentation process and its termination more reliably monitored. During the ripening process of dry sausage, S. carnosus exerts several desired functions (Liepe and Porobic, 1983; G\u00f6tz, 1990) . First, S. carnosus gradually reduces nitrate to nitrite and nitrite to ammonia. The advantage of this reaction is that the nitrate concentration is lowered, and that nitrite can combine with myoglobin to form nitrosomyoglobin, which gives the typical red color. As outlined above, nitrite is further reduced to the ammonia thus lowering the unbound nitrite concentration (Neubauer and G\u00f6tz, 1996) . Other advantages are development of characteristic flavor, lowering the pH moderately, and the capacity to reduce hydrogen peroxide produced by the catalase-negative lactobacilli, thus preventing odors.",
