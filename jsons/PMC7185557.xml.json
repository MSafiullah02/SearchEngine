It is a contagious disease, transmitted through water or soil contaminated with urine of animal hosts containing a large number of this pathogenic spirochete. This zoonosis generally appears as a seasonal infection that initiates at the beginning of monsoon, occurs frequently during the rainy season and disappears when the rains recede; except few sporadic cases that may happen throughout the year [1], [2]. Due to the increasing number of severe leptospirosis infections in developed and developing countries, it has been recognized as a major health problem [3]. Additionally, this emerging infectious disease can adversely affect agricultural industry [4]. Consequently, this fatal infectious zoonosis has a devastating impact on human health and corresponding impediment to economic improvement worldwide.",

            "text": "Leptospirosis is a systemic disease of humans and broad range of feral and domestic animals, which is characterized by fever, myalgia, conjunctival suffusion, renal and hepatic insufficiency, pulmonary manifestations and reproductive failure [5]. Renal involvement is very common in leptospirosis patients and severe cases often lead to acute renal failure. Pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage is the prime cause of leptospirosis related casualties [6]. Successful completion of the genome sequence of Leptospira interrogans\n[7] has paved the emergence of omics-based approaches in leptospirosis research [8]. Proteome level analysis of different biological fluids has been found to be effective for investigation of disease pathobiology as well as identification of surrogate markers with diagnostic and prognostic significance [9], [10]. Recent proteomic studies have generated valuable information regarding the global/differential proteome and immunome profile of pathogenic Leptospira spp. [11], [12], [13], protein expression and multiple modification system of the pathogen [14], and analysis of leptospires excreted in urine of chronically infected hosts [15], [16]. To this end, notable achievements have been accomplished in deciphering the global and sub-cellular proteome profile of this pathogenic spirochete using quantitative mass spectrometric approaches [17], [18]. However, the molecular pathogenesis of leptospirosis is not clearly understood and requires further comprehensive studies at the molecular levels. The omics-based investigations can reveal the mechanism of disease pathogenesis and the pathogen induced alterations in host physiological system as well as identification of leptospiral immunogens useful for diagnostic applications and vaccine development.",

Identification of differentially expressed proteins was performed using high-sensitivity MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry. In this differential proteomics analysis, we have identified 22 statistically significant (p\n < 0.05) proteins in leptospirosis patients compared to the healthy subjects. Proteins showing differential expression in leptospirosis patients were subjected to further functional clustering by using database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) and protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER). The possible involvement of differentially expressed proteins in various physiological pathways and the host immune response against the pathogen has been studied. As far our knowledge goes, this is the first report of human serum proteome alterations in leptospiral infection and our results provide valuable insight into the host immune response against this acute bacterial infection and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease pathogenesis.",

Symptomatic patients with 2\u20134 days of fever and positive rapid immunodiagnostic test having no past history of autoimmune diseases or any significant systemic diseases were selected for this study. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical details, including past history of diseases of all patients (n = 6) selected for this proteomic study were recorded (Table S1.1). Blood specimens were also collected from age and sex matched healthy (n = 18) (voluntary blood donors) and febrile controls (n = 8) with written informed consent to perform comparative analysis. Patients with non-severe, uncomplicated, falciparum malaria diagnosed by microscopic examination and confirmed by rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) were selected as febrile controls (FC) for this proteomic study (Table S1.2). Serum separation tubes (BD Vacutainer\u00ae; BD Biosciences) were used to collect blood samples from the antecubital vein of the subjects. Subsequent to blood collection, samples were allowed to clot by keeping the tubes in ice for 30 min. After clotting, the samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm at 20 \u00b0C for 10 min to separate serum from the clotted blood. Collected serum samples were labeled and stored in multiple aliquots at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. To minimize any pre-analytical variations, exactly similar collection, processing and storage conditions were maintained for each control and diseased samples.",

A sub-set of 18 samples [6 each for leptospirosis (L), FC and HC] were analyzed individually by 2D-DIGE. Six representative subjects were selected from each group for 2D-DIGE analysis keeping the age range, median age value, sex, past history of systemic disease etc. in consideration. Sample processing for 2DE and 2D-DIGE were performed as previously described [19]. In brief, a combination of TCA-acetone protein precipitation, sonication, albumin and IgG depletion and desalting was used for processing serum samples from leptospirosis patients and controls for proteomic analysis. Depletion of albumin and IgG, and desalting of the serum samples were performed using Albumin & IgG Depletion SpinTrap (GE Healthcare) and 2D Clean-up kit (GE Healthcare), respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. After processing of protein extracts, the serum proteins were dissolved in rehydration buffer containing 8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 2% (v/v) IPG buffer (pH 4\u20137; Linear), 40 mM DTT and traces of bromophenol blue. Prior to the 2DE/2D-DIGE experiment protein concentration in each sample (leptospirosis patients and controls) was estimated using the 2D-Quant kit (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. The 600 \u03bcg of protein was loaded on 4\u20137 pH range, 18 cm IPG strips, and isoelectric focusing was performed for overall ~ 78 kVh using Ettan IPGphor 3 isoelectric focusing unit (GE Healthcare). The second dimension was performed on 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels in an Ettan DALTsix electrophoresis unit (GE Healthcare) and Gel Code Blue Safe Protein Stain (Thermo Scientific, USA) was used for the visualization of the protein spots. In order to test the reproducibility and reduce technical artifacts, every sample was analyzed in duplicate. In 2D-DIGE, test and control samples (leptospirosis patients and HC/FC) were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, while an equal amounts (total serum proteins) of all samples (L, FC and HC) to be analyzed in the experiment; regarded as internal standard was labeled using the third fluorescent dye, Cy2, following the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). While labeling of test and control samples, the dye swapping was performed to eliminate any type of dye effects. Subsequently, IEF and SDS-PAGE separation were performed following the same protocol as employed in the regular 2DE experiment.",

Both serum and plasma are components of blood; the liquid portion of blood is referred to as plasma, while removal of the fibrinogen and other clotting factors from plasma results in serum. Applications of serum and plasma as biological fluid for clinical research have their own advantages and limitations. Serum does not contain fibrinogen and other blood clotting factors and has a lesser total protein content compared to plasma, which reduces the unnecessary complexity to some extent making serum more ideal for disease diagnostic purposes. Very recently, Zimmerman et al. have performed a paired comparison of plasma and serum samples prepared from the same subjects and demonstrated negligible differences in the numbers of peptide and protein identifications or in the overall percentages of semi-tryptic peptides or methionine oxidized peptides between these two biological fluids indicating there is no significant difference between heparinized plasma and serum in terms of overall protein diversity except the depletion of fibrinogen in serum [24].",

Again, most of the previous proteomic studies have focused on the proteome and immunome profile of the pathogen [11], [17], [18], and very few studies have investigated the effect of leptospiral infection on host proteome. To this end, two recent studies have reported proteomic analysis of leptospires excreted in urine of chronically infected natural reservoir host Rattus norvegicus\n[15], [16], but, no proteome level analysis has been reported hitherto to describe alterations of human serum proteins and related biological pathways due to leptospiral infection.

Leptospirosis and malaria have overlapping geographical distributions and coexistence of these two pathogenic infections have been reported from different part of the world, particularly in the tropics [27], [28], [29], [30]. Although, these two infections have many similar clinical presentations, interestingly, quite a few serum proteins including complement C3 precursor, ceruloplasmin precursor, complement component C9, complement factor H and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 precursor exhibited altered expression levels in leptospirosis patients, but not in falciparum malaria (febrile controls) (Table S5; Fig. S3). Again, few proteins like complement factor B precursor, Ig kappa chain C region, Ig mu chain C region found to exhibit opposite trend of differential expression between leptospirosis and falciparum malaria compared to the healthy controls.

Inflammation-induced coagulation activation leading to thrombocytopenia is a consistently detectable phenomenon in infectious diseases and reported in the context of falciparum malaria [35] and dengue virus infection [36] earlier. Bleeding tendency in leptospirosis may arise due to an imbalance in the hemostatic equilibrium and toxic effect exerted by the pathogen on bone marrow leads to thrombocytopenia [37], [38].

            "text": "Another interesting finding is the modulation of complement pathways, alternative and lectin, in this zoonotic infectious disease (Fig. S6). After being activated by innate immunity system of the host, the complement cascade plays an important role in recognition and destruction of invading pathogens. Previous studies have also shown the activation of complement system's lectin pathway through elevated serum levels of mannose-binding lectin, which exhibit sound correlation with the severity of clinical signs of leptospirosis [39]. In order to survive within host cells and escape the defense system, pathogenic microorganisms adapt versatile mechanisms including inhibition of complement cascades [40]. In this proteomic analysis we have identified down-regulation of few complement factors, including complement C3 precursor (2.21-fold), complement C4 precursor (1.89-fold) and some complement regulatory proteins like clusterin (2.16-fold) in the leptospirosis patients (Table 2). In leptospiral infection, soluble complement regulator factor H prevents complement activation at the C3 stage by inhibiting the C3-convertase and inactivating C3b into iC3b [41]. To get rid of clearance and destruction by host complement system virulent pathogens sometimes acquire fluid-phase regulators of complement pathways such as factor H and C4b-binding protein (C4BP) on the cellular surface [42], [43]. Previous studies have demonstrated immune evasion of leptospira species by acquisition of human complement regulator factor H, factor H-related protein 1 (FHR-1) and C4BP [41], [44], [45]. Decreased expression level of complement factors and regulatory proteins might be a consequence of the leptospiral infection and probably through the deposition of complement inhibition molecules on the pathogen cell surface or by some other unknown mechanisms performed by this pathogenic spirochete after invasion. Detailed investigation of functional aspects of complement factors and regulatory proteins might provide interesting insights about the disease pathogenesis and aid in identification of potential therapeutic targets.",

            "text": "Although, leptospiral infection in human generally remains at a subclinical level or results in mild self-limiting systemic illness, but, it may cause severe infection with life-threatening complications like septic shock, multi-organ failure and lethal pulmonary hemorrhages leading to mortality if not diagnosed and treated timely. In the developing countries, lack of awareness of the disease and inaccessibility of appropriate laboratory diagnostic facilities are the major causes behind the rapid transmission and motility associated with this vector-borne infectious disease [46]. Diagnosis of leptospirosis generally performed through the detection of IgM antibodies against the pathogen by rapid screening tests [47]. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and ELISA-based immunoassays are the most common approaches for diagnosis of this acute bacterial infection and carried out at different health facilities. Since serological tests become positive only after one week, hematology and urine analysis is also executed to identify different physiological abnormalities such as increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, breathlessness, bleeding tendencies, proteinuria, hematuria, thrombocytopenia, elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine phosphokinase, SGOT and SGPT etc. that can be utilized as the indicators of leptospiral infection [48], [49]. Misdiagnosis of leptospirosis sometime occurs due to its broad spectrum of symptoms, which may mimic the clinical signs of many related infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, hantavirus infection and malaria [23]. Moreover, mixed infections with malaria or dengue along with leptospirosis also create complications and difficulties for diagnosis process. Establishment of a panel of serological markers that can confirm leptospiral infection with high accuracy and efficiently discriminate it from other related infectious diseases will be extremely precious from the diagnostic points of view. While, the major emphasis of the study was to provide better insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease pathogenesis and host immune response in leptospirosis, but, one of the possible outcomes of this study could be establishment of early detection surrogates for the disease to meet the need for better diagnostics and effective therapy. Among the identified differentially expressed serum proteins, apolipoprotein A-I, clusterin, \u03b1-1B-glycoprotein precursor, vitronectin precursor, and \u03b1-1B-glycoprotein precursor could further be investigated as inflammation-related biomarkers of leptospiral infection.",

Comprehensive proteomic analysis using classical 2DE and 2D-DIGE in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS revealed differential expression of several serum proteins in leptospirosis patients compared to healthy individuals. Our results suggest that identified proteins are associated with various essential physiological processes and biological functions. Further investigation of functional properties of proteins identified in this study is likely to elucidate better understanding of disease pathobiology and may help to establish candidate surrogate markers proteins for detection of leptospiral infection and discrimination from other related infectious diseases.",
