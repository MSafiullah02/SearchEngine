Peripheral blood, nasal, and throat swab samples were collected from subjects during the initial enrollment and at the time of AE-COPD. COPD exacerbation was defined as a respiratory illness marked by the presence of symptoms of rhinitis or pharyngitis and increased cough, shortness of breath, or sputum production and/or change in sputum color in the presence or absence of fever (temperature >37.7 \u00b0C).4 Subjects underwent bronchoscopy when clinically stable; alternatively, patients admitted to the Ben Taub General Hospital with a diagnosis of AE-COPD and started on ventilator support underwent bronchoscopy with alveolar fluid lavage sampling, as we have described previously.5 All studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Baylor College of Medicine, and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.",

Therefore we determined the viral causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections prospectively in the volunteers participating in the LES-COPD study. We collected nasal and throat swab samples from our volunteers during initial enrollment and at the time of AE-COPD (see the Methods section for the definition of AE-COPD). Respiratory tract viral infections were identified by using a high-throughput, multiplex-based assay that simultaneously identifies up to 17 respiratory viruses and subtypes (MultiCode-Plx, Eragen Biosciences). A total of 45 illness episodes in a 24-month period (including a few during which the subject was not seen during the acute illness) were identified. We found that, as is consistent with the observations of others and our prior observations,4 a majority of exacerbations occurred in those with more advanced COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] class III-IV; 29 cases) compared with subjects with mild COPD (GOLD class I-II; 10 cases) or no disease (control subjects; 6 cases). Samples from volunteers at baseline (at the time of entry into LES-COPD) did not yield PCR evidence of viral infection. In contrast, 13 (29%) of 45 samples collected during the return visit for AE-COPD were PCR positive for viruses, the majority of which (10/13; 77%) were rhinovirus (see Table E2 available in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).

In contrast to findings from peripheral lung lymphocytes studied in vitro, we found that more than half of the subjects in each group had no detectable IFN-\u03b3 in their BAL fluid. Although higher concentrations of this cytokine were detected in subjects with AE-COPD, it did not reach statistical significance (Fig 1, A). Similarly, no differences in the concentration of IL-13 in BAL fluid were found (Fig 1, B). However, we detected significantly higher concentrations of IL-4, the canonical TH2 cytokine, in the BAL fluid of subjects with AE-COPD, whereas very few subjects in the other groups produced this cytokine (Fig 1, C).",

In agreement with the TH2 cytokine findings from BAL fluid analyses of patients with AE-COPD, PBMC-derived CD4 T cells during AE-COPD in patients with COPD class III to IV secreted significantly higher amounts of IL-13 when compared with levels seen in the same group during stable periods (Fig 2, C; P = .04). We could not detect expression of IL-4 in any of our in vitro coculture conditions, indicating the extremely low concentration of this cytokine under physiological conditions.

Therefore to confirm that HRV proteinases 2A and 3C could induce TH1 immune responses, TH2 immune responses, or both in vivo, we administered OVA PBS, OVA vehicle, or proteinases and OVA (OVA was used to ensure detection of antigen-specific IgG1, a marker of TH2 immunity) to mice over a 3-week period by using a well-established model of active proteinase-induced allergic lung disease.11, 24 Proteinases were delivered intranasally to mimic conditions likely to be present during active HRV upper respiratory tract infection (Fig 5, A\n). Compared with OVA or vehicle challenge, intranasal challenge with proteinases 2A and 3C resulted in airway hyperreactivity, as assessed by both an increase in respiratory system resistance in response to multiple acetylcholine doses and a decrease in the PC200 (Fig 5, B-D, and data not shown). Rhinovirus proteinase 2A further induced more robust lung inflammation, as assessed by both enhanced eosinophilia and neutrophilia. Whole-lung single-cell analysis with the ELISpot technique also showed predominant spontaneous IL-4 production from mice challenged with rhinovirus proteinase 2A when compared with the other treatment groups (Fig 5, C and D). Interestingly, despite the more robust TH2 response to proteinase 2A, the B-cell response, as determined by means of detection of OVA-specific IgG1, was present in mice treated with proteinases 2A and 3C (Fig 5, E).

            "text": "Our finding that rhinoviral proteinases could powerfully induce TH1 and TH2 inflammation thus provides potentially critical insight into the pathogenesis of both COPD exacerbation and rhinovirus infections. It is interesting to note that although we found an increase in IL-13 production during AE-COPD specifically in subjects with severe and very severe COPD (GOLD class III-IV), we found that IL-10, a cytokine that is generally inhibitory to both TH1 and TH2 immune responses, is also upregulated in patients with AE-COPD, irrespective of disease severity. The increase in IL-10 levels during acute inflammation/infection might represent a natural regulatory response to limit T-cell activation after the initial viral infection. Nonetheless, by inducing lower respiratory tract type 2 immune responses, rhinoviral proteinases likely induce a second component of airway obstruction mediated not through loss of lung structural integrity but through the pro-obstructive effects of IL-4, IL-13, or both (ie, airway hyperresponsiveness and airway mucus hypersecretion).35, 36 Moreover, HRVs likely gain from the immune deviation catalyzed by their proteinases. As in asthma, the type 2 immunity induced by viral proteinases might impair otherwise efficient type 1 immune clearance mechanisms, leading to prolonged infection and enhanced spread of the micro-organism. Although this point is speculative, we propose that accelerated production of proteinase 2A might have evolved as a strategy not to enhance the processing of polyproteins because interference leads to a decrease in viral titer37; however, modulation of the host immune response, which can be maximal at much lower levels of proteinase production, could promote disease dissemination. Although this putative virally adaptive mechanism is of little consequence to hosts with normal respiratory function, it can unfortunately be perilous to those with severe COPD with respiratory compromise.",

Specifically, systemic or topical corticosteroids might suppress production of IL-4 and IL-13, thereby alleviating the airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus hyperproduction that are induced by these cytokines.35 Although further studies are required, corticosteroids can potentially promote elimination of respiratory viruses by inhibiting the aberrant allergic immune response to secreted viral proteinases.",

Nonetheless, our findings further support the contention that proteinases are crucial virulence factors for allergic disease elicited by diverse organisms.24, 39, 41 Superimposition of allergic inflammation on pre-existing TH1-based disease might be expected to compound airway obstruction through multiple nonredundant mechanisms, thereby leading to clinical deterioration.
