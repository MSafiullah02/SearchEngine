Specifically, we develop a generalized propensity score-based estimator that allows us to estimate both direct and spillover effects of a continuous treatment, which spreads through weighted and directed edges of a network. To showcase this methodology, we investigate whether and how spillover effects shape the optimal level of policy interventions in agricultural markets. Our results show that, in this context, neglecting interference may lead to a downward bias when assessing policy effectiveness.",

In these cases, the existing impact evaluation methodologies (e.g., the propensity score matching (PSM), Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983; Dehejia et al., 2002) , which rely on the assumption that an agent's treatment does not spill over on to other agents, 3 largely neglect the existence of interference.",

The latter is the agent's exposure to the treatments of neighborhood agents. Causal estimation of these effects is then obtained by balancing individual and network characteristics across agents under different levels of the individual and network treatments. The foundation of this approach rests upon the work by Forastiere et al. (2020) , who were among the first to tackle the issue of interference in observational network data and causal inference. With respect to that study, a key novelty of this paper is represented by the source of treatment considered. While Forastiere et al. (2020) proposes a method to study binary treatments, here we consider a continuous treatment at both individual and network level. Moreover, our method allows to model different degree of exposures to spillover effects, by considering both symmetric or asymmetric network connections, and those characterized by heterogeneous intensities.",

Policy interventions in these markets provide an ideal case-study for the analysis interference for two main reasons. First, these interventions are not randomly distributed, leading to a potential treatment selection bias. Second, they can significantly interfere with one another because of the emerging interconnections of the agri-food international networks (Johnson & Noguera, 2017; Bali\u00e9 et al., 2018) . In this context, our method allows to assess the impact of a policy while correcting for potential biases resulting from both treatment selection and interference. In addition, it allows to model the non-discrete nature of the treatment, accounting for the heterogeneous intensity of policy interventions, which differ from country to country and over time. The potential spillover effects of national policies in agricultural markets have represented a matter of interest for academics and policy makers since the 2008 food crisis, when riots erupted in many developing countries, and it is currently highly debated during the COVID-19 crisis, as some countries are resorting to restrict their exports in order to ensure adequate domestic supplies. 5 Contributing to this emerging debate, we show that agricultural policies have indirect effects which significantly interfere with those implemented by commercial partners.",

In impact evaluation methods, it is standard to assume that agent's potential outcome (i.e., Y i ) depends only on the agent's own treatment; that is, the individual treatment Z. This assumption, combined with the unique treatment assumption, is referred to as the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) (Rubin, 1980) . However, under interference, SUTVA does not hold, since agents are also exposed to the treatment received by their neighborhood; that is, the neighborhood treatment G i . Formally, this violation of the SUTVA requires the introduction of a new more general assumption, which takes into account interference within the neighborhood. Accordingly, in what follows, we propose some adjustments to the main elements constituting the SUTVA.",

The use of our (generalized) propensity score-based estimator to this context is justified by two main reasons. First, policy interventions in these markets are not random; rather, they are driven by a series of macro-economic factors such as the country's level of development and agroclimatic conditions, among others. In such cases, our method allows us to assess the impact of a policy while correcting for potential biases resulting from both treatment selection and interference. Second, the intensity of policy interventions is highly heterogeneous -differing from country to country and over time -and our framework provides the means to model the non-discrete nature of this treatment.",

Figure 1 shows that while the richest countries are decreasing their policy support to farmers, developing countries are increasingly switching from taxing agricultural production to applying protectionist measures, often exceeding the level of support provided by OECD countries (Swinnen et al., 2012) . The characteristics selected to explain the policy intensity (i.e., set ii ) are borrowed from the agricultural and trade policy literature (Anderson et al., 2013; Magrini et al., 2017) . Specifically, we consider: real per capita GDP and total population as a proxy of the country demand and size, respectively; per-capita arable land and the agricultural total factor productivity growth index to assess the country's relative agricultural comparative advantage; the ratio of food imports to total exports, net food exports, and absolute (positive and negative) percentage deviations from the trend in international food prices as a measure of country's access to, dependence from, and position in the global market; and the international food price volatility index to capture country's response to changes in price levels. Finally, we include a dummy to capture the effect of the food crisis of 2007-08, and a set of regional dummies to control for unobservable characteristics of African, Asian, European-transition, Latin American, and high-income countries.",

Nonetheless, a number of relevant insights can be obtained by the analysis of the estimated parameters presented in this table. Take for instance column 1, which indicates the correlation between the intensity of direct policy interventions and pre-treatment country characteristics. A country is more likely to strengthen the support to its agricultural sector when the local demand expands, due to an increase in per capita GDP or in the population. In contrast, a country tends to increase the taxation of revenues when it has a comparative advantage in the agricultural sector, as measured by per capita arable land, or when it heavily relies on imports, as proxied by the variables food import over total exports and net food exports. This also happens when positive and negative deviations of international prices from their trend and high level of food price volatility occur, suggesting that when prices spike, governments tend to reduce the support to their domestic markets by imposing restrictions on exports and lowering protection on imports. This is also confirmed by the negative and significant coefficient on food crisis. Now consider column 2, which describes instead the correlation between the country i characteristics and the (weighted average) intensity of policies implemented by its commercial partners. We observe that partner countries tend to provide a high support to their own agricultural sector when the country i features a large local demand or it increases its reliance on imports. In contrast, they reduce the level of support when trading with partners who experience price volatility. Finally, we observe that the direct NAC is negatively correlated with the network NAC, which suggests that, country characteristics being held constant, the higher the level of support in the country i the lower will be that of partner countries.",

While in the previous analysis we made use of only the former type of covariates, in this section we introduce a specific networklevel variable, namely the weighted average real per capita GDP of the network N i .Table B.6 in Appendix B reports the estimated parameters of the models for the individual and the neighborhood treatments when including this additional covariate. The results are in line with our baseline specification and further show that network real per capita GDP is negatively correlated with the direct NAC and positively associated with the network NAC. 22 Moreover, we find that the outcome model still confirms our main results(Table B.7, Appendix B), although with wider confidence intervals for both aDRFs and a lower maximum point for\u00b5 G (z) (1.61) (Figure B.7). Further, we check whether our results are robust to sample composition. First, we re-run our baseline model excluding the main global exporters and importers, namely the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, China, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the UK, to check whether these are indeed the countries more responsible for spillover effects. As expected, the results reported in Tables B.8, B.9 in Appendix B and in Figure B.8 show no point of maximum in the considered NAC range and a no longer increasing aDRF of the network NAC \u00b5 G (g) (right-hand panel). This corroborates our main findings, whereby agricultural policies implemented by large global players have a strong influence over the food security of their trade partners and, accordingly, cannot be ignored when assessing the effectiveness of policies.Finally, we make use of an alternative proxy for food security, i.e. food utilization. Measured as the prevalence of anemia among children aged under five, consumers are better off when this measure is minimized.Table B.2 in Appendix B reports the coefficients of the four outcome models so far analyzed. A low level of intervention (i.e., when NAC is about 1.4) is still conducive of high consumer welfare (Figure B.9). But again this optimal level of support is underestimated when considering interference, as the minimum point moves from 1.4 to 1.6 (Figure B.10). Similar results are also obtained when we introduce the neighborhood-level characteristic, and when excluding top global exporters and importers from the analysis, as reported inFigure B.12 andFigure B.13, respectively.",
