DENV is the etiologic agent for an estimated 390 million human infections (Bhatt et al., 2013), 96 million of which show disease manifestations ranging from an acute self-limiting febrile illness to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (Simmons et al., 2012).

            "text": "The innate immune response provides the first line of defense against virus infection, as the host activates multiple signaling pathways in the minutes and hours after infection in its attempts to limit virus replication and dissemination. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) play a crucial role in this early phase of antiviral response as they serve both as detectors of virus infection and triggers of the innate immune response. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 7, and cytoplasmic RNA sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), are the crucial PRRs against RNA virus infection. These sensors recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and 5\u2032-triphosphate single-stranded RNA, and trigger the activation of innate immune response (Kumar, Kawai, and Akira, 2011). In particular, RIG-I and MDA5 are the primary sensors for foreign RNA in the cytoplasm. While RIG-I and MDA5 are ubiquitously expressed at low basal levels, their expression levels are rapidly up-regulated in response to type I IFN. Both sensors are activated by dsRNA, with RIG-I having preferential binding to short dsRNAs with a 5\u2032-triphosphate group, and MDA5 recognizing longer dsRNA molecules. Activation of either of these sensors triggers their binding to and activation of MAVS via their CARD domains, setting off a cascade of signaling activity beginning with activation of IRF3/7 and NF-\u03baB transcription factors, the production of type I interferon (IFN) and subsequent downstream activation of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) (Kawai et al., 2005, Kumar et al., 2011, Onoguchi et al., 2010). This activation of ISGs plays an important role in the host antiviral response.",

            "text": "The DENV NS5 protein has multiple enzymatic functions as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for genome replication (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001) and methyltransferase (MTase) responsible for 5\u2032 RNA cap formation and methylation (Egloff et al., 2002, Ray et al., 2006). In addition, flavivirus methyltransferases have 2\u2032-O-methylation activity on internal adenosines (Dong et al., 2012). 2\u2032-O-methylation of the 5\u2032 RNA cap is crucial for evasion of host immune responses for multiple viruses (Dong et al., 2014), although a loss of 2\u2032-O-methylation activity has varying effects in different viruses. WNV defective in 2\u2032-O-methylation activity is attenuated in cells with a fully functional type I IFN response and sensitive to inhibition by IFN-induced proteins with tetra-tricopeptide repeats (IFIT) proteins, but interestingly induces comparable levels of type I IFN to wild-type WNV (Daffis et al., 2010). In contrast, coronaviruses (CoV) defective in 2\u2032-O-methylation are also attenuated in cells with a fully functional type I IFN response and highly sensitive to inhibition by type I IFN but induces higher expression of type I IFN (Zust et al., 2011). This observed attenuation of the various 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant viruses prompted us to hypothesize that they could be potential vaccine candidates (Zhou et al., 2007). Indeed, we and others have found that DENV, JEV and CoV defective in 2\u2032-O-MTase activity are attenuated in cells with a fully functional type I IFN response, and induced strong antiviral and antibody responses in monkey and mouse models (Li et al., 2013, Menachery et al., 2014, Zust et al., 2013). These studies have shown that the type I IFN response, and especially paracrine IFN signaling (Schmid et al., 2015), plays an important role in the animals\u2019 antiviral response to infection. But the exact mechanisms of this DENV attenuation and immune protection have not been fully characterized. In this study, we aim to expand on our understanding of this attenuation of DENV by the loss of its 2\u2032-O-MTase activity.",

Equal amounts (10 \u03bcg) of WT and 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant full length genomic RNA were electroporated into BHK-21 cells, which do not produce type I IFN (Sellers et al., 1968). DENV replication was detected by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of DENV E protein expression for five days post-transfection (\nFig. 1A). Over the five-day time course, classic foci formation was observed, indicating progressive viral replication, secretion, and spread. However, the percentage of E protein-positive cells was significantly lower from the very first time point (day 1 post-transfection) when electroporated with the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV RNA compared to WT DENV RNA (Fig. 1A and B). This trend was maintained until day 5 post-transfection. As the percentage of E protein-positive WT RNA-transfected cells plateaued, the percentage of E protein-positive 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant RNA-transfected cells reached statistically similar levels as the percentage of E protein-positive WT RNA-transfected cells on day 5 post-transfection (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that the replication rate of 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV is already attenuated early during infection in BHK-21 cells.",

Comparison of the various virus growth curves revealed several notable observations. Firstly, replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV was already lagging behind WT DENV replication by 1-log from the first time point on day 1 post-infection in both Vero and A549 cells (Fig. 1C). This was in agreement with the virus growth kinetics in BHK-21 cells seen by IFA. In addition, the virus titers for each virus were statistically similar (p>0.05) in the two cell lines at 24 h post-infection, suggesting that replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV is highly attenuated during the first 24 h post-infection regardless of the IFN-producing status of the infected cells. As virus replication progressed beyond the first 24 h, virus titers increased before beginning to plateau around two days post-infection in all cases. Here, we detected differences in plateaued virus titers between the two cell lines. In Vero cells, the viral titers for both viruses plateaued at statistically similar levels (p>0.05). In contrast, the viral titer of WT DENV was significantly higher than 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV (p<0.05) in A549 cells. These trends are consistent with previous findings, and suggest that a fully functional type I IFN response plays a role in controlling the replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV during the later stages of infection.",

The gene expression patterns for the mock and heat-inactivated WT DENV were highly similar, indicating that the heat-inactivated WT DENV had little effect on gene expression (\nFig. 3A).

The qPCR analysis revealed gene expression patterns similar to those observed in our microarray study for the time points 12 and 24 h post-infection, hence validating our microarray analysis (\nFig. 4A and B). In contrast, an examination of the gene expression during the very early phase of infection (first 12 h post-infection) revealed a completely different pattern for a subset of these genes. We found that infection with 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV triggered an earlier transcriptional response in A549 cells, as compared to infection with WT DENV, in this subset of genes including DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (MDA5), ISG15, IL8 (CXCL8), IFIT2, NFKB2, IRF1 and IRF7 (Fig. 4C). Most of these genes, including the three PRRs (DDX58, IFIH1 and IFIT2), were significantly up-regulated in A549 cells infected with 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV compared with other three infection conditions (WT DENV, heat-inactivated WT DENV or mock infection) during the first 2\u201310 h post-infection. In fact, the mRNA levels of the three PRRs rose above basal levels as early as 2 h post-infection and stayed above basal levels throughout the first 24 h of infection. Infection with the WT virus revealed a vastly different trend of PRRs expression, as expression levels remained at basal levels during the first 10\u201312 h of infection before increasing significantly (Fig. 4).

The presence of a properly methylated 5\u2032 cap on the virus genomic RNA is crucial for their ability to evade host immune responses (Dong et al., 2014). Flaviviruses and coronaviruses defective in 2\u2032-O-methylation activity are attenuated in IFN-competent cells, and are inhibited by IFN-induced proteins with tetra-tricopeptide repeats (IFIT) (Li et al., 2013, Menachery et al., 2014, Szretter et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2007, Zust et al., 2011). In light of these studies, it has been proposed that 2\u2032-O-methylation of the virus RNA genome enables it to mimic cellular mRNA and evade immediate detection by the host PRRs (Dong et al., 2014). Hence the loss of this 5\u2032 cap structure could disrupt the virus's ability to successfully establish an infection by triggering an early innate immune response.",

IFIT1 has been shown to modulate the sensitivity of 2\u2032-O-methylation (Daffis et al., 2010), and replication of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant WNV is rescued in IFIT1 knockout cells (Szretter et al., 2012). In particular, IFIT1 has a higher affinity for non-2\u2032-O-methylated RNA than 2\u2032-O-methylated RNA, and inhibits translation of the bound RNA (Habjan et al., 2013, Kimura et al., 2013). The successful induction of the type I IFN response and subsequent increase in IFIT1 expression could account for why the peak viral titer of the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV never catches up to WT DENV in IFN-producing cells.",

While the latter attenuation is dependent on the type I IFN response, we show that the early attenuation coincides with the induction of a strong early innate immune response. Hence 2\u2032-O-methylation of the 5\u2032 cap of the genomic RNA is an essential element for dengue virus to evade early innate immune activation by the host as the virus seeks to establish infection. This phenomenon highlights the importance of host responses in controlling the early stages of DENV infection and suggests that DENV employs mechanisms of immune evasion that target multiple phases of infection. Such a strong early innate immune response is crucial for the subsequent activation of T and B cell responses (Zust et al., 2013), which are important criteria in vaccine development. We thus suggest that this model virus may pose an asset in vaccine development with the heightened and immediate immune response from the host. This functional mutation may be combined with other specific viral mutations in the development of a rational approach for live-attenuated dengue vaccines.",
