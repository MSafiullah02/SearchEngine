            "text": "We propose, develop, and operate an infectious disease outbreak information system, called PEACOCK, that is accurate, fast (real-time information from web big data, such as online news and portal search queries), user-friendly (map-based), and visual (combination and comparison of various types of infectious disease outbreak information). Our system provides the following three types of useful infectious disease outbreak information.\n\u2022PEACOCK provides the number of infected people per district on a map based on Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) data. It presents four types of infection indices and the fractions of infected people relative to population, district, and time. It also compares the number of infected people in the current month with that in the previous month and visualizes the status of the district in terms of the increase in infectious disease using a colored classification. In addition, it provides the number of infected people by district in a bar graph form.\u2022PEACOCK provides infectious disease information based on online news. Online news has been collected since August 2017. It provides the top-five most frequently mentioned infectious diseases in the collected news. It also provides news articles and detailed information related to the infectious disease searched for by users. In addition, it displays the number of news articles related to the diseases per district on the map. A higher number of news articles indicates a larger outbreak of infectious disease.\u2022PEACOCK generates and provides the infection risk level of the searched infectious disease per district on a map by combining two types of infectious disease information: the number of online news articles and the number of portal search queries. In addition, it provides graphs that compare infectious disease outbreak statistics and web data statistics in terms of number, fraction, and difference. It also provides a graph that shows the similarity of disease outbreak statistics to web data statistics. Finally, it presents a graph that shows the match between the systems infection risk values with actual disease outbreak statistics. Consequently, users can visually identify area susceptible to the disease of interest up to one month in advance. They also figure out the accuracy of our system.",

The system collects the Mexican population data through the National Statistics Office and weather data, such as temperature, from the Mexican Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources, and it shows the information in graph and map forms. Another system [15] provides influenza outbreak information for China. The system collects official data reported by China\u2019s Ministry of Health and provides influenza outbreak information by comparing the collected data with data predicted by the system. Another system [16] provides malaria outbreak information for Thailand based on the data from the official website of the WHO from 2005 to 2009. The system shows similarities between the outbreak data and its own predicted data.",

EpiSPIDER [18] extracts infectious disease outbreak information, such as keywords and dates, related to diseases among data collected from online news articles. It displays the data on the map using colors based on the elapsed date. It also shows the trend of each disease for three years in a bar graph form. The Medical Information System [19], [20] retrieves online news articles about the disease and displays them according to the user\u2019s search. Based on the number of articles, the system shows the most-common illnesses for each district in a chart form. The user can receive the search result via SMS or e-mail. HealthMap [21], [22] is one of the systems that provide disease outbreak information on a map. The system collects the disease outbreak information in real time from online news articles and processes them as necessary information; it then uses that information to visualize the risk level on the map. Another system [23] provides news media information using HealthMap. It provides the dengue fever outbreak information of Sri Lanka from 2007 to 2015. The system collects online news articles using keywords of both Sri Lanka and dengue-fever-related disease from the HealthMap database, and the number of times that a certain keyword is mentioned in news articles is shown on hourly and monthly graphs. The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases Mail [24]\u2013[26] analyzes and extracts online news articles and provides disease outbreak information via the web or e-mail by dividing the risk levels into colors based on the analysis results.",

It also compares those prediction results with actual CDC data. Google Dengue Trends uses Google search query data to provide dengue outbreak information in a similar way to Google Flu Trends. It provides disease outbreak information based on anonymous Google search query logs of Mexico in real time, and it shows the risk level in colors on the map. It also compares the prediction results with actual CDC data. A system [16] that shows the risk-level information for malaria in Thailand uses Google search query data and Google Correlate, an open-source search tool. It collects search query data using malaria-related keywords and extracts time-series data obtained using these search keywords. It generates and provides malaria outbreak information to Thai medical practitioners. A system that provides influenza outbreak information for China [30] collects search query data from Baidu, a representative Chinese search engine. In particular, the system uses Baidu\u2019s keyword tool to extract relevant keywords for flu, and users can visualize the results in graph and table forms. The system reported in another study [31] uses search query data from UpToDate, a specialized database in which practitioners upload medical activity. It uses UpToDate to collect search keywords related to influenza-like illness, displays the search ratio of each keyword in bar graph form, and analyzes the ratio to predict influenza outbreaks.",

The system provides a form for users to carry out a search by selecting the year, month, district, infectious disease name, and infectious disease outbreak information type. After a user selects items on this search form and submits a request, the request is sent to the web server. First, when the user searches for the number of infected people, the client side calculates the infection indices using input data, the number of infected people, the population of the district, and the number of infected people during the past month. TABLE 2 shows the notation meanings and formulas of infection indices. Once the infection indices are calculated, the client side displays the information on the map. The Naver Map API is used for map implementation. If the user searches the district through the interface, the client-side receives the latitude and longitude data of the district stored in the database from the server, which is displayed in the map. The map is visualized in blue to specify a decreasing monthly infection index, green for no change, and red for an increase. The infectious disease outbreak rankings with the number of infected people are shown by district using a bar chart. The chart is obtained using Chart.js [45], an open-source library that provides various functions for drawing charts. Second, if the user searches for news information, the client side displays the number of news articles by district on the map. It also displays news articles in a table format. In addition, the client-side also shows the five most mentioned infectious diseases in a block form. The client side finally shows the risk level on the map based on the number of infected people, the number of news articles, and the number of search queries. It shows the risk level on the map by combining the aforementioned infection indices, infected-people percentage, news article percentage, and search query percentage. It displays the number of infected people, the number of news articles, and the number of search queries by month through a line chart using Chart.js. It also shows the relative percentages of these parameters so that the user can more easily understand their similarities. The client then calculates the risk level using the relative percentages as follows. TABLE 2 provides the notation meanings and formulas for risk-level calculations. The client side divides the risk into three levels based on the value. If the risk is more than 70% (Risk >70%), red color is used. If it exceeds 50% (Risk >50%), yellow is used. Red represents danger, yellow represents attention, and blue means normal.",

According to the user input, a query fetches the number of news articles mentioned and the news data from the database. It then returns the results received from the database to the client through JSON [47]. When the user retrieves the risk-level information, the server retrieves these three types of information and delivers them to the client. The number of infected persons and the number of news referrals are taken from each table in the database, and search trend data are obtained by entering keywords into the Naver search trend platform.

Fig. 7 compares the infected people percentage with the news article percentage of Scrub typhus from January to June 2018, where the trend of the news article percentage is different from that of the infected people percentage. This is because the news contains intentional information, such as advertisements [50]\u2013[52]. The bar figure has many large bars, which indicates a large difference. Fig. 8 compares the infection percentage with the news article percentage of hepatitis C from January to June 2018. Unlike the trend of Scrub typhus in Fig. 7, except for January, hepatitis C shows a similar trend. The bar figure has few large bars, which indicates similarity. Thus, the news query percentage is sometimes similar to the infection percentage, so it can be used to estimate the infected people percentage.\n\n",

The recent spread of mobile devices has increased the importance of infectious-disease outbreak information systems that aggregate data related to these diseases and provide outbreak information to users accurately and quickly. In this work, a map-based multitype infectious disease outbreak information system was presented that provides information based on the number of infected people, information based on online news, and risk-level information by combining the number of infected people, news items, and search queries. The system depicts the information using maps and various figures, and users can pinpoint the information easily. The system presents various and necessary types of disease information separately, in combination and in comparison. The system will help people monitor and prevent infectious diseases by providing them with necessary infectious disease outbreak information accurately, quickly, and visually through a user-friendly interface. The system is currently available on the web at http://www.epidemic.co.kr/map.",

Most related works have analyzed web data for single or few diseases. We analyze web data for as many diseases as possible and try to reveal their patterns of similarities. Second, we find efficient keywords for web data collection using artificial intelligence technologies. Our system collects news and search queries by simply using names for specific diseases. We can find words related to specific diseases using Word2Vec techniques [53], [54]; as a result, we can use them as keywords for the data collection to gather more relevant web data. Third, our final goal is to provide accurate prediction information for infectious disease outbreaks. We develop general prediction models that can be applied to as many diseases as possible rather than specific diseases. Because the characteristics of the diseases are different from each other, it is difficult to create a general model. We classify the infectious diseases and develop models for each disease group. We then apply the models to our system and provide the user with accurate prediction information of infectious disease outbreaks. We believe that our system will provide not only actual infectious disease outbreak information and various related web data statistics but also predictions of infectious disease outbreak in the near future.",
