            "text": "John Donne, Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions (1) I n mid-December 2019, Chinese physicians working in Wuhan, a port city of 11 million people in the central province of Hubei, reported several cases of an undisclosed pneumonia. Using a surveillance mechanism that was established following the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the initial 4 reported cases of \"pneumonia of unknown etiology\" were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which consequently was shut down on January 1, 2020. Based on the results of deep sequencing and investigations by 5 independent laboratories, Chinese officials reported on January 7, 2020, that the causative agent of the mystery pneumonia was a novel coronavirus (nCoV). Sequence analysis revealed that the 2019-nCoV possesses a typical genome structure of coronavirus belonging to the cluster of betacoronaviruses that includes Bat-SARS-like (SL)-ZC45, Bat-SL ZXC21, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV. Based on the genomic content of coronavirus disease viruses, 2019-nCov appears to be more closely related to bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and bat-SL-CoV ZXC2, and more distantly related to SARS-CoV (2). On January 11, 2020, China reported the first death from nCoV in a 61-year-old man who purchased goods from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. In the weeks that followed, the coronavirus outbreak spread across China, slithering into neighboring countries and continents. By January 13, the World Health Organization reported a case of 2019-nCoV in a woman in Thailand, who had arrived from Wuhan. Thus began what we now recognize as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. How the 2019-nCoV spread from a seafood market to become a worldwide pandemic that collapsed economies worldwide within a matter of months will continue to be the grist for the medical, economic, and political mills, now and for the foreseeable future. Certainly, there is plenty of blame to go around, beginning with the early handling of the outbreak by Chinese officials, as well as the agonizingly slow roll out of nCoV testing in the United States. Notwithstanding the reflexive finger-pointing and blame-gaming, there is an inspiring backstory of human sacrifice, heroism, and courage on the part of the health care workers in China, who were grappling with treating patients with SARS flu-like symptoms, but without any specific knowledge about the virulence or pathogenicity of the disease they were treating. Moreover, the frontline Chinese health care workers were providing care without proper personal protective equipment to shield them from harm. In a sobering article in the Los Angeles Times titled \"Doctors and Nurses Fighting Coronavirus in China Die of Both Infection and Fatigue\" (3), Alice Su reports that there were \"18 reported deaths of medical workers involved in the COVID-19 response as of Monday [February 24, 2020], including nurses and doctors who died not because of infection but because of cardiac arrest or other ailments due to overwork and fatigue. One victim was hit by a car while taking temperatures on a highway.\" The article also mentions Dr. Peng Yinhua (age 29), who postponed his planned wedding on February 1, so that he could continue to provide care to COVID-19 patients. Dr. Yinhua promised his pregnant fianc\u00e9e that they would have a ceremony after the outbreak had passed: he died of COVID-19 on February 21. In his epic work Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, John Donne argues that the death of any individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly",
