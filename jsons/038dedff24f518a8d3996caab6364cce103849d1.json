In fact, the healthy human body always contains a large number of foreign cells and viruses (Virgin et al., 2009; Dethlefsen et al., 2007; Relman, 2002) . There are more viral particles in the human body than microbial cells, which are ten times more numerous than eukaryotic (human) cells. Similarly, only about 1.5% of the human genome encodes recognizable \"human proteins,\" whereas approximately 45% our genome is retrotransposons, DNA transposons, and viral sequences. Most of the human-associated microbes and viruses, often found on \"external\" surfaces lining the lumens of organs such as the gut and oral/nasal cavities, participate in complex commensal or mutualistic relationships with their human host (Dethlefsen et al., 2007; Relman, 2002) . Therefore, it is not advantageous to attempt to eradicate every virus and microbial cell from the body in response to infection. A new medical paradigm is emerging: an illness may be defined by a disruption of the normal \"healthy\" microbiome and/or virome, and that restoration of this state, not elimination of all nonhuman organisms, should be the goal of medical treatment (Harrison, 2007) . Current interest in the human microbiome reflects the increasing acceptance of the view that the microbiota per se should not be seen merely as invasive disease vectors but are in fact an intrinsic part of the human supra-organism (Dethlefsen et al., 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 240, "end": 261, "text": "(Virgin et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 262, "end": 286, "text": "Dethlefsen et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 287, "end": 300, "text": "Relman, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 860, "end": 885, "text": "(Dethlefsen et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 886, "end": 899, "text": "Relman, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1294, "text": "(Harrison, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1553, "text": "(Dethlefsen et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "The classical method of viral isolation is by culturing.

In addition, culturing will be successful only for the small fraction of viruses for which appropriate culture conditions can be determined. To break from the limited view that all viruses are intrinsically harmful requires new methodologies that enable us to characterize entire uncultured viral communities. A culture-independent metagenomics approach to viral community analysis will yield a broader view of the human virome, just as metagenomic sequencing has revealed a wider range of bacteria in the human microbiome than culture-based methods (Harris et al., 2007; Rogers et al., 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 75, "end": 89, "text": "(Rivers, 1937)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 816, "end": 837, "text": "(Harris et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 838, "end": 858, "text": "Rogers et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "A viral metagenome or virome is the total genetic (DNA and RNA) sequence derived from a viral community.

Here the relative frequencies of BLAST n hits to a viral sequence database follow a relationship that can be approximated by a power-law equation of the type y = a x \u2212b Metagenomics has been greatly facilitated by recent advances in sequencing technology. Pyrosequencing (Roche/454 Life Sciences), as well as other technologies (e.g., Solexa, SOLiD), enable routine DNA sequencing on the scale of 10 8 bp. All of these new high-throughput methods replace traditional cloning in bacteria with mechanical separation of DNA molecules by some means (e.g., emPCR with DNA immobilized on beads for 454). This requires the creation of a minimally biased DNA library that better reflects the viral community in the sample. At present, the original DNA sample must often be amplified before sequencing, increasing the opportunity for artificial over-or underrepresentation of particular sequences. Despite this limitation, these methods appear to avoid most of the problems associated with conventional cloning, which is subject to strong sequence bias against some \"unclonable\" sequences. This phenomenon appears to be particularly pronounced in attempts to clone viral sequences. Microarrays, as well, remain semiquantitative detection methods because it is impossible to simultaneously optimize the hybridization of thousands of individual sequences (Table 4 .1).

As a result, viruses that infect microbes (phages) are numerous (Letarov and Kulikov, 2009 ) and have been found in the gut (Reyes et al., 2009) , nasopharynx (Allander et al., 2005) , oropharynx , oral cavity (Hitch et al., 2004) , blood , and lung secretions (Willner et al., 2009a) . Phages comprise by far the majority of the human virome (Willner et al., 2009a and can be expected to exert an influence on the human microbial community (Gill et al., 2006; Hendrix, 2005) that parallels the interactions observed in a variety of environmental samples (Letarov and Kulikov, 2009; Weinbauer, 2006; Rodriguez-Mueller et al., 2010; . By killing specific host organisms, phages regulate the absolute and relative abundance of microbial species . Genetic variation in the hosts is therefore favored as a means of escaping phage predation (Kunin et al., 2008) . In addition, phages are major vehicles of DNA transfer to and from host cells (horizontal gene transfer) through both lytic and lysogenic pathways (Little, 2005) , potentially conferring new phenotypes that can increase the pathogenicity or the fitness (Sharon et al., 2009; Wagner and Waldor, 2002) of the host.

In asymptomatic subjects, the abundance of these viruses is far lower than that of phages in the healthy human body (Willner et al., 2009a . Depending on the area of the body under examination, the presence of eukaryotic viruses will be due to either transient environmental exposure of accessible regions (e.g., the lungs) or chronic infections that do not give rise to recognizable clinical symptoms. The lack of symptoms might reflect a low-level viral infection that is successfully suppressed by the immune system at an early stage, or perhaps a commensal virus that causes no apparent harm (Virgin et al., 2009; Stapleton et al., 2004; Okamoto, 2009; Antonsson et al., 2000) .

These methods will not identify the unknown viruses, but they can help to characterize the sample by defining the overall complexity of the community. Other methods involve analysis based on the percent G/C content of genomes or the relative frequency of various dinucleotide combinations (Karlin et al., 1997; Burge et al., 1992; Karlin, 1998; Willner et al., 2009b) , which in some cases is diagnostic of particular taxa.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 145, "text": "(Angly et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 675, "end": 696, "text": "(Karlin et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 697, "end": 716, "text": "Burge et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 717, "end": 730, "text": "Karlin, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 731, "end": 753, "text": "Willner et al., 2009b)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Similarity-Independent Analyses"}, {"text": "When viruses are purified from any human or environmental sample, the extracted DNA inevitably yields a large number of sequences (usually 70-99%) that show no significant similarity to any known sequences (Fig. 4.4) (Willner et al., 2009a Jones et al., 2005) . Provided that adequate precautions have been taken to avoid contamination with nonviral nucleic acids, this suggests that a very large fraction of the existing viral diversity remains uncharacterized. One of the strengths of the \"untargeted\" approach to viral metagenomics is that these sequences are obtained, but understanding the origin and significance of the \"unknown\" viral sequences is a substantial bioinformatic challenge that has yet to be solved. If a sequence has no similarity to the DNA of known organisms as defined by BLAST (McGinnis and Madden, 2004) or similar search algorithms, other methods must be developed for this purpose. For example, genome organization patterns such as large-scale arrangements of open reading frames or regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers, and origins of replication) may be signatures that would identify sequences as being of viral origin.
