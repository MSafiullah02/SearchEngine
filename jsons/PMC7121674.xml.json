The first eight chapters of this text deal with agent-specific concerns and strategies for dealing with infections due to the intentional release of these agents. A larger problem arises when the identity of an agent is not known. In fact, in some cases, an attack may be threatened or suspected, but it may remain unclear as to whether such an attack has actually occurred. Moreover, it may be unclear whether casualties are due to a biological agent, a chemical agent, or even a naturally occurring infectious disease process or toxic exposure. Recent experience with West Nile Virus (Fine and Layton, 2001), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Lampton, 2003), and monkeypox highlight this dilemma. In each of these cases, the possibility of bioterrorism was raised, and rightly so, although each outbreak ultimately proved to have a natural origin. This chapter provides a framework for dealing with outbreaks of unknown origin and etiology. Furthermore, it addresses several related concerns and topics not covered elsewhere in this text.",

This would be especially true in a medical mass casualty (MASCAL) incident, where a considerable precedent exists for the use of standardized approaches as embodied in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) model sponsored by the American College of Surgeons (1989). It would also be especially true under austere conditions, such as might be seen on the battlefield. In fact, as will be seen, much of the dogma and technology, and many of the strategies advocated for use in responding to a bioterrorist attack, derive from military biowarfare defense doctrine and research. Considerable parallels exist between military biowarfare concerns and civilian bioterrorism concerns. Although major medical centers and research institutions may possess sophisticated diagnostic and response capabilities, the busy clinician practicing in a small town may find their situation much more akin to that of the military on the battlefield. That is, they may be required to make quick therapeutic decisions based on incomplete information and with little immediate support. In the setting of a biological (or chemical) attack, similar to the setting of a MASCAL trauma event, such decisions may have life-and-death implications. In such situations, an algorithmic approach becomes invaluable.",

Here, victims would likely succumb in close temporal and geographic proximity to a dispersal device. Complicating discovery of the sinister nature of a biological attack, however, is the fact that biological agents possess inherent incubation periods, a characteristic not shared with conventional, chemical, and nuclear weapons. These incubation periods, typically days to even weeks in length, allow for the wide dispersion of victims in time and space. Moreover, they make it likely that the \u201cfirst responder\u201d to a biological attack would not likely be the traditional first responder (fire, police, and paramedical personnel), but rather primary care physicians, emergency room personnel, and public health officials. In such circumstances, the maintenance of a healthy \u201cindex of suspicion\u201d is imperative.",

Moreover, in many cases, such findings present a very limited differential diagnosis. Smallpox is characterized by a very unique exanthem. The classic finding in inhala-tional anthrax is a widened mediastinum; in botulism, it is a descending, symmetric, flaccid paralysis. Although a single patient with flaccid paralysis should call to mind the possibility of disorders such as the Guillan-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and myasthenia gravis, the near-simultaneous presentation of multiple patients with flaccid paralysis should point one to a diagnosis of botulism. Similarly, plague victims often develop hemoptysis in the later stages of illness. Such a finding is otherwise uncommon among previously healthy individuals, but can be caused by tuberculosis, Staphylococcal and Klebsiella pneumonia, and carcinoma, among others. Multiple patients with hemoptysis, however, should prompt a diagnosis of plague. Yet, by the time each of these characteristic findings develops, treatment is likely to be ineffective. Therefore, therapy is best instituted during the incubation or prodromal phases of these diseases if it is likely to be of benefit. Because of this, and because many potential biological warfare diseases \u2014 such as tularemia, brucellosis, melioidosis, Q-fever, staphylococcal enterotoxin intoxication, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis are likely to present simply as undifferentiated febrile illnesses \u2014 prompt diagnosis is a possibility only with the maintenance of a high index of suspicion.",

The presence of large numbers of victims clustered in time and space, or limited to a discrete population, should raise the clinician's suspicion. Similarly, cases of unexpected death or unexpectedly severe illness merit concern. Diseases unusual in a given locale, in a given age group, or during a certain season likewise warrant further investigation. Simultaneous outbreaks of a disease in noncontiguous areas should cause one to consider an intentional release, as should outbreaks of multiple diseases in the same area. Conversely, even a single case of rare disorders \u2014 such as anthrax or certain viral hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and many others) \u2014 would be suspicious, and a single case of smallpox would almost certainly be the result of an intentional release. The presence, in the community or the environment, of dying animals (or the simultaneous occurrence of zoonotic outbreaks among humans and animals) might provide evidence of an unnatural aerosol release. Evidence of a disparate attack rate between those known to be indoors and outdoors at a given time should also be sought and evaluated. Finally, intelligence reports, terrorist claims, and the finding of aerosol spray devices would obviously lend credence to the theory that a disease outbreak was of sinister origin. The epidemiologic clues to a biological attack are summarized in Table 9.1.\n\n",

Some have advocated the issuance of similar ensembles to civilians, and, in fact, the Israeli government has issued masks to civilians (principally with chemical agents in mind). Militarystyle protective clothing and masks, even if offered, however, would likely be unavailable at the precise moment of a release of agent. Moreover, the unannounced release by terrorists of odorless, colorless, virtually undetectable biological agents would afford no opportunity to don such gear, even if it were available. Furthermore, the misuse of protective equipment in the past has led to fatalities, including infants left to suffocate in \u201cprotective\u201d ensembles (Hiss and Arensburg, 1992). A simple surgical mask will protect against inhalation of infectious aerosols of virtually any of the biological agents typically mentioned in a terrorism context. The lone exception would be smallpox, where a high-efficiency particu-late air filter mask would be ideal. With the exception of smallpox, pneumonic plague, and, to a lesser degree, certain viral hemorrhagic fevers, the agents in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) categories A and B (Table 9.2) are not contagious via the respiratory route. Respiratory protection is thus necessary when operating in an area of primary release, but would not be required in most patient-care settings.\n\n",

It is conceivable, given credible and specific intelligence, that similar strategies might be used against biological weapons.

This is not to say that immunization against a specific agent is necessarily appropriate. Rather, the decision to offer a specific vaccine to the general population is a complex one, which must take into account a careful risk-benefit calculation. Factors that would influence a decision by public health officials to recommend immunization include intelligence (How likely and/or plausible is an attack? How imminent is the threat? How specific is the threat?), vaccine safety, vaccine availability, disease consequences (Is the threat from a lethal agent? Or merely from an incapacitant?), and the feasibility of postexposure prophylaxis and/or therapy.

Anthrax vaccine\u2014adsorbed (AVA; Bioport, Lansing, Michigan) was licensed by the U.S. FDA in 1970 and consists of a purified preparation of protective antigen (a potent immunogen, protective antigen is critical for entry of lethal and edema factors into mammalian cells; it is nonpathogenic when given alone). In a large controlled trial, AVA was shown effective at preventing cutaneous anthrax among textile workers (Brachman et al., 1962). Based on an increasing amount of animal data, there is every reason to believe that this vaccine is quite effective at preventing inhalational anthrax as well. Moreover, at least 18 studies now attest to the safety of AVA (Cieslak et al., in press). Nonetheless, logistical and other considerations make large-scale civilian employment of AVA impractical at present. The vaccine is licensed as a six-dose series, given at 0, 2, and 4 weeks, and again at 6, 12, and 18 months. Yearly boosters are recommended for those at ongoing risk. Further complicating any potential anthrax immunization strategy is the fact that AVA is approved by the U.S. FDA only for those persons 18\u201365 years of age. Although a large-scale pre-exposure offering of AVA to the public might thus be problematic, some authors allow that three doses of the vaccine, given in conjunction with antibiotics, may enhance protection and/or enable the clinician to shorten a postexposure antibiotic course (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002). In this regard, a three-dose series of AVA (given at time 0 and at 2 and 4 weeks after the initial dose), combined with 30 days of antibiotics, may be an acceptable alternative to longer (60\u2013100 days) antibiotic courses alone in the treatment of, or postexposure prophylaxis against, inhalational anthrax. It should be noted that AVA is not licensed by the U.S. FDA for postexposure use.",

The vaccine currently used in the United States is Dryvax\u00ae (Wyeth Laboratories, Marietta, Pa.), a preparation derived from the harvested lymph of calves inoculated with a strain of Vaccinia, an orthopoxvirus closely related to Variola. Production of Dryvax\u00ae ceased in 1981 and lots currently in use are more than 20 years old. New generation vaccines are in production, however, and should be available very soon. Many health authorities have chosen to wait until these new products are available before readdressing the question of civilian vaccination. These new vaccines are produced in cell culture rather than calf lymph. It is unlikely that this will significantly diminish the risk of adverse reactions, however, as the new vaccines will use the same live strain of vaccinia virus. The vast majority of adverse reactions to current vaccinia-containing vaccines derive from the live nature of the virus, rather than the method of preparation.",

By conferring individual and herd immunity, and by obviating the mayhem of implementing postrelease vaccine and quarantine programs, such a program possesses distinct advantages over other response plans. However, such an approach is currently hampered not only by the unknown risk of a smallpox release, but also by vaccine supply, safety, and logistics issues (Fauci, 2002; Amorosa and Isaacs, 2003). The increasing number of persons at risk for severe vaccine reactions due to compromised immunity or dermatologic conditions (such as eczema) raises concern about the safety of a pre-exposure vaccination program in the era of epidemic HIV, organ transplantation, and immunosuppressive therapy (Bozzette et al., 2003; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003b; Grabenstein and Winkenwerder, 2003; Kemper et al., 2002). In addition, the incidence of rare but severe smallpox vaccine complications in otherwise healthy recipients could result in a number of deaths and cases of severe disease that would be unacceptable were the risk of a smallpox release low. Risk analysis favors prerelease mass vaccination of the general population only if the probability of a large-scale or multifocal attack is high. However, prerelease mass vaccination of health care workers is favored at lower probabilities of attack, because of an increased probability of exposure while caring for patients, and the value of keeping health care workers healthy and functioning in the setting of an epidemic (Bozzette et al., 2003).",

Safety concerns have resulted in a program to treat certain severe complications with vaccinia immune globulin under an investigational new drug protocol, as well as the establishment of a Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (Health Resources and Services Administration, 2003), which provides compensation to persons developing severe adverse reactions. More than 38,000 civilian health care and public health workers have been vaccinated, with no deaths and no cases of eczema vaccinatum, fetal vaccinia, or progressive vaccina. Although the emergence of myopericarditis as a complication of vaccination (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003c, 2003d; Halsell et al., 2003) lead to a revision of prevaccine screening (candidates with multiple cardiac risk factors are now excluded), rates of other adverse reactions were low.

Mass vaccination would be reserved for instances when the number cases or the location of cases renders the ring strategy inefficient, or if the risk of additional smallpox releases is high (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003e). Although ring vaccination was successful in containing smallpox in the setting of herd immunity, mathematical models predict that this strategy may not initially contain large or multifocal epidemics (Kaplan et al., 2002). Furthermore, there is disagreement regarding the predicted benefit of postrelease mass vaccination, due to the lack of herd immunity, a highly mobile population, a relatively long incubation, and difficulties implementing quarantine and mass vaccination promptly (Mack, 2003; Mortimer, 2003). This brings us back to the dilemma posed by pre-exposure mass vaccination in the context of uncertain risk, and the realization that vaccination is only one component of a multifaceted response, to include farsighted planning and logistical preparation, risk communication, surveillance, isolation, quarantine, and humane treatment of patients.",

Victims of bioterrorism might also present, as previously noted, with little more than an undifferentiated febrile illness. By categorizing victims in this manner, logical empiric therapy decisions can be facilitated (Cieslak, et al., 2000; Cieslak and Henretig, 2003a; Henretig et al., 2002).",

When the identity of a bioterrorist agent is known, the provision of proper therapy is straightforward. Our recommendations for such therapy are provided in Table 9.3. When a clinician, in relatively austere circumstances, however, is faced with multiple victims and the nature of the illness is not known, empiric therapy must be instituted. Guidelines for the provision of empiric therapy in such situations have been published (Cieslak et al., 2000), and we advocate that doxycycline or ciprofloxacin be administered empirically to patients with significant pulmonary symptoms when exposure to a bioterrorist attack is considered a strong possibility.\n\n",

Under such circumstances, an extensive array of supporting assets and capabilities may be called on. In the U.S. system, the \u201cIncident Command System\u201d (ICS) provides a standardized approach to command and control of an incident scene (Emergency Management Institute, 1998). Local officials use this system when responding to natural disasters, as well as to man-made incidents. Its use would be equally appropriate in the response to a biological attack. Under the ICS, a designated official, often the fire chief or the chief of police, serves as local incident commander. In any incident, when local resources or capabilities are exceeded, the local incident commander may request assistance from the state through the State Coordinating Officer (SCO). The SCO works with the governor and other state officials to make state-level assets available. State Health Departments and Public Health Laboratories, as well as State Police capabilities, are among these assets. Most state public health laboratories possess \u201cLevel C\u201d capabilities, and can provide sophisticated confirmatory diagnosis and typing of biological agents (Gilchrist, 2000; Morse et al., 2003). [An overview of public health laboratory capabilities is provided in Table 9.6. The biosafety level (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1999) precautions they employ are outlined in Table 9.7.] Moreover, State Police can provide law enforcement assistance and forensic laboratory analysis. Finally, state governors can access military assets directly through National Guard units under their direct control. These units can provide law enforcement, public works assistance, mobile \u201cfield\u201d hospital bed capacity, and other support. Specifically, many state governors now have, at their disposal, military \u201cWeapons of Mass Destruction\u2014Civil Support\u201d teams, which can offer expert advice and provide liaison to more robust military assets at the federal level.\n\n\n",

The Canadian Science Center for Human and Animal Health in Winnipeg provides a similar level of expertise. Expert consultation and assistance with epidemiological investigations is also available from the CDC, and threat evaluation and medical consultation is similarly available through USAMRIID. Additionally, the military can provide expert advice and assistance to civilian authorities through the Chemical/ Biological Rapid Response Team (CBRRT), which can arrive at a disaster site within a few hours of notification. Another potentially useful military asset is the Chemical/Biological Incident Response Force, a Marine Corps unit capable of providing reconnaissance, decontamination, and field treatment. Like the CBRRT, this unit can potentially be available within a few hours of notification. Military support, when requested, would be subordinate to civilian authorities, and would be provided and tailored by the Joint Task Force for Civil Support. This task force, a component of U.S. Northern Command, is specifically designed to provide command and control for all military assets involved in disaster response missions and contingencies within the United States. Finally, the CDC has developed the Strategic National Stockpile, whereby critical drugs and vaccines necessary to combat a large disaster or terrorist attack are stockpiled at several locations throughout the country, available for rapid deployment to an affected area (Esbitt, 2003). Release of stockpile components is currently controlled by the Department of Homeland Security.

An announced or threatened bioterroism attack can provoke fear, uncertainty, and anxiety in the population, resulting in overwhelming numbers of patients seeking medical evaluation for unexplained symptoms, and demanding antidotes for feared exposure. Such a scenario could also follow a covert release when the resulting epidemic is characterized as the consequence of a bioterror attack. Symptoms due to anxiety and autonomic arousal, and side effects of postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis may suggest prodromal disease due to biological agent exposure, and pose challenges in differential diagnosis. This \u201cbehavioral contagion\u201d is best prevented by risk communication from health and government authorities that includes a realistic assessment of the risk of exposure, information about the resulting disease, and what to do and whom to contact for suspected exposure. Risk communication must be timely, accurate, consistent, and well coordinated. As the epidemic subsides and public knowledge increases, public anxiety will decrease to realistic levels. This cycle of uncertainty, panic, response, and resolution occurred during the October 2001 anthrax bioterror event (Rundell, 2003).

Such exercises may involve only the leadership of an organization and focus on planning and decision-making (the \u201ccommand post exercise\u201d), they may involve notional \u201cplay\u201d around a \u201ctable-top exercise,\u201d or they may involve actual \u201chands-on\u201d training and evaluation in a \u201cdisaster drill\u201d or \u201cfield-training exercise.\u201d In fact, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requires hospitals to conduct a hazard vulnerability analysis, develop an emergency management plan, and evaluate this plan annually (Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, 2003). Moreover, JCAHO specifically mandates that hospitals provide facilities (and training in the use of such facilities) for radioactive, biological, and chemical isolation and decontamination.",

Moreover, electronic resources of a similar nature have been developed (U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, 2000; U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2000) and multiple websites provide a wealth of training materials and information on-line (Ferguson et al., 2003) (Table 9.5). Finally, as discussed under step 8, numerous governmental, military, and civilian organizations now stand ready to provide assistance and consultation to the clinician faced with planning for, and treating, the victims of a potential terrorist attack. It is assistance that, if sought for planning purposes, will hopefully never be needed for patient management.",
