These savings result from avoidance of unnecessary infection control measures and shorter length of hospital stay. Our results are consistent with recent studies describing that rapid influenza diagnostic tests reduced costs by a reduction of the time spent at the emergency department, less unnecessary patient isolation because of rapid negative results and a decrease of the number of patient admissions. 11-13 Our study is the first to assess the potential impact of molecular POC tests for influenza and RSV using a model that was populated with real-world data on the complete trajectory of a cohort of patients suspected of viral respiratory infection through the hospital, from primary contact on the emergency department or outpatient clinic to discharge. The largest potential cost reduction attributable to the POC test was on the length of stay in the hospital, although it is not clear whether POC testing indeed reduces the length of stay. Most data regarding the effect of rapid testing for influenza and/or RSV on patient care and hospital management are on the basis of retrospective, observational studies. Observational studies have shown that POC testing contributes to a shorter length of stay, a reduction in (duration of) antibiotic use and the prescription of antiviral therapy", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Briefly, nucleic acids were extracted from 200 \u00b5L sample using the MagNA Pure and the MagNA-Pure LC TNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands).

This could potentially impact in-hospital costs. There is an ongoing debate about the added value of large multiplex PCR panels for respiratory pathogens compared to more specific influenza/RSV PCR especially during the influenza season, in which a substantial part of respiratory infections causing hospital admission is caused by influenza or RSV.23 In our hospital, infection control policy is mainly focused on influenza and RSV; for other respiratory viruses, a more differentiated approach is taken, implementing infection control measures only on high-risk wards. Thus, the potential impact on in-hospital costs of admission of patients with respiratory infections caused by other viruses than influenza and RSV during the influenza season is considered limited.The model did not include costs of (inappropriate) antimicrobial therapy because information on the presence or absence of bacterial pathogens was lacking. Early detection of respiratory pathogens by rapid molecular tests has the potential of reducing the duration of empirically started antibiotics. This would result in a reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use, antibiotic pressure and antimicrobial resistance, which would further enhance the benefits associated with POC testing in this patient group. Moreover, available data suggest that a rapid diagnosis could lead to less additional laboratory testing and medical procedures, however, this might only be true for influenza positive patients.13,22,24 A key assumption underlying our model is that clinicians act upon the results of the POC test, for example by not prescribing antibiotics to patients who test positive. In practice, clinicians may decide otherwise. Thus, prospective, randomized controlled studies are needed to assess the actual impact of POC test on patient management and infection control, including the effect on patient outcome. These trials should not only focus on actual changes in patient care but also on the complex mechanisms underlying the clinical decision-making process in the cascade of events during hospital admission and thus the impact of rapid diagnosis on the behavior and considerations regarding patient care.In conclusion, the introduction of POC molecular diagnostic testing for influenza and RSV for patients presenting with symptoms of a viral respiratory tract infection at the hospital may lead to a more timely installment of appropriate infection control measures and a shorter duration of hospital admission, thus reducing inhospital costs.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "RAHAMAT-LANGENDOEN ET AL.
