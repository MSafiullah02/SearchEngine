Crowd model outputs have been used for evaluating safety and comfort of pedestrians, inform crowd management and perform forensic investigations. Microscopic crowd models allow the representation of each person and the obtainment of information concerning their location over time and interactions with the physical space/other people. Pandemics such as COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of disease transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling can be used to assess occupant exposure in confined spaces. The policies adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a pandemic can vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the spread of disease rather than a safety assessment performed at a building level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant exposure in buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement. Risk assessment is performed by retrofitting crowd models with a universal model for exposure assessment which can account for different types of disease transmissions. This work allows policy makers to perform informed decisions concerning building usage during a pandemic.",

            "text": "Any stakeholder dealing with crowds is greatly affected by a pandemic. Events involving large crowds have been cancelled or postponed worldwide, access to public buildings has been restricted as different mitigation measures have been adopted around the world to decrease physical interactions among people during the COVID-19 pandemic (Anderson et al., 2020) . The measures to face pandemics adopted by policy makers ranged from compulsory lockdowns to recommendations on social distancing (also called physical distancing). One key aspect sticks out in the current situation, i.e. the inconsistency in the adopted measures is evident. For instance, to the date this paper was written (May 2020), social distancing recommendations are diverse in different countries and rapidly change over time, e.g., 1 person/4 m 2 (Australia), 1 m (Philippines, Qatar) or 2 m outside home (Canada, UAE, UK, South Korea), or 1-2 m (New Zealand, Italy) (Italian Government, 2020; Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance, 2020; Movement Strategies, 2020) . This raises questions on their implications on space usage (Honey-Roses et al., 2020) , how policy makers have grounded their decisions and what type of models are currently available to support these decisions. Moreover, current data do not fully support the 1-2 m rule for spatial separation assumed for travelling of large droplets (Bahl et al., 2020) which has been issued in the airborne precautions for the COVID-19 pandemic in the guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020) . This issue highlights the need for flexible models able to use different assumptions on disease transmission mechanisms.",

Nevertheless, their great limitation is that they may not fully consider the mobility patterns of individuals and the heterogeneity in their interactions. This issue has been raised in the largest conference in the pedestrian and evacuation dynamics community back in 2012 (Johansson & Gosc\u00e8, 2014) and has initiated discussions on coupling the field of crowd dynamics and modelling with epidemiological modelling (Gosc\u00e9 et al., 2014) . The impact of heterogeneity in population and mobility patterns have been so far addressed mostly at a macroscopic scale, especially in transportation environments (Gosc\u00e9 & Johansson, 2018; Meloni et al., 2011; Saberi et al., 2020) in which transport networks are investigated to consider them while modelling the spread of disease. Nevertheless, current disease-spreading models do not explicitly represent the space usage of pedestrians at a microscopic scale, thus making difficult to assess at a building level what the impact of a social distance measure could be.",

Crowd models have been used so far mostly to ensure comfort and safety of pedestrians and identify crowd management solutions to optimize movement flows and reduce waiting times Johansson, 2008 ). It appears evident that the simulation of people movement at a microscopic scale could provide a great help to decision makers for risk assessment in case of disease spreading in a confined space. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the most known and used crowd models (Lovreglio et al., 2019) have released new features aimed at microscopic modelling of people movement considering social distancing or counting the interactions between pedestrians in a given social distance radius. While these features are useful to evaluate space usage, given the lack of knowledge concerning the current spread of disease, they do not allow a comprehensive quantitative understanding of the impact of different measures on building occupant exposure. It is therefore crucial to develop a general occupant exposure model which could be used to retrofit any type of microscopic crowd model and that is able to produce quantitative outputs for risk assessment. In turn, crowd models do not currently provide dedicated comprehensive sub-models which can be directly used to perform this type of analysis.",

It should be noted that most current crowd models generally assume rigid bodies (Duives et al., 2013) , i.e. non-deformable pedestrian bodies which allow the detection of collision and contacts between agents. Therefore, this is practically implemented considering the representation of the agents (often represented in crowd models as circles or ellipses) and exploring that their coordinate in space overlap within a certain radius corresponding to their dimensions. The example in Figure 1 .1 shows one agent and one agent that are in physical contact within a room.

Finally, it is possible to obtain the global assessment of occupant exposure using Equation 6 (considering both assumptions of = 1 or increasing linearly. The final value for when = 1 is 231.6 min, while assuming increasing linearly corresponds to 1131.6 min. The calculated value for can be evaluated against an acceptance criteria or several values can be calculated to compare different scenarios, assumptions, or conditions.",

Its flexibility along with its simplicity is deemed to encourage its immediate usage and exploitation in the crowd modelling community.

Current crowd models do several simplifications in the representation of the human body (calculations are generally made considering a circle/ellipse representing a human in a 2D space (Fruin, 1987) which is then extruded in a 3D environment). Novel crowd modelling approaches are investigating more accurate representation of human movement based on biomechanical models (Thompson et al., 2015) , thus it is expected that they will be able in the future to investigate even more microscopic interactions with objects. This information could directly be exploited in risk assessments using EXPOSED. E. Ronchi, R. Lovreglio. EXPOSED: An occupant exposure model for confined spaces to retrofit crowd models during a pandemic An additional advantage on the use of microscopic modelling of crowd movement to assess occupant exposure is that it allows for in-depth considerations on the individual attributes of the agents. For instance, existing crowd models often implement socio-demographic variables (e.g. age, gender, physical abilities, functional limitations) (Duives et al., 2013; Geoerg et al., 2018) which affect people movement and in turn can affect occupant exposure. This means that the use of EXPOSED coupled with a microscopic crowd model takes into account the higher exposure of individuals whose attribute make them more vulnerable in a crowd (e.g. people walking slower or spending more time in performing way-finding in a building).",
