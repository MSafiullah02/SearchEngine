Taiwan launched the NHI program in 1995 and has since maintained >95% enrollment rate, with the coverage >98.5% since 2007. The NHIRD thus allows researchers to follow up on all the medical service utilizations of every pregnant women in Taiwan. In addition, many studies have demonstrated the high validity of the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000,26, 27 with hundreds of papers employing the NHIRD having been published in internationally peer-reviewed journals.",

In addition, our results are also in line with 1 study conducted by Romanyuk et al16 that found pneumonia to be significantly associated with CS, low Apgar scores, and preeclampsia. Although some previous studies failed to observe any increased risk of preterm4, 23, 24, 25 or LBW3 infants among women with pneumonia, these inverse conclusions were mostly based on studies utilizing patient self-reports and characterized by relatively small sample sizes and an inadequate control of confounding. Therefore, their recall bias and other potential limitations may have resulted in an under-ascertainment of pneumonia during the study pregnancy, which would have clearly undermined the strength of their findings.",

Development of the fetus is largely determined by the morphology and functioning of the mother-placenta-fetus system.28, 29 It is possible that pneumonia during pregnancy may infect the placenta. Infection may then be transmitted to the fetus from the placenta through the umbilical vein, or via the aspiration or ingestion of amniotic fluid contaminated by placental or genital infections. Intrauterine infection has emerged as a frequent and important mechanism of disease in preterm birth.30, 31, 32, 33 The onset of preterm labor can be considered a mechanism of the host defense against intrauterine infection whereby the mother eliminates infected tissues (membranes, decidua, and/or fetus) to maintain reproductive fitness.34 Moreover, a higher risk of LBW and SGA was noted in the pneumonia group, probably due to the lower gestational age at delivery.",

Their gravid uterus has been shown to elevate the diaphragm by up to 4 cm in the third trimester, while oxygen consumption is increased by 20% during pregnancy and functional residual capacity is decreased, rendering the woman intolerant to hypoxia.35 Therefore, severe maternal respiratory illness affecting the fetal oxygen supply may seriously endanger the fetus. Wong et al20 found that these patients had frequent episodes of oxygen desaturation, often falling <90%. The situation resembles that of those living at high altitudes, causing a low arterial partial pressure of oxygen36, 37 and consequent adverse pregnancy outcomes. In addition, since the stress of severe hypoxia usually necessitates delivery by CS, a higher risk of CS was also noted in our pneumonia mothers.",

Moreover, in this study the majority of pregnant women with a case of pneumonia experienced the onset of disease during their first trimester. This finding is supported by a study conducted by Lindsay et al38 that reported a decline in the rate of influenza-like illness episodes as the stage of pregnancy progressed. One possible reason underlying this finding may involve behavioral changes that may be associated with a woman's pregnancy status and knowledge of her pregnancy status. Women in the second and third trimesters of their pregnancies, who are more likely to be aware of their pregnancy status, may be more prudent in avoiding occasions where they may encounter people with colds, the flu, or other respiratory track infections, and may adopt a stricter practice of other preventative behaviors such as an increased frequency of hand washing. On the other hand, women who are not yet pregnant or have become pregnant but are unaware of their pregnancy status may be less likely to engage in such preventative behaviors. It is further possible that some of the women experiencing pneumonia in this study had already encountered or had been infected with pneumonia at the time they became pregnant but were only at a subclinical or incubation stage of the disease. Nevertheless, the underlying factors contributing to the higher incidence of pneumonia during the first trimester remain obscure and deserve further investigation.",

We believe that the increased risk for adverse birth outcomes among women with pneumonia during their pregnancies warrants a higher level of surveillance among this population to ensure that medical intervention be exercised as soon as possible. This recommendation is supported by 1 recent review study which observed that concern for fetal outcome should not delay treatment, as improvement in maternal status and most particularly oxygenation is the best way to ensure that the fetus will be protected. In addition, the treatment in the gravid patient should generally follow standard guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia in adults.39 Therefore, early recognition of the disease process and prompt treatment are required to best ensure for an optimal outcome for both mother and fetus. Furthermore, primary prevention in the form of a pneumococcal vaccine is both available and recommended for pregnant women with underlying diseases (eg, immunocompromised states, diabetes, chronic cardiopulmonary diseases) to reduce their risks of pneumonia episodes.39 The results of this study further underscore the utility of this vaccine.",

However, to the best of our knowledge all the previous studies investigating pregnancy outcomes among women with pneumonia have been conducted in Western countries with this investigation being the first study regarding pregnancy outcomes among women with pneumonia in Asia. Unlike prior studies that included participants from diverse ethnic groups, >98% of Taiwan's residents are of Chinese Han ethnicity, so the composition of the population is quite homogenous. While this may exempt our study from potential confounding by race, it also means that our results may not be generalizable to other ethnic groups. In addition, we used nationwide population-based datasets, linking the NHIRD with the national registry of births, which leaves little room for selection and nonresponse biases. Moreover, the very large sample size used in this study provides ample statistical power to detect differences between pregnant women with and without pneumonia in risk of adverse birth outcomes.",
