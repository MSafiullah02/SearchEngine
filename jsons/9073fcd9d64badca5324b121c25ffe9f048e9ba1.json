Previous studies examining dogs of all age groups (Dunn & Dunn 1998 , Battersby et al. 2006 , Chervier et al. 2012 ) have demonstrated the same bias towards non-infectious inflammatory conditions, particularly immune-mediated disorders (34\u20228%, 22% and 48% of dogs in each study, respectively), but this appears to be even stronger in this population of young dogs. An increased proportion of juvenile dogs diagnosed with noninfectious inflammatory disease relative to previous studies was commensurate with a decreased proportion of infectious (13\u20226% in this study compared with 25\u20228%, 16% and 18%) and, more intuitively, neoplastic diseases (one dog of 140 in this population compared with 7\u20226%, 9\u20225% and 6%). The proportion of dogs in which a diagnosis was not reached was comparable between our data and previous studies (17\u20228% compared with 22\u20227%, 19% and 28%). Interestingly, in all but one dog, the lack of a diagnosis in these 25 dogs was due to the resolution of clinical signs during hospitalisation, and SRMA was frequently recorded as the presumed diagnosis based on signalment and clinical investigation findings. This suspicion is supported by the well-established waxing and waning nature of immune-mediated disease, including SRMA (Tipold & Schatzberg 2010) . The most common disease diagnosed within the non-infectious inflammatory disease category was SRMA, representing almost half of all referred dogs in which a diagnosis was reached (55/115 dogs, 48%). This contrasts with reports by Battersby et al. (2006) and Dunn & Dunn (1998) in which seven of 66 dogs (11%) and no dogs of 101 dogs were diagnosed with SMRA, respectively. This preponderance of SRMA in juvenile dogs is not unexpected given that the typical age of onset is known to be less than 24 months (Scott-Moncrieff et al. 1992 , Rose et al. 2014 . Immune-mediated polyarthritis was identified in 15 dogs in this study (11%), with four having concurrent inflammatory dermatopathies, which is similar to the proportion of dogs presenting in all age groups (20 of 101 dogs, 20% in Dunn & Dunn 1998 and five of 66 dogs, 8% in Battersby et al. 2006 ) and is not unexpected given that IMPA is an immune-mediated disorder typically affecting young and middle-aged dogs (Clements et al. 2004 , Rondeau et al. 2005 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 264, "text": "(Dunn & Dunn 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 265, "end": 288, "text": ", Battersby et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 289, "end": 311, "text": ", Chervier et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1469, "text": "(Tipold & Schatzberg 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1725, "text": "Battersby et al.

Similar to our population of dogs suffering from infectious causes of pyrexia, pneumonia was an important cause and was identified in 23% of children with an infectious cause (Chow & Robinson 2011) .

This difference may reflect the higher proportion of immunemediated disease in our population, in which response to NSAIDs or antimicrobials would not be anticipated. Antipyretic therapy, including NSAIDs and acetominophen, is common in people with fever, particularly in children (Drwal-Klein & Phelps 1992) . Large meta-analyses have failed to find evidence that treatment of the fever improves the course of illness and that, in critically ill patients, antipyretic therapy is controversial and sometimes contraindicated (Niven et al. 2013) . This emphasises the important point that pyrexia is not the primary illness but a physiological mechanism that results from an inflammatory focus.

In addition, therapy deemed supportive may in fact have influenced the ability to achieve a diagnosis; for example, opiate analgesia may have masked clinical signs such as neck pain in presenting dogs, with signs then resolving before investigation because of the waxing and waning nature of immune-mediated disease, including SRMA. In addition, referral may have been prompted by dogs with more vague signs rather than obvious infectious disease. A (well-founded) reluctance to perform CSF sampling in primary care practice may have biased our population towards SRMA. In dogs with resolving pyrexia, the diagnosis of \"presumed SRMA\" must be interpreted cautiously as this may have been subject to clinician bias rather than an accurate diagnosis. Given that this study was single-centred and based in the United Kingdom, the preponderance of diagnosis of SRMA may be regional in nature. Rose et al.
