This is especially true for organisms for which culture was not a feasible modality, and instead culture-independent methods such as antigen detection, direct staining, or targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were the aggregate conventional methods. Since the late 2000s, commercial manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic products have invested significant resources into the development of multiplex molecular diagnostic assays that are capable of detecting a broad array of pathogens that collectively could cause a single clinical syndrome. This became known as the syndromic panel approach to pathogen testing, and this avenue of test design and development has carried through the recent decade with an ever-growing portfolio of offerings from various in vitro diagnostic manufacturers.",

Although many of the advantages of syndromic testing have been met with equal and opposite disadvantages and challenges, a common opinion is that molecular methodologies for many conventional infections are more accurate, rapid, and convenient than most traditional culture and direct detection techniques previously used by laboratories. But what is next and what should the future of these syndromic panels look like? Where are the gaps and what are the unmet needs? This article describes the current state-of-the-art with regards to commercially available (primary those cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) syndromic panels for respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal (GI) pathogen detection, blood stream infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections, while providing a provocative and speculative look into the future of syndromic panel testing for infectious diseases.",

The FilmArray RP2Plus panel currently includes the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; however, the clinical performance is not fully understood owing to limited widespread circulation of the virus. This target is suppressed in patients who do not meet clinically compatible presentations. This opens up an interesting future opportunity for flexible testing options related to such pathogens. Because the positive predictive value of a test result will be significantly impaired in the absence of circulating virus, emerging respiratory pathogens (eg, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, enterovirus D68, severe acute respiratory syndrome) could be included in a syndromic panel, but the end-user could have the option of disabling this target in the absence of documented circulation.",

Although this may be an Orwellian, intrusive system, a similar voluntary surveillance system already exists for BioFire users and could have value in future epidemiologic outbreak identification.3 Rather than continuing to chase outbreaks after the fact, earlier crowd sharing of silent surveillance data could serve the entire community while not sounding an alarm on a sporadic false-positive result.

One study has already demonstrated the value of detecting C cayetanensis directly from stool specimens during an outbreak.7 Despite this prevalence and clinical/epidemiologic significance, the target has been excluded from multiple panels in favor of E histolytica (see Tables 3 and 4). Although E histolytica is a virulent protozoal pathogen, its incidence is very low in developed countries. In this author\u2019s laboratory, Cyclospora is the most frequently detected protozoal pathogen and E histolytica ranks fifth of the 5 protozoa detected by a syndromic panel. Furthermore, some commercial assays are not able to specifically identify E histolytica from the nonpathogenic Entamoeba dispar.

This is a significant milestone in BSI diagnostics and provides insight for future panels. For starters, whole blood syndromic testing is an adjunct to conventional blood cultures and manufacturers must consider the pediatric population and associated blood volume limitations. A requirement of less than 1 mL of blood in children would be optimal. Second, the targets incorporated must be analogous to the aforementioned direct from positive blood culture panels. Preferably, a compendious list of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens should be offered, without compromising the sensitivity of the test. The ability to detect polymicrobial infections despite low pathogen load is paramount for appropriate antimicrobial coverage. Importantly, the breadth of targets and high sensitivity will allow for high confidence in a negative result to potentially decrease antimicrobial use. An overarching goal is to be as target agnostic as possible while maintaining rapidity.",

Manufacturers must be aware of the budgetary limitations instilled on laboratories that may prohibit adoption. The development of a diagnostic algorithm that integrates host response as a predicate of whole blood syndromic testing may be a potential strategy to distinguish low risk patients from septic patients. The SeptiCyte (Immunexpress Inc., Seattle, WA), a recently FDA-cleared quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR based assay, measures levels of biomarkers (CEACAM4, LAMP1, PLA2G7, and PLAC8) to distinguish between sepsis and noninfectious process in adult patients only.15 A pilot study of 70 pediatric patients also demonstrated promising results.16 A noteworthy limitation is the required 2.5 mL for testing and future development of host response assays should also be cognizant of blood volume constraints.",
