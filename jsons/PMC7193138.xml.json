We all remember the disastrous stimulus package of the Obama administration\u2019s first term, in which bankers largely profited to the behest of working people (Taibbi 2013). The rhetoric is already leaning toward massive amounts that may not fully assist or alter the already highly inequitable equation that places may people in debt, in poverty, and in a state of hopelessness. Tankersley and Casselman (2020), in a New York Times report, highlight the disproportionate ramifications of what is likely to transpire:To blunt the fallout, Washington is weighing proposals that could easily top $2 trillion, a staggering jump from the initial $8.3 billion virus response bill lawmakers approved this month. That includes a $1 trillion request President Trump floated with Congress on Wednesday, which would provide direct payments to individuals and small businesses, along with aid for airlines and other affected industries\u2026.Payments to large companies could prove trickier. Many of the companies now asking for government support received a big corporate tax break from Mr. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts and have spent years returning cash to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. That has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accuse big companies of moving jobs out of the United States and putting shareholders ahead of workers, whose wages have risen only modestly since the last recession ended in 2009.The four biggest American airlines collectively bought back $39 billion in stock from 2015 to 2019 and paid out $6 billion in dividends, according to data from Capital IQ. The companies that make up the broader S&P 500 index spent more than $5 trillion in buybacks and dividends over that period. (Tankersley and Casselman 2020)",

Why not address the legitimate concerns of the gilets jaunes, who have been protesting the streets in France for the past year? Why not fully address the underlying conditions that promote, enhance, and solidify social inequalities? If funds are available for the military, how can this be considered a societal investment? How do we stand by in the face of the continuous cultural genocide of Indigenous peoples? And what is the connection to democracy? Maintaining these social inequalities makes no economic sense, yet changing the systems, structures, and values that underpin them is a spectacularly arduous and debilitating task.",

We will help Canadians financially (Hall and MacSweeney 2020). I agree full-heartedly and would also agree that this should not be the case when there is no pandemic. The case is made over and over that resources are too limited to assist those facing the greatest challenges, yet, during a time of crisis, the will to find these resources is significant.",

But the potential to work together, across identities, borders, experiences, and philosophies to achieve a more global assessment, engagement, and solidarity to confront global challenges, such as pandemics, and, notably, the environment, should be a worthy and necessary political project.",
