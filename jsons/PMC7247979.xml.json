A very recent report identified the interaction between the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 and the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as critical for viral entry into host cells.1 Because of the strong link between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 infection, inhibitors of ACE2 have been discussed as potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19.2\n,\n3 We believe there already might be a safe, potential inhibitor of ACE2 function that could constrain the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells\u2014and that is the trace mineral zinc. Given that zinc supplements are widely used, proven safe in moderate doses, and available without prescription, we propose that there is an urgent need to determine if zinc can be an effective prophylactic treatment against COVID-19.",

Research at that time identified interaction between the S protein of SARS-CoV and ACE2 as a mechanism of viral infection.4 ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein characterized by the HEXXH + E zinc-binding domain and is found on the surface of epithelial cells of the heart, lung, kidney, and intestine. ACE2 has also been found to be expressed in cells of the upper respiratory tract and in oral epithelial cells.5\n,\n6 This could explain why the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be highly infectious and COVID-19 symptoms can include pneumonia and diarrhea. Despite being a zinc metallopeptidase, very little research has been done on the effect of exogenous zinc on ACE2 function. One report showed that zinc blocked the ability of ACE2 to metabolize substrate in a dose-dependent manner starting at concentrations as small as 10 \u03bcM,7 indicating that zinc could possibly inhibit the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2.",

It has also been suggested that zinc can inhibit coronavirus replication by the inhibition of RNA synthesis.13 Clearly, there is an urgent need to further study the antiviral mechanisms of zinc, particularly as they relate to coronaviruses. It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and rhinoviruses all use different cellular receptors, but the presence of ACE2 on the epithelium of the oral cavity and upper airway offers an excellent rationale for oral zinc therapy.",

Given that a vaccine is at least a year away, any safe, natural compound with antiviral potential should be given serious consideration as a prophylactic agent. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies will ultimately need to be done to prove the efficacy of zinc supplements against SARS-CoV-2. However, because of their availability, safety, and potential benefits, they merit strong consideration for immediate studies (analyzing possible differences in progression of respiratory disease patients between AREDS 2 users and abstainers) by health researchers at this time to identify a possible tool that can work against COVID-19. In view of the serious, life-threatening circumstances of this pandemic, we believe there is potential benefit in taking oral zinc for those at risk of developing COVID-19.
