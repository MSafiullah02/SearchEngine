            "text": "Eukaryotes have evolved numerous intrinsic mechanisms to combat microbial infections. The interferon (IFN) system is a major innate antiviral pathway that is present in vertebrate cells. It is rapidly activated in a tightly regulated fashion in response to viral infections. Viral nucleic acids in viral genomes or generated during viral replication present major pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to various cellular PAMP receptors, including the membrane bound toll-like receptors (TLRs) or the cytoplasmic RIG-like receptors (RLRs). Upon engagement with their cognate ligands, the TLRs and RLRs recruit distinct adaptor proteins and transmit signals to downstream kinases, culminating in the activation of the latent transcription factors, IRF3 and NF-kB, which coordinately regulate synthesis of type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b2 and -\u03b1) (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2010). Once secreted, IFNs act in a paracine/autocrine fashion through cell surface IFN receptors, leading to the induction of hundreds of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) via the Jak-STAT pathway (Sen, 2001, Stark et al., 1998). Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the biological functions of a number of ISGs, much remains to be learned about the role of the majority of ISGs in innate antiviral defense. Apart from inducing cellular genes with direct antiviral effects, IFNs also regulate activation of professional immune cells, shaping subsequent adaptive immunity to virus infections (Sen, 2001, Stark et al., 1998, Yoneyama and Fujita, 2010).",

Among the latter the RNase L pathway represents a principal component of IFN's antiviral effector mechanisms. A latent, ubiquitous endonuclease, RNase L is activated by short oligoadenylates produced by the IFN-inducible, 2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetases following viral infection. Activated RNase L exerts direct antiviral effect by cleaving and degrading viral RNAs. It also cleaves cellular 18S and 28S rRNAs, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and cellular apoptosis, thereby preventing viral propagation (Silverman, 2007). RNase L-deficient mice have enhanced susceptibility to infections by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Coxsackievirus, herpes simplex virus 1 and West Nile virus (Flodstrom-Tullberg et al., 2005, Samuel et al., 2006, Zheng et al., 2001, Zhou et al., 1997). Nevertheless, analyses of mice triply deficient for the three well-characterized antiviral pathways, PKR, RNase L, and Mx demonstrated the presence of alternative effector mechanisms which mediate IFN's antiviral actions (Zhou et al., 1999).",

            "text": "The IFN-stimulated gene 20 kDa protein (ISG20) has recently emerged as a second IFN-regulated RNase that inhibits RNA virus replication (Degols et al., 2007). ISG20, along with the closely related ISG20L1 (a.k.a., apoptosis-enhancing nuclease, AEN) and ISG20L2, belongs to the yeast RNA exonuclease 4 homolog (REX4) subfamily within the DEDDh exonuclease family (Coute et al., 2008). Proteins of this family can have both RNase and DNase activities; all have a large structurally related, 150-aa long exonuclease domain (ExoIII) that contains three distinct exonuclease motifs termed Exo I, Exo II and Exo III defined by four conserved acidic amino acids, DEDD and a conserved histidine residue (Degols et al., 2007). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that ISG20 is a 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease that has a preference for single-stranded (ss) RNA over ssDNA (Nguyen et al., 2001). When overexpressed in vitro, ISG20 restricted infections by EMCV, vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus, HIV and Sindbis virus, although the antiviral efficiencies varied (Espert et al., 2003, Espert et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2007). ISG20 also inhibited the replication of subgenomic, genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replicons in HEK293 cells (Jiang et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The mechanism underlying the antiviral action of ISG20 remains poorly understood, as does its viral specificity (Degols et al., 2007). The former is believed to involve degradation of viral RNAs by means of the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity of ISG20, although possible actions on cellular factors cannot be excluded (Degols et al., 2007). The antiviral action of ISG20 is thought to operate poorly on double stranded regions, as the RNase activity of ISG20 is negatively regulated by the presence of a stem-loop structure at the 3\u2032end of the RNA substrate (Nguyen et al., 2001). However, only a small number of RNA viruses have been tested thus far, precluding a better understanding of the specificity and mechanism of action of ISG20. Furthermore, it is not known whether the antiviral effect is shared by other exonucleases that are closely related to ISG20. In this study, we have compared in cell culture the effects of ISG20 on replication of several positive-strand RNA viruses from distinct viral families, including Flaviviridae [HCV, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and yellow fever virus (YFV)], Piconaviridae [hepatitis A virus (HAV)] and Coronaviridae [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)]. We show that (1) ISG20 inhibits replication of genotype 2a subgenomic HCV RNAs and cell culture derived HCV, and that of HAV in cultured hepatoma cells; (2) ISG20 restricts BVDV propagation in bovine kidney cells; (3) ISG20 demonstrates cell-type specific antiviral effect against YFV, a classical flavivirus; (4) ISG20 does not inhibit SARS-CoV, a highly pathogenic novel human coronavirus in Huh7.5 cells; 5) the antiviral effect against HCV by ISG20 is not shared with ISG20L1 and ISG20L2. Our data characterize the antiviral activities of ISG20 against distinct positive strand RNA viruses and may help to better understand the specificity and action of ISG20 in IFN-mediated antiviral innate immunity.",

Huh7.5 cells represent an Huh7 subline that is highly permissive for HCV replication (Blight et al., 2002). In addition, Huh7 derived cells are susceptible to many RNA viruses of distinct viral families (Devaraj et al., 2007, Guix et al., 2007, Hattermann et al., 2005, Keskinen et al., 1999, Lohmann et al., 1999, Muller et al., 2007, Tang et al., 2005, Yi and Lemon, 2002). By establishing Huh7.5 cells stably expressing ISG20/ISG20m, we were able to evaluate the effect of this ISG on replication of many different viruses. To eliminate phenotypic differences derived from variations among individual cell clones, we utilized stable cell pools instead of clonal cell lines. The ectopically expressed ISG20 (Fig. 1A) and ISG20m (data not shown) were distributed in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and could be readily detected in 7.5-ISG20 and 7.5-ISG20m cells by immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed either against the myc epi-tag that was introduced at the C-terminus of ISG20 (Fig. 1B, upper panel) or against the ISG20 protein itself (lower panel), but not in the control vector expressing 7.5-Bsr cells. Although they were stably expressed at high levels (Fig. 1C), ISG20 and ISG20m did not alter growth characteristics of Huh7.5 cells (Fig. 1D, compare 7.5-ISG20 and 7.5-ISG20m vs 7.5-Bsr cells), nor did they affect the RIG-I signaling defect in Huh7.5 cells (Sumpter et al., 2005) as determined by the absence of ISG56 induction following Sendai virus infection, irrespective of ISG20/ISG20m expression status (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 3, 5, and 7 vs 9).",

We constructed a monocistronic subgenomic JFH1 RNA replicon, SGRm-JFH1BlaRL, in which the coding sequences for most of the HCV structural proteins (core-E1-E2-p7) and NS2 were replaced by cDNA sequences encoding the blasticidin resistance gene product directly fused to the N-terminus of Renilla luciferase, FMDV autoprotease and ubiquitin, with the latter two directing processing at the N-terminus of NS3 (Fig. 2A). SGRm-JFH1BlaRL RNA, but not the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase defective GND mutant, replicated continuously and robustly in transfected Huh7.5 cells, expressing renilla luciferase as a measure of viral RNA amplification (Data not shown). SGRm-JFH1BlaRL replicated efficiently with similar kinetics in 7.5-Bsr and 7.5-ISG20m cells, reaching a plateau at 48 to 96 h posttransfection (Fig. 2A). In contrast, its replication was severely impaired in 7.5-ISG20 cells. At all time points examined, the replication levels of SGRm-JFH1BlaRL RNA were always 5- to 10-fold lower than those in 7.5-Bsr and 7.5-ISG20m cells (Fig. 2A).

To determine whether ISG20 promotes HCV RNA degradation, we determined the stability of modified subgenomic HCV RNAs encoding a luciferase reporter gene and also containing a lethal mutation in the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Fig. 3A). Upon introduction into cells, these HCV RNAs express Renilla (SGRm-JFH1BlaRL/GND) or firefly (NmLuc/\u0394GDD) luciferases directed by HCV IRES (SGRm-JFH1BlaRL/GND) or EMCV IRES (NmLuc/\u0394GDD), respectively. The luciferase activity serves as a read-out for HCV RNA abundance. Due to the inability of these HCV RNAs to replicate, the decay rate in luciferase activity represents the rate of HCV RNA degradation. After electroporation into cells, the non-replicating JFH1 strain (genotype 2a) SGRm-JFH1BlaRL/GND RNA was degraded rapidly in the first 12 h, followed by a further slow decay in the next 9 h, when the luciferase activity dropped to background level. There was no appreciable difference among 7.5-Bsr, 7.5-ISG20 and 7.5-ISG20m cells (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained when the replication-incompetent NmLuc/\u0394GDD RNA (HCV-N strain, genotype 1b) was used in lieu of SGRm-JFH1BlaRL/GND RNA (Fig. 3C).

In contrast, we did not observe increased permissiveness for JFH1 virus RNA replication (Fig. 2A) or JFH1 infection (Fig. 2B) when comparing 7.5-ISG20m and 7.5-Bsr cells. This lack of DN effect of ISG20m was most likely due to the absence of detectable basal ISG20 protein expression in Huh7.5 derived cells (Fig. 1B, lower panel). To determine whether ISG20m inhibits the anti-HCV activity of IFN (which induces ISG20 expression), we pretreated 7.5-Bsr and 7.5-ISG20m cells with a high concentration of human IFN-\u03b1 (1000 U/ml) to induce a cellular antiviral state. IFN was then removed and cells were transfected with SGRm-JFH1BlaRL replicon RNA to determine the kinetics of intracellular HCV RNA replication (Fig. 4A). In the absence of IFN pretreatment, both 7.5-Bsr and 7.5-ISG20m cells supported robust HCV RNA replication, which reached plateau at 48\u201372 h posttransfection. There was no appreciable difference between the two cell populations. IFN pretreatment strongly suppressed SGRm-JFH1BlaRL RNA replication in both 7.5-Bsr and 7.5-ISG20m cells, but was substantially less effective in 7.5-ISG20m cells than in 7.5-Bsr cells. At 48 and 72 h posttransfection, HCV RNA replication was reduced by IFN pretreatment by 427-fold and 68-fold, respectively, in 7.5-Bsr cells, but was only decreased by 91-fold and 16-fold, respectively in 7.5-ISG20m cells (Fig. 4A). This difference could not be attributed to an impaired response through Jak-STAT signaling to IFN in 7.5-ISG20m cells, as IFN induction of two well-characterized ISGs, ISG56 and MxA, was of similar efficiency in 7.5-ISG20m cells compared with 7.5-Bsr cells (Fig. 4C). In aggregate, these data suggest that ISG20 is a significant contributor to the IFN antiviral action against intracellular HCV RNA replication, and that this is inhibited by ISG20m.",

Towards this end, we pretreated 7.5-Bsr and 7.5-ISG20m cells with a range of IFN-\u03b1 concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25 and 100 U/ml) to induce a cellular antiviral state. IFN was then removed and cells were infected with JFH1 virus at an MOI of 0.05. At 48 h postinfection, culture supernatants were examined for infectious progeny virus yields by FFU assay (Fig. 4B). We found that pretreatment of cells with as low as 5 U/ml of IFN-\u03b1 was able to reduce infectious JFH1 virus production by 40%, with no obvious further reduction at higher IFN concentrations. Of note, the reduction of progeny virus yields by IFN pretreatment did not differ between 7.5-Bsr and 7.5-ISG20m cells, regardless of the IFN concentrations used. This suggests that ISG20 mediated inhibition of intracellular HCV RNA replication represents only a fraction of IFN's effects against HCV infection. Conceivably, IFN may also target various steps in HCV life cycle other than intracellular HCV RNA replication, such as viral entry, uncoating, packaging and release, etc (Stark et al., 1998), which may not be targeted by ISG20's exonuclease activity. Such antiviral mechanisms may not be competed by the ectopically expressed ISG20m.",

Both proteins have an ExoIII exonuclease domain highly similar to that of ISG20 within their C-terminal portions (Fig. 5A). However, unlike ISG20 which is only composed of an ExoIII domain, ISG20L1 and ISG20L2 have additional N-terminal sequences of 108 and 177 aa, respectively. The function of the N-terminal part of ISG20L1 and ISG20L2 is poorly understood, but could determine the predominant nuclear localization of these two proteins (Coute et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2005). In agreement with these previous studies, we found that both ISG20L1 and ISG20L2 were expressed exclusively within the nucleus of transfected Huh7.5 cells, resembling a nuclear body localization pattern (Fig. 5B). To determine whether these two ISG20-like proteins have antiviral activity against HCV, we attempted to establish Huh7.5 cells stably expressing ISG20L1 and ISG20L2, respectively, using retroviral mediated gene transfer. We were able to generate stable Huh7.5 pools expressing ISG20L1 (Fig. 5C). However, efforts to obtain ISG20L2 expressing cells have been unsuccessful thus far\u2014virtually no cells survived the selection process after infection of ISG20L2-encoding retroviruses.

It has been the most widely used in vitro surrogate model system for the identification and characterization of antiviral agents for use against HCV (Buckwold et al., 2003) before the HCV cell culture system became available. Since ISG20 suppresses HCV RNA replication, we asked the question whether replication of the closely related BVDV is also subject to the inhibitory action of ISG20. Toward this end, we established MBDK cell pools stably expressing ISG20 (designated as BK-ISG20), ISG20m (designated as BK-ISG20m) and the control vector (designated as BK-Bsr), respectively, by retroviral mediated gene transfer. In contrast to the control BK-Bsr cells, BK-ISG20 and BK-ISG20m cells expressed abundant myc-tagged ISG20 or ISG20m protein (Figs. 6A and B), which demonstrated both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (Fig. 6A), a pattern similar to that observed for ISG20 in human cells (Fig. 1A) (Espert et al., 2003, Espert et al., 2006). When infected with the cytopathic BVDV NADL virus at a range of increasing MOIs (0.0003 to 0.3), BK-ISG20 cells had substantially less CPE and more cell survival than did BK-ISG20m cells (Fig. 6C). In agreement with this, progeny BVDV yields from infected BK-ISG20 cells were consistently about 1-log lower than those in BK-Bsr and BK-ISG20m cells at 48 and 72 h postinfection, with the latter two being similar (MOI = 0.01 and 0.001, shown in Fig. 6D). We conclude from these experiments that similar to HCV, BVDV is also sensitive to the antiviral action of ISG20 in cell culture.",

Cells were cultured to induce (+ tet) or repress (\u2212tet) ISG20 or ISG20m expression, followed by infection with YFV-17D virus (MOI = 0.1) for 4 days. YFV-17D grew at a much slower rate in HEK293 cells than it did in Huh7.5-derived cells, with progeny virus in culture supernatant first detected at 48 h post-infection (Fig. 7D). We found that induction of ISG20, but not ISG20m, reduced progeny YFV production by 2\u20133 logs at 48 to 96 h post-infection (Fig. 7D). Consistent with this, accumulation of YFV NS3 antigen was diminished in HEK293 cells expressing ISG20 (Fig. 7E, compare lanes 5 and 6 vs 2 and 3) but not in cells induced for ISG20m expression (Fig. 7E, compare lanes 11 and 12 vs 8 and 9).

            "text": "HAV is a picornavirus that infects mainly hepatocytes, causing acute hepatitis in vivo (Martin and Lemon, 2006). To determine whether ISG20 inhibits HAV replication, we first compared the replication efficiency of a subgenomic HAV RNA replicon encoding luciferse (HAV-Luc, Fig. 8A) among 7.5-Bsr, 7.5-ISG20, and 7.5\u2013ISG20m cells. HAV-Luc replicated efficiently in both 7.5-Bsr and 7.5-ISG20m cells with similar kinetics, resulting in an increase in luciferase activity over 72 h followed by a plateau later. In contrast, replication of HAV-Luc was substantially compromised in 7.5-ISG20 cells, resulting 5- to 7-fold lower luciferase activity than that observed with 7.5-Bsr and 7.5-ISG20m cells 72\u201396 h posttransfection (Fig. 8B). These results suggest that ISG20 expression restricts HAV RNA replication in Huh7.5 cells. To determine whether ISG20 inhibits HAV replication in the context of virus infection, HEK293 FLP-IN T-Rex cells with tet-regulated expression of ISG20 or ISG20m were cultured to induce (+ tet) or repress (\u2212tet) ISG20 or ISG20m expression (Fig. 8C), followed by infection with HAV-18f virus for 5 days. Induction of ISG20 was associated with a reproducible, 2-fold reduction in progeny HAV yield, while no such effect was observed upon ISG20m expression (Fig. 8D). Collectively, ISG20 inhibits HAV replication in both hepatic and non-hepatic cells and the anti-HAV effect is dependent on the exonuclease activity of ISG20.",

Unlike other known human coronaviruses which are usually associated with mild upper respiratory tract infection, infection with SARS-CoV causes severe lower respiratory illness with a mortality rate of ~ 10% (Peiris et al., 2004, Peiris et al., 2003). Although there is no specific antiviral therapy available for treatment of SARS, IFN is known to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro and protect against SARS-CoV infection in vivo (Cinatl et al., 2003, Haagmans et al., 2004, Spiegel et al., 2004, Zheng et al., 2004). Since ISG20 was highly upregulated in lungs of cynomolgus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV (de Lang et al., 2007), we set out to determine whether ISG20 contributes to the antiviral action of IFN against SARS-CoV, taking advantage of the fact that SARS-CoV replicates in Huh7 cells (Devaraj et al., 2007, Hattermann et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2005). When infected at a low MOI (0.01), 7.5-Bsr, 7.5-ISG20 and 7.5-ISG20m cells released similar amount of progeny viruses in culture medium at all time points during the 3-day observation period (Fig. 9A). Consistent with this, intracellular accumulation of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was comparable among these cell populations, regardless of the ISG20/ISG20m expression status (Fig. 9B). These data reveal that ISG20 does not inhibit SARS-CoV replication in hepatoma Huh7.5 cells.",

It is demonstrated in the current study that ISG20 also inhibits HAV, BVDV and cell culture derived HCV (JFH1 virus). Furthermore, we report that ISG20 exhibits cell-type specific antiviral activity against YFV infection (Fig. 7)\u2014while ISG20 had no demonstrable anti-YFV effect in Huh7.5-derived cells, it potently inhibited YFV replication in HEK293 cells. The latter result is in line with a very recent report which demonstrated that ISG20 inhibited infections by two closely related flaviviruses to YFV, West Nile virus and Dengue virus, when ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells (Jiang et al., 2010). At present, we do not know what cellular factor(s) contributes to the disparate anti-YFV activity of ISG20 between Huh7.5 and HEK293 cells. Nonetheless, our data suggests the need for caution when interpreting results obtained from different cell types. Thus, although we did not observe an antiviral effect of ISG20 on propagation of SARS-CoV in Huh7.5 cells (Fig. 9), further studies are needed to determine whether this holds true in other cell types that support efficient SARS-CoV replication.",

The current study shows that ISG20 also acts to inhibit the replication of genotype 2a (JFH1) subgenomic replicon as well as propagation of cell culture-derived HCV (JFH1 virus) in cultured hepatocytes. Furthermore, our results show that ectopically expressed ISG20 inhibits HCV RNA replication and progeny virus release in Huh7.5 cells that lack both RIG-I and TLR3 viral RNA sensing pathways which recognize HCV replication and trigger IFN antiviral responses (Li et al., 2005a, Saito et al., 2008, Sumpter et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2009). Therefore, the antiviral action of ISG20 against HCV infection does not seem to depend on an IFN-inducible factor. This is in contrast to what has been shown for the zinc-finger antiviral protein, an ISG that requires an IFN-induced factor to inhibit alphavirus virion production (MacDonald et al., 2007). However, our results do not rule out the possibility that one or more IFN-stimulated cellular factors may enhance the antiviral activity of ISG20.",

The currently proposed effector mechanism of ISG20 involves the degradation of viral RNAs by the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity of ISG20 (Degols et al., 2007). However, precisely how ISG20 acts to inhibit HCV, HAV, YFV and BVDV infection is not known. Our results show that ISG20 does not enhance the degradation of transfected HCV RNA, regardless of the virus strains (JFH1, genotype 2a and HCV-N, genotype 1b) tested (Fig. 3A\u2013C). While this is a little surprising, it is possible that ISG20 exerts its antiviral action by targeting a cellular factor(s) required for virus replication (Degols et al., 2007). However, it is also possible that ISG20 only recognizes HCV RNAs which are associated with replication complex and/or reside in certain cellular compartments. It should be noted that our RNA stability data (Fig. 3A\u2013C) were from replication defective RNAs and hence gave no information on whether ISG20 promotes the degradation of negative strand HCV RNA, which could constitute an antiviral mechanism of ISG20. We show that ISG20 does not affect HCV IRES-mediated translation (Fig. 3E), an essential step before HCV proteins, including the nonstructural proteins involved in viral RNA replication, are made. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ectopically expressed, D94G mutant ISG20 suppresses IFN's antiviral effect on replication of subgenomic HCV RNAs in hepatoma cells (Fig. 4A), indicating that ISG20 is a critical component in executing IFN's antiviral actions against HCV RNA replication in hepatocytes. Conceivably, the catalytically-inactive ISG20 mutant may act as a DN inhibitor that competes with ISG20 in recognizing/associating with the viral/cellular substrate(s). When JFH1 virus was used in probing IFN's antiviral action, the DN effect of the D94G mutant ISG20 was not as evident (Fig. 4B). This is not surprising, as IFN likely targets multiple stages of HCV life cycle which are not recapitulated in the HCV RNA replicon system and are probably not subjected to ISG20's action, such as viral attachment, entry, uncoating, packaging, and egress, etc.",

Both share a highly similar EXOIII domain with ISG20, with amino acid identities of 57% (ISG20L1) and 51% (ISG20L2) compared with ISG20, respectively. The biological functions of these two ISG20-like proteins are not well understood. ISG20L1 (a.k.a., AEN) is induced by p53 following ionizing radiation and DNA damage and is required for efficient DNA fragmentation in p53-dependent apoptosis (Lee et al., 2005). ISG20L2 is involved in ribosome biogenesis at the level of 5.8S rRNA maturation, more specifically in the processing of the 12S precursor rRNA (Coute et al., 2008). Our data analyzing HCV RNA replication efficiencies in hepatoma cells ectopically expressing ISG20L1 or ISG20L2 did not reveal an antiviral function of these two ISG20-like proteins, at least against HCV (Fig. 5). While there may be intrinsic differences in substrate preference of ISG20L1 and ISG20L2 from that of ISG20, it is of note that ISG20L1 and ISG20L2 localize within nucleus (Fig. 5B) (Coute et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2005), whereas ISG20 is distributed in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1, Fig. 6) (Espert et al., 2003, Espert et al., 2006). It is possible that ISG20L1 and ISG20L2 do not have access to HCV RNA and/or cellular factors essential for HCV replication, which are targeted by ISG20.",

In the liver of chimpanzees acutely infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), ISG20 was induced during the viral clearance stage (Wieland et al., 2004). Interestingly, ISG20, when ectopically expressed in HepG2 cells, reduces the secretion of HBs and HBe antigens in transfected HepG2 cells (Hao and Yang, 2008). The broad antiviral activities of ISG20 against multiple, distinct hepatitis viruses (HAV, HCV and HBV) indicate that ISG20 is an important antiviral effector molecule downstream of IFN signaling in innate defenses of the liver.",

To achieve this, the EcoRI\u2013MluI fragment containing the entire 5\u2032NTR and the first 19 core-coding sequences in pFL-J6/JFH-5\u2032C19Rluc2AUbi was replaced with a similarly digested fragment amplified by PCR from pSGR-JFH1-blast (kindly provided by G. Luo) (Chang et al., 2006) using the primers, EcoRIT7+, cagtgaattctaatacgactcactatag, and MluIBlanostop\u2212, gtcatacgcgtGCCCTCCCACACATAAC. The resulting plasmid was named as pJ6JFH1BlaRL. Subsequently, QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis was conducted to remove the HCV Core-E1-E2-p7-NS2 coding sequences downstream of the ubiquitin sequence, leading to a direct fusion of N-terminus of NS3 to ubiquitin. The resulting plasmid was digested with AgeI and AvrII to release the cDNA fragment (hereafter referred as fragment L) containing partial 5\u2032NTR, the first 12 aa coding sequence of Core, the blasticidin resistance gene, full Renilla luciferase coding sequence, FMDV 2a autoprotease sequence, ubiquitin and partial NS3 coding sequence. pSGR-JFH1 (Kato et al., 2003) (kindly provided by T. Wakita) was digested with AgeI and AvrII to remove the partial 5\u2032NTR, the first 19 aa coding sequence of Core, the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene, EMCV IRES and partial NS3 coding sequence, and used as a vector for ligation with fragment L to generate the monocistronic replicon, pSGRmJFH1BlaRL. A replication defective mutant replicon, pSGRmJFH1BlaRL/GND, was constructed the same way except that pSGR-JFH1/GND was used as the vector backbone for ligation with fragment L. The fragment L in both constructs was fully sequenced to confirm its authenticity. A monocistronic, replication defective mutant replicon of HCV-N strain, NmLuc/\u0394GDD, was constructed by replacing the cDNA fragment containing the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene and EMCV IRES in NNeo/3-5B/\u0394GDD (Ikeda et al., 2002) with a cDNA cassette containing EMCV IRES, firefly luciferase gene and FMDV 2a autoprotease, with the latter directly fused to the N-terminus of NS3.

HEK293 FLP-IN T-Rex cells expressing ISG20 and mutant ISG20 were cultured as described (Jiang et al., 2008). Huh7.5 and MDBK cells stably expressing ISG20, the catalytically inactive mutant ISG20, ISG20L1, or the control vector were established by transducing cells with replication incompetent retroviruses encoding WT (pCX4Bsr-ISG20-myc), D94G mutant ISG20 (pCX4Bsr-ISG20m-myc), ISG20L1 (pCX4Bsr-ISG20L1), or the empty pCX4bsr vector, respectively, followed by selection with 5 \u03bcg/ml of blasticidin (Invivogen) for ~ 3 weeks, as described previously (Chen et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2009). Replicon RNAs were transfected into Huh7.5 derived cells using DMRIE-C transfection reagent (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 5 \u03bcg of lipid to 1 \u03bcg of RNA, as described (Lanford et al., 2003). DNA transfection of Huh7.5 derived cells was conducted using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) per manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, replicon RNAs and plasmids were cotransfected into Huh7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 as suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen).",

(F) Huh7 cells were transiently co-transfected with SGRm-JFH1BlaRL replicon RNA and an empty vector or plasmid encoding ISG20, ISG20L1, or ISG20L2, respectively, at a ratio of 1:6 using lipofectamine 2000. Replication of SGRm-JFH1RL replicon was determined by calculating the fold increase of luciferase activities at 72 h over those at 6 h posttransfection (upper panel). In lower panel, expression of ISG20, ISG20L1 and ISG20L2 proteins were analyzed by western blot using anti-myc mAb. Actin was immunoblotted to demonstrate equal sample loading.",
