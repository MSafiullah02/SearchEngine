However, the results were similar to an Indian study done at Ballabgarh which reported a positivity of 17.3 per cent during the pandemic period17. The increased positivity of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 during post-pandemic period in the present study may be due to survival of the virus for prolonged period due to climatic conditions.",

The presence of RSV in the present study was found to be low (4.41%) when compared with other studies reporting 13.1-21.3 per cent220 in patients with different degrees of respiratory illness and acute LRI. The reason might be due to low number of children enrolled in the age group of 0-12 months as RSV infection was more common in them. Further, use of throat swab only for collecting samples might have limited the detection of RSV. Addition of nasopharyngeal swab could have increased the yield21.",

Other rare viruses such as influenza C, cytomegalovirus may also be tested in samples negative for the first panel.
