I graduated from the University of Virginia School of Medicine in 1956. That same year, Dr William Mogabgab, working at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, reported the discovery of the first rhinovirus strain, 2060, later numbered as rhinovirus type 1A. (Pelon et al., 1957) Earlier, there had been important epidemiologic studies into colds conducted in England by Drs Christo-pher Andrewes and David Tyrrell and in the US, but these studies were seriously hampered by a lack of virology (Frost and Gover, 1932; Andrewes, 1965; Dingle et al., 1964) . The discovery of rhinovirus added greatly to the ability of investigators to study colds and also became an important influence on my career. Following a residency in Internal Medicine at Case Western Reserve University, I entered the US Army Medical Corps in 1960 and was stationed at Fort Dix, NJ where I was responsible for the care of many hundreds of recruits with adenovirus ARD. There I observed the research that was being conducted on ARD by Drs Harry Rose of Columbia University and Edward Busher of Walter Reed Army Institute of Research using the new and exciting technique of tissue culture. In 1962, I returned to the University of Virginia to join Dr William Jordan, an author of the highly regarded Cleveland Family Study of Minor Illnesses in the Home. Dr. Jordan had moved to Charlottesville to Chair the Department of Preventive Medicine and was continuing to conduct research on the common cold. During this period, Dr Leonard Hayflick of the Wistar Institute developed the WI 26 strain of human embryonic lung cells which were found to grow rhinovirus very efficiently and were ideal for epidemiologic studies (Hayflick and Moorehead, 1961) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 481, "end": 501, "text": "(Pelon et al., 1957)", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 716, "end": 739, "text": "(Frost and Gover, 1932;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 740, "end": 755, "text": "Andrewes, 1965;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 756, "end": 776, "text": "Dingle et al., 1964)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1910, "end": 1940, "text": "(Hayflick and Moorehead, 1961)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Dr Jordan and I began a study of acute respiratory disease in the approximately 500 employees of the Eastern Regional Office of the State Farm Insurance Company. This work was supported by the Commission on Acute Respiratory Disease of the Armed Forces Epidemiology Board and the Vaccine Development Branch of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The insurance employees maintained daily symptom records and supplied specimens for viral culture and serology. The study eventually continued for 15 years. A nurse monitored the employees on a weekly schedule to ensure accurate recording of data. In this study, which employed cell culture for viral identification, rhinovirus accounted for 25% of colds, giving a rate of 0.77 rhinovirus colds per person per year . This attack rate was consistent with that of an earlier study of young adults conducted in Chicago by Dr Dorothy Hamre (Hamre et al., 1966) . The age-specific rates of infection were higher in children than in adults. A seasonal variation in rhinovirus attack rates was also observed in the Charlottesville population which resulted in a consistent large fall peak of illness associated with rhinovirus. Of interest, this yearly rhinovirus outbreak coincided in time with a recurrent peak of respiratory illness identified 20 years earlier by Dr Wade Hampton Frost, a graduate of the University of Virginia and the first Dean of the School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.

Rhinovirus serotyping was eventually done using 10 serum pools put together in a combinatorial system and new serotypes were identified in Charlottesville (Gwaltney et al., 1968) . Epidemiologic studies in the US and England lead to the discovery of many new rhinovirus serotypes, the number eventually reaching 100 (Kapikian et al., 1967 (Kapikian et al., , 1971 Hamparian et al., 1987) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 293, "end": 309, "text": "(Gwaltney, 1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 467, "end": 490, "text": "(Gwaltney et al., 1968)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 628, "end": 650, "text": "(Kapikian et al., 1967", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 651, "end": 675, "text": "(Kapikian et al., , 1971", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 676, "end": 699, "text": "Hamparian et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In 1970, I recruited Dr J. Owen Hendley who joined me in the work. With the availability of viral serotyping, an earlier attempt had been made to trace the spread of individual virus types through the insurance company population. It became clear that the different strains did not typically spread among people who were working together in the same area of the office. This suggested that the employees were becoming infected at home. As a result, we turned our attention to rhinovirus spread among families of employees in their homes (Hendley et al., 1969) . This work led to the finding that children were usually the first to develop rhinovirus colds in the family as a result of exposure at school. The sick child then transmitted the infection to other family members. Also, serologic findings from this study when combined with data from a study of experimentally infected volunteers revealed the levels of neutralizing antibody that were necessary to protect against infection following natural exposure (Hendley et al., 1972) . Now that it was clear that certain, as yet undetermined, conditions in the home promoted spread of rhinovirus in the family, we turned our attention to trying to understand what these conditions were. The first evidence bearing on rhinovirus transmission came about through serendipity. While conducting an earlier study on the appearance of the nasal mucosa in infected and uninfected subjects using a dissecting microscope to view the nose, I observed that infection had accidentally spread to control subjects by way of contaminated nasal specula. This focused attention on the possible mechanisms for accidental introduction of virus directly into the nose by the types of intimate activities that take place among family members. It was discovered that cold patients with rhinovirus in their nasal secretions also frequently had virus on their fingers (Hendley et al., 1973) . When these same patients sneezed or coughed onto petri dishes containing viral collecting broth which was then cultured, virus was infrequently recovered. This directed attention away from viral spread by large and small particle aerosol and to the importance of contaminated hands. We then conducted experiments in which subjects' hands were intentionally contaminated with rhinovirus, following which it was observed that virus could be efficiently transferred to the hands of other subjects by brief hand-to-hand contact. Rhinovirus on the skin of the fingers was shown to be readily transferred to the mucous membranes of the nose or the eye by means of finger contact with these sites. Rhinovirus was also found to survive well on human skin and environmental surfaces. Finally, the number of finger-to-nose and finger-to-eye contacts which occurred naturally in routine activities such as medical grand rounds and Sunday school class were recorded.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 537, "end": 559, "text": "(Hendley et al., 1969)", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1035, "text": "(Hendley et al., 1972)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1917, "text": "(Hendley et al., 1973)", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A more elaborate set of experiments was then planned to further explore the feasibility of the hand-contact/self-inoculation route of rhinovirus transmission . In this work, subjects (donors) were experimentally infected with rhinovirus and then exposed to other susceptible volunteers (recipients) by one of three types of exposure. In the first type of exposure, the donors and recipients had brief hand-to-hand contact following which the donors touched their nasal and conjunctival mucosa. In the second type of exposure, recipients were exposed to donors across a small table while the donors coughed, talked loudly and sang in an effort to create a large particle aerosol. In the third type of exposure, the donors and recipients were housed continuously for 3 days in the same room, separated by a double wire partition that allowed transmission of small particle aerosols throughout the room. Eleven of 15, 1 of 12, and none of 10 recipients in the respective types of exposure became infected. These findings demonstrated that under the controlled conditions of the experiment, small and large particle aerosols were considerably less efficient in the spread of rhinovirus than exposure by the hand-contact/self-inoculation route.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "With hand contact implicated as a possible route of rhinovirus transmission, prevention became the next issue of interest. Studies were conducted in which rhinovirus was applied to subjects' hands and the hands were then treated with a variety of different types of commonly used sterilizing agents . Washing the hands with soap and water was found to effectively remove rhinovirus. However, most of the chemical agents tested did not provide the desired long-lasting virucidal activity on the skin. Solutions with low concentrations of elemental iodine were found to be the most effective and were able to keep hands sterile for up to 4 h (Carter et al., 1980) . Using iodine hand treatment as a method of prevention, a controlled blinded contact prophylaxis study was then done in which mothers of families were instructed to use iodine to treat their hands on a regular basis when a family member was recognized as having a new cold (Hendley and Gwaltney, 1988) . A control group of mothers treated their hands with a solution containing brown food dye with a small non-virucidal amount of iodine. Approximately 50 families were studied each year from 1979 through 1982. Four of 58 (7%) of mothers in the iodine hand treatment group compared to 16 of 79 (20%) of those in the placebo group developed colds after exposure to an index case of the common cold. None of 11 of the iodine treated patients compared to 5 of 16 (31%) of placebo patients became infected with the rhinovirus type that was introduced into the home by the index case. By interrupting viral transmission by treating the hands, it was demonstrated that the hand contact/self-inoculation route of rhinovirus transmission was not only feasible but occurred under natural conditions . Thus, it appeared that accidental rhinovirus introduction into the nose could be prevented by hand washing and avoidance of finger-to-nose and finger-to-eye contact and was probably of practical value in avoiding colds.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 640, "end": 661, "text": "(Carter et al., 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 936, "end": 964, "text": "(Hendley and Gwaltney, 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the 1980s, we also began studies on the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds (Turner and Gwaltney, 1984) . It was well known that rhinovirus resulted in an obvious cytopathic effect in cells in cell culture, and it was assumed that similar changes occurred in the human nasal mucosa of persons with colds, although pathogenic events in humans had received little attention. In 1970, Dr Gordon Douglas had made the important discovery that the amount of rhinovirus required to infect a human was very small. One human infectious dose 50 of rhinovirus could be as little as one tissue culture infectious dose 50 (Douglas and Couch, 1969) . Another important finding to emerge from the rhinovirus challenge experiments in Charlottesville and elsewhere was that in susceptible (antibody-free) people, the nose has virtually no protection against the virus once it was deposited on the nasal mucosa. For example, in Charlottesville, an infection occurred in 95% of 243 antibody-free subjects who were challenged intranasally with rhinovirus . Of interest, only 74% of the infected subjects developed symptoms of a cold. A similar rate of inapparent infection had been observed with natural rhinovirus infection (Gwaltney, 1997) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 76, "end": 103, "text": "(Turner and Gwaltney, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 609, "end": 634, "text": "(Douglas and Couch, 1969)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1221, "text": "(Gwaltney, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "As work on rhinovirus pathogenesis progressed, it was determined that the initial step of virus introduction into the nose or the eye (from where it goes down the lacrimal duct into the nose) was followed by transport of the virus to the posterior pharynx (adenoid) by the ciliary epithelium of the nasal mucus membrane (Winther et al., 1986) . Dr Birgit Winther, who had joined the Charlottesville group, and Dr Niels Mygind of Copenhagen were lead investigators in this work. Infection then appeared to be initiated in the posterior pharynx in the lymphoepithelial cells which are present in the crypts of adenoidal tissue. These cells were shown to be rich in ICAM-1, the major cellular receptor for rhinovirus (Winther et al., 1997) . In another experiment designed to investigate the time sequence of rhinovirus infection, production of new virus in the upper airway was shown to occur rapidly after viral inoculation into the nose with new virus being recognized within 8-10 h after intranasal inoculation (Harris and Gwaltney, 1996) . Symptoms were also observed to begin early, within 10-12 h after viral inoculation. These findings indicated that to achieve optimum benefit from treatment for rhinovirus colds, dosing should be started as early as possible after the onset of symptoms is recognized by the affected person.

Examination of nasal biopsies showed that it was difficult, if not impossible, to detect histologic change in nasal mucosa taken from subjects with rhinovirus colds. This finding suggested that the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds was, in large part, associated with the activation of various inflammatory events in the immune system of infected persons. Over the past decade, the role of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds has received increasing attention. The investigative approach to this problem has included the measurement of mediators in the nasal fluid of persons with colds, observations on the occurrence of the different cold symptoms in volunteers after intranasal challenge with known inflammatory compounds, and attempted blockade of symptoms in infected subjects by the use of antiinflammatory compounds with known mechanisms of action. This work has led to the discovery of multiple inflammatory events which may have a role in rhinovirus pathogenesis (Gwaltney and Rueckert, 1997) . These include the inflammatory mechanisms associated with the release of histamine, kinins, prostaglandins and interleukins, and the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 215, "end": 237, "text": "(Winther et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF220"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1267, "text": "(Gwaltney and Rueckert, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The traditional treatments for colds which have been directed at symptom management have obviously worked by blocking some of the inflammatory pathways that have been recognized.

However, the results of the clinical trials have been disappointing because of the modest therapeutic effects that the antivirals have provided.

This approach showed promise in a proof of concept study and is currently my major interest (Gwaltney, 1992) .

Changing epidemiology of RSV (Larry Anderson, Centers for Disease Control and Pre6ention, Atlanta, GA) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has long been considered an important cause of serious lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children throughout the world and as such an important target for vaccine development. Over the last decade, it has also become clear that RSV is also an important pathogen in other age groups and our thinking about treatment and prevention needs to include the infant and young child, those with compromised cardiac, immune, and respiratory systems of any age, and the elderly. Unfortunately efforts to develop RSV vaccines have not yet been successful, and sporadic prevention of RSV disease is limited currently to RSV immune globulin or a humanized murine monoclonal antibody as prophylaxis for serious RSV disease in the premature infant and the infant with chronic lung disease. In the US, RSV causes yearly outbreaks that usually begin in late fall or winter and last until late winter or spring. These outbreaks occur as community and not regional or national outbreaks as illustrated by variation in timing of outbreaks in communities and differences in outbreaks strains between communities. RSV outbreaks are consistently associated with substantial increases in hospitalizations for bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children B 1 year of age. Using national hospital discharge diagnosis data and death certificate data, we estimate that RSV is associated with 73 000-126 000 bronchiolitis and pneumonia hospitalizations and 171-510 deaths in children B1 year of age each year. Community RSV outbreaks also bring a risk for nosocomial outbreaks that can be of substan-tial concern for hospitalized persons of all ages but especially in patients with compromised immune systems. Recipients of bone marrow transplant have been reported to have mortality rates over 50% with RSV pneumonia. Molecular epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that RSV nosocomial outbreaks often result from multiple introductions of distinct strains from the community.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 258, "text": "Rossmann and", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 259, "end": 302, "text": "associates in 1986, (Rossmann et al., 1985)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1091, "text": "Control and Pre6ention,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1100, "text": "Atlanta,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1104, "text": "GA)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Over the last decade the importance of RSV as a cause of serious lower respiratory infection (LRI) in elderly patients has become increasingly appreciated.

This simple method which involves detection of nucleic acid may be required to deliver the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for such tests to be truly useful for individual patient management. Along the same lines, methods to stabilize RNA, such as guanidinium in the transport media or swabs streaked onto filter paper imbedded with anti-degradation compounds, will enhance detection of viral genomes in clinical samples by PCR and enable easier and more broadly based sampling.

Finally, there is evidence of cellular damage with elevated levels of sputum LDH in patients with asthma exacerbations secondary to RSV, influenza, and rhinoviruses.

In addition, RSV lower respiratory tract disease in infancy has been associated with childhood asthmatic disease possibly because underlying asthmatic disease predisposes to RSV disease or possibly because RSV infection predisposes to asthmatic disease. This link between RSV disease and asthma raises the possibility of parallels in the pathogenesis of the two diseases.

We have recently identified two factors that contribute to the biology of RSV infection and probably pathogenesis of disease, and both are associated with the G protein. These two factors could also participate in the pathogenesis of asthmatic disease. First, the RSV G protein contains a chemokine motif, CX3C, and the G protein has properties similar to the corresponding CX3C chemokine, fractalkine (Fkn). Second, RSV, possibly through the G protein, induces the neurokinin, substance P (SP), and induction of SP is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the lung of RSV-infected mice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral infections and allergic disease (Larry Anderson)"}, {"text": "Both the RSV G protein and Fkn are large, highly glycosylated gylcoproteins that contain intracellular, transmembrane, and extracellular domains; both have heparin binding domains (HBDs); both have the CX3C motif; and both produce a transmembrane and a shorter secreted form.

It binds to the CX3C chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, as shown in binding and binding inhibition studies using 293 cells transfected with the CX3CR1 (293-CX3CR1). The percent of cells positive for G protein binding increase from 15% in 293 cells to 80% in 293-CX3CR1 transfected cells, and this increased binding was inhibited by G protein monoclonal antibodies, Fkn, anti-CX3CR1 antibodies, and a G protein peptide containing the CX3CR motif. G also blocked Fkn binding to 293 CX3CR1 cells. Interestingly, RSV binding to CX3CR1 facilitates infection of cells as indicated by plaque reduction assays. Since RSV also uses HBDs to infect cells, we first blocked the HBDs with heparin. Heparin gave a 66% reduction in plaques but the addition of G protein, G protein peptide with the CX3C motif (and not peptides without the CX3C motif), Fkn, or anti-CX3CR1 antibodies increased the reduction in RSV plaques to \\ 90%. Finally, G protein, through the CX3C motif, induces leukocyte chemotaxis in a fashion similar to Fkn. We used modified Boyden chambers to study leukocyte chemotaxis and found that 4-fold more cells migrated toward the G protein or Fkn than the media control. Fkn, anti-G but not anti-F protein monoclonal antibodies, and anti-CX3CR1 antibodies inhibited cell migration toward G. In addition, cloned expressed G protein that contained the CX3C motif induced leukocyte migration but G protein that lacked this motif did not induce leukocyte chemotaxis.

SP is a neurokinin that has linked to both asthmatic disease and RSV disease. SP is an 11 amino acid tachykinin that has a range of effects that include induction of vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, mucus secretion, and induction of immune and inflammatory responses. RSV infection increases levels of SP in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) specimens in mice and addition of SP to immune activated lymphocytes increases proliferation. When we inhibited the action of SP with anti-SP antibodies, the inflammatory response to RSV infection was decreased. This is particularly evident in studies of mice immunized with formalin-inactivated (FI) RSV vaccine. FI-RSV immunized mice mount an enhanced inflammatory response to RSV challenge. Treatment of FI-RSV-immunized mice with anti-SP antibodies blocked much of this enhanced inflammatory response as exemplified by the decrease in percent of eosinophils from 30% to 10% and polymorphonuclear cells from 18% to B1% at 2 days post challenge in BAL samples. The ability of anti-SP antibodies to decrease the inflammatory response to RSV infection suggests that these antibodies might be useful as an adjunct to antiviral treatment. The fact that anti-viral drugs and neutralizing antibodies or monoclonal antibodies are effective at decreasing viral titer but relatively ineffective at decreasing disease, raises that possibility that a substantial proportion of RSV disease results from virus-induced immune and inflammatory responses. Steroids have been considered as a means to decrease the RSV-associated inflammatory response but steriods also delay virus clearance. We found that addition of anti-SP antibodies to treatment with an RSV neutralizing F protein antibody before 2 or 6 days after RSV challenge markedly decreased the inflammatory response and did not delay virus clearance. For example, the total number of cells was decreased 2-fold within one day of administration of anti-SP antibodies. Anti-SP antibodies (or other means to block SP activity) could be an effective adjunct to anti-RSV drug or immune therapy. 5.3. Immunopathogenesis of 6accine-enhanced RSV disease (Peter Openshaw, Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, London, UK) Although immune responses to virus infections are usually protective, they can also be harmful . Inducing a strong immune response is an essential aim of vaccination, but risks disease enhancement. In infantile bronchiolitis, the most severe disease typically develops several days after the apparent onset of infection, at a time when viral titres are low or falling but inflammatory responses are at a peak.

In an analysis of about 1900 elderly with chronic lung disease over 3 seasons, we were able to show that the seasonal variation in hospitalization was not seen among patients who received an annual influenza vaccination .

Genetic approaches to influenza 6accine de6elopment (Peter Palese, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) As the genetic make-up of viruses is better understood, genetically altered influenza viruses have become available as potential vaccine candidates. Recently, the NS1 protein has been identified as a virulence factor for influenza viruses. When the protein is absent, the virus is highly attenuated as the protein is responsible for interferon antagonist activity. When grown in culture systems or in Stat-1 knock-out mice, which are unable to produce interferon, the NS1 deficient influenza virus regains wild-type virulence (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998) . As a result of these findings, several influenza virus constructs were developed with truncated NS1 genes in a PR8 influenza virus. An experiment was conducted in which mice were immunized with viruses containing either wild-type or altered NS1 genes. The mice were then challenged with wild type virus 4 weeks after immunization. Mice that were challenged after immunization with mutant virus survived (Talon et al., 2000) . Protection was not seen in mice immunized with low doses of a virus lacking the NS1 gene (3.3\u00d7 10 4 pfu vs. 1\u00d7 10 6 ). Currently studies are being planned to assess the efficacy of NS1 deficient A/Texas/91 virus-based vaccines in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 772, "end": 830, "text": "(Peter Palese, Mt.

Boosting H5N3 immunity in a primed population (IainStephenson, Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester, UK) Over the past several years, there has been heightened concern about the emergence of H5N1 influenza strains as the cause of the next influenza pandemic. Prevention of this virulent agent could best be accomplished by vaccination. A recent study was conducted to establish the utility of a novel MF59 adjuvanted vaccine. The vaccine is prepared as a MF59 oil-in-water emulsion solublized with squalene and polysorbate 80 with H5N3 surface antigen soluablized with sorbitan trioleate and citrate buffered sterile water. An observer blinded, randomized, dose-ranging study was conducted in 60 healthy young adults (Nicholson et al., 2001) . Patients received 2 intramuscular doses, 3 weeks apart, of either 7.5, 15, or 30 mg HA content of the MF59 adjuvanted or plain vaccine. Microneutralisation (MN) was tested against the H5N3 A/Duck/Singapore/97, hemagglutination inhibition was tested against A/ Beijing/262/97 (H1N1), A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) and A/Duck/Singapore/97 (H5N3), and single radial hemolysis (SRH) was tested against the A/ Duck/Singapore/97 (H5N3) and A/Hong Kong/489/97 (H5N1) viruses. These studies demonstrated that HI is insensitive for the detection of H5 antibody compared to MN and SRH. MF59 adjuvanted vaccine was well tolerated and had a greater antibody response at day 21 and 42 than unadjuvanted vaccine. A follow-up study was conducted to determine the durability of re-sponse and residual immunity at 12 months and to assess the effect of a single additional H5N3 vaccination on immune responses in the primed group. The follow-up study was unblinded and the patients received the same dosage and vaccine as they received in the initial study. MF59 adjuvanted vaccine was again well tolerated. Fifteen months after receiving the first two vaccines, there was no detectable immunity by HI or MN method, although there was a small detectable residual antibody level by SRH (greatest in the 30 mg group) in the MF59 adjuvant vaccine group only. Twenty-one days after a booster dose of vaccine, there was minimal response by HI and modest by SRH in the non-adjuvanted arm. The response was far more robust in the MF59 adjuvanted arm, with a maximum geometric mean titer of 1:32 by HI and 130 mm 2 by SRH to the H5N3. The SRH for H5N1 was nearly 90 mm 2 . The degree of response, irrespective of the method used, was higher with the booster dose at month 15 than it was after the second dose in the initial series. Finally, the number of patients who seroconverted by HI was 9/15 and 0/11 21 days after booster vaccination in the MF59 and plain vaccine groups respectively; seroconversion by SRH against H5N3 and H5N1 was 15/15 and 8/11, respectively. These two studies were able to demonstrate that the MF59 adjuvanted vaccine resulted in a greater response than the unadjuvanted vaccine and that re-vaccination at 15 months was very successful in boosting the immune response, particularly in the MF59 adjuvanted group. This data also suggests that HI responses generally underestimate the antibody response as compared to MN and SRH. 6.9. A new influenza 6accine for nasal administration using chitosan as an absorption enhancer (Roy Jennings, Sheffield Uni6ersity, Sheffield, UK) Current influenza vaccines are formulations of inactivated preparations administered parenterally, containing either the surface HA and NA proteins of the virus or whole virus particles. They are suboptimal vaccines, in that they induce immunity, at best, in only 60-90% of vaccinees, and individuals at the extremes of age respond particularly poorly. Respiratory mucosal immune responses contribute significantly to natural immunity, and a strategy for improving the current influenza vaccines may be administration of influenza vaccines via a mucosal route. In animal studies, influenza vaccines incorporating a variety of adjuvants and delivered by an intranasal route have reported good local and systemic antibody responses and protection against subsequent challenge infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 109, "text": "(IainStephenson, Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester, UK)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 722, "end": 746, "text": "(Nicholson et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 3263, "end": 3277, "text": "(Roy Jennings,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3278, "end": 3299, "text": "Sheffield Uni6ersity,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3300, "end": 3310, "text": "Sheffield,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3311, "end": 3314, "text": "UK)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Intranasal influenza 6accine update (Kristin Nichol)"}, {"text": "A new influenza vaccine that incorporates chitosan, a de-acylated form of chitin obtained from shrimp and crab shells with the current, commercially-available subunit influenza virus vaccine has recently been developed (Solvay, Weesp, Netherlands).

Advantage can be taken of these differences in developing clinical predictors of the specific viral etiology of respiratory infections. These predictors can be used in a number of ways.

At least two studies have shown that cough and fever are the most important predictors of type A and B influenza (Monto et al., 2000a; Monto and Ohmit, 1996) . Of note, the degree of temperature elevation appears to increase the likelihood of influenza in addition to correlating with the time to relief of symptoms (Monto et al., 2000b) . However, when the data again came from physician-based surveillance of all respiratory illness over periods of high and low influenza virus activity, the positive predictive value (PPV) of cough and fever was at most 40% (Carrat et al., 1999) . In contrast, demonstration that influenza transmission was occurring in the community was a prerequisite for enrollment in studies of antiviral treatment of influenza. Thus, influenza infection frequency was higher than when the entire winter season was followed. When data from the zanamivir studies were examined, it was found that the PPV of cough and fever for influenza positivity was 79%. The higher the fever, the better the predictive value. Of note, these are also the patients who benefit most from antiviral treatment. In a Canadian study similarly conducted during a period of influenza virus transmission, the PPV of cough with fever greater than 38\u00b0C was 87%.

Management and analysis of large genetic sequence data sets (Catherine Macken, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM) Over the past decade, technologic advances have allowed the sequencing of the genomes of several organisms. These sequences tend to be large and difficult to share. Recently, the Influ-enza Sequence Database (ISD) (http:// www.flu.lanl.gov/) was established at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group (T-10) to serve as a site in which influenza genomic sequences are stored, analyzed, and shared. The Influenza Sequence Database is a curated database of nucleotide and amino acid sequences. It is intended to provide the research community with easy sequence deposit and retrieval capabilities, together with tools tailored, in particular, to the analysis of HA and NA sequences. Care has been taken to remove redundant sequences and to fill in missing field data. The project began in the spring of 1998; the database now holds all influenza A, B, and C sequences that have been published in GenBank, as well as a growing number of unpublished sequences. Researchers interested in depositing any of their unpublished sequences directly into the ISD can do so via a password-protected web site or via e-mail directed to Catherine Macken, (cmacken@lanl.gov).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 654, "end": 720, "text": "(Catherine Macken, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Predicti6e 6alue of clinical presentation (Arnold Monto, Uni6ersity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI)"}, {"text": "In order to provide search and 'Blast' services that do not pull up redundant entries, all new sequences are reviewed as they are received to ensure that they are of adequate quality and completeness by comparing them to previous sequences. If two or more GenBank nucleotide records correspond to the same influenza strain and contain identical sequences, we classify all except one as a 'duplicate.' Currently, we take that protein sequence cross-referenced by the PID in a GenBank nucleotide sequence to be the primary protein sequence, if it exists. If the GenBank nucleotide sequence was not translated into a protein record, we take a protein sequence from another database: this latter event rarely occurs. In the case of a few strains, duplicates result from Table 1 Sensitivity of antigen detection tests from frozen specimens using cell culture as the gold standard structural studies, where secondary or tertiary structural information changes while the sequence does not. We classify duplicate sequences from structural studies as 'structural duplicates' of the primary protein sequence that they match. Finally, another source of duplicate record is the resequencing of a gene that was originally only partially sequenced, with more extensive coverage of the gene by the later sequencing effort. In this situation, we classify all except the longest sequence as a 'duplicate,' provided that the sequences are identical in their region of overlap. The data is stored in a relational database that allows correlation of epidemiologic, genetic, and virological information. Users can perform basic or more advanced searches, as well as two specialized functions called Region and Prosite search. Region search is an advanced search with the additional feature of allowing the user to prune returned sequences to a region of interest. Region search is based on prealigned sequences, and hence can be used to download alignments. Prosite search is another advanced search, applicable to protein sequences only, with the additional feature of identifying 'prosite' patterns. Prosite search can be used to color-code glycosylation sites, CTL epitopes, or other patterns of interest onto pre-aligned protein sequences.

New anti6irals in an era of healthcare cost containment (Thomas Szucs, Hirslanden Holding, Zurich, Switzerland) Over the past several decades, healthcare costs have increased substantially as a result of many factors including new treatments for previously untreatable conditions, new evidence to supporting broader application of existing treatments, an overall increase in the cost of treatments with greater development in areas such as biologics that are more expensive, increased intensity of treatments, quality improvement measures, and increased demand from a better educated public. These enormous growths in cost have led to renewed interest in cost containment. Increasing interest in cost containment is derived from an aging population who, as a result of anti-egalitarian trends, are paying higher co-payments for their healthcare. In addition, we observe an increasing gap between what medicines can do and what is affordable. Hand-in-hand with the increased interest has come a wider use of evidencebased medicine and technology assessment to better assess which costly interventions produce the greatest benefit. Cost containment currently focuses on price reduction, through increased competition and price controls; on demand reduction, through reimbursement limits and managed care; and on budgeting, through global healthcare budgets and, in some countries, certificates of need for drug approval.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 61, "end": 116, "text": "(Thomas Szucs, Hirslanden Holding, Zurich, Switzerland)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Antivirals and other management strategies"}, {"text": "Pharmaceuticals overall have a beneficial effect on life expectancy and total health care costs. It is also clear that there is a specific benefit from the use of antivirals, especially the NA inhibitors.

These direct costs are estimated to average $3.7 billion in Europe and $1.9 billion in the US annually. Indirectly, anti-influenza treatment can improve productivity which contributes to their cost-effectiveness. Indirect costs of influenza amount to $18 billion in Europe and $9.5 billion in the US annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness of zanamivir per symptoms-free gained day by several estimates ranges from $7.25-22.58 based on December 28, 2001 conversion data (Griffin et al., 2001; Mauskopf et al., 2000) . Unfortunately, there are no cost-effectiveness analyses that have head-to-head comparability of different therapeutic options, and none have been done with reference to quality adjusted life years (QALYs). As a result, the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) initially decided not to recommend the widespread use of zanamivir in 1999. It changed its stance in 2000, recommending zanamivir for use in at-risk adults when influenza was circulating in the community and in patients who present within 36 h of onset of illness. The potential impact of this decision, if used for all 97 000-487 000 at-risk individuals, would have yielded a cost of between \u00a32.3-11.7 million.

FLUNET \u00ae : a no6el approach for influenza management (Simon Tucker, Biota Holdings Limited, Melbourne, Australia) The FLUNET technology was established to discover new neuraminidase inhibitors with a long residence time in the respiratory tract and high potency with the ultimate goal of producing a novel drug that could be dosed once daily for treatment and once weekly for prophylaxis. Cooperative work between Biota Holdings Limited and GlaxoSmithKline lead to the design of several multimeric zanamivir molecules linked through the 7% hydroxy group. Initial testing of the dimers, trimers, and tetramers was conducted to screen for potential drugs for further development. Screening for in vitro activity against six influenza A and four influenza B viruses revealed that some dimers were extremely potent with a median EC 50 approaching 0.01 mg/ml in cell culture. Next the number of linker atoms between the two zanamivir molecules were varied and activity assessed against A/Sydney/5/97 and B/Harbin/7/95 viruses. Preliminary experiments showed that the greatest activity was found with linkers of 13-18 atoms with substantially lower activity for shorter linkers and evidence of reduced activity for longer linkers. For example, a dimer with a 14 carbon alkyl linker had an EC 50 of 0.14 ng/ml for A/Sydney/97 and 0.32 ng/mL for B/Harbin/95 in cytopathic effect assays.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 932, "end": 992, "text": "(Simon Tucker, Biota Holdings Limited, Melbourne, Australia)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility network (Maria Zambon)"}, {"text": "Rat lung retention studies were done by delivering 0.4 mg/kg of the study drug or zanamivir via intra-tracheal instillation.

Data was collected as part of a compassionate use program for the management of influenza outbreaks in residential long term care facilities (LTCF) for the elderly in Ontario, Canada during the 1999-2000 influenza season. Over 90% of the residents and staff of the facilities had received influenza vaccination in the fall of 1999. Oseltamivir was offered to residents of 10 facilities during 11 outbreaks of influenza, all due to A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2). In five outbreaks, transmission of influenza occurred despite amantadine prophylaxis, and oseltamivir was offered to residents for treatment and prophylaxis. In the remaining six, residents were of-fered their choice of amantadine or oseltamivir when the outbreak was recognized. Data were collected daily or every other day on the status of the outbreak. A retrospective chart review was done to identify antibiotic use, influenza complications, hospitalizations, and deaths. Patients who developed influenza while receiving amantadine prophylaxis were offered oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. Ill residents who had not taken amantadine previously, were offered either amantadine (100 mg QD\u00d7 5 days, dose adjusted for creatinine clearance) or oseltamivir as above. All patients were comparable with regard to age, severity of illness, baseline ADL capacity, and vaccination status. There were 23 patients with influenza-like illness (few patients had culture or PCR documented influenza) who received no therapy, 60 who received amantadine more than 48 h after symptom onset, 23 who received oseltamivir more than 48 h after the onset of symptoms, 50 who received oseltamivir within 48 h, and 14 who had symptom onset while receiving oseltamivir prophylaxis and who continued on oseltamivir therapy. Patients who started oseltamivir less than 48 h after the onset of symptoms or were on oseltamivir prophylaxis had significantly few complications, hospitalizations, and deaths relative to those who received no therapy, amantadine or delayed oseltamivir. Fewer antibiotics were prescribed for those residents who received early, specific influenza therapy (Table 2) . Oseltamivir was well tolerated; overall 3 of 87 residents had adverse events (one each with confusion, dizziness, and headache).

Prophylaxis was initiated following a confirmed influenza A outbreak in the LTCF. Events modeled were drug related adverse events, emergence of ILI while on prophylaxis, use of antibiotics, ILI complications, all cause mortality and resistance to amantadine. We estimated that 40% (31-64%) of LTCF to would have an influenza A outbreak and in those facilities, 17% (2-43%) of patients would develop ILI without prophylaxis. Without prophylaxis, 20% (17-48%) of patients with ILI develop a serious complication and 11% (2-22%) die. Probabilities were determined from randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Based on the available literature, in LTCFs without identified amantadine resistance, amantadine PEP reduced the risk of developing ILI by 60% and oseltamivir PEP by 63%. Costs for drugs, labs, physician visits, and acute hospital days were included based on Canadian government sources and published literature. We assumed all patients receiving amantadine had dose adjustment according to creatinine clearance at a cost of $16.52 (2002 CDN) per patient for laboratory studies, but the cost of pharmacist and nursing time for dose calculation was not included. Results showed that compared to no prophylaxis, oseltamivir saved $3357 per 100 patients and prevented 4.2 ILI cases per 100 patients. Compared to amantadine, oseltamivir saved $1348 per 100 patients and prevented 1.4 ILI cases per 100 patients. The cost of amantadine dose adjustment was a significant cost in the amantadine PEP strategy. Compared to no prophylaxis in this analysis, PEP strategies save overall health care costs despite additional drug acquisition cost. Based on these results, prophy-laxis with oseltamivir is a cost-effective influenza prevention strategy in the LTCF environment. Winther, Uni6ersity of Virginia, Charlottes6ille, VA) Influenza enters the host by depositing in the eyes or nose, typically by the hands, or by inhalation. The anatomy of the upper airway is optimized to enhance influenza virus deposition in the nasopharynx (Proetz, 1953) . After deposition, it readily infects the adenoid epithelium (Winther et al., 1990) but may also spread to the sinuses, eustachian tube, and the middle ear. Recent studies have shown that nose blowing, but not sneezing or coughing, is capable of raising intranasal pressures as high as 70 mmHg. These same studies have used iodinated contrast to demonstrate the passage of material from the nasopharynx to the sinuses with nose blowing (Gwaltney et al., 2000a) . Currently, very little information exists on involvement of sinuses during influenza infection in children. In children with common cold symptoms of less than 72 h, the majority (90%) had evidence of sinusitis by CT scan days 1-5 and 41% by days 21-28 (Schwartz et al., 2001) .

VP14637 inhibits the early fusion event, as documented by time of drug addition studies, by interacting with a conserved pneumoviral target on the fusion protein (Zhao et al., 2000) VP14637 is highly potent against RSV-A and B strains with an EC 50 of 0.0005 mM in viral CPE assays. VP14637 is specific for RSV and does not inhibit the replication of other common viral respiratory pathogens. Clinical isolates of RSV collected over the past 10 years from North America and Europe were inhibited at VP14637 concentrations of 0.0001-0.08 mM. It markedly inhibits both virus yields and RSV antigen expression in cell culture. The compound is also efficacious in vivo in the cotton rat model of RSV infection when delivered by small particle aerosol. Escape mutant analysis has identified the conserved fusion protein as the target for VP14637 inhibition. Initial clinical studies with VP14637 are progressing.
