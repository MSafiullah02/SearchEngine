            "text": "Sepsis is a common clinical syndrome arising from a dysregulated host response to systemic infection leading to life-threatening end-organ damage1. While the incidence of sepsis varies2, the substantial burden of critical illness reflects an aging and susceptible population with escalating comorbid conditions3,4. With the exception of early antibiotics and fluids5\u20137, targeted new therapies for sepsis have remained elusive8. However, through research, our understanding of sepsis has evolved from being seen solely as an exuberant host immune response9 to the intersection of pro- and anti-inflammatory, endothelial, coagulation, metabolic, endocrine, and neural pathways10,11. The foundation of such research has been the use of small animals in studies to unravel mechanisms of sepsis pathophysiology and develop novel therapeutics12,13.",

Animals should also demonstrate similar signs and symptoms of infection, such as decreased activity or oral intake, change in body temperature, and change in white blood cell count12. The model should include provision of antibiotics17,18, a standard of care treatment for patients1 that may alter host cytokine responses19 and significantly improves survival20. The species should also activate similar molecular pathways, such as cytokine release in response to circulating pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)11, and should lead to development of multiple organ dysfunction (MOD)21,22. Practically, the model must be economically reasonable, easy to support, and large enough for the collection of physiological data.",

            "text": "The earliest and most widely used animal species for sepsis studies has been rats and mice. Murines are attractive because they are inexpensive, easy to breed, versatile, and genetically modifiable8,12,13. The rat model of endotoxemic sepsis with fluid resuscitation relies on intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic the physiological responses of Gram-negative sepsis in humans. Unlike human sepsis, which is a protracted response to live pathogens, LPS induces a rapid, transient inflammatory surge that causes mainly vascular injury13. The rat cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP) technique was developed to mimic human abdominal sepsis from live polymicrobial bacteria12,23,24. Though this model has been widely considered the gold standard for rodent studies, it is limited by variability in technique (e.g. number of punctures, size of puncture)23 and pathogen (e.g. polymicrobial)24. As an alternative rat model, the monomicrobial Staphylococcus aureus impregnated clot model of peritoneal sepsis was developed to simulate post-operative abdominal wound infections25. Another model using intravenous injection of live bacteria simulates the bacteremia seen in up to 69% of human septic shock24, but does so by artificially infusing a large inoculum of bacteria into the bloodstream rather than by slow release from an established nidus of infection12.",

Many large animals also exhibit sepsis physiology that is similar to humans. For instance, pigs are prone to sepsis-induced capillary leak and development of pulmonary edema, and sheep display similar hyperdynamic responses (i.e. elevated heart rate, cardiac output, and oxygen delivery with depressed systemic vascular resistance) to endotoxin as humans23. Nevertheless, notable physiological differences still exist between these large mammals and humans: Sheep and other ruminants have significantly more pulmonary intravascular macrophages compared to primates, which alters their susceptibility to sepsis-induced pneumonia and acute lung injury26,27. Pigs demonstrate a profound rise in pulmonary vascular resistance in response to bacterial sepsis which can be fatal and experiment-limiting23. And dog models of septic shock are confounded by significant intestinal mucosal congestion and hemorrhage23.",

The baboon LD10 model (107\u2013108 CFU/kg E. coli) produced mild hypotension and non-progressive organ dysfunction with spontaneous resolution. Unlike the LD100 model where animals expired rapidly, these sub-lethal models survived long enough to demonstrate that sepsis is a multistage process driven by distinct mechanisms48. Although these experiments preceded the current standard of fluid resuscitation in early sepsis6, and ischemia-reperfusion is recognized and prevented clinically, these experiments show the natural course of under-resuscitated sepsis. The initial stage is a TNF-\u03b1- and tissue factor-dependent and PAMP-mediated intravascular innate immune activation leading to microvascular DIC and organ ischemia. The second stage is the extravascular (organ) sequelae of ischemia-reperfusion injury48, with accumulation of free radicals and further release of inflammatory mediators even after pathogen clearance56. Thus, whereas the LD100 animals expired from intravascular events (hemodynamic collapse and DIC) before reperfusion could develop, the LD50 animals expired from extravascular tissue injury48. This host-mediated, pathogen-independent injury is due to widespread complement activation48,56,57. Specifically, serum C5b9 levels were significantly elevated in LD50 non-survivors, comparable to that of LD100 animals, but not in LD50 survivors48. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of organ injury and rationale for modern clinical practice including early aggressive fluid resuscitation.",

These findings suggest that prior activation of the systemic inflammatory system leads to more severe lung injury in subsequent infections.",

Further dysregulation comes from decreased expression of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a major checkpoint of the coagulation pathway68 (Fig. 1b).

Lung histopathology within the first 24 to 48 hours after inoculation demonstrated an acute exudative process with increased alveolar-capillary permeability and intra-alveolar hemorrhage, fibrin, and edema. By day 7, a restorative phase had developed with proliferation of type 2 epithelial cells. In baboons surviving to six to 27 months, lung tissue universally showed fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and significantly increased macrophage accumulation compared to controls, suggesting the long-term sequelae of ARDS is fibrosis and chronic inflammation71. Treatment of LD50 baboons with the complement inhibitor compstatin, however, decreased expression of fibrosis mediators, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), myofibroblast accumulation, and collagen deposition72.",

Baboons were intravenously infused with B. anthracis at 105\u2013109 CFU and then treated with i.v. levofloxacin daily starting at 2 hours post-inoculation. Infected animals displayed a dose-dependent increase in severity of ALI, DIC, systemic inflammation, and capillary leak (vascular permeability and pleural effusions) that closely mirrored the human disease. At the highest doses (\u2265108 CFU), mortality was 100%86. Similar findings were seen in baboons infused with B. anthracis-derived peptidoglycan, the predominant carbohydrate of the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall, indicating this molecule is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) likely responsible for the inflammation and hypercoagulability seen with clinical anthrax infection87. Other studies using rhesus or cynomolgus macaques administered aerosolized B. anthracis spores via nose- or head-only exposure chambers88\u201390. Animals developed a moribund, disseminated anthrax infection with sepsis and respiratory failure over several days88,89. The inhalational model mimics the likely mechanism of exposure to B. anthracis (airborne dispersion) in a possible terrorist attack and is therefore invaluable to researchers developing novel anthrax therapies for such a public health emergency90,91.",

Cynomolgus macaques inoculated with nebulized B. anthracis experienced significantly improved survival after receiving the novel tetracycline class antibiotic TP-27188. Survival of inhalational anthrax in this primate species was also significantly improved by administering a post-exposure prophylaxis vaccine, AV790989. The combination of both post-exposure treatments was tested in rhesus macaques where antibiotics (ciprofloxacin x 14 days) and vaccine therapy (anthrax vaccine adsorbed, AVA) significantly improved post-exposure survival compared to antibiotics alone, likely due to delayed germination of anthrax spores occurring after completion of antibiotics leading to anthrax infection90. Additionally, a pre-exposure vaccine study in rhesus macaques using a conjugated anti-capsule vaccine showed robust immune response and improved survival of anthrax infection compared to either component alone113.",

The reality, however, is that the use of NHPs in research is still subject to limitations23. As highly intelligent animals, NHPs require much more stimulation and environmental enrichment than rodents, and must be housed in spacious containment facilities subject to rigorous monitoring regulations23. Additionally, the cost of one NHP experiment, when taking into account housing, personnel, and equipment costs is equivalent to that of hundreds of mice23. Significant resources and expertise are especially essential for NHP experiments involving intravenous infusions, phlebotomy, or vital sign measurements; these procedures generally require sedation, which when administered to septic animals can worsen cardiopulmonary instability (similar to patients). While such sepsis experiments have been reported for chimpanzees40, baboons70, and rhesus macaques114, they have required provision of ICU-level support (e.g., mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, fluids). An alternative strategy involves inserting and tethering indwelling intravascular catheters or vital sign recording devices to a harness worn by the animal19,115. Such devices can continuously administer fluids or medications, and measure telemetry, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature19,115. The implantation procedure itself is still a surgery that requires technical expertise, equipment, sedation, and a recovery period, but obviates the need for and inherent risks of sedation while the animal is septic. There can be device complications, however, such as catheter-associated infections116, which could confound sepsis experiments. Cost aside, NHPs require greater skill and expertise to handle than small mammals. They are several times stronger than humans per pound and can carry communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis and herpes B virus23.",

Furthermore, the outcomes of certain studies may be confounded when standard of care treatments are withheld, such as antibiotics or surgery8.

            "text": "Finally, there are ethical considerations that must be considered when discussing NHP sepsis research. The 2006 Weatherall Report commissioned by medical groups in the United Kingdom concluded that the use of NHPs in medical research is justified, provided that 1) there are no alternative means (e.g. lower animals or in vitro work) to answer the biological question; 2) the NHP model is representative of the human disease; 3) there are adequate regulations in place to ensure the welfare of NHPs; and 4) the work significantly advances human health117. The report further qualifies that each use of NHPs for medical research should be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis117. This ethical justification is predicated on the utilitarian principle that suffering by a small number of NHPs may be acceptable if the research leads to substantial benefits to many humans118. Applications of this principle include using NHP studies to prevent a harmful drug from going to clinical trial, or conversely, redirecting resources towards drugs that show significant benefits in NHPs119. Risks associated with this calculus can be attenuated by minimizing the number of animals used, and be ensuring adequate attention to animal welfare118. The former can be addressed by changes to experimental design, such as use of \u201crolling controls\u201d where the control group changes by one or two animals every experiment, or \u201cbefore-and-after\u201d studies where an animal serves as its own control. Strategies to address the latter including providing the animals with adequate food, water, space, enrichment, and social interactions117. The latter can also be addressed by using humane endpoints, or predetermined changes in animal physiology, rather than experimental endpoints, such as mortality. Furthermore, distinctions between different NHP species are likely relevant. For instance, the use of use great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans) in medical research was banned in the European Union in 2011 and phased out in the U.S. in 2013119. These ethical and policy issues are far from settled, and the justification for using monkeys or lesser apes (siamangs and gibbons) in medical research going forward must be continually reassessed. At the very least, the authors propose that their use should be limited to therapeutic studies (rather than mechanistic ones), which are more likely to directly impact human health.",

They have helped to deeply shape our current understanding of sepsis pathophysiology. These models have evolved from discovery of biochemical pathways to drug development. The E. coli bacteremia model has translated dozens of therapies targeting the inflammatory and coagulation pathways from rodent experiments to human clinical trials. However, despite their initial promise in preclinical NHP studies, no pharmacologic therapy has yet demonstrated benefit in humans. Their lack of success may not be due to failure of the animal model itself, but rather to the need to identify crucial targets and pathways in sepsis. Owing to their high cost and intelligence, the use of NHPs in sepsis research today is reserved exclusively for preclinical drug and therapy development, rather than for mechanistic studies in order that novel sepsis treatments can either move to clinical testing or be abandoned before the expense of a clinical trial.",
