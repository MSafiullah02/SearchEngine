IB is frequently involved in upper respiratory disease, nephritis, and enteritis. Furthermore, IB frequently results in poor fertility and low egg production in layers. Recently, it appears that IB broadly affects other tissues, for example, the proventriculus (reviewed in Cook et al, 2012, de Wit et al, 2011). Moreover, super infection and other notable bacterial co-infections can lead in an increase in the severity of IB (Bakaletz, 1995).",

            "text": "IBV is a member of a genus Gammacoronavirus. IBV genome consists of a single-stranded RNA that encodes four structural proteins: envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and spike (S) glycoprotein. The S glycoprotein of IBV, which forms large club-shaped projections, is a dimer or trimer (Cavanagh, 2007). The S protein is formed by two non-covalently bound polypeptides, S1 and S2 (Stern and Sefton, 1982). The function of the S1 protein is to attach to host cell receptor molecules. The S1 protein includes epitopes and determinants for virus neutralizing antibodies that provide protective immunity. Thus, S1 gene analysis has been widely used to differentiate IBV genotypes and serotypes (Cavanagh, 2007, Ignjatovic, Galli, 1994, Ladman et al, 2006). It is well known that two major forces drive coronavirus evolution: mutations due to the high error rates of the viral RNA polymerase, and recombination of the S1 sequences. Thereby, these generate new strains or genotypes of IBV worldwide (Jackwood et al, 2012, Yu et al, 2001).",

Most birds were village chickens exhibiting mild to moderate symptoms associated with respiratory, enteric, and kidney signs and depression with low morbidity and mortality. Of the total cases submitted, 24 samples were IBV positive. Co-infections or secondary bacterial infections were not found in any diseased birds. Virus isolation and propagation were achieved by inoculating 0.2 ml of 10% (w/v) pooled and homogenized suspected tissues into the allantoic cavity of 9- to 11-day old antibody-free embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), which came from healthy flocks screened for key poultry diseases (Guy, 2008). Forty-eight to 72 hours after inoculation, the allantoic fluid and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) were harvested. Following three to five blind passages, indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) was used to identify the causative virus. Briefly, frozen infected CAMs were acetone-fixed, following this the slides were incubated with a nucleocapsid protein-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (clone Ch/IBV 48.4; Prionics, The Netherlands), for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After washing three times with PBS, the slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako, Denmark) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C to detect antibody binding. Next, the sections were washed in a similar manner and examined using epifluorescence microscopy at 100\u2013200\u00d7 magnifications.",

The reasons for this are flock management system, mismatched vaccination, and emergence and reemergence of new variant strains. Extensive antigenic variation, caused by genetic mutation in the hypervariable region of the S1 glycoprotein, is a feature of IBV and new variants thereof (Jackwood et al., 2012). Moreover, the S1 protein is associated with virus-neutralizing epitopes, thereby inducing a strain-specific neutralizing antibody (de Wit et al, 2011, Hofstad, 1981). In Thailand, commercially available IBV vaccines are applied in intensive poultry farming. Aside from commercial poultry, a limited number of backyard chickens are vaccinated. This is, at least in part, why IBVs are still prevalent. A better understanding of the genetic diversity of the IBV S1 gene from diverse geographies is essential for effective control and prevention of IB. Selection of proper vaccines is an ultimate goal for minimizing economic loss.",
