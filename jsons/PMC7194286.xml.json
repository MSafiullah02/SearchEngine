COX\u20101 isoform is a constitutive form of the enzyme found in many tissues and regulates normal homeostasis by producing prostaglandins in the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, and by platelet aggregation and renal blood flow. The COX\u20102 isoform is also constitutively expressed in a range of tissues and organs, including ovarian and renal tissue, but it is primarily induced by damage or tissue injury as a proinflammatory inducible enzyme and is responsible for the production of inducible enzymes which are converted into various eicosanoids, other specific prostaglandin end products which are inflammation mediators and amplify nociceptive input and transmission to the spinal cord (Fu et al., 1990; Kujubu et al., 1991; Lees et al., 2004).",

Based on this, they can be divided into nonselective inhibitors (aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, ketoprofen, meclofenamate), preferential COX\u20102 inhibitors (meloxicam, carprofen, nimesulide, etodolac and celecoxib), and selective COX\u20102 inhibitors (valdecoxib, rofecoxib, lumaricoxib, etoricoxib). In dogs, carprofen can be considered as a strongly preferential COX\u20102 inhibitor or selective COX\u20102 inhibitor, on basis of in vitro ratios. Deracoxib and firocoxib are selective COX\u20102 inhibitors for veterinary use (Lees et al., 2004; McCann et al., 2004). Another drug class is called dual inhibitors of NSAIDs: liclofelone and tepoxalin inhibit both COX and 5\u2010lipooxygenase (Lees et al., 2004).",

Firocoxib plasma concentrations achieved by therapeutic regimens are able to inhibit COX\u20102 with little impact on COX\u20101 activity (McCann et al., 2004). In clinical reports, firocoxib was highly effective and acceptable for controlling pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs (Hanson et al., 2006; Pollmeier et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2006); and dogs with experimentally induced synovitis, treated with firocoxib were significantly less lame than those treated with carprofen (McCann et al., 2004). Although no serious drug\u2010related adverse effects were reported in these studies (Hanson et al., 2006; Pollmeier et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2006), there are no studies evaluating the occurrence of adverse effects under controlled laboratory conditions.",

Administration of NSAIDs is the most common predisposing factor for gastroduodenal ulceration in dogs (Stanton & Bright, 1989).

Although oral firocoxib did not cause any adverse effects in the present study, it should only be prescribed at approved labeled dosages. Corticosteroids and other NSAIDs should not be administered in close temporal association because this may be a risk factor for inducing side effects (Mathews, 1996; Boston et al., 2003; Lascelles et al., 2005b).",

The development of COX\u20102 selective NSAIDs aims to improve the overall balance between efficacy and safety (Lascelles et al., 2005a). Firocoxib was the first veterinary NSAID that is a selective COX\u20102 inhibitor (McCann et al., 2004). This study supports the evidence for the benefits of COX\u20102 selectivity in causing less GI side effects. However, even COX\u20102 selective drugs are not side\u2010effect free. In a recent report, rofecoxib, another selective COX\u20102 inhibitor was given to dogs for 56 days and caused severe gastric, duodenal, and gastroduodenal mucosal damage compared with placebo treatment (Moreau et al., 2005). Although rofecoxib is not approved and licensed for dogs, further studies evaluating the long\u2010term use of firocoxib in dogs are necessary to know if the drug could cause similar GI damage to rofecoxib.",

More than 1000 dogs with osteoarthritis were enrolled in the Previcox Experience Trial across the USA. Firocoxib was associated with a few side effects, like diarrhea and elevated blood chemistry results; sometimes these were not considered by owners or investigators to be a reason to discontinue the treatment. Vomiting was the most common finding in <2% of that study population and also in another one involving 218 dogs (Pollmeier et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2006). The absence of side effects in our study might be due to the small number of animals used. However, another study using the same number of dogs (n = 6), lesion scores, and the same veterinarian performing the gastroscopies after 90 days of treatment, the prevalence of GI lesions showed that long\u2010term use of NSAIDs (carprofen, flunixin, meloxicam, ketoprofen and etodolac) caused gastric lesions and clinical signs of GI damage (Luna et al., 2007). Our findings, even with a small number of dogs, suggest the safety of firocoxib and are in accordance with previous clinical studies where its long\u2010term use was well tolerated in dogs with osteoarthritis (Hanson et al., 2006; Pollmeier et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2006). This study cannot be extrapolated to a clinical setting in which patients typically undergo painful surgical procedures and receive NSAIDs for several weeks afterwards. In such circumstances, GI lesions may be exacerbated and result in clinical consequences.",

Gross endoscopic evaluation of gastric lesions correlates with gross lesions at necropsy and is therefore a reliable method of evaluating ulceration and gastric adverse effects (Dow et al., 1990; Boston et al., 2003). Animals may show gastric lesions in endoscopy, even if they do not present any clinical signs of side effects from the use of NSAIDs (Moreau et al., 2005; Dowers et al., 2006; Luna et al., 2007). In this study, firocoxib did not cause any abnormal signs of GI toxicity or lesions, or any laboratory abnormalities when compared with healthy dogs where lactose was administered. In another study, dogs receiving carprofen and deracoxib for only 5 days showed gastric lesions during endoscopy (Dowers et al., 2006). However, the presence of ulcers might have been due to the short evaluation periods in that study (Dowers et al., 2006). In our study, endoscopy was performed before and after 28 days treatment, enough time for the gastric adaptation phenomenon (Graham et al., 1988; Papich, 1997; Dowers et al., 2006). Evaluation of the mechanisms involved in NSAID\u2010induced GI injury was beyond the scope of this study.",

Clinicians should therefore be aware that in routine investigation using fecal occult blood tests, the gastroduodenal damage caused by NSAIDs often goes undetected, as some studies reported that fecal examinations did not detect abnormalities, even when there were erosive and ulcerative lesions (Forsyth et al., 1998; Moreau et al., 2005). This was not the case in our study, because endoscopy did not reveal GI damage.",

For a better renal function assessment, glomerular filtration rate or renal scintigraphic imaging should be used because it is a good progress marker for renal insufficiency and nephropathies, even in the early stages (Raekallio et al., 2006). Acute renal damage is more likely to result from NSAID use in animals which already have compromised renal function or are under anesthesia (Mathews et al., 1990; Ko et al., 2000).",

The reasons for increased serum ALT activity in one lactose\u2010treated dog before and at 7, 21, and 28 days are unknown. After the end of the study, this dog was submitted to abdominal ultrasound which did not reveal any abnormality. Another dog treated with firocoxib had increased serum GGT activity at 7 and 14 days but its subsequent GGT values were within reference values.

Bleeding time determination is the best in vivo test because it is inexpensive and a quick means of assessing primary hemostasis (Fresno et al., 2005). In this study, BMBT, platelet count and blood platelet aggregation values were not altered during firocoxib administration.
