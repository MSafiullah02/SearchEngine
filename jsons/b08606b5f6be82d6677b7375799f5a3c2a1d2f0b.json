            "text": "We describe a lethal respiratory outbreak among wild chimpanzees in Uganda in 2013 for which molecular and epidemiologic analyses implicate human rhinovirus C as the cause. Postmortem samples from an infant chimpanzee yielded near-complete genome sequences throughout the respiratory tract; other pathogens were absent. Epidemiologic modeling estimated the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) for the epidemic as 1.83, consistent with the common cold in humans. Genotyping of 41 chimpanzees and examination of 24 published chimpanzee genomes from subspecies across Africa showed universal homozygosity for the cadherin-related family member 3 CDHR3-Y 529 allele, which increases risk for rhinovirus C infection and asthma in human children. These results indicate that chimpanzees exhibit a species-wide genetic susceptibility to rhinovirus C and that this virus, heretofore considered a uniquely human pathogen, can cross primate species barriers and threatens wild apes. We advocate engineering interventions and prevention strategies for rhinovirus infections for both humans and wild apes.",

The elevated virulence of rhinovirus C derives from its unique reliance on the cadherinrelated family member 3 (CDHR3) receptor for host cell binding (6) . A single-nucleotide polymorphism in CDHR3 (rs6967330, C529Y) is associated with a 10-fold increase of RV-C binding and progeny yield and is a major risk factor for rhinovirus C infection and asthma (7) . The protective CDHR3-C 529 nonrisk allele has been detected exclusively in modern humans, whereas archaic Neanderthal and Denisovan humans each expressed the ancestral risk allele (8) . The origin of rhinovirus C and the spread of the protective allele among modern human populations is thought to have occurred \u22488,000 years ago (9) .",

However, because of the limitations of field-based diagnostics, direct detection of pathogens from lesions of the respiratory tract has proven difficult (12, 14) . In this study, we were able to identify rhinovirus C, a pathogen not previously known to infect species other than humans, as the causative agent of an epidemic of respiratory disease in chimpanzees by directly sampling the lesions of a dead animal and by subsequent noninvasive sampling (from feces) and epidemiological modeling.",

At the onset of the epidemic, the community consisted of 56 chimpanzees <1 week-56.9 years of age. All Kanyawara chimpanzees are individually identifiable and habituated to human observers, such that trained field assistants collected direct data on behavior and respiratory signs daily. We compiled these data into weekly measures of clinical signs (coughing or sneezing, further classified as mild or severe) and deaths. During June-August 2013, we collected fecal samples from 41 chimpanzees. Immediately after observing defecation by a chimpanzee, we placed 5 mL of the fecal sample into an equal volume of RNAlater buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), homogenized the mixture, and stored the sample at -20\u00b0C for up to 3 months, until export to the United States.",

The postmortem analysis revealed ecchymotic hemorrhages on the lung surfaces, consolidation of the parenchyma of both lungs (approximately two thirds of both lungs affected), mucoid exudate in the bronchi, hepatomegaly, and hepatic congestion. On the basis of these findings, the cause of death was concluded to be severe acute pneumonia. Deep sequencing of swab samples from this chimpanzee's oropharynx, trachea, and lung yielded 10,722,035 sequence reads, of which 8,918 had high similarity to rhinovirus C. No other pathogens were detected. Subsequent qPCR confirmed infection with RV-C, with viral loads of 7.41 \u00d7 10 6 copies/swab in the oropharynx, 1.05 \u00d7 10 7 copies/swab in the trachea, and 1.74 \u00d7 10 6 copies/swab in the lung; these values are comparable to the average viral load (7.76 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL) found in rhinovirus C-infected children with acute wheezing illness treated in an emergency department (27) . Further sequencing yielded a near-complete rhinovirus C genome consisting of a complete polyprotein gene of 6,450 bases, a complete 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of 35 bases excluding the poly(A) tail, and a partial 5\u2032-UTR of 480 bases. The viral polyprotein sequence was 94.59% at the nucleic acid level and 99.99% similar at the amino acid level to its closest known relative, a rhinovirus C45 sequence (GenBank accession no. JN837686) from a 2-month-old male patient who had a history of mild nasal congestion and discharge in the United States in 2000. RDP4 analyses showed the chimpanzee-derived sequence to be a rhinovirus C45-C11 recombinant, with a breakpoint in the 5\u2032-UTR (Figure 2 ). In phylogenetic analyses, the virus clustered within known rhinovirus C genotypes, appearing as a sister taxon to the reference rhinovirus C45 isolate (Figure 3) . The chimpanzee-derived strain was designated RV-C45-cpz1-2013 to indicate its presumptive serotype and discovery in a chimpanzee in 2013 (GenBank accession no. KY624849).",

The analyses we present show that rhinovirus C is also distinguished by its ability to cross primate species barriers and cause severe disease. Although experiments conducted in the 1960s showed rhinoviruses A and B to be capable of infecting chimpanzees in captivity, infections were mild and self-limiting (36, 37) . Among other enteroviruses, only poliovirus has been implicated as a cause of death in wild chimpanzees (38) . By showing that rhinovirus C is highly pathogenic in wild chimpanzees, our findings expand the known host range and clinical consequences of one of the most common causes of human respiratory disease. Variant RV-C45-cpz1-2013 occupies an unremarkable phylogenetic position among rhinovirus C genomic variants from humans around the world (Figure 3 ). Although this virus is a recombinant between 2 genotypes, C11 and C45, it is unlikely that this property is related to its origin in a chimpanzee host. Indeed, rhinoviruses often recombine; the parent strains of RV-C45-cpz1-2013 and the genomic location of the recombination event are similar to those described previously (3) . RV-C45-cpz1-2013 also shares with other rhinovirus C variants the capacity to infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe disease. Viral load values from this animal's oropharynx (7.41 \u00d7 10 6 copies/ swab), trachea (1.05 \u00d7 10 7 copies/swab), and lung (1.74 \u00d7 10 6 copies/swab) are comparable to the average viral load (7.76 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL) found in rhinovirus C-infected children with acute wheezing illness treated in an emergency department (27) . Although published estimates of rhinovirus epidemiologic transmission parameters are sparse, the values estimated for the 2013 chimpanzee outbreak (transmission rate 0.68/d; duration of infection 3.2 days) are close to those of common cold viruses in humans (transmission rate 0.74/d; duration of infection 3.0 days) (39) . Despite this similarity, these values are likely similar for many acute respiratory viruses.",

For example, during 47 years of wild chimpanzee observation in Gombe, Tanzania, respiratory disease accounted for 48% of illness-related deaths and was the predominant cause of lethal illness in this population (40) . When noninvasive diagnoses were attempted in other populations, human paramyxoviruses were sometimes implicated (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, rhinovirus C could have been missed in outbreaks for which the cause was never identified. Standard molecular diagnostics for rhinoviruses might have failed to detect rhinovirus C, which is genetically divergent from rhinoviruses A and B (28) . Furthermore, rhinoviruses are adapted to the respiratory tract and are acid sensitive, such that virions dissociate below pH 6.0 (41) . Because of this property, rhinoviruses are unlikely to survive gastrointestinal transit, and their nucleic acids are unlikely to be found in feces, except during acute and fulminant infections (42) . Noninvasive diagnostics of ape respiratory disease outbreaks might, therefore, be inherently limited in detecting rhinoviruses, which is unfortunate given that the remote locations in which these endangered apes live often preclude invasive diagnostics (12) .",

GenBank searches of all published nonhuman primate genome sequences suggest that modern humans are the only primate species in which the CDHR3-C 529 nonrisk allele occurs (A.C. Palmenberg, unpub. data). In agreement with this finding, all chimpanzees genotyped from the Kanyawara community and across Africa were homozygous for the CDHR3-Y 529 risk allele. The fact that only modern humans (and not Neanderthals or Denisovans) possess the nonrisk allele implies that resistance to rhinovirus C infection was selected for only in modern humans (9) .

We created alignments using the MAFFT algorithm (18) implemented in the computer program Translator X (19) , with the Gblocks algorithm (20) applied to remove poorly aligned regions. We constructed trees using the maximum-likelihood method implemented in PhyML (22) , with best-fit models of molecular evolution estimated from the data by using jModelTest (21) . Circles on nodes indicate statistical confidence on the basis of 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the data (closed circles 100%; open circles >75%). Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. GenBank accession numbers and other details of the RV-C sequences included in the analysis are in online Technical Appendix Table ( samples or in fecal samples from the 41 other animals. All adenoviruses sequenced from fecal samples were similar or identical to adenoviruses that have been documented in apparently healthy wild chimpanzees and other primates (32, 34, 35, 43) . Finally, clinical signs during the chimpanzee outbreak bore a striking resemblance to those caused by rhinovirus C in susceptible humans, and epidemiologic transmission parameter estimates were consistent with the common cold in human populations (39) . Nevertheless, we cannot rule out adenoviruses or other undetected co-infecting agents as contributing factors because such infections can enhance the clinical severity of rhinovirus C (1). In this regard, we note that simian immunodeficiency virus, which can cause immunodeficiency in wild chimpanzees (44) , was not detected and is thought to be absent from this chimpanzee population (45) .",

Accordingly, myriad pathways exist by which the Kanyawara chimpanzees could have been exposed to rhinovirus C from humans. Current guidelines for visiting wild apes in Uganda and other countries are based in part on generalized risks for respiratory disease transmission from humans (e.g., quarantine periods for arriving travelers are mandated at Kanyawara) (46) .

            "text": "Although the mandate that researchers and tourists visiting wild apes wear facemasks is controversial, this practice has successfully reduced the transmission of rhinoviruses and other co-infecting agents that exacerbate rhinovirus clinical severity in hospital settings (48) . Similarly, proper hygiene and the use of hand sanitizer effectively reduce the amounts of rhinovirus on human fingers (49) . Decades ago, captive chimpanzees were used as study subjects in biomedical research intended to evaluate putative rhinovirus prevention and treatment options (36, 37, 50) . Our results suggest that these investigations could ultimately benefit the wild relatives of the chimpanzees that were the original subjects of these laboratory experimentations. We advocate building upon existing data to engineer novel interventions and prevention strategies for rhinovirus infections in both humans and wild apes. ",
