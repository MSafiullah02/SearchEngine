The chapter overall focuses on exemplary biochemical sample solutions and the respective applications, even though all principles are well applicable to other fields of natural sciences targeting nano particles.

            "text": "In general, all kinds of particles scatter electromagnetic waves in all directions, depending on their size isotropically or anisotropically. The laser light that is scattered by the particles inside a small focal volume of a DLS sample is continuously recorded and quantified by a photon-counting detector positioned at a specific angle; if not hindered by other geometrical restraints, an angle of 90\u00b0might be suitable for the experimental setup. The number of photons hitting the detector, which can be a photomultiplier tube, is fluctuating over time. This is explained by Brownian motion of particles in and around the sample volume that is in focus of the laser (Fig. 6. 2), which results in characteristic size-dependent fluctuation intervals of the electric field component of the scattered light. Scattering intensity pattern are correlated with themselves (auto-correlation) after short delay intervals of time (\u03c4) to monitor the continuous decay of correlation. Depending on how fast particles are diffusing, the correlation decay time constants, which are derived from the exponential autocorrelation function (ACF) are individually different. Decay time constants of small particles are shorter in agreement with the dependency of diffusion speed on particle mass ( Fig. 6 .2). The ACF can be evaluated by the CONTIN algorithm according to Provencher (1982) , which allows to fit even a complex decay of correlation in polydisperse solutions to calculate the respective diffusion constants (D) and process the data. As for most measurements the temperature T is kept constant and the viscosity \u03b7 of the sample solution is known, or can be determined rather easily, this translational diffusion constant D can be used to determine the hydrodynamic radius r h of a corresponding spherical particle, according to the Stokes-Einstein equation (Eq. 6.1). This relationship between diffusion and size was established in 1906 and is also useful for complementary methods like Taylor-Dispersion analysis or nano particle tracking analysis (k B is the Boltzmann constant 1.380648 \u00d7 10 \u221223 J K \u22121 ):",

Further, all changes of D over time for given particles, typically due to particle size changes, can also be followed in real time. DLS is very often used in preparation and systematic optimization of sample solutions (pH-value, ionic strength, solvent etc.) to meet strict requirements of particle homogeneity and long-term stability in further structural investigation of macromolecules, see e.g. Borgstahl (2006) in terms of X-ray crystallography or exemplified for RNA-protein complexes (Stetefeld et al. 2016) . In this context DLS is frequently used in combination with other scattering techniques or mass spectrometry. For example small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), NMR spectroscopy and crystallization experiments usually require a high degree of particle size homogeneity, i.e. a monodisperse solution (Jeffries et al. 2016) . Today, individual light scattering techniques and setups allow to manipulate the solution composition during the experiment , investigate sample solutions in flow, to investigate a sample suspension at different neighboring positions in parallel (Falke et al. 2018) , determine the net surface charge of molecules (Ware 1974) or even allow to obtain limited shape and structure information in situ (Cantor and Schimmel 1980; Minton 2007; Haghighi et al. 2013; Schubert et al. 2015) as outlined in following sections of this chapter. Especially for in situ DLS instruments with freely adjustable laser probe the alignment of the optics, i.e. the superposition of the focal points of the laser and the focal point of the lens that focusses the scattered light on a receiver fiber should be verified via a set of screws with \u03bcm precision to obtain optimal performance.",

Light is scattered spherically in all directions, while maintaining nearly constant energy of the photons. Most samples of interest for a biochemist, like proteins in solution, are much smaller than the wavelength of the applied DLS laser (<0.1\u03bb) allowing light penetration and isotropic scattering according to the laws of Rayleigh scattering (Barnett 1942) named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. The scattered light is typically not coherent and the spherical waves interfere with each other.

            "text": "The average value of I over all scattering angles is commonly called scattering cross section. The scattering intensity is notably inverse proportional to the forth power of the laser wavelength, which makes a shorter wavelength very attractive for the detection of otherwise weakly scattering molecules. However, an increased intensity of \"background\" reflections of laser light can obviously reduce the sensitivity of the instrument again. Further, the focal lengths of lenses should be shortened as possible, according to I~s \u22122 . Also probe position and fiber cables should be optimized accordingly. For additional optimization, glass surfaces may be coated with a thin layer of MgF 2 or a similar solid material with low refractive index, to minimize reflection of laser light. Further, the light scattering intensity depends on the sixth power of the particle diameter. Consequently, larger particles contribute to the total scattering intensity exponentially more with increasing size, making DLS particularly sensitive for clustering (very large oligomers or unspecific large aggregates) compared to smaller molecules. When the diameter of the particles increases to the size regime of the laser wavelength, the particles create shape dependent anisotropic Mie scattering (referring to the German physicist Gustav Adolf Mie) distorted in forward direction (Mie 1908) . One example is sun light scattered by spherical lipid droplets in diluted milk. For particles significantly larger than the wavelength, surface reflection becomes predominant and the scattering cross section, which determines how much light is scattered by the particle, only weakly depends on the light frequency.",

To also ensure that r h is not concentration dependent, typically in an artificial manner, the diffusion constant D can be determined at different concentrations. Those diffusion constants should be evaluated by a Debye plot. A linear dependency of D on the concentration allows to extrapolate D to a value at infinite dilution (unbiased by attractive or repulsive interactions), similar to the extrapolation of size parameters in X-ray scattering data processing. A high correlation value of the ACF at correlation time values of nearly zero (y-axis intercept), which is considered as an essential \"signal-to-noise ratio\" parameter, will obviously improve the accuracy of the ACF evaluation. However, if the sample concentration is too high or the solution becomes nearly non-transparent, the ACF and the applicability of DLS will suffer from multiple photon scattering. The calculation of an ACF can generally be completed in around 2 s. Nonetheless, static DLS experiments are typically running for 10-30 s and are repeated several times for averaging and verification. Scattering intensity data of weakly scattering molecules can to some extend be statistically improved by prolonging the measurement time. Required minimum concentrations heavily depend on several parameters of the instrumentation, most obviously laser intensity and detector sensitivity. Commonly, a monomeric protein of 30-40 kDa has a sufficient scattering intensity at concentrations of around 1-2 g l \u22121 (or around 50 \u03bcM) in a typical cuvette DLS instrument.

The application of DLS under shear flow conditions and in a microfluidic channel, both mathematically and via an initial experimental approach with regard to flow channel dimensions, shear rate, velocity profile of the Poiseuille flow and Doppler shift interferences has been verified (Destremaut et al. 2009 ). The obtained theoretical approximation of an ACF with some geometrical restrains underlined the applicability of DLS in flow mode. The DLS experiments in this study were performed in a widened channel segment of a microfluidic PDMS chip with dimensions of 500 by 700 \u03bcm. Further stopped-flow DLS experiments have already been performed to study stages of protein folding (Gast et al. 1997 ) and characterize spherical latex particles in flow utilizing a specific fiber optic laser probe (Leung et al. 2006) . This experimental setup is potentially indicating a huge variety of further applications to count and determine the size of macromolecules in place and in flow.",

It contains a split laser beam, which essentially hits the sample particles typically at two different angles with the same scattering vector. A potential contribution of multiple scattering is expected to vary for the two scattering pattern recorded in parallel, whereas the contribution of single scattering remains constant.

Moreover, the applicability of DLS and scattering intensity measurements to hydrogel environments was evaluated (Rochas and Geissler 2014) . Dynamic light scattering can also be applied to verify oligomerization and crystallization of Macromolecules in preparation for experiments under microgravity conditions. Studying macromolecular interactions and symmetry under microgravity conditions has always been attractive, e.g. to obtain crystals of superior size, lattice homogeneity and maximized diffraction capability (Drebes et al. 2016) . Gels or microfluidic chips, which are \"down to earth\" tools to partially mimic microgravity conditions, can be combined with in situ DLS as mentioned before to follow the crystal growth. Further, timeresolved experiments in outer space like at the International Space Station could be monitored by DLS in this context. A National Aeronautics and Space Administration research institute applied a DLS technique to detect clinical eye cataract in an early stage (Ansari et al. 2000) .",

The displayed ferritin crystals (bottom right), which are >100 \u03bcm in all dimensions in size, are exposed to UV-light as well to confirm the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein.
