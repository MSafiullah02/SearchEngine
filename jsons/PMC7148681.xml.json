Although we may not have created the actual pathogens, we have either unwittingly or deliberately permitted the environment that has both brought forth the pathogen and in some situations improved the environment to enable them to flourish (Kiple, 1999). Unwittingly, through our development and the establishment of trade routes, and especially now with rapid travel so readily available to large numbers of people, we have enabled pathogens to spread around the world as the recent Ebola outbreak has shown. But we have also deliberately spread communicable diseases and the history of this goes back hundreds of years. Although biological warfare may not be entirely ethical, it is a reality that has a long history. Infected cadavers and animal carcasses were an early means of biological warfare. The siege of Kaffa in 1345\u20131346 was an excellent although more recent example of this (Murray, 2004). Kaffa (now known as Feodosiya) was then a bustling sea port on the Crimean Peninsula. The Mongols, whose attacking troops, became infected with the plague (Yersinia pestis), threw the infected cadavers over the city wall resulting in an epidemic in the city, presumably aided and abetted by the rats and their fleas, and the eventual surrender of the besieged city. It is thought that some of those who escaped Kaffa by sea were responsible for the Black Death that spread to Constantinople (Istanbul) and then through Europe.",

The role of these guardians was to detect and exclude ships carrying infected people on board from entering the port (Declich and Carter, 1994, Evans and Kaslow, 1999). Health surveillance, similar to current concepts, consisting of the general principles of data collection, analysis, and dissemination for action did not come into existence until later in the development of civilization. During the seventeenth century, the parish clerks in London made regular reports of deaths from the plague to the Parish Clerks\u2019 Company who compiled and analyzed the data for weekly dissemination and action (Declich and Carter, 1994). It was not, however, until the early nineteenth century that the more modern principles of health surveillance were created. The father of this was William Farr, Superintendent of the Statistical Department of the General Registry of London, who wrote a series of letters on the causes of death in England. Although this brief description may suggest it, not all surveillance achievements occurred in England. Many occurred at various times over the past centuries in Europe (both east and west) and later in the United States.",

In 1949, the concept of surveillance as the monitoring of disease occurrence in populations as expounded by Langmuir (1963) was implemented by the newly created Communicable Diseases Center (now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) to monitor malaria and later residual smallpox cases in the United States. This new concept of surveillance, when applied to a disease meant the continued watchfulness over the distribution and trends of incidence through the systematic collection, consolidation and evaluation of morbidity and mortality reports and other relevant data. Intrinsic in the concept is the regular dissemination of the basic data and interpretations to all who have contributed and to all others who need to know. (Langmuir, 1963)In 1963, Karel Ra\u0161ka, an eminent Czechoslovakian physician and epidemiologist, became Director of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Division of Communicable Disease. His definition of disease surveillance is \u201cthe epidemiological study of a disease as a dynamic process involving the ecology of the infectious agent, the host, the reservoirs, and the vectors, as well as the complex mechanisms concerned in the spread of infection and the extent to which this spread occurs,\u201d was accepted by WHO in 1968 (Ra\u0161ka, 1966).",

In 1951, under Article 21 of the WHO Constitution, member states of the WHA agreed to the consolidation of the various conventions and regulations in force at the time into a single standard for notification of and responses to potentially infectious travelers or goods (Declich and Carter, 1994). This was called the International Sanitary Regulations and these related principally to preventing the spread of smallpox, relapsing fever, typhus, cholera, plague, and yellow fever whilst protecting trade and travel. The Regulations were updated in 1969 and renamed the International Health Regulations (IHR 1969). With the successful eradication of smallpox, the Regulations were revised in 1981 to remove smallpox. By this time, the only priority diseases remaining of the original six were cholera, plague, and yellow fever, diseases that were no longer a serious threat to developed countries. Although the Regulations remained, the political will to implement them dissipated in the developed countries encouraging indifference from the developing countries (Fischer et al., 2011).",

The outbreak of HIV was initially identified and reported by the CDC in 1981 in a cluster of gay males in Los Angeles who developed the opportunistic Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and died (CDC, 2001). The report prompted additional reports from other American cities. Similar patterns of opportunistic diseases and unusual tumors were found in African heterosexuals of both sexes. The conditions were enteropathic illnesses (\u2018slim disease\u2019; esophageal candidiasis; cryptococcal meningitis) and an unusual tumor (Karposi\u2019s sarcoma) (Quinn, 2001). Evidence now shows that HIV was an escalating epidemic in central Africa and that the development of this epidemic had gone unnoticed officially until the infection spread internationally (Fischer et al., 2011). In 1983, WHO held its first meeting regarding the infection and initiated global surveillance. With the emergence of new and the reemerging of past infectious diseases, the WHA adopted two resolutions requiring the revision of the IHR to achieve \u201cmaximum protection against the international spread of disease with minimal interference with traffic and trade\u201d (WHA Resolution 48.7) and to develop strategies for the containment of these infections as well for their detection (WHA Resolution 48.13) (Fidler, 2003). The WHO Division of Emerging and Other Communicable Diseases was established to coordinate these programs (Fischer et al., 2011).",

A review of IHR was commenced and the outcome assisted by the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS \u2013 avian influenza virus, H5N1) epidemic in China in 2002. This epidemic of atypical pneumonia began in Guangdong Province but the Chinese did not disclose the infection to the international community until after a physician, who had been treating infected patients in Guangdong Province, developed symptoms himself and spread the infection to others whilst in Hong Kong. The infection spread to many countries causing approximately 8000 cases, 800 deaths, and significant financial costs (Fischer et al., 2011).",

They aim to \u201cprevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade\u201d (WHO, 2005). IHR 2005 is significantly different to IHR 1969. It expands the scope of the Regulations' application, places new requirements on member countries to prepare for health crises, adds new responsibilities and authority on WHO to coordinate international public health responses, mandates more demanding surveillance and response obligations, and applies human rights principles to public health interventions. From the perspective of this chapter, and perhaps one of the most important changes in the new Regulations, is the implementation of a surveillance system that far surpasses that required under IHR 1969 (for reviews and further information see Fidler, 2005, Baker and Fidler, 2006, Fischer et al., 2011; WHO web site http://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/).",

It particularly concerns, but is not limited to, infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C\u201d (GMC, 1997). The document containing this definition has been withdrawn but the term is probably in keeping with the more commonly used terms of \u2018notifiable\u2019 or \u2018reportable\u2019 disease where there is a requirement under law to report a particular disease to government authorities. There are many definitions of \u2018notifiable\u2019 or \u2018reportable\u2019 diseases but the definition used by the CDC (CDC, 2014) appears most satisfactory: \u201ca notifiable disease is one for which regular, frequent, and timely information regarding individual cases is considered necessary for the prevention and control of the disease.\u201d The surveillance and reporting of these diseases is in keeping with the requirements of IHR 2005 that most countries/states are signatories to and were obligated to implement by 2012. For many countries, surveillance and reporting (but not necessarily to WHO) was already in place and operative nationally or locally before IHR 2005 was adopted. The United Kingdom, for instance, implemented notification of infectious diseases toward the end of the nineteenth century. Australia, on the other hand, only implemented a national reporting system in 1917. With the implementation of IHR 2005, all \u2018party states\u2019 will have some form of legislation in place that enables them to fully comply with the International Regulations. Examples include the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 in Victoria, Australia, and the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 and the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 in the United Kingdom. They will also have a list of reportable diseases and on most lists the majority, if not all, diseases are infectious diseases and would be classified as potentially serious infections. These lists are usually available on the Internet and web sites for some countries are given in Table 1\n. Depending upon the constitution and make up of countries, there may be a national regulatory body with state or local government agencies reporting to it. Australia, a federation of sovereign states, is one such example. Each sovereign state maintains its own health department but reports to a national body (Table 1).",

The answer is obviously \u2018yes.\u2019 Forensic practitioners may be in a position where they will diagnose someone with a reportable disease and they are required under their local legislation to report the case to the designated authorities within a certain time period. There may be additional obligations on the clinical forensic practitioner to also either trace or assist in the tracing of contacts of the diagnosed case and to treat both the case and that person\u2019s contacts.

Although the Commonwealth of Australia legislates for some aspects of national government, each state and territory has separate health and health-related departments and associated legislation pertaining to health. Australia implemented reporting of certain diseases in 1917. The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) was established in 1989 to provide \u201cnational public health co-ordination on communicable disease surveillance, prevention and control, and offers strategic advice to governments and other key bodies on public health actions to minimise the impact of communicable diseases in Australia and the region.\u201d (Department Health, Australia, 2014a) In order to do this, CDNA established the current National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) (Department Health, Australia, 2014b) in 1990 which coordinates the national surveillance of certain communicable diseases. Notifications are made to the respective States or Territory health authority by medical practitioners under the provisions of the State or Territory public health legislation and the information is then collated and analyzed by the NNDSS. With the adoption of IHR 2005, the Commonwealth entered into an agreement (National Health Security Agreement) with the States and Territories in conjunction with the National Health Security Act 2007 to implement the requirements of IHR 2005.",

To preclude the identification of the patient, only the first two letters of the given and family name of the patient are required.\u2022Group D \u2013 Conditions include HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and written notification to the department is required within 5 days of confirmation of diagnosis.
