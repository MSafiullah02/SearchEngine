The statistical methods used to test vaccine safety hypotheses are described and the merits of different study designs evaluated; these include the cohort, case-control, case-coverage and the self-controlled case-series methods. For multiple sclerosis, the evidence does not support the hypothesized relationship with hepatitis B vaccine. For Guillain\u2212Barr\u00e9 syndrome, the evidence suggests a small elevated risk after influenza vaccines, though considerably lower than after natural influenza infection, with no elevated risk after human papilloma virus vaccine. For narcolepsy, there is strong evidence of a causal association with one adjuvanted vaccine used in the 2009/10 influenza pandemic. Rapid investigation of vaccine safety concerns, however biologically implausible, is essential to maintain public and professional confidence in vaccination programmes.",

However, as with any medical treatment or drug, vaccination can never be entirely risk free in terms of unwanted side effects. An important feature of vaccination is that unlike most therapeutic drugs, vaccines are given prophylactically to healthy individuals, often young children. When an event occurs shortly after vaccination in an otherwise healthy individual without an obvious cause, it is tempting to attribute its occurrence to the preceding vaccination. The assumption of a causal association with a vaccine from purely a temporal association is often incorrect as unrelated events will occur by chance irrespective of vaccination. It can be hard to disentangle these temporal associations when there is a strong perception that a temporal association is necessarily evidence of a causal association and the onset of the condition is insidious and its timing relies on patient or parental recall [2] . Even if only based on a temporal sequence of events, it is important that such safety concerns are rapidly investigated with robust epidemiological studies to allow mitigation procedures to be put in place if an association is confirmed or, if unfounded, to have the necessary evidence to sustain public confidence in the vaccination programme without which coverage drops and disease control is lost.",

This requires a pre-specified protocol detailing the population under study, the period after vaccination for which an elevated risk is suspected, and the methods for case identification and statistical analysis. Most importantly, the ascertainment of the condition of interest must be unbiased with respect to vaccination history [3] . The following statistical methods have been used most commonly to address vaccine safety questions and to control for the inherent biases in the population and data under study. Although these methods aim to address confounding, it can be difficult to fully control for this in an observational study. An assessment of the likelihood of residual confounding/ bias and its potential extent is an important consideration when weighing up the strength of a study and drawing a conclusion with regard to causality.",

The cases act as their own controls as the incidence of the event in pre-defined risk periods following vaccination is compared to the incidence outside the risk period generating a relative incidence (RI) measure ( Fig. 1) . A significant advantage of the method is that confounding factors that do not vary over the observation period, such as co-morbidities or sociodemographic status, are automatically controlled for. Adjustment for timevarying confounders such as age is also possible by dividing up the observation period further into age categories. It has been demonstrated that the power of the SCCS method is nearly as good as a cohort study when uptake is high and risk intervals are short, and it is superior to that of a casecontrol study [6] .",

For vaccinations given in the short age range in the first and second year of life or during a short calendar period to target ages, close matching of the controls on date of birth is required. Prior vaccination status is then compared between cases and controls using the date of onset in cases as a reference date. To obtain enough power to assess the required risk, multiple controls per case are often needed and defining appropriate criteria for the selection of controls can be problematic. While it is important to ensure that controls are similar to cases on characteristics such as age and geographical location that can independently affect vaccination status, over matching is a risk if too many extraneous variables are included in the matching, resulting in loss of efficiency and potentially introducing bias. A case-control study does not provide absolute risk estimates, rather it measures the odds of vaccination in cases compared to controls.

This was available from a representative subset of general practices in England, which also provided information on co-morbidities, the only other variable considered as a potential confounder [14] . In the first study assessing the risk of narcolepsy in children [14] , both the SCCS method and the case-coverage design was used.

An example is the damage that was made to the UK whole-cell pertussis vaccination programme in the late 1970s when neurological damage was wrongly attributed to the vaccine based on case reports of infants with onset of encephalopathy shortly after vaccination. These reports of permanent brain damage following vaccination attracted intense and sustained professional and media interest causing vaccination rates to fall from 79% in 1973 to 31% in 1978. Following this, three national epidemics of pertussis occurred with an estimated 5000 hospital admissions, 200 cases of pneumonia, 83 cases of convulsions and 38 deaths [18, 19] . Neurological vaccine safety concerns can be broadly assigned to either being biologically plausible or unsubstantiated and unexpected. The biologically plausible group are often a direct effect from a component of the vaccine. For example, in the case of a live attenuated vaccine, the adverse reaction could mimic, at a lower frequency, what the non-attenuated wild virus would do. This is demonstrated in the rare risk of acute flaccid paralysis following the oral polio vaccine after a reversion to virulence or with the risk of aseptic meningitis after the attenuated Urabe mumps strain in the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine due to retention of some neurovirulent characteristics [20, 21] . The unsubstantiated and unexpected group occurs usually because of the timing of the vaccine, which coincides with the diagnosis of the condition and has no immediate biologically plausible explanation. Examples of this are measles-mumps-rubella and autism [22] , gait disturbance and measles-mumps-rubella [23] , and thiomersal and developmental delay [24] . Although a signal may not have a clear biological basis for its causation, it still needs to be fully investigated using robust epidemiological methods.",

Not only can the diagnosis be lengthy and complex, but admitted patient care databases, which are widely used for a non-biased ascertainment of cases in vaccine safety studies, are incomplete as patients experiencing narcolepsy may not be admitted and if they are admitted, the admission date is not an accurate reflection of the onset of the narcolepsy symptoms leading to misclassification bias. An important consideration when selecting cases is the awareness of the hypothesised association. This awareness may lead to an increased reporting of cases known to be vaccinated and has two aspects; public awareness and professional awareness. First, this heightened awareness may lead to vaccinated individuals presenting to healthcare institutions and being diagnosed earlier than unvaccinated cases leading to ascertainment bias. If a condition has an insidious onset making the recall of the first symptom difficult to determine, media attention may lead to a differential recall of the symptom-onset date in the vaccinated cases. Using source documents, which were created prior to any media attention in the country of study, can address this potential recall bias. Professional awareness is likely to occur even if media attention is low, as health professionals in the specialty will be aware of current topics of interest through professional bodies and literature. Differential misclassification bias will occur if cases known to have been vaccinated are more likely to be assigned a diagnosis of narcolepsy than unvaccinated cases. In the study from England, public awareness of the association was assessed by analysing Google searches for \"narcolepsy\" in the period of interest and found there was little activity in the UK compared to Sweden (Fig. 2) [14] .",

The evidence does not support an association between MS and the hepatitis vaccine, while for GBS and influenza vaccines the evidence suggests a small increased risk though it is much smaller than the risk from a natural influenza virus infection. The now established association between narcolepsy and Pan-demrix\u2122 should act as a lesson for the vaccine safety community that sometimes unexpected but serious conditions can arise and need to be investigated rapidly however biologically implausible. The neurological vaccine safety issues outlined here demonstrate that rapid assessments of safety signals are needed to ensure that public confidence is maintained in national immunisation programmes. The confirmation of a signal and estimation of the magnitude of vaccine-attributable risk will require consistent results from a number of well-designed epidemiological studies, preferably conducted in different settings. As the experience with narcolepsy has shown, not all vaccine safety concerns can be anticipated on the basis of biologically plausible and thus predictable effects. As new vaccines are introduced, the basis of discussions on vaccine safety should be the acceptance that vaccination can carry a small risk but that this risk needs to be balanced against the enormous individual and public health benefits.",
