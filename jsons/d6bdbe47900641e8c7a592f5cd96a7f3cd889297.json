Two-thirds were boys and 58 had parents or siblings with allergic symptoms. During winter-spring, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus was verified in 50% of children. Other viral agents were adenovirus, parainfluenza 3, coxsackie B 2, ECHO 6 and rotavirus. At the acute stage, 54% of the children displayed changes on pulmonary Xray. The total IgE value was 2 + 2 S D score units in 14 children. At reinvestigation after 3-4.5 years, when the children were aged 3.3-6.3 years, 53% were free from asthmatic symptoms; the median age for the last episode was 2 years. A total of 33% had mild asthma, 8% moderate and 6% severe asthma. The factors which correlated significantly with persistent asthma were: (1) The need for daily medication for at least 6 months. (2) A young age in conjunction with the first wheezing episode and on the first admission to a paediatric ward because of asthmatic symptoms. (3) Other past or present atopic symptoms. Heredity, tobacco smoking at home, having a furry pet, RS virus infection, or high total IgE at the time of the first admission did not correlate significantly with the persistence of asthma 3-4.5 years later. The results emphasize the good overall prognosis of wheezing in early childhood, even when the wheezing is severe enough to lead to inpatient treatment. 0 AIfergy, bronchial asthma, infant, obstructive bronchitis, prognosis, respiratory syncytial virus",

The trigger factor is often a viral infection (I), producing mucosal oedema and varying degrees of bronchial smooth muscle contraction and mucus secretion, thereby narrowing the small-dimensioned bronchial lumen. This group of infants with clinically similar symptoms include children with wheezing of different etiology and prognosis, some of whom have infantile asthma which will continue throughout childhood and others who only have occasional and transient obstructive symptoms (2, 3) . When the obstructive airway symptoms with dyspnoea occur repeatedly, the child often has hyperreactive airways and a diagnosis of bronchial asthma is therefore used (2) . The aim of the present study was to analyse the prognostic value of different characteristics of obstructive bronchitis in the very young child with symptoms severe enough to warrant inpatient hospital treatment, and to identify current infectious agents and their possible impact on the long-time course.",

In our study, signs of an ongoing RS virus infection were demonstrated in as many as 50% of the children during the winter-spring period, a season in which RS virus infections are to be expected (10) . Viral infections are usually demonstrated in 40-50% of wheezing episodes in infected children ( I 1, 12) but are also suspected of being involved in the majority of the remaining cases (2, 3). Rhino-and coronavirus infections are also known to be able to trigger wheezing in children (1 3), but techniques for diagnosing rhinovirus infection were, unfortunately, not available in the present study. It is interesting to note that rotavirus was detected in five children. However, the pathogenetic importance of these findings vis-a-vis airway obstruction is uncertain.",

This demonstrates that an infiltrate on the chest film is not synonymous with a bacterial infection and suggests that chest X-ray alone is not sufficient to determine whether antibacterial treatment is indicated or not. An increase in CRP is not, however, exclusive to bacterial infection. A moderate CRP increase accompanying adenovirus and RS virus infections was not uncommon. In the group with no increase in CRP, chest film infiltrates, peripheral as well as perihilar, were just as common in the children in whom the RS virus was not found as it was in those with the RS virus. This lends support to the view that no pattern of radiographic change is specific to RS virus infection (1 5).",

The high proportion of children with an elevated total IgE, other atopic symptoms, as well as atopic heredity (Table 1) clearly demonstrated that children with an atopic disposition are overrepresented in obstructive bronchitis in early childhood compared with a normal population (1 7).",

This tendency was seen also in the first investigation (+0.4 SD score units). The proportion of children with elevated levels was the same as that in a previous study by Foucard & Sjoberg (19) . However, as in our study, the level of total IgE was a poor predictor of asthma at Only four factors correlated significantly with persistent asthma at follow-up. The need for continuous antiasthmatic medication for at least 6 months reflects a disease of greater intensity and duration. The predictive value of other atopic symptoms in the child has also been pointed out by other authors (19, 22) . A knowledge of all these factors is, however, often lacking the first time the child is admitted to hospital. In our study, the atopic symptoms already present at that time, did not significantly predict asthma at follow-up, presumably because other atopic symptoms had not appeared to a sufficiently large degree at such a young age. It was only follow-up. when the atopic symptoms which appeared subsequently were included that the correlation became statistically significant. The factors of young age in conjunction with the first symptoms and the first admission to a paediatric ward are naturally strongly correlated. At first sight, the finding of a correlation between young age in conjunction with the first episode and persistent asthma at follow-up contrasts with what has earlier been claimed (19) . However, entry to our study was restricted to children below the age of 2 years with obstructive symptoms severe enough to lead to inpatient hospital treatment. By using these inclusion criteria, we have probably defined a risk group with hyperreactive airways resulting in pronounced wheezing already at an early stage. It has been found previously that young age at first symptoms predisposes to severe asthma later on (23). This does not contradict the finding that wheezing which begins after the age of 2 years is often a sign of asthma that will persist for several years (1 9).",

On the one hand it could be hypothesized that the RS virus is associated with a high risk of future asthma through the induction of IgE production and atopic disease. On the other hand, the RS virus might be associated with a low risk of acquiring asthma because of its considerable tendency to elicit wheezing symptoms in any individual. However, we were unable to find any statistically significant relationship between RS virus infection and asthma, and we found no significant difference between children from different seasons with regard to asthma at follow-up. Similarly, in a prospective 12-year follow-up study of children with wheezy bronchitis, the outcome was no different in terms of asthma or allergy for those who wheezed initially in association with an infection caused by the RS virus, parainfluenza or the ECHO virus (2) . In a recent study, Rylander et al. found that RS virus infection in early infancy was more frequently related to only occasional subsequent wheezing than to subsequent recurrent wheezing (24) .",
