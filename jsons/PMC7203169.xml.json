            "text": "While we are writing this commentary from Italy (April 10th), it appears that the number of people tested positive to the virus in the United States has almost quadrupled the number of people found positive in our country; however, Italy counts a disproportionately high number of deaths. China \u2013 the country where everything reportedly originated \u2013 has now smaller figures than those of the US, Italy, Spain, and Germany. These countries, together, make more than one million people detected as infected (Worldometers, 2020). Not much can be said about the reliability of these figures or their comparability. It is good to say that the numbers are based on subjects who tested positive to the swab. Unfortunately, Italy has lost the opportunity to keep reliable records of those subjects. So, it is not known what is the percentage of those who repeated the test several times but are represented as different individuals; equally unknown, because not standardized, are the criteria for which the tests were performed, if to patients with initial symptoms (Fever? Fever and coughing? Fever, coughing, and dyspnea? What?); with \u201cfull-blown\u201d clinical syndromes (severe symptomatology); to individuals potentially exposed by contiguity or direct contact (living in the same environment does not necessarily imply proximity or contact), etc. In essence, it is not known in which of these situations the swabs have been made. In this way \u2013 we believe \u2013 a big opportunity to study contagion modalities has been lost. Each region of Italy has run autonomous strategies to protect its citizens and counteract the disease. This has applied also to test-related policies. Thus, aggregating data from regions looks like a problematic, though unreliable, process.",

Unfortunately, this elementary strategy to guarantee that health professionals were sufficiently protected toward the virus was not applied with due care, and up to date the number of doctors who died from the infection during their professional activity is unbearable (109 victims, at the time of writing). The number of other health workers who have lost their life is also tragically unbearable: 28. It has been reported that the costs involved in performing the tests in appropriate numbers (at least to all health professionals and people presenting with light symptoms) are too heavy, and the availability of skilled technicians and reagents for carrying out the tests is scarce.",

For the moment, we must overcome the crisis, but there could be a lot to say, on a clinical level, on that of the organization of services, and on how to protect the life of our older adults. The latter have been too affected by imprudent and superficial colleagues to feel accepted by the community again; in a few days, in deciding if the death was \u201cby coronavirus\u201d or \u201cwith coronavirus,\u201d we have undone decades of geriatric education, but above all, we have destroyed a fundamental relationship of trust. How will we approach patients if they are now convinced that today we ask for their age to make critical decisions (intubation) and maybe tomorrow the administration of expensive drugs? A discrepancy between the gift of a long life and public acceptance of older adults is increasingly noticeable and clearly expressed by the deprecated document on \u201cdamages caused by longevity,\u201d which Christine Lagarde (now the president of the European Central Bank) spoke about a few years ago (2012): \u201cOld people live too long and this is a risk for the global economy.

So they keep the sick \u2013 especially if a senior \u2013 in their homes, assist them with fear and affection until the negative or positive resolution of the clinical picture. There is no mention of swabs or blood chemistry analyses, let alone CT or other scans. Our fellow citizens risk ending their lives without even being told what is happening to them. Many seniors live alone; many have limited or no familiarity with the Internet and are poorly connected with other family or community members (Newman and Zainal, 2020).

Frail older adults are certainly the subjects who have suffered the most from the difficulties of the Italian health system. In cities of Lombardy such as Bergamo and Brescia, the deaths have followed at an impressive rate giving rise to sad images in the televisions of the Italians of long lines of military trucks carrying coffins to incinerators, often very far from the place of origin of the deceased. As reported elsewhere (Trabucchi and De Leo, in press), in just 20 days, in the nursing homes of the province of Bergamo (Lombardy), which have a total accommodation capacity of 6,400 beds, there were more than 600 deaths, which is a hecatomb. The real dimensions of the phenomenon will only be known after some time; it is probable that the number of infected people is far greater than that officially reported. It is also likely that the number of deaths is far greater than that officially attributed to COVID-19. No attention was paid to those who manage the residences, no support in terms of means of protection, the possibility of making swabs, or even economic support in the face of damage caused by the release of beds caused by the death of guests. The access of new guests has been blocked, but the residences are increasingly pressed to admit elderly people discharged from hospitals. The staff is exhausted, as a consequence of heroic commitment. In small communities, the warmth that stirs around the residences compensates for the solitude of guests and operators, but this is not the case in large centers, where the bigger turnover of personnel makes the atmosphere more impersonal. In any case, since doctors and other operators get sick in rapid progression \u2013 and despite the extreme commitment of those on duty \u2013 guests feel progressively more fearful and abandoned.",

Schematically, the hospital system moves according to this model: (a) the emergency department, where patients arrive after days spent at home, sometimes already exhausted by the disease. It is rarely possible to send them back home: in most cases, they are kept under observation, waiting for a bed; (b) resuscitation units, where patients are intubated and followed mainly by doctors specialized in anesthesia and resuscitation; and (c) departments where patients are treated with oxygen therapy (with different levels of intensity) and checked for overall health conditions, including psychological problems. At this point in time, all remaining wards for the management of the diseases that \u201cnormally\u201d refer to hospitals are in progressive reduction. To cope with the emergency, resuscitation units were built in record time, and entire hospitals were reconverted into the care of COVID-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has found the country largely unprepared and unable to provide the necessary protection in time even to its health workers, resulting in serious shortcomings regarding the supply of eyeglasses, masks, gloves, and gowns. As said, this has resulted in the loss of far too many health professionals\u2019 lives. The very serious difficulties in assisting critical situations, combined with the scarcity of places suitable for the reception of patients in severe conditions and the lack of a sufficient number of ventilators, have given rise to very painful ethical choices for health professionals on whom to privilege in the care with available equipment (Rosenbaum, 2020).",

We need to activate all possible opportunities to offer help, at least in the form of tele-assistance, to our patients (Krysinska and De Leo, 2007). Psychological support should be made available to all via NGOs and public services, with contact with psychiatrists and other physicians actively established. As much as possible, health professionals should contact their patients and make the continuity of care a reality as soon as possible. Active outreach seems to be imperative, especially for older adults (De Leo et al., 2002), in order to counteract feelings of abandonment and disempowerment that COVID-19 is imposing on all community members, especially to the most fragile ones.",
