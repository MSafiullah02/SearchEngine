            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) belongs to a group of RNA viruses that establish persistent infections. A proposed strategy for evading immunity during persistent PRRSV infection is by preventing the induction of IFN activity in pigs and/or by blocking the activation of antiviral proteins in permissive cells. IFN-\u2425 mRNA expression was observed in the lymph nodes and lungs of pigs infected with wild-type PRRSV strain SDSU-23983. Pretreatment of MARC-145 cells with IFN-\u2425 inhibited wild-type (SDSU-23983 P6) and culture-adapted (SDSU-23983 P136) PRRS viruses in a dose-dependent manner and at relatively low concentrations. The effect of IFN-\u2425 on virus replication included reductions in the number of infected cells, virus yield, and RNA content in single cells. Virus replication was partially restored by the addition of 2-aminopurine (2-AP), an inhibitor of dsRNA inducible protein kinase (PKR). The addition of 2-AP also restored the viral RNA content per cell to near normal levels, suggesting that inhibition of viral RNA synthesis was through PKR. The principal difference between P6 and P136 isolates was the recovery of P136 replication with lower concentrations of 2-AP. Immunostaining with anti-PKR antibody showed a redistribution of PKR from the cytoplasm into nucleoli of infected cells.",

Studies suggest that PRRSV may avoid IFN by preventing its induction in macrophages. Both type-I and type-II IFNs efficiently inhibit PRRSV replication in macrophages; however, small amounts of IFN are found in PRRSV-infected pigs and infected macrophages in culture [2, 5, 52] . Since PRRSV-specific cell-mediated immunity is present during infection, it is assumed that IFN-\u2425, a product of activated T cells and NK cells, is present in infected pigs [4, 10] . However, nothing has been reported regarding the induction of IFN-\u2425 in PRRSV-infected pigs or the mechanism of IFN-\u2425-inhibition of virus replication. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the production of IFN-\u2425 in pigs following infection with PRRSV and to characterize the mechanism of IFN-\u2425 action following infection of MARC-145 cells with wild-type and culture adapted PRRSV isolates. The results show that IFN-\u2425 efficiently inhibits PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells, and at least part of the antiviral activity may be through PKR.",

All P6-infected piglets (n = 7) were positive for PRRSV at the time of necropsy (10 days after birth) and exhibited typical congenital PRRSV pathology, including microscopic lesions in lungs and lymph nodes. The piglets born to the P136-infected sow (n = 7) showed no signs of PRRS and were negative for virus at the time of necropsy, confirming that this virus was rapidly cleared from the mother and did not cross the placenta. Three pigs from each of the P6 and P136 groups were randomly chosen for analysis of cytokine mRNA expression in lungs and mandibular lymph nodes. IFN-\u2425 mRNA expression was detected in the lymph nodes from two of the 3 pigs infected with the wild-type P6 virus (Fig. 1) . A third P6 pig showed no IFN-\u2425 mRNA in lymph node; however, IFN-\u2425 mRNA was detected in the lungs.

However, the intracellular distribution of PKR was dramatically different in PRRSV-infected cells. In a representative experiment (Fig. 5E ) PKR immunofluorescence was still present in the cytoplasm, but with increased fluorescence around the perinuclear region and within the nucleoli of P6-infected cells (Fig. 5E ). Similar results were observed in cells infected with P136. Incubation with 10 mM 2-AP prior to infection with P6 did not alter the pattern of PKR staining, suggesting that PKR activation was not required for nucleolar localization. Interestingly, the intracellular distributions of PKR and PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) proteins were almost identical (compare Fig. 5B and E) . To determine a possible association between PKR and N protein in the absence of infection, we performed a similar experiment that expressed the N protein fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). A representative result, presented in Fig. 4C and F, showed N-EGFP fluorescence in the nucleolus and cytoplasm; whereas, PKR remained in the cytoplasm. Since the N-EGFP fusion construct may not be representative the native N protein, we repeated the experiment using a construct that expressed only the N protein, which was detected using FITC-SDOW-17. Under these conditions the N and PKR proteins did not co-localize to the nucleolus (data not shown).",

Even though we demonstrated the effectiveness of IFN in inhibiting PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells, little is known regarding the properties of the macrophages supporting PRRSV replication in vivo. In infected pigs, PRRSV replication is initially found in all organs and tissues [29] . During the long asymptomatic stage of infection, virus replication is restricted to a subpopulation of cells located in tonsil and lymph nodes (personal observation), suggesting that these cells may be more resistant to IFN-\u2425, even when exposed to local elevations of cytokines from activated T cells. This observation is similar to studies of LDV infection of mice. LDV normally replicates in a subpopulation of macrophages, but in some strains of mice infects motor neurons causing paralysis. Injection of mice with IFN-\u2425 prior to infection inhibits virus replication in motor neurons without significantly affecting the overall level of viremia [11] . We propose a model in which the induction of IFN-\u2425 production during PRRSV infection is sufficient to suppress virus replication in permissive cells in non-lymphoid organs, but does not affect replication in a small subpopulation of permissive cells in lymph nodes and tonsil. The identity of this PRRSV-permissive population remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Anti-viral proteins, including PKR, 2-5A synthetase and Mx are up-regulated in response to IFN [9, 25, 27] . PKR, after binding viral RNA, is autophosphorylated on serine and threonine residues and inhibits translation by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of eIF2. Phosphorylation of PKR is inhibited by 2-AP, an ATP analog. The addition of 2-AP to cells pre-incubated with 100 U/ml IFN-\u2425 partially recovered PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 3) . These results demonstrate that at least, in part, the interferon-induced anti-PRRSV activity may occur through the PKR pathway. The ability of 2-AP to partially restore viral RNA synthesis IN IFN-treated cells supports the work of deBoon et al. [20] who concluded that ongoing protein synthesis is required for the production of arterivirus RNAs. One explanation for the failure of 2-AP to completely restore virus replication is the activation of other antiviral pathways not regulated by PKR. For example the activation of the 2-5A synthetase pathway can be identified by the presence of degraded forms of both viral and ribosomal RNAs [48] . Degraded RNA was not detected in Northern blots (see Fig. 6A ) in total RNA from PRRSV infected cultures (personal observation). Recently, Zhang et al. [56] reported increased expression of Mx1 in cultured macrophages infected with PRRSV. A role for Mx in the inhibition of PRRSV replication has not been demonstrated. Another explanation for the failure of 2-AP to restore PRRSV replication is the inhibition of 2-AP sensitive phosphorylation event required for virus replication. For example, 25 mM 2-AP prevents the phosphorylation of the PE2/E2 envelope glycoprotein, which is required for the production of infectious progeny [30] .",

In MARC-145 cells, we found PKR primarily concentrated in the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions (Fig. 5D ). An unexpected observation was the localization of PKR to the nucleoli of PRRSV-infected cells (Fig. 5E ). Nucleolar localization was not affected by 2-AP, suggesting that PKR activation is not necessary for nucleolar localization. This observation confirms the result of Besse et al. [8] who identified a non-phosphorylated form of PKR in the nuclei of HeLa cells. Furthermore, PKR nucleolar localization during PRRSV replication is not the result of a physical association with the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein ( Fig. 5C and F). From these results we can conclude that nucleolar localization of PKR in MARC-145 cells is dependent on PRRSV infection, but is independent of activation or an association with the nucleocapsid protein.",
