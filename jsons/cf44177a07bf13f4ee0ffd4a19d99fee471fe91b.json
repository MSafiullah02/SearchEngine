Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has been reported in Europe, America, and Asia including Thailand. The disease causes substantial losses to the swine industry in many countries. Presently, there is no effective PEDV vaccine available. In this study, we developed a plant-produced monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2C10 as a prophylactic candidate to prevent the PEDV infection. Recently, plant expression systems have gained interest as an alternative for the production of antibodies because of many advantages, such as low production cost, lack of human and animal pathogen, large scalability, etc. The 2C10 mAb was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and lettuce using geminiviral vector. After purification by protein A affinity chromatography, the antibody was tested for the binding and neutralizing activity against PEDV. Our result showed that the plant produced 2C10 mAb can bind to the virus and also inhibit PEDV infection in vitro. These results show excellent potential for a plant-expressed 2C10 as a PEDV prophylaxis and a diagnostic for PEDV infection.",

Recently, plants have been used as factories to effectively produce several recombinant proteins because of several advantages over other protein expression systems, including low manufacturing cost, high protein expression level, scalability, and lack of human and animal pathogen [17, 18] . Moreover, plants contain the posttranslational modification, which are often critical to the proper protein functions [19, 20] . The two main systems for producing proteins in plants are stable transgenic expression and transient expression. The establishment of transgenic plants is a time-consuming process with limitation of relatively low protein expression level. For transient expression, plant viral vectors were developed to increase the protein expression level [21] . Among different viral vectors, geminiviral vector was developed to produce several proteins in plants such as antigens and antibodies [22] [23] [24] .",

N. benthamiana is the most common host plant for transient expression because of its high biomass yield. Lettuce is another rapid-growing plant that also produces high biomass and contains lower amount of phenolics and alkaloids, compared to tobacco plants. This is the advantage for the protein purification downstream process [24] . Lettuce was obtained commercially from a local grocery store with romaine lettuce labeled on the package. We tested the 2C10 mAb expressed in N. benthamiana and lettuce for PEDV binding and neutralizing activity. This plantproduced mAb can be applied to use as diagnostic kit or prophylactic treatment for PEDV infection, which will be very useful for the swine industry.",

The fused genes were inserted into geminiviral replicon vector (pBY030.2R) (\u25b6 Fig. 2 ) and introduced to Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. The 2C10 mAb was expressed in N. benthamiana by co-infiltration with the mixture of A. tumefaciens containing pBY2C10-kappa, pBY2C10kamma, and p19. The p19 used in this study was the gene silencing inhibitor p19 from tomato bushy stunt virus using the nonreplicating expression vector. At day 5 post-infiltration, the 2C10 mAb in plant extract was detected by western blot analysis using mouse anti-human IgG antiserum, Fc specific and mouse antikappa light chain antiserum. The result showed that 2C10 IgG was produced in N. benthamiana, containing both heavy chain and light chain at approximately 50 and 25 kDa in reducing condition, respectively (\u25b6 Fig. 3 A) . The assembly of 2C10 IgG was determined after protein A affinity purification by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The 2C10 mAb purified from plant proteins were analyzed under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Under reducing condition, two bands of heavy and light chains were detected at 50 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively (\u25b6 Fig. 3 B) , while the purified protein had the band at 150 kDa (\u25b6 Fig. 3 B) , which confirms the assembly of the whole IgG molecule.",

Previous study reported that there are over one million piglet deaths from PEDV infection during the outbreak in China in 2010, which created large economic losses [28] . For PEDV prevention, there are different types of PEDV vaccine commercially, including live viral vaccine and inactivated virus [29, 30] . However, these vaccines did not significantly reduce the morbidity rate due to diarrhea, because several factors including route of administration and strains of vaccine virus affected the poor lactogenic immunogenicity of these commercial vaccines [31] . Another potential approach to protection of neonatal piglets is passive immunity induced by effective quantities of protective antibodies obtained from sow colostrum and milk. Artificial passive immunization by oral administration of specific antibodies represents an attractive approach against gastrointestinal pathogens such as PEDV [26] . Several PEDV neutralizing antibodies were developed previously [15, 16, 32, 33] , and they might be good candidates for use as PEDV prophylactic agents.

If we get the promising result, the porcine IgG constant region will be used for further study.

After purification process, the assembly of full-size 2C10 IgG (150 kDa) produced from both plants was detected in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing condition (\u25b6 Fig. 3 B and Fig. 4 B) . The quantity of corrected IgG was found in tobacco more than lettuce. However, the antibodies produced from both plants clearly showed binding to PEDV in vitro (\u25b6 Fig. 5 ). Our result showed that the binding of plant-produced 2C10 mAb to PEDV increased approximately 1.7 times. However, the binding of another protein, GST-truncated S, is similar to negative control (the binding ratio is approximately 1).

In this study, the neutralizing activity of plant-produced 2C10 was not strong compared to the neutralizing activity of 2C10 mAb against KPED-9 strain in previous study [15] . The level of neutral- izing activity might be different depending on the strain of the virus. This data confirmed that the plant-produced 2C10 mAb neutralized PEDV infection in vitro, suggesting the potential to use as PEDV prophylactic agent. Previous data reported that protecting suckling piglets from PEDV infection also depends on the secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies in milk [41] . The sIgA is more resistant to protease than IgG, which is suitable to use as the oral vaccine [42] . Therefore sIgA is a good approach to use as a prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Plants were shown to be an effective platform for sIgA production [43] [44] [45] . Thus, we can develop this 2C10 mAb to produce sIgA from plants in the future, which will be more effective PEDV prophylactic.",
