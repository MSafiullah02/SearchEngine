The ability of 18F-FDG PET/CT to identify sites of inflammation and infection is mainly related to the glycolytic activity of the cells involved in the inflammatory response. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that cells involved in infection and inflammation, especially neutrophils and the monocyte/macrophage family, are able to express high levels of glucose transporters and hexokinase activity. Notably, 18F-FDG PET/CT may early detect pathophysiological changes in affected tissues in patients with infectious or inflammatory diseases and these functional changes may occur before anatomical changes detected by conventional imaging techniques. Enough evidence-based data in the literature already exist about the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis and management of several infectious and inflammatory diseases [2].",

In particular, in the most large series described by Qin et al. [3], 18F-FDG PET/CT results from four patients with suspicious COVID-19 infection were described. The patients were admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever when the COVID-19 outbreak was still unrecognized and the virus infectivity was unknown. All patients had typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia as described above. At 18F-FDG PET/CT, lung lesions were characterized by increased 18F-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated disease was absent suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism. In their conclusion, the authors suggested a potential clinical usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with suspicious COVID-19 infection, especially at early stages when clinical symptoms are not specific and differential diagnosis is challenging [3].",

There are currently no data suggesting an added value of 18F-FDG PET/CT compared to chest CT in the management or outcome of patients with COVID-19 infection. Conversely, 18F-FDG PET/CT is more complex than chest CT leading a possible increased risk of disease spreading due to the longer time of 18F-FDG PET/CT procedure compared to chest CT. Most importantly, specific safety and prevention protocols should be followed in the Nuclear Medicine departments during the outbreak of COVID-19 to allow for safe nuclear medicine diagnosis and treatment procedures [4, 5].",
