            "text": "With the increasing demand for millions of COVID-19 screenings, Computed Tomography (CT) based test has emerged as a promising alternative to the gold standard RT-PCR test. However, it is primarily provided in hospital setting due to the need for expensive equipment and experienced radiologists. An accurate, rapid yet inexpensive test that is suitable for COVID-19 population screenings at mobile, urgent and primary care clinics is urgently needed. We present COVID-MobileXpert: a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) based mobile app that can use noisy snapshots of chest X-ray (CXR) for point-of-care COVID-19 screening. We design and implement a novel three-player knowledge transfer and distillation (KTD) framework including a pre-trained attending physician (AP) network that extracts CXR imaging features from large scale of lung disease CXR images, a fine-tuned resident fellow (RF) network that learns the essential CXR imaging features to discriminate COVID-19 from pneumonia and/or normal cases using a small amount of COVID-19 cases, and a trained lightweight medical student (MS) network that performs on-device COVID-19 screening. To accommodate the need for screening using noisy snapshots of CXR images, we employ novel loss functions and training schemes for the MS network to learn the robust imaging features for accurate on-device COVID-19 screening. We demonstrate the strong potential of COVID-MobileXpert for rapid deployment via extensive experiments with diverse MS network architecture, CXR imaging quality, and tuning parameter settings. The source code of cloud and mobile based models are available from the following url:https://github.com/xinli0928/COVID-Xray.",

The gold standard screening approach based on RT-PCR demonstrates a good accuracy but subject to significant limitations of high cost and slow turnover time, making it not scalable to the ever-increasing population at risk [1] . Thanks to high-volume testing machines and new rapid tests, the total tests topped 1.4 million as of early April [2] . However, millions of tests are still urgently needed as the virus keeps communities across the country in lockdown and hospitals are overwhelmed with patients. Alternative nucleic acid and serology based tests, Computed Tomography (CT) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] based approaches have also been widely adopted for testing COVID-19 cases, which have been shown better sensitivity and specificity compared with nucleic acid based tests [8] despite mixed results exist [9] . Up to date most of medical imaging based diagnostic tools are based on CT and deployed in hospitals where expensive CT equipment and experienced radiologists are available. For example, Alibaba's model [10] and Infervision system [11] both are trained on more than 5,000 confirmed cases and deployed at dozens of hospitals in China.",

At present, the bottleneck lies in the short of board certified radiologists who are capable of differentiating massive COVID-19 positive cases from other lung diseases and normal conditions directly from CXR images, either those from PACS system or noisy snapshots. The intensive development of deep neural network (DNN) powered CXR image analysis has seen the unprecedented success in automatic classification and segmentation of lung diseases [12, 13] . Using the cloud solutions such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, or even on-premise computing clusters to train a sophisticated DNN (e.g., DenseNet-121 [14] ) with dozens of millions of parameters and hundreds of layers via billions of operations for both training and inference, these large scale Artificial Intelligence (AI) models achieve amazing performance that even outperforms board certified radiologists in some well-defined tasks [15] .",

However, up to date on-device medical imaging applications are very limited to basic functions, such as DICOM image view, which allows mobile access to PACS system outside a clinic via a network connection. As medical resources in hospitals are falling short under the unprecedented crisis, CXR based population screening emerges as a cost-effective approach to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in under resourced care facilities. The mobile AI screening approach is expected to not only protect patient privacy, but also assist the first-responder or the caregiver to quickly determine the acuity level with the absence of a board certified radiologist. However, a major challenge that prevents wide adoption of the mobile AI screening approach is lack of lightweight yet accurate and robust neural networks for on-device COVID-19 screening using noisy CXR images often shot with a mobile device.",

The unique features of the KTD framework are knowledge transfer from a large-scale existing lung disease images to enhance the discrimination between COVID-19 and non-COVID pneumonia and novel loss functions to generate refined soft labels (predicted probabilities) to improve knowledge distillation to the MS network, enabling accurate on-device screening.",

Here we present COVID-MobileXpert, a novel mobile AI approach for CXR based COVID-19 screening to be reliably deployed at mobile devices for point-of-care testing. It enjoys the following advantages: 1) accurately detecting positive COVID-19 cases particularly from closely related pneumonia cases; 2) identifying the important regions on CXR images that correspond to (hopefully responsible for) the positive screening results; and 3) robust performance on noisy CXR snapshots recaptured using mobile devices.",

Using labeled medical images to train sophisticated convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often pre-trained on a large number of natural images, the CNN performance on disease classification has achieved the level that is comparable to or even outperforms the board certified human radiologists [16, 21, 22] . Wang et al. [12] created the ChestX-ray8 data set of 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images from 32,717 unique patients, labeled with the eight diseases minded from the corresponding radiological reports, and trained a unified deep CNN model by using weight parameters from AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet-16 and ResNet-50, pre-trained using ImageNet, followed re-training the weights in penultimate layer. Using this data set, Rajpurkar et al. [16] trained a DenseNet-121 based ChestXNet model, which can detect pneumonia from CXR's at a level exceeding practicing radiologists. In [22] , authors trained a 169-layer DenseNet model using a large labeled dataset of musculoskeletal radiographs containing 40,561 bone X-ray's from 14,863 studies to detect and localize abnormalities, and demonstrated a comparable performance to the best radiologist. To overcome the issue of label scarcity in medical images, semi-supervised [23] , multiple-instance [24] and transfer learning [25] techniques are widely applied to alleviate the need for radiologist labeled images without compromising the performance [26] .",

            "text": "In the past a few weeks, CNNs have been successfully employed to distinguish COVID-19 from other community acquired pneumonia [6, 7, 27] . Using a collected data set of 4,356 chest CT exams from 3,322 patients, Li et al [4] trained COVNET, a ResNet-50 based CNN model, to achieve an impressive Area Under the ROC (AUROC) value over 0.95. Huang et al [28] used deep learning based segmentation and classification approaches to quantify the stages of lung burden change in patients with COVID-19 using serial CT scan. Although CXR images are generally considered less sensitive than the 3D chest CT scans, recent CXR based studies demonstrate a strong potential for being a point-of-care testing approach for COVID-19 screening using publicly available data sets [29] . Ghoshal et al [30] investigated how dropweight based Bayesian CNNs can tackle the uncertainties associated with small size of labeled images and found it is strongly correlated with the accuracy of prediction. Narin et al [31] experimented their CNN based ResNet-50, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2 architectures to classify COVID-19 and normal classes of CXR images. Similar to [6] in CT related studies, they pre-trained the models using ImageNet to alleviate the need for labeled COVID images. Zhang et al [32] adopted a similar approach in collecting the public data, yet employed an unsupervised anomaly detection approach that detects COVID-19 images as outliers. These studies have demonstrated the strong potential of the CXR based AI approach for point-of-care testing. However, up to date, all the AI models trained for COVID screening, either using CT scans or CXR images, are full DNNs that are not suitable to deploy on resource-constrained mobile devices.",

MnasNet and MobileNetV3 are representative models generated via automatic neural architecture search (NAS) whereas all other networks are manually designed [39] . Due to the practical hardware resource constraint of mobile devices, natural image classification and segmentation performance have been compared based on accuracy, energy consumption, runtime and memory complexity that no single network has demonstrated a superior performance in all tasks [40] . Besides tailor-made network architectures for mobile devices, compression the full DNN at the different stages of training also stands as a promising alternative. For in-training model compression, for example, Chen et al [41] designed a novel convolution operation via factorizing the mixed feature maps by their frequencies to store and process feature maps that vary spatially slower at a lower spatial resolution to reduce both memory and computation cost of the image classification. Post-training or fine tuning model compression techniques such as quantization [42] and/or pruning techniques [43] are often used to reduce the model size at the expense of reduced prediction accuracy. Wang et al [44] demonstrated using 8-bit floating point numbers for representing weight parameters without compromising the model's accuracy. Lou et al [45] automatically searched a suitable precision for each weight kernel and chose another precision for each activation layer and demonstrate a reduced inference latency and energy consumption while achieving the same inference accuracy. Tung and Mori [46] combined network pruning and weight quantization in a single learning framework to compress several DNNs without satisfying accuracy.",

Thus the student model is trained to mimic the outputs of the teacher model as well as to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the true labels and predictive probabilities (soft labels). Knowledge distillation yields compact student models that outperform the compact models trained from scratch without a teacher model [48] . Goldblum et al [49] attempted to encourage the student network to output correct labels using the training cases crafted with a moderate adversarial attack budget to demonstrate the robustness of knowledge distillation methods. Unlike the natural images, on-device classification of medical images remain largely an uncharted territory due to the following unique challenges: 1) label scarcity in medical images significantly limits generalizability of the machine learning system; 2) vastly similar and dominant fore-and background in medical images make it hard samples for learning the discriminating features between different disease classes; and 3) excessive noises added particularly to the image recaptured from a snapshot can make CXR images and noisy snapshots more discriminate than that between different disease classes. To tackle these unique challenges we propose a novel three-player framework for training a lightweight network towards accurate and hardware friendly on-device CXR image classification.",

Different from recent studies [29, 52] that pre-train the models with natural image data sets such as ImageNet [53] , we pre-train the DenseNet-121 based AP network using the more related ChestX-ray8 data set [12] of 108,948 lung disease cases to extract the CXR imaging features of lung diseases instead of generic natural imaging features. Specifically, beyond the dense block, we employ a shared fully connected layer for extracting the general CXR imaging feature and 8 fully connected disease-specific layers (including pneumonia as one disease layer) to extract disease-specific features (Figure 1 ). After pre-training with the large ChestX-ray8 data set, the weights defining the general CXR imaging feature and the pneumonia disease feature are transferred to fine-tune the DenseNet-121 based RF network using a smaller compiled data set of 3 classes of CXR images or noisy snapshots, i.e., COVID-19, normal and pneumonia. Collectively a total of 537 CXR images are used for fine-tunning, validation and testing of the RF network. The latter is randomly initialized using two sets of weight parameters corresponding to normal and COVID-19 classes with the initial values of other weight parameters transferred from the pre-trained source model. The network is trained with Adam optimizer for 50 epochs with a mini-batch size of 32. The parameter values that give rise to the best performance on validation dataset are used for testing. The RF network is then used to train the lightweight MS network, e.g., MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2 or SqueezeNet, via knowledge distillation. In order to accommodate the real-world need in diverse healthcare settings, for example, CXR images from the on-premise PACS system at hospitals or noisy snapshots recaptured in mobile devices at the bedside, we train the MS network using CXR image and noisy snapshots respectively and assess their individual performance.",

Motivated by this, we use an in-house developed loss function, i.e., Probabilistically Compact (PC) loss, for generating the soft labels from the RF model and compared with ArcFace [55] , the additive angular margin loss for deep face recognition, using the classical softmax loss as the baseline. Both PC and ArcFace losses are designed for improving classification performance on hard samples. PC loss is to encourage the maximized margin between the most probable soft label (predictive probability) and the first several most probable labels whereas ArcFac loss is to encourage widening the geodesic distance gap between the closest soft labels. In terms of predicted probabilities, DNN robustness is beneficial from the large gap between f y (x) and f k (x) (k = y), where f y (x) represents the true class and f k (x) (k = y) represents the most probable class. Indeed, theoretical study [56] in deep learning shows that the gap f y (x) \u2212 max k f k (x) can be used to measure the generalizability of deep neural networks.",

In order to systemically assess the performance of our COVID-19 on-device screening app, we select six mobile systems released following a chronic order, i.e., Nexus One / Nexus S (low-end); Pixel/ Pixel 2 (mid-range) and Pixel 2 XL/ Pixel 3 XL (high-end). Using Pytorch Mobile framework, we deploy the three MS networks to the six Android based mobile systems and compare the resource consumption with regard to CPU, Memory and Energy usages. Figure 6 describes a workflow to build an Android App based on the MS networks for on-device screening.",

Thus, the high accuracy achieved by MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2 is at the cost of high resource consumption. Within each app, we observe a downward trend in resource consumption following the chronic order, reflecting a continuous improvement of mobile device hardware. Overall, MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2 based COVID screening apps are more suitable for high-performing mobile device whereas the latter is a good choice for COVID-MobileXpert deployment due to its high accuracy achieved by lower resource consumption. SqueezeNet is more suitable for low-end mobile device with both lower accuracy and resource consumption.",

In the related task of on-device natural image classification, the teacher network is pre-trained with ImageNet and distill the knowledge to a lightweight student network (e.g., MobileNetV2). This two-player framework, although is seemingly successful, can be problematic for on-device medical imaging based screening described herein. The large gap between natural images and the medical images of a specific disease such as COVID-19 makes the knowledge distillation less effective as it is supposed to be. The small number of labeled COVID images for training further aggravate the situation.",

Different from what have been extensively investigated focusing on the impact of distillation strength and temperature, we uncover a pivotal role of employing novel loss functions in refining the quality of knowledge to be distilled. Hence our three-player framework provides a more effective way to train the compact on-device model using smaller labeled data set while preserving the performance. When tested on an array of mobile devices, ShuffleNetV2 and MobileNetV2 demonstrate a better performance at the cost of demanding more systems resources.",
