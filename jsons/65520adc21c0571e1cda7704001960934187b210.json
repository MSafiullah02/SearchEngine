These problems would not exist if the paranasal sinuses were accessible to direct examination and to noninvasive sampling for microbial culture. Because they are not, for diagnosis physicians have had to rely on clinical evaluations that are either insensitive or nonspecific [1] and on imagining studies, which are also insensitive or nonspecific.",

Thus, the common cold is in reality a viral rhinosinusitis (VRS), not simply a rhinitis as traditionally held. Not appreciating this difference has led to confusion, since historically the term acute sinusitis has been used to identify what is considered a bacterial infection of the sinus. Undoubtedly this term has often been misapplied to cases of viral etiology or of a combined viral-bacterial etiology. Without the benefit of sinus puncture, these distinctions cannot be made with accuracy.",

The viral component will contribute to the overall severity and duration of the illness and thus complicate the diagnosis and confound the assessment of antimicrobial effectiveness. Likewise, cases of pure VRS that are misdiagnosed as acute bacterial sinusitis will be a cause of confusion in case management, and these cases will contaminate patient samples in clinical trials of antimicrobial therapy. The perspective provided by the new information on VRS leads to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of ACAS and permits the development of improved approaches to diagnosis and management, which will be discussed in this review.",

In 1707, William Cowper developed a method of treating sinusitis by draining the antrum through the alveolus after removal of a tooth. Following this, John Hunter (1728-1793) recommended opening the antrum by way of the middle meatus, and Gooch, who died in 1780, and later, Mikulicz (1896) introduced antral puncture through the inferior meatus [4] . In this same period, Caldwell (1893) and Luc (1897) described an approach to the maxillary antrum via the canine fossa. These procedures were used for diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic maxillary sinus infection. Drainage and irrigation were a mainstay of treatment for acute and subacute cases, while creation of a permanent drainage site was employed for cases that had become chronic.",

The composition of nasal secretions has received considerable study, but secretions from the sinus cavity itself have not received comparable attention because of the difficulty of obtaining them, especially from healthy persons.

Uncomplicated rhinovirus colds have a median duration of 1 week (figure 7) [64, 65] . Most colds, if still symptomatic, are improved by the end of 1 week, so the worsening or persistence of symptoms raises the suspicion of a complication. In addition, sinus-puncture studies have shown that for ~60% of patients who initially present with VRS and whose sinonasal symptoms do not abate after 1 week, a bacterial aspirate culture will be positive [53] . Complications ACABS may lead to intracranial, orbital, and respiratory complications. The intracranial complications include meningitis, brain abscess, subdural empyema, and cavernous-sinus and cortical-vein thrombosis. Orbital complications are most common in young children and include orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, and orbital abscess. Sinusitis also is associated with the onset or exacerbation of asthma and bronchitis. Sinopulmonary disease is a well-recognized combination, especially when the condition has become chronic.",

When a lO-day course of therapy with an antimicrobial that has an appropriate [53] antibacterial spectrum has been used (at the correct dosage), a ~90% bacteriologic cure rate has been routinely obtained (table 12). In formal clinical trials of antimicrobial therapy for ACABS, pretreatment bacterial aspirate culture is desirable to exclude the cases of pure VRS that will invariably contaminate the patient sample if inclusion criteria are based solely on clinical and imaging parameters. Posttreatment aspirate culture is also necessary to determine effectiveness of therapy because of the recognized difficulty in accurately monitoring the clinical course of sinusitis [67] . This difficulty is due to the dual viral-bacterial etiology of the infection and to its self-limited natural history. Currently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not require posttreatment aspirate cultures for approval of a sinusitis-treatment indication. In addition, some reports of \"bacteriologic cures\" have appeared in the literature, involving cases in which posttherapy aspirate cultures were not performed; the \"bacteriologic cure\" assessment was based on clinical response, not findings of aspirate culture.",

Thus, there is the possibility that antihistamine therapy may reduce the amount of mucus that accumulates in the sinus cavity during acute sinusitis.

The Office of Continuing Medical Education, UCLA School of Medicine, designates this educational activity for up to 1 hour in category I credit towards the Physician's Recognition Award of the American Medical Association. Each physician should claim only those hours of credit that he/she actually spent in the educational activity.To earn credit, read the State-of-the-Art Clinical Article carefully and answer the following questions. Mark your answers by circling the correct responses on the answer card (usually found toward the front of the issue), and mail this card after affixing first-class postage. To earn credit, a minimum score of 80% must be obtained.Certificates of CME credit will be awarded on a per-volume (biannual) basis. Each answer card must be submitted within 3 months of the date of the issue.This program is made possible by an educational grant from Roche Laboratories. ",
