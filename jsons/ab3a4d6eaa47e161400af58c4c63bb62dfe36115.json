The assay is performed using a simple sample-toanswer platform with results available in approximately 69 min. The pathogens identified are adenovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus HKU1, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, human metapneumovirus A and B, influenza A, influenza A H1, influenza A H3, influenza A H1N1/2009, influenza B, parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 2, parainfluenza virus 3, parainfluenza virus 4, rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This multicenter evaluation provides data obtained from 1,994 prospectively collected and 310 retrospectively collected (archived) NPS specimens with performance compared to that of the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel, version 1.7. The overall percent agreement between QIAstat-Dx RP and the comparator testing was 99.5%. In the prospective cohort, the QIAstat-Dx RP demonstrated a positive percent agreement of 94.0% or greater for the detection of all but four analytes: coronaviruses 229E, NL63, and OC43 and rhinovirus/enterovirus. The test also demonstrated a negative percent agreement of \u054697.9% for all analytes. The QIAstat-Dx RP is a robust and accurate assay for rapid, comprehensive testing for respiratory pathogens.",

Among the viruses detected in this multiplex panel, there is substantial evidence that the rapid molecular diagnosis of influenza virus infections impacts patient outcomes for both adult and pediatric populations (3, 6, 9) . The QIAstat-Dx RP has a total of 4 targets for the detection of FLU A: a paninfluenza A target and specific targets for 3 subtypes, influenza A H1, influenza A H1 2009, and influenza A H3. Of the 251 influenza A-positive detections, a total of 248 (98.8%) had additional subtype-specific detections (85 specific detections for H1N1 2009 and 163 for H3). There were no detections of seasonal H1N1. Three (1.2%) influenza A positives had no associated specific detections. This could be due to virus levels below the limit of detection for the type-specific assays. However, it indicates the detection of a novel influenza A type, and this should be considered when seen in clinical use (17, 18 A relatively small number of bacterial detections were found in the prospective cohort, as has been seen in other studies with multiplex testing (16, 19) . The most common of the bacterial targets was M. pneumoniae, with 24 detections, more than the 19 detected with FARPv1.7. However, it should be noted that the use of an NP specimen for the detection of M. pneumoniae may be suboptimal, particularly when diagnosing lower-respiratory-tract infection (20, 21) . For B. pertussis, discrepancies between the QIAstat-Dx RP and the comparator method were not unexpected, as the QIAstat-Dx RP targets the multicopy insertion sequence (IS481) that is present in several Bordetella species (B. pertussis, B. holmesii, and B. bronchiseptica), whereas the comparator targets the single-copy promoter region of the pertussis toxin gene and is designed to be specific to the detection of B. pertussis. The use of the single-copy toxin gene target has been shown to be less sensitive than the use of IS481 (22, 23) . The assay used for discordant analysis calls out the individual Bordetella species (B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. holmesii). The B. pertussis target is also the toxin promoter region and, thus, would be a single-copy gene. A total of 6 QIAstat-Dx RP FP results were found for B. pertussis for both arms of the study ( Table 4 ). Five of these samples were available for further analysis; only one was confirmed using the discordant testing with a C T value of 31.6. In examining the C T values for all the detections in the clinical trial, the discordant detections had a significantly higher median C T value than the concordant positive detections (TP median C T , 26.2; FP median C T , 33.0; P \u03ed 0.008) (Table S1 ). Thus, some of the FP may have been missed by both the comparator and discordant analysis assays based on the lower sensitivity of a single-copy gene target.",

(Fig. 1) . Compared to FARPv1.7, QIAstat-Dx RP involves only one step to pipette the specimen into the cartridge for loading, as there is no buffer added or any other manipulations required. This lessens manipulation and may help to reduce contamination. The run times are similar, lasting, on average, 69 and 63 min for the QIAstat-Dx RP and FARPv1.7, respectively. Both platforms allow for testing of one pouch at a time per module. In terms of reliability, the initial rate of invalid or no results on first testing for the prospective samples was 4.1% and after a second test was 0.7%. This invalid rate is comparable to those of other multiplex platforms currently available (16) . A significant benefit of the system is that it allows the user to obtain a C T value for each detected pathogen and the internal control. The comparator assay does not allow the user to see C T values. These values, while not truly quantitative, do allow a semiquantitative assessment of target amounts that can be useful in troubleshooting or other quality control measures.",

The study period bridges 17 months and includes two respiratory seasons; however, variations in circulating strains, particularly influenza A viruses, may be limited. Because the prevalence of some analytes was low in the prospective cohort, frozen retrospective samples were used to increase the numbers for positive detections. As stated above, freeze-thawing did not appear to affect performance in terms of prevalence. However, for the retrospective samples, all were tested with both the test and comparator assays on the same freeze-thaw cycle to remove this as a confounder.

Because the comparator does not provide any semiquantitative value, it is difficult to determine the relative level of virus in the 7 QIAstat-Dx FN; however, the 1 FN for the FARPv1.7 had a C T value of 20.4, suggesting it did have a significant amount of virus present.",
