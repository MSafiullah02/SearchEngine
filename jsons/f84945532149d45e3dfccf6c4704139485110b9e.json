This article reports on the progress made in the study of pathogen targets and provides highlights of a number of developments in high-throughput (HTP) technologies which have proved crucial to successful structure determination, illustrated by reference to some of the structures solved. Whilst relevance to human health and disease was the overarching criterion for target selection, a subset of targets was selected explicitly as so-called 'low-hanging fruit'. These, primarily exemplified by the Bacillus anthracis proteins (Au et al., 2006) , proved particularly valuable in validating HTP pipelines and technologies. The methods used by the various SPINE partners for target selection and other informatics aspects are described in detail in Albeck et al. (2006) .",

The two key organisms were Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and B. anthracis, which together accounted for 81% of our bacterial targets and 47% of the bacterial protein threedimensional structures solved (Table 1 ). The efforts on MTB involved six partners (Paris, Hamburg, Uppsala, Stockholm, York and the Weizmann) and especially targeted proteins from strain H37Rv. The B. anthracis project was a collabora- tive effort between the Oxford and York partners and a fuller assessment of this is given in an accompanying paper (Au et al., 2006) . In addition to these, smaller numbers of targets were selected from Campylobacter jejuni (York, Lisbon), two members of the Neisseriae family (N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae; Oxford), Escherichia coli (e.g. 0157:H7; Stockholm, Weizmann, Florence), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Lisbon) and Streptomycetes (Stockholm) and Shigella flexnin, Salmonella entrica typhimurium and Streptococcus pyogenes (Weizmann). 1.1.1. M. tuberculosis. A number of slow-growing mycobacterial species have evolved into highly successful human pathogens and are responsible for diseases such as tuberculosis (TB; M. tuberculosis and M. africanum) and leprosy (M. leprae). The World Health Organization estimates that one-third of the human population is currently infected and that one person dies roughly every 18 s (http://www.who.int) from mycobacterial diseases. There are now forms of M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB; Espinal, 2003) resistant to the two most powerful anti-TB drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin) and there is a pressing need for new drugs effective against persistent TB infection and MDR-TB. Closely related forms of mycobacteria are pathogenic to other mammalian species, e.g. M. bovis. The MTB target-selection process in Paris is illustrative of those used for this organism in SPINE and was based on comparative analyses of the complete genome sequences for two MTB strains with other bacteria and mycobacterial strains, such as M. bovis, M. bovis BCG and M. leprae, which provided detailed information about every gene in MTB. Over 300 proteins were identified that were only found in mycobacteria or actinomycetes, but were conserved in the degraded genome of M. leprae and therefore presumed to be important for bacterial viability and hence potential drug targets (Albeck et al., 2006) . In addition, the Paris laboratory targeted proteins for which structures would provide insights into MTB biology. Funding for the MTB project was far from exclusive to SPINE and came from several other sources, including other EC grants.",

York targets included proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism and sporulation, whilst Oxford targets included members of protein families well conserved across a range of pathogenic bacteria ). An additional SPINE collaboration between York and Utrecht resulted in two NMR structures of sporulation-associated aspartic acid phosphate phosphatases, neither of which could be crystallized (AB et al., 2006) , and extended the targets to the BofC (bypass of forespore C) protein from B. subtilis, an intercompartmental signalling factor expressed in the forespore (Patterson et al., 2005) , also found in B. anthracis (BA4653).",

Two members of the Neisseriae, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae, have evolved into highly successful pathogens responsible for bacterial meningitis and gonorrhoea, respectively. Although the regulatory systems of all Gram-negative bacteria share features in common with E. coli, Neisseria species display several features which are unique. These include a restricted set of sigma factors, a relatively small number of transcriptional regulators and a large number of phase variable genes. Oxford focused on the complete repertoire of transcription regulators in both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae, with a view to defining the structure-function relationships of these proteins and to provide key reagents for experimental studies of regulation. The four available complete genome sequences (Parkhill et al., 2000; Tettelin et al., 2000) of Neisseria were assessed for homologues of DNA-binding proteins with potential regulatory functions. Representative orthologues of each regulator in each genome were identified, with the genes selected in order of preference from N. meningitidis strain MC58, N. gonorrhoeae strain FA1090, N. meningitidis strain Z2491 and N. meningitidis strain FAM18, to provide a cohort of 62 DNA-binding and associated signal-transduction proteins.

No effective treatments are generally available, with the exception of the acyclovir compounds active against HSV. Thus, herpesviruses are of immediate interest to the biomedical community and in particular to the pharmaceutical industry. Barcelona and Oxford have interests in the molecular mechanisms of genome packaging and targeted a number of proteins that form the complex that packages the dsDNA genome of herpesviruses. This work demonstrated the inadequacy of the current E. coli proteinproduction pipelines for such difficult proteins (five out of six of the components are greater than 70 kDa in size and all are part of complex robust macromolecular assemblies), since all the expressed proteins were insoluble. Soluble proteins have now been produced in insect cells for some of these targets, but no structures have been determined and this work will not be considered further here. In contrast, the Grenoble group targeted EBV proteins with known enzymatic activity and ranked them based on a number of properties, prioritizing those that were small and predicted to be stable with a high secondary-structure content. Surface glycoproteins and those proteins forming multi-component complexes were explicitly excluded. Application of these selection criteria led to the structure determination of four proteins from EBV (Tarbouriech et al., 2006) .",

The first manifestation of infection is a febrile illness, with respiratory symptoms, headaches and myalgia, followed by progression to acute respiratory distress and progressive respiratory failure (Peiris et al., 2003) . The disease is caused by a coronavirus (Kuiken et al., 2003) , one of a group of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses commonly associated with enteric and respiratory disease (Ziebuhr & Siddell, 2002) . The unusual severity of SARS-CoV infection probably reflects the introduction of an animal coronavirus into a susceptible human population. In the first outbreak at least 8000 people were infected and there were more than 750 fatalities (Donnelly et al., 2003) . and N), non-structural involved in viral RNA synthesis (nsp or replicase) and proteins thought to be non-essential for replication in tissue culture but that clearly provide a selective advantage in vivo (the nspX or accessory proteins; Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . A number of proteins, primarily from the large replicase polyproteins ORF1a and ORF1ab of SARS-CoV, have been targeted by Oxford and Marseille to test the efficacy of a focused structural proteomics approach against a newly emerging human pathogen. Proteins were excluded on the basis of certain criteria, such as size, glycosylation and the presence of transmembrane regions.",

However, the attrition rate from protein purification to structure determination is higher, with only about 30 crystal structures having been determined to date. It appears that this is in part a consequence of the difficulty of growing high-quality crystals. Thus, 34% of soluble proteins crystallized compared with an equivalent rate of 58% for the York/Oxford B. anthracis targets; furthermore, many crystals were not of diffraction quality. However, as for the bacterial targets, patterns of soluble protein expression vary between viral systems. For some groups of viruses, such as the poxviruses, the success rate for production in E. coli was reasonable, as discussed below.",

Target genes were often amplified, cloned and screened for expression in parallel (e.g. 48 or 96 at a time). Ligation-independent cloning strategies were widely (but not exclusively) used and the use of N-and C-terminal His 6 tags was almost universal. The automation of many procedures, including small-scale expression screening, was achieved using liquid-handling robots, with multi-channel pipettes providing an inexpensive option for less automated pipelines (expression-screening strategies are compared by Berrow et al., 2006) . Biophysical characterization methodologies usually included dynamic light scattering (DLS) and mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (see Geerlof et al., 2006) . Protein crystallization on the nanolitre scale was used by many of the partners (Berry et al., 2006) . Here we illustrate the impact of a number of particular SPINE-based technologies on the structure determination of pathogen targets, namely (i) multiple-construct design for a single target, (ii) optimization of protein solubility, (iii) eukaryotic expression systems, (iv) standardized refolding protocols, (v) surface engineering and (vi) other biophysical characterization.",

An example of this in the context of viral proteins is the N-terminal domain of a viral methyltransferase, NS5, of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVE), which was studied in Oxford. The domain boundary was already reasonably well defined from the crystal structure of the related methyl-transferase domain from dengue virus (Egloff et al., 2002) and 18 constructs, comprising of nine pairs of N-and C-terminal His 6 -tagged sequences, were designed that varied the C-terminal end of the protein domain. On the basis of automated small-scale expression screening, six constructs were selected for production. DLS indicated that all protein samples were monodisperse and ESI-MS confirmed the molecular weights for the samples. The His tags were cleaved (using the rhinovirus 3C cleavage site for N-terminal His tags or by carboxypeptidase A treatment to cleave back to a Lys for C-terminal His tags) and these samples entered nanolitre-scale crystallization trials using the standard Oxford set of 672 screens .

To address such problems, Hamburg contributed to the development of an MTB expression system based on the faster growing close relative M. smegmatis (Daugelat et al., 2003) . Proteins were expressed under close to physiological conditions in order to ensure the correct post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and methylation. The published protocol, using an inducible acetamidase promoter, was modified to be compatible with the EMBL pETM vector system (Geerlof et al., unpublished work) . Using this system, the MTB LipB enzyme was expressed with a covalently bound ligand, which resulted in an X-ray structure at 1.08 \u00c5 resolution (Ma et al., 2006) . When expressed in E. coli, a mixture of native and ligand-bound enzyme was produced which failed to crystallize. M. smegmatis expression was also used by the Weizmann for the MTB multidomain eukaryotic like fattyacid synthase I (FASI; Zimhony et al., 2004) after E. coli expression had yielded a soluble but non-functional FASI. A recombinant M. smegmatis strain was constructed by deleting the native fas1 gene and replacing it with the MTB (H37Rv) fas1 gene using a site-specific integrating cosmid carrying the MTB fas1 gene and its 5 0 and 3 0 flanking regions. This produced a faster growing non-pathogenic M. smegmatis (mc2155) derivative expressing MTB FASI.",

In the latter strategy, N-terminal codons were optimized to identify the best silent mutation(s) for maximum expression (Betton et al., 2004) . Such cell-free systems provide a fast standardized method for screening potentially toxic protein expression without the inherent risks of using live cells. Finally, in Stockholm, the MTB NirA protein could only be obtained in a soluble form in E. coli following cloning and co-expression with the cysG gene from Salmonella typhimurium, a gene that codes for an enzyme catalysing three steps in the biosynthesis of sirohaem, a cofactor of NirA.",

Although screening for expression in such systems is at an early stage of development, the technology offers a viable alternative to bacterial expression for 'high-value' targets, as mentioned above for the EBV work. An example from Oxford is the work on the capping enzyme of bluetongue virus VP4, which, owing to problems of toxicity in bacteria, was expressed in insect cells. This protein was problematic during both purification and crystallization, requiring the presence of high salt concentrations throughout. In addition, production of SeMet-derivatized protein proved difficult, prompting development of improved protocols for labelling in insect cells (Sutton et al., unpublished work; Aricescu, Assenberg et al., 2006) .",

The crystallization of proteins is dependent on their surface properties and it is well established that flexible side chains (such as lysine residues) on the surface of proteins reduce the likelihood of successful crystallization (see, for example, Rayment, 1997) . A straightforward method for changing the surface properties ('surface engineering') of proteins is the reductive methylation of lysine residues and this has been shown in some cases to yield samples that are more amenable for growth of high-quality crystals (Kobayashi et al., 1999; Kurinov et al., 2000; Schubot & Waugh, 2004) . To test the effectiveness of this method, Oxford developed a simple, cheap and robust protocol and carried out a systematic study of eukaryotic, bacterial and viral targets. Ten proteins which had previously proved refractory to structural analysis were successfully methylated and entered into crystallization trials (Walter et al., 2006, in the press) . To date, this has led to three novel structures contributed to workpackage 9, one being the MVE methyltransferase domain discussed above.",

The ESI-MS spectrum of purified Cj0982 identified a peak with a mass of 125 greater than the mass of the protein alone. Following crystallization and X-ray structure solution, a bound l-cysteine ligand (mass 125) was identified (M\u00fc ller et al., 2005) .

The product of this gene, NirA protein, has been targeted by the Stockholm group. The amino-acid sequence of NirA is homologous to ferredoxin-dependent sulfite reductases and the purified recombinant enzyme demonstrates a characteristic [Fe 4 -S 4 ] absorption spectrum. The structure of the enzyme was determined using X-ray crystallography ( Fig. 2 ; Schnell et al., 2005) . For this and other difficult projects (including many MTB proteins), it was necessary to employ a hand-crafted approach, exemplified by the requirement to use streak-seeding to improve crystals and by the requirement for co-expression noted above (x3.2). At the active site, the side chains of Tyr69 and Cys161, located in close proximity to the sirohaem cofactor, form an unusual covalent bond. Mutagenesis of these residues decreased the catalytic activity of the enzyme, with Y69A and C161S having the most deleterious effect, suggesting that the covalent bond is important but not essential for enzyme activity. These residues are part of a sequence fingerprint which distinguishes ferredoxin-dependent sulfite from nitrite reductases. This is the first three-dimensional structure obtained of a ferredoxin-dependent sulfite/nitrite reductase.",

            "text": "The Florence group have solved 20 novel structures of copper-binding proteins by NMR. The copper homeostasis systems they have characterized by NMR include the P-type ATPase CopA from B. subtilis (Banci et al., 2002) , a nonpathogenic close relative of B. anthracis that also contains a close CopA orthologue (BA3859). An unusual feature of these P-type ATPases is that the cytoplasmic N-terminus has one or more domains, depending on the complexity of the organism, each containing a metal-binding motif. B. subtilis CopA has two domains (CopAa and CopAb) with similar amino-acid sequences, whereas the copper ATPases of other bacteria have only one domain. NMR analysis revealed one B. subtilis domain (CopAa) to be largely unstructured, suggesting that it may be unfolded in vivo and not functional (Banci et al., 2002) . Sequence comparison of the two domains and orthologous proteins suggested that Ser46 of CopAa may destabilize the hydrophobic core of the domain, as hydrophobic residues (Val and Ala) occur frequently at this position. Indeed, the single mutation S46V of CopAa produced a completely folded domain. The structure of the CopA Nterminal domain was solved by NMR (Fig. 2 ) and the interaction with its copper chaperone partner CopZ (from the same operon) was also characterized (Banci et al., 2003a,b) . It is hypothesized that in vivo the folded functional domain is favoured over an unfolded state, in a manner analogous to the way that the N-terminus of the Wilson's disease protein interacts with its ATP-binding domain (Banci et al., 2003a) .",

This tailed phage infects Lactococcus lactis, a Gram-positive bacterium used extensively for the manufacture of fermented milk products. Infection of L. lactis by tailed phages leads to serious financial losses. Bacteriophage P2 infects specific L. lactis strains by using a receptor-binding protein (RBP) located at the tip of its non-contractile tail. As with the NirA protein, described above, crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments could only be obtained by seeding. Bacteriophage P2 RBP is a homotrimeric protein, each subunit of which comprises three domains (Fig. 3) : the shoulders (a -sandwich attached to the phage), the neck (an interlaced -prism) and the receptorrecognition head (a seven-stranded -barrel; Spinelli et al., 2006) . The complex of RBP with a neutralizing llama VHH5 domain allowed identification of the area on RBP that attaches to the bacterial receptor , where it is able to bind various saccharides (Tremblay et al., 2006) . The structural similarity between the recognition-head domain of bacteriophage P2 and those of adenoviruses or reoviruses, which invade mammalian cells, suggests that these viruses, despite being evolutionarily distant and having different chemical genomic composition (DNA versus RNA), may have a common ancestral gene.",

The protein comprises a single -barrel with a fold previously unseen in single-domain proteins (Fig. 3) . The topology superficially resembles an OB-fold with a C-terminal extension and is related to both of the two subdomains of the SARS-CoV 3Clike protease (which belongs to the serine protease superfamily). Nsp9 has presumably evolved from a protease. The crystal structure suggests that the protein is dimeric and this was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation and light scattering. Nsp9 binds RNA and appears to interact with nsp8. The SPINE structural and functional analyses indicate that nsp9 may play multiple roles in the replicative cycle of coronaviruses. Its interaction with other proteins may be essential for the formation of the viral replication complex together with its ability to interact with RNA (in the absence of other proteins). The loops presented by the -barrel may principally confer the RNA-binding capacity via non-specific interactions, while the C-terminal -hairpin and helix, which display a greater conservation across coronaviruses, are likely to be involved in dimerization and interaction with other proteins.",

Mutants of VACV deficient in A41L are readily cleared by the immune system and the A41L protein has also been shown to reduce the infiltration of inflammatory cells into infected areas of host immune systems in animal models. Oxford produced and purified A41L using the standard pipeline for expression in E. coli, followed by a generic refolding protocol, as mentioned above. Refolded protein was quality-assessed by MS. Crystal screens and optimizations were performed using the HTP protocols developed in Oxford (Walter et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2003; Walter et al., 2005) . The structure was solved by the MAD technique at the UK beamline BM14 (Grenoble) using SeMet-labelled A41L protein (M. Bahar, unpublished work). A41L is a single-domain protein with a core fold that adopts a distinct -sandwich topology. The -sandwich is defined by two -sheets arranged parallel to each other (Fig. 3) and connected by an array of long loops. VACV A41L is structurally similar to the 35K chemokine-binding protein of the related cowpox virus. Work is under way to identify the chemokines to which the molecule binds, but it is clear from the structure that the interactions are somewhat unusual since the protein does not possess the overwhelmingly negatively charged surface usually associated with chemokine-binding proteins.",

The exception to this was the use for crystal screening of a Cartesian robot dispensing nanolitre drops, which had a significant impact on the project (Berry et al., 2006) and led to the determination of the structures of four proteins. Of these, EBV dUTPase is of particular interest. dUTPases are ubiquitous enzymes hydrolyzing dUTP in order to maintain a low intracellular concentration of dUTP and to minimize its incorporation in DNA. Monomeric dUTPases only occur in herpesviruses, whereas other organisms encode related trimeric or unrelated dimeric forms of this enzyme. For trimeric dUTPases, the three different subunits contribute five conserved motifs to each of the three active sites located at the subunit interfaces. The structure of EBV dUTPase represents the first example of a monomeric dUTPase (Tarbouriech et al., 2005) . The structure was determined in complex with the reaction product dUMP and the substrate analogue ,-imino-dUTP. EBV dUTPase (256 residues) consists of two domains, each structurally similar to the subunit of the trimeric dUTPases, which contribute motif III, and motifs I, II and IV, respectively, to the creation of a single active site (Fig. 3) . The C-terminal motif V is largely disordered in the solved structures but is tethered near the active site by an unexpected disulfide bridge between Cys4 and Cys246. The enzyme is a rare example of an evolution from a multimeric to a monomeric protein. Presumably, a single gene-duplication event led to a molecule which maintained an active site extremely similar in structure to those of the trimeric enzymes. It is to be hoped that such subtle differences between the active sites of the viral and the human enzymes can be exploited in the design of specific inhibitors.",

Since SPINE is driven by the notion of selecting 'high-value human health targets', it was natural that a number of human pathogens were targeted for analysis, from bacteria and viruses that cause 'established' human diseases to newly emerging threats to human health (SARS-CoV). Overall, SPINE has solved a substantial number of structures from these targets (over 220, including 65 complexes), some of which are being evaluated as possible new drug targets. However, we have found no generic solution to the traditional problem of protein solubility; rather, the problem has been significantly ameliorated by the sheer numbers of potential constructs that can be screened through the establishment and development of parallel cloning and expression technologies both in bacterial and eukaryotic expression systems. For the future it seems that more comprehensive library-based approaches (sometimes termed 'directed evolution') may have a substantial impact in providing a much more extensive screening for soluble constructs and one such approach, the ESPRIT method (see Alzari et al., 2006) , is being applied to several viral targets of high value, including a SARS-CoV protein, in part as a collaboration between Oxford and Grenoble (C.

The failure to overexpress significant amounts of soluble protein could easily have been put down to the challenging nature of human and human viral targets if only these problems had been used to test pipelines. The work on bacterial targets pinpointed the problems and provided a convenient and reliable benchmark for their resolution. In addition, the B. anthracis project has led to the determination of 45 structures to date, which demonstrates the high success rate which can be achieved with the refined pipelines (up to 30%).
