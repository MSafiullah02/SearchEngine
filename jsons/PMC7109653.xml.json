However, current treatments for recurrent pre-malignant disease can also be problematic. For example, conventional treatment for vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) usually involves repeated local excision or laser ablation. Such treatments are painful and mutilating, and particularly distressing for young women (4). Thus, there is interest in exploring therapeutic vaccines for HPV-associated pre-malignant diseases. Such an approach may be more effective in pre-malignant disease because these patients would not have the immunosuppression observed in advanced cancer patients (5). Furthermore, lower grade lesions may be more genetically stable and thus less prone to down-regulation of immunologically important molecules such as MHC (6).",

Previously, we used HLA:peptide multimers to detect low-frequency HPV16 E6 or E7 specific CTL in the peripheral blood of patients with pre-malignant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) (7) and cancer (8). However, there are a paucity of confirmed human CTL epitopes for HPV, and the majority of these are based on HLA-A*0201 (9). We wished to measure systemic CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in a cohort of patients with HPV-associated pre-malignant disease who had been vaccinated with a live recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine (HPV16 and 18, TA-HPV). Therefore, an assay was developed that involved a short in vitro stimulation of PBMC with pools of HPV16- and HPV18-derived peptides, before measurement of IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells in enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. This method allowed reliable measurement of T cell responses against HPV peptides in both healthy volunteers and patients with pre-malignant HPV-associated disease [lower genital tract neoplasia (LGTN)]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method allowed tracking of HPV peptide-specific T cell responses induced by a live recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine (TA-HPV).",

However, the detection systems used were relatively insensitive, not quantitative and could not map the responses to a single protein or peptide. Therefore, a major aim was to develop a more sensitive assay to measure both CD4+ and CD8+ HPV-specific T cell responses for vaccine studies. This was done initially using cryopreserved blood samples from healthy volunteers, as HPV-specific T cell responses have been frequently found in such subjects (24). Pools of 15mer peptides from HPV16 and 18 E6 and E7 were used to stimulate T cells for direct measurement of IFN-\u03b3 release. Such peptide pools have been used successfully to map anti-viral CD8+ (25) and CD4+ T cell epitopes (26,27).

Initial experiments used an ELISPOT protocol based on culturing PBMC with HPV peptides for 4 days to detect HPV-specific CD4+ T cells (24). However, this was not successful (data not shown), so we cultured PBMC for 7 days with HPV16 or 18 peptide pools prior to testing in ELISPOT assays. To control for the functional viability of cryopreserved samples, a PPP containing multiple CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes was also designed for use alongside the HPV pool (Table 1). Using this modified protocol, a cohort of 10 healthy volunteers (HV001\u20130010, Table 2) was tested for T cell immunity against HPV and recall antigen peptides. One donor (HV009) failed to respond to PPP stimulus and so was excluded from the analysis, however, as exemplified by HV003 (Fig. 1A) and HV007 (Fig. 1B). IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells recognizing either HPV16 or 18 peptides could often be detected (Table 2). Overall, significant T cell responses could be seen from 7/9 volunteers. T cell responses could be demonstrated against HPV16 (5/9), HPV18 (3/9) and both HPV16 and HPV18 (3/9) (Table 2).

To test this, PBMC were obtained from donor HV003 who responded against the HPV16 E6 peptide pool (Fig. 1A, Table 2). These freshly isolated PBMC were cultured with the HPV16 E6 pool before testing in ELISPOT assays using six smaller HPV16 E6 pools or individual HPV16 E6 peptides. A dominant response was seen against pool 4 (data not shown), then subsequently mapped to a 15mer peptide epitope from HPV16 E6127\u2013141 (DKKQRFHNIRGRWTG) (Fig. 2A). Since no other overlapping peptide was recognized, it is likely that the 15mer peptide constituted a CD4+ T cell epitope. To confirm this, PBMC were stimulated with the HPV16 E6127\u2013141 peptide, before using MACS to enrich for either CD8+ or CD4+ T cells, prior to ELISPOT assays. The T cell responses against HPV16 E6127\u2013141 correlated with a CD4+ phenotype, as depletion of CD4+ T cells greatly reduced the response compared with PBMC (Fig. 2B). Depletion of CD8+ T cells slightly augmented the response compared with PBMC (Fig. 2A). No HLA typing data were available for the healthy donors precluding further analysis. Nevertheless, these results demonstrated that the protocol used could reliably detect IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells specific for HPV peptides and could define dominant CD4+ T cell epitopes.",

In this paper, we have used a short in vitro culture step followed by peptide re-challenge in the ELISPOT assay to allow quantitation of IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells, both in healthy donors and patients receiving a candidate therapeutic HPV vaccine. This sensitive approach allowed mapping of novel CD4 T cell epitopes and demonstrated the longevity of a vaccine-induced T cell response against a dominant HPV18 E7 epitope.",

ELISPOT is a sensitive technique, but several studies have demonstrated that ready detection of HPV-specific CD4+ T cell requires a 4-day in vitro culture step (14,24,32). However, this protocol was not successful for the cryopreserved patient samples in this study (S. van der Burg, personal communication), and was modified by increasing the culture period to 7 days. Such an approach has also been used to detect low-frequency human T cell responses against melanoma vaccines (29) or malaria antigens (33). There is the risk that in vitro culture may create variability and skew the T cell responses detected, such that the true repertoire of responding T cells is not represented. But these risks must be balanced against the practical advantages of the protocol, which include increased recovery time from the effects of cryopreservation and amplification of low-frequency responses. We found the assay to be reproducible; the strongest T cell response in VAC002 was repeated in four separate experiments. Furthermore, the same HPV peptide-specific responses were detected in healthy volunteers (HV3 and HV7) in experiments carried out by different individuals, 2 years apart (K.L. Smith and K.M. Gallagher, unpublished observations). These arguments support the usefulness of the cultured ELISPOT assay in demonstrating vaccine responses. However, this assay should not be used for direct numerical comparison of HPV-specific T cells between individual patients.",

This point is important because we did not measure T cell responses at sites of disease. The localized effects of HPV infection and transformation are unlikely to lead to induction of strong systemic effector memory T cell responses. Additionally, the vaccine used in this study was based on vaccinia virus, which by virtue of its lytic nature, and rapid clearance by the immune system, is also unlikely to sustain a population of effector memory T cells in the periphery. Nevertheless, we suggest that the assay system described is capable of detecting central memory T cells, arising from natural infection and 3 years after vaccination.",

Given the small sample sizes, mixed sex of the volunteers and the constraints of the assay system, it was not valid to compare responses of the healthy volunteers against patients. Nevertheless, we confirmed previous studies of CD4+ T cell responses against HPV16 in healthy donors (24,34\u201336) and supported the dominance of CD4+ T cell responses against HPV16 E6 (24). More recent experiments of exclusively female volunteers (n = 9, ages 21\u201330 years) have produced similar results (4/9 HPV16 responders, K.M. Gallagher, unpublished observations). It is likely that these responses represent memory T cells against HPV rather than naive T cells activated in vitro. First, because HPV infection is common (11), it is likely that most adults have encountered these viruses during their lifetime. Second, the in vitro culture period is short, whereas generation of naive T cell responses requires either extended in vitro culture and/or the use of dendritic cells (37). Third, in other studies, the T cells responding against HPV in short-term in vitro culture have a memory cell (CD45RO+) phenotype (32,38). Since the majority of individuals are able to clear HPV infection, study of T cell responses in healthy subjects rather than those who have high-grade disease may provide a clearer picture of the T cell responses involved in protection against disease (24). We are currently attempting to map further HPV epitopes using HLA-typed donors, both for use as possible vaccine candidates and to simplify measurement of immunological endpoints. Such epitopes may allow more precise quantitation in the future using HLA class II multimers.",

In each case, the recognition of a single 15mer peptide suggested recognition by CD4+ T cells. Since the 15mer peptides used overlapped by 9 amino acids, it was possible that single peptides of 10 amino acid or longer could be processed and recognized by CD8+ T cells. However, this was considered unlikely, as 15mer peptides were less efficient at induction of IFN-\u03b3 secretion by CD8+ CTL clones compared with 10mer or 9mer peptides (K.L. Smith, unpublished observations). This suggests that there may be sub-optimal stimulation and detection of memory CD8+ T cells. A non-mutually exclusive explanation is that the frequency of HPV-specific CD8+ CTL is extremely low, as we have previously suggested (7).",

HPV45, which is closely related to HPV18, is the third most prevalent type, i.e. 5.9% (39). Thus, targeting immune responses against both HPV18 and HPV45 would have a major impact on cervical cancer. However, there have been relatively few immunological studies of HPV18 relative to HPV16. In this study, 3/9 healthy donors made a response against HPV18 versus 7/9 responses against HPV16. This ratio of responses parallels the relative prevalence of HPV18 (6%) and HPV16 (10%) detected in a recent longitudinal UK study (40). But the frequency of responders is higher than would be expected from the total incidence of HPV16 and 18 infection, raising questions about the specificity of the T cell responses. One possible explanation for these results is that T cell responses against either HPV16 or HPV18 peptides are in part composed of T cells cross-reactive against many other related HPV types including those that cause benign skin lesions. Such HPV cross-reactivity has recently been demonstrated for HPV11 L1-specific T cells (38). Another possibility is that other human pathogens may induce T cells cross-reactive on HPV peptides (41).",

There may be multiple reasons for the lack of clinical response after TA-HPV vaccination. We were unable to demonstrate T cell responses directly ex vivo. This suggests that the systemic T cell responses against HPV induced by TA-HPV were weak, both by comparison with other therapeutic vaccines (43) and relative to other human viruses (44). This may result from two related features of TA-HPV. First, HPV E6 and E7 are small proteins and may be poorly immunogenic to human T cells. This has been suggested by a study demonstrating the paucity of T cell epitopes in several mouse strains (45). Second, the vaccine delivery system (vaccinia) does not allow for persistent expression of these proteins. While this is a desirable safety feature when using HPV oncogenes as antigens, it could lead to the disappearance of effector memory T cells from the periphery upon viral vaccine clearance. For future vaccines for HPV, the use of peptide- or protein-based vaccines that allow safe persistence of antigen may be more effective (46).",

Whether this reflects individual selection for T cell responsiveness at the level of HLA haplotype or peripheral tolerance against the HPV type in the diseased tissue is not known. However, these results do suggest that while incorporation of multiple HPV types into vaccines may be advantageous for prophylaxis (39), this may not be the case for therapy.",

Our clinical results do contrast somewhat with similar clinical trials using the same vaccine, both of which reported one complete response and several partial responses (48,49). While the partial and complete responses are encouraging, the overall patient response rate suggests that vaccines capable of inducing stronger systemic T cell responses are required. The local nature of HPV disease suggests that strong systemic T cell responses may not be effective in isolation. One promising approach is to use topical treatments that encourage homing of vaccine-induced T cells into disease sites (50).",
