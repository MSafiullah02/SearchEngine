Epic Haiku features a \u201cmulti-provider\u201d video visit option whereby multiple providers can simultaneously interface with the patient from distinct and remote locations. There are several ways that residents can be incorporated into these video visits. So far, we have found the most educational and efficient way is as follows:1.The resident and attending both login to Haiku.2.The resident leads the history and physical assessment with the patient.3.The resident briefly discusses the assessment and plan with the attending with the patient still present on the call, depending on patient comfort.4.The attending then confirms the plan and makes necessary changes.\n",
