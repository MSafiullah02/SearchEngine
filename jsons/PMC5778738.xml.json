Acinetobacter baumannii is of particular importance. The organism is widely distributed in nature and survives on moist and dry surfaces [1, 2]. Worldwide, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDR-Ab) has become a significant cause of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) and hospital-acquired colonizations (HAC) resulting in high morbidity and mortality [3] in patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) over the past two decades [4]. Strict adherence to infection control practices and environmental disinfection have been effective in controlling outbreaks [5]. Appropriate strategies and practices must therefore be implemented to prevent the growing transmission of MDR-Ab.",

Although national studies are lacking, the available evidence suggests rapidly falling susceptibility rates to carbapenems (from 49.2% in 2011 to 15.1% in 2013 at 16 selected hospitals) [6], and a predominance of OXA-23 and GES-11 with upstream insertion sequence ISAba1 (90% of isolates in a study from 11 centers) [7]. At the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), HAI and HAC caused by MDR-Ab initially increased in the ICU in 2007 from 2-3 cases to 5-6 per month. These infections were mostly associated with invasive devices such as ventilators, central venous catheters, and urinary catheters. Investigations carried by the Infection Control and Prevention Program (ICPP) identified multiple factors that contributed to the transmission of MDR-Ab. We herein describe our experience at the AUBMC with MDR-Ab over a 7-year period and the infection control measures that were implemented to control the spread of this organism in the ICU.",

All ICU patients were evaluated examining the risk factors attributed to the transmission of MDR-Ab HAI or HAC. The ICU team routinely collected specimens from newly admitted patients for baseline bacteriological studies and all patients were placed under contact isolation. A standardized screening method was adopted, where cultures were obtained from deep tracheal aspirates (DTA), urine, oropharyngeal, axillary, umbilical, perianal, and rectal areas. The ICPP team reviewed the culture results on daily basis to advise on the isolation status of patients through daily surveillance rounds. Patients identified with MDR-Ab were kept on contact isolation. Cultures were repeated on weekly basis until discharge. All MDR-Ab HAI and HAC were periodically discussed with the ICU staff for feedback and interventions. Furthermore, environmental cultures were obtained following the identification of clusters or outbreaks from the direct environment of the patient and from the medical equipment used inside the ICU cubicle. Repeated cleaning and disinfection was performed for all surfaces or equipment identified to be contaminated with MDR-Ab. A nested retrospective case-control study from January 2007 till June 2008 was performed in the ICU and the Respiratory Care Unit (RCU) to analyze patient related risk factors leading to MDR-Ab transmissions. Controls were randomly selected from patients admitted to the ICU and the RCU during the same study period but who did not have a positive screening culture for MDR-Ab. Moreover, cases consisted of patients with one or more cultures growing MDR-Ab (either colonized or infected). For patients with multiple MDR-Ab culture results, only the first positive culture was considered. The data were entered into a database using IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae Statistics version 21.",

In this study, MDR-Ab was defined as an isolate that is resistant to all tested antimicrobial agents except colistin and tigecycline [8]. A culture positive for MDR-Ab was considered to represent colonization when patients showed no evidence of infection. As for the case definition, patients with at least one clinical/surveillance specimen positive for MDR-Ab were defined as cases of transmission of MDR-Ab colonization or infection that was not present on admission. Such patients were considered to have acquired MDR-Ab during their ICU stay. For device-associated infections, the definitions were subject to considerable variation since 2005 based on the updates issued by the CDC and when the reports published by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system were updated and replaced by the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). All infections were classified using the CDC definitions of the corresponding year using laboratory and clinical criteria. Infection control staff collected data on central line-associated primary bloodstream infections (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAP), and urinary catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) in patients admitted to the adult ICU. Corresponding ICU denominator data consisting of patient-days and device-days were also collected by infection control staff for the same calendar month [9, 10].",

Furthermore, underlying comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and malignancy were significant risk factors for developing an Acinetobacter infection.

Subsequently, ICPP proposed new protocols for the process of placing patients on assisted respiratory therapy and issued detailed procedures for cleaning and disinfection of ventilators. Cultures were taken from additional environmental sources including the water, the faucets, and the air conditioning outlets in the rooms and failed to yield any Acinetobacter growth.
