In this Commission, we document the burden of liver diseases in the region and formulate recommendations to tackle it. It was not feasible to cover every country in the Asia-Pacific region in this Commission. Thus, to maximise our scope by including territories at various stages of development, we divided countries according to their Human Development Index (HDI), selecting the top five most populous countries in the medium-to-high HDI category (China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and the top five in the very high HDI category (Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand; table 1\nshows demographics and health and socioeconomic indicators).2 Given its achievements in controlling HBV, we also included Taiwan when discussing HBV-related liver disease. Commissioners were invited from each of the selected countries and were provided with an outline for data collation and literature review. After this information was synthesised, a draft manuscript was circulated to all collaborators for suggestions, comments, and consensus-building. A final manuscript was then circulated for approval.",

In Asia-Pacific, China accounts for a large proportion of the regional burden of viral hepatitis, particularly HBV, with prevalence in 2018 of more than 80 million estimated chronic infections.4 Nevertheless, the country is moving towards elimination of viral hepatitis4 via a universal HBV vaccination programme in infants and mandatory screening of blood products for HBV and HCV,5 and has exceeded WHO's Western Pacific regional target for HBV vaccination and reduction of HBsAg prevalence in children younger than 5 years.4 According to a 2015 systematic review,6 the estimated HBsAg endemicity in mainland China decreased from 14\u00b70% in 1957\u201389 to 5\u00b74% in 1990\u20132013. More recently, a modelling study7 estimated HBsAg prevalence in China to be 6\u00b71%. In national surveys, the prevalence of HBsAg in the general population decreased from 9\u00b78% in 1992 to 7\u00b72% in 2006.8 In people aged 1\u201329 years, the prevalence of HBsAg decreased from 10\u00b71% in 1992 to 5\u00b75% in 2006 and to 2\u00b76% in 2014.9 Nonetheless, there are still an estimated 77\u201397 million people with chronic HBV infection in China, including more than 20\u201330 million with active liver disease,7 of whom 7 million need urgent treatment because of advanced fibrosis or high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.8 The average annual cost per case of HBV-related liver disease in China was estimated at US$4454\u00b70 (direct), $924\u00b73 (indirect), and $6611\u00b710 (intangible).10\n",

According to the GHE 2015 dataset, hepatitis B infection in Indonesia accounted for 37\u00b70% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and for 29\u00b71% of all deaths due to liver cancer, whereas these proportions were 35\u00b78% and 35\u00b72% for hepatitis C (table 2).1 Acute hepatitis B and C infection accounted for 78\u00b71% and 3\u00b71% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in Indonesia in 2015.1 Information about the prevalence of HBV and HCV in the general Indonesian population is unavailable because of inadequate disease surveillance and probable under-reporting, geographical barriers for collecting data on 250 million people living on more than 17 000 islands, and few testing facilities. The prevalence of HBsAg ranged from 4% to 20\u00b73% in 1990\u201397,31 making Indonesia a country with intermediate-to-high endemicity of hepatitis B. HBsAg prevalence during that period ranged between 37% and 76% in patients with liver cirrhosis and was 37\u201368% in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.31 Efforts to collect national-level data were made in 2007 through Indonesia's Basic Health Research survey (known as RISKESDAS) in 21 of 33 provinces. The prevalence of HBsAg in 2007 was 9\u00b74%, that of anti-HBc was 32\u00b78%, and of anti-HBs was 30\u00b76%.32, 33 A nationwide study in 2015 covering 33 provinces showed that the prevalence of HBsAg was 7\u00b71%, that of anti-HBc was 31\u00b79%, and of anti-HBs was 35\u00b76%.34 These data showed a decline in the prevalence of HBsAg (9\u00b74% in 2007 to 7\u00b71% in 2013), suggesting that Indonesia has moved from high endemicity to moderate endemicity of hepatitis B (appendix p 1).",

With 5 000 000 pregnancies per year in Indonesia, approximately 150 000 pregnant mothers could potentially transmit HBV to their babies annually, of whom 95% will develop chronic hepatitis B and be infectious for their entire lives. This transmission incidence is of serious concern, considering that coverage of HBV birth-dose vaccination is low, screening tests for HBV in pregnant women are not routinely done, and antiviral treatment for women infected with HBV has not been adopted as a preventive strategy for mother-to-child transmission.31\n",

Subsequently, introduction of nucleic-acid amplification testing for HCV, HBV, and HIV in blood products by the Japanese Red Cross in 1999, and screening of pregnant women for HBV infection, lead to a decline in hepatocellular carcinoma cases due to viruses transmitted by transfusion.51 The incidence of transfusion-transmitted viral hepatitis in people who had a transfusion in 2007 was reported to be 0\u00b70007%.54\n",

Adolescent catch-up immunisation programmes could have contributed to this decrease in young adults. However, there was an increase in complications related to chronic HBV such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma from 450 cases in 2008 to 1550 in 2017.77 The seroprevalence of HBsAg in Indigenous Australian adults was estimated to be 17% in a meta-analysis of studies done before 2000.78 Since then, HBsAg seroprevalence in Indigenous Australians is estimated to have declined to 3\u00b77% of the 548 366 total population in 2011. This seroprevalence is still more than 10 times that in non-Indigenous Australians born in Australia (0\u00b73% of 13 836 559, excluding people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men).79\n",

However, in 2012, there were an estimated 50 000 (1\u00b75%) people aged 15 years and older with HCV, and approximately 1000 new cases are identified each year.84 It was estimated that only half of the people in this age group are currently diagnosed and only a quarter are aware that they have the disease.84 Approximately 90 000 individuals are living with chronic HBV infection.85 In New Zealand, there was an increase in the incidence of liver cancer, from 145 in 1999 to 253 new registrations in 2009 and high fatality (from 127 to 208 people) in the same period.86 There are four main ethnic groups in New Zealand (European, M\u0101ori, Pacific Islander, and Asian), with smaller proportions identifying with other ethnic groups. Liver cancer is the fourth most common in incidence and mortality in M\u0101ori men. In this group, hepatocellular carcinoma registration and mortality were almost 3\u00b75 times those of non-M\u0101ori men in 2010\u201312,87 which has perhaps declined since a study done in 1983\u201394 that suggested that M\u0101ori people had a 7 times higher risk than non-M\u0101ori people,88 and a further study in 1981\u20132004 that indicated that risk was 4\u00b779 times higher.89\n",

Regular surveys for chronic HBV show a steady decreasing trend in its seroprevalence. More than 90% of children aged up to 12 years have been immunised against hepatitis B. In 2001, a school immunisation programme against hepatitis B was initiated to screen and immunise all children who were not covered under the national programme. Both programmes have been very successful, as there have been no reports of acute childhood hepatitis B infections since 1997.",

Large community-based epidemiology surveillance found that HEV genotype 4 was the dominant type, indicative of zoonotic transmission.122 China has made progress in preventing HAV and HEV transmission through improving food and water hygiene, as well as vaccination against HAV.123 A vaccine against HEV has been approved in mainland China, with short-term and long-term efficacy being reported.124\n",

In these areas, acute HEV infection causes high mortality, especially in pregnant women and in patients with underlying chronic liver diseases. Acute HAV is increasingly leading to severe hepatitis in adults as the quality of sanitation is improving in certain localised areas of these regions, reducing earlier exposure and immunity to infection. In countries with very high HDIs, acute HAV, although rare, is seen predominantly in travellers to endemic areas, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. Conversely, acute HEV infection is predominantly zoonotic and is acquired by eating infected meat or handling pigs.",

Additionally, an increasing trend in the odds ratio of having NAFLD was observed as the number or risk factors increased. A combination of physical inactivity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, large waist circumference, high BMI, high HbA1c, high triglycerides, low HDL, high LDL, and high alanine aminotransferase predicted the highest odds of 10\u00b78 for NAFLD (95% CI 4\u00b79\u201324; p=0\u00b7001).217 In a large community-based study of 1225 individuals, NAFLD was found in 741 (60\u00b75%); this proportion was higher in those with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.217 Considering the increasing burden of type 2 diabetes and other non-communicable diseases, NAFLD is emerging as a major threat for the health-care system in Pakistan.",

NAFLD and other causes accounted for 8\u00b73% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases in the GHE 2015 dataset, and for 5\u00b77% of all deaths due to liver cancer (table 2).1 There are no formal studies of prevalence of fatty liver disease in Singapore but at a 2012 public health forum, 40% of 227 attendees were diagnosed with a fatty liver.236 In a study of fatty liver disease in patients undergoing cholecystectomy, the prevalence increased over time in a 10-year period, from 40% to 56\u00b76%.237 In the Singapore Chinese Health Study,238 a large prospective cohort study, 63 257 patients were followed up since 1993\u201398 for an average of 14 years; of them, 499 developed hepatocellular carcinoma. People with diabetes in this study had a hazard ratio of 2\u00b714 (95% CI 1\u00b769\u20132\u00b771) of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. This effect was independent of markers for viral hepatitis. In the study, a history of diabetes was present in 8\u00b79% of the population at baseline.238 Data from the Singapore Ministry of Health showed that 11\u00b73% of Singaporeans had diabetes in 2010, representing an increase from 8\u00b72% in 2004.239 Since diabetes is a major risk factor for fatty liver disease and NASH other than obesity, this increase provides some insight into the potential increase in burden of NAFLD. The Ministry of Health also found that there was an increasing trend of obesity from 6\u00b79% in 2004 to 10\u00b78% in 2010 and 8\u00b76% in 2013.93 The general lifestyle of Singaporeans involves low physical activity and high-calorie diets, both of which increase the risk of obesity and diabetes, and thus the risk of NAFLD.",

With large-scale procurement, the current cost of a 12-week HCV treatment regimen of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir is $70 and is expected to decrease (Sarin S K, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India, personal communication). This is one of the most comprehensive hepatitis control programmes globally, on the basis that it incorporates the sequelae of hepatitis infection together with hepatitis infection itself, and intends to reach out to primary health centres in a phased manner. It also features surveillance for acute hepatitis, including hepatitis A and E. Some ongoing related programmes are hepatitis B immunisation for infants, safe blood transfusion, policies on injection safety, safe disposal of biomedical waste, food safety, and, most recently, treatment of hepatitis C. India does not currently have a national alcohol policy, but it has several policies and interventions aimed at reducing the harmful effects of alcohol (table 4). The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment also has reduction and prevention policies on alcohol and drugs. Alcohol is a subject in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, which defines the exclusive legislative powers of state governments. Therefore, the laws governing alcohol, such as the legal drinking age in India and the laws that regulate its sale and consumption, vary from state to state. In India, consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the states of Bihar Gujarat, and Nagaland, as well as the union territory of Lakshadweep. There is a partial ban on alcohol in some districts of Manipur. All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption but have various legal drinking ages. In some states, the legal drinking age can be different for different types of alcoholic beverages.",

            "text": "Current policies in India largely do not focus directly on overweight, obesity, and NAFLD (table 5). However, in the context of ameliorating the burden of non-communicable diseases, certain government initiatives have been undertaken. The GBD statistics253 and the projected prevalence of death and disability due to non-communicable diseases (obesity being the major risk factor) led the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to reduce the overweight diagnostic threshold for BMI to 23 kg/m2 (from 25), and the standard waist circumference indicative of abdominal obesity to 90 cm in men and 80 cm in women (internationally accepted waist circumference thresholds for abdominal obesity are 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women). These standards have been published in the ministry's Consensus Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome, which were released jointly with the Diabetes Foundation of India, the All-India Institute of Medical Science, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the National Institute of Nutrition, and 20 other health organisations.254 Considering the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases and the risk factors common among the major non-communicable chronic conditions, the Government of India initiated the integrated National Programme for Prevention and Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Stroke.255 The programme focuses on health promotion and prevention, strengthening infrastructure and human resources, early diagnosis and management, and integration with the primary health-care system through non-communicable-disease cells at different levels for optimal operational synergies.255 Consumption of junk food has also increased rampantly in India over the past two decades, and the industry primarily targets children. Although the Indian Government has not yet established a policy to ban junk food in schools and their close perimeters, the state governments of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have instructed schools not to allow the sale of junk food in their canteens. In India, no specific laws or guidelines regulate the advertising or marketing of junk foods, but provisions under laws in other policy areas and some guidelines issued by the self-governing Advertising Standards Council of India could be used to regulate their advertising. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has also produced the Guidelines\u2013Code of Self-Regulation in Food Advertisement to control the objectivity and accuracy of food advertisements.256 However, all of these measures are recommendations rather than mandatory.257 Amendments regarding packaging and labelling of food under part VII of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules of 1955 mandate the disclosure of health claims alongside nutritional labeling.258 However, stricter policies are required to prevent misleading information. For example, most packaged junk food in India does not mention trans fat because that is not required by the law. In 2010, the FSSAI expert group formulated guidelines that recommend less than 10% trans fats in food products.259\n",

In 2009, to monitor the effectiveness of the Programme's activities and guide the implementation of evidence-based preventative interventions, the Pakistan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (under the akistani Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Health) launched a hepatitis sentinel-site surveillance system (appendix p 3). The sites were located in five public tertiary care hospitals in four provincial headquarters (Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi, and Quetta) and in Islamabad. To engage Sindh province to implement strategies, the United States Agency for International Development further supported the Pakistani Centres for Disease Control and Prevention toward expansion of the surveillance sites.273, 274 A National Hepatitis Strategic Framework for viral hepatitis (2017\u201321)274, 275 has been launched to eliminate viral hepatitis C by 2030, reduce hepatitis B and C by 10% reduction by 2021, and reduce new cases of hepatitis B, C, and D by 30% by 2021. So far, the measures implemented by the Government of Pakistan include HBV vaccination for children and adults and providing antiviral therapy for patients with HBV and HCV through various programmes and public awareness campaigns. The national essential medicines list, subsidised by the government, includes antiviral therapy for HBV (interferon alpha, pegylated interferon, entecavir, tenofovir, and lamuvidine) and HCV (interferon alpha, pegylated interferon, ribavirin, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, and velpatsavir).",

In a 5-year retrospective cohort study between 2008 and 2013 that estimated HCV in blood donors from their medical records, the incidence of HCV infection was 0\u00b740 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 0\u00b727\u20130\u00b757) on the basis of viral RNA seroconversion.295 Incidence was as low as that reported between 1994 and 2004 (1\u00b79 per 100 000 person-years, 95% CI 1\u00b71\u20133\u00b70).296 Additionally, the incidence of HCV infection is very low, and HCV is nearly eradicated. As discussed, deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma plateaued in 2002\u201304 and have declined since. Access to medical examinations is easy, so patients with high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma can be regularly monitored and many cases are treatable because they are detected at an early stage. The production and off-premise sale of all alcoholic beverages based on the Liquor Tax Law requires a Government licence (table 4). This licensing system has been strictly imposed over time and almost no home-brewed alcohol has been available on the market for the past 30 years. However, there is virtually no restriction on off-premise sales in Japan and there are no restrictions on the advertising alcoholic beverages.",

Lunches tend to be planned by a nutritionist, include locally grown and fresh ingredients, and tend to be dominated by rice, vegetables, soups, and fish. Childhood obesity has increased in Japan since the 1970s, but that increase has happened more slowly than in other economically developed countries. The Government has established healthy waistline thresholds for adults aged 40\u201374 years with the metabo law, which came into effect in 2008, and these are measured at annual checkups.298 The threshold for men is 33\u00b75 inches or less and women, it is 35\u00b74 inches. People who exceed those norms are required to attend counselling and support sessions. Companies are required to measure the waistlines of at least 80% of their employees along with their families, and of retired employees. Furthermore, at the time of introduction, companies were required to help 10% of those who were above the thresholds to lose weight by 2012, and 25% by 2015. Companies and local governments that failed to meet specific targets were liable for financial penalties, potentially as high as $19 million.298 The targets have not been updated, but companies are now required to increase their contributions to their welfare fund by 10% if they do not perform well. Men and women who exceed the waistline measurement threshold during their annual medical examinations are enrolled in diet programmes, fitness classes, or are asked to see a doctor. The long-term effectiveness of this controversial stringent approach are yet to be clarified.299\n",

Furthermore, the introduction of highly effective HBV antiviral therapy in Australia with entecavir in 2005 and tenofovir in 2007 was accompanied by considerable increases in treatment uptake.

The national health-care plan covers the entire population and ensures that all Singaporeans have access to medical care. Although public hospitals provide 80% of expensive tertiary care services, private sector practitioners account for 80% of primary health care, with government polyclinics that operate under the Ministry of Health accounting for the other 20%.334\n",

Chronic hepatitis B is the most common cause of liver diseases and is primarily addressed the National Childhood Immunisation Programme implemented in 1987. Infant vaccination is given at birth followed by the second dose at 1 month of age and the third dose 6 months later. Hepatitis B serology is routinely tested as part of antenatal assessments. For surveillance, only acute hepatitis B and C are notifiable diseases to the Ministry of Health. Singapore's hepatitis B guidelines, which include chronic hepatitis B management, were introduced by the Ministry of Health in 2011.93 The Government also setup a Medication Assistance Fund to help eligible patients to pay for expensive drugs that are not in Singapore's standard drug list but have been assessed to be clinically cost-effective. Patients receive drug subsidies and assistance on the basis of their subsidy and means-test status and the scheme under which the drug is covered (ie, standard drug list vs Medication Assistance Fund). For patients with chronic hepatitis B, adefovir and lamivudine are the only drugs listed under the standard drug list. Entecavir and tenofovir are listed under the Medication Assistance Fund. Drug subsidies are provided for patients with HCV, including for pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and sofosbufir\u2013velpatasvir.335 MediSave's list of chronic diseases for which patients can make claims does not include liver diseases. For MediShield Life, claims cover mainly expensive hospital procedures and inpatient treatment for liver disease.

Only babies born to HBsAg-positive mothers were vaccinated because of high costs but, as of 1986, all infants weighing 2500 g or more were eligible. In the late 1980s, the programme was extended to preschool children, medical personnel, and elementary-school children, and from 1992 onward, unvaccinated teenagers and adults have been encouraged to be vaccinated on a fee-for-service basis. Around 2000, because of the availability of effective treatments for hepatitis B and C, treatment of chronic viral hepatitis was added to the programme. In 2003, treatment for chronic hepatitis B and C was reimbursed by the national health insurance, which has had a tremendous impact on the outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis. A 2010 analysis showed a steady and substantial decrease of the mortality of patients with end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan.348 In 2017, some of the direct-acting antivirals against HCV infection were covered by the national health insurance for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C.",

The health-care delivery system, therefore, relies hugely on private organisations that have advanced facilities but are unaffordable to most people. Public health-care institutions that provide advanced care are often only located in major towns and cities and private tertiary care hospitals are extremely expensive. Poor people in rural areas tend to consult local private doctors, with 70% of the population served by the private sector.355 The private sector operates through a fee-for-service system of hospitals, general practitioners, and homeopathic and traditional healers. Very few mechanisms exist to regulate the quality, standards, protocols, ethics, or prices in the private health sector. Additionally, opportunities for health-related research are few, and not many advanced technologies, such as molecular diagnostics and advanced endoscopic techniques, have been introduced in public-sector institutions in Pakistan.

However, no other transplantations were done until 2011 when a single liver transplantation from a deceased donor was done in Lahore. From 2012 onward, several medical centres in Pakistan have attempted to develop programmes for transplantation from living donors.357 The most important impeding factor in developing high-volume transplantation programmes across Pakistan is the lack of skilled workforce. Shifa International Hospital (Islamabad) and the Shaikh Zayed Center of Liver Transplantation (Lahore) are the only two transplantation centres run by local teams, whereas others rely exclusively on international collaborators. Security concerns and visa delays make frequent travel by international teams difficult, and the reliance on international experts interrupts continuity of care. Thus, the presence of efficient local transplant teams is crucial to develop successful and sustainable transplantation programmes. Until February, 2017, only 539 liver transplantations had been done in Pakistan, and approximately 95% of these were done in the two locally run centres. A liver transplant from a living donor in Pakistan costs $35 000\u201345 000. Most patients are self-funded, and financial restrictions are one of the biggest hurdles to accessibility. The Human Organ and Transplantation Authority regulates legal and ethical aspects of liver transplantation in Pakistan, but its decentralisation with the 18th amendment of Pakistan's Constitution has moved various ministries, including the Ministry of Health, from central to provincial control.358 Those changes have given rise to five autonomous provincial bodies that regulate transplant activity, allowing for a stringent legal and regulatory process at the provincial level. Simultaneously, the current decentralised approach challenges the implementation of a future national transplant registry that might monitor transplantation activity and outcomes countrywide. The Government will have to consider innovative ideas including private\u2013public sector partnerships and proper incentivisation of skilled medical personnel to make liver transplantation available in poor settings in Pakistan. The implementation of a national transplant registry is inevitable to ensure transparency in various steps of organ donation and outcome reporting while providing transplant services of international credibility.",

In 2016, 1417 liver transplantations were done. Of those, 963 cases were from living donors.364 Since June, 2016, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease system has been used to match deceased liver donors to compatible patients, instead of the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. 1-year graft survival in 1998 was 62% for patients with liver transplants from deceased donors and 80% for those with living donors. Survival outcomes had improved substantially by 2009, showing 1-year graft survival of 76% for patients with transplants from deceased donors and 90% for those with transplants from living donors, primarily because of developments in quality control and immunosuppression. In South Korea, liver transplantation from living donors is thought to be effective and feasible for patients needing a transplant. Transplantation from living donors has substantially increased over the past three decades because livers from deceased donors are scarce. Better understanding of the regeneration of partial grafts and various advances in surgical techniques have contributed to a marked improvement in patient and donor outcomes in cases of living-donor transplantation.",

Implementation began in 1988 and applied only to kidney donation. A 2004 amendment to the Act also permitted living organ donation and included other organs, such as livers, hearts, and corneas. The 2004 amendment further included all causes of death rather than solely death by accidental causes. Further legislative amendments in 2007 and 2009 were made with the firm intent of expanding the supply of transplantable organs and ensuring that organ donors are not exploited, unlawfully induced, or forced into organ retrieval by non-government actors.377 Another scheme is the Medical Therapy, Education, and Research,378 which operates on an opt-in basis, allowing people to pledge their organs or body parts for transplantation, education, or research after death. Additionally, the Ministry of Health subsidises at least 50% of the cost of liver transplantations.

With the vast expansion of coverage between 2004 and 2007, reimbursement is falling as medical expenditure is increasing. In 2007, the real reimbursement rate (reimbursement amount divided by total expenditure on medical care) was around 19% for illnesses that required expenditures between \u00a5200 and \u00a52000, but only 8% if expenditure was more than \u00a510 000.384 The distribution of health workers is also uneven between rural and urban areas of China, with two-thirds of the health-care workforce situated in urban areas.

The hepatitis A vaccination strategy in susceptible high-income population groups would need to be reassessed. Introducing a hepatitis A vaccine in resource-poor populations is problematic because the resulting reduction in HAV transmission can have unintended consequences. Although it might reduce the risk of HAV infection, it also has the potential to increase the average age at which HAV infection occurs,401 thereby increasing the overall risk of acute disease. Thus, introducing vaccination with low coverage in a high-endemicity area would change the epidemiology to an intermediate-endemicity pattern, which is undesirable. By contrast, high-coverage vaccination in an intermediate-endemicity area would result in the desirable outcome of low endemicity.",

Studies are needed to develop cheap, accessible, point-of-care testing for HBV and HCV, and on preventive measures and new drug treatments for NAFLD. Research to improve coverage of HBV vaccination for high-risk groups, particularly preventing HBV transmission from mother to baby, is needed. Strategies should be developed to improve general awareness about liver disease among the public and medical staff and training of existing health-care workers on managing liver diseases.",

Japan has a budget of $400 billion per year for overall health-care expenditure, accounting for 38\u00b78% of the national governmental budget. Research must focus on the pathogenesis and treatment of NASH, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and liver fibrosis, and on effective ways of delivering health-care education and information on prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Effective models of community-based care for patients with liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, need to be investigated.

Additionally, although antiviral therapy has been well supported by the national insurance reimbursement policy, there is still a gap between the HBV management guidelines proposed by KASL and government policy. Although screening tests for HBV infection are done for women who are preparing for pregnancy, army recruits, adults aged 40 years and older, and groups at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, a continuous management programme after HBV diagnosis requires further consideration, and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of screening adults older than 40 years must be re-evaluated.",

In many cases, doctors give patients who visit hospital general lifestyle modification recommendations, rather than specific guidelines.

HBV vaccination programmes for infants have been implemented by all countries. The administration of a birth dose of the HBV vaccine is still inadequate in many countries, especially in low-income and rural settings. Implementing policies on mandatory screening of blood and blood products for HBV and HCV and safe injection practices is still a challenge in many countries (eg, India and Pakistan). We strongly recommend a focus on harm reduction strategies that target people who inject drugs in all countries of the Asia-Pacific where these practices are prevalent. There has been progress in improving access to generic medications and reducing costs. The governments of many countries have put HBV and HCV drugs on their lists of essential medicines. There is an urgent need to make generic drugs available in all countries of the region and bring the costs of hepatitis C drugs to less than a dollar a day, following India's example.",

A greater focus is now needed on prequalification (ie, evaluating diagnostic tests with standardised protocols for their quality, performance, and safety to guide procurement decisions by actors such as WHO Member States or UN agencies) to ensure provision of high-quality diagnostics and clinical evidence for simplified management algorithms in settings where diagnostics are not available.4 We believe that governments should widely engage with all stakeholders, including individuals and organisations representing at-risk groups (eg, people who inject drugs, prisoners, and individuals with HIV), and also be liberal in approving and implementing new diagnostic devices.",

There are several areas that organisations can prioritise to support viral hepatitis elimination efforts. Some are specific to viral hepatitis, for example the need to support the scale-up of birth-dose vaccination, which should be included in the remit of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for support. Several other areas can leverage existing mechanisms that support other disease responses, notably HIV, to improve access to care and treatment for patients with viral hepatitis.4 We believe that governments should be increasingly accountable and take timely measures toward national viral hepatitis elimination strategies. Adequate enforcement of policies is also needed. Funding bodies should ask for evidence of the outcomes of their investments to improve accountability. Data on progress of achieving elimination targets should be regularly reported by WHO and other funders but more attention needs to be paid to each country's performance relative to others. Countries need to develop new fiscal spaces to accelerate the elimination of viral hepatitis, which will require innovative means of financing.4 Sponsoring the scale-up of blood testing is a key challenge and sustaining progress will require not only financing but also strong political will and unrelenting advocacy.",

The Asia-Pacific region experiences a greater challenge from HBV and HCV infection than any other global region, having half of the 20 most heavily burdened countries.427 Countries in the Asia-Pacific with a high burden of viral hepatitis span the economic spectrum and there is a negative correlation between GNI and the prevalence of both HBV and HCV, with a greater burden in low-income countries.4 Countries need to define target screening populations, improve awareness among health-care workers regarding treatment options, subsidise the costs of drugs, and enhance access to them. Emulating Egypt and Georgia in managing HCV could be useful for countries in the Asia-Pacific region.428, 429 Infant HBV vaccination programmes have been implemented by all countries but often fall short of administering birth doses; Taiwan can be a positive example for HBV vaccination. Although policies on mandatory screening of blood and blood products for HBV and HCV are in place in all countries in the Asia-Pacific region (although nucleic-acid amplification testing is not mandatory in all), as are policies on safe injection practices, the lack of strong political commitment and effective regulations in low-to-middle income countries, especially in southeast Asia, limits the outcomes. Reuse of contaminated needles continues to cause outbreaks of hepatitis B and C in southeast Asia.46, 398 Harm reduction strategies targeting people who inject drugs need to be implemented, as has been done in Malaysia using the \u201cSupport.

Various targets have been proposed to achieve this, including three-dose coverage of hepatitis B vaccination in infancy (90%), receiving a timely birth dose (90%), blood safety (100%), injection safety (unsafe injections target of 0%), harm reduction (target for syringe and needle per person who injects drugs per year of 300), awareness of status of people infected with HBV and HCV (90%), and awareness of the status of infected people who were on HBV treatment or had started HCV treatment (80%).

We recommend that countries should develop their own capacities and set up national monitoring systems to complement national surveys and provide crucial information that allows them to evaluate alcohol policies and track alcohol consumption trends over time.

Local, national, and international monitoring and surveillance frameworks are needed to track the magnitude and trends of alcohol consumption and related harm, as well as monitor policy responses and analyse trends in alcohol consumption and its related disease burden. Such frameworks would be crucial to strengthen advocacy, adjust policy, and programme responses to the trends in alcohol-related harms and assess the effect of interventions.

The high frequency of metabolic comorbidities in patients with NAFLD indicates that management of the increasing number of these patients might increase the strain on health systems. Furthermore, many patients with NAFLD develop progressive liver disease, which creates challenges for screening.240\nPanel 2Priority areas of action for liver diseases related to NAFLD in the

Actions and interventions against NAFLD need to be urgently incorporated into WHO's Global Action Plan on non-communicable diseases,435 including public awareness (under Objective 1 of the Plan); screening for NAFLD; using simple, non-invasive biochemical markers to detect fibrosis in patients with NAFLD; early detection and weight management strategies including lifestyle modifications (dietary and physical activity); and interventions to prevent progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Effective prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (including NAFLD) require leadership, coordinated multistakeholder engagement, and multisectoral action for health, both at the government level and at actor level. Such efforts would include health-in-all-policies and whole-of-government approaches across sectors such as health, agriculture, communication, education, employment, energy, environment, finance, food, foreign affairs, housing, justice and security, legislature, social welfare, social and economic development, sports, tax and revenue, trade and industry, transport, urban planning, and youth affairs, and partnership with relevant civil society and private sector entities. Opportunities to prevent and control NAFLD and its risk factors occur at multiple stages of life and interventions in early life often offer the best chance for primary prevention. People and communities should be empowered and involved in activities for prevention and control, including advocacy, policy, planning, legislation, service provision, education and training, monitoring, and research and evaluation of the effects of measures for the control and prevention of NAFLD.

SDG 3.9b calls for the provision of access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health,436 which affirms the right of developing countries to fully use the provisions of the TRIPS agreement to provide access to medicines for all by 2030. To this end, health-financing systems should not only seek to raise sufficient funds for health provision but should also do so in a way that allows people to use services without risk of severe financial hardship or impoverishment.437 Three interrelated areas could bring health financing closer to universal health coverage: raising funds for health, reducing financial barriers to health-care access through prepayment and subsequent pooling of funds instead of direct out-of-pocket payments, and allocating or using funds in a way that promotes efficiency and equity. Public health systems and public\u2013private partnerships need to be strengthened to face the challenges that an increasing burden of liver diseases could create, and measuring progress is an inherent part of any prevention and treatment strategy. We suggest a set of metrics to monitor the implementation of the various aspects of such a strategy (table 6\n).",

The fiscal space depends on the sources of finance available from improved economic growth that creates favourable macroeconomic conditions, such as revenues generated from new taxation or strengthened tax administration, borrowing from domestic and international sources, reprioritisation of health within the existing government budget, more effective and efficient allocation of available health resources, and innovative domestic and international financing.438\n",

These innovative financing mechanisms link different elements of the financing value chain to mobilise funding from multiple sources (eg, governments, foundations, and the private sector), pool finances, and channel and allocate funds to health programmes through organisations and governments in low-income and middle-income countries. Outsourcing of services, such as diagnostic tests or management systems for health-care data, to non-government providers and encouraging the use of advanced market commitments (eg, vaccine purchases) can also be used to secure investment in health-care services from the private sector.439 The opportunity to link revenue generation to a global redistributive and environmental agenda should be sought via taxes on carbon, luxury items, or capital flow, and leveraging an increased domestic return on the natural resources and primary commodities of poor countries.440 Other financing mechanisms including global health bonds, debt-conversion instruments, market commitment instruments, social and development impact bonds, and global solidarity taxes and levies need to be invoked.

Similarly, obesity and NAFLD-related liver diseases are common in all countries, irrespective of HDI, and are also expected to increase.
