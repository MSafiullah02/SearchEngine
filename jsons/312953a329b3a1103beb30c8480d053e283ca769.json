Well-validated and functional machine learning methods and heuristic property calculators would be especially desirable, as are Monte Carlo models of infectious disease spread and prediction of the impact of different NPI strategies. Custom code will be made rapidly available in appropriate repositories (e.g., GitHub). \u2022 We commit to applying thoughtful permissive (and open source) licensing strategies (such as those recommended by Reproducible Research Standard) 5 to ensure that our models and data can be maximally reused, modified, and redistributed to rapidly advance the field in developing new therapies, while appropriately recognizing and acknowledging original authors and contributors.",

Furthermore, MolSSI in collaboration with BioExcel 16 is setting up a centralized github and file sharing service to provide a centralized site for community data and is also working with Zenodo 17 and the Open Science Grid 18 to help store data and data analysis outcomes for this global initiative. Data storage and high performance computation can also be linked and integrated (e.g., with biomedical data) by e-infrastructures such as Fenix/ ICEI 19 developed for the Human Brain Project.",
