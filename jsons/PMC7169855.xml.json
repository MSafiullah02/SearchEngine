This latter time\u2010related risk is higher for recipients whose transfusion exposure spans a longer time interval.1, 4 Factors relevant to clinical outcome of a transfusion\u2010transmitted infection include the expected length of recipient survival due to underlying disease and the increased susceptibility of different patient populations (based on their degree of immunosuppression) to adverse clinical outcomes secondary to infectious disease transmission.5 Thus, a logical way to categorize RBC recipients is both by number of units transfused and by the time interval over which transfusions occur.

A smaller single\u2010hospital study using a retrospective noncontemporaneous study design demonstrated a decreased alloimmunization rate in recipients of LR versus non\u2010LR RBCs based on comparing data from two 1\u2010year intervals separated by 14 years.93 This same study showed that LR resulted in a decreased alloimmunization rate in acute myeloid leukemia patients whereas a different study showed no effect of LR in MDS patients.90 Other smaller studies in thalassemia patients have suggested an association of LR with a decreased RBC alloimmunization rate;94 however, these studies have had small sample sizes and have potential confounding factors. In summary, the available data do not allow for a firm conclusion. Unlike LR (which still leaves a small number of viable WBCs in the blood product),80, 81 PI renders WBCs nonviable and stops protein production and antigen expression, thus establishing a theoretical basis for why PI might reduce alloimmunization even if LR does not.95, 96\n",

These risks change when an EIA enters the blood supply. The figure indicates two types of EIAs: an acute agent and a chronic agent.* A past example of an acute EIA is West Nile virus and a past example of a chronic EIA is HIV. In contrast to known agents, EIA risks will vary over time. The intervals between an acute or chronic EIA entering the blood supply and the application of a successful intervention for that agent have been estimated as 1.5 and 5 years, respectively. After recognition of the EIA and development of a screening test, the risk from that agent will be decreased but a small residual risk will remain, thereby slightly increasing the overall per\u2010unit risk above the previous level. This is indicated (though not to scale) by the stepwise increase in the horizontal line. *An acute agent is present only transiently (usually days to weeks) until the donor resolves the viremia or parasitemia. In contrast, the donor retains the chronic agent in their blood for many years (perhaps an entire lifetime) while remaining asymptomatic and capable of blood donation.",
