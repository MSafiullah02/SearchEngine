When applied to living tissue (e.g., the skin), they are termed antiseptics. When applied to inanimate objects (e.g., environmental surfaces or instruments used to perform medical procedures), they are termed disinfectants. All of these agents work at least by damaging microbial surfaces, often by alkylation, oxidation, or reaction with proteins. Products capable of destroying all forms of microbial life, including bacterial spores, are termed sterilizing agents.",

An important disadvantage is flammability; this happens only when the prep solution that is applied does not evaporate fully and when electrocautery is also employed.
