As an academic medical center located in New York, one of the first cities in the United States to be impacted by COVID-19, the Children's Hospital at Montefiore redeployed faculty to care for adult COVID-19 patients, reorganized pediatric space to accommodate an increased pediatric and adult census, while serving as the only major pediatric inpatient service open in the Bronx. In parallel with these rapid changes, our Department of Pediatrics' leadership also developed an approach to monitor and mitigate negative effects on faculty well-being.",

Likewise, faculty may respond to the stress by trying to \"power through\" without acknowledging the emotional impact of the crisis. Physicians often struggle 3 with asking for help for themselves under typical circumstances; however, the intensity of the COVID-19 crisis heightens this issue. 7 Faculty may be accustomed to working in teams and experiencing a sense of community.",

The support calls, themselves, have been valuable in signaling the Department's attention and commitment to faculty well-being. Furthermore, during periods of disruption and faculty dispersal, it has been helpful to create or re-establish community. One physician on a call commented, \"it's just good to be able to talk to others who are having similar experiences.\" 5 Shared experiences build community and may be protective against secondary trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder. 10 When engaging with faculty, we have also noticed that several strategies can help individual faculty members. Some physicians respond to chaos with excitement and eagerness, but they may still harbor worries. Other physicians may be terrified about their own health but are driven to help others. Acknowledging anxiety and fear of uncertainty will help bridge trust and connectedness, which will strengthen well-being.",

The calls are advertised as part of daily faculty e-mail updates. Participants can call in from home or work. During the calls, participants can describe their experiences about how the pandemic has affected their professional and personal lives.Facilitation is focused on the validation of individual feelings and concerns. Participant dialogue is encouraged and supported. Appropriate resources (eg, COVID-19 practice guidelines, mental health resources) are shared. Participants are asked to reflect on their individual strengths, and how they have used these strengths to help them manage. The call concludes with a brainstorming session around lessons learned, as well as questions to develop additional strategies to maintain physician well-being. Observations Over the last 2 weeks, we have conducted 6 one-hour virtual support calls. Of the 226 Department faculty, 48 (21%) faculty participated in at least one of the calls. Mean attendance has been 8 faculty members. The faculty participants represented all academic ranks and the majority were female. This reflected the general composition of the Department. Most participants called in from their homes. Five common themes have emerged from these calls: fear of personal/family health and safety, concerns about deployment to COVID-19 sites, including competency to care for COVID-19 patients, personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, dilemmas with end of life discussions, and expressions of isolation and loneliness.We have used these calls also to highlight important positive experiences, which may enhance physician well-being. We found that many faculty members have been excited to learn new clinical issues and to engage in new collaborations. Pediatricians are working with and learning from adult hospitalists and subspecialists. Many faculty members are learning how to implement new technology for communication or patient care.",
