Although the mechanism(s) by which that polymorphism exerts these effects remains elusive, given the complex and poorly understood tem-poral interactions among the various cytokines and other inflammatory chemicals in provoking the vSSC and other expressions of a vURTI [4] , the simplest hypothesis can be rejected. Specifically, as reported here and in past studies [12, 14, 16] , higher nasal IL-6 concentrations are positively correlated in both phase and magnitude with the expressed vSSC, leading to the expectation that the high-production IL-6 \u03ea174 phenotype would predict higher nasal IL-6 concentrations and consequently greater illness magnitudes. However, neither of these expectations was supported by the experimental data; that is, no statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between the IL-6 \u03ea174 phenotype and local IL-6 nasal secretion concentration for either experimental RV39 or experimental RSV infection in adults [20] , and for all studies reviewed the low-production (not the high-production) IL-6 \u03ea174 phenotype predicted greater illness and complications [19, 20, 23, 37] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 541, "end": 544, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 639, "end": 643, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 644, "end": 647, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 648, "end": 651, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1227, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1372, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1376, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1380, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1384, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In interpreting these results, it should be recognized that the cytokine phenotypes were assigned on the basis of in vitro results for stimulated cytokine release by leukocytes that may [28, 30, 38] or may not relate to in vivo cytokine production in the nasal mucosa, blood [39, 40] , and local secretions [20] during a vURTI. Moreover, there are a large number of polymorphisms in the genes for IL-6 and other cytokines that were not assayed in the present study but that have the potential to interact with the assayed polymorphisms to influence cytokine production [33, [41] [42] [43] [44] , and past studies have shown that the local production of specific cytokines was influenced by polymorphisms in the genes for other cytokines (eg, the TNF-a \u03ea308 polymorphism predicted IL-6 and IL-8 protein concentrations in nasal secretions) [20] .

In addition, because this study was limited to adults, in whom the frequency of vURTI complications is low, the effects of these cytokine polymorphisms on complication frequency could not be assessed. Nonetheless, it is highly likely that continued study of cytokine polymorphisms in the settings of natural and experimental vURTIs will yield important information regarding the genetic basis for
