            "text": "Nrf2, is a transcription factor encoded in humans by the NFE2L2 gene. It has been called by many the \"master regulator of cellular redox homeostasis\" [1] , as well as the \"guardian of healthspan\" and \"gatekeeper of species longevity\" [2] . Nrf2 regulates most of the genes that defends us against oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutases, catalase, numerous peroxidases, and glutathione metabolism, as well as hundreds of genes involved in scores of important metabolic pathways [3] . The individual vulnerabilities of various structural and catalytic gene products to damage or inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) may lead to degenerative diseases and metabolic dysfunctions. Importantly, Nrf2 declines with age [4, 5] and contributes greatly to the \"frailty\" associated with aging [6, 7] . Because Nrf2 transcriptionally upregulates genes that combat oxidative stress, its loss allows oxidative stress to go unmitigated and drive the aging phenotype. Oxidative stress is therefore a common theme among the key features associated with the aging process, collectively referred to as the \"hallmarks of aging\", as it disrupts proteostasis, alters genomic stability, alters susceptibility to viral and microbial infections, and leads to cell death. It is this age-related frailty that often defines the most vulnerable population in situations such as the one we currently face with the coronavirus pandemic.",

            "text": "A number of published studies have implicated Nrf2 as a regulator of susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. A recent review by Lee [8] points out that virus-induced modulation of the host antioxidative response has turned out to be a crucial determinant for the progression of several viral diseases. A virus needs to keep oxidative stress at a level optimal for viral reproduction, which is higher than normal, to support the viral metabolism but should not be so high as to kill off the host cell. Viruses have evolved mechanisms for manipulating the Nrf2 pathway in both directions, depending on the needs of the virus, but importantly taking control away from the host cell. Among the types of virus studied are influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The phenomenon is also seen in non-respiratory viruses including Dengue virus (DENV) [14] , rotavirus [15] , herpes simplex virus [16] , Zika virus [17] , and HIV [18] , suggesting that regulation of oxidative stress may be a need common to most, if not all viruses, and that Nrf2 activators may offer multiple ways to regain control of important pathways to increase resistance and slow viral replication. We recently described a phytochemical composition, PB125, that potently activates Nrf2 by controlling multiple steps involved in the process, especially via the Akt1/PI3K/GSK3\uf062/Fyn pathway [19] .",

ACE2 mRNA was down regulated -3.5-fold and TMPRSS2 was down-regulated -2.8-fold by PB125 in human liver-derived HepG2 cells, as seen in Figure 2 . While these impediments may not completely block viral entry, they may significantly impair it, slowing the rate of viral progression. Furthermore, PB125 strongly up regulated SERPINE1/PAI-1 by 17.8-fold. PB125 down-regulates HDAC5 in human liver cells by -2.8-fold, also shown in Figure 2 . In humans, HDAC5 appears to be responsible for the deacetylation and attenuation of Nrf2 activity [27] . The cytokine LIF, an important antiviral cellular response to viral infection [28, 29] , was up regulated 6.6-fold by PB125. Because of recent evidence that plasmin can trigger substantial proinflammatory release of cytokines [30] , we examined the effect of PB125 on plasminogen (PLG) mRNA expression, finding it to be down regulated by -1.9-fold. Thus, all six of these gene regulatory effects of PB125 would appear to counter viral attempts to enter the cell and to usurp control of oxidative stress response.",

Kesic et al. showed that siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 expression in human nasal epithelial cells effectively decreased both Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in these cells, which correlated with significantly increased entry of influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 (H3N2 serotype) and replication in the transduced human cells [9] . Importantly, they also demonstrated that enhancing Nrf2 activation via supplementation with sulforaphane (SFN) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) increased antiviral mediators in the absence of viral infection and also abrogated viral entry. Yegeta et al. took a different approach and increased oxidative stress, not just by manipulating Nrf2 expression genetically, but by alternatively exposing mice to an exogenous oxidative stress-cigarette smoke [10] . Cigarette smoke-exposed Nrf2-deficient mice showed higher rates of mortality than did wild-type mice after influenza virus infection, with enhanced peribronchial inflammation, lung permeability damage, and mucus hypersecretion. Cho et al. [31] have similarly studied respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the single most important virus causing acute respiratory tract infections in children. They found that Nrf2 -/-mice infected with RSV showed significantly increased bronchopulmonary inflammation, epithelial injury, and mucus cell metaplasia as well as nasal epithelial injury when compared to similarly infected Nrf2 +/+ WT mice. The Nrf2 -/-mice also showed significantly attenuated viral clearance and IFN-\u03b3, and greater weight loss. Importantly, pretreatment with oral sulforaphane significantly limited lung RSV replication and virus-induced inflammation in Nrf2 +/+ WT mice. Komaravelli et al. [11] [12] [13] have noted that RSV not only causes increased production of ROS but actively lowers expression of antioxidant enzymes by increasing the rate of proteasomal degradation of Nrf2. At 6 h post-infection Nrf2-dependent gene transcription was increased, indicating that the cell is in control and responding to the insult of viral infection and the increase in oxidative stress. By 15 h post-infection, however, the concentration of Nrf2 had dropped significantly to about half its pre-infection level reflecting a change-of-control to favor the virus. To accomplish this RSV had increased Nrf2 ubiquitination, triggering its proteasomal degradation, representing one example by which viruses subvert cellular antioxidant defenses. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the ability of Nrf2 to impede viral entry, slow viral replication, reduce inflammation, weight loss, and mortality, but without providing much detailed insight as to which genes and pathways are involved.",

            "text": "The first challenge facing a virus, and particularly a virus that is jumping from one host species to another, is gaining entry to the cell. There are some fairly common ports of entry such as LDLR and ICAM-1 that lead to endosomal entry and which are shared among various viral families [32] . SARS-CoV-2, however, seems to be largely if not totally restricted to a very specific mode of entry. The unique mode of entry may be the greatest vulnerability for the virus, opening the door to some potentially effective therapies. Substantial evidence suggests that a transmembrane protease encoded by the TMPRSS2 gene plays a critical role in the entry for SARS and MERS coronavirus, for 2013 Asian H7N9 influenza virus, and for several H1N1 subtype influenza A virus infections [25, [33] [34] [35] [36] , suggesting that targeting TMPRSS2 could be a novel antiviral strategy to treat coronavirus [33] . Hoffmann and coworkers found that infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, may depend almost exclusively on the host cell factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [25] . The spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entry depends on binding of the S protein to a cellular receptor, ACE2, which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells. In addition, entry requires S protein \"priming\" by the cellular protease TMPRSS2, which entails S protein cleavage and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes ( Figure 4 ). This priming can be blocked by clinically proven protease inhibitors of the TMPRSS2, Camostat mesylate [25, 37] and Nafamostat mesylate [38] . Nafamostat is remarkably potent with an IC50 in the nanomolar range for blocking cellular entry of MERS-CoV in vitro, but has not been clinically tested as an antiviral in humans. The drug appears not to be available at present in an oral formulation, and because of its lack of specificity there is concern over possible side effects [38] . It may prove suitable for treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.",

[34] found that knockout of TMPRSS2 improved both pathology and immunopathology in the bronchi and/or alveoli after infection of the mice by SARS-CoV and completely prevented loss of body weight. This is especially noteworthy in SARS-CoV infection where TMPRSS2 is not the sole mechanism for entry, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, our data showing that PB125 down regulated ACE2 by -3.5-fold, down regulated TMPRSS2 by -2.8-fold, and up regulated PAI-1, the potent TMPRSS2 inhibitor, by 17.8-fold ( Figure 2 ) strongly suggest that PB125 treatment might diminish the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to bind to a host cell and to obtain spike protein activation as a result of less ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on the cell surface, and as a result of a 17.8-fold increase in plasma PAI-1, which would inhibit the remaining TMPRSS2. Dittmann et al. [26] have found that influenza A virus (IAV) infection provokes a host response that is both necessary and sufficient for viral inhibition-increased production of PAI-1. They found that for IAV, proteolytic cleavage of the viral coat protein hemagglutinin by host proteases (such as plasmin) was a requirement for maturation and infectivity of progeny particles. Addition of recombinant PAI to the apical side of HAEC significantly reduced IAV growth compared to carrier control, with about 90% inhibition of infectivity at 48 h post infection. In contrast, addition of \uf061-PAI-1 antibody dramatically enhanced IAV growth. Thus, many viruses rely on both host endo-and exo-proteases for various entry and maturation functions. Moreover, they found that TMPRSS2 is among the trypsin-like proteases effectively inhibited by PAI-1 [26] .",

            "text": "While we have discussed the role of PAI-1 in preventing TMPRSS2 from activating the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, mention should also be made of what many would consider its \"real job\", the blocking of the conversion of plasminogen (encoded by the PLG gene) to plasmin by both urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Fibrinolysis was the first recognized function for plasmin, so one might expect that high expression of PAI-1 would cause low plasmin levels which might be a risk factor for venous thrombosis. Genetic plasminogen deficiency, however, is not strongly associated with risk of thrombosis [40] . In a study of 23 subjects with homozygous mutations in the PLG gene and little or no detectable plasmin, 96% had clinical inflammation of the conjunctivae (ligneous conjunctivitis) but 0% had experienced venous thrombosis [41] . New roles, however, have been recognized for plasmin regarding cytokine release [30, [42] [43] [44] [45] . A \"cytokine storm syndrome\" is a form of systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as severe infections. It occurs when large numbers of leukocytes are activated and release inflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate yet more leukocytes. Sato et al. found that pharmacological inhibition of plasmin significantly prevented mortality in a mouse model of acute graft-versus-host disease, proposing that plasmin inhibition could offer a novel therapeutic strategy to control the deadly cytokine storm that results from graft-versus-host disease, preventing tissue destruction [43] . Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by a cytokine storm and multiorgan dysfunction due to excessive immune activation. In a mouse model of MAS, Shimazu et al. saw a similar prevention in lethality, concluding that plasmin regulates the influx of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [30] . Plasminogen has also been implicated in activation of astrocytes to produce an array of proinflammatory cytokines [45] . In Figure 2 we report that PB125 downregulates plasminogen mRNA by -1.9-fold in liver cells. Thus, in vivo we speculate that the combined downregulation of plasminogen and 17.8-fold increase of PAI-1 (which covalently reacts with and deactivates both tissue-and urokinase-type plasminogen activators) may significantly attenuate the plasmin-induced cytokine storm phenomenon.",

            "text": "We speculate that the well-documented age-related loss of Nrf2 expression [4, 5] is a potential contributor to the occurrence of a cytokine storm. A longitudinal study of 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients [47] showed that the 13 severe cases, compared to the 27 milder cases, were older (mean age 59.7 vs 43.2), had significantly elevated C-reactive protein (mean 62.9 vs 7.6 mg/l), and showed consistently higher neutrophil counts and lower lymphocyte counts throughout the two week observation period. These observations [46, 47] document a clear predilection for severity of COVID-19 infection directly associated with age and intensity of inflammatory response, and presumably inversely associated with Nrf2 expression. The production and self-amplifying nature of an acute inflammatory response demands a prompt subsequent \"survival response\" from the host tissue to break the self-sustaining attraction of neutrophils to inflamed tissues. We propose that it is a robust oxidative stress-induced activation of Nrf2 in young healthy individuals that follows the gathering storm and rescues host tissues from irretrievable self-inflicted damage. In older individuals, or in the presence of comorbidities that may involve chronic inflammation, the Nrf2-activation response may be insufficient to break the self-perpetuating cycle of events. Figure 5 illustrates this proposed sequence of events. We propose that activating a larger fraction of the limited Nrf2 available in the elderly or otherwise compromised patients might allow them, like their younger counterparts, to shut down cytokine production to stop the escalating cytokine storm, and to begin the recovery and repair phase of the inflammatory episode. This activation boost to suboptimal levels of Nrf2 can be provided by several pharmacological agents, and as well or better by a number of phytochemical activators, as we show here with PB125.",

Ferritin has long been recognized as a source of iron released under inflammatory conditions by the superoxide radical [48] [49] [50] [51] . Under the intense oxidative stress precipitated by a cytokine storm, the release of iron would catalyze lipid peroxidation and greatly amplify host tissue injury. COVID-19 has already been added to the short list of known \"hyperferritinemic\" diseases, all of which are characterized by high serum ferritin and life threatening hyper-inflammation sustained by a cytokines storm which eventually leads to multi-organ failure [52] . Ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated cell death that is iron-dependent and causes cell death by mitochondrial dysfunction and toxic lipid peroxidation. Nrf2 has been implicated as a \"key deterministic component modulating the onset and outcomes of ferroptotic stress\" [53] .",

            "text": "An obvious weakness of our study is that we did not directly study either SARS-CoV-2, or the cells that most likely provide the virus its point of entry (lung epithelial cells). However, we studied three different phenomena that may be involved in vulnerability, but these interactive phenomena are not all present in any single cell type. The first objective, to study the effects of PB125 on expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, should be studied in the presumed point-of-entry cells, and the objective is most specific for SARS-CoV-2. We plan to examine multiple lung cell types using single-cell RNAseq analysis. There are both clinical and laboratory suggestions that the virus may invade many organs in the body, including liver where we showed down regulation of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A second objective was to examine whether PB125 could limit systemic plasmin activity by down regulation of PLG and/or upregulation of PAI-1, both plasma proteins not produced by the cells entered by the virus. In this case, the liver is the source of PLG, so we did look at the appropriate cell type. The source of PAI-1 in plasma isn't known, but may be liver or muscle. For the third objective of whether PB125 could down regulate the cytokines identified as participating in the cytokine storm phenomenon, we believe the focus on primary HPAEC is appropriate, although a more complete picture would include study of the inflammatory cell types themselves. HPAEC get a local alarm signal from the infected epithelial lung cells, but it is the HPAEC that actually generate the 36 cytokines we examined, sounding the systemic alarm that brings the inflammatory cells to the infected organ. For studying how an intervention can break the inflammatory cycle, we believe vascular endothelial cells may be the most important players.",

            "text": "Importantly, the point-of-entry host protein TMPRSS2, a membrane-bound serine protease, appears to be an essential requirement for SARS-Cov-2 (COVID- 19) virus. TMPRSS2 appears amenable to inhibition by PAI-1, encoded by the SERPINE1 gene which is upregulated by PB125. The TMPRSS2 gene itself appears to be down-regulated by PB125 which would serve to decrease its activity further. The downregulation of HDAC5 by PB125 would lead to an increase in acetylation of Nrf2, and an increase in its activity. The upregulation of LIF by PB125 would be expected protect the lung from viral-induced pathology during infection, as LIF knock-down increased virus titers. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, PB125 substantially suppresses production of multiple major contributors to the cytokine storm syndrome, now known to be the direct cause of death in most COVID-19 fatalities. It seems possible that the sum total of these multiple antiviral effects may attenuate symptoms, and perhaps allow successful navigation through the \"cytokine storm.\" Even though the never-ending evolutionary war-of-wits continues, and the viruses occasionally win a battle, this scenario of the complex and multi-faceted antiviral mechanisms regulated by Nrf2 serves to underscore the importance of this very central transcription factor in keeping us protected and functional.

Alternatively, in 4a) older cells deficient in Nrf2 may be unable to mount Nrf2 activation sufficient to break the self-sustaining chain reaction, resulting in an uncontrolled cytokine storm that ultimately destroys the host tissue and leads to death.
