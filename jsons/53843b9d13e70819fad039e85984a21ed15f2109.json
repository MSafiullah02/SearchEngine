The most common symptoms within 2-14 days include fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, and dyspnea . As of March 1, 2020, the mortality rate was 3.6% in China and 1.5% outside China (Baud et al. 2020) , and as of March 14, 2020, 135 countries/territories had confirmed cases (World Health Organization 2020). With the extremely high infection rate and relatively high mortality, individuals naturally began worrying about the COVID-19. Indeed, fear of contacting individuals who are possibly infected by COVID-19 has been reported (Lin 2020) . Unfortunately, fear may amplify the damage of the disease itself. The emergence of the COVID-19 (Guan et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020 ) and its pandemic nature has exacerbated fears worldwide leading to stigma in some cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020a, b; Lin 2020). One characteristic nature of infectious disease compared with other conditions is fear. Fear is directly associated with its transmission rate and medium (rapidly and invisibly) as well as its morbidity and mortality. This further leads to other psychosocial challenges including stigmatization, discrimination, and loss (Pappas et al. 2009 ). With the high levels of fear, individuals may not think clearly and rationally when reacting to However, current treatment on COVID-19 worldwide has mainly focused on infection control, effective vaccine, and treatment cure rate (Dong et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) . The psychosocial aspect has yet to be thoroughly considered. Nevertheless, as countries worldwide have to work on reducing the transmission rate of COVID-19, they should also work on individual fears to achieve the holistic goal of having a society free of COVID-19. One of the reasons that current treatment on COVID-19 pays little attention to the fear of COVID-19 is the lack of an appropriate psychometric instrument. Therefore, developing a brief and valid instrument to capture an individual's fear of COVID-19 is both timely and important. With the information on how an individual fears COVID-19, healthcare providers can further design appropriate programs to take care of the fear. Therefore, this study developed and validated a scale assessing the fear of coronavirus-the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) (see \"Appendix\" section)-using two types of psychometric testing: classical test theory (CTT) analysis and Rasch analysis. Consequently, the FCV-19S will be useful in providing valuable information on fear of COVID-19 so as to facilitate public health initiatives on allaying public's fears.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 314, "text": "(Baud et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 645, "end": 655, "text": "(Lin 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 754, "end": 772, "text": "(Guan et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 773, "end": 790, "text": "Huang et al. 2020", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1286, "text": "(Pappas et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1537, "text": "(Dong et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1555, "text": "Wang et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Several steps were taken to develop the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (McCoach et al. 2013) .

Relevant and possible items were pooled by two researchers (i.e., the third and last authors). After removing those items with similar content or expressions, 28 items were retained for further evaluation. Second, an expert panel (comprising a psychologist, virologist, health psychologist, psychiatrist, general physician, and nurse) evaluated the 28 items, and 11 items were deleted based on the suggestion from the expert panel. Third, the retained 17 items were sent out to a different expert panel (comprising a health education specialist, pulmonologist, social psychologist, and sociologist in Iran) to review. Seven items were further omitted based on the comments from the second expert panel. Finally, the 10-item scale was piloted on 46 individuals (26 males and 20 females, mean age 39.63 years, number of years in education = 9.38 years) to obtain initial assessment of the scale. A four-point Likert scale was used to test whether the individuals understand the item descriptions. The results showed that all respondents fully understood the item descriptions (mean 3.81, SD = 1.04). Additionally, an individual telephone-based cognitive interview was implemented on the same pilot participants to explore their thoughts about each scale item and their responses.
