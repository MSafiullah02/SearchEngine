            "text": "The study of complex networks has attracted much attention and provides us an opportunity to understand the relationship between system topology and network activities (or dynamics)  [1]. The entities and relationship between them are represented by vertices and edges respectively. During the past decades, various networks have been investigated, such us, the World Wide Web, transportation network, the networks of scientific and movie actors collaborations, as well as the epidemic spreading process  [2], [3], [4], [5]. Nevertheless, in practice, most networks are not isolated; and they are interconnected with each other due to the existence of common components. Various infrastructures, like power supply system, water supply system, transportation system, are interacted with each other. Thus, numerous researchers recently have devoted efforts to the study of novel networks in order to investigate phenomena being absent in isolated networks  [6]. Furthermore, the real-world networks usually exhibit layered properties, i.e. the links in different layer represents the connections in various environments. In this sense, these types of networks are encapsulated into the framework of multiplex networks, which seem to be applicable to modeling lots of real-world systems, like the European air transport system  [7], the global cargo ship network  [8].",

Here, the infected individuals might be recovered due to the adoption of medical treatments or self-rehabilitation. For this class of diseases, the susceptible-infected-recovered (or succinctly, SIR) model is presented in order to mimic the corresponding epidemic spreading process  [18], [19]. In  [20], the SIR model is adopted to investigate the epidemic spreading process in two interacting networks numerically. Then, corresponding epidemic spreading thresholds in different communities and internetworks are determined accordingly. An analytical approach is developed in  [21], where two SIR propagations over multiplex networks are thoroughly investigated. According to previous discussions, the awareness of a susceptible individual plays an important role in the epidemic spreading process  [14], [22], [23]. Hence, the SIR model is applied to multiplex networks consisting of two different layers, i.e., a virtual layer and a physical one  [24]. The information is transmitting on the virtual layer through internet tools while the epidemic spreading process is performed on the physical layer. Furthermore, the dynamics of the epidemic spreading process is further investigated either simulation-based or theoretically  [25], [26], [27], [28], [29] based on the traditional SIR or SIS model.",

For an infectious individual, it will be immune once recovered and will not be affected in the future. Nevertheless, the dead individual will be removed from the investigated community forever. Though the epidemic is incapable of being transmitted through either recovered or dead individuals, the recovered individual is capable of informing corresponding neighbors about the fatal epidemic. Hence, preventive measures can be taken to reduce the probability of infection, such as, reducing the frequency of outside activities, wearing face masks, washing hands frequently, taking the vaccination, doing exercises, reducing contacts with other individuals and so forth  [30], [31], [32]. In this work, in order to clarify the difference between recovery and death, a susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD) model is considered to couple with the awareness dynamics, i.e., unaware-aware-unaware (UAU) model in virtual layers, being referred as a UAU-SIRD model. In this model, recovered individuals with awareness can inform susceptible neighbors who will take some preventive measures to reduce the infection probability. Nevertheless, if an infectious individual is dead, corresponding connections should be removed. Furthermore, to validate the accuracy of simulations, theoretical formulas are also derived.",

However, this seems inconsistent with empirical case: the recovery usually needs several days, or even months even under effective medical treatment. Hence, in this manuscript, the infected individual will transmit the disease to its susceptible neighbors with a prespecified probability and the infected individual is recovered after a fixed time. This recovery model is adopted and a modified probability transition tree by incorporating recovery and death is presented. Furthermore, the required recovery time steps are not necessarily to be a fixed value even under the same medical treatment. This is due to the fact of different physical conditions of the infected individuals. We make some revision to the proposed UAU-SIRD model by considering the recovery property, while theoretical analyses are also performed for validation.",

Later, we also consider the fact of necessary time periods before fully recovered. Furthermore, theoretical analyses are also performed to validate the correctness of proposed models.

Each layer can be indicated by a graph G = (V, E) where V and E represent the node and link sets respectively. The link set is usually indicated by an adjacent matrix, i.e., if a link exists between nodes i and j, then aij = 1. Otherwise, aij = 0. For the virtual layer, links indicate the virtual connections among individuals through internet tools (e.g., Facebook, twitter); while information about the epidemic is exchanged through these connections. Whereas on the physical one, links denote the physical contacts through which biological elements carrying the virus of epidemic are transmitted. A community consisting of six individuals is presented as in Fig. 1\nfor an illustration. Here, the community is composed of two layers; while each layer has six nodes and different numbers of connections.",

For example, a susceptible individual is likely to remain susceptible or be infected because of direct contacts with infected neighbors.

Hence, the effects of incorporating virtual layer on the epidemic spreading process can also be analyzed. The analyses here are conducted through MC simulation, which is furthermore validated through theoretical analyses. Simulation stops if stationary states or anticipated time steps are achieved.

In such a case, preventive measures can be taken, and the infection probability is multiplied by a factor \u03b3 (0 <  \u03b3  < 1). This indicates that the awareness of epidemic can reduce the infection probability of epidemic, which is also consistent with common sense.

For fixed \u03bc, the proportion of individuals being affected reduces with the increase of \u03bb. This is due to the reason that it is more easily for the epidemic information spreading process among nodes on the virtual layer.
