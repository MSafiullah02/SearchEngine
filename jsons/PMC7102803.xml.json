            "text": "In the past two decades, natural disasters have caused millions of deaths worldwide, and hundreds of millions of people have suffered from various types of physical or mental traumas. The 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001 caused worldwide panic; the 2004 Richter scale 9 earthquake and tsunami in South Asia resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties in coastal areas, and the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, China, claimed hundreds of thousands of casualties. In the past 10 years, Taiwan has been hit with various small-scale disasters such as traffic accidents, airplane crashes including crashes of China Airlines and Singapore Airlines, train derailment of the Alishan Railway, as well as the collapse of the Pingtung Bridge and the Lincoln Mansions in Taipei County. In addition, Taiwan has experienced several large-scale disasters, including the catastrophic destruction produced by the Chi-Chi Earthquake in 1999, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic in 2003, the 8/8 floods in southern Taiwan in 2009, and the Morakot Typhoon, which resulted in the tragic destruction of Xiaolin village. Because of their geographic location, many Asian countries are at a higher risk for natural disasters. According to statistical data from the Red Cross Society, Asia is more disaster-prone than any other areas in the world.1 Repeated disasters alter thinking patterns and the concept of security within a community. The recent onslaught of disasters highlights the need for disaster psychiatry and the importance of mental rehabilitation.2\n",

The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD allow clinicians to specify whether the disorder is chronic (if the symptoms have lasted 3 months or more) or exhibits delayed onset (if the onset of symptoms was 6 months or more after the stressful event).",

Generally, the lifetime and immediate prevalence rates for psychiatric disorders range anywhere from 1% to 74%,34, 35, 36, 37, 38 affecting women twice more than men. Furthermore, women report more symptoms of anxiety and depression than men.36, 37\n",

Several years after the impact of the disaster, the prevalence of most psychiatric disorders will decline; however, rates of substance abuse and suicide have been shown to increase.9, 24 Mental rehabilitation is not only important as a short-term intervention, but also as a long-term follow-up mechanism. It can also prove useful in identifying cases that should be referred for further psychiatric management. Hobfoll\u2019s Conservation of Resources (COR) model has been well substantiated by previous studies on natural disasters.39 According to Hobfoll\u2019s COR stress theory,4, 40 resource loss is an important determinant of individual stress, physical and mental health, and vulnerability to developing PTSD. Brewin et al41 also found that although the effect sizes of all risk factors were modest, factors operating during or after the trauma such as trauma severity, lack of social support, and additional life stress, had somewhat stronger effects than did pre-trauma factors.",

According to Hobfoll\u2019s COR theory, resource loss is an important determinant of individual stress and physical and mental health, including PTSD.

Furthermore, unresolved, subclinical psychiatric symptoms caused by a disaster or major life event may increase a survivor\u2019s sensitivity to future stresses. When faced with either stressful life events or trauma such as brain damage or deprivation of internal or external resources, individuals may become more vulnerable to psychiatric impairment and disorders such as PTSD.

They demonstrated that an Emergency Operation Center (EOC) should be set up as quickly as possible, generally within 1\u20138 h. The EOC should provide the central government with updates on the situation, as the scale of the EOC will depend on the degree of the emergency.

Multiple rescue teams, including the administrative team, the public health and medical teams, and the engineering and rescue-worker teams, should be involved during the urgent initial stages. An emergency management system should be established to effectively intervene immediately after a disaster. Systematic mental rehabilitation should then be performed 1\u20133 months after the disaster.",
