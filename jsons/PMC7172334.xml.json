The cavities are surrounded by bone and cartilage with a midline septum, floors formed by the hard palate and lateral walls formed by the palatine, maxillary and ethmoid bones which support the three turbinates. The meati beneath the turbinates are the sites into which drain the posterior ethmoidal sinus (superior meatus), other ethmoidal cells, maxillary and frontal sinuses (middle meatus) and the nasolachrymal duct (inferior meatus). The sphenoid sinus drains into the sphenoethmoidal recess behind the superior turbinate. Obstruction to drainage by anatomical variation or mucosal disease around the narrow ostial meati is the cause of much sinus pathology. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) with flexible nasendoscopy allows surgeons to visualize sinus disease and has improved the quality of surgery to improvement the drainage of the sinuses and the removal of diseased tissues.",

The sinonasal (Schneiderian) epithelium is derived from ectoderm and, in children, the nasal cavities and sinuses are lined by pseudostratified, ciliated columnar epithelium apart from the olfactory epithelium. Exposure to airborne particles during the first two decades of life leads to squamous metaplasia of the nasal vestibule. The luminal surface of a normal columnar cell has approximately 200 cilia which project into the gel phase of the mucus and beat in a coordinated manner at 10\u201320 Hz.",

Fungi are common airborne allergens and can be cultured from the nasal secretions of most healthy individuals7; consequently, the diagnosis of fungal sinusitis relies on the histological recognition of fungi in sinus tissue. As the density of fungal elements varies from sparse to extensive, special stains (Grocott and diastase-PAS) should be used routinely when examining sinonasal biopsies, particularly those from immunocompromised individuals. The morphology of fungal hyphae is of limited value in distinguishing between fungal species and cultures should always be performed. The irregular broad hyphae of Mucor sp. are characteristic and dichotomously branching septate hyphae are seen in diseases associated with Aspergillus sp. and the dematiaceous fungi (Figure 5, Figure 6\n).",

While eosinophils are characteristically seen in patients with allergies to pollen, fungi, bacterial proteins such as Staphylococcus aureus superantigen or aspirin, they are also seen in patients with no demonstrable allergies (NARES).",

The prevalence in Europe is approximately five per 100,000 with more cases described in more northern latitudes. The cause of Wegener's granulomatosis is unknown but neutrophils are regarded as key to the pathogenesis of the acute injury causing endothelial damage and being targets for the autoimmune response.35, 36 Genetic factors and complex alterations in T helper cell responses promote granuloma formation.37 Most patients present with sinusitis, nasal discharge or bleeding and the disease can destroy the nasal septum.38 Seventy percent of patients will develop crescentic glomerulonephritis and many will have systemic symptoms reflecting small-vessel inflammation in the lungs, skin, joints and nerves. The diagnosis is facilitated by testing for C-ANCA which is directed against neutrophil proteinase-3 (PR3-ANCA) in 90% patients, or myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA). For entry into European clinical trials, a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis requires a history of chronic inflammation for at least four weeks which is not attributable to another cause, supported by characteristic biopsy histology and/or detectable C-ANCA and/or detectable PR3-ANCA.39 Confirmatory histology in non-renal biopsies requires an inflammatory infiltrate that is dominated by neutrophils accompanied by at least one of necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis, granulomas or giant cells (Figure 19\n).
