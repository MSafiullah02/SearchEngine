Results of Attn-BioDeepRank, although lower, suggest that this version is at least nearly as effective at ranking the documents as the model that uses the recursive layer. Biomedical Document Retrieval. We report results on the BioASQ 6b and BioASQ 7b document ranking tasks (Table 2) . Regarding BioASQ 6b, it should be noted that the retrieved documents were evaluated against the final goldstandard of the task, revised after reevaluating the documents submitted by the participating systems. Since we expect that some of the retrieved documents would have been revised as true positives, the results presented can be considered a lower bound of the system's performance. For BioASQ 7b, the results shown are against the gold-standard before the reevaluation, since the final annotations were not available at the time of writing. In this dataset both systems achieved performance nearer to the best result, including a top result on Batch 1. Passage Evaluation. Finally, we analysed whether the information used by the model for ranking the documents, as given by the attention weights, corresponded to relevant passages in the gold-standard. For this, we calculated the precision of the passages, considering overlap with the gold-standard, and evaluated how it related to the confidence assigned by the model. Interestingly, although the model is not trained with this information, the attention weights seem to focus on these relevant passages, as indicated by the results in Fig. 3.   Fig. 3 .
