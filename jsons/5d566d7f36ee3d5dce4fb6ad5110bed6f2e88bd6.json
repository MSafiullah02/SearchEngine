Slightly more than half of the cloned ribosomal protein genes are represented by two isoforms in yeast, whereas there are over 100 copies of the rRNA genes in the genome. One would expect that the mof mutants would be associated with ribosomal protein genes rather than rRNAs, because a mutation in only one copy of an rRNA gene would be expected to be masked by the presence of over 100 copies of the wild-type gene. Surprisingly, mOf9-1, which increases the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting 2.5to 3-fold, is complemented by a clone of 5s rRNA on either a single or high copy vector.2' The mof9-1 mutation maps to the yeast rDNA locus, and two other independent mutations of 5s rRNA at that locus also have the MOB-phenotype and can be complemented by wild-type 5s rRNA. Mutant 5s rRNAs expressed from episomal vectors as 20-50% of total cellular 5s rRNA also have the Mof9-phenotype. The mof9 mutants also increase the efficiency of +1 ribosomal frameshifting directed by a Tyl frameshift signal, but have no effect upon readthrough of UAG or UUA termination codons, indicating that not all translational specificity is affected. There is no detectable increase in the amount of steady-state l a c 2 mRNA transcribed from the -1 ribosomal frameshift test plasmid. Therefore the increased amount of P-gal activity is the direct result of an increase in the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting, and is not due to a defect in the nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation pathway.
