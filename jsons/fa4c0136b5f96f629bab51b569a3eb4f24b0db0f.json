However, many changes are discontinuous due to sudden interventions, such as city lockdown and opening of field hospitals. To model the discontinuities, this study introduces the tool of total variation regularization, which regulates the temporal changes of the dynamic parameters, such as the transmission rate. To recover the ground truth dynamic, this study designs a novel yet straightforward optimization algorithm, dubbed iterative Nelder-Mead, which repeatedly applies the Nelder-Mead algorithm. Experiments on the simulated data show that the proposed approach can qualitatively reproduce the discontinuities of the underlying dynamics. To extend this research to real data as well as to help researchers worldwide to fight against COVID-19, the author releases his research platform as an open-source package.",

This family of models divides the population into several compartments, among which each individual transfers according to some dynamic. For instance, the SIR model prescribes three compartments, with the Susceptible compartment for those vulnerable, the Infectious compartment for those contagious, and the Removed compartment for those either obtained immunity after the recovery or died from the infection (Figure 1 ). The dynamic, on the other hand, governs the mechanic of how each individual transfers among these three compartments.",

It is used, among others, in image denoising, wherein it successfully restores the sharpness of images. The hence restored object has a well-known staircase visual effect.

The former is more general and can additionally capture invisible phase shifts induced by, say, viral evolution.

This is essentially the removed compartment in SIR used for. If the hospitalization is imperfect (i.e., a part of patients are not confirmed and have to be nature selected), this is a perfect scenario for the SIRQ model, where the confirmed cases can be associated with the quarantined compartment.

Therefore, we have to rely on some zero-order algorithm. One algorithm I see fit is the Nelder-Mead method (a.k.a. downhill simplex method), which is prevalent in civil engineering. For example, to build a suspension bridge, an engineer has to choose the thickness of each strut, cable, and pier. These elements are interdependent, and it is not easy to determine the impact of changing any specific element. Analogously, in our context, changing the value of the dynamic at any single point is unlikely to have a significant impact on the whole epidemic (the integral does not depend on the function values on a null set).",

On the one hand, when the observation is sparse, there are many candidate dynamics able to reproduce the observation accurately; each candidate then forms a valley. On the other hand, constant dynamics do not suffer from the regularization penalty, and the modification on a single point will not affect the overall dynamic (null set) but does increase total variation, so each constant dynamic also forms a valley. The optimization algorithm can therefore be easily trapped in some local optimum. To mitigate the influence of multimodality, I designed the iterative Nelder-Mead algorithm, which repeatedly rerun Nelder-Mead on the new local optimum (Algorithm 1).",

During the experiments, I discovered that the regularization hyperparameter (weight) plays a critical role in defining the hardship of the problem by altering the topology of the objective function. Indeed, when the regularization weight is small, the objective function has many equally good local minima: the desired local minimum hides among its peers. When the regularization weight is large, the objective function contains fewer local minima, but each minimum is like an abyss: once the solver loses its way into one abyss, it has no chance to ever escape. Therefore, the regularization weight should be something in-between -highlight the desired local minimum while preserving the smoothness of the objective function ( Figure 5 ).",
