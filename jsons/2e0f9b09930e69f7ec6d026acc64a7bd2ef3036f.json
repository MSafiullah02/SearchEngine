            "text": "In 2005, human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) was isolated and identified from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia in Hong Kong. To identify and classify genotypes of HCoV-HKU1 in Korea, a sensitive, specific, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed and analyzed the sequences of HCoV-HKU1 isolated in Korea. A total of 1,985 respiratory specimens taken from patients with acute respiratory illness were tested for HCoV-HKU1 from January 2007 to May 2008. The major clinical symptoms associated with HCoV-HKU1 infection were examined statistically and sequence variations of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid genes were also analyzed. Fifty cases (2.5%) HCoV-HKU1 were identified by real-time PCR and viral loads ranged from 6.7 \u00c2 10 4 to 1.6 \u00c2 10 9 copies/ml. The clinical symptoms of HCoV-HKU1 infection included rhinorrhea (72%), cough (64%), nasal congestion (56%), fever (32%), sputum (30%), sore throat (18%), chills (16%), postnasal discharge (14%), and tonsillar hypertrophy (10%). There was a seasonal distribution of HCoV-HKU1 infection, peaking in winter and spring. Both genotypes A and B were detected but no recombination between them was found. This is the first report on the identification and genotyping of HCoV-HKU1 as a causative agent of acute respiratory illness in Korea. The data suggest that at least two genotypes, A and B, of HCoV-HKU1 with scattered silent mutations were circulating in Korea from 2007 to 2008.",

Chung et al. [2007] also tried to identify the virus in patients with acute expiratory wheezing in Korea but evidence of HCoV-HKU1 infection was not found. These negative results arose from several limitations such as an insensitive diagnostic strategy, selection of samples out of season as well as the relatively small number of patients studied. To circumvent these limitations, a quantitative real-time PCR was developed and targeted a study group of 1,985 throat swab specimens collected from patients with an acute respiratory illness from January 2007 to May 2008.",

Each shadowed number indicates the specimen identification number, and reference sequences are marked as GenBank accession numbers. Phylogenetic trees are shown of (A) the RdRp gene (897 neucleotide (nt)), (B) the S gene (309 nt), and (C) the N gene (425 nt). Primer sequences were excluded from phylogenetic analysis. [Woo et al., 2009] and China [Jin et al., 2010] but an apparently higher rate was noted in Chinese study because of different clinical practices. Unlikely, apparent lower incidence (0.3%, n \u00bc 4,181) of HCoV-HKU1 in patients with acute respiratory tract in Hong Kong was reported by Lau et al. [2006] . Relatively high incidence of HCoV-HKU1 in Korea might have resulted from difference of target study group and/or sensitivity of detection strategy. Even though the quantified viral loads varied from 6.7 \u00c2 10 4 to 1.6 \u00c2 10 9 copies/ ml in the respiratory disease specimens used, there were no significant correlations between viral load and specific clinical features. Similarly, there were no statistically significant relationships between the HCoV-HKU1 infection and any particular clinical symptoms. As for seasonal prevalence, the HCoV-HKU1 infections prevailed in the winter and spring in Korea and this result was consistent with the infection rates of HCoV-OC43, 229E and with other reports [Lau et al., 2006; Domiquez et al., 2009; Gaunt et al., 2010] . One limitation of this study was that because clinical specimens were chosen from negative cases of acute respiratory illness in the ARI-Net laboratory surveillance system [Chun et al., 2009] , dual or multiple infections of HCoV-HKU1 with other respiratory viruses could not be detected.",

When single reciprocal nucleotide exchanges were analyzed between the RdRp, S, and N genes, no recombination could be identified. Instead, several point mutations were observed at the nucleotide level, resulting in a transition (C to T) or a transversion (C to T or T to C) in the RdRp, S, and N genes. However, these were silent mutations so that no changes occurred at the amino acid level. Interestingly, a silent continuous mutation in the N gene was identified from 6/8 isolates of HCoV-HKU1 genotype B.
