Viruses are generally choosy about who or what they will inhabit, although the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza are two examples of viral pathogens jumping species to humans; HIV is another. Parasites prefer to keep within animal classes, although there is usually sharing between genera.",

These parasites can also infect some non-human primates.1\nP falciparum can infect owl and squirrel monkeys, and P vivax infects chimpanzees. P malariae may have come from chimpanzees originally, and in South America, has gone from humans back into primates, becoming P brasil-ianum (from which it is genetically indistinguishable).2, 3 That monkey malarias could also infect humans was known from the days before penicillin, when patients with neurosyphilis were treated by giving them malaria (malaria therapy). P knowlesi, first described in India in 1931, was soon evaluated as an alternative to the use of human malaria parasites for malaria therapy. Since then, P knowlesi infection has been used as a model, mainly in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) in which the infection is lethal.",

            "text": "There have been rare reports of natural human infections with monkey parasites, but nothing like on the scale reported by Balbir Singh and colleagues in this week's Lancet. P knowlesi, misidentified previously as P malariae, accounted for about 58% of malaria cases in Kapit division in Sarawak, which is also inhabitated by the parasites' natural hosts, the long-tailed (M fascicularis) and pig-tailed (M nemestrina) macaques. Misidentification by microscopy is understandable because the morphology of the asexual stages of the monkey malaria parasites are not very different from that of human parasites, particularly on thick blood-films (used when the degree of parasitaemia is low), and laboratory technicians are trained to recognise only the four species of human parasites. In Singh's report, astute clinical and parasitological observations combined with good epidemiology and molecular genotyping uncovered this remarkable focus of infection. Acquisition of primate malarias could explain occasional reports of malaria in people exploring or travelling through uninhabited jungle areas or nature reserves.",

            "text": "What are the practical implications? We may be sharing P knowlesi, and perhaps other primate malarias, more commonly than appreciated. Such a situation would be particularly likely in forest-dwelling communities. As Singh points out, we need to identify the anopheline mosquito vector to devise appropriate control strategies and determine whether this parasite is being transmitted from human to human, as can happen experimentally. The general rule that malaria must be excluded in any patient with fever travelling to a tropical area holds, even if that includes uninhabited forest. Microscopically P knowlesi looks like P falciparum when it is young and P malariae when it is older. But P malariae multiplies every 3 days in the blood (tertian cycle) and infections are never severe, whereas P knowlesi multiplies daily (quotidian cycle), and is potentially dangerous. Because monkeys have not been using anti-malarials as we humans have, their malaria parasites are drug-sensitive, and treatment is straightforward.",
