The HA protein facilitates the viral binding and entering a host cell and the NA protein helps the release of viral progeny from the infected cell. The complementary roles of HA and NA entail their collaboration, which has important implications for viral replication and fitness. The HA protein from early strains of pandemic 2009 H1N1 of swine origin preferentially binds to human type receptors with a weak binding to avian type receptors. This virus caused several human deaths in December 2013 in Texas, USA, which motivated us to investigate the changes of genetic features that might contribute to the surged virulence of the virus. Our time series analysis on the strains of this virus collected from 2009 to 2013 implied that the HA binding preference of this virus in USA, Europe, and Asia has been the characteristic of swine H1N1 virus since 2009.",

            "text": "I NFLUENZA viruses can infect humans, swine, and avian species. Influenza A virus has an envelope, which is subtyped according to its two surface proteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Both proteins recognize the glycan receptors on host cells, and they help the viral entry into and release of virions from host cells respectively. Wild aquatic birds are the reservoir of all influenza viruses found in different species [1] . HA is further cleaved into protein HA1 and protein HA2, the first of which binds to cellular receptors Manuscript and the second mediates membrane fusion [2] . The HA and NA proteins play important roles in virulence, host specificity, and the human immune response. A functional balance of HA binding and NA cleavage is observed in the life cycle of human viruses, which is also needed for a zoonotic virus to cross the species boundary to efficiently transmit and reproduce in humans [3] , [4] . Seasonal influenza viruses tend to bind receptors found on cells in the nose, throat, and upper airway to infect the respiratory tract of humans. The receptor binding site of HA is composed of three major structural elements: a 190-helix, a 220-loop, and a 130-loop (H3 numbering) [5] . The HAs of various viruses have different specificities for recognizing the sialic acids (SA) linked to galactose on the surface of host cells. The HAs of human viruses preferentially bind to oligosaccharides that terminate with sialic acid linked to galactose by -linkages (human type receptors), while the HAs of avian influenza favor oligosaccharides that terminate with a sialic acid linked to galactose by -linkages (avian type receptors). In aquatic birds avian type receptors dominate in tracheal epithelial cells, but in terrestrial birds both avian-type and human-type receptors are detected in their tracheal epithelial cells [6] . Also pigs have both human and avian receptors [7] . The receptors are extensively detected in all areas of the respiratory tract of pigs with an average of 80-100% at the epithelial cells. On the contrary, the receptors are not present at epithelial cells of nose, trachea, and most bronchi, but are found in small amounts in bronchioles, and in alveoli reaching an average of 20-40% at the epithelial cells [8] . The receptor cells are usually present in the upper airway of humans, while the receptor cells are most in the lungs. These findings suggest swine and avian species that express both and receptors could serve as an intermediate host for the emergence of new viral strains to infect humans, since this kind of adaptation often requires successful interspecies transmission.",

            "text": "The pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus of swine origin emerged in Mexico in March 2009 and quickly became a worldwide health threat in 2009. It resulted from reassortment of several viruses of swine origin. In particular, its NA gene was derived from Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1, and the HA gene from a triple-reassortant virus circulating in North American swine [9] , [10] . This virus caused over 284 000 deaths within the first year of the pandemic, although its infections were characterized with mostly mild symptoms [11] . Further, the epidemiology of this virus was unique as it had a bigger impact on younger adults and older children. Unlike seasonal human H1N1 viruses, which bind mainly to receptors, the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus could bind to both and receptors although the primary binding is receptors [12] , [13] . The functions of HA and NA requires coordination and interdependence of their activity. The HA from the early strains of human 2009 H1N1 demonstrated lower binding avidity than the swine progenitor HA, due to amino acid substitutions near the receptor binding site. At the same time, the virus acquired an NA enzyme of relatively low activity through reassortment. In contrast to this functional match, the swine progenitors often deviate from such a functional balance. Therefore, appropriately matched activities of HA and NA from zoonotic viruses might be indicators of transmission efficiency in humans [3] , [4] , [14] , [15] .",

In comparison of the two proteins, HA could bind to or receptors, whereas NA has a marked preference for receptors although it can cleave both types [18] . However, the NA of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 shows a distinctive enzymatic profile, which hydrolyzes receptors as efficiently as avian viruses and hydrolyzes receptor as efficiently as classical swine viruses [19] . In the flu season of 2013, the predominant strain of influenza was pandemic 2009 H1N1 in the south-central United States, where several human deaths were reported in Texas (health.usnews.com and www.usatoday.com). In search of any altered molecular features from this virus that might lead to its recent increase of virulence as observed in Texas, we sought to discover, with a computational approach developed in [20] - [39] , any variations in the HA binding patterns of the strains collected from 2009 to 2013. Due to their closely interacting roles, a balance needs to be maintained in the HA and NA functional activity, which could be mediated by genetic changes in HA and NA. Following this view, we also quantified the NA activity of this virus in association with the HA receptor binding.",

In the previous work [41] , [42] , a product of their IS was employed to find the most prominent frequency, but here we sought to discover several top frequencies as Influenza viruses tend to display multiple binding patterns. The HA frequencies F(0.295) and F(0.055) were first analyzed in study of H1N1 [41] , and F(0.236) and F(0.258) of HA were calculated in [42] . Although only the top two IS frequencies were selected in Table II , the actual top three HA frequencies of pandemic 2009 human H1N1 were F(0.295), F(0.055), and F(0.258) in USA, and F(0.295), F(0.258), and F(0.055) in Europe and Asia, while the swine H1N1 in USA had F(0.295) and F(0.055) as its top two frequencies, showing the HA binding of pandemic 2009 H1N1 was similar to that of North American swine H1N1 [9] , [10] . Eurasian swine H1N1 HA binding patterns [F(0.295) and F(0.281)] were all avian like because F(0.281) was their secondary binding frequency. The avian like swine viruses emerged in Europe in the late 1970s after an avian virus was introduced to swine [19] . Seasonal human H1N1 in USA, Europe, and Asia all had the same top two HA IS frequencies F(0.055) and F(0.236) and the same NA frequencies F(0.373) and F(0.268).",

The advantage of our work here was able to show the changing patterns of HA and NA and their correlation, if any, over a period of several years. We could see that the primary and secondary HA IS at F(0.055) and F(0.236) of seasonal H1N1 in USA remained at the same level (the top two ISs of NA kept a constant gap), but after 2007 HA IS at F(0.055) played a clear leading role (the leading role of NA IS at F(0.373) started to diminish). Also there was a fluctuation of the top two HA ISs from 2008 to 2009, but their gap remained a constant during these two years (the top two ISs of NA started to reduce their gap). In contrast, the top two ISs of HA and NA of swine H1N1 in USA kept mixing with no clear leader during the whole period of 1930-2013.

To find any changing patterns of HA binding specificity, some leading HA IS frequencies of pandemic 2009 human H1N1 in different regions were presented (Fig. 2) . We did not plot the HA IS at F(0.258) in this section because it remained relatively stable from 2009 to 2013 compared to that at other top frequencies, even though it was one of the top frequencies of this virus. There were noticeable number of HA or NA sequences in 2009 that did not have the month and day information, so they were placed in the beginning of 2009 in our plot. Nonetheless, in any case, the HA and NA from the same virus isolate were placed at the same position of the plot to visualize any possible correlation between these two proteins over time.",

As in the case of American seasonal H1N1, there seemed a trend, i.e., the primary HA IS went higher where the primary NA IS was lower. There was a clear drop of the HA ISs in 2012, with the drop in USA being the largest. These HA ISs then started to increase, which occurred for American HA ISs in July of 2012 (Fig. 2) . Minus this drop, the primary HA IS kept stable. However, the HA ISs at F(0.055) and F(0.281) were on the steady rise from 2009 to 2013 with a sharp increase in 2013 for American strains. Accompanying this HA IS increase was rise of the NA ISs at F(0.346) and F(0.277) in USA, Europe, and Asia. F(0.281) was the primary HA IS frequency of American avian H1N1 (Fig. 1) .

Both NA ISs at F(0.346) and F(0.277) of pandemic 2009 H1N1 were in a quick decrease in 2013 while its NA ISs at F(0.346) and F(0.277) were on a rise.",

The association of the changing patterns of HA and NA observed here called for an experimental approach to elucidate further their functional interdependence.

A/California/7/2009 was selected because it was one of the strains used in the composition for the Northern Hemisphere 2013-2014 influenza vaccine (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/vaccineselection.htm), and A/Texas/36/2013 was chosen because it was collected on November 18, 2013, just before the human deaths caused by this virus in Texas in December, 3013. The alterations of their IS resulting from the slow variations in HA and NA were shown (Fig. 3) . The HA IS of A/Texas/36/2013 at F(0.281) was increased to the third, and at the same time the NA ISs of A/Texas/36/2013 at F(0.277) and F(0.346) became the first and second respectively, compared to A/California/07/ 2009. The ISs of HA and NA from these two strains in Fig. 3 captured the status of the two ends well.",

The top 25 entropy positions of each year highlighted the slow shift of the genetic makeup of HA and NA of this virus. HA mutations S183P and S185T were found to increase the receptor binding avidity of HA, whereas A134T and A197T decreased that of HA [44] . Other mutations in HA that might increase the disease severity of this virus were reported in [45] . Our entropy analysis detailed the potential change of the amino acids at these positions from year to year, say, the entropy of HA at position 163 (Fig. 4) .",

The actual amino acids at each of these positions in 2009 and 2013 were shown (Table III ) and the impact on the IS of HA and NA at leading frequencies by these amino acid substitutions was also presented (Table IV), which assessed the   TABLE III  IMPORTANT AMINO HA mutations D222G or D222E in the receptor binding site of pandemic 2009 H1N1 HA were found sporadically, and D222G was correlated with cases of severe or fatal disease and its changed the HA binding preference [48] . When D222G was applied to an early strain of pandemic 2009 H1N1, A/California/04/09, it showed a modest reduction in the binding avidity to receptors and an increase in the binding to receptors in comparison with wild-type virus [49] . Therefore, D222G acquired dual receptor specificity for and receptors, which implied more efficiency in human transmission and enhanced ability to infect human lungs and might help explain why some patients that contracted it also developed more serious lung infections.",

Our initial plan was to examine the HA and NA sequences of pandemic 2009 H1N1 in USA to find the causes for the Texas cases.

Our time series analysis showed that the HA binding preference of this virus has been the characteristic of swine H1N1 virus since 2009; however, its characteristic of seasonal human H1N1 and its binding to avian type receptors both were on steady rise and had an increase in 2013 with American strains having the sharpest surge. The first change could improve the viral transmission and replication in humans and the second could enhance its ability to cause infection deep in lungs, which might contribute to the increased virulence of this virus in Texas. In light of the closely interacting roles of HA and NA, we further studied the NA activity of this virus to reveal the interdependence between HA and NA during the virus evolution from 2009 to 2013. Some of our findings on HA and NA were supported by experimental results. We also identified amino acid substitutions in HA and NA of the virus that were critical for the observed evolution.",
