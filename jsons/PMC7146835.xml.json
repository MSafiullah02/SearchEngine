At the same time, projections of temperature and rainfall alert us to future increases in both parameters.1 In this context, studies assessing the influence of climate and air pollution in children, particularly in relation to respiratory diseases, are necessary. A recent systematic review confirmed the association between exposure to air pollutants (particulate matter with diameters >2.5 \u03bcm [PM2.5] and >10 \u03bcm [PM10], nitrogen dioxide [NO2] and sulfur dioxide [SO2]) and the risk of hospital admission due to bronchiolitis.2 A study conducted in primary health care centres in Madrid concluded that NO2 levels (particularly those exceeding 40 \u03bcg/m3) were associated with increases in paediatric respiratory disease.3 To our knowledge, no similar studies have been done in Barcelona.",

During these years, the city showed sustained pollution levels corresponding to 1.3\u20131.5 times the recommended limits of the WHO for NO2 and particulates.4 The fact that these pollution levels were sustained over time may explain why our study did not find an association with pollutants, as opposed to the results reported in the United States, where bronchiolitis cases were associated with high values of PM10 due to the presence of steel mills and geographical areas with episodic pollution.5, 6 Although we have not detected differences in the distribution of the main pollutants between days with bronchiolitis cases and the rest of the month, it is important to underline that NO2 is the main pollutant present throughout the year in the metropolitan area of Barcelona. This pollutant has already been associated with increased paediatric respiratory disease in Madrid.3 Further studies with larger databases including recent data are needed to understand the relationship between bronchiolitis and the environment.",
