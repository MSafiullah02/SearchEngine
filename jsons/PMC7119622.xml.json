            "text": "Respiratory infection is a common problem in dogs (Mochizuki et al., 2008). The etiological agents involved in canine infectious respiratory disease are complex. Viral infectious agents include canine distemper virus (CDV), influenza virus, canine herpesvirus (CHV), canine adenovirus 2 (CAV-2), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Jeoung et al., 2013). Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma cynos are the most significant bacterial etiologic agents (Mochizuki et al., 2008, Priestnall et al., 2014). Canine distemper (CD) is a highly contagious and fatal disease in dogs caused by CDV. CDV belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. Although live attenuated vaccines have been used for many years to control distemper, CDV continues to cause outbreaks, particularly in young dogs (Demeter et al., 2010). Previous studies reported that vaccinated dogs were infected with CDV in Mexico and Japan (Simon-Martinez et al., 2008, Uema et al., 2005). It is therefore necessary to discriminate between wild type and vaccine type strains because the attenuated CDV vaccines are used worldwide. The hemagglutinin (H) gene revealed pronounced genetic diversity and was employed to detect and differentiate between different CDV strains (An et al., 2008, Si et al., 2010, Uema et al., 2005). There is no specific therapy for animals with canine distemper besides supportive treatment (Deem et al., 2000). The influenza A virus belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae. The matrix gene is highly conserved and was often used for virus detection (Fouchier et al., 2000). Influenza virus causes sustained transmission among dogs, leading to respiratory disease outbreaks, e.g. H3N8 (Crawford et al., 2005, Payungporn et al., 2008) and H3N2 (Song et al., 2009).Treatment with the antiviral medicine oseltamivir has been approved in humans, but its use in dogs still needs evaluation (Beeler, 2009). Canine herpesvirus (CHV) is a member of the Herpesviridae family. Infection in older dogs appears to be restricted to the upper respiratory tract (Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007). The CHV glycoprotein B gene is often used as the virus detection target because it is highly conserved (Decaro et al., 2010). Limited studies with antiviral agents such as vidarabine are inconclusive, but immediate recognition and treatment is essential to have any possibility of success (Creevy, June 2013). B. bronchiseptica is a major bacteria cause of kennel cough in dogs. An upstream flagellin gene sequence was employed for specific detection (Hozbor et al., 1999). Most B. bronchiseptica strains are sensitive to aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum third generation penicillin, tetracycline, quinolone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Mattoo and Cherry, 2005). Mycoplasmas cynos was demonstrated as the only mollicute found associated with canine infectious respiratory disease (Chalker et al., 2004). PCR detection was developed based on its 16S/23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS) (Chalker, 2004). Treatment with none \u03b2-lactam antibiotics such as doxycycline or tetracycline should be effective against most canine mycoplasmas (Chalker, 2005).",

Simultaneous canine vurial respiratory disease detection using multiplex PCR has been reported (Jeoung et al., 2013), but the etiogenic bacteria were not involved and the wild and vaccine types of CDVs could not be distinguished. The microarray is a promising alternative that can detect hundreds or thousands of genes in parallel. This study attempts to develop an oligonucleotide microarray system for simultaneous detection and differentiation of dog respiratory pathogens, including wild strains and vaccine strains of CDVs, influenza virus, CHV, B. bronchiseptica and M.cynos. These pathogens were chosen based on the disease fatality and the particular medicine options. The oligonucleotide microarray could provide an excellent diagnosis approach with better efficacy and efficiency to comprehensively distinguish clinically significant dog respiratory pathogens, including viruses and bacteria at the same time. The proposed device might greatly assist in disease control and therapy.",

Co-infections with multiple pathogens are also frequently seen (Chalker et al., 2004, Erles et al., 2004, Jeoung et al., 2013) which makes differential diagnosis imperative to enact correct treatment. The introduction of live attenuated CDV vaccines in the 1950s and their extensive use have drastically reduced the CD incidence in dogs. However, CD outbreaks involving virulent viruses introduced into a partly immune population have still been observed (Iwatsuki et al., 2000, Radtanakatikanon et al., 2013). Differentiation between wild type and vaccine type CDs is then necessary when performing CDV detection (Simon-Martinez et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2011). Based on the CDV H gene alignment and analysis of all CDV vaccines available in Taiwan, the CDV vaccine strains could be divided into two groups: traditional vaccine group (Onderstepoort strain, Distemperoid strain, Lederle strain and BA strain) and contemporary vaccine group (N-CDV strain, high homology to Vaccine X) (Chulakasian et al., 2010). Three canine respiratory viruses (CDV, CRCoV and influenza virus) have been reported distinguished using multiplex PCR (Jeoung et al., 2013). Four canine respiratory RNA viruses and two DNA viruses have been reported detected using multiplex RT-PCR and multiplex PCR, respectively (Piewbang et al., 2016). Wild type and traditional CDV vaccine strains could be discriminated using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (Wang et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010), and cotemporary vaccine strain was able to be distinguished using refractory mutation system-PCR amplification (Chulakasian et al., 2010). However, no comprehensively integrated approach has ever been developed. Herein, an oligonucleotide microarray system was developed to simultaneously detect and differentiate clinical canine significant respiratory pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and traditional and contemporary CDV vaccine strains. The microarray signals were easily read with the naked eye requiring no additional reader equipment. The detection limit comparison and the clinical sample test findings demonstrated that the microarray had higher efficiency and sensitivity than the multiplex PCR-agarose gel method. The microarray CDV detection limit was 10 viral copies, which was even lower than the 23.2 copies using CDV hemi-nested RT-PCR (Di Francesco et al., 2012). Although real time RT-PCR can achieve similar low detection limit for these respiratory pathogens (Aeschbacher et al., 2015, Decaro et al., 2010, Nummi et al., 2015, Tatti et al., 2011, Wilkes et al., 2014), the machine cost is high. The microarray presented in this study compared to real time RT-PCR could be a feasibly alternative and especially preferable to the local under-equipped laboratories.",

Probe CDVW2 and CDVW3 were for those in Japan, South Korea and China that CDVW1 cannot bind. However, CDVW2 and CDVW3 could not be tested in this study since these foreign strains were not available in Taiwan. Further experiments would be needed for CDVW2 and CDVW3 efficacy verification. In the microarray clinical sample tests, CDV, influenza virus, CHV and B. bronchiseptica were detected from the nasal swab samples but none of the M. cynos was captured. This might be due to the sampling method because M. cynos was only in the lower respiratory tract (Chalker et al., 2004). The detection rate of M. cynos might be higher if the samples were taken from the lower respiratory tract, e.g. bronchial-alveolar lavage. Because RNA viruses would be under constant mutation over time, the microarray efficacy might decrease if the mutations occur to the primer or probe sites. However, the microarray functionality could be extended by recruiting new probes, which would make this device more applicable for meeting future practical needs.",
