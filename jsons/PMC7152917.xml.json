In 1981, Geriatric Nursing published a classic, comprehensive overview of the assessment and treatment of speech and language disorders in older adults written by Barbara Dreher.1 \u201cOvercoming Speech and Language Disorders\u201d1 focused primarily on communication disorders resulting from stroke and laryngectomy. Several of the principles and interventions to improve communication presented in 1981 (e.g., modifying speaking and listening, maintaining quiet environment, and directions for the specific type of communication impairment) are still fundamental today in communication care for patients with stroke, and for a wide range of communication disabilities. Notably, the role of the speech language pathologist (SLP) in diagnosing and treating communication disorders was highlighted. Several communication tools such as communication boards with pictures, words, and letters and electronic voice synthesizers introduced in this article 40 years ago1 are still used for non-vocal patients in the acute care setting. We now have more advanced communication tools and nurse-led research testing the usability and efficacy of several of these tools.2\n",

Our view of communication disability expanded to include sensory impairments (i.e., poor vision or hearing) that affect receptive and expressive communication, limited English language proficiency, and poor health literacy. Similarly, attention to conditions beyond stroke that are associated with impaired communication include a host of neurocognitive (dementia) and neuromuscular (Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) disorders as well as situational conditions in acute and chronic critical illness (mechanical ventilation) that prevent vocal communication.",

For example, although many nurses rely on lip-reading to communicate with non-vocal patients, this technique requires formal training and is prone to misinterpretation.7 Nurses often assume that family members can interpret a patient's communication attempts during acute/critical illness, but family members report frustration and an inability to accurately interpret the patient's non-vocal messages.8 Communication impairment can affect symptom recognition by nurses and accurate pain assessment, in particular, can be problematic when patients have communication difficulty.9\n,\n10\n",

A hospital chaplain developed and tested a novel spiritual care picture communication board, to support chaplain communication with non-vocal patients, showing an association between chaplain-led picture-guided spiritual care and reductions in anxiety and stress during and after an ICU admission. 12 Many older adults prefer low tech AAC tools, but are still able and interested in using electronic tablet communication applications for medical encounters with appropriate demonstration and instruction.13 These studies and initiatives also highlight and extend the role of the speech language pathologist in providing instruction, consultation and support for complex communication needs of acute and critically ill older adults.14\n,\n15\n",

Moreover, most interprofessional teams are not trained in communication assessment and the use of assistive tools and techniques tailored to an individual patient's abilities and preferences. We hope that, in response to the enormous influx of older patients who need assistive communication during this pandemic, nurses and other members of the interprofessional team will access the free tools and training.
