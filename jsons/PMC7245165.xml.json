Immigration status is a primary barrier to help-seeking, as its widespread impact includes cultural barriers such as lack of language proficiency and different values, structural barriers such as low income and education, and institutional barriers such as legal systems and law enforcement structures that are difficult to navigate (Reina and Lohman 2015; Silva-Mart\u00ednez 2017). Underneath these issues, IL report fear, unfamiliarity, and a lack of trust and knowledge regarding utilizing formal systems (Zadnik et al. 2016). Many IL do not have equitable access to legal protection, social services, and domestic violence shelters because of limited English-speaking ability or few informal support systems (e.g., family and friends) in the U.S. and isolation. As a result, IL are less likely to seek help from formal institutions than Latina women with residency status (Zadnik et al. 2016).",

IL seeking informal support systems (e.g., trusted friends or family) after IPV experience benefits such as peer support, access to information about traits and characteristics of IPV, and services available through the criminal justice system (Reina et al. 2013; Zadnik et al. 2016). For those women who seek help from formal systems, it is necessary to create culturally specific prevention and intervention group-format programs to effectively support this population. Incorporating cultural values and improving educational initiatives to raise awareness of available services and legal rights are two critical avenues toward increasing equitable access to help for IL (Reina and Lohman 2015; Zadnik et al. 2016).",

Findings across studies indicated that IL are a sub-group who are in particular need of responsive prevention programs because of the limited equitable access to services and programs among the general population of Latinas and implications related to lacking legal immigration status (Alvarez et al. 2016; Gonz\u00e1lez-Guarda et al. 2013; Page et al. 2017).",

Given population increases among immigrant Latino families in the U.S. and the unique circumstances of IL compared to U.S.-born Latinas (i.e., limited English proficiency, legal status, reduced natural supports; Bhuyan and Velagapudi 2013; Gonzalez-Guarda et al. 2013), we chose to focus on models developed uniquely for IL. We included a variety of group models, such as therapy groups, support groups, psycho-education groups, and workshops. We included articles that employed quantitative, qualitative, program evaluation, and mixed methodologies. In addition, we considered studies that were published within the past 25 years. We were interested in recent investigations of intervention or prevention programs for IL living in the U.S. because of the increase of the Latino population within a 25-year time period.",

Workshop interventions focused on training and empowering groups of IL health promotoras to address health concerns in their communities (Bonilla et al. 2012; Serrata et al. 2016). Those that utilized therapy groups tended to focus on helping participants manage symptoms of mental health disorders (Kaltman et al. 2016).

Many groups focused on social support, such as sharing of personal stories with group peers and encouraging the exchange of contact information among group members, to mitigate the social isolation accompanying immigrant status and IPV (Breton 2000; Molina et al. 2009). Several groups incorporated cultural considerations into the intervention, such as familism, machismo, immigration issues, religiosity, and group discussions on the impact that these and other cultural concepts had on intimate relationships (Marrs Fuchsel et al. 2016; Nicolaidis et al. 2013; Perilla et al. 2012; Rayle et al. 2006).

There was variance among the reviewed articles in employment of one or a combination of theoretical frameworks to underpin group interventions. Among the most commonly cited theoretical approaches to group interventions with IL were empowerment theory, feminist theory, ecological theory, and cognitive-behavioral theory. Empowerment theory (cited in: Marrs Fuchsel et al. 2016; Nicolaidis et al. 2013; Serrata et al. 2016), asserts that increased awareness of personal factors related to one\u2019s ability to make change leads to mastery over issues of concern to them (Zimmerman 1995). Feminist theory (cited in: Nicolaidis et al. 2013; Perilla et al. 2012) perceives individual-level power discrepancies between males and females as directly connected to oppressive patriarchal forces at the political level (Millett 1970). Ecological theory (cited in: Bonilla et al. 2012; Perilla et al. 2012), considers individual-level phenomena as nested interactionally within community- and societal-level systems (Bronfenbrenner 1977; Carlson 1984). Cognitive-behavioral theory (cited in: Kaltman et al. 2016; Nicolaidis et al. 2013; Rayle et al. 2006) posits that altering phenomena on cognitive and behavioral domains leads to emotional relief from a wide range of mental health disorders (Beck 1979, 2011).",

The mutual aid approach to group work (cited in: Molina et al. 2009) helps participants focus on one another\u2019s strengths and engage in receiving and offering support to work through problems (Steinberg 2004). The structural approach to social work practice (cited in: Breton, 2000) understands personal problems as resulting from unequally distributed opportunities and resources in society (Wood and Middleman 1992).",

Nearly all interventions reviewed in this paper reported support by one or more theoretical frameworks, as well as the variety of approaches used, is noteworthy. It appears that some approaches have logical connection to the field, type, and aim of specific interventions. For example, a cognitive-behavioral approach was used with a depression program (Kaltman et al. 2016) and an empowerment approach was used in a program designed to improve participants\u2019 sense of empowerment (Serrata et al. 2016). Approaches such as empowerment theory, intersectionality, feminist theory, structural theory, and existentialism all serve to acknowledge the unique needs and experiences of IL (personal power, choices, culture, and marginalization) through overlapping yet distinct lenses. Still other approaches are logical assets to group work, such as the mutual aid approach. This finding suggests that a variety of theoretical frameworks can be appropriately utilized to anchor group interventions with IL. Lastly, despite the fact that only 10 group-format programs were identified, with small sample sizes averaging 5\u20138 participants per group, in different types of group formats (e.g., psycho-educational groups), professionals can provide direct practice services (i.e., groups) capable of reaching larger numbers of IL experiencing IPV. In addition, community-based agencies can reduce costs for IL needing services by offering groups in addition to offering one-on-one services (e.g., individual counseling).",

Though the diversity of evaluation methods, practice settings, constructs measured, intervention goals, small sample sizes, and geographic locations precluded our ability to draw generalizable conclusions for practice implications of the effectiveness finding, the interventions shared a common aim of IPV prevention through the use of group work for this population. The universal effectiveness finding among the reviewed studies suggests that appropriate implementation of reviewed programs (i.e., replicating factors such as setting, sample, facilitator, evaluation methods) should be undertaken, coupled with rigorous program evaluation methods given the early stage of this specific field of research. To date, we are aware of one group-format intervention (e.g., psycho-educational group) identified in this study (Marrs Fuchsel et al. 2016) that has been evaluated and replicated with 12 groups (n = 93) addressing IPV among IL (Marrs Fuchsel 2017). Further practice research is needed to generate conclusions as to intervention generalizability, as well as to continue to make accessible these important supports for immigrant Latinas facing IPV. Given that most intervention studies reviewed in this paper discussed the need for further research to determine generalizability of such interventions, we conclude that reasonable implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of these programs in similar practice settings by qualified professionals is needed.",

Community health care professionals working in community-based health care clinics serving large groups of IL might conduct a needs assessment to determine what additional types of group-format interventions are needed as they provide medical care.

Despite the fact that community-based agencies can be prepared to provide diverse direct services such as group-format interventions in addition to one-on-one interventions, difficulties in direct service provisions might occur. Structural and systemic barriers in community-based agencies, such as limited numbers of Spanish-English bilingual professionals available, lack of knowledge about current group interventions, few training opportunities for bilingual professionals, and lack of funding might deter implementation of groups for this vulnerable population (Rayle et al. 2006). When considering implementation of an intervention reviewed in this paper, we, as well as the authors of these interventions, encourage evaluating similarity of setting, facilitator, and sample population as well as effective program evaluation measures given the dearth of literature in this field. Effective value-laden leadership in community-based agencies that can promote the benefits of group-format interventions for IL and establishing board members and development directors that can raise funds to provide group-format interventions is needed. Finally, adding employment opportunities for bilingual Spanish-English professionals in community-based agencies and implementing outreach and program awareness campaigns in communities about group interventions and services would be important. By doing so, IL will receive services in both languages.",

By highlighting the group interventions and programs that are conducted in community-based agencies, mental health and other professionals will understand and use the specific group intervention most needed in working with IL experiencing incidences of IPV. Indicative of current research, psycho-educational groups provide information on specific topics, access to resources, and peer support: participants learn, become empowered, and want to make personal and relationship changes (Marrs Fuchsel 2017). Furthermore, the qualitative analysis conducted during the review of the identified articles added to in-depth and rich data regarding each type of group-format program. We relied on qualitative peer-reviewed journal articles in specific databases with specific criteria to answer the research question. A final strength of the present review is its particular focus on IL and studies that address the compounding challenges of immigrant status in the context of IPV.",

The studies reviewed included 10 articles that are largely small in terms of sample size and diverse in terms of intervention characteristics. This systematic review may not be exhaustive due to lack of a grey literature search and a larger timeframe. Second, we did not utilize an outside observer to confirm our data analysis of codes. The study quality was not formally assessed with specific tools, given the disparate methods utilized in the studies. We did not undertake structured analysis of other study quality characteristics because intervention results/efficacy was not the principal reporting purpose of this review. We find that this suggestion could point to avenues for future research in this field. Finally, this review may have been limited in its ability to present information about programs that are currently running and may not be exhaustive in its report.",

By doing so, researchers might detect a broader scope of intervention programs with successful group-format interventions addressing IPV and Latinas in general. Future research could employ a smaller timeframe to capture more recent and current interventions and utilize grey literature to include those programs not represented in the academic literature. Another study might include conducting a national survey of program directors of identified community-based agencies who are conducting group-format intervention and prevention programs among this population. Findings have implications for mental health professionals and professionals who work with IL experiencing incidences of IPV. Although community-based agencies and shelters are available that may provide IPV group-format interventions, often IL cannot access these services. Therefore, by using group-format interventions in community-based agencies, IL may be more exposed to these types of programs and services and may feel empowered to change their lives.",

Group facilitators can use group interventions in addition to individual interventions to strengthen their direct practice setting. Finally, educators from various professionals and disciplines (e.g., social work, psychology, marriage and family therapy, counseling) and who teach about direct practice interventions (i.e., group or individual interventions) can use the findings of this study to teach students about group-format intervention and prevention programs for use among IL who are affected by IPV. Education around group work with IL experiencing IPV should include information reflected in the findings presented in this paper to promote research-informed practice. This includes teaching students about the importance of social support in group work with IL, collaborating with community-based agencies, addressing culturally relevant topics for IL as distinct from Latina populations (e.g., legal complexities of immigration and IPV), and using curricula and theoretical frameworks to guide group interventions. Students can gain knowledge on best-practices regarding the type of group, focus, and methods for meeting the distinct needs of IL.",
