            "text": "Increasing evidence demonstrates that excessive intake of fat is related to the risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among humans and animals [1]. NAFLD is a stress-associated hepatic injury and metabolic disorder featured by diffuse hepatic steatosis and triglyceride accumulation, leading to simple fatty liver, steatohepatitis, and even cirrhosis [2]. The occurrence and progression of NAFLD can be linked to some essential factors, such as lipid deposition, inflammatory factors and oxidative stress [3]. During the past decade, accumulating studies have validated a critical role of innate immunity in the progression of hepatic steatosis [4]. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), also known as Transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173), is a signaling molecule, and its activation induces powerful type I interferon (IFN) immunity [5]. In response to viral infection, aberrant double-stranded DNA presents in cytosol and stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase to produce cGAMP. The latter activates STING and then recruits STING to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), activating the down-streaming signals including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to subsequently promote the expression of type I IFN genes [6,7]. The importance of TBK1 activation regulated by STING signaling due to metabolic stresses has been reported during NAFLD progression [8]. Given the importance of STING in inflammatory response and NAFLD, we supposed that it might be a potential therapeutic target for developing effective treatments against NAFLD.",

Orlistat (ORL) is used as a weight-loss agent because it induces fat malabsorption, and a randomized controlled trial reported that ORL improved hepatic steatosis in obese NAFLD patients. Therefore, ORL was used as a positive control in our study. We found that RDV supplementation could effectively ameliorate HFD-induced metabolic disorder and insulin resistance in mice. Hepatic lipid deposition and inflammatory response in HFD-fed mice were also markedly alleviated by RDV. Both in vivo and in vitro analysis showed that RDV-alleviated NAFLD was tightly associated with the suppression of STING signaling, which contributed to novel strategies for the NAFLD management.",

RDV and ORL were administered by gavage every day for 16 weeks. All the dosages were determined according to previous studies [10,13], and the control mice were treated with an equal volume of saline. The body weight of mice and total energy intake were measured, and the later one was regarded to the energy of different feeds after the animal experiment. At the end of the experiment, all animals were euthanized. Blood was harvested for biochemical investigation. Fat tissue (epididymal, subcutaneous, visceral, interscapular) was weighed. The liver tissue samples were harvested for further analysis.",

In addition, TG, TC and LDL-C contents in serum of mice were markedly up-regulated by HFD compared with the Con group, and these effects were significantly reversed by RDV supplement. Opposite result was detected in the change of serum HDL-C (Fig. 2D and E). Consistently, RDV treatment markedly reduced liver TG, TC and NEFA contents in HFD-challenged mice (Fig. 2F). Histological calculation demonstrated that HFD obviously caused lipid accumulation in hepatic sections, while being evidently attenuated due to RDV supplementation, accompanied by the markedly reduced inflammation score, ballooning score and steatosis score (Fig. 2G and H). To better understand the molecular mechanism of RDV on lipid deposition, fatty acid metabolism-associated signals were evaluated. RT-qPCR and/or western blot results showed that HFD-induced dyslipidemia in liver of mice was markedly reversed by RDV treatment, as evidenced by the significantly reduced genes associated with fatty acid synthesis (HMGCR, SREBF1, FASN, SCD1 and PPAR\u03b3) and fatty acid uptake (CD36, SLC27A1 and FABP1), and the improved expression of molecules related to fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (PPAR\u03b1, CPT1\u03b1 and ACOX1) (Fig. 2I and J).

Notably, these inflammatory effects triggered by HFD were abrogated due to RDV supplementation (Fig. 3\nA and B). F4/80, as a critical macrophage marker regulating inflammation, was found to be clearly up-regulated by HFD, whereas being obviously reduced by RDV (Fig. 3C). We then found that the mRNA and protein expressions of STING were higher in liver of HFD-fed mice than in control mice, which were significantly decreased in mice co-treated with RDV. Furthermore, the levels of phospho-TBK1, phospho-IRF3 and IFN-\u03b2 were higher in HFD mice than that of the control group, indicating that the STING/IRF3 signaling was activated, along with markedly up-regulated expression of phospho-NF-\u03baB.

We first knocked down STING in hepatocytes using its specific siRNA sequence (Fig. 4\nA). Oil Red O staining validated the role of RDV in reducing lipid deposition in hepatocytes induced by PA, which was similar with the results caused by siSTING. These findings were accompanied by the decreased expression of SREBF1, FASN, SCD1 and CD36, and the increased PPAR\u03b1, CPT1\u03b1 and ACOX1 (Fig. 4B and C). Moreover, both RDV and siSTING reduced the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine in PA-stimulated hepatocytes (Fig. 4D). Consistently, the protein expression levels of phospho-TBK1, phospho-IRF3, IFN-\u03b2 and phospho-NF-\u03baB promoted by PA were markedly abolished by RDV and STING knockdown (Fig. 4E). Then, we over-expressed STING in the isolated hepatocytes (Fig. 4F). Notably, STING over-expression promoted lipid accumulation in PA-treated hepatocytes, and RDV-attenuated dyslipidemia was markedly abrogated by STING over-expression (Fig. 4G and H). In addition, oeSTING transfection significantly promoted PA-triggered inflammatory response in hepatocytes. Meanwhile, RDV-suppressed inflammation in PA-cultured cells was highly diminished due to STING over-expression, as evidenced by the rescued expression of inflammatory factors and restored activation of TBK1, IRF3, IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB (Fig. 4I and J).

            "text": "RDV (GS-5734), a well-known broad-spectrum antiviral drug, inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and alleviates SARS-CoV mouse model [12,19]. RDV was reported to improve pulmonary function or severe lung pathology by reducing immune cell infiltration and inflammatory response [[10], [11], [12]]. STING is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane protein, and is essential in regulating innate immune signaling [6]. STING links up-streaming DNA sensors to down-streaming IRF3 and NF-\u03baB pathway activation to subsequently induce the expression of type I interferon such as IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, which leads to a potent anti-viral condition [20,21]. STING is expressed in various tissues or organs, and the STING activation could result in cell metabolic disorders in an auto-immune or auto-inflammatory disease animal model [22,23]. STING is also a trans-membrane protein, known as a key signal in the cytoplasmic DNA-TBK1-IRF3 pathway [24]. Furthermore, STING could activate the NF-\u03baB signaling through promoting TBK1 [25]. Then, the activated IRF3 and NF-\u03baB could enter the nucleus and induce the expression of IFNs and pro-inflammatory factors including IL-18, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 [26]. The synergy between IRF3 and NF-\u03baB in inflammation has been demonstrated before [27]. It has been widely demonstrated that chronic hepatic inflammation aggravates insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, further contributing to the progression of NAFLD [28]. Thus, inflammation suppression could be involved in the treatment of fatty liver. Recently, STING expression was reported to be up-regulated during NAFLD progression, which enhanced macrophage-regulated hepatic inflammation [29]. Here in our study, we confirmed that inflammatory response was involved in NAFLD development, as evidenced by the remarkably increased expression of IL-18, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and CXCL-10, which was, however, evidently reversed by RDV treatment. Therefore, RDV had anti-inflammatory effects, which were validated in PA- and LPS-incubated Kupffer and hepatocytes. In addition, RDV-ameliorated inflammation was accompanied with the suppression of STING, as well as its down-streaming signals, including the phospho-TBK1, phospho-IRF3 and IFN\u03b2. STING signal then activated NF-\u03baB, promoting increases of inflammatory factors in NAFLD. Importantly, the in vitro results demonstrated that STING over-expression could further aggravate PA-induced inflammatory response in hepatocytes. At the same time, RDV-hindered inflammation and activation of TBK1/IRF3/NF-\u03baB signaling was dramatically abrogated by STING over-expression in PA-exposed cells. All these findings demonstrated that RDV-restrained inflammation was largely dependent on STING expression.",

Meanwhile, STING over-expression diminished the protective effects of RDV on the lipid metabolism in PA-treated hepatocytes. Thus, inflammatory response regulated by STING was involved in RDV-ameliorated lipid metabolic disorders during fatty liver progression.",
