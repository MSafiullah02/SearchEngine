Transplantation of myogenic stem cells possesses great potential for long\u2010term repair of dystrophic muscle. Indeed, intramuscular injection of adult satellite cell\u2010derived myoblasts from a normal syngeneic donor into mdx mice results in the formation of dystrophin\u2010positive muscle fibers [1, 2, 3]. Furthermore, intramuscular injection of allogeneic donor muscle\u2010derived cells into chimeric cxmd canine recipients restored dystrophin expression for at least 24 weeks in the absence of post\u2010transplant immunosuppression, indicating that cell transplantation may be a viable therapeutic option for muscular dystrophy [4].",

Traditional means of expanding satellite cell\u2010derived myoblasts ex vivo result in a dramatic loss of engraftment potential [4, 5]. The success of single muscle fiber transplantation suggests that mimicking the biochemical and biophysical signaling from the fiber may be important for maintaining engraftment potential of expanded muscle satellite cells [6, 7].",

Skeletal muscle injury in mice results in increased expression of Delta\u2010like\u20101 (Dll\u20101) within the niche, and activation of Notch signaling increases the number of proliferating myogenic cells and promotes muscle regeneration after injury [13]. In vitro, overexpression of an activated form of Notch downregulates expression of MyoD and myogenin and inhibits myogenic differentiation in primary mouse myoblasts and C2C12 cells [13, 14]. The extracellular domain of Dll\u20101 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (Delta\u20101ext\u2010IgG) is sufficient for inhibition of differentiation in cultured C2C12 myoblasts; however, immobilization is required for effective signaling [15].",

To compare the engraftment efficiency of fresh fibers to freshly isolated muscle\u2010derived cells, we transplanted each population into the TA muscle of a NOD/SCID mouse, as previously described [16]. The mouse hind limb was preirradiated with 12 Gy of ionizing radiation to prevent regeneration by host mouse satellite cells and pretreated with BaCl2 to induce muscle degeneration (see Materials and Methods). On average, injection of 50,000 freshly isolated canine muscle\u2010derived cells appeared to be equivalent to injection of five single canine muscle fibers from the same donor muscle biopsy, comparing both the number of fibers expressing canine dystrophin and the number of nuclei expressing Pax7 and canine lamin A/C (Fig. 1A, 1B). Because each isolated muscle fiber might have approximately 10 mononuclear cells capable of regeneration, our results are consistent with prior studies showing that transplanting muscle fibers show the greatest per cell regeneration potential [6, 7].",

In mouse studies, physical trituration of the fibers to disrupt satellite cell\u2010fiber interactions yields cells with significantly greater engraftment potential than cells enzymatically removed from the fiber [6]. The authors hypothesize that enzymatic disruption may cleave cell surface proteins required for donor cell engraftment. However, it is also possible that time away from the fiber or niche has a negative effect on donor satellite cell engraftment. Indeed, culturing muscle\u2010derived cells on a substrate with a similar stiffness to normal skeletal muscle (12 kPa) improves donor cell engraftment, indicating that biophysical signaling is important for satellite cell stemness [18, 19].",

New evidence indicates that Notch activity also plays an important role in maintenance of the satellite cell population after injury, and that expression of Notch target genes is associated with quiescent satellite cells that express high levels of Pax7 [20, 21]. The number of myogenic cells was not significantly different between cells expanded on Delta\u20101ext\u2010IgG and cells expanded on human IgG; however, Pax7 expression was increased in canine cells expanded on Delta\u20101ext\u2010IgG.

Myf5 is not expressed during myogenic differentiation [22, 23], and Myf5 transcripts have been detected in quiescent and newly activated satellite cells [24, 25, 26, 27]. Increased expression of Myf5 indicates that induction of Notch signaling with Delta\u20101ext\u2010IgG during ex vivo culture of the canine muscle\u2010derived cells resulted in maintenance and expansion of a myogenic cell with characteristics of an early activated satellite cell.",

In contrast, promoting CXCR4 activity by inhibiting CD26/DPP\u2010IV degradation of SDF\u20101 with diprotin A enhances donor cell engraftment. Together, this suggests that CXCR4 may be a marker of donor cells that effectively participate in donor cell dependent muscle regeneration. Increased expression of CXCR4 in cells expanded on Delta\u20101ext\u2010IgG may provide part of the reason for the increase in engraftment compared to cells expanded on human IgG, indicating that diprotin A may have a potent effect on engraftment of cells expanded on Delta\u20101ext\u2010IgG.",

Similarly, immobilized Delta\u20101ext\u2010IgG inhibits differentiation of human CD34+CD38\u2010cord blood precursors and dramatically increases the number of precursors capable of repopulating NOD/SCID mice [8, 9, 11].
