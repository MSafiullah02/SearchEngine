Currently it is also not entirely clear whether parosmias are a positive sign in terms of the prognosis of post-URTI and post-traumatic olfactory loss [31.29]. Phantosmia describes the distorted perception of smells in the absence of an odor source. Most often phantosmias occur after trauma or URTI [31.24]. Stress-related phantosmias have also been reported [31.30]. Similar to parosmia, the exact explanation of the molecular modifications leading to phantosmia is yet unknown and also the site of its generation remains unclear. Phantosmias also have a tendency to disappear over the course of years.",

The relatively elaborate questionnaire of olfactory disorders (QOD ) [31.47, 31.48] was designed to asses daily life problems associated with olfactory loss and has been used in a number of studies [31.49, 31.50]. It consists of 26 items that can be divided into three domains: negative statements indicating patients suffering from olfactory impairment and distorted odorous perceptions (parosmia or phantosmia), positive statements about coping with the disorder, and statements of social desirability, for control. Another questionnaire asks about the importance of olfaction in daily life [31.51]. This questionnaire does not focus on impairments, but asks how often and in which circumstances people use their sense of smell.",

The subjects have to identify odors at supra-threshold concentrations from a list of descriptors [31.73, 31.74]. For example, subjects receive a rose odor, and they are asked whether the odor was banana, fish, rose, or coffee; such tasks are no problem for healthy people, but they are very difficult for people with smell loss. The forced-choice procedure controls the patients\u2019 response bias. The result of the test corresponds to the sum of the correctly identified items. Smell identification tests are most widely used [31.66, 31.67, 31.68, 31.69, 31.70, 31.71, 31.75]. The more odors the test contains the more reliable it is [31.76, 31.77]. Identification tests have to be adjusted to the various cultures [31.78, 31.79], simply because not all odors are known everywhere; for example, many Europeans do not know the smell of wintergreen or root beer, whereas this is well known in the United States.",

Other designs are based on logistic regression [31.83, 31.84]. Discrimination tasks mainly consist of a three-alternative forced choice technique [31.68, 31.85]. Two of the administered odors are identical, one is different. The subjects\u2019 task is to find out the different one.

In addition, stimuli are presented with a steep onset (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$<\\,{\\mathrm{20}}\\,{\\mathrm{ms}}$$\\end{document}< 20ms) in a monotonous environment such that stimulus onset synchronizes the activity of as many cortical neurons as possible.

Although there are some data available on fMRI and PET in patients with olfactory loss [31.140, 31.141, 31.142], it seems that the use of these techniques in individual patients with smell or taste disorders is difficult.",

Some authors claim viral (influenza, parainfluenza viruses type III, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and Epstein Barr) rather than bacterial infections to be responsible for olfactory disturbances [31.148, 31.149] and observed a higher incidence of dysosmias after spring and summer URTI [31.144]. Furthermore, women above 45 years of age seem to be affected at a higher percentage than men [31.10, 31.144, 31.7] \u2013 which brings up the potential olfactory protective effect of estrogens [31.150]. Nevertheless, the effect of estrogen on olfactory function remains an open debate [31.151, 31.17]. It is important to inform patients with post-URTI olfactory loss about the possibility of parosmia (see above). It tends to occur 1-3 months after the URTI, although it appears sometimes to occur directly after the URTI. The frequency of parosmia is in the range of 25 % [31.152, 31.153].",

The current explanation is that coup-contre-coup lesions or tearing of the filae olfactoriae leads to anosmia or hyposmia. Although the entity of posttraumatic olfactory loss has already been described at the end of the last century it has received little systematic attention, like most olfactory disorders [31.154]. Olfactory loss seems to correlate with the severity of the trauma [31.155, 31.156, 31.157], although several authors pointed out the fact that there is considerable individual variability in terms of the vulnerability of olfactory structures [31.157, 31.158]. The injured parts of the olfactory system are most often the filae olfactoriae which cross the cribriform plate. However, central structures such as the orbitofrontal cortex and gyrus rectus have also been found to be affected from head trauma [31.147, 31.155]. Similar to post-URTI olfactory impairment, these patients are prone to develop parosmia and phantosmia several months after the trauma. Clinical experience shows that most patients with posttraumatic olfactory disturbance realize the alteration with some latency [31.159].",

While a decreased sniff volume seems to add to the decrease in olfactory function [31.171], electrophysiological recordings in response to passive olfactory stimulation clearly established the presence of olfactory impairment in IPD [31.172, 31.173]. This olfactory deficit is so reliable that it can be used as a marker of IPD [31.170, 31.174]. In other words: If a patient with normal olfactory function presents with IPD symptoms the diagnosis should be re-investigated. Olfactory loss precedes the onset of motor symptoms by 4-6 years [31.175, 31.176, 31.177]. Olfactory loss is also observed regularly in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and at a much lower frequency/less pronounced in multiple system atrophy, Huntington\u2019s disease, and motor neuron disease [31.178].",

Parosmias tend to decrease to a bearable level after approximately one year [31.152]. However, recent work revealed that more than 50 % of the parosmias still are present after 2 years [31.210]. Over time, parosmia seems to lose its devastating effect on QoL. To summarize, the best current therapeutic attitude toward post-URTI and posttraumatic olfactory disorders is to correctly inform the patient, without taking any hope of recovery nor promising quick and complete recovery. The patients should receive satisfactory olfactory testing. Follow-up investigations give both the physician and the patient the possibility to observe improvements.",

Surgery is rarely performed to specifically treat olfactory dysfunction. However, when asked, postoperative improvement of olfactory function is reported by a majority of the patients [31.219, 31.220, 31.221]. When olfactory function is measured, a different picture emerges with 25 % of patients with preoperative hyposmia and 5 % with preoperative anosmia [31.222] (compare [31.223]). In terms of the sense of smell, nasal surgery produced the highest success rates in patients with eosinophilia and a high degree of polyposis [31.223]; in addition, higher success rates were found in women, and patients with aspirin-intolerance [31.224]. Neither age, presence of asthma, nor the number of preoperative surgical interventions had a major impact on the outcome of surgery [31.223, 31.224]. Findings of endoscopical investigations do not correlate with improvement of the sense of smell [31.225]. While beneficial in many cases, surgery may also pose a certain, albeit low risk to olfactory function [31.223, 31.226].",

Systemically administered steroids are of help in many SND patients [31.228, 31.229, 31.230, 31.231, 31.232, 31.9]. In addition to the anti-inflammatory activity it has been postulated that corticosteroids directly improve olfactory function [31.233, 31.234] by modulating the function of ORN through effects on olfactory Na, K-ATPase [31.227]. In fact, systemic steroids are often helpful even in patients without nasal obstruction due to polyps or obvious inflammatory changes [31.165, 31.231, 31.235].",

If systemic steroids improve olfactory function treatment is typically continued with locally administered steroids [31.167, 31.228, 31.230, 31.236]; however, the role of topical steroids in the treatment of SND-related olfactory loss has been questioned [31.165, 31.237, 31.238]. One reason why systemic steroids have a higher therapeutic efficacy compared to topical steroids [31.239, 31.9] may relate to the deposition of the spray in the nasal cavity with only few droplets reaching the olfactory cleft [31.238, 31.240]. In fact, it has been shown that only a small amount of nasally applied drugs reaches the olfactory epithelium which is situated in an effectively protected area of the nasal cavity [31.241, 31.242, 31.243]. This situation can be remedied by the use of longer applicators [31.244], which allow to reach further into the nasal cavity so that the spray can reach the olfactory epithelium more effectively.",

One of them is alpha-lipoic acid (ALA ) which is used in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy [31.258]. The effect of ALA is well described both in experimental animals and in humans (for review see [31.259]). It is known to stimulate the expression of nerve growth factor, substance P, and neuropeptide Y [31.260, 31.261]. It enhances motor nerve conduction velocity as well as microcirculation [31.262]. Further, ALA also has neuroprotective capabilities [31.263]. Preliminary work indicated that it may be useful in post-URTI olfactory loss [31.264]. Other encouraging pilot studies have been performed with the NMDA-antagonist caroverine (NMDA: N-methyl-d-aspartate) [31.265]. Potential mechanisms for the hypothesized effect included both reduced feedback inhibition in the OLB as a consequence of NMDA-antagonistic actions or antagonism of an excitotoxic action of glutamate.",

A number of studies, from different laboratories [31.283, 31.284, 31.285], one of them performed in a blinded way [31.286], indicate that patients training with odors experience a significant improvement in olfactory function over patients who do not perform such a training.
