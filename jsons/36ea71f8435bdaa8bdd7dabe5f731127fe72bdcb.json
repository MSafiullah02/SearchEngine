Currently, thirty-two (33%) patients do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized and 8 (8%) were decannulated. Forty (41%) patients remain on full ventilator support, while 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation. Seven (7%) died as result of respiratory and multiorgan failure. Tracheostomy related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients). None of health care providers have developed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19.",

[4] [5] [6] Based on the previous experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation or performing tracheostomy were considered high-risk procedures for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers. 7 The American Academy of Otolaryngology and the Ears, Nose, Throat Surgery in the United Kingdom, have stated providers should \"avoid tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients\" due to the risks to healthcare providers. These guidelines, based on limited evidence, recommend that tracheostomies should not be performed before 2-3 weeks after intubation, preferably after negative COVID-19 testing 8, 9 and recommend open tracheostomy placement in these circumstances as opposed to percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT). An earlier tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients has potential advantages, therefore we developed a novel modification of the standard PDT procedure, designed to improve visualization and ventilation while minimizing the risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare providers. In this paper, we describe the technical aspects of the procedure, detail early patient outcomes and evaluate the early safety of our technique to our healthcare providers.",

The patient was placed supine with a shoulder roll in standard position for a percutaneous tracheostomy. Sedation and paralytics were given prior to the procedure ( Figure   1a and protocol available in the supplemental appendix) 5 An anterior neck ultrasound/doppler was performed with a linear probe to identify anatomical landmarks, vascular structures, and to mark the site of insertion between the first and second tracheal rings. Maximal oxygenation was performed prior to the procedure. The endotracheal tube (ETT) was freed from the holder, and the bronchoscope was inserted adjacent to the ETT and advanced to the level of the vocal cords ( Figure 1b) . The bronchoscope was advanced past the vocal cords, anterior to the ETT (Figure 1c ). With the ventilator on standby mode, we deflated the ETT cuff and advanced the ETT further into the distal trachea.",

This is a major benefit for patients with COVID-19. Due to improved comfort, heavy sedation can be weaned in patients with tracheostomy, 5 which has the added benefit of decreased use of paralytic agents and sedatives that were required in over 56% of these patients. Additionally, patients with a tracheostomy undergoing ventilator support weaning are more easily able to participate in respiratory therapy, physical therapy, and sit in a chair, contributing to faster recovery. While there was an 7% mortality rate, this early mortality report is significantly lower that the 50% to 67% reported in the literature on COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical respiratory support.

Additionally, this study is the first description demonstrating how to perform a PDT that mitigates the aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 during the procedure. Most importantly, the early outcomes reported supports that tracheostomies are beneficial for these patients and that PDT can be safely performed with low healthcare worker exposure to the virus. There are several flaws including the short duration of this initial report, with only early outcomes being available with an average follow-up of 18 days after starting mechanical ventilation. Also, not all health care workers providers involved in both in the procedure and the post procedure care have been tested by rtPCR or SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and certain percent of COVID-19 infected people are asymptomatic; however, it is impossible to determine the value of a positive test, as daily testing was not feasible and the continuous high level of exposure during the five weeks of providing critically care to COVID-19 patients outside of the PDT procedures.",
