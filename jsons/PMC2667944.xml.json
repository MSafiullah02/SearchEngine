In the kidney, it is predominantly expressed in the proximal tubular brush border (Tikellis et al. 2003; Hamming et al. 2004), where ACE is also present (Sibony et al. 1993). It has also been shown in distal tubules and to a much lesser extent in glomeruli (Ye et al. 2004; Gembardt et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005). In the heart, ACE2 is localized to the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of intra\u2010myocardial vessels, as well as on cardiac myocytes (Donoghue et al. 2000; Tipnis et al. 2000; Burrell et al. 2005). The enzyme has also been found in the thoracic aorta, carotid arteries, and veins (Igase et al. 2005; Sluimer et al. 2008). Since its discovery in 2000, accumulating evidence has indicated that ACE2 plays a significant role in the regulation of BP, renal and cardiac functions, and its altered expression is associated with major cardiac and renal pathophysiologies.",

Indeed, patients with hypertension showed marked ACE up\u2010regulation and ACE2 down\u2010regulation in both heart and kidney (Wakahara et al. 2007; Koka et al. 2008). ACE2 levels have been reported in the kidneys of three hypertensive rat strains (Crackower et al. 2002). In salt\u2010sensitive Sabra hypertensive (SBH/y) rats, ACE2 mRNA and protein expression are lower than that in salt\u2010resistant Sabra normotensive (SBN/y) rats. Following salt loading, an additional increase in BP was observed in SBH/y rats, which was correlated with a further decrease in ACE2 expression. In addition, a significant decrease of ACE2 expression was also observed in the kidneys of both spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and spontaneously hypertensive\u2010stroke prone rats as compared with their Wistar\u2010Kyoto (WKY) controls. Similar observations were made by Zhong et al. showing that SHR have lower cardiac and renal ACE2 mRNA and protein (Zhong et al. 2004). Chronic all\u2010trans retinoic acid treatment increases gene and protein expression of ACE2 in both heart and kidney, resulting in the reduction of BP and the attenuation of myocardial damage in SHR (Zhong et al. 2004). Treatments with ACE inhibitors or AT1R blockers increased cardiac and renal ACE2 expression and/or activity and decreased BP in Lew.Tg (mRen2) congenic hypertensive rats (Jessup et al. 2006). Over\u2010expression of ACE2 in vascular smooth muscle using the SM22 promoter reduced BP in spontaneously hypertensive\u2010stroke prone rats, and attenuated the pressor response to Ang\u2010II in these animals (Rentzsch et al. 2008). Altogether, these studies suggest an important role for ACE2 in the regulation of BP.",

The cardiac phenotype was completely rescued by genetic ablation of ACE in ACE2 knockout (ACE2\u2212/y) mice (Crackower et al. 2002), suggesting that cardiac function is modulated by the balance between ACE and ACE2. Although these cardiac abnormalities failed to be detected by Yamamoto et al. in their own ACE2\u2212/y mouse, the authors reported the development of cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation associated with reduced cardiac contractility in response to chronic pressure overload, induced by transverse aortic constriction (Yamamoto et al. 2006). These authors also observed increased cardiac Ang\u2010II levels and that inhibition of the AT1R attenuated the hypertrophic response. Recently, Oudit et al. showed that loss of ACE2 leads to a progressive age\u2010dependent dilated cardiomyopathy, associated with increased Ang\u2010II\u2010mediated oxidative stress (Oudit et al. 2007). Using similarly engineered mice, Gurley et al. failed to see a cardiac phenotype but observed a small elevation of baseline BP in knockout C57Bl/6 mice, no changes in ACE2\u2212/y with a 129/SvEv background and variable changes in mixed animals (Gurley et al. 2006; Gurley and Coffman 2008), suggesting that the role of ACE2 could be modulated by genetic factors. In addition, deletion of the ACE2 gene in male mice leads to Ang\u2010II\u2010dependent development of glomerular mesangial expansion (Oudit et al. 2006). Altogether, these findings suggest an important role for ACE2 in counteracting the effects of accumulating Ang\u2010II. However, transgenic mice with ACE2 expression targeted to myocardial cells developed spontaneous episodes of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation leading to a fatal outcome (Donoghue et al. 2003), suggesting that ACE2 possibly influences the electrical pathways of the heart.",

Increased ACE2 was also observed in cardiac tissue of patients with ischemic heart failure (Zisman et al. 2003). Moreover, blocking the effects of Ang\u2010II by ACE inhibitors or AT1R blockers increased cardiac ACE2 expression in myocardial infarcted animals (Ishiyama et al. 2004; Ferrario et al. 2005c; Karram et al. 2005; Ocaranza et al. 2006; Burchill et al. 2008), suggesting that ACE2 contribute to the cardio\u2010protective effects of ACE inhibitors and AT1R antagonists.

Chronic blockade of ACE2 in streptozotocin\u2010treated mice increased albuminuria and worsened glomerular injury, which was associated with enhanced ACE expression in both glomeruli and vasculature (Soler et al. 2007). Inhibition of ACE2 in db/db mice also increased albuminuria and glomerular deposition of fibronectin (Ye et al. 2006). In line with the beneficial effects of RAS blockade on cardiac ACE2, treatment with ACE inhibitors or AT1R blockers increased renal ACE2 levels and/or activity and reduced renal damage (Tikellis et al. 2003; Ferrario et al. 2005b; Jessup et al. 2006).",

            "text": "The distribution of ACE2 in the brain was at first controversial as original reports failed to identify the carboxypeptidase in the CNS (Donoghue et al. 2000; Tipnis et al. 2000). Later, low levels of ACE2 mRNA were shown in the human brain using quantitative real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (Harmer et al. 2002), while immunohistochemistry showed that ACE2 protein expression was restricted to endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells (Hamming et al. 2004). In addition, studies performed in brain primary cell cultures reported that ACE2 was expressed predominantly in glial cells (Gallagher et al. 2006), although this observation could be dependent on the culture conditions and the difficulty of maintaining live neurons in such cultures. SARS\u2010CoV has been detected in brains of infected patients, almost exclusively in neurons, suggesting the distribution of ACE2 to the CNS (Ding et al. 2004; Gu et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2005). Indeed, we recently demonstrated the presence of the ACE2 protein and mRNA in the mouse brain, predominantly in neurons (Doobay et al. 2007). Using a selective antibody, we found that ACE2 is widespread throughout the brain, present in nuclei involved in the central regulation of cardiovascular function like the cardio\u2010respiratory neurons of the brainstem, as well as in non\u2010cardiovascular areas such as the motor cortex and raphe (Doobay et al. 2007). Our observation was later confirmed by Lin et al. showing the presence of ACE2 mRNA and protein in the mouse brainstem (Lin et al. 2008). While these findings suggest that ACE2 is a new component of the brain RAS, they also imply that the involvement of ACE2 in the CNS is beyond the regulation of cardiovascular function.",

In normotensive models, Ang\u2010II acting on brain AT1R (Fink et al. 1987; Gutkind et al. 1988) induces an increase in BP mediated by enhanced sympathetic outflow (Falcon et al. 1978; Blume et al. 1999), vasopressin release (Unger et al. 1981) and cardiac baroreflex resetting (McDonald et al. 1980) (Table 1). In SHR, up\u2010regulation of brain RAS components (AGT, Ang\u2010II, ACE and AT1R) precedes and sustains the development of hypertension (McDonald et al. 1980; Okuno et al. 1983; Hermann et al. 1984; Casto and Phillips 1986; Gutkind et al. 1988; Tamura et al. 1996).

While the physiological role of central ACE2 is just beginning to be addressed, there is considerable evidence for a role of Ang\u2010(1\u20137) in the brain. This peptide is mainly present in central nuclei related to BP regulation, such as brainstem areas and hypothalamus (Chappell et al. 1989), and exerts synergistic or opposite effects to Ang\u2010II (Moriguchi et al. 1995; Santos et al. 2000; Gironacci et al. 2004; Becker et al. 2005). Ang\u2010(1\u20137) has been shown to act as an important neuromodulator of cardiac baroreflex mechanisms, leading to an increased sensitivity of this system (Campagnole\u2010Santos et al. 1992; Santos et al. 2003). In addition, central Ang\u2010(1\u20137) prevents norepinephrine release (Gironacci et al. 2004) and induces depressor responses (Moriguchi et al. 1995; Dobruch et al. 2003; H\u00f6cht et al. 2008) in hypertensive rats, increases bradykinin levels (Lu et al. 2008), potentiates the hypotensive effects of bradykinin (Bomtempo et al. 1998) and increases vasopressin (Moriguchi et al. 1994) and nitric oxide (NO) release (Gironacci et al. 2000). These effects are mediated by Mas (Gironacci et al. 2004; H\u00f6cht et al. 2008) which has been identified as the first Ang\u2010(1\u20137) binding site (Santos et al. 2003). The brain was also the first organ in which this receptor was found to be highly expressed (Young et al. 1988). Moreover, Becker et al. recently showed the presence of Mas in cardiovascular and hydroelectrolytic control areas of the rat brain supporting the role of the Ang\u2010(1\u20137) receptor in these processes (Becker et al. 2007).",

Using SELDI\u2010TOF Mass Spectrometry, Elased et al. reported that the mouse brain is the seat of high ACE2 activity while ACE activity appears to be low in the CNS (Elased et al. 2008). Although these data indicate that central ACE2 is active and plays a predominant role in the processing of Ang\u2010II into Ang\u2010(1\u20137) in the brain, they are also challenging the importance of ACE in the CNS. Surprisingly, the authors suggested that central ACE2 is more important than ACE activity in normal conditions while it may be otherwise in pathological situations. This is in disagreement with previous observations showing that the physiological importance of central Ang\u2010(1\u20137) is unveiled in pathological conditions and that its role is limited in normal situations (Dobruch et al. 2003). Moreover, in humans, the expression of ACE2 mRNA was reported to be at least 10\u2010fold lower than ACE in the brain (Harmer et al. 2002). Although it is possible that mRNA levels do not correlate with ACE2 activity, validation of the SELDI\u2010TOF Mass Spectrometry technique with current methodologies is needed. Finally, the authors\u2019 report that ACE2 activity was restricted to the murine hypothalamus is conflicting with our own observations showing widespread distribution of this carboxypeptidase throughout the mouse CNS (Doobay et al. 2007) and their recent report of ACE2 expression in the brainstem (Lin et al. 2008).",

Using transgenic mice over\u2010expressing the rat AT1a receptor selectively in the brain (NSE\u2010AT1a mouse) (Lazartigues et al. 2002) or mice with chronic expression of both human renin and human AGT genes (R+A+ mouse) (Merrill et al. 1996; Davisson et al. 1998), we previously showed that over\u2010expression of these central RAS components increases ACE2 protein expression in the subfornical organ (SFO) and differentially changed the expression in the brainstem (Doobay et al. 2007), supporting the idea that ACE2 acts as a compensatory mechanism to limit brain RAS hyperactivity. In support of this concept, Lin et al. using a gene silencing approach demonstrated that a reduction in AT1R mRNA is associated with a reduction in ACE2 mRNA in the brainstem (Lin et al. 2008). Moreover, we recently showed, for the first time, that ACE2 over\u2010expression in the SFO resulted in the down\u2010regulation of AT1R in this region (Feng et al. 2008b), suggesting that the carboxypeptidase can affect AT1R transcription and/or internalization. However, the lack of available tools to manipulate ACE2 expression has only allowed investigations of the effects of the classic RAS components on ACE2 and additional studies are needed to address the other side of the story.",

These original observations led us to reconsider the role of endogenous ACE2 in the central regulation of BP. Using the same ACE2\u2212/y mouse model, we investigated spontaneous baroreceptor reflex and autonomic function. We observed that ACE2 gene deletion resulted in impaired resting baroreflex sensitivity (Whitaker et al. 2007), increased sympathetic tone and decreased parasympathetic tone (H. Xia and E. Lazartigues, unpublished data). Interestingly, these observations are consistent with subjects presenting a hyperactive RAS like in hypertension and heart failure models (Zucker 2006; Grassi et al. 2007). However, measurement of Ang\u2010II levels in the plasma and the brain of these mice showed no differences between wild\u2010type and ACE2\u2212/y genotypes, suggesting that alteration of baroreflex and autonomic function are not triggered by increased Ang\u2010II levels in the CNS or at the periphery. Previous studies in the periphery have shown the beneficial effects of AT1R blockers in increasing ACE2 mRNA, suggesting that AT1R inhibit ACE2 expression (Ferrario et al. 2005c). In addition, our recent observation that ACE2 over\u2010expression in the brain results in reduced AT1R levels (Feng et al. 2008b), implies that ACE2 is also capable of modulating the expression level of RAS components. Therefore, it is conceivable that ACE2 deletion would result in AT1R up\u2010regulation in the brain of ACE2\u2212/y mice which could then account for the impaired autonomic and baroreflex function in this model. In support of this hypothesis, preliminary data show that central blockade of AT1R by intra\u2010cerebroventricular administration of losartan restored baroreflex sensitivity and decreased BP in ACE2 null mice but not in wild\u2010types (Whitaker et al. 2007; Xia et al., unpublished data), emphasizing the critical role of ACE2 in the central regulation of BP. Additional evidences were recently provided by Diz et al. showing that inhibition of ACE2 activity in the nucleus of the solitary tract attenuates baroreflex function for heart rate control in response to increases in BP (Diz et al. 2008).",

Pioneering this type of experiments with ACE2 at the periphery, Dr. Raizada\u2019s group first showed that ACE2 expression was reduced by 40% in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) of SHR compared with normotensive WKY rats (Yamazato et al. 2007). Interestingly, the authors showed that lentivirus\u2010mediated ACE2 over\u2010expression targeted to the RVLM resulted in the reduction of hypertension in SHR starting 4 weeks after infection. Although lentivirus\u2010mediated gene expression can occur as early as 3 days post\u2010infection, the delayed anti\u2010hypertensive response observed in this study could be due to an insufficient degree of transgene expression. Indeed, while the lentivirus increased the carboxypeptidase expression by 45% in the RVLM compared with untreated SHR, ACE2 protein levels remained 22% lower than that of WKY rats (Yamazato et al. 2007). The mechanism by which ACE2 mediated the reduction of hypertension was not addressed in this study; however, because injection of Ang\u2010(1\u20137) in the RVLM has previously been shown to increase BP (Silva et al. 1993), it is unlikely that this peptide mediated the anti\u2010hypertensive response in SHR. This decrease was probably resulting from the degradation of Ang\u2010II by ACE2 and/or down\u2010regulation of AT1R in this brain region. This interpretation is consistent with our own work, using an adenovirus coding for ACE2 (Feng et al. 2008b). While we showed that ACE2 over\u2010expression in the SFO prevented the Ang\u2010II\u2010mediated pressor and drinking responses, administration of an Ang\u2010(1\u20137) receptor antagonist failed to restore the enhanced BP response. On the other hand, we demonstrated that adenovirus\u2010mediated ACE2 over\u2010expression resulted in the down\u2010regulation of AT1R in the SFO, thus impairing Ang\u2010II downstream signaling (Feng et al. 2008b). In addition, using this adenovirus, we showed that over\u2010expression of ACE2 in the paraventricular nucleus attenuates the increased sympathetic vasomotor tone resulting from Ang\u2010II infusion in ACE2\u2212/y mice, and reduced the associated oxidative stress in the paraventricular nucleus and downstream nuclei (Xia et al. 2008).",

While there has not been any study of the effects of these compounds on central ACE2 expression and/or activity, in vivo studies showed that chronic subcutaneous infusion of Xanthenone decreased BP, improved cardiac function and reversed fibrosis in SHR (Hernandez Prada et al. 2008).

These mice are characterized by high ACE2 expression and activity, restricted to the CNS. Interestingly, syn\u2010hACE2 transgenic mice are protected against RAS over\u2010activity, as illustrated by the absence of neurogenic hypertension following chronic infusion of a subpressor dose of Ang\u2010II (Feng et al. 2008a). This anti\u2010hypertensive response was prevented by co\u2010infusion of an Ang\u2010(1\u20137) receptor inhibitor, and associated with increased NO synthases expression throughout the brain (Y. Feng and E. Lazartigues, unpublished data). These observations suggest that, although impaired Ang\u2010II signaling may participate to the reduced high BP level in syn\u2010hACE2 mice, Ang\u2010(1\u20137) is the major mediator for this response, leading to enhanced NO synthase expression which would favor NO release, thus reinforcing autonomic and baroreflex functions towards the prevention of neurogenic hypertension in this model. In support to the alteration of Ang\u2010II signaling in syn\u2010hACE2 mice, is the blunted drinking response in this model following Ang\u2010II infusion. As demonstrated early on by Fitzsimons (Fitzsimons 1971), Ang\u2010(1\u20137) has no effect on water intake and this could be confirmed in syn\u2010hACE2 by the inability of the Ang\u2010(1\u20137) blocker to restore the high drinking behavior observed in non\u2010transgenic littermates (Feng et al., unpublished data). Therefore, syn\u2010hACE2 transgenic mice constitute a new interesting model to elucidate the participation of central ACE2 in various physiological responses originating in the brain and associated to a hyperactive RAS. It is likely that this model will be very useful to assess the benefits of central ACE2 in cardiovascular pathologies such as heart failure and stroke, but also in neurological affections like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, depression, stress and impaired cognition (Phillips and de Oliveira 2008).",

The use of transgenic animals with brain\u2010targeted expression of the classic RAS components has proven extremely useful towards solving this issue (Davisson 2003; Lavoie and Sigmund 2003). ACE2 is no exception, as it is present both in the brain and the periphery. As a first step to separate central and systemic effects of ACE2, we have developed a new transgenic mouse model (bACE2) expressing ACE2 only in the brain and therefore removing the responses associated with activation of peripheral ACE2. Instead of using CRE/LoxP or shRNA systems that would require the generation and characterization of new transgenic mice, we opted for a simpler and faster strategy by taking advantage of already existing models. Using genetic complementation, our approach has been to introduce brain\u2010selective expression of the enzyme into an ACE2 nullified background. Accordingly, by breeding ACE2\u2212/y mice, lacking the ACE2 gene, with syn\u2010hACE2 mice, expressing the hACE2 gene specifically in the CNS, we were able to generate a new mouse model with \u2018brain only\u2019 expression of ACE2 (Fig. 2b). Consistent with the parent strains, preliminary data indicate that resting hemodynamic parameters are normal in bACE2 mice. This new model should be helpful in addressing the participation of peripheral ACE2 in normal and pathophysiologic conditions.",

Sigmund, University of Iowa). Because of the species\u2010specificity of the AGT and renin components, both human genes have to be present for the R+A+ mouse to be hypertensive (Merrill et al. 1996). These mice develop hypertension early on and are characterized by elevated plasma renin activity and elevated Ang\u2010II levels. In addition, chronic over\u2010production of Ang\u2010II has been associated with resetting of the cardiac baroreflex (Merrill et al. 1996) and hemorrhagic stroke (Iida et al. 2005; Wakisaka et al. 2008) in this model. We recently observed that baroreflex sensitivity was also reduced in R+A+ mice while ACE2 activity was elevated in the brain (Xia et al. 2007). Therefore, the newly generated SARA mice constitute a new tool to investigate the ability of central ACE2 in preventing the development of chronic hypertension. In addition, they could represent an interesting model to assess the potential of brain ACE2 in limiting the occurrence of hemorrhagic stroke.",

Evidence is accumulating for the importance of ACE2 as a regulator of this system. Through its ability to degrade Ang\u2010II to Ang\u2010(1\u20137), ACE2 is able to regulate local Ang\u2010II levels thereby modulating its effects. It is reasonable to conclude from the above discussion that ACE2 may play a protective role in the brain by balancing the ACE/Ang\u2010II/AT1R axis. Disturbance of the balance could alter the levels of Ang\u2010II and contribute to the development of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. The new ACE2/Ang\u2010(1\u20137)/Mas axis is present in central areas related to the control of cardiovascular function and therefore provides new possibilities to counter\u2010regulate the effects of Ang\u2010II in the brain, and to develop new strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular and neurological diseases.",

Angiotensinogen produced by glial cells is transformed by renin to form Ang\u2010I, which is then converted by ACE into Ang\u2010II. This octapeptide can be hydrolyzed by ACE2 to form Ang\u2010(1\u20137) or converted to the heptapepetide Ang\u2010III by aminopeptidase A (APA) and further degraded to Ang\u2010IV by aminopeptidase N (APN). ACE2 also cleaves Ang\u2010I to Ang\u2010(1\u20139), the latter being converted by ACE into Ang\u2010(1\u20137). Ang\u2010(1\u20137) can also be formed by neprilysin (NEP) from Ang\u2010I or Ang\u2010(1\u20139). ACE metabolizes Ang\u2010(1\u20137) to the inactive peptide Ang\u2010(1\u20105).

Ang\u2010(1\u20137) acting on the Mas receptor may attenuate the actions of the ACE/Ang\u2010II/AT1R pathway through inhibition of the MAPKK pathway and stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) release. In addition to Ang\u2010II, renin binding to (Pro)renin receptors (PRR) and Ang\u2010III binding to AT1R also trigger activation of the MAPKK\u2013ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
