When in an environment containing this potential hazard, both surgical masks (SM) and N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) have been used by the general public as well as health care workers. While the superior filtration and fit characteristics of N95 FFR over surgical masks have been demonstrated in laboratory and workplace studies with inert (non-biological) particles, their superiority in reducing disease transmission in clinical/field settings is still questioned by some members of the health care/infection control industry. Attempts to study the relative efficacy of the two devices in the field using clinical outcomes have yielded inconclusive results because of limitations in experimental design and implementation.",

No study to date has been conducted in a manner that would allow the performance of the two types of devices to be differentiated. In particular, study subjects failing to wear the assigned device during all times of potential exposure, along with a lack of continuous observation of subjects' use, compromise the superior protection the N95 FFR can provide. Additionally, the lack of formalized, complete respiratory protection programs negates the superior filtration and fit characteristics of the N95 FFR. As has been shown in industrial workplaces, one may reasonably expect that N95 FFR will effectively reduce health care workers' inhalation INTRODUCTION R espiratory protection devices are an important element of an overall contagion control strategy when infectious biological aerosols are potentially present in an occupational environment. In health care facilities, N95 class FFR certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are typically the minimum class of respiratory protection recommended. (1, 2) In contrast, studies exist that suggest that surgical masks normally used in health care settings may be equally effective in reducing disease transmission. (3, 4) The \"respirator versus surgical mask\" debate continues in both health care and non-health care settings.",

Stated briefly, surgical masks (SM) are intended to prevent bacteria and other particles exhaled by the wearer from contaminating a sterile field (e.g., patient's wound). This device also serves as a barrier to prevent the wearer from touching his/her oronasal region with contaminated hands or gloves as well as to protect that region from direct sprays and splashes. SM are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Particle filtration performance evaluation is recommended, but no minimum level of filtration efficiency is required.

However, FFRs' primary function is to reduce the wearer's exposure to particles with aerodynamic diameters in the inhalable (\u2264100 \u03bcm) size fraction, including those in the respirable size range (\u226410 \u03bcm). (6) Numerous studies have demonstrated that biological and non-biological particles are filtered in the same manner, with equivalent efficiency. (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) Filtration efficiency criteria for N95 FFR are set by NIOSH and are measured under rigorous test conditions. (14) Any certified particulate respirator must be at least 95% efficient when tested according to NIOSH criteria. In addition, FFR must be capable of forming a seal to the user's face in order to be worn in an occupational setting. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has specific test criteria for demonstrating acceptable respirator fit on each individual user. (15) OSHA also regulates FFR selection, use, and care in workplaces, including health care facilities. (15, 16) The filtration and fit characteristics of SM were evaluated by Oberg and Brosseau. (17) Nine surgical masks, six of which met all FDA performance criteria, were subjected to the NIOSH filtration efficiency test and OSHA-mandated fit tests. The filters ranged from approximately 10% to 96% efficiency under the NIOSH test conditions; only one SM met the NIOSH minimum requirement for filter efficiency. This finding was consistent with research done by NIOSH, which also found a wide range of filtration performance for SM tested at the NIOSH filtration test conditions. (18) Furthermore, quantitative fit tests conducted by Oberg and Brosseau resulted in only two acceptable fits out of 40 trials. Consequently, small particles are likely to enter the wearer's breathing zone via both the SM itself (poor filtration) and the gaps between the SM and the skin of the face (poor fit). As such, SM cannot be expected to significantly reduce the inhalation of infectious aerosols.",

Recent field studies (26, 27) suggested that long-range transmission of influenza is possible via aerosols in the respirable size range. Additionally, investigations of disease outbreaks (28, 29) suggest proximity to the index (first) case as a major factor in respiratory disease transmission. This may indicate increased inhalation exposure to small particles, and/or transmission of a virus (e.g., influenza) by particles >100 \u03bcm (droplets, sprays) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is traditionally believed that droplet spray transmission occurs only within a radius of approximately \u223c3 feet from the infected person, although recent recommendations have suggested that 6 to 10 feet may be prudent for emerging or highly virulent pathogens. (2) Transmission of some viruses may occur by touching contaminated surfaces or objects with the hands and subsequently touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. Exposure of unprotected eyes to airborne viruses may also contribute to infection. (19) Importantly, the relative contribution of each mode of transmission is not clear for many diseases. (30, 31) By limiting droplet spray and hand contact with the nose and mouth, both FFR and SM may limit disease transmission by these routes. Because only FFR are designed and tested to filter small aerosols and effectively seal to the user's face (demonstrated by individual fit testing), they are expected to be more effective than SM in controlling transmission of disease via particle inhalation. It is also critical that gloves, gowns, and eye protection be used in conjunction with hand washing to control the non-inhalation exposure routes if the efficacy of either FFR or SM is to be assessed. This \"bundling\" of interventions can, in itself, confound the evaluation of FFR or SM performance.",

Accordingly, no field study of FFR or SM performance against pathogens such as influenza has attempted to measure airborne biological particles either outside (C o ) or inside (C i ) the device during periods of exposure. This means there is no assurance that the device under evaluation was tested with a sufficient concentration of airborne infectious agents, or how much the device was able to reduce the inhaled exposure. In contrast, workplace studies of FFR performance against inert hazards use C o and C i measurements to define the device's efficacy: the calculated C o :C i ratio represents performance, i.e., how much the FFR reduces exposure and is called the workplace protection factor (WPF). (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) For contaminants with exposure limits, FFR performance is adequate when C i measurements are below that limit. While C o :C i ratios for biological contaminants may not be convenient (or even feasible) to measure at this time, they would provide reasonable estimates of the actual exposure reduction provided by the devices in use.",

(3, 4, 12, 13, (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) Most are epidemiological studies that use FFR or SM as an intervention, alone, or in combination with other interventions. Performance of the respiratory device is evaluated based on changes in clinical outcomes (e.g., infection rate of the group using the device). No study to date has adequately taken into account the five confounding factors listed above. Until this is done, definitive conclusions about the ability of either FFR or SM to reduce disease transmission cannot be drawn. The reliance on subjects' self-reporting and/or inconsistent monitoring of the compliance of subjects' use of the device under evaluation are the deficiencies common to nearly every study to date addressing the effects of FFR or SM use on disease transmission. Estimated compliance rates in the range of 50-75% are commonly reported. (21, 23) However, it is important to note that self-reported compliance is not a reliable indicator of actual compliance. For example, one study on hand hygiene compliance among health care workers (HCW) reported low correlation between self-reported adherence and observed adherence, with statistically higher levels of selfreported compliance compared to observed compliance. (44) For FFR/SM, no study was found to report 100% wear time during all exposure periods, verified by continuous, direct observation of test subjects. As shown in Figure 1 , non-wear during exposure rapidly reduces the superior respiratory protection expected of FFR as compared to SM.",

Subject compliance (wear) rates were not known, as only periodic audits of device usage were done. In addition, use of gloves, gowns, and hand washing were not monitored, and the possibility of community exposure to influenza was acknowledged. \u2022 Another study of the efficacy of SM and N95 FFR (both fit tested and not fit tested) in HCW found respiratory illness/influenza infection rates in workers in either FFR group were roughly half the rate of those wearing SM. (22) Interestingly, both groups of FFR performed equivalently, i.e., fit testing showed no beneficial effect. While laboratory studies show that FFR are expected to provide more protection from inhaled aerosols than SM, it is not certain that they were actually responsible for the lower infection rates in the two groups who wore them. First, the authors defined compliance as wearing the device as \u226580% of the work shift, and 68-76% of subjects were said to comply (Figure 1 ). Compliance was determined by head nurses' observations and subjects' self-reporting. Additionally, the devices were evaluated in different groups of hospitals, and no air samples were taken to ensure exposures were equivalent for all the groups. Again, it is plausible that exposures and behaviors (including non-compliance) at individual sites were dissimilar and could account for the differences in infection rates. \u2022 Studies of health care facilities that used both N95 FFR and SM for workers potentially exposed to H1N1 influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been reported by Seto et al.

Although many laboratory studies in controlled environments using manikins and human subjects exist, there have been no properly designed field studies to assess the ability of FFR and SM to reduce disease transmission rates. The difficulty of conducting such studies is compounded by lack of exposure limits, knowledge of an inhaled infectious dose, multiple exposure venues, and the interactions of several interventions used simultaneously.

            "text": "Furthermore, no evidence suggests that significant respiratory protection from biological aerosols can be achieved in any exposure venue without addressing respirator program elements. Unlike health care workplaces, members of the general public or casual (voluntary) workplace users will not have identified where and when exposures to infectious aerosols might occur; it is therefore likely that FFR would not be in use when an exposure does occur. Secondly, the benefits of individual fit testing have been well documented, (34-38, 53,54) and general public FFR users generally do not make the effort to be fit tested properly. Thus, these users may or may not achieve meaningful inhalation exposure reduction, even if the FFR is properly donned during an exposure episode. These limitations hold for all FFR, including those cleared by the FDA as N95/surgical masks or for general public use. (55) As is the case with any respiratory hazard, the industrial hygiene hierarchy of controls should be applied to control infectious aerosols; the hazard should be reduced through engineering and administrative methods to the extent possible. Infection control practices and the use of other personal protective equipment as described Siegel et al. (56) should also be implemented.",
