The LTCF performed routine surveillance for respiratory illness year-round by recording daily temperatures and assessing for symptoms. After reporting the outbreak, personnel of the LTCF initiated active surveillance for new cases of respiratory illnesses in residents and staff and, when feasible, collected specimens from ill patients. Epidemiologic and clinical data for residents were obtained by reviewing their medical and hospitalization records, and data for staff were obtained by interview with a standardized questionnaire. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens, sputum samples (from patients who could cough), and serum samples were transported on ice to the California Department of Health Services Viral and Rickettsial Laboratory.",

This is supported by the lacking evidence of other viral pathogens, the temporally and geographically sharp definition of the outbreak, the observation that health care workers concurrently suffered only mild symptoms, and the discovery that a majority of the rhinovirus isolates were of the same serotype. Almost one-half of our patients had a history of underlying severe cardiopulmonary or neurologic disease; this is consistent with other reports that suggest an increased likelihood of lower respiratory tract complications from rhinovirus infection in patients with chronic underlying illness [3]. Although some studies have suggested that certain antigenically related groups are associated with higher incidence of infection, increased clinical virulence, and prolonged viral shedding, others have not found any relation between the severity of illness and the specific serotypes [14, 15]. A notable exception is rhinovirus 16, which has been associated with bronchial inflammation, airway hyperresponsivness, and asthma exacerbations [16]. Rhinovirus 82 has not been specifically associated with increased virulence in clinical or laboratory studies; further studies on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics associated with individual serogroups are merited.",

Respiratory pathogens, such as rhinovirus, which may cause only mild symptoms in healthy persons, can be a source of major morbidity and mortality in elderly or immunocompromised populations. These agents may be ubiquitous in the health care worker and visitor populations who have contact with these patients. Rigorous respiratory hygiene measures have been strongly advocated in the wake of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza, their universal practice can also protect vulnerable patients from what are otherwise considered to be benign pathogens in healthy populations.",
