Practical sheets for patients ( Fig. 1 ) and practitioners ( Fig. 2) were drawn up jointly by the French ENT Society (SFORL), the French ENT National Union, the French ENT College, and the French National Professional ENT Council to guide the choice between calling the French emergency services (dialling 15), teleconsultation, face-to-face consultation, and postponing the consultation. To allow the population to visit ENT practices confidently and avoid postponing urgent treatments, enhanced protective measures were laid out by the Health Ministry in conjunction with the French Public Health Council and the French Society for Hospital Hygiene. These were circulated in town-based practices and in regional healthcare facilities by the network of Support Centres for the Prevention of Healthcare-associated Infections. As the independent and apolitical French organization called Institut de Sant\u00e9 (\"Health Institute\") points out, some treatments of ENT diseases that could have been deferred by a few weeks are now becoming urgent at the risk of constituting a real loss of chance for the patient's recovery or survival (https://www.institut-sante.org/ covid19-plan-de-sortie-de-crise-de-linstitut-sante/). The protective measures applied during the lockdown period will be maintained once the lockdown is over to allow the resumption of treatments and to prevent their cessation and delay. ENT specialists in private practices and in hospitals have a proactive role to play for their patients (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/ organisation soins-hospitaliers covid-19.pdf). The best practice recommendations for ENT consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic have been drawn up because ENT examinations and treatments risk the practitioner being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 contamination in certain instances [1] . Thus, ENT specialists are among the professionals who are most exposed to COVID-19.",

Human coronaviruses can be effectively inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with solutions containing 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite with a minimum contact time of 1 min. By analogy with other enveloped viruses, disinfectant cleaners meeting European virucidal standard EN 14476 for enveloped viruses (Vaccinia test strain) would inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.sf2h. net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Avis-SF2H-05-avril-2020-D\u00e9sin fection-scanner-et-autres-appareils-dimagerie.pdf). In practice, it is recommended to clean frequently touched surfaces with 14476-standard virucidal disinfectant cleaning wipes at least twice a day, paying particular attention to surfaces in direct contact with patients (door handles, furniture, toilet flush, sink, etc.), to ventilate the premises extensively and regularly, and to schedule a complete bio-cleaning once a day (preferably in the evening).",

As a precaution and depending on the decision of the consultant or the facility, the decision may be taken to have each team ENT medical team already take the standard precautions assuming that each individual is potentially a carrier of, colonised by, or infected by micro-organisms that can be transmitted during treatment (https://www.sf2h.net/publications/actualisationprecautions-standard-2017). During ENT examinations or procedures without exposure to projection/aerosolization of organic material of human origin (PAOM) ( Table 1) , the ENT medical team wear clean outfits as well as single-use gloves in case of contact with a mucosa (Table 2) . For examinations and procedures with exposure to PAOM (Table 1) , protection must be supplemented by wearing a surgical mask, protective goggles (glasses do not ensure this protection), a single-use plastic apron, and singleuse gloves ( Table 2 ). For patients who are known carriers of or infected by certain pathogens, protection can be supplemented in three different ways according to the type of infectious agents. As part of \"contact\" precautions, wearing a single-use plastic apron (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Extended spectrum \u2424-Lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus faecalis of intermediate sensitivity or resistant to vancomycin, cutaneous staphylococci and streptococci, herpes, hepatitis A and E, Rotavirus, etc.) or a long-sleeved overgown (scabies, Clostridium difficile infection, acute gastroenteritis) is recommended. As part of \"droplet\" precautions, which are necessary in particular in case of seasonal flu, respiratory syncytial virus infection, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, rubella, whooping cough, meningococcus infection, and bronchiolitis, a surgical mask (ENT care without PAOM) or an FFP2/N95-type respiratory protection device (RPD) (ENT care with PAOM) and protective goggles should be worn. An FFP2/N95 RPD and protective goggles are also recommended for pathogens requiring \"airborne\" precautions (measles, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus MERSCoV, pulmonary tuberculosis, chicken pox, tuberculoid leprosy, avian flu, etc.).",

According to the scientific data available, particularly on exposure to SARS-CoV-2 while breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing, and despite the absence of specific studies on aerosol generation or micro-organism transmission while conducting ENT procedures, the examinations and procedures potentially at risk of transmitting infectious aerosols are listed in Table 1 (https://www.inspq.qc.ca/sites/default/ files/covid/chuq-imga-covid.pdf) [2] . For ENT examinations and treatments without PAOM, the professional wears a long sleeve outfit, a surgical mask, and gloves in case of contact with a mucosa ( Table 2) . For ENT treatments with exposure to PAOM, their conduct requires additional precautions taking contact, droplets and airborne into account ( Table 2 ). These additional measures deal with the type of mask to use (surgical mask or FFP2/N95 RPD), eye protection, and the standard gown (long sleeves). It is possible to extend the use of the FFP2/N95 RPD for several patient Table 2 ENT precautions for all patients, outside of the COVID-19 pandemic (standard precautions) and during phases 3 and 4 of the COVID-19 pandemic (standard and additional precautions) (https://www.sf2h.net/publications/actualisation-precautions-standard-2017 Single-use apron [3] Long-sleeved disposable overgown [3] Hair cap PAOM: projection/aerosolization of organic material of human origin; RPD: respiratory protection device (FFP2/N95).

[2] The maximum duration of wearing surgical masks is 4 h and that of RPD FFP2/N95 is theoretically 8 h even if, in practice, it is difficult to resist as many hours with an RPD because of the respiratory discomfort caused by this device.

For ENT care with exposure to PAOM in the context of a COVID-19 pandemic, you can choose either to change your gown between each patient, or to keep your gown and wear it over a single-use apron that you can change between each patient.",

Surgical activity has been reorganised [3] . After the end of the lockdown, the provision of ENT treatment is resuming in town-based practices and hospitals with the objective of avoiding any delayed diagnosis and any loss of chance for the patient's recovery or survival (https://solidaritessante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/organisation soins-hospitaliers covid-19. pdf). It is recommended that ENT specialists actively contact patients and parents of children with chronic pathologies whose consultations have been postponed in order to encourage them to attend an ENT consultation. This resumption of ENT diagnostic, screening, and consultation activities must be organized within the framework of a coordinated action between private structures, public hospitals, medical analysis laboratories and radiology centres, and must continue to rely in part on teleconsultation (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/organisation soins-hosp italiers covid-19.pdf). Considering the significant risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during their conduct, these high-risk ENT examinations and procedures will be limited to those, which are absolutely necessary for a COVID-19 patient. They may be postponed to when the patient is no longer contagious. As far as possible, the ENT specialist will attempt to plan these high-risk procedures in advance to avoid having to carry them out in an emergency situation. Confinement entailed a risk of disorganized screening, surveillance and monitoring of ENT cancers. Regarding neonatal screening for deafness, its disorganisation is linked to very short stays in maternity hospitals, which compromises the thoroughness of retesting. The resumption of ENT activity in centres specialising in paediatric audiology must avoid any loss of chance for the patient.",

            "text": "Flexible ENT endoscopy is a typical example of an ENT examination at risk of exposure to PAOM. During its realization, it is advisable to avoid the presence in the room of any person whose presence is not necessary. The endoscope should be placed on a dedicated, easily cleanable table. It should be protected by a single-use protective sheath (https://www.hcsp.fr/Explore.cgi/ avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=21). This sheath should be removed immediately after use and eliminated in the Infectious Medical Waste (IMW) system (https://www.hcsp.fr/Explore.cgi/avisr apportsdomaine?clefr=21). The endoscope should be disinfected as per the standard procedure as the virus is susceptible to the disinfectant products usually used: careful wiping of the nasal endoscope with a wet (or pre-soaked) single-use 14476-standard virucidal disinfectant-cleaning wipe (https://www.hcsp.fr/ Explore.cgi/avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=21). The disinfection is conducted along the whole length of the scope, including the proximal sections that have not been in direct contact with the patient's nasal cavities. The use of a fiberscope camera is advised to allow for distancing between the patient and the ENT physician. After the endoscopy, the surfaces located near where the endoscopy was carried out (tables, floor, etc.) must be cleaned with a virucidal disinfectant detergent EN 14476 to remove any contaminating projections. If a sheath was not used, the disinfection of the device must comply with the best practice rules laying down the standard procedures for treating thermosensitive endoscopes without an operating channel using bactericidal and virucidal products (https://www.hcsp.fr/Explore.cgi/avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=21). After the examination, the professional must carefully disrobe in compliance with hygiene rules, with the immediate elimination of gloves, mask, hair cap, and overgown in the IMW system for treatments in healthcare facilities, or as per the system for non-infected medical waste for doctors' offices (domestic waste stream, double-bagged with 24 hours' storage before elimination) (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/guide-covid-19-phaseepidemique-v15-16032020.pdf).

ENT teleconsultation allows physicians to continue taking care of patients who cannot travel and makes it possible to ensure continuity of care while limiting the preventable risks of spreading the coronavirus within ENT private practices and healthcare facilities (https://solidarites-sante.gouv. fr/IMG/pdf/covid-19 teleconsultation-fiche-medecin.pdf; https:// solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/soins-et-maladies/maladies/maladiesinfectieuses/coronavirus/professionnels-de-sante/article/telecons ultation-et-covid-19-qui-peut-pratiquer-a-distance-et-comment). It also allows the ENT specialist to select patients who can be counselled or treated without the need for a face-to-face consultation (leaving the possibility of a follow-up telephone callback) and those who must be received at the doctor's office. This teleconsultation may include an interview, an inspection of the head and neck region, a self-palpation of the patient, the commented reading of results of biological tests or radiological reports, and the renewal or adaptation of treatments already prescribed. This remote consulting arrangement was made available to all patients and all ENT specialists with 100% coverage by the French social security system. Communication without video is accepted for the following patients: those aged 70 or over, those being monitored for a long-term health condition, those living in areas with no signal, and those ill with or suspected of having COVID-19. This new organisation in the field of healthcare is not adapted to all situations. Wherever the ENT specialist deems it necessary, they may interrupt the teleconsultation and suggest a physical consultation.",

It is important that the self-administered test be carried out in a quiet environment. The second level involves the caregiver managing the patient in their everyday life. Finally, the third level allows the ENT specialist to interact directly with the patient to carry out tone audiometry with masking of the non-test ear, vocal audiometry using lists of words, phonemes, or validated pseudo-words in French, or even vocal audiometry in noise. The tele-audiometry data must be stored on a server labelled HDS (Healthcare Data Hosting).",
