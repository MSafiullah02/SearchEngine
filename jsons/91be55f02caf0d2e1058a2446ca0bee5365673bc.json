Its origins are found in the remote past. Over the millennia, its origins and significance have been immersed in religious beliefs in evil thoughts or sinful human behavior with special opportunities for redemption through rituals performed by healers, by sacrifice, or by prayer. Consequently, medical attempts have evaded our understanding. Even to this day, rheumatologists, who are often asked to assess and manage such afflicted patients, say that they have no relevance to their focus of interest in people with discernible objective evidence for arthritic or immunological disease pathology. Even though such patients search for understanding and help with their affliction and suffering, they may face rejection by physicians or exploitation by remedies that do not improve their sleep or cure them of their bodily complaints. This matter of despair and hopelessness is clearly and simply described in Ecclesiastes 2:23, \"All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.\" Despite Ecclesiastes, a pessimistic perspective on the troubles of mankind, this chapter focuses on our efforts to bring scientific understanding to how the physiology of sleeping-waking brain allows us to better understand the origins and management of their widespread pain, suffering, and disability.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Such people have acquired a variety of diagnostic labels by various medical disciplines, as though a mere diagnosis provides both understanding and treatment. At the turn of the last century, such people were given the label, \"fibrositis\" by an English neurologist, William Gower. He believed that the basis of his patients' painful limbs and backs were the result of inflammation of fibrous tissue. When systematic studies of infectious or disease pathology could not be verified, the term became a wastebasket diagnosis used by rheumatologists to differentiate these patients from those with similar symptoms but having objective evidence for disease pathology. Other medical specialists, to whom such afflicted people would visit, applied explanations that relate to their specialty's focus of interest.

These features often occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Without the objective evidence for arthritic, neuroendocrine, or immunological disease pathology, the community of rheumatologists abandoned the term of ill-understood \"fibrositis\" and adopted the now-popular descriptive diagnosis, \"fibromyalgia\" (FM) or \"fibromyalgia syndrome\" (FMS). The formalization of criteria for the diagnosis approved by the American College of Rheumatology in 1991 [1] permitted epidemiological studies to determine the prevalence of the syndrome. Subsequently, approximately 2 % of the US population (3.4 % women, 0.5 % men) were found to be affected [2] . Those with the diffuse musculoskeletal pains and debilitating fatigue in five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) affected 2.9 % of the population (3.6 % women and 2.1 % men) [3] , making this rheumatic disorder the second most common rheumatic ailment after osteoarthritis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 825, "end": 828, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1015, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1225, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "About the same time, infectious disease experts noted that pain and fatigue symptoms prevailed long after an acute infectious disease had past. They variously diagnosed such patients as having a post-infectious or post-viral syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), and Epstein virus syndrome. Where a sporadic cluster of such mysterious ailments appeared, diagnostic labels were attributed to geographic locations, e.g., in 1934, Los Angeles County Hospital disease also known at the time as \"atypical poliomyelitis\"; in 1948-1949, Akureyri disease (also called Iceland disease); and in 1955, London's Royal Free (Hospital) disease, which subsequently was thought to be a form of mass hysteria. The absence of any verifiable evidence for any specific infectious agent or inflammatory disease pathology proved perplexing for infectious disease specialists. The lack of objective evidence for a specific virus or specific infectious disease led to a committee of advisory experts to the US Centre for Disease Control to formalize criteria. The current diagnosis, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), came into existence [4] . This vague descriptive label emerged in 1994 much to the chagrin of affected American patients who advocate for special recognition by government health agencies for their preferred term \"chronic immune deficiency syndrome.\" In the UK, the label chronic infectious neuromyasthenia encephalitis is preferred. Often, there is an overlap among the variable clinical criteria adopted by committees of the various medical disciplines so that some authors have referred to such patients as coming under an umbrella of a cluster of overlapping ailments (see Table 48 .1). The overriding common feature is the absence of any known clinical features of disease or signs of any abnormalities in any radiological, hematological, histological, chemical, metabolic, or immunological tests. Nevertheless, the hunt for a viral etiology persists with the most current being the 1990 report in Science on the prevalence of a retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) finding in more than 60 % of the patients with CFS. Two years of several scientific reports of failures to replicate the initial findings led to a formal retraction by this journal in November 2011 [5] . A viral etiology, however, remains relevant in selected populations with post-febrile persistent chronic fatigue and diffuse myalgia. For example, following an outbreak in Toronto of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), those who had survived and had no residual respiratory disease 1-3 years later had persistent diffuse myalgia, disabling fatigue, weakness with unrefreshing sleep, and anomalous increased sleep EEG alpha and the EEG sleep cyclical alternating pattern (CAP) in non-REM sleep.

They range from neurasthenia and hysterical conversion disorder to somatoform pain disorder, somatization disorder, and now the DSM-5 feckless diagnosis, \"somatic symptom disorder\" [7] . This chain of psychiatric labels represents a history of collective transient agreements by generations of US psychiatric committees that have applied some form of presumed scientific explanations to bodily complaints and sickness where there is no satisfactory medical or psychological explanation.

In non-Western societies, the systems of beliefs, their respective special names, and remedial methods are deemed to be features of culture-bound syndromes. For example, hwa-byung, a Korean folk illness is characterized by insomnia, pains, fatigue, weakness, gastrointestinal symptoms, and emotional distress. Chinese patients who have sleep difficulties, headaches, various pains, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction are termed shenjing shuairuo.

Based upon experimental evidence, Moldofsky proposed the hypothesis that the sleeping/waking brain is integral to the somatic and behavioral symptoms of these ill-understood painful, fatiguing, distressing, and often disabling chronic illnesses [8] . This hypothesis gives rise to the following questions: 1. How does the sleeping-waking brain connect to these poorly understood somatic and behavioral symptoms? 2. Does an understanding of the disturbances in the sleeping/waking brain favorably influence the management of these suffering patients?

Manifestations of disturbed sleep typically comprise the experience of light and unrefreshing sleep, nocturnal restlessness with frequent awakenings, and at times, sleep-related loud snoring and breathing problems, or periodic involuntary leg movements. Typically, there is a variation in the diurnal pattern of symptoms. Upon awakening from their poor quality of sleep, patients usually experience generalized muscular stiffness, diffuse pain, and profound fatigue, which are unchanged or even increased compared to the previous evening. They report improvement in symptoms with improved energy from late morning to mid-afternoon; then, thereafter there is a downhill course in symptoms as the day progresses. The narrower the period of improvement, the more disabled is the patient. On the rare occasion, they might achieve a restful night of sleep and improved symptoms on the following day. Indeed, unrefreshing or nonrestorative sleep is closely correlated to the widespread pain and tender points in FM while psychological distress is not [12] . FM subjects with light unrefreshing sleep have diurnal impairment in speed of performance on complex cognitive tasks, which are accompanied by sleepiness, fatigue, and negative mood. Such psychological impairment could account for the functional disabilities that are encountered in a work environment and in social behavior. There may be an associated predisposition to emotional hypersensitivity resulting from distrust and insecure attachment in their personality, which is shown to be associated with the alpha-EEG anomaly during sleep [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 368, "end": 371, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 372, "end": 375, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 490, "end": 494, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1546, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2093, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Review of EEG Sleep, Pain, and Fatigue"}, {"text": "These disabling behavioral symptoms are commonly associated with disturbances in the physiology of sleep [8, 9] . How these FM symptoms are linked to the subjective poor sleep quality and objective PSG measures continues to be of considerable interest in determining the pathophysiology of this illness. Early on, aspects of anomalous changes in EEG sleep physiology were identified in FM patients that were considered to be consistent with subjective poor quality of sleep. Nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) shows a prominent EEG alpha frequency (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) Hz) rhythm in the central EEG regions during stages 2 and slow-wave sleep (SWS) NREM sleep (see Fig. 48 .1) but less frequently in patients with severely diminished or absent delta SWS [8] . As Hauri and Hawkins had noticed this alpha EEG anomaly to coincide with the delta frequency (0-<4 Hz) slow waves of SWS, they coined the term alpha-delta sleep, which they described in a small group of not depressed psychiatric patients with poorly understood illness who complained of chronic, somatic malaise, and fatigue [14] . Subsequently, Moldofsky and colleagues reported this anomaly in patients with so-called fibrositis [11] , later considered by rheumatologists to be a wastebasket diagnosis because of the lack of replicated evidence of presumed inflammation of fibrous tissue. Subsequently, the symptoms were relabeled as FM or FMS. This anomalous alpha EEG sleep is seen predominantly in the frontal-central brain area in contrast to the alpha EEG frequency occurring in quiet wakefulness that is localized in the occipital region [15, 16] . Subsequently, reports of this anomalous increased alpha EEG activity in NREM sleep were reported in FM patients [8, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Patients with FMS, however, are heterogeneous with respect to exhibiting the alpha anomaly [21] . This alpha activity in NREM sleep is not specific to FM, since it occurs in patients with other painful rheumatic diseases. Moreover, it is described to occur in patients with primary insomnia [22] . As EEG alpha-like rhythm is associated with mentation [16, 18] , alpha occurring in NREM sleep may represent a vigilant arousal state that interferes with bodily restorative functions [8] . This abnormal EEG sleep feature may account for a common aspect of impaired sleep quality with symptoms of light sleep and sleep mentation with external environmental awareness and internal self-awareness of subjective discomfort. This sense of vigilance is shown to be associated with an underlying faulty personality characteristic in such people with the prominent alpha EEG sleep anomaly and physical illness which stems from a faulty interactional pattern of childhood personality development. In formal personality testing of such people with the alpha EEG sleep anomaly, most of whom have FMS, they show a pattern of overall distrust and insecurity in interpersonal relationships. Consequently, this pervasive sense of insecurity and distrust, which are ingrained in their personalities, is thought to make them difficult to accept any medical therapeutic effort that results in perpetuation of chronic physical illness behavior [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 105, "end": 108, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 109, "end": 111, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 545, "end": 548, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 549, "end": 552, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 553, "end": 557, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 558, "end": 562, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 563, "end": 567, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1088, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1194, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1609, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1610, "end": 1613, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1731, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1736, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1741, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1742, "end": 1746, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1751, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1756, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1854, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2054, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2111, "end": 2115, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2116, "end": 2119, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2241, "end": 2244, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3183, "end": 3187, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 664, "end": 671, "text": "Fig. 48", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Review of EEG Sleep, Pain, and Fatigue"}, {"text": "A second physiological component of impaired sleep quality is thought to be a specific EEG pattern that contributes to unstable or nonrestorative sleep, a major diagnostic feature of FMS and CFS. This objective physiological feature in the sleep EEG sleep comprises a high frequency of the CAP. The CAP phenomenon occurs variably throughout NREM sleep characterized by a frequency of approximately 20-30 cycles per second (see Fig. 48 .1). The specific type of CAP is reported to reflect a measure of relative stable-unstable sleep. In patients with FMS and CFS where unstable or nonrestorative sleep is commonly reported, there is an increase of CAP activity. The sleep EEG dominant rhythm of CAP A1 and no significant ancillary increase in autonomic or peripheral EMG activity, as seen in CAP A2 and increased in CAP A3, is associated with sleep stability that is commonly found in young asymptomatic healthy people. In the subgroup CAP A2 and CAP A3, there is physiological evidence for progressive increases in sleep instability [23] [24] [25] . This high amount of CAP correlates with the severity of pain as measured by the number of tender points in FMS [23] . The EEG CAP A2 and especially CAP A3 are associated with pathological sleep characterized by physiological evidence of motor and autonomic nervous system abnormalities, e.g., periodic limb movement (PLM) and sleep apnea disorders [24, 26] . Such clinically significant periodic PSG sleep disorders are found in a large sample of US patients with FMS. In this multicenter PSG study of more than 200 FMS patients, 94 % were female, with a mean body mass index of about 30 who had FMS for more than 5 years. Approximately 15 % had moderate to severe apnea-hypopnea respiratory index and 20 % had PLM disorder [24] .

Quantitative studies suggest that the duration of SWS serves to regulate homeostasis and is correlated with the amount of prior waking. That is, SWS increases following extended wakefulness and is decreased during nocturnal sleep following a daytime nap containing SWS [31] . This decreased amount of SWS in FM might indicate an impairment of the SWS homeostatic drive. Some sleep abnormalities in FM patients have not been consistently reported. In some studies, for example, FM patients are reported to be not significantly different from controls with respect to alpha sleep EEG activity or the duration of SWS [28, 32] .

In 1975 and 1976 publications, they showed that by interrupting SWS with auditory stimuli, an FM-like state including variable aching, fatigue, and increased sensitivity to pain pressure could be induced in healthy normal nonathletic subjects [11, 37] . They also showed in a small pilot study that under similar experimental prospective sleep and symptom test circumstances, several members of the University of Toronto track team did not experience such pain and fatigue symptoms. This preliminary finding suggests that aerobic physical fitness is involved in preventing or reducing the emergence of these symptoms. Since then, other researchers have confirmed that selective deprivation or disruption of sleep induces increased bodily sensitivity, decreased pain threshold, and reports of nonrestorative sleep [8, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . One study involving presumably fit US military men found a reduction of pain threshold, albeit not significantly different from controls [42] . Another experimental clinical study of sleep deprivation does not alter somatosensory (nonnociceptive) functions [39] . Furthermore, the effects of interruptions of SWS increases sensitivity to both painful and nonpainful stimuli, such as bright light, loud sounds, and strong odors [40] .

Furthermore, specific dysfunctions in neurotransmitter functions are shown to contribute to bodily sensitivity and disordered sleep. For example, inhibition of serotonin (5HT) synthesis by p-chlorophenylalanine induces insomnia and a hyperalgesic state in animals and humans [54] . The increased levels of SP that are found in the CSF of FMS patients led to experimental studies that demonstrated that SP operates through a neurokinin (NK) pathway to influence nociception and sleep. Intracerebral ventricular administration of SP in sufficient quantities that did not induce nociceptive response in mice delayed onset of sleep and provoked awakenings from sleep. An NK-1 receptor antagonist reversed the interfering effect upon sleep by SP [55] . This research demonstrates that the blocking of the SP-induced insomnia by prior treatment of the mice with NK1 receptor antagonist provides support to the notion of the arousing effect of increased SP on the sleeping/waking brain.

Examples include industrial or motor vehicle accidents, psychologically traumatic events (e.g., posttraumatic stress injury), and viral infection with a consequent chronic M.E. or post viral CFS, e.g., post-viral SARS [6] .
