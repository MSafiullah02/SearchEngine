Optimization using genetic algorithm was used to determine the optimal solutions. Our results suggest the best-case strategy for S\u00e3o Paulo is to maintain or increase the current magnitude of social distancing for at least 60 more days and increase the current levels of personal protection behaviors by a minimum of 10% (e.g., wearing facemasks, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration). Followed by a long-term oscillatory level of social distancing with a steppingdown approach every 80 days over a period of two years with continued protective behavior.",

Most countries, including Brazil, have implemented widespread social distancing (SD) restrictions in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. It appears, from updated models, that these strategies have effectively reduced the number of cases and associated deaths compared to earlier predictions 3 . However, a new report indicated that SD measures in Brazil have not been as effective at reducing the reproduction number (R0) as it has in other countries 4 . R0 represents the average number of secondary cases that result from the introduction of a single infectious case in a susceptible population 5 . The R0 for Brazil is 2.81, while the R0 for China, for example, dropped to below 1 with SD measures in place 6 . A R0 = 2.81 indicates that Brazil has not controlled the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, Brazil is the new virus hot spot with the highest infection and death counts in Latin America, with the State of S\u00e3o Paulo considered one of the main hotspot 6 . S\u00e3o Paulo is the most poulous state in Brazil with over 46 million inhabitants. Therefore, exploring alternative SD intervention strategies for Brazil in general and S\u00e3o Paulo specifically is of utmost importance.",

For example, research has indicated the older adults (60+) are at the greatest risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19 7 . Given that Brazil has a large percentage of its population over the age of 60 years, especially in urban areas such as S\u00e3o Paulo, the incidence of aggravated cases may be particularly high in comparison to places with younger population demographics 8 . It has also been debated whether environmental conditions influence the behavior of the COVID-19 virus similar to the common cold and flu 9, 10 . Yet, the majority of the research investigating the virus has been conducted in environments different/opposite than that of Brazil and other areas in the southern hemisphere. In addition, Brazil faces many economical and sociocultural challenges that may affect mitigation strategies differently than cities, states, and/ or countries that are the current focus of most prediction models 8 . Therefore, the purpose of the current investigation is to model COVID-19 SD intervention strategies on transmission dynamics in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and to determine best-case scenarios.",

Our models indicate that if SD and personal protection measures are stopped too soon or reduced too much after the containment of the first peak, a second peak in infections and associated deaths will occur. Many experts agree that a secondary pandemic wave is likely if SD restrictions are lifted too quickly 22, 23 . Therefore, determining when and how to relax restrictions has become the focus of epidemiological work around the world. It has been proposed that a responsible exit strategy should continue SD restrictions alongside widespread testing and contract tracing 24 . Nevertheless, our models suggest it is possible for Brazil, considering S\u00e3o Paulo as a model state, to avoid a second peak. According to our results, the best-case exit strategy to prevent a second peak in S\u00e3o Paulo was a stepping-down strategy over a two-year period. A stepping-down approach would involve a gradual stair-step down. For example, the steppingdown approach we modeled multiplied SD values of 40%, 30% and 20% by 1, then 1/2, then 1/4, then 1/8 and then back to 1 and the we repeated each stair-step down. A stepping-down strategy was also the best-case exit strategy modeled for the US 15 . A stepping-down approach may be beneficial because it allows for periods of transmission leading to heard immunity without overwhelming public health resources 14, 25 . Alternatively, a one-time SD may result in a catastrophic second peak (Figure 1 , yellow curve), if the virus reoccurred and not enough people have immunity 14, 25 . In addition, the stepping-down approach resulted in a 6.5% reduction in total time required to SD over the two-year period, potentially reducing the economic and social costs associated with SD.",

Furthermore, strategies were compared using similar average SD across time; note however, that for because of its design when intermittent and stepping down strategies have the same maximum SD, and when adopting half of this values for the constant SD strategy, average SD values across time tends to be 6.25% smaller for the stepping-down strategy compared to the other two.

This protection rate was introduced to account for possible decreases in the number of susceptible people to the virus caused by factors other than social distancing such as the use of facemasks and hand washing. Exposed people become infectious after an incubation time of 1/\u03b3 (Equation 4). Infected people stay infected for a period of 1/\u03b4 and can recover with no medical attention (m) or can be hospitalized (1-m). Hospitalized people (Equation 5) stay hospitalized for 1/\u03b6 days and can either recover (1-c) or become critical (c) needing to go to an Intensive care unit (ICU). A person stays on average 1/ \u03b5 in the ICU (Equation 6) and can either go back to the hospital (1-f) or die (f; Equation 7).
