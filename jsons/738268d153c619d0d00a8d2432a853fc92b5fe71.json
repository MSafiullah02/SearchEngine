This work presents a novel mathematical modeling framework that integrates both outbreak dynamics and outbreak control into a decision support tool for mitigating infectious disease pandemics that spread through passenger air travel. An ensemble of border control strategies that exploit properties of the air traffic network structure and expected outbreak behavior are proposed. A stochastic metapopulation epidemic model is developed to evaluate and rank the control strategies based on their effectiveness in reducing the spread of outbreaks. sensitivity analyses are conducted to illustrate the robustness of the proposed control strategies across a range of outbreak scenarios, and a case study is presented for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. This study highlights the importance of strategically allocating outbreak control resources, and the results can be used to identify the most robust border control policy that can be implemented in the early stages of an outbreak.",

For this reason, resilience management for outbreaks has attracted a growing body of literature, both from epidemic modelers and the optimization and control community.

At a global scale, passenger air travel is known to play a critical role in the spread of infectious disease 16, 27, [38] [39] [40] [41] . Additionally, border control has been shown to play a pivotal role in mitigating epidemics, especially during the emerging stage of outbreaks 5,42-45 .

In this work we present a novel mathematical modeling framework that integrates both outbreak dynamics and outbreak control into a decision-support tool for mitigating infectious disease pandemics at the onset of an outbreak through border control. The border control mechanism considered in this work is passenger screening upon arrival at airports (entry screening), which is used to identify infected or at-risk individuals and provide immediate treatment and isolation to reduce the risk of further transmission 47 . The uncertainty of exit screening effectiveness in other countries combined with the possible development of symptoms during a flight 48 has prompted several governments to deem entry screening as crucial to the protection of their countries 49 , and further motivates its use in this study. The proposed model seeks to determine the optimal set of airports that should be allocated screening resources (technology and personnel), and the corresponding amount (thus dictating the proportion of arriving passengers that can be screened) such that the outbreak risk is minimized. We propose an ensemble of control strategies that exploit the heterogeneity of the air traffic network structure and outputs from an outbreak simulation model in the allocation of control resources. We evaluate each control strategy using a stochastic metapopulation epidemic model, and compare the strategies based on their effectiveness in reducing the spread of outbreaks. Note that we are not proposing or evaluating air travel restrictions, which have substantial economic costs as well as recognized limitations in their ability to prevent or reduce the scale of pandemics 24, 33, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . The goal of the proposed decision-support framework is to optimize the use of airport screening for border control to minimize the harm, i.e., number of infected persons and cities, posed by the introduction of a new disease into susceptible cities, thus providing local public health authorities more time to plan, prepare and distribute local control strategies, e.g., anti-virals, vaccines, source exit screening etc., which must be rapidly administered if/when infection is introduced.",

In this section, we present both the stochastic metapopulation epidemic model used to simulate outbreak dynamics, and its integration within the proposed decision-support framework. Our metapopulation model is based on a global air travel network which connects local, city-level, populations. Formally, the proposed metapopulation network can be represented by a graph G = (V, E) where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of directed edges in the network. Nodes represent cities and edges represent passenger travel routes, possibly including stopovers, among cities. At each node of the network, we locally model outbreak dynamics using a discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model 57 . The time steps are set to be t \u2208 T = {1, 2, \u2026, t obs } where t obs is the time step where the state of the outbreak is being evaluated. Local and global outbreak dynamics models are coupled by indexing compartmental states by network nodes \u2208 i V and time steps t. Specifically, we denote S i,t , E i,t , I i,t and R i,t the susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered compartments at node i at time t. Because our focus is on the early stages of an outbreak (e.g., weeks or months), we assume that nodes have time-independent populations and we denote N i the population at node i \u2208 V. We use this metapopulation model to capture day-to-day global travel dynamics, wherein the time steps are assumed to be of the order of magnitude of a day in length, which is consistent with other studies that simulate infectious diseases dynamics at a global scale 31, 35, 36, 43 .",

We denote x i,t \u2208 [0, 1] the control rate at node i at time step t. Control variables can be incorporated in the proposed metapopulation epidemic model by re-defining Eqs (1c) and (1d) as follows: This formulation is able to capture the combined effects of screening passengers at multiple nodes along their travel route. The combination of Eqs (1a), (1b), (3c) and (3d), hereby to as (3), can be viewed as a control-driven stochastic metapopulation epidemic model wherein variables x i,t represent the level of control over time space in the network. An illustration of the combined effect of node controls along a path with stop-overs is provided in the Supplementary Material (Section A). A control rate of less than one can be interpreted as shortcomings of the methods or technology involved with screening. We assume that passengers coming into a controlled airport who are successfully identified as infected individuals are isolated for treatment, and hence are no longer able to spread infection. In terms of the model, infected individuals screened at a controlled node are assumed to transition to the recovered state R. The main objective function is to minimize the expected cumulative number of infected individuals at the observation time 31 . This can be stated as follows:",

At each iteration, the algorithm picks the next node i of the sorted set and determines whether this node can be fully controlled (x i = 1) without exceeding the available budget B. Variable U represents the consumed budget. If the node can be fully controlled, the consumed budget is incremented by s i + g s (1) which corresponds to the cost of control for x i = 1. Otherwise, the algorithm checks whether node i can be partially controlled: this is possible only if there is enough budget remaining to cover the node setup cost s i . If this is possible, the remaining budget is depleted and used to deploy control resources at node i. The control level of node i is determined by taking the inverse of the variable cost function g s (x i ) corresponding to the remaining budget available, i.e. B \u2212 U \u2212 s i .

As expected, when no control is deployed (Panel A), there are substantially more cities affected than there are under any of the control strategies considered (Panels B-F). While both MC/EP and MT (Panels B and E, respectively) control relatively few and more spatially sparse airports, EP (Panel B) provides substantially greater reduction in both the outbreak size and number of affected cities (as depicted in Figs. 1 and 2) due to the strategic nature of the path-based metric. In contrast, MT (Panel E) is the second worst performing strategy, and spends large portions of its budget on controlling fewer, more heavily travelled airports, which may not play a critical role in the early stages of the outbreak. The poorest performing strategy is LP (Panel F), which, perhaps surprisingly, controls more airports than all other strategies. However, many of these airports are far-removed from the outbreak source in terms of traffic volumes, and are therefore less likely to contribute to spread early in the outbreak. Strategy 1C (Panel C) suffers from similar faults, indicating that budget is spent on airports that are less expensive to control, but also provide less overall impact.

We present an ensemble of control strategies that are evaluated based on their ability to reduce the cumulative number of cases and the number of cities infected at a target observation time. The decision-support framework provided can be implemented in real-time at the early stages of a confirmed or suspected outbreak. An in-depth analysis is presented for multiple Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:2216 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38665-w hypothetical outbreak scenarios, and a case study is conducted to illustrate the performance of the control strategies for an outbreak similar to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Further, extensive sensitivity analysis illustrates the robustness of the control strategies to various modelling parameters and assumptions. The best performing control strategies are the network-driven strategies, e.g., EP and MC, which are shown to be robust across a range of outbreak scenarios and model assumptions. In contrast, the more simplistic strategies, e.g., controlling the most travelled airports (MT) or the airports in the largest cities (LP), perform the poorest. The superiority of the network-driven strategies highlights the significance of the heterogeneity of the world air traffic network in outbreak spreading 5, 16 , which can be exploited by policy makers for the purposes of pandemic planning and mitigation. The two control strategies informed by simulation, 1OU and 1C, rank in the middle in terms of performance in most scenarios considered in this work, however the relative performance of the strategies is sensitive to the outbreak initial conditions, as highlighted by the case study. While the results from the analysis presented indicate the EP strategy to be reliably superior, the larger contribution of this work is the modeling framework, which can be implemented in real-time for any outbreak scenario given reported case counts and locations. Additionally, the integrated framework is flexible, and can be easily extended to incorporate and compare the performance of additional strategies if desired. The cost-benefit analysis highlights two critical issues. Firstly, a given budget can be used more effectively if the control decisions are made strategically. e.g., EP/MC can achieve the same effectiveness as MT/LP for nearly half the budget. Second, there is evidence of decreasing marginal returns for the superior strategies, indicating minimal benefits may be gained by spending more on border control beyond a certain threshold. This cost-effectiveness threshold is critical for policy makers, who can choose to redirect available control resources towards alternative control strategies for outbreak mitigation which may be more effective.",

Furthermore, the control strategies are observed to be more effective (relative to the no control scenario) and more robust for faster spreading viruses. The more reliable performance for higher contact rates can be attributed to the highly stochastic nature of outbreaks in their early stages, which is heavily dependent on where the first few infected cases spread to, whereas a faster spreading virus will result in a larger number of infected people travelling, reducing the variability across outbreak scenarios. Sensitivity to observation time and control start date was conducted to illustrate the impact of these two implementation options available to policy makers. The model appears to be highly sensitive to observation time (see Section C.2), which is due to the exponential nature of outbreak growth; there is a small number of cases and affected cities in the early stages of the outbreaks (e.g. 25 days) compared to considerably higher infection rates at later time epochs (e.g. 100 days). This sensitivity analysis highlights the critical (short) timeline during which border control has the potential to play a substantial role, after which local control will be most impactful. The impact of delaying border control was also evaluated (Section C.3), and the results again highlight the robustness of the strategy rankings. The results also demonstrate the importance of implementing control in a timely fashion, with the best performing strategies revealed to be the most sensitive to delayed start times.",

This work assumes that outgoing screening at the source is an obvious decision; therefore the model addresses the more challenging problem of selecting which locations other than the source(s) should be prioritized for incoming passenger screening. The sensitivity analysis results reveal that when outgoing screening is implemented at the source (Section C.5) the proposed control strategies behave predictably, i.e., the outbreak spreads faster but the strategy rankings remain consistent. Critically, the best performing strategies perform well even at low levels of outgoing screening, i.e., ineffective screening, while the poorest performing strategies are more sensitive to the effectiveness of outgoing source screening. Lastly, there are modeling assumptions and limitations of this study. First, the model only accounts for passenger air travel, and excludes mobility within and between cities via other modes of transport. Second, local disease spread (within a city) is modeled deterministically, and a uniform contact rate is used across all populations. Third, the model is currently limited to global control decisions through passenger screening, and does not evaluate local control mechanisms (prophylaxtics, vaccines, school closures, etc), with the exception of source exit screening. Fourth, airport (rather than route) screening rates are the control variable, and therefore assume passenger screening to be uniformly applied across all incoming routes at a given airport. Planned extensions of this work will address these limitations through i) integrating alternative modes of transport into the model, ii) adding additional decision variables to optimize local control decisions, iii) the development of a link-based modelling formulation to allow specific travel routes to be identified for screening (as opposed to airports), and iv) introducing a dynamic resource allocation formulation which relaxes the assumption of constant control across the entire planning period. These extensions would provide more degrees of freedom to improve the impact of control resources and further help in minimizing the risk posed by global outbreaks. The set of limitations and extensions listed currently lie outside the scope of this study, and provide the basis for future research.",

These results have valuable implications for policy makers, and indicate the potentially cost-effective nature of resource allocation if assigned strategically. Case Study: 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic. To illustrate the ability of the simulation model to replicate a realistic pandemic, we consider the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic as a case study, and quantify the performance of the proposed strategies under similar outbreak conditions. The simulation model was calibrated to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak data at both the U.S. and global scales. The calibration methodology and results are included in the Supplementary Material (Section D). The final calibrated disease parameters are \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 0.475, \u03b3 = 0.25 and \u03bb = 1. For all simulations the starting date of the outbreak is set as the 5 th of February 2009 with 1 infected individual placed into the city of Veracruz, Mexico 1 . Each control strategy is deployed four weeks (28 days) after the first case appeared in Mexico, at which time there were about 100 local cases in Mexico (based on the simulation). The cost function, budget and screening costs are the same as those used in the base case analysis. The results are based on 1,000 simulations of the stochastic model, and the observation time is set to t obs = 100 days after the first case.",
