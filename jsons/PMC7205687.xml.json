The conventional stroke code process focuses on rapid stroke team mobilization.2 Standardized pathways for the use of healthcare resources, including personnel and personal protective equipment (PPE), are necessary to prevent depletion of assets and worsening of the crisis. This has also been seen in settings such as STEMI care in areas that have been affected by COVID-19 for longer periods of time.3 The American Stroke Association has provided emergency guidance for overall hyperacute treatment of stroke during this crisis and individual institutions must devise emergency care pathways that provide systematic guidance to all members of the stroke team.4 The purpose of this manuscript is to outline a stroke code and stroke care model developed by the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Stroke Center during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis to protect healthcare providers, preserve limited PPE, and provide rapid, comprehensive stroke care.",

However, the traditional in-person model of response to stroke code activation has previously and preferentially been utilized in our academic CSCs. The field of telemedicine has evolved rapidly since the COVID-19 pandemic. We are considering every aspect of patient care to reduce transmission and preserve PPE. Within one week of the declared crisis at UCSD, we deployed the use of internal telestroke evaluations in our CSCs. UCSD Information Services configured and deployed telemedicine carts (camera, monitor, microphone, speaker, and video codec or computer on a moveable system). Emergency Department (ED) Nurses and staff were educated about the telemedicine system and instructed on the COVID-19 adapted stroke code model (Fig 1\n) via centralized education by the ED nurse management team. Continued education was done with each stroke code activation. Each case is directed by a Stroke Provider, First Responder with Vascular Neurology faculty supervision (see role below). Our long-standing telemedicine program and expertise allowed for rapid deployment of this modality in our CSC. Hyperacute telestroke evaluations reduce exposure for clinicians and preserve the scarce supply of PPE.",

Adapted in-person response to stroke code activation is included in the model for systems without access to telemedicine or for technical failures.

If there is a \u201cyes\u201d answer to any screening question, all stroke code team members are notified that the patient is COVID-19 screen positive per the stroke code paging system. PPE per guidelines (Fig 2) is used prior to any contact with the patient and is based on aerosolization risk. For in-person management, the SPFR maintains a six foot distance from the patient except for necessary physical examination for acute stroke such as grip strength or sensation exam. A National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and stroke-specific physical exam is performed, as much of this exam can be reliably done from a distance. The patient is taken for brain imaging by the SPFR and bedside nurse in appropriate PPE. CT or MRI technicians are alerted as to the COVID- 19 status of the patient so that they may use appropriate PPE per CDC guidelines and implement the appropriate decontamination protocols once the patient leaves the scanner. The imaging machines, beds, and any other equipment used are currently cleaned after each patient use with disinfecting bleach wipes. After imaging, the patient returns to where the stroke code originated. The SPFR concurrently makes the treatment decision and proceeds per American Stroke Association and internal hospital guidelines.6 In thrombolysis cases, the Pharmacist prepares the bolus and infusion, places the medications no less than six feet away from the patient and has no physical contact with the SPFR, patient, or stroke code Nurse. In endovascular treatment, the Endovascular team is informed of COVID-19 status via the stroke code paging system and PPE is used per guidelines (Fig 2).",

A single bolus of TNK (0.25mg/kg IV maximum dose 25mg) may be reasonable in patients within 4.5 hours of onset or LKW, no contraindications to IV fibrinolysis, and anterior circulation large vessel or basilar artery occlusion9 (Class Of Recommendation IIb, Level of Evidence B-R). TNK as a 0.4mg/kg single bolus has some guideline support in minor neurologic impairment with no large vessel occlusion (LVO)6 (Class Of Recommendation IIb, Level of Evidence B-R). The frequency of neurologic and vital signs checks post-TNK are the same as post rt-PA treatment and therefore do not reduce the burden on nursing staff.9 Given the class of recommendation and level of evidence, the UCSD Stroke Center has maintained Alteplase as the standard of care for acute stroke treatment at this time. It is important that centers that choose TNK monitor patient outcomes during this time to provide more evidence for this therapy.",

After the procedure, the suite requires disinfecting via Environmental Health Services for a duration of \u223c30 minutes. This process is done per institutional guidelines. UC San Diego has four total dedicated bi-plane neuro-interventional suites and access to over 10 single plane suites. This allows for flexibility of procedure location during the times of suite cleaning. In the event that all suites are unavailable for >30 minutes, the patient would be transferred to the nearest CSC with interventional capabilities (approx. 5 minutes from each center). The engagement of regional Primary and Comprehensive Stroke Center Directors, Stroke Coordinators, and Pre-hospital officials is vital to ensure that transfers are rapid during this pandemic. A plan should be devised in each region to expedite stroke transfers among institutions.",

The median door to needle time (DTN) at UCSD through December 2019 was 37 minutes and Door to groin puncture (DTG) was 36 minutes in telestroke transfers and 82 minutes in hospital arrivals. We have treated three patients with rt-PA since we implemented the adapted COVID-19 stroke code model. These cases had DTN times of 26 (EMS arrival), 38 (EMS arrival), and 59 (private car arrival) minutes. For the 59 minute DTN, the documented delay involved managing nausea/vomiting in CT scanner and a comprehensive discussion with the patient and family due to thrombocytopenia. One patient was treated with endovascular therapy in the 6-24 hour window with a DTG time of 24 minutes. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital after telestroke evaluation and the ET was pre-notified of the arrival. All team members donned PPE prior to the patient arrival. All four treated patients were initially screened as COVID-19 negative and did not subsequently become positive or display symptoms. Time metrics are being closely monitored in ambulance, private car/walk-up, and transfer patients.
