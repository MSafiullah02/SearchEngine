She had a history of recent travel from Wuhan, China, the center of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), to Shanghai one day before admission. On physical sedimentation rate (ESR) of 67 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 57.7 mg/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed multiple ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Fig. 1 ). Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase (RT-PCR) chain reaction assay of the specimen collected form the patient's throat was positive for the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SHPHCC), the designated hospital, for further treatment. She had a satisfactory response to the medical treatment and was discharged upon recovery two weeks after the onset of illness.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] Additional features, such as nodular, reticular, peripheral opacities and crazy-paving patterns may be helpful in early diagnosis. 4 Importantly, early diagnosis is beneficial to the patients and the public health surveillance and response systems.",
