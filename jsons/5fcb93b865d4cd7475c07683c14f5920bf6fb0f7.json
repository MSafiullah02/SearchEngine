Recent studies have shown that vitamin B1 (V B1 ) and vitamin C (Vc) can inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth, but the precise mechanism is still not well understood. In the present study, we have used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to analyze the transcriptional, metabolic and methylation profiles of Mycobacterium bovis BCG when treated with V B1 and Vc. Our results show that, after vitamin treatment, variant metabolites were mainly clustered in pathways related to amino acid metabolism. Treatment with both vitamins significantly up-regulated the gene encoding cysteine synthase A. Additionally, only BCG that was treated with V C showed m4c modifications. Genes harboring this methylation were up-regulated, suggesting that m4c methylation can promote gene transcription to some extent. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the effects of V B1 and V C , and suggests that these vitamins constitute potential anti-tuberculosis drugs.",

Mtb is able to persist in the host for decades without causing clinical symptoms, and has evolved adaptation mechanisms to survive in the harsh environment of the host, such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation or low pH (Betts et al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2002; Schnappinger et al., 2003) . This adaptation is possible by regulation of gene expression, which in turn can be controlled by DNA methylation (Shell et al., 2013) .",

Although adenine is the most important methylation target, e.g., N 6methyl-adenosine (m6A), there are other two types of methylation. These are found in cytosine and depend on the modification site: m4C (N 4 -methyl-cytosine) and m5C (C 5 -methyl-cytosine) (Murphy et al., 2013) . In general, m6A has been used as the main signal for epigenetic regulation in bacteria, m5C has been mainly described in mammals and plant studies (Kim et al., 2009) , whereas m4C is mainly present in bacteria (Kumar et al., 2018) .",

Even when they are produced, concentrations are low and external supplementation from the diet or from commensal bacteria is required. Vitamins have been found to regulate immunity, and a number of studies have reported the effect of vitamins as adjunct to treat tuberculosis (Parida et al., 2015; He et al., 2018) . For example, vitamins A, C and D have been used as adjunct to complement anti-tuberculosis drugs (Dini and Bianchi, 2012; Vilcheze et al., 2013; Syal et al., 2015) . The active form of thiamin (Vitamin B1, V B1 ), thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) (Begley et al., 1999; Settembre et al., 2003; Pohl et al., 2004) , is an essential cofactor in all organisms, taking an important role in energy metabolism and degradation of sugars. In addition, V B1 plays an important role in the activation of the immune system, nerve tissue repair, neuronal communication and cell-membrane dynamics (Gibson and Blass, 2007; Manzetti et al., 2014) . Recent studies have shown the effects of V B1 both in vitro and in vivo; V B1 inhibits in vitro growth of BCG with an MIC of 8 mM, whereas it limits Mtb in vivo growth by regulating innate immunity in a peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor \u03b3-dependent manner Song et al., 2019) . V C also can hamper the growth of Mtb by a mechanism that involves the reduction of ferric to ferrous ion and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species (i.e., hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals) through Harber-Weiss cycle and Fenton reactions (Vilcheze et al., 2013) . BCG is also sensitive to Vc, with an MIC is 0.8 mM (Pei et al., 2019) .",

By studying the complete set of metabolites within a microorganism and monitoring the global outcome of interactions between its development processes and the environment, metabolomics can potentially provide a more accurate snap shot of the actual physiological state of the cell. Furthermore, when these data are interpreted in combination with genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics data and so on, using what is termed a systems biology approach, a more holistic understanding of these systems can be achieved. Up to now, the metabolomics has contributed to characterize Mtb in terms of metabolism, growth and replication, pathogenicity, and drug resistance, from the perspective of systems biology (Swanepoel and Loots, 2014) . For example, Meissner-Roloff compared the metabolomes of a hypo-and hyper-virulent Beijing Mtb strain and subsequently identified a reduction in various metabolite markers in the relatively hyper-virulent strain (Meissner-Roloff et al., 2012) . Loots used metabolomics approach to identify potentially new metabolic pathways and metabolite markers to explain many of the phenotypical characteristics associated with a katG mutation and the resulting isoniazid-resistance in Mtb (Loots du, 2014). Additionally, metabolomics was to identify individual metabolites or metabolite profiles that could be used as biomarkers of early MAP (Mycobacterium avium subsp. Paratuberculosis) infection in ruminants (De Buck et al., 2014) .",

DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation are tightly related and play an important role in the epigenetics of living organisms, whereas vitamins have an anti-tuberculosis effect.

RNA-seq was performed as described (Song et al., 2019) on three replicates of bacteria treated with V B1 and V C . Cell pellets were lysed and homogenized by high-speed agitation in a bead mill in presence of glass beads and lysis buffer. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions with one on-column DNase I treatment (Qiagen) at 37 \u2022 C for 30 min, in order to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. DNase I was removed with RNeasy mini kit, according to the clean-up procedure (Song et al., 2019) . The RNA integrity number (RIN) was used to inspect RNA integrity by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). The concentration of RNA samples was determined with a NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer. The strand-specific library was constructed using TruSeq R Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, United States). The ribosomal RNA was removed and the RNA fragments were cleaved, whereas the first and second strand cDNA were synthesized. A single ' A' nucleotide was added to the 3 ends of the blunt DNA fragments with repaired ends, and subsequently connected with adapters. The purified libraries were quantified using Qubit R 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, United States) and validated by Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, United States), in order to measure concentration and confirm insert size. The cluster was generated by cBot, and RNA sequencing was performed using a 150 bp pair-end strategy with the Illumina Hiseq X10 platform (Illumina, United States) to generate three billion bases per sample. Thereafter, raw data was acquired, followed by pretreatment using Septk1. The read length was > 90 nt. The clean reads were mapped to the Mycobacterium bovis BCG str.

There were 19 unique m6A sites in V B1 -treated BCG, but only one of them was located within the coding region of significantly down-regulated genes, away from the promoter region. For the 20 unique m6A sites in V C -treated BCG, two were located in the promoter region of significantly up-regulated genes (Supplementary Table 11) . In that sample, m4C was found in the coding region of 31 down-regulated genes (47.7%) and 138 up-regulated genes (64.8%) (Supplementary Table 11) , but it was observed in the promoter region only in 11 up-regulated genes (Supplementary Table 12 ). These results suggest that gene expression is not affected when methylation is in the coding region, but when m4C is located in the promoter region it contributes to upregulate BCG gene expression. To validate this hypothesis, we compared the gene expression levels of methylated and non-methylated genes, based on their FPKM. Although no significant changes were observed for m6A-modified genes (Supplementary Figure 2) , the expression levels of 65 genes harboring m4C sites in the promoter region was significantly higher than in the control that had no m4C sites (mean FPKM = 272.3 and 222.9, respectively and p < 0.05) (see Supplementary Figure 3 ).",

Another significantly down-regulated gene was chorismate mutase [5.4.99.5] (Supplementary Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 10), which catalyzes the transformation from chorismate to prephenate, the precursor of phenylalanine and tyrosine. This is consistent with the observed 80% reduction in Phe and Tyr after V B1 addition. This treatment also caused almost 50% reduction in alanine, although the gene expression of alanine dehydrogenase [1.4.1.1] showed no significant down-regulation.

L-asparaginase [3.5.1.1], which converts Asn to Asp, increased 2-fold after V C addition (Supplementary Table 10) .

The tryptophan synthase [4.2.1.20] gene was also significantly down-regulated (Supplementary Figure 6) , consistent with the reduction of Trp in these conditions. Strikingly, the cysteine synthase A [2.5.1.47] gene was significantly up-regulated in BCG treated with either V B1 or Vc (Supplementary Figures 5, 6) . Finally, we found no direct association between base modification in coding or promoter regions and expression of genes involved in amino acid metabolism (Supplementary Table 10) . Taken together, we found significant regulation of several genes directly involved in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, consistent with amino acid content changes.

In the present study, we found that 138 genes (64.8%) harboring m4C in the coding region, and 11 genes harboring m4C in the promoter region, were up-regulated in Vc-treated BCG. Additionally, 65 genes that harbored m4C sites in the promoter region showed expression levels significantly higher than the control (no m4C sites), based on FPKM values. This suggests that m4C can promote gene transcription to some extent, but using mechanisms that are still unknown. The m4C modification was observed in type I R-M systems, suggesting that, in addition to m6A modifications, they can also use this modification for host protection (Morgan et al., 2016) .",

Rv3130c (JTY_RS16210) encodes a triacylglycerol synthase that synthesizes triacylglycerol. This is proposed as an energy source during dormancy, and its disruption prevents triacylglycerol accumulation under inducing conditions (Sirakova et al., 2006) . Rv2626c (JTY_RS13655) plays a significant role in macrophage pro-inflammatory response and in mycobacterial survival during infection (Sun et al., 2017) . Rv0256c (JTY_RS01360), which can be used as a potential marker for the serodiagnosis of tuberculosis patients, may inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production in activated macrophages (Bhat et al., 2013; Abraham et al., 2014) . Rv1187 (JTY_RS06330), encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, was shown to be involved in the prolineutilization pathway in Mtb, and this pathway could be a valuable therapeutic target against TB (Jena et al., 2015) .

Recent studies found that tryptophan synthase which catalyzes the final step in tryptophan biosynthesis is one potentially novel anti-tubercular drug target (Abrahams et al., 2017) . In addition, treatment with 6-FABA 2-amino-6-fluoro-benzoic acid (6-FABA) chemically induces Mtb tryptophan auxotrophy. Together with immune-mediated trypothan starvation, this results in mycobacterial death.

Inosine has been reported to exert nutritional and neuroprotective functions in nerve cells, and stimulates mast cell degranulation by activating adenosine A3 receptor (Jin et al., 1997) . Moreover, inosine exhibits antiinflammatory activity by inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokine from activated T cells and promoting the formation of IL-10. Clinical trials have proposed that the use of inosine to raise serum urate levels may have benefits for at least some multiple sclerosis patients. The effect of this treatment is likely to be a consequence of inactivation of peroxynitrite-dependent free radicals (Markowitz et al., 2009) . NAD(P) is an indispensable cofactor for all organisms and its biosynthetic pathways are proposed as promising novel antibiotics targets against pathogens such as Mtb. It is reported that NAD(P) play the import role in immune response, gene silencing, DNA repair, regulation, redox reaction, energy and cellular metabolism which participate in more than 300 biochemical reactions, amounting to 17% of all the classical reaction (You, 1985; Bi et al., 2011) . Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is essential for a variety of organisms, and it is both a coenzyme for hydride-transfer enzymes and a substrate for NAD+-consuming enzymes, such as ADPribose transferases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, cADP-ribose synthases, and sirtuins.",

It has been reported that isoniazid (INH)/Cys combination potentiates the killing of Mtb by stimulating respiration of Mtb from non-respiring dormancy (Vilcheze et al., 2017) . High levels of intracellular cysteine can induce ROS production, causing DNA damage and oxidation of cysteine to cystine in E. coli (Park and Imlay, 2003) . Indeed, transition metals, such as copper or iron, catalyze the oxidation of cysteine into cystine, leading to the production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals (Kachur et al., 1999) .
