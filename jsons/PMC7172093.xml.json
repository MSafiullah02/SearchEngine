            "text": "Hepadnaviruses (family Hepadnaviridae) are partially double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses that replicate their DNA by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate (Urban et al., 2010). At present, the family contains two genera -Avihepadnavirus, Orthohepadnavirus- as well as one floating virus, White sucker hepatitis B virus, sampled from a fish (https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy). Recently, two additional hepadnaviruses were identified in fish and frogs and await classification (Dill et al., 2016). Hepadnaviruses possess very small (3.0\u20133.3 kb) partially dsDNA genomes that exhibit a circular conformation by base pairing in a cohesive overlap between the 5\u2019 ends of the two DNA strands (Seeger et al., 2013). The orthohepadnavirus genome contains four overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the viral polymerase (P), core (C), surface (S), and X proteins, while the genus Avihepadnavirus lacks the ORF X. Hepadnaviruses are well known because the prototype virus of the family, human hepatitis B virus (HBV), causes around 250 million chronic infections worldwide and at least 887,000 deaths each year (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en).",

Although hepadnaviruses were discovered in ground squirrels (genus Marmota) in the USA (Summers et al., 1978; Marion et al., 1980; Testut et al., 1996), they have been not observed in other rodents or in other geographic localities. Notably, however, orthohepadnaviruses have recently been identified in both Old and New World bats: specifically, long-fingered bat HBV (LBHBV) in Miniopterus fuliginosus from Myanmar (He et al., 2013), tent-making bat hepatitis B virus (TBHBV) in Uroderma bilobatum from Panama, roundleaf bat HBV (RBHBV) and horseshoe bat HBV (HBHBV) in Hipposideros cf. ruber and Rhinolophus alcyone from Gabon (Drexler et al., 2013), and HBHBV-like viruses in H. pomona, R. affinis and R. sinicus from Yunnan province, China (He et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017a). These results suggest that bats may be important natural hosts for hepadnaviruses.",

In addition, ancient endogenous hepadnaviruses have been identified in a diverse range of vertebrates (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010, Gilbert and Feschotte, 2010, Cui et al., 2014). Importantly, bat hepadnaviruses occupy diverse positions in the orthohepadnavirus phylogeny (Rasche et al., 2016), indicative of multiple cross-species transmission events. Indeed, TBHBVs harbored by tent-making bats from Panama form a sister-group to all known orthohepadnaviruses and can infect human hepatocytes (Drexler et al., 2013). However, because hepadnaviruses have only been identified in a narrow range of animal hosts, the origin and evolutionary history of these important mammalian viruses are unclear.",

In the P gene tree (\nFig. 2), all known orthohepadnaviruses including the bat viruses newly identified here fell into five clades. Bat viruses comprised clades I, IV and V, while primate and rodent viruses formed the clades II and III, respectively. All the bat viruses newly identified here fell into clade V. This clade, comprising only hepadnaviruses from the Old World, was further divided into two phylogenetic groups. The first group could be further separated into six lineages (denoted A-F), highlighting the extensive diversity of bat hepadnaviruses. The viruses in these lineages, which were identified in M. schreibersii and M. davidii bats sampled from Anlong (Guizhou province) and M. schreibersii, R. pearsonii, and R. pusillus from Neixiang (Henan province), formed a distinct lineage (denoted A) and possessed 99.4\u2013100% nucleotide identity. Both lineages C and E were sampled in Longquan in Zhejiang province, and found in R. sinicus and H. armiger bats, respectively. Strikingly, lineage F comprised viruses identified in eight bat species from three families (Miniopteridae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae) at all investigating sites, with 95.5\u2013100% nucleotide identity. In addition, this group contained two other lineages (B and D) comprising viruses previously sampled from roundleaf bats (H. pomona) and horseshoe bats (R. affinis and R. sinicus) in Yunnan province, China (He et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017a). The nucleotide differences between the six lineages ranged from 77.4% to 92.8%. Remarkably, within the second group, the bat viruses identified in R. ferrumequinum from Jiyuan in Henan province formed a sister group to viruses identified in horseshoe (R. alcyone) and roundleaf (H. cf. ruber) bats sampled from Gabon in West Africa (Drexler et al., 2013). The newly identified viruses exhibited 20.3\u201320.5% nucleotide difference from the Gabonese viruses (\nTable 2). Clade V showed a sister relationship to clade IV, with the latter comprising only LBHBVs identified in M. fuliginosus sampled from Myanmar (He et al., 2013). Finally, the most divergent clade I only contained TBHBVs. In sum, these phylogenetic data reveal an evolutionary history characterized by extensive genetic diversity, frequent cross-species transmission, in situ evolution and a widespread geographic distribution (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).",

Compared with bat viruses, primate hepadnaviruses contained more amino acid deletions at positions 107\u2212158. It is believed that the N-terminal amino acid residues of large surface protein (preS1 domain) are essential for HBV infectivity (Neurath et al., 1986). Comparison of amino sequences revealed that the newly identified bat viruses had high identity within a short amino acid motif (NPLGFFPDH) that is conserved among primate viruses (\nFig. 5). In particular, virus Lushi-Rpu-157 shared the same amino acid residues as the primate hepadnaviruses, and exhibited high levels of sequence identity to primate viruses within adjacent accessory domains (motifs NPDWD and NKDHWPEANKVGVG). As the lineage including Lushi-Rpu-157 have a broad range of bat hosts and geographic distribution, further studies are needed to evaluate their infectivity in human hepatocytes. Finally, unlike the other genes, the length of X gene was shorter in bat viruses (408-435nt) and rodent viruses (417-426nt), compared to primate viruses (465 nt).",

However, there was a clear incongruence between bat hepadnaviruses and their bat hosts at the family, genus, species levels, especially for the newly identified viruses of lineage F. A similar incongruence between primate viruses and rodent viruses and their respective hosts was also evident. Combined, our co-phylogenetic analysis of orthohepadnaviruses and their hosts provided evidence for 10\u201312 co-divergence events, 23\u201325 host switches, 0 lineage duplications, 0\u20132 losses and 0 failure to diverge events (Fig. 6B). Overall, therefore, our co-phylogenetic analysis did not identify significant congruence between the phylogenetic trees of orthohepadnaviruses and their mammalian hosts (P < 0.05), although the presence of hepadnaviruses in diverse vertebrates makes it likely that these virus-host associations have been established for millions of years.

Notably, within the first group of clade V the same virus was identified in several bat species from the same geographic locality. For example, lineage A was present in four bats species from three families sampled in both Guizhou and Henan provinces (Table S1). Similarly, lineage F of group 2 was identified in 11 bat species from three families. Notably, although Anlong (Guizhou province) is > 1102 km distant from Jiyuan, Lushi and Neixiang in Henan province in central China, and from Longquan (Zhejiang province) located in the eastern costal region (> 1420 km distant), the newly identified lineage F was found in all these regions, suggesting that these viruses face relatively limited host and geographic barriers. More notable was that the viruses identified in R. ferrumequinum bats sampled from Jiyuan city (Henan province) within group 2 were more closely related to the viruses sampled from Gabon in West Africa than to Chinese bat viruses, including others from Jiyuan.

However, they were not identified in 17 bat species from Australia, Brazil, Germany and Papua New Guinea (Drexler et al., 2013). In the current study, 797bats representing 21 species from five families were captured, and hepadnaviruses were identified in all predominant species from all five locations (Table 1); this is a far bigger sample size than previous studies in China (He et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017a). Additionally, viral prevalence was high in bats from almost all sampling locations, with the exception of Lushi county in Henan province. Hence, combined with previous studies, these data indicate that bats are an important natural reservoir of orthohepadnaviruses.",

Our co-phylogenetic analysis of hepadnaviruses and their hosts revealed that the cross-species transmission of orthohepadnaviruses has occurred relatively frequently in the evolutionary history of these viruses (Fig. 6). Most notably, the same bat hepadnavirus can be recovered in multiple bat species from the same geographic locality, such as seven bat species from two families sampled in Longquan. This suggests that there are few barriers to prevent the cross-species transmission of hepadnaviruses in bats.",

            "text": "Despite this frequent cross-species transmission, the co-divergence between hepadnaviruses and their hosts was evident at the level of mammalian orders, suggesting that virus host jumping has occurred on a background of an ancient virus-host association. This is further supported by the observation that the viruses harbored by R. ferrumequinumbats from Jiyuan in Henan province were most closely related to those identified in the R. alcyone and H. cf. ruber bats sampled from Gabon in West Africa (Drexler et al., 2013) (Figs. 2 and 3). The Rhinolophidae are estimated to have diverged from the ancestor of the Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae approximately 42 million years ago during the Eocene (Foley et al., 2015). Although an African origin of the Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae was recently proposed (Foley et al., 2015), more researchers have argued for an Asian origin (Bogdanowicz and Owen, 1992, Teeling et al., 2005, Stoffberg et al., 2010, Ravel et al., 2014). In addition, the ancestor of the superfamily Noctilionoidea, to which U. bilobatum bats belong, is also likely to have originated in the Old World (Teeling et al., 2005). Thus, although the most divergent bat hepadnaviruses - the TBHBV clade - have to date only been sampled in the New World, it is possible that they are also present in the Old World. Indeed, our identification of divergent and widespread bat viruses in China indicates that the origin and evolution of orthohepadnaviruses should be interpreted with great caution.",

We reconstructed patterns of co-divergence (and consequently cross-species transmission) using arbitrary weights of 0 for co-divergence and a weight of 1 for duplication, host switching, lineage loss and failure to diverge as described previously (Geoghegan et al., 2017, Lin et al., 2017). We performed the Jane analysis with 100 generations and a population size of 100 as parameters for the genetic algorithm. To test the probability of observing the inferred number of co-divergence events by chance, we employed the random tip mapping method with the following parameters: generation number = 100, population size = 100, and sample size = 50. Finally, we used TreeMap (2.0b) to create tanglegrams of the hepadnavirus and host phylogenies as described previously (Jackson and Charleston, 2004).",
