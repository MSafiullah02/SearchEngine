Recruitment was from antenatal clinics and was progressive over 2 years, which allowed infants born between September 2010 and October 2012 to be enrolled evenly throughout the study period to account for seasonal and year-to-year variation in respiratory virus activity [25]. Consequently, symptom data and nose swab specimen collection spanned >4 years from September 2010 to October 2014. The Children\u2019s Health Queensland, Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s Hospital, and the University of Queensland Human Research Ethics Committees approved the study and parents consented antenatally for their infant to participate.",

All virus detections with cycle threshold (Ct) values \u226440 were considered positive. In addition, Ct values were used as semiquantitative markers of viral load as they are inversely proportional to the amount of specific virus nucleic acid present in the specimen [27].",

First analyzed separately, HRV, RSV, PIV, INFV, HCoV, and HPyV subtypes and species were then grouped for additional analyses. The time to fVDE and symptomatic fVDE for each virus was calculated using life tables with the day of birth as study entry time. Infants were censored at either the date of the last swab submitted if the next swab was not returned for >30 days, or at 730 days, whichever came first. The association between symptomatic/asymptomatic fVDEs and both the Ct value and length of shedding were compared using a Mann\u2013Whitney test. For clinical characteristics of fVDEs, associations between virus types and symptoms were compared using absolute risk differences for binary outcomes, and median regression for continuous outcomes. In all cases, HRV was the reference virus. The association between potential risk factors (age, sex, season, breastfeeding, childcare attendance, number of children in the household) and symptomatic fVDEs was examined for the 9 respiratory virus groups using logistic regression. Risk factors were categorized as age (0 to <3 months; 3 to <6 months; 6 to <12 months, and 12 to 24 months); sex (male, female); season (winter [June\u2013August], spring [September\u2013November], summer [December\u2013February], fall [March\u2013May]); breastfeeding (exclusively breastfed for \u22654 months, exclusively breastfed for <4 months, or never breastfed); childcare attendance (no childcare, any form of childcare); number of children in the household (no other children, at least 1 other child). Both univariable and multivariable models were constructed. Multivariable models were adjusted for all variables listed above.

Our data show that during their fVDEs, infants do not always experience respiratory symptoms. The cumulative proportion of infants in our cohort with fVDEs from viruses other than HRV increased steadily after age 6 months. The delayed appearance of these other viruses may be from the protective effects of maternal antibodies and reduced exposure, as attendance at childcare centers is less common in this age group [3, 32].",

Whereas RSV predominates in hospitalized infants aged <6 months with LRTIs, HRV is the most common virus detected in older infants and children admitted with wheezing illnesses, which are often recurrent and associated with a subsequent increased risk of asthma [20\u201322, 41]. In contrast, community-based studies like our own find symptomatic fVDEs with HRV occurring by age 4\u20136 months, and with RSV and other viruses appearing on average beyond this age [19, 38, 42]. Viruses such as RSV, PIV, INFV, and HMPV are more likely than other viruses to be associated with respiratory symptoms [9] and, consequently, although less commonly exposed to these viruses than HRV at a young age, it is thought that young infants hospitalized with more severe disease have preexisting smaller airways, have immature immune systems, and/or are lacking protective maternal antibodies [43, 44]. As these infants become older and their airways grow and immune systems mature, the symptoms of infections by these other viruses lessen [31, 38].",

A recent report suggested that HRV detection in the first 4 weeks of life, even if asymptomatic, may help program immune memory with an exaggerated T-helper 2 (rather than T-helper 1) mucosal immune response and impaired antiviral responses [45]. This suggests a potential pathway for the later development of asthma and allergic sensitization in susceptible individuals. If true, interventions seeking to reduce HRV infections in high-risk infants will need to be introduced early. Although maternal vaccines to protect infants from early respiratory virus infections is an active area of research, especially for RSV and influenza viruses [32], our study emphasizes the predominance of early HRV detections, the long-term effects of which remain uncertain in healthy infants. It also highlights that for many in our study population, their first infection from non-HRV viruses occurs at an age when maternal vaccines may no longer be protective [32].",

These findings indicate that, while common, these viruses often cause mild or no ARI symptoms, even after an fVDE [9, 46, 47].

The return rate of 68% of expected swab is noteworthy given the project\u2019s intensive and prolonged nature. Potential limitations include parents missing very mild symptoms. However, we minimized reporting inaccuracy by training parents on symptom recognition and diary completion before they commenced the study and included only doctor-diagnosed episodes of otitis media and pneumonia [3]. This study design has been used successfully before where parents were trained to recognize respiratory symptoms [48]. Another limitation is parents having a suboptimal nasal swabbing technique [28]. However, sensitive molecular detection methods combined with mailed parent-collected nasal swabs provide comparable results with nasopharyngeal swabs collected by health professionals [27, 48, 49]. For logistical reasons, we did not include other respiratory viruses, such as INFV-C or PIV-4, in our assays, although 17 viruses still provide a comprehensive survey of early-life exposures. Additionally, 29% of HRV-positive specimens were unable to be typed, mainly due to low viral loads, a finding comparable with other community-based cohort studies [50]. We may have underestimated virus shedding duration because of missing swabs or swabs being collected only weekly. Similarly, ascribing symptoms to viruses when swab collection was not always done weekly or if other viruses were detected during the fVDE could compromise accuracy, although subanalyses of sole fVDEs were reassuring. It is also likely that we were unable to identify risk factors associated with symptomatic non-HRV fVDEs because of a lack of power, as numbers for some subcategories were small. As is common with cohort studies, our families were from more advantaged backgrounds, but our findings for infections rates, such as RSV, approximate recent studies [23, 37, 38] and provide an insight into respiratory viruses affecting infants from a developed country in a subtropical, urban setting.",

The onset of fVDEs for other respiratory viruses increased after age 6 months, with RSV and HMPV having the more severe symptoms, but identifiable sociodemographic and seasonal factors were not consistently associated with symptomatic fVDEs in our cohort. Whether early fVDEs, particularly from HRV, are important or preventable and have adverse long-term effects on some individuals warrants further study.",
