Canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) are known pathogens of domestic and wild carnivores worldwide [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. Although CPV infection is a relatively new disease first reported in the late 1970s in domestic dogs [5], the virus has spread rapidly [7,9]. In Europe, the presence of CPV has been documented in a variety of free-ranging carnivore populations from canids to mustelids and viverrids, through serology or molecular methods [7,[10], [11], [12]]. Additionally, Duarte et al. 2013 [10] reported high exposure to parvoviruses in mesocarnivores from Portugal, but to date, no cases of mortality among wild carnivores have been reported in Iberian Peninsula [13,14].",

In fact, small fragmented populations, such as those of Iberian wolves, are thought to become more vulnerable to disease outbreaks [2,29].

The available diagnose tools used (serology or molecular) or the target material (scats or body tissues) impair, to some extent, the interpretation and comparison between datasets. Thus, with the present study we intend to investigate occurrence of infection and spatio-temporal patterns of selected viral pathogens (CDV, CCoV and CPV) circulating in free-ranging populations of carnivores from northern Portugal. The use of combined approaches that include serological (Abs) and molecular detection as means for an enhanced perception of the results and inter study comparisons is discussed. The resulting information has critical implications for understanding of disease dynamics in these species and broader conservation policies.",

This seems to be particularly significant in the two species of canids, where wolves presented an infection rate close to 100 %, although with a high variability of viral loads (ranging from 41.9\u201312.5 Cts). CPV was detected in all sampled years and across all seasons in C. lupus, suggesting its enzootic nature in this study area. We believe that the social habits of Iberian wolves [36] may increase the frequency of intra-specific contacts and thus promoting the pathogen transmission. The findings mimic the results obtained by Duarte et al. [10], where some southern populations of mesocarnivores in Portugal also reached 100 % prevalence, using the same methodological approach. In foxes, for example, CPV DNA was detected in almost 79 % of the tissue samples, not far from 83.3 % obtained in our study and within the confidence interval. Contrastingly, other European studies described a much lower prevalence, ranging from 3.5\u201315.2% in wolf scats in Italy [11,12], or 12.1 % obtained in France [11,20], and even a total lack of viral DNA detection in tissue samples from several species (Germany [6].",

The high resistance of CPV to adverse environments [39], the higher sensitivity and specificity of qPCR, and the availability of target tissues for viral replication in vivo [10], may explain the higher detection of CPV DNA, with variability of the viral load. Nevertheless, there was a lower seroprevalence of CPV, as positive samples were approximately 30 % lower compared to results obtained through molecular assays. This discrepancy may be explained by several factors including: the use of lung, liver or spleen tissue extracts as the biological matrix for Ab detection; the use of the anti-dog conjugate in the ELISA assay for canids samples, and the lower sensitivity of ELISA assays for Abs detection versus qPCR for nucleic acid detection [37,40]. Additionally, we found a link between sample preservation status and seropositivity. Yet, the seropositivity rate obtained suggests a high rate of CPV exposure, but a low rate of CPV induced mortality [4], suggested by the perdominant low viral load detected in the samples.",

In comparison, the incidence was much lower in Italian and French wolf populations using faecal samples [11], which is not surprising given the low stability of viral particles in scats [45]. CCoV RNA has been detected in dog tissues across Europe [46], but despite previous efforts, only a single positive mongoose has been recorded in Portugal [10]. Thus, our results represent the first record of viral infections in wild populations of C. lupus and V. vulpes in Iberia, as well as for L. lutra and G. genetta.",

Almost half of the known infectious diseases of free-ranging carnivores are of viral origin [3]. Although the three viruses here studied have been associated with mortality in wild and domestic canids worldwide, and some viruses could, theoretically, threaten the viability of small isolated populations (e.g. CPV [29]), their impact in wild carnivore populations is still largely unknown, particularly among the northern Portuguese populations. Despite high prevalence levels of CPV and CDV our populations, none of these pathogens seem to have been associated with declines in Iberia, or listed among the major threats to the wild carnivores [56]. This can be explained by a greater impact of fragmentation (road-kills) and illegal hunting, and/ or simple lack of robust data and regular disease surveillance. Nevertheless, our results suggest a high and common exposure to CPV and CDV, with a higher seroprevalence of Abs when compared to similar studies conducted in the Iberian Peninsula [8,31]. Furthermore, we detected different antibody titers towards CPV and CDV, suggesting different contact timings between the animals and the viral pathogens. Immune response towards CPV and CDV infection is considered lifelong, thus detection of seropositive animals implies exposure but also protection against the virus [57].",

Unvaccinated dogs, as well as wolf prey species, or scattered infectious faeces/urine, make the transmission of viral pathogens between populations a likely scenario [58]. The control and widespread vaccination of domestic dogs and cats could reduce the potential spill-over of pathogens. Additionally, constant evolution of virus through mutations in the genome [59,60] present a challenge for pathogen detection and consequently for adequate wild carnivore populations\u2019 management. This means that the results obtained in this and other studies may underestimate the infectious pressure, particularly when a single diagnostic test is used. Thus, continuous surveillance of viral pathogens and longitudinal studies in stray and wild animal populations are crucial to detect new viral variants potentially escaping both the host immune system and detection methods.",
