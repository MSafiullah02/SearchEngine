If a cut-off of 15 reads was handled, 321 sensitivity declined to 67% (Table 4) . 322 mNGS target read count showed a correlation with the Cq values of the qPCR (Figure 7) . The addition of an internal control to a PCR reaction is widely used as an quality control of a 376 qPCR [38] . While the addition of internal controls in mNGS is not yet an accepted standard 377 procedure, we employed EAV and PhHV1 as an RNA and DNA controls, respectively, as for 378 diagnostic application such precautions are required. The amount of internal control reads 379 and target virus reads have been reported to be dependent of the amount of background reads 380 (negative correlation) [39] . In our protocol, the internal controls were used as qualitative 381 controls but may be used as indicator of the amount of background. Since the NCBI database 382 was lacking a complete PhHV1 genome, the Centrifuge index building and classification was 383 limited to classification on a higher taxonomic rank. In order to achieve classification of 384 RNA viruses, that were not recovered by mNGS had high Cq values, over 31, i.e. a relatively 389 low viral load. This may be a drawback of the retrospective nature of this clinical evaluation 390 as RNA viruses may be degraded due to storage and freeze-thaw steps, resulting in lower 391 sensitivity of mNGS. A correlation was found between read counts and PCR Cq value, 392 demonstrating the quantitative nature of viral detection by mNGS. Discrepancies between the 393 Cq values and the number of mNGS reads may be explained by 1) unrepresentative Cq 394 values, e.g. by primer mismatch for highly divergent viruses like rhino/enteroviruses and 2) 395 differences in sensitivity of mNGS for several groups of viruses, as has been reported by 396 others [42] . Additionally, several viral pathogens were detected that were not targeted by the 397 routine PCR assays, including influenza C virus, which is typical of the unbiased nature of 398 the method.

Such application would require the careful definition and 363 validation of several parameters to enable the accurate assessment of a clinical sample with 364 regard to the presence or absence of a pathogen, in order to fulfil current accreditation 365 guidelines. For this purpose, this study has initiated the optimization of several steps 366 throughout the pre-and post-sequencing workflow, which are considered essential for 367 sensitive and specific mNGS based virus detection. Many virus discovery or virus diagnostic 368 protocols have focussed on the enrichment of viral particles [37] with the intention to 369 increase the relative amount of virus reads. However, these methods are laborious and 370 intrinsically exclude viral nucleic acid located in host cells. The current protocol enabled high 371 throughput sample pre-treatment by means of automated NA extraction and without depletion 372 of bacterial nor human genome, with potential for pan-pathogen detection.

The range of DNA input for library preparation was 0.5 ng/\u00b5l for 145 throat swabs (see reproducibility experiment) up to 300 ng/\u00b5l for bronchoalveolar lavages 146 To compare the effect of different DNA fragmentation techniques, ten samples were 1) 150 chemically fragmented using zinc (10 min.) and 2) physically fragmented using sonication 151 with the Bioruptor \u00ae pico (Diagenode, Seraing, Belgium, on/off time: 18/30s, 5 cycli) [20]. 152 Three samples were also tested with the 3) high intensity settings of the Bioruptor \u00ae pico 153 (on/off time: 30/40s, 14 cycli). 154 Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina \u00ae [21] using single, unique adaptors.
