Together with the livestock sector in general,4 these services have been marginalised and underfunded for decades throughout much of the developing world to the point that they do not have the capacity to meet the challenges of an increasingly commercialised livestock industry, poverty relief, sustainable food security, and food safety.4, 5, 6 For example, in 2013, hundreds of pigs that had died from unknown causes were dumped into a tributary of the Shanghai river, the source of much of Shanghai's drinking water.7 This incident was symptomatic of larger problems with animal health care in China and prompted Jia Youling, head of the Chinese Veterinary Medical Association and former head of the Ministry of Agriculture's Bureau of Veterinary Medicine, to observe that the Chinese veterinary medical system is nowhere near adequate. Jia further remarked that in China, veterinary medicine is barely recognised as a profession.7\n",

At present, yields from their animals are meagre at best, owing to poor nutrition and chronic infections. Unhealthy livestock also carry increased food safety risks and restrict access to lucrative markets. As a result of these problems, more animals are needed to meet rising demand, which is not a sustainable approach.14 A better approach would involve fewer, healthier, and more productive animals. Investment in research on infectious disease control and food safety is urgently needed in addition to studies on genetics, nutrition, management, market access, and rural economic growth.",
