These situations include making life or death decisions for patients and their families regarding use of limited health care resources. It includes caring for patients with quickly deteriorating conditions and limited treatments available. Until recently, these situations seemed far from home, and now they are in our own hospitals. As the pandemic broadened its reach, the reality that we as surgeons may be joining the front line is real. It may be happening to you now; it may be on the horizon in the coming weeks.",

Assume every patient has tested positive, whether in the operating room (OR), emergency department (ED), intensive care unit (ICU), or the elevator. We are bound to our hospital rules for personal protective equipment (PPE), but to the extent you are capable, be aggressive with your protection. SAGES has endorsed statements by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and Joint Commission concerning your ability to protect yourself. Make sure your leadership has seen these statements. When you are at work, be vigilant about practicing physical distancing. Be pathologically cautious over where you go, what surfaces you touch, and what precautions you take. If you do not already have an obsessive-compulsive disorder, develop one. We have to face this fight. So, whether you are already in the fight or bracing to enter it, know that fear is here or on its way. Together, we need to expect it, accept it, and, most importantly, take control over it.

Healthcare workers are most exposed to the virus and many have contracted the disease with some fatalities. The fear of spreading it to family members is a real problem. Having to self-isolate from your social support in the case of a positive test adds to the stress of an already traumatized surgeon. In the current situation, when there is not enough personal protective equipment, it will only make the stress worse. Incidents of PTSD have been reported in parents and children who were quarantined during the SARS outbreak [1] . Apart from taking measures to minimize the spread of disease to family members or loved ones like isolation, wearing masks, hand hygiene, physical (not social) distancing, there are few things we can do to help during the period of isolation. Talking to friends and family via video call is a great way to be in touch with your loved ones. As suggested by astronaut Scott Kelly in the New York Times recently, maintaining a routine and picking up hobbies like reading, playing instruments or making art can help to cope with such situations [2] .

For instance, clinicians worldwide are forced to make life or death choices about rationing care [3]. While we have no way of knowing if or when the curve will be flattened, if our hospital surge plans will be enough or if our treatments will make an impact, what we do know is that regardless of our current specialty and regardless of the time since we practiced general medicine, that our contribution in fighting this medical nightmare is a unique and noble one. Our surgical training and heritage will support us. The role we may serve during the present need eclipses and stretches our normal patterns of practice, but not beyond the depth of our training backgrounds. Our SAGES community has issued statements on the basics of mechanical ventilation and acute care surgery management recommendations among others. We can help take control of our anxiety by ensuring that there will be oversight from a more experienced physician (critical care and infectious disease) that we can turn to for medical decision-making. On the flip side, we must be prepared to be asked to perform duties that are below our skill level. It is important to be flexible, open-minded, and adapt to the needs of our redeployment. If we are redeployed as a team, take control by ensuring that the junior members (residents, physician assistants, medical assistants) are donning/doffing proper PPE and are protected from unsafe clinical situations.",

That may force surgeons to operate at facilities with which they have less familiarity and may bias their booking to lower acuity, less complicated cases. Surgeons should align with their hospital leadership as much as they can and are comfortable doing so to have open and honest dialogue about how and when to resume booking elective cases; their outpatient office visits could begin around the same time to begin seeing new patients again. While much uncertainty exists with this crisis, one potential overlooked element is exactly how to return to normal professional workloads. This uncertainty can serve as an additional stressor, but frequent conversations with OR and hospital leadership can help to ease the stress, and allow for a plan to move forward once given the ability to do so.
