Technical consultations are continuously sought with global public health agencies such as WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.1\n",

Yet the Saudi MOH has to depend on health authorities in other countries to implement public health regulations reliably. This might not be a problem for high-income countries with established health systems, but low-income and middle-income countries, where most Muslim pilgrims come from, could need assistance to implement the strict regulations. Assistance can take many forms, including provision of training to strengthen public health systems in pilgrims' host countries.",

The University, to be in Mecca, will provide education, training, and research to improve Hajj services. The University could benefit from the experience of the Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva, in global health diplomacy training, and other international and local public health institutes such as the Hajj research centre, the Saudi centre for disease control and prevention, and local universities. The proposed new University can be seen as an example of Saudi Arabian global health diplomacy, which could be beneficial in sharing experience of international health system strengthening to control potential global public health hazards, such as poliovirus in Pakistan.7\n",
