This research aims to propose a Machine-Learning-System (MLS) to detect the COVID-19 infection using the CT scan Slices (CTS). This MLS implements a sequence of methods, such as multi-thresholding, image separation using threshold filter, feature-extraction, feature-selection, feature-fusion and classification. The initial part implements the Chaotic-Bat-Algorithm and Kapur's Entropy (CBA+KE) thresholding to enhance the CTS. The threshold filter separates the image into two segments based on a chosen threshold 'Th'. The texture features of these images are extracted, refined and selected using the chosen procedures. Finally, a two-class classifier system is implemented to categorize the chosen CTS (n=500 with a pixel dimension of 512x512x1) into normal/COVID-19 group. In this work, the classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine with linear kernel (SVM) are implemented and the classification task is performed using various feature vectors. The experimental outcome of the SVM with Fused-Feature-Vector (FFV) helped to attain a detection accuracy of 89.80%.",

The infection caused by COVID-19 severely affects the respiratory system by causing the severe pneumonia. Due to its harshness and the spreading rate, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently announced it as pandemic [9] . Even though various controlling and treatment procedures are implemented from December 2019 to till date, the mortality due to COVID-19 infection is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 is a recently emerged infectious disease discovered initially in China (Wuhan) in December 2019 [9, 14] . The drug discovery for this disease is still in the research phase and no approved drug is available for COVID-19. Due to these reasons, the mortality rate is rising globally [7] .",

In this work, the axial CTS of normal/COVID-19 class are considered to test the performance of the proposed MLS. Initially, the visibility of the infected section is enhanced using a tri-level thresholding implemented using the Chaotic-Bat-Algorithm and Kapur's entropy (CBA+KE). After the thresholding, a bi-level threshold filter discussed in [26, 34] is implemented to separate the image into Region-Of-Interest (ROI) and artifact. A feature extraction procedure is then implemented to extract the image features from original, threshold and ROI. After extracting the features; the dominant features from each image category is selected using the statistical test and the chosen features are then considered to train, test and validate the classifier system implemented in this work. Further, a future fusion technique is also employed to increase the classification accuracy. ",

In this work, a threshold filter implemented in [34] is considered to separate the threshold image into ROI and artifact. As discussed by Rajinikanth et al. [26] , the threshold level (Th) of the filter is initially identified manually and this threshold is then considered for all other images. The extracted ROI has the pneumonia infection section due the COVID-19 and this section is then considered for further assessment. From the ROI, the pneumonia infection is then segmented using the watershed-segmentation discussed in [26] . The segmentation result confirms that, proposed methodology helped to extract the pneumonia infected region from the axial, coronal and sagittal view of the CTS.",

The results confirm that, proposed work offered better segmentation on the considered CTS irrespective of its orientation. After confirming the segmentation performance on the considered case-study, the proposed MLS is then considered to classify the CTS database into normal/COVID-19 class using a chosen procedure. As discussed in section 3, all the images of the considered CTS database are initially enhanced using the CBA+KE threshold and from the enhanced image the ROI is extracted by implementing the filter with a chosen thereshold of Th=179\u00b14. Later, the essential image features, from the original, threshold image and the ROI are extracted using DWT, GLCM, HuM and entropies; as discussed in section 3.3. Later, the feature selection is implemented for the DWT, which helped to reach a final feature vector of dimension 47x1 is reached and is then named as Initially, 1 FV is considered to evaluate the performance of the classifier on the considered data and the attained results are depicted in Figure 5 . The performance of the classifier is verified using a five-fold cross validation and the best value among the five trials are chosen for the assessment. Table 2 and Table 3 . The results of these tables confirm that, the classifier accuracy achieved with the fused-feature-vector is better and these results confirm that, the increase in number of features will increase the classification accuracy. The classification accuracy attained with 2 FFV is better compared to the accuracy attained with 1 FFV as well as 1 FV . Along with the accuracy, it is necessary to compute the overall accuracy of the classifier, to confirm its clinical significance. To get the information about the overall performance of the classifier, Glyph plot is considered in this work. The Glyph plot [] will provide a graphical representation based on the amplitudes of the performance measures. Usually, the Glyph plot with larger dimension represents the better overall performance and the Glyph plot achieved for various classifiers using 1 FV , 1 FFV , and 2 FFV are depicted in Figure 6 .",

This work proposes a MLS using a sequence of procedures ranging from image pre-processing to the classification to implement a scheme with better detection accuracy. The proposed MLS initially implements an image thresholding process with CBA+KE to enhance the test image and then implements a threshold filter to separate the ROI and artifact. Later, essential procedures, such as feature-extraction, feature-selection, feature-fusion, and classification are employed in the proposed MLS. In this work the classifier units, like NB, KNN, DT, RF and SVM are considered and its performance are individually tested with chosen features, such as investigation of this study confirms that, the classification accuracy of SVM is 89.80% when 2 FFV is considered to train, test and validate the classifier. This confirms that, when the proposed MLS is equipped with the SVM classifier, a better classification is attained with the considered CTS database.",
