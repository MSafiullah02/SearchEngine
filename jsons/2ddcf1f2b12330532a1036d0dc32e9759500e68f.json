            "text": "Chest CT can be used to determine the temporal disease stage of COVID-19 pneumonia and measure its severity [1] [2] [3] . In the early stage of viral replication (day 0-4) ground-glass opacities are the predominant lesion. In the progressive stage (day [5] [6] [7] [8] , crazy paving patterns mark the increased recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung interstitial space. Peak stage (day [10] [11] [12] [13] is marked by consolidation due to tissue organization with fibrosis and diffuse alveolar damage. These radiological lesions are not specific for SARS-CoV-2 and are observed also in other viral pneumonia and noninfectious inflammatory lung diseases. In a pandemic setting, however, with high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and low prevalence of other viral lung infections, these non-specific changes harbor diagnostic power to diagnose COVID-19 in symptomatic patients or to screen presymptomatic infections as part of infection control measures. The reference method for COVID-19 diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 PCR, is highly specific but its sensitivity is variable and might be as low as 70% in the early stage of infection 4 due to low viral loads and suboptimal sampling. In overwhelmed health care systems, limited PCR capacity and relatively slow turnaround times create bottle necks for efficient triage. Chest CT is increasingly used as fast and readily available alternative to diagnose or screen COVID-19 and with limited scientific scrutinization integrated in practice and guidelines 5 . As outlined by Hope M. and Raptis C. et al [6] [7] [8] , studies supporting the chest CT for COVID-19 screening showed major methodological concerns. First, most studies were underpowered with the exception of one study on 1014 symptomatic COVID-19 patients that reported a sensitivity of 97% at a low specificity of 25% 3 .",

On admission patients received combined chest CT for CO-RADS scoring (CT-CORADS) and SARS-CoV-2 PCR (Table 1) . Overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients was 41.7%. In symptomatic patients with CO-RADS 5, 89.4% were PCR+ as compared to only 8.6% PCR+ cases in symptomatic patients with CO-RADS 1. ROC analysis confirmed the significant diagnostic power (P<0.001) of CT-CORADS with AUC = 0.891 (95%CI 0.868-0.911) to predict SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positivity (Fig. 1A ). Next we calculated likelihood ratios (LR) for each CO-RADS score in symptomatic patients (Table 1) (Table 1 ). ROC analysis indicated that CT-CORADS in asymptomatic patients had diagnostic power (P<0.001) to predict SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positivity with AUC = 0.700 (95%CI 0.672-0.726) (Fig. 1A) , albeit significantly less than in symptomatic patients. The percentage of PCR-positive cases was 3.0%, 8.2%, 11.6%, 17.8% and 32.4% in CO-RADS 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Analysis of likelihood ratios (Table 1 , Fig. 1C ) indicated that only CO-RADS 1 could slightly lower the odds of a positive PCR (LR=0.56, 95%CI 0.43-0.73), that CO-RADS 2 had no diagnostic meaning with the 95% CI encompassing LR=1 and that CO-RADS 3 and higher, chest CT increased the odds of a positive PCR, resulting in a positive shift from pre-to post-test probability (Fig. 1C) .

A novelty in our approach was the attribution of likelihood ratios to each CO-RADS score, allowing rational selection of possible dichotomizations as function of the clinically desired sensitivity/specificity. In a high prevalence setting -symptomatic patients in a pandemic setting -a CO-RADS \u00b3 3 achieves acceptable sensitivity of 89.1% and specificity of 72.5% to serve as pre-triage. CO-RADS 5 was particularly powerful and strongly increased the odds of a positive PCR from 41.7% to 89.4% and could thus serve as alternative triage in emergency settings with bottlenecks in PCR testing.",

In clinical practice, however, this does not argue against its medical utility, since a CO-RADS score of 5 is always an informative finding that should trigger targeted reflex testing for respiratory pathogens and differentiation between infectious versus noninfectious inflammatory conditions. In addition to its diagnostic value, chest CT is evidently also useful to assess the overall severity of pulmonary involvement (number of affected lobes and residual amount of well-aerated functional tissue) in COVID-19, and provides a direct view on the temporal evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection as proxy for its immunological stage. This might harbor prognostic value, outside the scope of present analysis. Finally, chest CT allows the detection of other medical .
