This result was similar to that reported in a previous study which found that plasma PTX\u20103 levels could be used to diagnose the severity of community acquired pneumonia in adults.7 We also found that the PCT level reflects disease severity and prognosis in children with LRTI. Our findings support previous studies which reported similar findings.15, 16 There was a lack of correlation with other clinical signs of disease severity. This might be because the age of the study population and the disease category were different from previous studies which involved rather serious diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis in adults.13, 14, 17\n",

One possible explanation for this finding is that it might have been due to the limitations of a nasopharyngeal swab: we presume that even patients with no detectable viruses might actually have been infected.18 Our study also found that PTX\u20103 levels did not vary depending on the types of virus causing infection. This is because PTX\u20103 acts as a part of the innate immune system as a pattern recognition molecule. PTX\u20103 is also involved in resistance against some viral infections.5 PTX\u20103 binds both human and murine cytomegalovirus (HCMV and MCMV, respectively) and reduces the viral infection of dendritic cells in vitro.19 Accordingly, ptx3 \u2010/\u2010 mice present a higher susceptibility to infections than wild\u2010type mice, and the viral titer is reduced upon treatment with recombinant PTX\u20103.19 Moreover, PTX\u20103 protects MCMV\u2010infected mice from Aspergillus fumigatus superinfection and enhances the production of IL\u201012 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 by dendritic cells and T cells, respectively.19\n",
