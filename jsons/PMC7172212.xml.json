It remains the most popular method for molecular detection of disease and is used globally for pathogen detection. It is considered the gold standard for molecular detection due to its high assay specificity and sensitivity and in our lab comprises 75% of sample testing. However, qPCR methods are still largely in-house developed and maintained. Almost all of this testing method is now automated by off-the-shelf machinery and consumables. However data-analysis and associated quality control still need to be done manually. Manual interpretation is also required for most commercial qPCR assays (e.g. Focus Diagnostics, CDC kits, etc.). This final interpretation process is complex requiring expertise and rigorous oversight, so is a burden on laboratory staffing. The complex interpretation process can be off-putting to laboratories considering implementing such assays.",

A far larger saving of 40 min per run was achieved for the verification/validation steps (e.g. second check and entering control data into Westgard). This probably reflects the fact that PCR.Ai does this automatically, whereas the manual system is reliant on the second checker reviewing the whole run. During our review, further delays were observed when the second checker was unavailable to carry out checks and Westgard entry (e.g. breaks, other runs to interpret, meetings, end of shift, absence etc). Applying these savings to a whole year of respiratory service would result in a time saving of 160 h per year based on one run per day over a 5 day week. In reality, we tend to run more than one respiratory qPCR per day and offer our service 7 days a week. Similar savings of 32 min per run were achieved for the norovirus qPCR (the lower time savings likely reflect that this is a more straightforward assay to interpret due to it having less targets and associated controls). If we were to apply PCR.Ai to the remainder of our qPCR tests (>20) this would significantly increase the overall savings to the laboratory.

PCR.Ai have already begun to introduce methods that use less clinical data and a small number of dilution series to calibrate the learning machine and we will evaluate the performance of this in due course.\u2022The assays assessed here are qualitative assays. We wish to assess PCR.Ai on quantitative assays to determine how well it works on these more complex assays.\u2022PCR.Ai works with most qPCR machines. It would be useful to see how well PCR.Ai works with other platforms (e.g. Roche LightCycler or Bio-Rad CFX).\u2022Data examined here all were produced by one primer/probe lot. We plan to investigate PCR.Ai\u2019s performance with lot-to-lot reproducibility and this may need to be included in our validation of new primer/probe lots.\n",

            "text": "Although not often discussed in the literature, we find that in practice different in-house qPCR tests vary in their ease of interpretation and therefore different tests may be more burdensome for staff than others. This could be due to assays being \u201cmessy\u201d and having many ambiguous traces to interpret. Furthermore, in our laboratory, quantitative assays are often considered by staff to be more complex than qualitative assays and take longer to interpret. We have also encountered differences between the software used by different qPCR platforms, which can in turn affect the ease of result and run interpretation. Consequently, we find that some staff attempt to avoid particular assays, whereas others can become stuck on one particular assay as the resident expert. Taken together such issues can result in variable expertise between the \u201cexpert\u201d staff members.",

Tests will no longer be only under the auspices of particular staff. Furthermore, its ease of use should allow laboratories to use less skilled and experienced staff to interpret such assays. This is beneficial to laboratories already with such assays and could lead to restructuring of staff within a department. It is also beneficial to laboratories without such assays or staff expertise, as now they will be easier to implement and interpret, and lead to better access to qPCR technology (either in-house or commercial kits). If PCR.Ai was to become widely adopted, there would be better service and standardisation by and between labs - improving tests and patient care by region, nationally and internationally.",

            "text": "PCR.Ai offers numerous other benefits to the laboratory. It can link directly with laboratory LIMs, reducing manual steps still further. This should lead to a reduction in transcription errors and improved test TRT. PCR.Ai stores all the qPCR run data on hardware/in the cloud, thus providing long-term records of each qPCR run as well as all related decisions. For example, for each run it is possible to see the user who carried out the run, any decisions relating to samples or controls (and who made these decisions), as well as the outcome. Presently it would be difficult for most laboratories to keep such information. This aspect is excellent for various accreditation systems (e.g. ISO15189 as now mandated by UKAS). Furthermore, as all the PCR.Ai data is stored in a single database, it is simple to automatically produce reports that currently are done manually - for example validation reports for new assays, controls, EQA panels or other qPCR reagents. In future, it could possibly be used to highlight unusual result patterns relating to particular users (which could aid targeted training), contamination or unexpected outbreaks.",
