Several veterinarians and well-known specialists in feline medicine have suggested that the use of PTX can be effective in treating cats with FIP. 4, [6] [7] [8] According to those reports, PTX does not cure but is suggested to prolong the life of these cats. [4] [5] 8 In these reports it has been suggested that PTX is likely to decrease vasculitis, which is responsible for the majority of clinicopathological findings of FIP. 1 The mode of action of the methlyxanthine derivatives is not fully understood, and the mechanism remains unknown. [9] [10] The PTX inhibits several cytokines, such as interleukines and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). 9 There are studies in rats and humans (in vivo and in vitro) describing the inhibition of cytokines by PTX, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and PTX and other methylxanthine derivatives seem to suppress TNF-a synthesis. 15 These proinflammatory cytokines play a major role in the pathogenesis of vasculitis. 16 Therefore, it has been suggested that vasculitis may be effectively controlled with PTX because of its effect in neutralizing or suppressing these cytokines.

This finding is supported by a close correlation between decreased fibrinogen levels and clinical improvement. 19 A study into geriatric cachexia in humans additionally showed that PTX may decrease cachexia by down-regulating proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, interleukin 1 and 6, serotonin, and interferon-c.

The most probable reason is that treatment may have been initiated too late. If signs of vasculitis were apparent, the immune-mediated process in cats with FIP might have been progressed too far to be delayed by PPF. In the present study, 21 of the 23 cats already showed effusion at the day of presentation. As shown in an experimental trial, signs of FIP become apparent 1-2 weeks after inoculation of the mutated feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). 40 As the effect of PTX is described by the manufacturer information a to be seen after 2-4 weeks after treatment initiation, and it is an assumption that the same time frame would apply to PPF, most of the cats were already dead before an effect could be reached. A further reason for lack of PPF efficiency in this study could be that the treatment intervals could have been too long. An application of PPF every 12 hours was used in this trial following the anecdotal reports describing an effect of PTX in cats. 4, 6, 32, 41 The manufacturer instruction recommends administration of PTX 3 times daily in human medicine, 20 because of a relatively short plasma half-life of 0.4-0.8 hours of the drug. A pharmacokinetic study in dogs indicated that PTX be administered every 8 hours. 42 The reasons behind the reported beneficial effects of PTX described in case reports (http://www.VIN.com) are currently unknown. Treatment might have been initiated earlier in these cats. Alternatively, FIP was not confirmed by histopathology or immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) in most of these cases; so, these cats could have suffered from other diseases. Some of the cats might have had a \"non-effusive\" form of FIP, which is considered to have longer survival times than in cats with effusion. 43 Drug interactions between PPF and the other medications (especially the glucocorticoids) in this study are a possibility, but are not reported. In addition, in a recent study in cats with asthma, glucocorticoids and PPF were safely used in combination with no adverse interactions. The glucocorticoid dose can be reduced by addition of PPF to treatment. 32 Therefore, no adverse effects were expected with the combination PPF and glucocorticoids in the present study. Glucocorticoids are routinely used in cats with FIP, 1,3,44-47 as it is not the virus itself that causes major damage but the cat's own immune reaction that leads to the fatal consequences. There are no evidence based studies that glucocorticoids have a positive effect in cats with FIP. 37 The cats of the present study received an immunosuppressive dose of glucocorticoids (2 mg/kg). Together with the stress caused by hospitalization and daily paracenthesis, glucocorticoids might be a more confounding factor. [48] [49] Potentially, a lower dose of glucocorticoids, or no glucocorticoids at all, might be better for \"long-term\" treatment. The beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in the treatment of FIP must be questioned given the median survival time is 8-9 days in the present and in the previous study, 3 both in treatment and placebo groups. 3 Therefore, future treatment study protocols should include a 3rd group of cats that receive no glucocorticoids.
