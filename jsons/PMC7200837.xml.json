First, care should always be provided with the least restrictive means. Finding this balance requires careful and constant assessment of risks and the effectiveness of current strategies. For example, completely suspending family visits may help reduce the risk of SARS-Cov-2 transmission considerably, but such a policy would be detrimental to the recovery of patients, and under the current risk assessment, it is a step too far.",

In matters that are time sensitive, leaders should avoid fatiguing their staff with repeated policy changes because it will lead to complacency.
