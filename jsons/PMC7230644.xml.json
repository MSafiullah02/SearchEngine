Given the current lack of effective treatment there is a need to explore alternative methods to contain the propagation of the infection, focusing in particular on its mode of transmission. The person-to-person modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are direct transmissions, such as sneezing, coughing, transmission through inhalation of small droplets, and transmission by contact such as contact with nasal, oral, and ocular mucous membranes [2]. SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted directly or indirectly by the saliva, and the fetal\u2013oral routes can be a possible route of person-to-person transmission as well [3,4]. Moreover, high viral loads have been found in the oropharynx of infected patients, as well as in the asymptomatic subjects [5]. This could suggest that the potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is wider than originally thought. The oral cavity is therefore directly associated with the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2 in its inhalation of ambient particles in the air and in expectorations.",

            "text": "Considered to be a major portal of entry for infectious agents [6], the oral cavity is colonized by a large number and variety of micro-organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses termed microbiota [7]. These microbial communities and their inevitable multiple synergistic and antagonistic interactions are reflected in an individual\u2019s oral and general health. The oral cavity and nasopharyngeal regions can be considered as the anatomical transition between external and internal environments. The standard oral cavity temperature is on average 37 \u00b0C with no notable variations, which gives the microorganisms a secure environment to survive [8]. Saliva is also pH stable at 6.5\u20137, which is the favorable pH to oral microbiota (bacteria species and virus such as coronavirus) [9,10,11]. Variations in saliva composition are often associated with microbiota dysbiosis and oral diseases [12]. Moreover, salivary composition influences oropharyngeal colonization characteristics and bacterial profile [13]. Oral microbiota comprises of commensal bacterial populations that sustain mutual benefits with the host and keep potentially pathogenic bacteria in balance through a number of negative feedback mechanisms. In the oral biofilm, these bacteria combine to make a barrier which resists to antibiotics, disinfectants, mechanical removal, and other stresses [14]. In addition, bacteria within biofilms have 1000 times more resistance to antibacterial treatments compared to planktonic microorganisms [15]. In the absence of proper oral hygiene, the percentage of potentially health damaging bacteria in biofilm are seen to increase, contributing to the development of chronic infection [16]. Moreover, in biofilms, bacteria can escape the immune system producing so-called superantigens [17]. In addition to host\u2013microbe interactions, the interfaces of periodontal pathogens with other non-host pathogens, such as herpesviruses like Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, can contribute to the pathogenesis of the periodontal disease [18], or can affect the outcome of viral infection and dissemination [19]. These risks are often significantly underestimated. In the future, oral care measures that are effective in reducing infection should be given higher priority.",

Conceived for short-term usage, CHX 2% is a cationic bisbiguanide widely used in general medical practice as a broad-spectrum antiseptic. CHX increases the permeability of the bacterial cell wall, resulting in bacterial lysis [23]. Its activity includes gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (gram-positive bacteria being more susceptible), aerobes, facultative anaerobes, fungi, and selected viruses [24]. While chlorhexidine significantly reduces the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, no differences were found in terms of mortality, mechanical ventilation, or length of stay in the intensive care unit [25]. However, and of major importance for the care of ventilator-associated COVID-19 patients, several drawbacks have been cited i.e., a reduced susceptibility to CHX of number of ventilator-associated pneumonia pathogens and an increased risk of death in the less severe patients [23].

Bioflavonoids are phenolic hydroxylated structures that have been synthesized from plants and have been shown to be active against fungi, bacteria, and viruses [30,31]. Flavonoids are a group of phytochemicals with a wide range of biological activities, mainly due to their antioxidant properties and their ability to regulate several cell receptors or enzymes [29]. Flavonoids have also been identified as having antiviral activity, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect, anti-allergic and antiangiogenic effects, and cytostatic, analgesic, apoptotic, hepatoprotective, antiestrogenic, and estrogenic properties [30,32,33,34]. Shimizu et al., discovered that flavonoids of Pterogyne nitens were able to inhibit the entry of the hepatitis C virus [35]. Jo et al., also suggested that the anticoronaviral activity of certain flavonoids (Rhoifolin, herbacetin, and pectolinarin) was attributable to the inhibitory effect of the 3C protease type [36]. Some others flavonoids (Isobavachalcone, herbacetin, helichrysetin, quercetin, and 3-\u03b2-d-glucoside) were able to inhibit the enzyme activity of MERS-CoV/3CLpro [36]. Ryu et al., in addition, reported that the biflavonoids of Torreya nucifera were also inhibitors of MERS-CoV/3CLpro [37].",

Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin was used as a vaccine adjuvant providing protection against the H1N1 influenza virus in the cynomolgus monkey model [52,53].
