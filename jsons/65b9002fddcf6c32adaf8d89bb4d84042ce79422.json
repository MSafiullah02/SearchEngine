All patients had been associated with the Wuhan Wholefood market, where seafood and live animals are sold. The virus spread rapidly and public health authorities in China initiated a containment effort. However, by that time, travelers had carried the virus to many countries, sparking memories of the previous coronavirus epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and causing widespread media attention and panic. Based on clinical criteria and available serological and molecular information, the new disease was called coronavirus disease of 2019 , and the novel coronavirus was called SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emphasizing its close relationship to the 2002 SARS virus (SARS-CoV). The scientific community raced to uncover the origin of the virus, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, develop treatment options, define the risk factors, and work on vaccine development. Here we present a summary of current knowledge regarding the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes.",

Alpha-and betacoronaviruses infect only mammals, usually causing respiratory symptoms in humans and gastroenteritis in other animals [2, 3] . Until December of 2019, only six different coronaviruses were known to infect humans. Four of these (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) usually caused mild common cold-type symptoms in immunocompetent people and the other two have caused pandemics in the past two decades. In 2002-2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a SARS epidemic that resulted in a 10% mortality. Similarly, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused a devastating pandemic in 2012 with a 37% mortality rate.",

            "text": "In late 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China were identified as with a novel betacoronavirus, first called the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) and often referred to as the Wuhan coronavirus. When the genomics of the 2019-nCov was sequenced, it shared 79.5% of the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV that caused the 2002-2003 pandemic [4] and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed the 2019-nCov as SARS-CoV-2 [5] . Patients began to present in November and December with various degrees of respiratory distress of unknown etiology and treated at the time as possible influenza infections. As it became apparent that most cases had a shared history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (the so-called \"wet market\"), the Wuhan local health authority issued an epidemiologic alert on 30 December 2019 and the wet market was closed. About a week later, on 9 January 2020, Chinese researchers shared the full genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2 [6] . Since the novel coronavirus was recognized, the disease it caused was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID- 19) , and several reports on the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and treatment strategies have been published [7] [8] [9] [10] . In addition, several websites have been setup to track the epidemic and the case detection rate, which are being updated as often as hourly [11] [12] [13] [14] . On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global public health emergency, sixth after H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016) and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019), and on 11 March 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic [15] . The timeline of events is summarized in Figure 1 . ",

This RBD binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor found in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract [18] thus facilitating viral entry into target cells. Based on genomic sequencing, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a mutated version of its most closely related virus, RaTG13, sampled from bats (Rhinolophus affinis) [19] . It is, therefore, believed that the SARS-CoV-2 also originated from bats and, after mutating, was able to infect other animals. The mutation increased the RBD affinity to ACE-2 in humans, but also other animals such as ferrets and Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica; a long-snouted, ant-eating mammal sold illegally for use in traditional Chinese medicine), but also decreased the RBD affinity to ACE-2 found in rodents and civets.

Binding of the SARS-CoV to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors in the type II pneumocytes in the lungs triggers a cascade of inflammation in the lower respiratory tract [20] . It has been demonstrated that when the SARS spike protein binds to the ACE-2 receptor ( Figure 3A ), the complex is proteolytically processed by type 2 transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 leading to cleavage of ACE-2 and activation of the spike protein ( Figure 3B ) [21, 22] , similar to the mechanism employed by influenza and human metapneumovirus, thus facilitating viral entry into the target cell ( Figure 3C ). It has been suggested that cells in which ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 are simultaneously present are most susceptible to entry by SARS-CoV [23] . Early indications are that SARS-CoV-2 virus also requires ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 to enter cells [24] . in the first published review of the clinical presentation of 41 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 [9] , 98% of patients had a fever, 76% had a cough, and 55% had shortness of breath on admission. However, those admitted may have had less severe symptoms for 2 to 14 days prior to presentation, during which they were likely contagious. By the time patients developed shortness of breath, they had been sick for an average of eight days. Once admitted to the hospital, all patients developed clinical pneumonia supported by chest CT findings, and 13 of the 41 patients (32%) developed hypoxic respiratory failure necessitating ICU admission. Four patients (10%) required mechanical ventilation, two of which received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to refractory hypoxia. In total, six patients died, giving a case fatality rate (CFR) of 15% and triggering panic that quickly spread worldwide. While early media reports suggested that deaths were more likely in patients with comorbid conditions, of the 41 patients described in the Chinese review, only 38% had comorbid conditions and the average age was 49.",

While initially confined to China among those who visited the Wuhan wet market, over the course of about 3 months the SARS-CoV-2 has to date been confirmed in 157 countries and one cruise ship [13] . The Chinese CDC published the epidemiologic characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak as of 11 February 2020 (Table 1 ) [26] . Initial data suggests that the majority of patients (73%) were over age 40 years, and that the risk of death increases with age. No deaths were reported in patients younger than 10 years old, and only 2.6% of the total fatalities were in patients younger than 40 years of age. [26] . [11, 13] . Due to aggressive containment strategies in China, including a mass quarantine of the entire 11 million population of Wuhan, the acceleration of new cases in China has slowed whereas that outside of China has increased. As of March 2nd, the number of daily new cases outside of China was nine times higher than those within China. Many countries have instituted travel bans and/or quarantine procedures for incoming travelers. Closures of public schools and social gatherings have been instituted in many countries in an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19 and decrease the public health burden [27, 28] and the CDC has released recommendations on school closure criteria [29] .",

Droplet transmission is typically limited to short distances, generally less than 2 m. However, the airborne route involves much smaller droplets that can float and move longer distances with air currents. Under certain humidity and temperature environments, airborne droplets can remain in flight for hours. Generally, pathogens that are transmissible via the airborne route have higher R0, because infected particles can remain in the air long after the infected individual has left the premises. This airborne route occurs, for example, in measles (R0 between 12 and 18 [34] ) and chicken pox (R0s between 3.7 and 5.0 [35] ).",

The total number of those infected includes those who were infected and recovered without presentation (I r ), infected and presented to a health care facility (I p ), and infected and died (I d ). The CFR would be M/(I r + I p + I d ). Clearly, one must have an accurate estimation of each of these parameters to accurately determine the CFR of COVID-19. While the (M) is generally easier to count, and a focus of media, the denominator can take much longer to calculate. During the early phases of a deadly epidemic, the number of those who were infected and recovered (I r ) is not yet known, since only those who were infected and became seriously ill are recognized and tested. In addition, because this is a novel virus, there were no existing detection methods, so early deaths due to clinical entities such as influenza, for example, may have been mis-attributed to CoVID-19. The viral genome was published about 2 weeks after the start of the outbreak, and PCR analysis was quickly used to diagnose suspected cases [6] . Public health officials can now test suspected cases, especially close contacts of known cases, and others with mild symptoms, but the testing capabilities can become saturated, potentially limiting the ability to get an accurate estimation of I p . For example, the initial ability of the Wuhan health authority was limited to 200 tests per day, but that number has grown to 4196 tests per day [44] . The combination of these factors leads to a gross underestimation of the denominator of the CFR calculation, and thus an exaggeration of the mortality. Until we are able to accurately represent I r and I p , it is currently impossible to precisely estimate the CFR of SARS-CoV-2.",

Table 2 . Fatality rate by age, sex, and pre-existing medical conditions. The death rate represents the probability (%) of the corresponding group of dying from SARS-CoV-2 [26] . With what we know about the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV virus, it seems reasonable to assume that those with higher levels of ACE-2 receptors may be at greatest risk. There was some speculation that the expression of ACE-2 receptors may be linked to race, specifically after an early report suggested that Asian males had higher ACE-2-expressing cell ratios than white and African Americans [48] . However, the sample size contained only eight different individuals (five African Americans, two whites, and one Asian) and extrapolating those findings to a whole race is impractical. Yet, in another study assessing ACE-2 receptor expression in tissues of 224 patients with lung cancer, there were no significant disparities in ACE-2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs. Caucasian), age groups (older or younger than 60 years old), or gender groups (male vs. females) [49] . ACE-2 gene expression was, however, significantly elevated in smokers suggesting that smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible populations. Since smoking in China is predominantly a male attribute (54% of men, 2.6% of women) [50] , this may help to explain the gender difference seen in the hospitals in China. Early in the COVID-19 epidemic, it appeared that children were a protected group, but this may have been because they were less likely to have frequented the Wuhan wet market, or because they were more likely to have asymptomatic or mild disease and thus less likely to have been tested. COVID-19 has affected infants as young as 1 month of age [51] , most with mild or asymptomatic disease. There have been no reported cases of adverse infant outcomes for mothers who developed COVID-19 during pregnancy.",

In previous betacoronavirus epidemics, several antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir, and darunavir/cobicistat (prezcobix) were tested, with some showing promising in vitro results [53] . Remdesivir, an adenosine analog used against RNA viruses (including SARS and MERS-CoV), was a candidate Ebola treatment with promising in vitro results but disappointing in vivo effects against Ebola [54, 55] . There is currently in vitro evidence that remdesivir may be effective in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection [56] . In fact, compassionate use of remdesivir was employed in the treatment of the first COVID-19 case in the United States, during a period of rapid clinical deterioration, and within one day there was dramatic improvement of the clinical condition [57] . Randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials are currently underway in China and USA to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir and initial results are expected by the end of April 2020 [58, 59] .",

The first strategy would be to employ either a small receptor-binding domain (RBD) or a neutralizing antibody targeting the ACE-2 receptor, thus blocking the binding of S protein and preventing virus entry into cells. Initial in vitro results have shown promising results [67, 68] and specific monoclonal antibodies are being contemplated as candidates for treatment [69, 70] . The main limitation of using RBDs or antibodies is that the treatment must be given within a specific time window, before the initiation of viral replication [20] . In addition, the side effects of ACE-2 blockade, especially since ACE-2 is also present in non-pulmonary tissue, must be understood and minimized before implementation. In addition, finally, the turnover of ACE-2 receptors would influence how often the therapeutic RBD or antibody would have to be administered.",

In addition, the recent mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may pave the way for more rapid development of a specific vaccine [76] . Of interest is the use of a relatively new vaccine technology, RNA vaccines that have the ability to elicit potent immune responses against infectious diseases and certain cancers [77, 78] . Traditional vaccines stimulate the production of antibodies via challenges with purified proteins from the pathogens, or by using whole cells (live, attenuated vaccines). While very effective, the creation of new vaccines can take years. Alternatively, RNA-based vaccines use mRNA that upon entering cells, are translated to antigenic molecules that in turn, stimulate the immune system. This process has been used effectively against some cancers [79, 80] , and clinical trials are underway for several other cancers [81] . In addition, the production of RNA-based vaccines is more rapid and less expensive than traditional vaccines, which can be a major advantage in pandemic situations. Clinical trials for an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are currently underway [82] . Study subjects will receive the mRNA vaccine in two doses, 28 days apart and the safety and immunogenicity will be assessed. ",

In the process, the spike protein is activated; (C) Cleaved ACE-2 and activated spike protein facilitate viral entry. TMPRSS2 expression increases cellular uptake of the coronavirus[20][21][22].Viral entry and cell infection trigger the host's immune response, and the inflammatory cascade is initiated by antigen-presenting cells (APC). The process starts with the APC performing two functions:(1) presenting the foreign antigen to CD 4 + -T-helper (Th1) cells, and (2) releasing interleukin-12 to further stimulate the Th1 cell. The Th1 cells stimulate CD 8 + -T-killer (Tk) cells that will target any cells containing the foreign antigen. In addition, activated Th1 cells stimulate B-cells to produce antigen-specific antibodies.",
