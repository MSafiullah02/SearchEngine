If in doubt about confirming cardiac arrest, then start chest compressions until help arrives - only begin to do this if there is no perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. If there is a perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, place a cloth over the patient's mouth and nose prior to starting chest compressionsAs always, make sure an ambulance is on its way. If the patient is suspected or known COVID-19 positive, then inform 999 when you call for helpUse a defibrillator if you have access to one. Early defibrillation significantly improves chances of a positive outcome for both the person in cardiac arrest and the healthcare professional (HCP) with regards to COVID-19 infection If you have access to personal protective equipment (PPE) (ie FFP3 face mask, gloves, eye protection) wear it throughoutAfter performing 'compression only CPR', it is important that the team thoroughly wash their hands and arms with soap and water. They should also seek advice from the NHS 111 if COVID-19 infection is suspected.",

This has caused a lot of confusion across the NHS posing the question 'which guidelines are the correct guidelines to follow?'. A recent statement on 24 April aligns PHE guidelines with those of RCUK,2 allowing Trusts to adopt AGP PPE if they consider it more appropriate. RCUK urge HCPs to relay this information to their trusts to best ensure their safety, as well as that of their colleagues and families.",
