They presented two channels in the assessment of carbon taxes on inequality. Altonet al. [23] explored carbon taxes in South Africa, finding that $30 per ton of co2 could achieve the targets set for 2025. Stram [24] proposed a new strategic plan for a carbon tax. Allan et al. [25] carried out a research on the economic and environmental impact of a carbon tax in Scotland. They found the target of 37% co2 reduction could be achieved when a tax of \u00a350 per ton of co2 was imposed. Carbon tax could secure a double dividend when the revenue is recycled through income tax. Nichols and Victor [26] investigated the relationship between CCS and shale gas production under carbon taxes in America, and discussed some measures which could help guide policy making. Fahimnia et al. [27] presented a tactical supply chain planning model, which integrated carbon emission and economic targets under a carbon tax policy scheme. The numerical experiments based on data from an actual organization in Australia, and the numerical results indicated their organizational and policy insights.",

Carbon trading [30] and low carbon city [31] had been applied with a series of pilot projects. Finland, Sweden, on behalf of Nordic country had levied carbon tax earlier; Boulder (American state of Colorado) and Quebec (Canada) had made a good attempt at carbon tax pilot. Their experiences are worthwhile. China will fully implement carbon trading in 2017 (In China, Shenzhen launched the first carbon trading platform on 18 June 2013. Since then, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong, Hubei and Chongqing had carried out trials for carbon trading. The carbon trading market rules in the above provinces and cities are being in gradually perfect process). By contrast, European carbon emissions trading system (EUETS), as the largest carbon trading market in the world, no longer enjoy the past glory after the hard hit in 2013 [32]. Which will have a better effect in ESER system, carbon tax or carbon trading? The key is to find suitable measures to reduce carbon emissions according to the actual situation of the corresponding district (city) [33]. For some districts (cities), carbon tax is better suited for the development of ESER to a certain degree. In the practice process, carbon tax is bound to have an effect on economy, employment and social welfare [34], [35], [36]; thus we need to know how much the economic areas are influenced by carbon tax, and how to cope with these conundrums. Only through spotting problems and solving them in the carbon tax pilot projects, can we avoid the failures of Australia and European (On July 2012, carbon tax implemented officially in Australia, the levy amount of carbon tax was 24 $A/co2. Two years later, Australia abolished carbon tax on July 2014, which aimed to lighten the burden of families and small businesses. The resolution of abolishing carbon tax aroused widespread controversy and criticism. In November 2012, European Union had to declare suspension of levying aviation carbon tax on the airlines outside the EU after the widespread objection).",

We [41] introduced a novel four-dimensional ESER dynamic evolutionary system in accordance with the complicated relationship between ESER, carbon emissions, economic growth and carbon tax, with a series of productive results. This research, based on the previous study, is to establish a Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomerations ESER system with carbon tax constraints. The novel system demonstrates the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations. Meanwhile, the commercialization management, government control and carbon tax incentives are introduced as constrained variables. The carbon tax pilot in YRD urban agglomerations and consequent influence of carbon tax are discussed. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomerations carbon tax pilot system is put forward for the first time from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics. By observing the dynamical behavior of the system, we obtain the evolutionary trends of energy intensity, economic growth and carbon emissions under various constraint conditions, followed by relative policy advice for carbon tax in YRD urban agglomerations.",

At present, energy shortages, PM 2.5 and the large scope haze weather have become the new normal, environmental and resource issues have become neck bottle of development in YRD urban agglomerations. ESER is pivotal to solve the problem of environmental emission and resources depletion problem, which could ensure the sustainable development of the socio-economic and ecology). Which one is more suitable for ESER, Carbon tax or carbon trading? There have been different ideas on this problem in the academic field [42], [43]. In YRD urban agglomerations, the enterprises are mainly small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), the private economy being very active. Judging from the present condition in China, carbon trading is more effective for large enterprise, carbon tax has better incentive and restriction effects on the SMEs. From the status quo of YRD urban agglomerations\u2019 economic development, carbon tax is better suited for the development of ESER in that area.",

ESER system will be further optimized by taking the advantage of the following measures, such as applying commercialization management to the ESER system, rationally using government control and giving full play of the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations, as well as establishing proper carbon tax incentives. Carbon tax could fulfill its function in the ESER system, forming a virtuous circle. The ESER system could better develop. Based on the four-dimensional ESER system in [41] and the characteristics of YRD urban agglomerations, it is assumed that ESER, carbon emissions, economic growth and carbon tax are restrained by commercialization management, government control, the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations and carbon tax incentives respectively. The corresponding restriction conditions are assumed to be F1x,y,z,w,t,F2x,y,z,w,t,F3x,y,z,w,t and F4x,y,z,w,t. The novel ESER system with carbon tax constraints can be described by the following differential equations:(1)x\u02d9=a1xy/M-1-a2y+a3z+a4w+F1x,y,z,w,ty\u02d9=-b1x+b2y1-y/C+b3z1-z/E-b4w+F2x,y,z,w,tz\u02d9=c1xx/N-1-c2y-c3z-c4w+F3x,y,z,w,tw\u02d9=d1w(y-T)+F4x,y,z,w,twhere xt is the time-dependent variable of ESER; yt, of carbon emissions; zt, of economic growth [41]; wt, of carbon tax. ai,bi,ci,d1,M,C,E,N,T are positive constants (i\n = 1, 2, 3, 4); t\u2208I,I is a given economic period (see [41]).",

            "text": "From Fig. 7, it can be observed that levying of carbon tax has inhibitory impact on economic growth. Both the two curves are all below the zone line (red line). There is a vast difference between the blue curve and the green one in the initial stage. During this stage, because of the economic property of YRD urban agglomerations, economic growth of the green curve keeps grow, but the value drops quickly after the apex. The diagram in the rectangular area is the drawing of partial enlargement. In the elliptic region, the absolute value of slope in the second half is remarkably larger than that in the first half. The curve tends to be stable after a short-term fluctuation, with the fluctuation time being shorter than case 1. Between elliptic region and the crossover point, the inhibitory impact on economic growth in case 2 is bigger than that in case 1. After the crossover point, the green curve is stabilized, while the blue curve still declines. The stable value of the blue curve is much smaller than that of the green curve. The above analyses indicate that YRD urban agglomerations have shown greater resilience to carbon tax than the average case of China, which has a shorter time to reach the stable value of energy intensity and error value of economic growth; and there is smaller inhibitory impact on economic growth. This also reveals the reason we choose YRD urban agglomerations to carry out carbon tax pilot in some respects.Remark 2\nFig. 7 describes the comparison diagram between the 3D ESER system and the 4D ESER system with carbon tax constraints. As a matter of fact, the total economic amount of YRD urban agglomerations is different from China\u2019s economic gross as a whole. Based on this, it is more reasonable to inspect the influence ratio of economic growth. Since the economic gross of YRD urban agglomerations is smaller, when the curves in case 1 and 2 are divided by the corresponding economic gross, the evolution tendency of the curves almost unchanged. The space between the curves will become greater, but the size relations will not change. Fig. 7 is used to show the error value of economic growth.There are a lot of differences in the diagram of energy intensity error value of economic growth between Fig. 6, Fig. 7. Apart from the differences in the parameters and the initial condition, the variable F3x,y,z,w,t in YRD urban agglomerations is the main reason. Fig. 8\nshows the evolution curve of energy intensity when c5 growing (see Appendix A). The red curve (Stable value 1) corresponds to the curve when c5=0.2368. The blue curve (Stable value 2) corresponds to the curve when c5=0.2568. The green curve (Stable value 3) corresponds to the curve when c5=0.2768. It can be observed that, when c5 becomes bigger, the peak value and stable value of energy intensity become smaller. It shows that, in the current YRD urban agglomerations\u2019 ESER system with carbon tax constraints, the economic property F3x,y,z,w,t is the key to the reduction of energy intensity. The more effectively F3x,y,z,w,t plays the role in the system, the more energy intensity declines.Levying carbon tax into the system presented in Eq. (2), when the effect of F3x,y,z,w,t gets bigger, it will exert influence on zt. zt then exerts influence on xt,yt and wt; and reduce Ut finally. Fig. 9\ninterprets the reason why the bigger F3x,y,z,w,t (c5) makes smaller Ut. It shows the error value of carbon emissions and economic growth when c5 changing from 0.2368 to 0.2568. The blue curve is the error value of carbon emissions; the green curve is the error value of economic growth. As c5 grows, the blue curve is lower than the red line (zone line) after a short fluctuation, with the error value of carbon emissions being negative, i.e. it has hampered the carbon emissions\u2019 growth. The green curve is higher than the red line except for a short curve below the red line in the early stage. The bigger c5 is, the more evident the trend is, i.e. growing c5 causes further development of the economy. In the time-dependent energy intensity formula Ut, the numerator gets \u03c61 small, while the denominator \u03c62 gets big, and Ut gets small.Along with the development of carbon tax, further maturation of the ESER system, transformation of development patterns and economic structure, carbon abatement cost will reach its inflection point at a certain moment. When the carbon abatement cost declines, the impact of zt on yt gets bigger, which reflects in Eq. (2) that the coefficient b3 gets bigger. If the policy measures remain unchanged, the effect of ESER will be neutralized, even bringing a fatal shock to the ESER system. Fig. 10\nshows the evolution diagram of YRD urban agglomerations and the whole China when the systems crash. The blue curve shows the energy intensity of the 4D China\u2019s ESER system in [41] when b3=0.4296; the ESER system will be broken fall when b3\u2a7e0.4296. In the YRD urban agglomerations\u2019 ESER system, the system will be broken fall after a brief fluctuation when b3\u2a7e0.7515. To make it more clearly, let b3=0.7815, the green curve shows its energy intensity when b3=0.7815. Comparative observations of the two curves indicate that collapse point 2 is later than collapse point 1, i.e. the collapse time of the green curve is later than that of the blue curve. The value of b3 in YRD urban agglomerations\u2019 ESER system is actually bigger than b3 in the whole China\u2019s ESER system in [41] (0.7815>0.4296). The foregoing analyses show that, compared with the 4D China\u2019s ESER system, the YRD urban agglomerations\u2019 ESER system is more stable, with stronger capacity to resist concussion.The comprehensive observations of Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10 under the same carbon tax rate and constraint conditions elaborate that the YRD urban agglomerations\u2019 ESER system with carbon tax constraints has smaller effect on economic growth with lower energy intensity and stronger capacity to resist concussion. Compared with the 4D China\u2019s ESER system, the carbon tax constraints of the former is superior to that of the latter due to the YRD urban agglomerations\u2019 economic property. Levying carbon tax wt into the YRD urban agglomerations, making use of the economic property F3x,y,z,w,t properly, these measures will promote economic growth, control carbon emissions and reduce energy intensity effectively (as shown in Fig. 9). All the above analysis provides convincing evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of levying carbon tax.\n",

This is due to the inhibition effect on economic growth surpassing the effect of reducing energy intensity. Fig. 14\npresents the error value diagram of carbon emissions and economic growth when b5 changing from 0.0213 to 0.0413. The blue curve is the error value diagram of carbon emissions; the green curve is the error value diagram of economic growth. The blue curve is always under the red line (zone line) when b5 changing, which indicates that government control could reduce energy intensity effectively. The blue curve is also under the red line (except for a slight fluctuation in the enlarged diagram). The distance between them is bigger. Take the stable values of two errors as an example, it may be observed that ratio between the two stable values (the distance between the curves and the red line) is smaller than the stable value of energy intensity when b5=0.0213 (there is a more detailed explanation in the contrastive analysis of Fig. 14, Fig. 16). With the increasing of b5 (over a critical value), the inhibition effect on economic growth will surpass the control effect on energy intensity; thus energy intensity does not reduce but increase, which suggests that government control should be sensibly used in some way. In conclusion, the energy intensity of YRD urban agglomerations cannot be controlled efficiently by simple government control. Although the energy intensity could be controlled to the stable state quickly by single government control, through which the value of energy intensity in YRD urban agglomerations has not declined finally, other constraint condition engagement is also needed to better control energy intensity.",

Generally speaking, the development of economy will result in more carbon emissions and higher energy intensity in the current economic system [47], [48], [49]. By Contrast, YRD urban agglomerations with carbon tax constraints is different. In YRD urban agglomerations, private economy is active, small and medium enterprises accounting for the majority of enterprises.

However, more variables should be included in the actual YRD urban agglomerations\u2019 ESER system, such as public acceptance, low carbon awareness and so on. Further research on the dynamic behavior of the system is necessary. In addition, the lack of statistical data might have some influence on the output parameters in parameter identification. Furthermore, the data of carbon tax is mainly based on hypothesis, surrogate data could be sought out by some more scientific methods. Besides, the effect of carbon tax is characterized by the evolution trend of energy intensity, carbon emissions and economic growth. Other measurable indicators will be analyzed in the future research.",
