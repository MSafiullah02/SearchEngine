            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a transboundary disease of pigs that is endemic primarily in Asia and Europe (Song et al., 2015). In 2013, the disease emerged for the first time in the United States and quickly spread to more than 30 states (Stevenson et al., 2013). The disease mainly affects neonatal piglets often presented with watery diarrhea, vomiting, and 90\u201395% mortality in na\u00efve populations (Stevenson et al., 2013) causing immense economic losses to the swine industries (Schulz and Tonsor, 2015). The causative agent of the disease is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an alpha-coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978, Tobler et al., 1993). PEDV encodes four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) (Brian and Baric, 2005). PEDV S protein is a type I transmembrane protein. The extracellular portion of S protein contains major antigenic determinants, and is made up of three domains, N-terminal domain (NTD), S1 domain and S2 domain. The S1 and S2 domains contain potential virus neutralizing epitopes (Huang et al., 2013, Song and Park, 2012). A recombinant, spike-based (NTD-S1) vaccine induces virus-neutralizing antibody responses in pregnant sows and protected their offspring from mortality (Oh et al., 2014). However, the cellular immune responses of this protein subunit vaccine have not been determined. Recent studies showed that PEDV infection or vaccination enhanced the antigen presenting capabilities of porcine DCs in vitro and in vivo which subsequently stimulated T cell proliferation efficiently (Gao et al., 2015, Gao et al., 2016).",

Porcine Langerin is expressed in epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), in a subset of dermal CD163low DCs and in type 2 conventional DCs in lung (Maisonnasse et al., 2015, Marquet et al., 2014). Mouse LCs and Langerinpos DCs targeted with ovalbumin antigen presented both MHC-I and MHC-II products to stimulate Th1 and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, respectively (Idoyaga et al., 2008). Langerinpos CD8\u03b1neg DCs were differentiated from bone marrow DC precursors in the skin in response to transcutaneous immunization of mice with tetanus toxoid and cholera toxin, which then accumulated in mesenteric lymph nodes and efficiently induced gut secretory IgA responses (Chang et al., 2008).",

Intraperitoneal administration of PEDV-specific antibodies obtained from sera of PEDV-infected sows reduced disease severity and increased survival of piglets upon virus challenge (Poonsuk et al., 2015). Prior exposure of 11 day-old piglets with PEDV showed reduced morbidity upon re-challenge with virus three weeks later (de Arriba et al., 2002). The reduced morbidity strongly correlated with the frequencies of PEDV-specific antibody-secreting cells in intestinal tissues as well as with serum PEDV-specific antibody levels at the day of challenge (de Arriba et al., 2002). On the other hand, PEDV induces significantly higher CD4 T cell responses but not CD8 T cell responses in ileal tissues of suckling piglets as compared to the weaned piglets. (Annamalai et al., 2015) However, the role of these CD4 T cell immune responses induced by PEDV to protection in pigs remains unknown.",

Since higher affinity antibodies are desired for \u201cdendritic cell targeting\u201d (Cheong et al., 2010), the 3B3 mAb was chosen for further analysis. The 3B3 mAb was shown to specifically stain the native porcine Langerin but not an irrelevant porcine cellular receptor; both were expressed exogenously on CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 1B). The recombinant 3B3 single chain antibody, which is a human Fc fused with 3B3scFv, also specifically stained the over-expressed porcine Langerin on CHO-K1 cells comparable with that of a positive control antibody 929F3.01 (Fig. 1B). The Langerin-targeting PEDV S antigen, which is porcine Fc fused with 3B3scFv at the amino terminus and with PEDV S antigen at the carboxy terminus (3B3scFv-pFc-PEDVsAg) (Fig. 1C), was detected as an approximately 210 KDa protein in SDS-PAGE analysis of transiently-transfected 293T cell lysates (Fig. 1D). The porcine Fc fused with the PEDV NTD-S1 only (pFc-PEDVsAg) served as non-targeting antigen and identified as an approximately 180 KDa protein in the SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1C and D). In short, the recombinant 3B3 single chain antibody specifically binds porcine Langerin which can be produced as a fusion protein with PEDV S domains.",

First, we measured T cell immune responses against DC-targeted PEDV NTD-S1 in pigs. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, stimulated in vitro with the recombinant NTD-S1 antigen, and stained for intracellular IFN-\u03b3. Flow cytometry analyses showed that the CD4posCD8pos T cell subset was the only subset showing increased mean frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells in response to PEDV NTD-S1 (Fig. 2\n). As early as 7 days after the prime vaccination in pigs, the antigen-specific CD4 T cell frequencies in the transdermal DC-targeted group were significantly higher (0.969 \u00b1 0.201, p \u2264 0.025) than those in the non-targeted group (0.395 \u00b1 0.158) and in the intramuscular DC-targeted group (0.483 \u00b1 0.067) (Fig. 2B). The CD4 T cell priming sustained in a proportion of pigs (2/8) in the transdermal DC-targeted group (p = 0.027) until 28 days after prime vaccination (Fig. 2C). At day 7 after booster vaccination, IFN-\u03b3-specific CD4 T cell responses increased significantly in the transdermal DC-targeted group (0.391 \u00b1 0.107, p = 0.016) as compared to the non-targeted group (0.108 \u00b1 0.052) (Fig. 2D). Our results indicate that transdermal delivery of Langerin-targeted PEDV S antigen significantly increased cellular responses in the CD4posCD8pos T cell compartment in pigs.",

Modified live PEDV vaccines are available in Asia, but the efficacy of these vaccines is questionable as they do not completely prevent virus shedding and outbreaks of PED continue in Asia (de Arriba et al., 2002, Oh et al., 2014). Therefore, more effective vaccines are needed to eradicate PEDV altogether from neonates, growing and adult pigs particularly in breeding herds. In this study, we developed a novel spike-based PEDV subunit vaccine candidate that was directly targeted to pig Langerin-expressing dendritic cells through a single chain antibody. This vaccine candidate enhanced the cellular immune responses, particularly in the CD4pos CD8pos T cell compartment if the vaccine was injected transdermally. This is important since traditional subunit protein-based vaccines typically do not induce strong cell-mediated immune responses. However, enhanced antibody predominantly IgG responses but reduced cellular immune responses were observed if the PEDV NTD-S1 was targeted to Langerinpos DCs in systemic sites in pigs. Our study shows that the \u201cdendritic cell targeting\u201d approaches could be incorporated into PEDV subunit vaccine developments to improve the efficacy of protein-based vaccines by modulating the cellular and humoral immune responses against PEDV.",

The results of our study also indicate that the memory immune responses are indeed developed effectively in pigs due to Langerin-targeting of PEDV antigen as demonstrated by the increased frequencies of antigen-specific CD4pos CD8pos T cells which are considered as the effector memory T cells in pigs (Gerner et al., 2009). The overall magnitude of CD4 T cell responses against Langerin-targeted PEDV NTD-S1 was comparatively higher in pigs vaccinated by the transdermal route, when compared to the intramuscular route, which is possibly mediated by either pig Langerinpos dermal DCs or LCs or both (Marquet et al., 2014, Romani et al., 2012). This is consistent with reports that mouse Langerinpos dermal DCs are capable of inducing strong T cell immune responses in skin draining lymph nodes (Wang et al., 2008), while human LCs are capable of engulfing measles virus particles through Langerin molecules to present viral antigens to CD4 but not CD8 T cells (van der Vlist et al., 2011).",

Our data suggest that IgG responses were slightly stronger against intramuscular administered targeted PEDV NTD-S1 when compared to transdermal administered antigen, however both groups showed this difference only after intramuscular boosting, which is quite contrary to the observed T cell responses after priming. This difference may be explained by the fact that pig Langerinpos DCs in systemic sites are a fraction of CD11cpos DCs which are classified as conventional type 2 DCs biased toward inducing Th2 responses (Bigley et al., 2015, Maisonnasse et al., 2015). Therefore, it is warranted to examine Th2 immune responses against porcine Langerin-targeted antigens in systemic sites in future studies. In addition, when compared to the transdermal vaccination, the intramuscular vaccination route made the antigen more readily accessible in mucosal lymphoid tissues producing significant IgA responses against PEDV NTD-S1. However, the significant differences in antibody responses between the transdermal and the intramuscular vaccination were not recognizable at the serum neutralizing antibody levels at one week after booster vaccination.",

In this study, we demonstrate the immunogenicity of spike-based protein vaccines against PEDV can be manipulated toward better cellular immune responses if the vaccine antigen is targeted to Langerinpos DCs in the pig skin. However, when the PEDV NTD-S1 is targeted to Langerinpos DCs in pig systemic sites, enhanced humoral immune responses can be observed, however these responses require a booster dose. The protective efficacy of these enhanced immune responses against PEDV need to be investigated in the future specifically in the pregnant gilt/sow vaccination \u2212 piglet challenge model.",
