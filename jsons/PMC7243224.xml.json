This makes any predictions of the impact of Brexit on the UK's oral healthcare workforce speculative.\n",

These terms have to be agreed, and until they have been, opinions can be viewed as speculative. However, Brexit will almost certainly have an impact on the UK's workforce, including the oral health workforce. Two key issues are: will EU nationals who are currently working in the UK wish to remain, and will it become more difficult for EU citizens to come to the UK to work?",

The question therefore arises as to how the GDC will assess EU dentists who wish to register. In future, one possibility is that in order to be registered they will have to pass the Overseas Registration Examination (ORE). However, as the registrar of the GDC has pointed out, this would have financial consequences.4 A system of mutual recognition of dental qualifications is operated by Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the Irish Republic.4 Such a system might provide a mechanism for the GDC to recognise dental qualifications gained in other countries, including those of the EU. However, negotiations with the countries concerned and appropriate legislation would be required before this could happen. A third but perhaps unlikely scenario is that, although no longer a member of the EU, it would still accept the Recognition of Professional Qualifications directive.3",

Such task sharing is currently common in countries such as Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands, where the ratio of registered dentists to dental hygienists is around 2:1.9 In the UK, at 31 December 2019, the number of dental hygienists registered with the GDC was 7,535, just under 3,000 of whom were also registered as dental therapists.1 Thus, in the UK, the present ratio of dentists to dental hygienists is 6:1.",

After the current interim arrangements with the EU have finished, it may well be more difficult for EU dentists and DCPs to register with the GDC, so their numbers may decline. However, other factors such as the economic situation and employment opportunities in their own countries will come into play. Overall, the probability seems to be that the number of EU dentists registered with the GDC will decline and that this will have an impact on oral healthcare workforce numbers.",

In particular, they advise on who could provide care and treatment and how they should be trained. It is currently in the middle of the second phase of its three-year programme and has recently examined evidence from the UK and other countries. The evidence from treatment trends in the NHS GDS and from other countries suggests that there will be an increased need for disease prevention and relatively simple treatment. However, due to the ageing population, many of whom have underlying medical problems, there will also be a need for more complex care and for an oral healthcare workforce which can address this need. Much of the prevention and relatively simple care could be provided by DCPs in general, and dental hygienists and therapists in particular. However, given the relatively small numbers of dental hygienists and therapists at present, it would require a considerable expansion in the number of training places before significant numbers were qualified, and it would take many years for the numbers of UK dental hygienists and therapists to match those of dentists. The current system of payment within the GDS would also need revision, as it does not recognise dental therapists and hygienists as providers. Furthermore, in 2011, for those working in general dental practice in England, over 80% of dental hygienists' income came from private fees, rather than the GDS.11 It seems unlikely that this has changed since then.",
