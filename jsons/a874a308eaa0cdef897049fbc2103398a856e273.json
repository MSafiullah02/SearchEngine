It was found that the delayed decision making of the local government officials and the limited information disclosure should be mainly responsible for the ineffective risk communication. The principles for effective risk communication concerning Wuhan's outbreak management were also discussed. The whole communication process is suggested to integrate the accessibility and openness of risk information, the timing and frequency of communication, and the strategies dealing with uncertainties.

As of January 2020, many patients have been found and identified as being infected by a novel coronavirus in Wuhan. Since 12 December 2019, when the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia, including seven critically ill cases, the pneumonia outbreak has received considerable global attention. The COVID-19 cases have covered all provinces in China and have also been reported in other countries, severe areas including Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the US, and all of these cases were exported from Wuhan [16, 17] . Chinese scientists have argued that the virus source comes from a seafood market in Wuhan, but a few infected people in Wuhan say they did not visit this seafood market. Pinpointing the actual source of the virus is a main task for current research-different findings have been published [18, 19] . An early epidemiological investigation revealed that bats may be the native host of COVID-19 [20] . The available investigations indicate that the virus has the characteristic of human-to-human transmission and is even infectious during incubation. These infections may either be asymptomatic or have symptoms that include fever, cough, and shortness of breath [21, 22] .

Meanwhile, external communication enhances stakeholders' awareness of the negative impact of the risk and their recognition about their roles in risk governance and initiation of different behaviors [25, 26] . Following this distinction and referring to China's regime, we define internal communication as the communicative process among governments and the academic community, because the majority of academic institutions are affiliated to the government or funded by officials.

The occurrence of the outbreak corresponded with China's political season, when officials gather for annual meetings of the People's Congresses-the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-run legislatures for discussing policies and praising government. Bad news is inappropriate at this time. As the governor of Hubei, Wang Xiaodong, pointed out, \"political issues are at any time the most fundamental major issues\" [27] . At the same time, the harmonious and happy atmosphere brought about by the Chinese Lunar Year Festival in society foreboded the start of the most massive annual population migration, which is called the \"Tide of Going Home\". If the outbreak information were to spread, it would influence migration and intensify social fear. Based on balancing various considerations, the government's decision making had to depend upon maintaining political image and social stability, because the outbreak management might disturb the social order. In an interview, Zeng Guang, the chief scientist of epidemic of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, indirectly admitted that the main problem came from the local government's decision making. Zeng said that the government is prone to balance many factors in decision making, such as politics, stability, and economy, and expert opinion is often partly considered by the government [15] .

Incipient risk external communication used a series of certain expressions, which conveyed the wrong perception of COVID-19 to the public. The actions of the authorities in attacking whistleblowers who privately delivered the clinical characteristics of the coronavirus on social media further enhanced people's risk perception about the outbreak. The public tended to believe that the disease had no characteristic of human-to-human transmission. As the epidemiological investigation went deeper, new conclusions made the authorities change their statement, using expressions such as \"no evidence shows the disease has the characteristic of human-to-human transmission\". However, the public could not realize the characteristic of human-to-human transmission from such an expression, and thus had no perception for self-prevention. On 20 January, Dr. Zhong Nanshan confirmed the epidemiological characteristic of human-to-human transmission, which was a sudden turn in the content of risk communication. Therefore, the risk communication was not evidence-based but arbitrary, because it failed to conform to a dynamic process as the understanding of the risk evolved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 391, "end": 394, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 395, "end": 398, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Account for the Uncertainty Inherent in Risk"}, {"text": "People have widely varying capacities to process risk messages, including scientific and technical understandings of risk.

In the risk communication of COVID-19, some cases have shown that experts or the government failed to utilize understandable explanations about the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, the scientific principles in the prevention measures, and the curative effect of therapeutic activity. The public remained ignorant or fearful. Many people used extreme methods for self-protection. Under the media's misleading influence, lots of people snapped up medicines that have not been proven to have a curative effect or hoarded masks and respirators. A research conclusion cited by Xinhua News Agency indicates that a preliminary study shows that Chinese patent medicine Shuanghuanglian can inhibit the novel coronavirus. The consequence was that lots of people queued up purchasing Shuanghuanglian at midnight. An expert clarified that this study is not a detailed research but only preliminary, and indicated that scientific expression should not be exaggerated [37] .

Identifying the points of convergence serves as a means for making sense of these interacting arguments, which leads to forming a consensus on the uncertain issue [8] (p. 17). Wuhan's case reflects the prerequisite of a message-centered approach, which means that the institution can be a barrier to information disclosure. The government's monopoly of information harms the public's right to know, and the fact that politics is the most important issue restricts the voice of the academic community. Reluctant information disclosure hampered the public's self-protection and exasperated negative impacts of the outbreak. As a consequence, the tardy strategy of lockdown broadened the outbreak scope subjectively due to people's migration. Meanwhile, in accordance with the characteristic of COVID-19, namely, that it can transmit in incubation, the public's ignorance of self-protection meant that the disease was able to infect others during gatherings and contact between people in an unperceivable way. Risk communication strategies require information sharing and establishing networks of working relationships among individuals, groups, and agencies. Establishing these relationships necessitates the accessibility and openness of information, which is the premise of collective action.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 457, "end": 460, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Accessibility and Openness of Risk Information"}, {"text": "Risk communication should begin as soon as a risk has been identified and should continue as new information becomes available [38] (pp. 72-73). For an unknown disease, communication should avoid using certain conclusions or expressions when clinical and epidemiological investigations are ongoing. Once an updated investigation is available, the information ought to be disclosed immediately. Any delay will likely lead to unexpected consequences. The government of Wuhan's first step to respond to the unknown disease was not to initiate a comprehensive investigation, but to silence and punish \"rumormongers\". The reality proves that \"rumormongers\" are innocent and that the \"rumor\" indeed functioned as an early warning. On 7 February, Dr. Li died from COVID-19, and his death unleashed an upsurge of emotion, with the public strongly criticizing the government's management of their response to the initial outbreak [39] . The shocking nature of risk can sometimes paralyze an organization, and even a holistic governance network. Therefore, inadequate preparedness, such as the shortage of goods, loose management in communities, and disordered collaboration amongst agencies, put the Wuhan and Hubei governments into a passive situation and undermined their be abstracted, namely, the government, experts, and the public. The risk communication network reflecting Wuhan's outbreak management consists of these three actors. In order to simplify their complex communications, we employed a model to demonstrate the communicative interaction that will enable a better understanding of the communication strategy and principles. The model is presented in Figure 2 below. In this model, the three components of communicative interaction are government-public, government-expert, and expert-public.

The existing literature indicates that a challenge identified in implementing openness in risk communication is that it is difficult to decide what to present and what not to present. For instance, complete transparency causes possibly unjustified fear among members of the public [46] .
