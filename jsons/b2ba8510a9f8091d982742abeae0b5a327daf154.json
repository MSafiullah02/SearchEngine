With a focus on the neurological intensive care unit (NeuroICU), this narrative review summarizes methods of measuring sleep and addresses common causes of sleep disturbance in the hospital including environmental, pharmacological, and patient-related factors. The effects of sleep deprivation on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, endocrine, and neuropsychological systems are discussed, with a focus on short-term deprivation in critically ill populations. Where evidence is lacking in the literature, long-term sleep deprivation studies and the effects of sleep deprivation in healthy individuals are also referenced. Lastly, strategies for the promotion of sleep in the NeuroICU are presented.",

Sleep is particularly important among patients recovering from critical illness.

After reviewing methods for measuring sleep, this review highlights common causes of sleep deprivation in the ICU and its impact on the functioning of major organ systems. While there is a focus on topics pertinent to the neurological ICU (Neu-roICU), we note that much of the literature comes from general critical care rather than a neurocritical patient population.",

A recent study by Foreman et al. to evaluate sleep in the NeuroICU found that 65% of patient EEG recordings could not be scored, typically due to the lack of a distinguishable posterior dominant rhythm [13] . Using scorable recordings, the authors found that patients spent significantly more time in lighter (N1) than deeper sleep stages as compared to normal values. Moreover, sleep was abnormally distributed across the day-night cycle-similar to findings in critically ill patients without neurological injury. Studies of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [14] and traumatic brain injury (TBI) [15] have also noted grossly abnormal or even absent sleep architecture in the majority of subjects; greater degrees of abnormality correlated with poorer prognosis.",

Actigraphy (which estimates sleep using a motion sensor worn on the wrist or ankle) is a convenient, noninvasive technique that can be used for extended periods of time; however, it likely overestimates sleep in a largely bedridden, sedated population [17] . It may be useful for assessing sleep fragmentation [18, 19] . Originally employed to monitor anesthesia in the operating room, BSI uses a single foam EEG sensor applied to the forehead. The BSI is calculated as a weighted sum of several EEG parameters and is scaled from 0 to 100, with larger values corresponding to a higher likelihood of alertness. BSI monitoring may predict depth of sedation in critically ill patients with brain injury [20] , but further research is necessary to demonstrate its correlation with depth of sleep in this population [21] .",

            "text": "In a recent cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study assessing sleep quantity and quality among 2005 hospitalized (ICU and other) patients in the Netherlands, 85% reported at least one nocturnal awakening, and 20% experienced sleep disturbance due to awakenings by hospital staff [22] . Our search yielded only two studies that quantify the number of care events occurring during patient sleep in the ICU. Using PSG and time-synchronized environmental monitoring, Gabor and colleagues found activities occurring approximately eight times per hour of sleep, accounting for just 7% of total arousals and awakenings (68% of sleep disruption events did not have an identifiable cause; 21% were due to sound) [8]. Tamburri et al. found an average of 42.6 interactions per night (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.), but did not directly measure sleep via PSG [23] . Nevertheless, patient care activities consistently rank as a major source of sleep disturbance in surveys of ICU survivors, even more so than noise level [5] . Although many patient care activities are unavoidable or temporally fixed, efforts have been proposed to minimize and reschedule as possible to reduce sleep disruption (see \"Strategies for Sleep Promotion in the NeuroICU\"). Specific to the NeuroICU, hourly neurological assessments (neurochecks) are performed on many patients and are often cited to justify increased nursing needs [24] . In conjunction with neuroimaging surveillance requiring travel off-unit, neurochecks have been demonstrated to impact surgical decision making in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) [25] and severe TBI [26] . The appropriate duration and frequency of these neurochecks for most diagnoses is often at attending provider discretion [26] . Evidence from patients admitted for ICH suggests that the initial 12 h is a period of frequent and prognostically important neurological change [27] , while TBI patients appear to be at highest risk of expansion of a traumatic intracerebral hematoma within 24 h from onset [28] .",

In general, sedation shares characteristics with sleep (similar receptor and network effects, muscle hypotonia, altered mentation, respiratory depression) but does not produce the full spectrum of restorative benefits found in sleep [36, 37] . Benzodiazepines, while frequently prescribed for insomnia, have actually been found to suppress REM and deeper N3 sleep stages in favor of lighter N2 sleep in healthy individuals [38] . Similarly, opioids have a sedating effect, but decrease total sleep time and time spent in deeper sleep stages [39, 40] . Other sleep-disrupting medications commonly administered to ICU patients include vasopressors [41] and beta-blockers [42] via their impacts on melatonin production; antidepressants [43, 44] , which can decrease time spent in REM sleep; continuous intravenous drips and diuretics, which may increase the frequency of toilet visits or require uncomfortable indwelling urinary catheters [16] ; and corticosteroids, which reduce REM sleep and increase the incidence of nightmares [45] .",

            "text": "One area that has been thoroughly investigated is that of mechanical ventilation, and the mode most conducive to sleep. Mechanical ventilation can disrupt sleep due to mismatch between patient demand and ventilator supply (inadequate support leading to dyspnea or excessive support leading to apnea). Studies by Parthasarathy et al. [58] and Toublanc et al. [59] found that when compared to assist control ventilation (ACV), pressure support ventilation (PSV) led to episodic hyperventilation with resulting decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide, causing apneic events. However, work by Cabello and colleagues showed no differences in sleep architecture between non-sedated ICU patients on clinically adjusted PSV, automatically adjusted PSV, or ACV. The authors therefore suggested that it is not PSV itself that causes sleep disruption but the specific ventilator settings: They used lower levels of pressure support, standard minute ventilation, and tidal volume across all modes as compared to previous authors in an effort to better mimic physiological conditions [60] . Other studies looking at proportional assist ventilation [61] -in which pressure is applied in proportion to the patient's own inspiratory effort-and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist-in which pressure is applied in proportion to the electrical activity of the patient's diaphragm-also find improved sleep quality [62] . Thus, evidence from multiple studies indicates that patient-ventilator mismatch, rather than any given ventilator mode, is most responsible for sleep disruption. However, it can be challenging to find the appropriate settings most reflective of patient physiology, and clinical conditions (e.g., intracranial pressure crises in the setting of hypercarbia) may demand certain ventilator modes. Additionally, when generalizing the results of critical care ventilation studies to neurological patients one must consider the underlying need for ventilation (e.g., airway protection versus hypoxemic respiratory failure). Moreover, NeuroICU patients may already experience frequent spontaneous hyperventilation and periodic breathing apneas from their primary injuries, making it difficult to apply optimal ventilator settings based on studies in nonneurological populations.",

Of particular interest in the NeuroICU is the impact of ventilation mode on sleep in patients with neuromuscular disease. Much of the respiratory research in this population is done using noninvasive ventilation [64] . Similar to findings with invasive ventilation, Fanfulla and colleagues found that noninvasive pressure support set with physiological parameters (tailored to the patient's respiratory effort via measurement of esophageal pressure) among neuromuscular patients with chronic respiratory failure improves nighttime gas exchange, sleep architecture, and sleep efficiency [65] .",

Notably, experimental studies of short-term sleep deprivation differ significantly in the length of sleep deprivation assessed, subject environment and behaviors, and measurement time points, which makes comparison across studies challenging. For the purposes of our discussion, short-term or acute sleep deprivation refers to sleep deprivation of less than one-week duration, while long-term or chronic deprivation is on the order of months.

Many studies have found increases in blood pressure and heart rate after a single night of experimental deprivation [67] [68] [69] vital sign measurement [70, 71] . Hospitalization itself is also associated with higher morning blood pressure in older adults [72] . The hypertensive effect of sleep deprivation has been attributed to an increase in sympathetic activity [73] , a reduction in maximum endotheliumdependent vasodilation [52] , and an upward resetting of the baroreflex set point [50, 57] . This relationship between sleep deprivation and blood pressure has particular relevance for NeuroICU patients with strict blood pressure parameters, e.g., patients with hypertensive and aneurysmal bleeds. In addition to its hypertensive effect, sleep deprivation is also correlated with increased blood pressure variability [74] , which may worsen stroke outcomes [75, 76] .",

This relationship holds true in OSA, in which higher numbers of apneic events correlate with increased blood pressure variability during wakefulness, a phenomenon which may precede the development of persistent hypertension [80] . OSA patients also have increased sympathetic activity and resting heart rate. An elevation in blood pressure and inflammation-which also increases with chronic lack of sleep [81] -may underlie this relationship, increasing cumulative cardiovascular risk. For example, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker shown to be an independent predictor of future myocardial infarction and stroke in apparently healthy individuals [82, 83] , are higher after experimental sleep deprivation [84] . Newly diagnosed OSA patients have also been found to have elevated levels of CRP, with severity proportional to the CRP level [85] .",

Short-term sleep deprivation has also been shown to lessen inspiratory muscle endurance. In humans, Chen et al. found a significant reduction in maximal voluntary ventilation after 30 h of sleeplessness, with no change in respiratory muscle strength, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced vital capacity [94] . Studies in rats [95] and exploratory work in humans [96] have suggested that the underlying mechanism is impairment of respiratory motor plasticity (i.e., inspiratory drive in response to hypoxia) with sleep deprivation, a finding that may be especially problematic among patients hospitalized for brain injury.",

However, aside from response to vaccination-consistently shown to be lower in sleep-deprived individuals [105] [106] [107] -loss of sleep has not consistently demonstrated impacts on other aspects of the immune system. Short-term sleep deprivation studies largely assess the effect of varying degrees of sleep deprivation and recovery on specific cell types and cytokines. Long-term sleep deprivation has also been associated with persistent, low-level inflammation that can increase risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease [108] and arthritis [109] and has been associated with increased risk of pneumonia [110] -at least in observational studies. The significance of these individual changes in the larger context of illness recovery or infection response is difficult to evaluate.",

Several authors report a decline in NK cell function with sleep deprivation, and a return to baseline after one night of recovery sleep [112] [113] [114] . One study did not find NK cell function recovery after resumed sleep [115] , and one found an increase in NK cell activity after severe sleep deprivation (64 h) [116] . This variation might be explained by the difference in timing of blood draws across experiments, which may be confounded by the natural circadian rhythm of NK cell activity, and the small number of subjects in each of these studies (10 or fewer).",

While cognitive function has been found to improve in the first year after discharge, long-term studies assessing outcomes several years post-ICU stay have found persistent impairment after 6 years [155] . The extent of this cognitive impairment is notable: Jackson et al. found impairments in visual domains, psychomotor speed, and verbal fluency in ICU survivors at 6-month follow-up that were clinically equivalent to mild dementia [156] . The mechanisms by which this impairment occurs in the ICU include hypotension, hypoxemia, hyperglycemia, and delirium during admission [73] .

In the acute setting, poor sleep has also been associated with a significantly greater pain experience among hospitalized burn patients [191] . Experimental work in healthy subjects has found that 24 to 40 h of total sleep deprivation causes either no [192, 193] or a generalized hyperalgesic effect [194] , with a return to baseline following a night of recovery sleep [195] .

For Alzheimer's disease and related dementia patients residing in healthcare facilities, lighting schemes that favor stimulating light with blue undertones in the morning appear to improve sleep time and efficiency [204] . Artificial light exposure during the daytime has been shown to decrease the incidence and duration of delirium [184] .

Impacts on the endocrine system such as glucose regulation and thermoregulation, in addition to potentially compounding the effect of sleep deprivation on preexisting neurological injury in neuropsychological domains, are particularly relevant in the NeuroICU population. Several straightforward interventions are possible to improve patient sleep quality and quantity. It should be noted that the major limitation of this review is the paucity of data derived from the NeuroICU patient population.
