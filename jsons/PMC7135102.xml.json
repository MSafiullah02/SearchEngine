Multiple studies have shown it to be underdiagnosed and undertreated.15\nLegionella spp cause an array of respiratory illnesses but this article focuses on SCAP and nosocomial infections. SCAP is operationally defined as community-acquired pneumonia of sufficient severity to warrant ICU care for ventilatory and/or hemodynamic support. Delayed diagnosis of legionellosis is partly related to the lack of readily accessible diagnostic tools to help with early identification of legionella infection. The clinical manifestations and radiographic findings are nonspecific and do not accurately distinguish L pneumophila from other respiratory pathogens. In addition, typical empiric antibiotic therapy often lacks proper antimicrobial coverage against Legionella.16 Several clinical and laboratory abnormalities have been linked in the past to the diagnosis of legionellosis. These abnormalities include hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, increased liver enzyme levels, acute mental status changes, headache, diarrhea, early onset of pleuritic pain (sometimes confused with a pulmonary embolus), and acute increase in creatine phosphokinase level. However, follow-up clinical studies have been largely unsuccessful in reliably identifying and verifying clinical and laboratory parameters that are specific for legionella infection. Note that hyponatremia has been a fairly reproducible indictor of severe legionellosis in several studies. Individually, clinical and laboratory abnormalities lack diagnostic specificity. Nonetheless, the specificity of clinical and laboratory findings is increased when those parameters are combined5 (Table 2\n). Respiratory symptoms tend to be less prominent initially in patients with legionnaire\u2019s disease.17, 18, 19, 20\n",

Pulse rate usually increases by about 15 beats/min for every 1\u00b0C increase in body temperature. Faget sign has been frequently described in older adult patients with more severe pneumonia19 but this finding is not highly specific for legionellosis. Gastrointestinal manifestations such as watery diarrhea and sudden abdominal pain can sometimes be the presenting symptoms in patients with legionella pneumonia. Another clue to the possibility of SCAP from legionellosis is the finding of numerous neutrophils on Gram strain of respiratory specimens with the absence of visible bacteria.

Mild pharyngeal injection with minimal or no cervical adenopathy can be seen with mycoplasma pneumonia, but upper respiratory tract symptoms are not common with legionella infections. Mycoplasma pneumoniae has long been associated with bullous myringitis, but recent literature has disproved this association.26 Similar to legionella pneumonia, atypical pneumonia with mycoplasma can be associated with extrapulmonary symptoms such as myalgia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Mycoplasma is frequently associated with additional cardiovascular abnormalities such as myocarditis, pericarditis, and heart block.27 Such cardiac manifestations are not commonly seen in legionella infections. Mycoplasma infection has been associated with several skin manifestations, including erythema multiforme, macular and vesicular exanthems, urticaria, erythema nodosum, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.28 Dermatologic findings are uncommon in legionella pneumonia.",

            "text": "A recent randomized controlled study found that low-dose corticosteroid therapy was effective in treating community-acquired pneumonia.50 A series of recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have appeared in the literature recently that indicate that steroids might be of some benefit in community-acquired pneumonia.51, 52, 53, 54 However, there are no specific data for the effect of corticosteroids in legionella pneumonia. One case study reported that using high-dose corticosteroid is effective for treating severe legionella pneumonia,55 but sufficient data are not available to validate the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of SCAP caused by Legionella spp. Further observational studies, or preferably controlled trials, will be needed to justify the use of glucocorticoids, with their attendant risks, in this clinical setting.",

In another study, SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) II score higher than 46, duration of symptoms before ICU admission longer than 5 days, and intubation were associated with increased mortality.56 The same study also suggested that early initiation of fluoroquinolone therapy within 8 hours of ICU admission reduces mortality. With early initiation of appropriate antibiotics, mortality decreases to less than 5%.14 Delay in initiation of appropriate antibiotics is associated with a worse prognosis.57 Treatment failure tends to occur in patients with severe disease at the time of admission41 or in immune compromised patients.58 Legionellosis can leave patients with long-term adverse health effects and morbidity. In one study, survivors of severe legionella pneumonia reported persisting fatigue (75%), neurologic symptoms (66%), and neuromuscular symptoms (63%) at 17 months\u2019 follow-up.59 The same study also reported that health-related quality of life (HRQL) was impaired in 7 of the 8 dimensions assessed by the HRQL questionnaire, and 15% of patients reported symptoms of PTSD.",
