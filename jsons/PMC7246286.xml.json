The program was initiated under the guidance of Randy Ott, Director of the Center for Academic Success Programs. RTW was designed to target first and second-year students who were dismissed from the University in the spring semester. At this University students are placed on probation after one semester with a cumulative GPA below 2.0. If they do not obtain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 after being placed on probation for one semester, they will be academically dismissed from the University at the end of their second semester. However, if students earn a semester GPA of 2.0 or above but their cumulative GPA remains below 2.0, they are placed on extended probation and can remain enrolled in the University. Students remain on extended probation until their cumulative GPA is 2.0 or higher or they are academically dismissed from the University for earning a semester GPA below 2.0.",

At the end of each spring semester, RTW administrators receive a list of all students who were academically dismissed from the University. They invite students to apply for the RTW program based on their cumulative GPA being between 1.0 and 1.9. Students must submit a written essay detailing the issues that led to their dismissal from the University and engage in a conversation with RTW administrators as a condition of being readmitted. A team composed of RTW administrators and staff evaluates all applications for the program.",

Typically, there have been three to four RTW sections each fall semester with an average of 17 students in each class. Since its inception in 2014, 266 students have participated in the RTW program. Of these students, 16 (6%) have completed their degree requirements and received their bachelor\u2019s degree, while another 17 (6%) have applied to graduate this academic year. Of the remaining students, 93 (34%) of RTW students are currently enrolled at the University. The final 140 students have either been academically dismissed or left the University for other reasons (e.g., finances, health issues, transfer to another institution).",

This approach is consistent with calls for higher education researchers to align their practices with student development theory and research as well as to incorporate students\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 perspectives (Kuh, Kinzie, Buckley, Bridges, & Hayek, 2006). Prior to the development of the E2 intervention in 2018, RTW instructors were given freedom to design their specific section of the RTW course. A review of syllabi from previous courses taught within the RTW program reveals that common topics covered in the class included time management, study strategies, test-taking skills, and learning strategies. Our team wanted to build upon the academic instruction provided to students in the RTW program over the previous four years. However, our goal was to link the new E2 intervention to established higher education theory and research as well as contextual information from the University\u2019s at-risk students.",

Collaborative academic recovery interventions between academic and student affairs units deliver the best results for students, particularly when working with marginalized students and those who are at-risk for poor postsecondary outcomes (LePeau, 2015). LePeau argued that these efforts to work with at-risk students should be grounded in available research.

Thus, the literature review focuses on this area. Although all students can enroll in and benefit from student success courses, they have been identified as a particularly useful intervention for at-risk students at both two-year and four-year institutions (Connolly, Flynn, Jemmott, & Oestreicher, 2017; Kimbark, Peters, & Richardson, 2017). Generally, student success courses are designed to provide structure and support for students, identify early concerns they may have, and connect them to appropriate on-campus resources (Hoops, Yu, Burridge, & Wolters, 2015). Students glean information about goal setting, study habits and skills, learning styles, time management, and test-taking skills to facilitate their success in college. Addressing deficits in these areas is critical for academically vulnerable students.",

In their meta-analysis of 284 independent samples focused on the effectiveness of first-year seminars, Permzadian and Cred\u00e9 (2016) found that student success courses had a small positive effect on students\u2019 first year GPA and retention. The authors noted that, while this difference was statistically small, it has important implications for interventions within an educational context. Likewise, in their synthesis of over 1,800 empirical studies of undergraduate students\u2019 experiences, Mayhew, Rockenbach, Bowman, Seifert, and Wolniak (2016) found that first-year student success courses had a stronger effect on academic achievement and retention for academically underprepared students compared to their peers who reported stronger academic preparation for college. Mayhew et al. revealed that academic interventions are more effective if they pair these courses with tutoring or support services outside of the classroom.",

Additionally, these researchers have argued that few studies explore how participation in student success courses influences other academically relevant variables (e.g., students\u2019 engagement).

While sparse, extant studies present limited but promising results. In their quasi-experimental study with students on probation enrolled in a student success program at a large, public university, McGrath and Burd (2012) found that students who participated in the student success course had higher rates of getting off academic probation and evidenced higher persistence and graduation rates compared to their peers who had not taken the course. Lizzio and Wilson (2013) reported that providing structured feedback to first-year students who had failed coursework contributed to their achieving both higher short-term success (i.e., improved grades on in-class assignments) and long-term success (i.e., passing the course).

I'll meet with her twice a week. I would not have passed math first semester if it wasn\u2019t for her. She's my same peer mentor this semester. It's that one-on-one; I need that personally.

One participant explained, \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed response. I have some teachers who are willing to help, but then I have some of the other teachers where [they say], \u2018Oh yeah, you can figure it out.\u2019\u201d When academically at-risk students like those in the RTW program encounter faculty or staff members who are perceived as not being helpful to them when they seek academic support, they may be more likely to get discouraged and not actively work to locate alternative sources of support.

And most of my Hispanic family didn\u2019t go to college or finish high school, so that\u2019s really kind of motivating me to focus on school.Other students shared how their social identities affected their interactions with faculty and peers. For example, students detailed how their status as visible minorities at the predominately White institution influenced their peer relationships and their sense of belonging in the classroom and on campus. For example, one student noticed that his White peers \u201cfeel more comfortable around each other. They talk to each other about assignments and whatnot.

And they were [saying], \u2018I\u2019m going to be a corporate, corporate White guy, CEO, stuff like this and, you know, you\u2019re going to be the woman being the assistant.\u2019 And when he said that you're going to be the assistant, so basically not making me eligible to be the CEO.

Taken together, students in the focus groups felt that they lacked the necessary academic skills when they entered college and had to seek on-campus resources to deal with gaps in their academic preparation. Accessing these resources did not automatically ensure their success given the differences in the quality of the resources utilized, and students have to be able to persist in their efforts to find helpful resources. Additionally, students recognized that their different social identities affected their experiences on campus.

I don\u2019t know how to read a textbook, understand it.

They noted that students were often dealing with multiple issues that directly and indirectly influenced their academic performance. One administrator reported that some students\u2019 efforts to balance their family\u2019s expectations contributed to their academic struggles:[Parents] pushing students into majors that they may not be passionate about because it makes more money. I see a lot of that from our students so they get stuck in this cycle of doing poorly and struggling, and that adds to their stress.They also discussed how family issues, mental and physical health problems, and financial concerns represented other non-academic concerns that affected at-risk students they served. One staff member reported that their students were juggling multiple responsibilities that inhibited their engagement on campus:They are the responsible one in their family, so they have a hard time leaving that behind and being the college student on-campus because they may still be driving back and forth to take brothers and sisters to school in the morning or whatever they have to do. I think that\u2019s hard for them too.In the final theme, professionals focused on the impact of students\u2019 social identities on their engagement. They highlighted how students\u2019 social identities affected their perceptions of cultural fit and sense of belonging at the University. One staff member explained that students struggled to develop a sense of belonging during their transition to college.One of my students described coming here was a culture shock for her. There wasn\u2019t [sic] enough [Black] people. She\u2019s never been in a place where she was literally the minority and being in the classroom with 200 and something people and you\u2019re the only African American person sitting in there. That scared her, and she felt like she didn\u2019t belong here. She felt like a lot of the clubs and organizations that were geared for her were very few, and she just felt like it wasn\u2019t the place for her to be, and she was thinking about going to an HBCU for those reasons.Professional staff noted that they worked to get students more engaged by helping them to navigate experiences of being either first generation, low income, or a student of color in higher education by addressing students\u2019 \u201cexposure gaps.\u201d One staff member commented that many students \u201cdon\u2019t get to know people in positions of power on campus. They don\u2019t go out. They stay in their bubbles and don\u2019t branch out to expand their networks beyond their friends.\u201d These professionals noted that students\u2019 pre-existing beliefs may lead to lower engagement on campus. One administrator reported that he worked with students to address their worries:[Some underrepresented students deal with the] fear of doing something different from what you\u2019ve already done or what you\u2019ve been exposed to, especially when it comes to Study Abroad or going to an organization that you wouldn\u2019t have thought to go to because of the benefits that it can add to your skillset.By addressing knowledge gaps created by students\u2019 first generation or low income status as well as their experiences as racial minorities at the institution, these professionals worked to build relationships with students and help them connect with culturally relevant and supportive resources on campus.

Prior research has encouraged researchers to include the voices of multiple stakeholders when crafting student-centered interventions (LePeau, 2015). The inclusion of data from the four focus groups ensured that our intervention incorporated contextual factors that may affect students in the RTW program. By gathering the perspectives of both at-risk students as well as the professionals tasked with facilitating their academic success prior to creating the intervention, we were able to tailor the intervention specifically to the at-risk students in the RTW program. Given that both groups identified similar factors contributing to students\u2019 academic challenges, we were able to hone in on these areas and increase buy-in from students and professional stakeholders. Other programs may benefit from taking a similar approach as they create new academic interventions. This early buy-in can help to generate a shared problem statement and lead to a more cohesive plan that does not rely exclusively on certain stakeholders\u2019 perspectives of the problem.",

Compared to other at-risk students on campus, students in the RTW program are unique since they are being readmitted to the institution after they failed to make adequate academic progress for multiple semesters on campus and were academically dismissed. The stressors associated with these chronic academic struggles not only affect students\u2019 academic self-concept and motivation; they can also affect them psychologically and emotionally. Our findings suggest that this subset of students requires supplemental academic skills development and support beyond what is typically offered during most students\u2019 first semester or year on campus.

These out-of-class activities can be both formal and informal. Formal out-of-class activities include involvement with student organizations, volunteer opportunities, and extracurricular activities. Informal out-of-class activities involve any activities that are not formally organized by the institution but that allow students to engage with each other (Quaye & Harper, 2015). Social engagement incorporates student-faculty interactions, such as visiting professors in their offices and talking with professors before or after class. Also, we assess the impact of cultural variables on social climate and engagement for diverse students in the intervention (Quaye & Harper, 2015). Social engagement is being evaluated using weekly behavioral trackers as well as using measures on social engagement attitudes.",

For example, similar to group counseling process, students \u201ccheck in\u201d at the beginning of each class period. During their check-ins, they share about successes and challenges from the previous week or for the upcoming week. The instructor and classmates can ask clarifying questions and give encouraging words. Students can also request additional class time to discuss and receive feedback about any pressing concerns affecting their academic performance. This open sharing at the start of every class period helps to normalize the act of seeking help and allows students to recognize their common academic challenges, which can reduce the stigma for doing so. It also allows students to support each other\u2019s victories from the previous week and hold each other accountable if they are not reaching their established engagement goals. Additionally, students can learn to recognize maladaptive academic behaviors in themselves and others and hear about resources that helped their peers address their academic problems.",

Using the classroom as an academic group counseling session, the instructor of the course uses their psychological training to begin helping students to address the multifaceted problems they are facing without having them visit the University\u2019s counseling center immediately. Students\u2019 non-academic concerns, such as mental health, family stressors, financial barriers, and adjustment concerns, can be discussed in the check-ins as well as in the assigned readings for the course (Beattie, Lalibert\u00e9, Michaud-Leclerc, & Oreopoulos, 2019). This counseling group approach reduces the separation of students\u2019 academic challenges from the broader issues that they face and allows students\u2019 problems to be diagnosed and treated earlier. Using the group counseling format in the classroom, students continue to receive traditional instruction on academic skills, such as time management, procrastination, and study skills, given that our focus groups revealed that these deficits were a concern for at-risk students at our University. However, it also allows this subset of academically at-risk students to receive assistance in identifying and removing barriers to their full academic and social engagement on campus.",

This second cohort of RTW students from fall 2019 will be tracked and assessed over a 2-year time span to gather enough data in order to evaluate the statistical significance of the E2 intervention for RTW students. We will assess outcomes including whether the E2 intervention helps students\u2019 increase their GPA, transition off academic probation, and achieve junior level status at the University. Additionally, we will analyze the engagement patterns of students in the fall 2018 and 2019 sections of the E2 classes of RTW students with their peers in the two other fall 2018 and 2019 sections of students in the RTW program. Students in the other two sections of the RTW classes will serve as a treatment-as-usual control group. We have collected background information for all students in the fall 2018 and 2019 cohorts so that their academic profiles prior to their entry into the University can be compared.

Additionally, the use of a control group allows us to account for the volunteer effect for the students who elect to apply for the RTW program.

Additionally, another strength of the E2 intervention is the use of a group counseling approach in the classroom, which integrates multi-dimensional factors for improving the academic outcomes of at-risk students. Its integration of the strengths of counseling psychologists, student affairs personnel, and other higher education professionals allows it to more flexibly address the problems academically dismissed students encounter. This approach can shift how academic recovery courses are designed and delivered.
