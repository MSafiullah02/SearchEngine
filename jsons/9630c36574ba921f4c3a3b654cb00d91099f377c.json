Although there is much information about the molecular biology of the viruses that cause the common cold and flu syndromes, there is relatively little research on the immunological, physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in generating the symptoms. This chapter studies the mechanisms that cause local symptoms associated with local inflammation of the airway (sore throat, sneezing, rhinorrhoea and purulent nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sinus pain, watery eyes and cough), and the mechanisms that cause systemic symptoms associated with release of cytokines from leukocytes (headache, chilliness and fever, psychological effects, malaise and mood changes, loss of appetite, and muscle aches and pains).",

            "text": "Common cold and flu are common syndromes of illness that are self-diagnosed on the basis of a grouping of familiar symptoms such as sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, fever and muscle aches [1] . In terms of common knowledge, the common cold is associated with a mild illness with symptoms usually restricted to the nose and throat (a head cold), whereas flu is perceived as a more severe systemic illness with fever and muscle aches. People often go to work with a cold but phone in sick with flu. This chapter focuses on the physiological mechanisms that generate the symptoms of common cold and flu, rather than the viruses involved in the syndromes, as these are discussed elsewhere in the book. The common cold and flu syndromes are related to viral infection of the upper respiratory tract (URTI) and, although they are commonly self-diagnosed, they are difficult to define exactly because of the great variation in the severity, duration and types of symptoms. Although common cold viruses are responsible for a lot of morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries where malnutrition may weaken the host response to infection, the common cold syndrome is usually understood as a self-limiting mild illness, and complications of common cold infections are usually described by other terms such as sinusitis, otitis media, laryngitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, etc. The common cold syndrome has been defined in terms of experimental colds, as a short mild illness with early symptoms of headache, sneezing, chilliness and sore throat and later symptoms of nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough and malaise [2] .",

The early symptoms consisted of headache, sneezing, chilliness and malaise and they developed quickly and also declined rapidly after 1 or 2 days of duration, whereas the later symptoms consisted of malaise, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction and cough, and these symptoms developed slowly over several days and they were still present 1 week after challenge. The time course of an early symptom (sneezing) is compared with that of a later symptom (cough) in Figure 1 . The early development of sneezing compared to cough in cases of common cold may be explained on the basis that URTI develops in the upper airways first and subsequently Figure 1 .

Pathogenesis is based on physiological, biochemical or molecular mechanisms that lead to harmful effects for the host, for example depletion of its resources, tissue destruction and detrimental changes in behaviour [6] . Common cold can be considered a mildly pathogenic illness as there is little evidence of any tissue destruction in the airways associated with colds [7] , but there can be effects on behaviour and mood [8] that reduce performance and may cause loss of work days or school days. The presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, muscle aches and pains, tiredness and anorexia is associated with the flu syndrome, and this may be caused by both common cold viruses and influenza viruses as there is much overlap in the clinical presentation of these infections. The best predictors for influenza are cough and fever, as this combination of symptoms has been shown to have a positive predictive value of around 80% in differentiating influenza from a population suffering from flu-like symptoms [5] .",

However, it seems unlikely that the parasite-host interaction will finally evolve to a completely harmless infection without any symptoms, as the symptoms may be important in aiding transmission of common cold and influenza viruses. A common cold or flu virus that causes a sub-clinical infection is unlikely to succeed in transmission to other hosts, as viruses spread in airway mucus, and in order for the chain of transmission to be complete, virus-laden mucus must pass from one airway to another [10] . The most successful common cold viruses are likely to be those that cause the most nasal mucus secretions, and coughs and sneezes may also aid in transmission of this mucus, although hand to hand contact is also an important mechanism of infection [11] . Symptomatic medicines that reduce mucus secretions and coughs and sneezing in colds and flu such as antihistamines, anticholinergics, and antitussives, may have a role in reducing transmission of colds but at present there are no studies to test this idea.",

            "text": "Common cold and flu symptoms are caused by the immune response to the infection rather than by tissue damage [12, 13] . Histological surveys of the nasal epithelium during experimental rhinovirus infections have not been able to find any morphological changes in the nasal epithelium of infected volunteers apart from a significant increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes early in the course of the infection [7] . The major cell monitoring the host for viral infection is the macrophage and this cell has the ability to trigger an acute-phase response when stimulated with components of viruses such as viral RNA. The surface of the macrophage exhibits Toll-like receptors that combine with the components of viral and bacterial pathogens and trigger the production of cytokines [14] . The cytokines act to recruit other immune cells, trigger inflammation, and generate systemic symptoms such as fever [15] . A complex mix of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators generates the symptoms of URTI [16] . The inflammatory mediator bradykinin is believed to play a major role in generating the local symptoms of URTI, such as sore throat and nasal congestion [17, 18] , and cytokines are believed to be responsible for the systemic symptoms such as fever [19] . The mechanisms generating symptoms of URTI are illustrated in Figure 2 . They can be divided into two pathways: one for systemic symptoms generated by cytokines and the other for local symptoms generated by a local inflammatory response in the infected airway. A discussion of the mechanisms that generate the symptoms of common cold and flu is the topic of this chapter and each symptom is discussed in turn.",

The modalities of sensation detected by the cranial nerves include pain in conditions such as sore throat and sinus pain, pressure in the case of nasal congestion, and irritation in the case of sneezing. However, some of the sensations associated with URTI symptoms are poorly understood, such as the sensation of irritation associated with cough, and the urge to cough, and the sensation of chilliness that is commonly felt with URTI.

The sensation of throat irritation is an early symptom of common cold but this minor symptom may develop into sore throat pain associated with nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis or tonsillitis, and these conditions may also be associated with bacterial infection [20] . The sensation of throat irritation is likely caused by the formation of bradykinin and prostaglandins in the airway in response to infection, as intranasal administration of bradykinin causes symptoms of rhinitis and a sore throat [17, 21] . Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as aspirin and paracetamol are effective treatments for sore throat pain [22] .

Sneezing is a reflex that, unlike cough, cannot be initiated voluntarily and it consists of nasal congestion accompanied by a watery secretion and a violent expiration through the mouth and nose. Sneezing is related to inflammatory responses in the nose and nasopharynx that stimulate the trigeminal nerves. The sneeze response may be mediated via histamine receptors on the trigeminal nerves as intranasal administration of histamine causes sneezing [26] . A sneeze is an all-or-nothing patterned response generated from the sneeze centre in the brainstem. The trigeminal nerves relay information to the sneeze centre and cause reflex activation of motor and parasympathetic branches of the facial nerve, and activate respiratory muscles. A model of the sneeze reflex is illustrated in Figure 3 . The sneeze centre coordinates the patterned inspiratory and expiratory actions of sneezing via respiratory muscles, and lacrimation, nasal secretion via parasympathetic branches of the facial nerve. The eyes are always closed during sneezing by the activation of facial muscles, and this indicates a close relationship between the protective reflexes of the nose and eyes. A common phenomenon is the 'photic sneeze' caused by a sudden increase in light intensity that again highlights the overlap of protective nasal and eye reflexes [27, 28] . Sneezing activates parasympathetic pathways to nasal glands to cause a watery nasal secretion that may help to cleanse the nose of irritants, and there appears to be some cholinergic central control of sneezing, as anticholinergics such as ipratropium [29] and first generation antihistamines [30] have been shown to inhibit sneezing.",

Much of the literature relates to colour changes in sputum and the lower airways but the same concepts apply to the upper airways and nasal discharge. The colour of nasal discharge may change from clear to yellow to green during the course of URTI and this colour change is related to the recruitment of leukocytes into the airway lumen and it is a hallmark of airway disease [35] . Neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes have azurophil granules that owe their green colour to the green protein myeloperoxidase. Nasal discharge with few leukocytes is white or clear, with increasing numbers of leukocytes the nasal discharge appears yellow (pale green) and with large numbers of leukocytes the colour becomes green [35] .",

Figure 5 . Factors that influence the patient's perception of nasal congestion. Nasal resistance to airflow is mainly determined by the cross-sectional area of the nasal valve region at the tip of the inferior turbinate. The patient's perception of nasal congestion may be influenced by air temperature and stimulation of cold receptors in the airway. Congestion in the ethmoid area, ostia of paranasal sinuses and Eustachian tube causes a perception of congestion and obstruction that is unrelated to any change in nasal airway resistance as these areas are distant from the nasal valve.",

The origin of sinus pain may be related to several factors such as pressure changes in the sinus air space, and pressure changes in the blood vessels draining the sinus [47] . The ostia of the paranasal sinuses are often occluded as the nasal epithelium becomes inflamed and congested with URTI, and this may result in gas absorption from the sinus and 'vacuum maxillary sinusitis' [37, 48] .

Any irritant that enters the nose is likely to enter the eyes, hence the closure of the eyes and increased tearing associated with sneezing. The nasolacrimal duct may be obstructed at its opening into the nose by inflammation and congestion of blood vessels in the nasal epithelium around the opening of the duct, and this will cause an accumulation of tears and the symptom of watery eyes. The nasolacrimal duct has been shown to have a vascular plexus of veins (cavernous tissue) similar to the venous sinuses of the nasal epithelium, and congestion of this plexus causes obstruction of the duct [50] . The nasolacrimal duct cavernous tissue is supplied by autonomic nerves that may control the patency of the duct [51] , so that during sneezing and tearing the parasympathetic nerves lead to duct congestion that restricts the drainage of tears and causes watery eyes.",

Headache is a common side effect of administration of IFN-1a for the treatment of multiple sclerosis [63] and similarly headache is associated with therapy with PEGylated IFN-2b for treatment of hepatitis [64] . Cytokine levels have been shown to be raised in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during periods of headache but the increases are modest compared to other neurological conditions [65] . The mechanism of headache caused by cytokines is unknown but it is interesting that the headache induced by cytokines is accompanied by symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, malaise, nausea and depression, and these symptoms are commonly associated with URTI. Cytokines increase the levels of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) in the brain and CSF and it is likely that prostaglandins are involved in headache, perhaps as a final mediator, as prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen are the standard treatments for headache.",

Common cold in an adult is rarely accompanied by fever and some subjects have a transient fall in oral temperature during the early stages of common cold. In a study on 272 patients with sore throat associated with URTI, the mean aural temperature was 36.8\u00b0C and around 35% of these patients said they were suffering from 'chills' and 'feverish discomfort' [22] . Although it is generally accepted that skin cold-receptors signal the sensation of cold, the sensation of chilliness associated with URTI may be due to a central effect of cytokines and be unrelated to skin temperature. In a study on human volunteers, a sensation of chill still developed on administration of exogenous pyrogen even though the volunteers were immersed in a water bath that maintained a neutral skin temperature (34.5\u00b0C) [68] . The sensation of chilliness occurred after visible signs of shivering in the volunteers. Chilliness and shivering occurred even though there was no change in skin temperature and body temperature was actually rising in response to skin vasoconstriction. This finding indicates that the sensation of chilliness may be a central sensation closely linked to control of shivering. Chilliness and shivering are most likely induced by the effects of cytokines on the temperature regulating centres of the hypothalamus, and perceived at the level of the cerebral cortex.",

IL-1 and IL-6 are believed to be the most important cytokines for inducing fever [71] . Cytokines are believed to cross the blood-brain barrier or interact with the vagus nerve endings to signal the temperature control centre in the ventromedial preoptic area (VPMO) of the hypothalamus to increase the thermal set point [71, 72] . The cytokines induce cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-dependent prostaglandin synthesis in the VPMO. The hypothalamus then initiates shivering, constriction of skin blood vessels, and a sensation of chilliness as illustrated in Figure 8 . Peripheral stimulation of intraperitoneal vagal nerve endings by inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins may also initiate fever via pathways in the nucleus tractus solitarius that link directly with the VPMO without the need for cytokines to penetrate the CNS [73] .",

Myalgia is a symptom of the acute-phase response to infection and there is evidence that this symptom is caused by the effects of cytokines on skeletal muscle [84] . Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been implicated as inducing the breakdown of muscle proteins, and TNF was initially referred to as 'cachetin' because of its role in causing mus- Figure 9 . Myalgia. Muscle aches and pains are caused by the breakdown of muscle and joint proteins caused by PGE 2 , which also stimulates pain nerve endings. PGE 2 production in muscles and joints is stimulated by cytokines released from macrophages and neutrophils in the airway epithelium. cle wasting or 'cachexia' [85] . The breakdown of muscle protein in response to URTI can be viewed as beneficial as it mobilises proteins and amino acids that can be converted in the liver to opsonins and other components of the immune response [85] as illustrated in Figure 9 . There is some evidence to indicate that myalgia associated with infection is related to the formation of PGE 2 in muscles and joints in response to circulating cytokines [84] . The cytokine-induced generation of PGE 2 and the breakdown of skeletal muscle in vitro is inhibited by indomethacin [84] and similarly myalgia associated with URTI is relieved with acetylsalicylic acid [22] .",
