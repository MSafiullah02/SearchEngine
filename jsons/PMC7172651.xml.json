In the context of cancer care, this has led to a dilemma amongst oncologists about whether to use corticosteroids as part of anticancer regimens, supportive care, and toxicity management. Here, we outline some guidance to health care professionals to assist with a risk-benefit analysis of corticosteroid therapy for uro-oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Physiological doses of corticosteroids are effective as a second-line hormonal treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen response rates to 0.5 mg of dexamethasone daily of over 40% [5]. Prednisolone at 5 mg twice daily is effective at preventing the hypermineralocorticoid dose-limiting toxicity of abiraterone, a life-prolonging CYP-17,20-lyase inhibitor. Notably, in a large (n = 1209), randomised, double-blind study where patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer received either abiraterone and prednisolone (give 5 mg twice daily for a median duration of 25.8 mo) or double placebo, there was no significant difference in the rate of infections between the two arms [6]. Low-dose steroids are also useful to treat cancer-associated constitutional symptoms such as anorexia, fatigue, and nausea.",

However, a more appropriate comparison is SARS-CoV-1, which is clinically and genetically closest to SARS-CoV-2 and for which corticosteroids were widely used during the 2003 SARS pandemic. Stockman et al [10] performed a systematic review of treatment effects in SARS patients. This included 29 separate studies reviewing corticosteroids comprising 21 retrospective, five prospective, one case-control, and two randomised control trials. The majority (25 studies) of studies demonstrated no convincing evidence of either benefit or detriment in clinical outcomes of patients with established SARS treated with corticosteroids [10]. The remaining studies indicated an increase in known toxicities [10].",

The risk of viral infections at physiological steroid doses would appear low for patients with progressive prostate cancer, and we are prescribing low-dose dexamethasone instead of palliative chemotherapy rationalising that this will be less immunosuppressive than chemotherapy and will hopefully control the disease until after the worst of the pandemic. High-dose steroids carry a theoretical susceptibility risk to COVID-19, but long-course treatments are deployed only for life-threatening complications where the need for treatment far outweighs a risk of viral susceptibility. Immune checkpoint inhibition may actually lead to improved antiviral immunity, and while we recognise the potential risks of needing high-dose steroids for toxicity, in bladder cancer we are prioritising first-line immunotherapy over chemotherapy in programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive patients. Hyperinflammation of the lung is a fatal complication of COVID-19, and whether corticosteroids are beneficial for this is the subject of on-going clinical trials. In a similar vein to fast-tracked respiratory expert guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence regarding corticosteroids for their usual indications (eg, exacerbation of asthma), we are not stopping or avoiding corticosteroids for cancer indications.",
