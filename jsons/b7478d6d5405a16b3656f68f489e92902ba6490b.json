The simulation, not only captures the model dynamic of the spread of the virus, but also, takes care of population and mobility data. The model is calibrated based on epidemic data and events specifically of Pakistan, which can easily be generalized. The simulation results are quite disturbing, indicating that, even with stringent social distancing and testing strategies and for a quite long time (even beyond one year), the spread would be significant (in tens of thousands). The real alarm is when some of these measures got leaked for a short time within this duration, which may result in catastrophic situation when millions of people would be infected.",

The fact that the rate of getting isolated in really low (alpha = 0.001), depicts that there is no effort yet put by the authorities to contain the epidemic. In the context of Pakistan, we have put a few cases in Islamabad, Karachi and Gilgit as the starting cases which are not yet got any symptoms, and ran the simulation for a year, starting from February, 26, 2020 (when a few such cases were reported in the above mentioned cities).
