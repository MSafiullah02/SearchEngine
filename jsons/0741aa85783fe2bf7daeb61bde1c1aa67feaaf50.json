In addition, decreases in CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells, and NK cells were also observed in the COVID-19 patients. These alterations were also found in patients with pneumonia caused by MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov [12] . In the study by Cui et al on SARS, the incidence of lymphopenia was 84%, CD4 + T cells decreased in 100% of patients, CD8 + T cells decreased in 87%, B cells decreased in 76%, and NK cells decrease in 55% [13] . In the study by Assiri et al on MERS, lymphopenia occurred in 34% of patients [14] . Lymphopenia might be caused by virus attachment or indirectly by immune injuries from inflammatory mediators. Moreover, exudation of circulating lymphocytes into inflammatory lung tissues might also lead to lymphopenia. Among COVID-19 patients, severe cases had a lower level of total lymphocytes, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and B cells than mild cases, which was similar to the alteration in SARS [15, 16] . CD8 + T-cell levels were negatively correlated with inflammatory indicators ESR, CRP, and IL-6, while the CD4 + /CD8 + ratio was positively correlated. Total lymphocyte and CD4 + T-cell levels were negatively associated with ESR, and NK cells were negatively correlated with IL-6. These findings indicate a more obvious change in CD8 + T cells than in other lymphocyte subsets after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, lymphocytes and their subsets, especially CD8 + T cells, might be a potential predictor for disease severity and clinical efficacy in COVID-19.",

However, these findings might be confounded by therapeutic factors. First, the lympholytic effects of corticosteroid could reduce the lymphocytes directly [17] . For the patients with corticosteroid treatment, the recovery of lymphocyte population might be weakened by the lympholytic effects of corticosteroid. Thus, we conducted a multivariate analysis to evaluate the effects of these potential confounders, and identified posttreatment decrease in CD8 + T cells and B cells and increase in CD4 + /CD8 + ratio as independent predictors for poor clinical efficacy, especially CD8 + T cells. Moreover, we also found that corticosteroid treatment increased total lymphocytes significantly in comparison to the patients without corticosteroid treatment. The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroid might have contributed to the posttreatment increase in lymphocytes, which outweighed the lympholytic effects of corticosteroid. Importantly, CD8 + T cells have been shown to play a critical role in mediating viral clearance after acute respiratory infections of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (IAV), and human metapneumovirus [18, 19] . In animal experiments, the transfer of RSV-or IAV-immune CD8 + T cells into athymic mice significantly reduced viral titers [20, 21] . As in our results, cytotoxic immunity was involved in antiviral processes and the recovery of cytotoxic immune function (particularly CD8 + T cells) might be a reliable indicator of disease severity and recovery.",
