We have been fighting with the novel coronavirus for more than 50 days in Iran. COVID 19 mortality rate is higher in cancer patients (2) , and COVID 19 pandemic poses severe challenges in the treatment of cancer patients. At the onset of the outbreak, discontinuation, or postponing, the non-emergent treatments were considered. However, as time passes, we realize that COVID 19 is not a short-term crisis. Estimates are suggesting a longlasting pandemic, perhaps for months. Therefore, it is not logical to deprive patients of lifesaving treatments. Besides, quarantine policy in our country and many parts of the world are different from China. People have different levels of exposure with the novel coronavirus, and some patients may have a higher chance of receiving necessary, timely, and effective treatments.",
