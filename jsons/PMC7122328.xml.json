This challenge might have succeeded, but for the intervention of a local civil society group called the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) who alerted the international network of civil society groups in this field and won the right to present their case in court. Protests grew around the world and in the face of this the pharmaceutical firms withdrew their challenge. As a result the legislation was applied more widely than had originally been intended, particularly in relation to HIV/AIDS medicines and other countries followed South Africa\u2019s lead in passing similar measures.",

It was not until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003\u20132004 that sufficient political priority was forthcoming.

But it is not a simple matter to introduce a new issue to the crowded agenda of global health diplomacy. Moreover the way in which an issue is framed, how it is identified and the policy context in which it is viewed is crucial to subsequent global health negotiations.

As a consequence negotiations on the application of paragraphs 4\u20136 of the Doha Declaration that permit the compulsory licensing of drugs (circumventing patent rights) in response to threats to public health considered to be a national emergency or other circumstance of extreme urgency must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis in the light of local conditions (see Box 5).\n",

This was accepted at the WHA meeting of 2000. An International Negotiating Board (INB) was formed which negotiated the wording of the convention over two years. In 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was adopted by the WHA, the convention came into effect in 2005 after 40-member states had signed, often following internal dialogue. By 2010, 168 countries had signed, 15 of these including the USA have yet to bring the FCTC into national laws by formal ratification.",

Brazil was the second country to introduce graphic warnings on cigarette packs, it has a history of awareness raising and controls on tobacco stretching back to 1990. Its programme of public engagement and working with civil society organizations to reduce smoking rates is regarded as exemplary and perhaps for this reason and because of the growing importance of emerging countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa in international fora\u2014and as target markets for tobacco companies, Brazil was invited to chair the INB.

It is important for the formula to be kept relatively simple but with sufficient scope to allow all parties to benefit from the eventual agreement.

Despite the strong institutional and personal support for South Africa\u2019s position by Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland of the WHO, it was felt that the pharmaceutical companies would win their appeal against the Act and fearing this implementation of the act was suspended. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association seemed certain to win, they even appeared to have the backing of Kofi Annan, the EU and the USA.",

Working with international gay and lesbian groups and the support of NGOs led by Ellen\u2019t Hoen of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res they built a worldwide campaign for access to medicines that ensured that Clinton and Annan shifted their rhetoric and European Countries began to back down.

This can help to prepare for the time when the issue is ripe for resolution, perhaps as a result of unfolding events or as a shared understanding of common interests and concerns for global public goods emerges. The formula for the resolution of issues including consideration of the form and nature of any international agreement and the terms in which it can be resolved is crucial to successful negotiation of an agreement. But even when formal agreement is reached diplomatic negotiations centred on the international agency responsible for monitoring the agreement are likely to continue. Such negotiations shape the roles and regimes of the international agencies and are the essential basis for global governance for health. While this calls for shared organization leadership at every level it also depends upon on the personal leadership qualities of key individuals.",
