A double-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) provides the added benefit of isolating the nonoperative lung and airways from any bleeding, which may occur during a potentially bloody resection. The risk of significant bleeding is decreased if the lesion has been embolized before resection. Large-bore intravenous (IV) access is recommended in the event significant hemorrhage occurs. An arterial catheter is also indicated to monitor oxygenation and guide resuscitative efforts. As mentioned, an important anesthetic goal is to minimize flow through the pulmonary AV fistula. AV fistulas do not have capillary beds and have lower resistance to blood flow than normal pulmonary vasculature. It is important to avoid a general increase in PVR because this will increase flow through the AV fistula. Similarly, minimizing the use of PEEP will minimize increases in PVR and help minimize blood flow through the fistula. Because of the risk of paradoxical emboli passing through the fistula, extra caution must be taken to avoid injection of any air or particulate material into the venous system, because such debris may bypass the pulmonary capillary bed and gain access to systemic arteries, where end-organ embolization can occur (Box 4-3\n).Box 4-3Anesthesia Concerns for Patients with Pulmonary DiseasePulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula\nAssess for degree of shunt and hypoxemia.Avoid increases in pulmonary vascular resistance.Avoid elevated positive end-expiratory pressures.Extra care is needed to prevent unintentional intravenous air injection or any condition that would result in a venous air embolism.\nWegener's Granulomatosis\nAssess for specific organ system involvement (renal and pulmonary insufficiency).Avoid nasal manipulation (nasal intubation).Assess for risk of difficult airway (subglottic/tracheal stenosis).\nLymphomatoid Granulomatosis\nAssess extent of organ system involvement (obstructive or restrictive lung disease, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, myelosuppression).Possible adrenal suppression from long-term steroid treatment.\nChurg-Strauss Syndrome\nAssess level of organ system involvement (PFTs, chest radiograph, ECG, echocardiogram).Minimize airway manipulation secondary to airway hyperreactivity.May need stress-dose perioperative steroids.\nPrimary Pulmonary Hypertension\nConsider increased perioperative morbidity and mortality.Complete cardiopulmonary workup is needed for all procedures (ECG, echocardiography, chest radiograph, ABGs).Spinal anesthesia is not recommended.Maintain cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.Minimize increases in pulmonary vascular resistance.Consider invasive monitoring intraoperatively.Restrict nitrous oxide or ketamine use.\nABGs, Arterial blood gases; ECG, electrocardiogram; PFTs, pulmonary function tests.\n",

Cardiac involvement is uncommon, although pericarditis, coronary arteritis, valvular involvement, and left ventricular hypertrophy have been reported. Current therapy for WG is often based on disease severity but usually includes cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, methotrexate, or azathioprine and yields very good results, with long-term remission occurring in the majority of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated possible advantages of antistaphylococcal antibiotics and T-cell inhibitors (leflunomide).18 Preoperative assessment is directed toward evaluating potential complications of WG, most often renal and pulmonary insufficiency. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels will provide adequate insight into the patient's renal function. A pulmonary flow-volume loop may be indicated if the patient is suspected of having tracheal stenosis and, by providing information about the dynamic changes in tracheal caliber, can supplement static radiographic images. WG may cause either obstructive or restrictive lung disease; the latter can be severe. Spirometry and other PFTs such as formal lung volume measurements can help determine the severity of such disease.

A rapid decrease in O2 saturation on induction is common, making excellent preoxygenation and expeditious placement of the double-lumen ETT essential. An intra-arterial catheter is useful in monitoring the patient's oxygenation and hemodynamic response to the procedure. Confirmation of correct positioning of the ETT by fiberoptic visualization is essential. Testing for leaks that would allow contamination of the ventilated lung by spillage of lavage fluid is critical. The nonventilated lung is then lavaged repeatedly with saline while the ipsilateral chest wall is mechanically percussed. The procedure is repeated until the drained saline is almost clear, indicating removal of the majority of the lipoproteinaceous material. The BPL fluid should be warmed to decrease the risk of hypothermia and the volume of the drainage and presence of bubbles closely monitored, to ensure isolation of the contralateral lung. Oxygenation may improve during the instillation of fluid as alveolar pressure increases. This results in decreased perfusion to the lavaged lung (which is not being ventilated) and thus improves overall ventilation/perfusion matching. Hypoxia is most likely to occur during the drainage phases of the procedure, when an increase in intrapulmonary shunting occurs because of the dramatic drop in alveolar pressure. Significant hemodynamic changes can also occur during the infusion of saline into the lung. Hypotension and an increase in central venous pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure may be seen. TEE suggests these changes are caused by impaired venous return to the left side of the heart.45 Presumably, saline infusion compresses alveolar capillaries, increasing PVR and resulting in increased central venous pressure, while also causing decreased left-sided heart output because of decreased blood flow to the left ventricle. In some patients the contralateral lung can be lavaged during the same anesthesia, although several days may pass between treatments. BPL may result in improvement lasting 12 to 18 months before it is again required.",

IPF is a progressive illness with a median survival of 3 to 4 years. This rare condition has a prevalence of about 5 per 100,000 population and is more common in current or former smokers. A typical patient is a middle-aged man. Diagnosis is based on the histologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia and exclusion of other causes of this histologic pattern. Extrapulmonary involvement does not occur. The presentation is insidious and typically involves dyspnea and a nonproductive cough. Physical examination frequently reveals fine crackles at the lung bases, expanding upward as the disease progresses. Clubbing, cyanosis, peripheral edema, and cor pulmonale are later findings. There must be a restrictive pattern on spirometry and radiologic changes on chest radiography or high-resolution CT consistent with the diagnosis.61\n",

For procedures involving major fluid shifts, placement of a PAC or use of TEE may be helpful in guiding resuscitation and avoiding overzealous fluid administration, which might adversely impact the patient's respiratory status.

Recurrent leakage of lymph results in an impaired immune response and nutritional wasting, which increase the patient's risk of perioperative complications and should be addressed before surgery by enteral or parenteral nutritional support. For patients with advanced disease, ventilator management should be similar to that for a patient with severe emphysema, including prolonged expiratory time and avoidance of high inspiratory pressure.

Decreased range of motion and poor mouth opening can make direct laryngoscopy difficult, and excess force applied to the neck can result in cervical fracture. Atlantoaxial subluxation is also present in a subset of these patients.86 If advanced disease is present, an alternative and conservative approach to airway management (including an awake intubation) is strongly recommended, preferably one that maintains spontaneous ventilation. Adjuncts such as a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), videolaryngoscope, and fiberoptic bronchoscope should be readily available. Neuraxial anesthesia is very challenging in AkS patients.

Interscalene blocks can result in short-term ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and should be avoided. Higher peak pressures may occur with PPV and are expected. Adequate ventilation during laparoscopic surgery may not be possible, and hypercarbia may develop; if not excessive, it can be tolerated until the end of the procedure.

These procedures frequently involve significant blood loss, possible one-lung ventilation, and the need for deliberate hypotension. The patients have underlying pulmonary restrictive disease. All of these factors make arterial line placement and ABG analysis critical to effective perioperative management. The presence of restrictive lung disease combined with prone or lateral positioning can make oxygenation and ventilation with acceptable peak airway pressures challenging. The use of an anesthesia machine or ventilator capable of pressure control ventilation may be helpful. Based on the level of preoperative disability, the need for postoperative ventilation should be discussed with the patient and family. Of note, adequate oxygenation during one-lung ventilation for anterior thoracic approaches may be difficult. Placement of a double-lumen ETT instead of a bronchial blocker offers the advantage of delivering passive oxygenation to the nonventilated lung. However, such tubes have the disadvantage of needing to switch to a single-lumen ETT at the end of the procedure if postoperative ventilation is required. Improvement in the patient's pulmonary function does not occur immediately after surgery, and any improvement may take months to several years, depending on the procedure.91\n",

Controversy surrounds the preferred anesthetic agents with SSEP monitoring. The literature is frequently contradictory, and institutional preferences vary greatly, although propofol infusions and nitrous oxide are popular.

Goldiner et al.95 implicated hyperoxia and fluid overload as increasing the risk of perioperative pulmonary morbidity and mortality in patients who received bleomycin. Although subsequent studies have questioned these guidelines, there is no reason to believe that providing a higher fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio\n2) than that needed to maintain adequate oxygenation is of any benefit to these patients. The one exception to this is during preoxygenation, which is relatively brief, before induction of general anesthesia.94 When adequate oxygenation does require an Fio\n2 greater than 30%, use of PEEP may facilitate oxygen action without necessitating higher levels of Fio\n2. Fluid therapy should be conservative, with the goal of maintaining adequate intravascular volume and avoiding excess fluid administration. There is no evidence to support the use of colloid instead of crystalloid in bleomycin patients. When significant blood loss or significant fluid shifts are expected in surgery, intra-arterial and central venous catheters may be helpful. There is no clear answer as to how long after completion of therapy with bleomycin a patient continues to be at risk for pulmonary fibrosis, although minimizing Fio\n2 for 1 to 2 years would seem prudent (Box 4-13\n).Box 4-13Anesthesia Concerns for Patients with Bleomycin Toxicity\nAssess cardiopulmonary function.Use conservative fluid resuscitation.Minimize fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio\n2).Ensure aggressive postoperative pulmonary care.\n",
