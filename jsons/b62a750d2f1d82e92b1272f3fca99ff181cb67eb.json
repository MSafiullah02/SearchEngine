CD13/ aminopeptidase N (APN) is a Type II membrane-bound metalloproteinase (Mr 150,000), which cleaves amino terminal residues of biologically active peptides, such as enkephalins, angiotensins, neurokinins, and cytokines. APN is expressed in various epithelial cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. CD13/APN originally was described as a lineage-specific marker for leukemias. 1 The appearance of CD13/APN coincides with commitment to myeloid lineage, and APN is expressed exclusively on normal and leukemic progeny of myeloid cells within the hematopoietic compartment. It also has been reported that APN is a receptor for coronavirus 229E, which is implicated in the etiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome. 2 Recent studies showed that APN is expressed at high levels in tumor vascu-",

The former group of inhibitors includes angiostatin, 10 encompassing kringle 1-4 of plasminogen; endostatin, a proteolytic fragment of a collagen Type XVIII 12 ; a fragment of antithrombin 13 ; and fragments of collagen IV, including tumstatin, 14 canstatin, 15 and arresten. 16 To determine whether an additional NGR sequence could improve endothelial cell homing and biologic activity, human endostatin was modified genetically to introduce an NGR motif and was expressed in yeast. Although endostatin has an internal NGR sequence (at position 126 -128), this site is not accessible to bind and inhibit APN activity. 17 However, when an NGR sequence was added to the amino terminus of endostatin (NGR-endostatin), APN activity was inhibited significantly.

Proteolysis of the ECM can also release sequestered angiogenic molecules. It has been reported that APN mediates the migration of human metastatic cell lines through matrigel. 23 APN also plays an important role in angiogenesis. APN expression is prognostic in patients with colon carcinoma. 24 Recent studies have shown that functional antagonists of APN (bestatin, actinonin, and anti-APN antibody) can inhibit tube formation and motility in endothelial cells without altering their proliferation. 4, 24 Recombinant endostain has been cloned and expressed in different expression systems. In some model systems, endostatin treatment either inhibited or regressed experimental tumors. 12 Other studies showed only moderate inhibition. 25 Bacterial expression systems often have resulted in insoluble proteins, necessitating a refolding protocol. It has been suggested that the slow release of endostatin from the insoluble suspension, coupled with proper refolding in vivo, is responsible for the potent inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Kranenburg et al. reported that a denatured, insoluble form of endostatin showed better bioactivity than a soluble form of endostatin. 26 Kruger et al. demonstrated the different efficacy between Calbiochem-endostatin and En-treMed-endostatin. 27 Genetic expression of human endostatin in bacteria and yeast seems to affect its biologic activity. Differences in potency and solubility characteristics, which reflect in part on protein folding, may explain the differences seen in endostatin efficacy in vivo. Understanding the basis for these discrepancies will aid in the successful clinical development of endostatin.",

In the current study, we evaluated whether an NGR motif also could potentiate the activity of endostatin by virtue of binding to APN expressed on endothelial cells. We showed that an NGR motif increased endothelial cell attachment that was specific to APN expression. NGR-endostatin did not alter the basal binding of APN-negative WM35 melanoma cells. The data presented in the current study further validate the finding that the internal NGR sequence present in the native endostatin is not accessible to bind APN or to inhibit its enzymatic activity. The addition of an NGR motif to endostatin showed significant inhibition of APN activity in endothelial cell lysates. Furthermore, an NGR sequence at the amino terminus of endostatin enhanced the efficacy of endostatin to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Curnis et al. showed that similar modification of TNF did not alter its affinity or biologic activity in vitro. 6 However, an NGR motif improved the efficacy of TNF in vivo. In the current study, we observed that the addition of an NGR sequence to endostatin increased its binding to endothelial cells and enhanced its biologic activity. No improvement in the biologic activity was seen when native endostatin was admixed with NGR peptides. These results suggest that enhanced inhibition of endothelial cells is dependent on an NGR motif in association with endostatin. In previous studies, doxorubicin conjugated with NGR peptides showed less toxicity to tumor cells in vitro (72 hours) compared with unconjugated doxorubicin. 7 However, NGR-conjugated doxorubicin showed better efficacy in vitro with a short exposure (20 minutes) 28 and inhibited tumor growth in vivo better compared with unconjugated doxorubicin. 7,28 Ellerby et al. showed that the biologic activity of a proapoptotic peptide (KLAKLAK) 2 was improved both in vitro and in vivo by an NGR motif. 8 Recently, Bhagwat et al. showed that inhibition of the angiogenic signal transduction pathway can be restored by the overexpression of APN. 29 Therefore, the blockage of APN activity by an NGR motif and the antiangiogenic effect of endostatin could act synergistically.",

Pastorino et al. showed that liposome coupled with NGR had a longer circulating profile in blood and higher tumor localization compared with uncoupled liposome. 9 NGR-endostatin also localized to tumor tissues at a higher level compared with native endostatin. Increased accumulation of NGR-endostatin was correlated with greater antiangiogenic effects in vivo. Morphometric analysis revealed that NGR-endostatin treatment reduced vessel density in residual tumors. Decreased numbers of blood vessels coin-cided with increased apoptosis in tumor tissue. The results from these studies suggest that NGR modification of angiostatic molecules, such as endostatin, can be used to improve their therapeutic efficacy.",

(B) Cell attachment assay. HUVEC or WM35 cells that were prelabeled with 5-(and-6)-carboxy fluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester, were added into triplicate wells coated with either endostatin or NGR-endostatin at a concentration of 1 nmole per well. Wells coated with 0.2% gelatin were used as maximum attachment (100%). The attached cells were quantified by a fluorescence plate reader. Values represent the mean of two independent experiments. (C) The effect of endostatin and NGR-endostatin on endothelial cell proliferation: Endostatin and NGR-endostatin were used at a concentration of 2.5 g/mL. Basic fibroblast growth factor (5 ng/mL) was used to induce proliferation of endothelial cells. The proliferation was determined by 5\u0408bromo-2\u0408-deoxyuridine uptake. (D) The effect of endostatin (open bar) and NGR-endostatin (solid bar) on HUVEC migration. NGR-containing peptide (SR-1) plus endostatin (hatched bar) did not enhance the basal level of inhibition seen with endostatin alone (open bar). (E) Tumor localization: Human colon carcinoma cells (LS174T) were injected subcutaneously into female athymic nude mice. When the tumors reached a size of \u03f7 500 mm 3 (10 days after inoculation), endostatin (open bars) or NGR-endostatin (solid bars) was injected at a dose of 20 mg/kg subcutaneously. Tumor, liver, and lung tissues were resected and homogenized. Endostatin levels in the tissues and the sera were determined by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay in the soluble fraction. Endostatin levels are expressed as a relative concentration to serum levels of endostatin. Error bars indicate the standard error. Statistical significance was determined with a Student t test.
