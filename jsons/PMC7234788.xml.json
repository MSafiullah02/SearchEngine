Preparation for the pandemic throughout Latin America, in terms of hospital capacity, human resources, and testing capacity is, however, heterogeneous.7 In this scenario, there is emerging concern about the collateral effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to diagnosis and treatment in children with cancer.8 In response to this problem, the global paediatric oncology community has summarised some of the anticipated challenges.9\n",
