By April 16, 2020, we had tested nasopharyngeal swabs taken from 266 staff members (>50% of the workforce) using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and 47 (18%) were found to be positive. Of these positive cases, 31 (66%) were symptomatic and 16 (34%) were asymptomatic (figure\n). Overall, 28 (48%) staff members remained positive at 7 days after the initial test was taken, 16 (34%) at 10 days, and four (9%) at 14 days, with one health-care worker remaining positive until 26 days. Of 25 symptomatic staff members who initially tested negative and were retested, only one (4%) became positive after 7 days. Potential factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity are summarised in the figure.",

These health-care workers could, therefore, have returned to work (assuming they were not unwell) as soon as they received their result. Had these health-care workers not been tested, they would have been obliged to self-isolate for 7 days or more, and their household members for 14 days.",

Health-care workers at our hospital are regularly reminded to self-isolate when symptomatic, and their body temperature is checked daily and they are assessed with structured questionnaires when swabbed. Our finding, however, that 16 (34%) of 47 health-care workers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic, and that 45 (59%) of 76 symptomatic health-care workers tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, highlights a crucial need for the routine testing of all health-care workers, including those who do not have direct contact with patients.",

Redeployment of health-care workers has depleted some specialties and has led to staff working in unfamiliar environments. Training and research have been suspended, and annual leave has been postponed. The UK Health Secretary's promise to reach a target of 100 000 tests per day by the end of April, 2020, was achieved. Therefore, universal testing of health-care workers is feasible, potentially ameliorating the current workforce depletion and reducing the risk of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2.",
