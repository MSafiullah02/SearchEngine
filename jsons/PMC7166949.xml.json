Acute respiratory infections are also associated with high mortality in the elderly and individuals with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems. Clinical manifestations in respiratory infections range from self\u2010limited upper respiratory tract infections to more serious lower respiratory tract infections. Determining etiological diagnoses for patients with respiratory symptoms remains a clinical and laboratory challenge. Most laboratory\u2010confirmed viral infections are attributed to respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), influenza viruses A and B (IAV, IBV), human rhinoviruses (HRhV), and adenoviruses (AdV). Clinical virology laboratories have used historically traditional methods such as direct fluorescent\u2010antibody assay (DFA) for the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections, however, these methods fail to detect a large proportion of infections.",

The use of sensitive PCR techniques has obviously increased virus detection rates and not only in symptomatic but also in asymptomatic subjects, and has made the interpretation of positive test results somehow more complicated. The link of causality between virus identification and symptoms remains uncertain, especially when low copy numbers and multiple viruses are detected. Furthermore, at the time of specimen collection, the patient could be in an incubation period and not experiencing any symptoms. In addition, a subject could be asymptomatic whereas the PCR detects remnants of distant infection. For instance, HBoV and HRhV may persist several weeks in nasopharyngeal cavities in convalescent patients [Jartti et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2010].
