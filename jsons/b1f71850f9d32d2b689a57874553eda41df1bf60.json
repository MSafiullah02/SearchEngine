The inflammatory response in the severe group was more significant than that in the non-severe group. There were more patients taking anticoagulant drugs (25 [42.4%] vs. 4 [8.5%], P < 0.001) and sedative drugs (22 [37.3%] vs. 9 [19.1%], P = 0.041) in the severe group than in the non-severe group.

Clinical case studies of COVID-19 showed that elderly patients and patients with co-morbid neurological diseases had a high rate of severe and critical illness and a high rate of mortality. 2, 12, 14, 15 Most patients with neurological diseases have co-morbid underlying diseases, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and metabolic syndrome, which in turn increase their risks of contracting 2019-nCoV, converting into severe illness, and dying. 13, 14 To the best of our knowledge, except for a few case reports, there has been no clinical analysis of patients with neurological diseases and co-morbid COVID-19. Diagnostic information of patients with COVID-19 hospitalised in Huoshenshan Hospital who had completed treatment was retrieved in this study. The clinical characteristics of 106 patients with COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases were analysed.",

Upon admission, subjective symptoms were provided by patients who had clear consciousness, normal cognition and psychology, and normal speech; if patients showed impaired consciousness, aphasia, or dementia, the subjective symptoms were provided by their immediate family members who had no problems in cognition, psychology, or speech, and the subjective symptoms were clarified by reviewing previous medical records and communicating directly with their close relatives and physicians. All included data were obtained with verbal consent from the patients or their family members. Each patient's data were collected and cross-checked by two well-trained and experienced neurologists.

This study presented an analysis of the clinical characteristics of neurological diseases co-morbid with COVID-19 in the largest sample size so far. Of the 106 patients enrolled in this study, 59 (55.7%) had severe and 47 (44.3%) had non-severe disease, and the average age was 72.7 (11.8) years. Fever was still the most common non-neurological symptom. However, the proportion of patients with fever was only 58.5%, which was significantly lower than the 85.14%-98.6% reported by other studies, 2 12 15 16 19 but similar to the proportion of 61.7% in 214 patients in a study by Mao et al. 14 Mo et al. 19 also found that the proportion of patients with fever in the refractory group was 74.1%, lower than the 90% in the moderate group, and the average age of the refractory group was 61 years, significantly higher than the 46 years of the moderate group. The low occurrence of fever in this group was linked to an advanced average age, a decrease in pulmonary defence function, and a decline in systemic immunity. In this study, the proportions of patients with expectoration and dyspnoea in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the non-severe group, and moreover, the severe group had significantly higher neutrophil ratios and higher levels of infection indicators (CRP, hypersensitive CRP, and procalcitonin).",

Owing to co-morbid neurological diseases, most patients had different degrees of motor dysfunction, resulting in long-term bed rest and fluid accumulation in the dorsal regions of the lungs, which was more likely to cause hypostatic pneumonia and reduce pulmonary reserve. In the meantime, bulbar palsy further exacerbated the inflammation of the lungs. In addition to the fact that patients had many co-morbidities at an advanced age, the above observations could be a main reason why there was a higher mortality rate (13.6%) in patients with severe COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases than in other populations. 2 7 19 In this study, altered mental status occurred in 6 patients (5.7%), all of whom were in the severe group.

Although no patient presented with meningeal irritation and obvious inflammatory changes in the cerebrospinal fluid, the above observation was still highly indicative of meningeal involvement. This suggested that 2019-nCoV could involve the central nervous system (CNS), especially in patients who had blood-brain barrier breakdown due to a neurological disease. The pathophysiology pathways of 2019-nCoV involvement in the nervous system is still unclear. The viruses 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are all coronaviruses, and they have highly homologous sequences. Most coronaviruses have similar viral structures and transmission routes. 21 A previous study revealed that SARS-CoV could invade the mouse brain tissue through olfactory epithelial cells in the nasal cavity, resulting in neuronal death. 22 Autopsy results also revealed that SARS-CoV existed in the CNS. 22 With the in-depth understanding of COVID-19, it has been reported that patients with COVID-19 could experience olfactory and taste impairment. 10 Therefore, 2019-nCoV invasion of the brain tissue through the lamina cribrosa close to the olfactory bulb may be a pathway of CNS infection. 23 Olfactory and taste impairment was not observed in the 106 participants in the present study, suggesting that the above-mentioned pathway may not be the main pathway for the virus invasion of the CNS. Another possible reason for the lack of olfactory and taste impairment may be that there were few frontline neurologists and thus such symptoms were likely to be omitted.",

This result was similar to that of Mao et al., 14 but it still remains to be verified by conducting autopsies to find corresponding evidence in skeletal muscles. Meanwhile, it cannot be ruled out that infection may cause an excessive immune response, damaging the nervous system, and an increase in the level of cytokines may damage skeletal muscles. 24 Recent reports have shown that 2019-nCoV infection may cause a cytokine storm, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction, including cellular immunity deficiencies, coagulation activation, myocardial injury, liver injury, and kidney injury. 11, 14, 15 In the present study, the severe group had a decrease in red blood cells, lymphocytes, and monocytes as well as an increase in interleukin-6 levels, prothrombin time, and D-dimer levels. This suggested that the patients with severe disease were more likely to develop a cytokine storm, which caused coagulation activation and an increase in red blood cell destruction. The elevated D-dimer levels also increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. 26 Although the proportion of patients taking anticoagulant drugs in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group, the proportion of patients on prophylactic medications (anti-platelets and statins) for secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease was very low in the 106 patients, which may be a reason for the high incidence of acute cerebrovascular disease (9.4%) and high mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases in this study. The proportion of patients taking sedative drugs was high in the severe group, mainly because patients needed to be sedated when undergoing mechanical ventilation. After these data were excluded, there was no significant difference between the two groups. However, it should be noted that patients with neurological diseases may develop central respiratory depression, which is also a cause of increasing mortality. 20, 23 Limitations This study had several limitations. First, it was a retrospective study, with a sample size of only 106 cases, which may lead to a bias in clinical observation. Second, given that some patients had dementia, aphasia, and impaired consciousness, it was inevitable that some information failed to be collected. In an infectious disease hospital, the collection of neurological symptoms may be inaccurate and incomplete, and when extracting data from electronic medical records, clinical symptoms may be underestimated.

Regarding neurological symptoms, altered mental state was more common in patients with severe COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases. For patients with neurological diseases who have no typical respiratory symptoms, it is necessary to pay attention to neurological symptoms and the physical examination, improve nucleic acid testing for virus in a timely manner, and perform pulmonary imaging studies, which would be beneficial in the early detection of COVID-19 and avoidance of infection. Moreover, attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment of primary neurological diseases, which would help to reduce the mortality of such patients.",
