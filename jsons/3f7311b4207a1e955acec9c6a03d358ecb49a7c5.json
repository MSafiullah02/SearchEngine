Fractionation technologies cannot be used to treat cellular blood components. Although blood donor screening, deferral and disease testing have drastically reduced the incidence of transfusion-transmitted diseases, the threat of new or re-emerging pathogens remains. Of particular concern is the silent emergence of a new agent with a prolonged latent period in which asymptomatic infected carriers would donate and spread infection. The ultimate goal of pathogen-inactivation is to reduce transmission of potential pathogens without significantly compromising the therapeutic efficacy of the cellular and protein constituents of blood. The acceptable technology must not introduce toxicities into the blood supply nor result in neoantigen formation and subsequent antibody production. Several promising pathogeninactivation technologies are being developed and tested, and others are currently in use, but all of them have limits.

Inactivation technologies promise an additional layer of protection both from infectious agents that are known as well as from those not yet recognized as threats to the blood supply (Table 1) . A method with broad antimicrobial activity could eliminate emerging agents before they become recognized as transfusion-transmitted pathogens.

As pathogen-reduction occurrs after different steps of precipitation and filtration in the fractionation process, proteins isolated later in the schematic were generally safer from infectious agents [9] . The albumin and globulin fractions proved extremely safe, particularly regarding transmission of hepatitis viruses and HIV. However, the process was not infallible and deviations from proper processing have resulted in disease transmission. Some of the most important plasma protein derivatives such as factors VIII and IX are separated early in the fractionation process and do not reap the benefits of added layers of fractionation and processing. Pasteurization has been used effectively to inactivate viruses in albumin fractions stabilized with small chain fatty acids from as early as 1948 [10] . Other proteins, especially clotting factors, denature during the pasteurization process unless additional stabilizers are added. Terminal heat inactivation of lyophilized clotting factors has brought varied results depending upon temperature and processing time. Dry heat treatment of lyophilized clotting factors at 60-68 \u00b0 C does not prevent transmission of HBV, HCV and HIV. Increasing the dry heat temperature to 80 \u00b0 C for 72 h destroys HIV, HBV and HCV, although the non-enveloped viruses, especially HAV and human Parvo B19, may not be completely inactivated. Adding humidity (vapor heating) improves viral kill. Heat inactivation at 100 \u00b0 C for as little as 1 h has resulted in viral inactivation of both lipid enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. When this process is applied to intravenous immunoglobulin concentrates, little protein is lost.

The tri-n-butyl phosphate is removed by oil extraction, and Triton-X-100 is removed by chromatographic adsorption. Plasma protein concentrates have been made from solvent-detergent-treated plasma, and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) equivalent has been licensed in the USA and Europe. As with the heat-inactivated coagulation factors, solvent-detergent technology does not inactivate the nonenveloped viruses. Solvent-detergent treatment also results in some loss of integral plasma proteins such as \u03b1 -2 antiplasmin and protein S [12, 13] . Alpha-2 antiplasmin is crucial in maintaining haemostasis especially in patients with liver dysfunction. Decreased levels of the natural anticoagulant protein S can lead to a hypercoaguable state especially when massive solvent-detergent plasma transfusions are used as in massive traumas or therapeutic plasma exchanges. These concerns, along with economic factors, resulted in the removal of solvent-detergent plasma from the US market. Solvent-detergent plasma is still used widely in Europe. Recently, two new solvent-detergent treatment procedures have been developed for single unit or mini-pools of 10-12 units of plasma that yield > 90% mean recovery of coagulation factors, anticoagulants (including Protein S), protease inhibitors (including \u03b1 -2 antiplasmin), total protein, albumin and immunoglobulins.

Intracellular viruses are not inactivated by MB/ultraviolet light, but freezing and thawing plasma often disrupts the cell membranes of leucocytes, thus liberating the viral particles and leaving them susceptible to MB pathogen-inactivation. Residual intact white blood cells containing viruses are removed by a micropore filter. Neither protozoa nor bacteria are inactivated by MB treatment. Plasma proteins are moderately affected; fibrinogen and FVIII activity is reduced by up to 30% [17] . MB treatment can be used for pathogen-inactivation of single units of plasma, thus eliminating the risk of large plasma pools currently used to manufacture solventdetergent plasma.
