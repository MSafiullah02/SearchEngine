CoV is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted via animal-to-human and human-to-human interactions [2]. Multiple epidemic outbreaks occurred in 2002 (SARS), with approximately 800 deaths, and in 2012 (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV), with 860 deaths [2,3]. About 8 years after the MERS-CoV epidemic, the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, has emerged as a global outbreak and significant public health issue [4]. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern [5]. Astonishingly, during the first week of March, a devastating number of new cases were reported globally, and COVID-19 emerged as a pandemic. As of March 12, 2020, more than 125,000 confirmed cases across 118 countries and over 4600 deaths had been reported [6].",

To date, no antiviral treatment or vaccine has been explicitly recommended for COVID-19. Therefore, applying preventive measures to control COVID-19 infection is the most critical intervention. Health care workers (HCWs) are the primary sector in contact with patients and are an important source of exposure to infected cases in health care settings; thus, HCWs are expected to be at high risk of infection. By the end of January, the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had published recommendations for the prevention and control of COVID-19 for HCWs [8,9]. The WHO also initiated several online training sessions and materials on COVID-19 in various languages to strengthen preventive strategies, including raising awareness and training HCWs in preparedness activities [10]. In several instances, misunderstandings among HCWs have delayed controlling efforts to provide necessary treatment [11], led to the rapid spread of infection in hospitals [12,13], and put patients' lives at risk.",

In addition, the materials used for developing the survey questionnaire were also provided for any further clarifications. Moreover, to assess readability, 10 randomly selected faculty members read the questionnaire for 15 minutes and rated the ease of readability of the questionnaire ranging from 0 to 100 (0-30: confusing; 31-50: difficult; 51-70: standard; 70-90: easy; and 90-100 very easy).

Currently, there is a vast diversity of information available through the internet, including unverified malicious information, that can spread quickly and misguide HCWs. In particular, health authorities and scientists have warned that widespread misinformation about COVID-19 is a serious concern causing xenophobia worldwide [4,20-22]. In this regard, HCWs should carefully evaluate COVID-19-related information and should use scientific and authentic content as information sources.",

Additionally, many allied health workers had inaccurate knowledge of COVID-19 (eg, can be treated with antivirals and that there is a vaccine available). This is unfortunate because the surge of COVID-19 is globally devastating, and a large number of resources are provided by health care authorities to educate HCWs and improve their knowledge of COVID-19. One possible explanation for these differences in knowledge is that doctors are more educated in infectious diseases and pharmacotherapy because of their continuous professional development. Therefore, our findings suggest that greater encouragement from health authorities is needed to distribute COVID-19-related knowledge to all categories of HCWs.",

If these responses are truly representative of HCWs, this could have adverse consequences on patient care and also on the dynamics of potential COVID-19 outbreaks. This apparent lack of knowledge could result in delays in the implementation of necessary confinement measures and personal protective equipment, which may increase the burden of COVID-19. In our study, more than a quarter of the medical students thought that eating meat during the outbreak was unsafe. This may be due to the fact that COVID-19 was closely linked to a wet market in China and other viral diseases such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola emerged from zoonotic origins [23-25]. Thus, people often believe that the consumption of undercooked meat may enhance viral transmission. However, further investigation is still required. Approximately 20% (n=36) of allied health workers believed that the flu vaccine is sufficient for COVID-19 prevention. Finally, a vast majority of HCWs strongly agreed that maintaining hygiene activities, reporting recent travel history when individuals are sick, and cleaning the equipment used in wet markets are strongly recommended.",
