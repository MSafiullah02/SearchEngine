Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) offers a dramatic example: by rapidly determining the maximum incubation period of SARS, public-health officials were able to set quarantine periods and halt a potential pandemic without the aid of a vaccine or treatment.6, 7, 8, 9 The incubation period thus plays an essential part in surveillance for healthcare-associated infections,10, 11 and may aid in diagnosis if laboratory facilities are unavailable. The incubation period is clinically relevant in the administration of antiviral medications, many of which are most effective when given before or immediately after symptom onset.12 Epidemiological studies depend on the incubation period to identify potential sources of infection.13 Predictive models designed to inform policy decisions use the incubation period to evaluate the potential of surveillance programmes and interventions to confront emerging epidemics.14, 15 The length of the incubation period by comparison with the latent period (the time between infection and becoming infectious) determines the potential effectiveness of control measures that target symptomatic individuals.16\n",

Estimates of the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles were calculated, and CIs were obtained by use of the delta method.24 For one virus (human coronavirus), standard methods for maximum likelihood estimation did not converge, and an estimate obtained by use of Bayesian methods is reported. To account for the potential effect of differences between studies, hierarchical models allowing for study-specific medians were fit to the data. In most cases, these models produced estimates nearly identical to the pooled estimates (results not shown). Technical details are available in the webappendix. All analysis was done using the R statistical package (version 2\u00b76). Specific estimates found in this review, all data used in pooled analyses, and a full bibliography (including excluded abstracts and study classification) are available from the authors on request.",

The earliest data comes from 1891,71 and the most recent from 2006.72 Most sourced estimates derive from a 1979 observational study by Moser and colleagues,42 in which 37 airline passengers developed influenza after exposure to a single case. All became symptomatic 12\u201384 h after exposure (median 38 h). In a highly cited 1998 paper, Cox and Fukuda73 summarised these results, codifying the estimate as 1\u20134 days, with which most estimates for influenza are consistent (table 1). Many original studies of influenza's incubation period remain uncited. Several pre-1918 reports, a series of papers on the 1918 pandemic, and a flurry of experimental studies published in the 1930s and 1940s after discovery of the virus remain underused.",

Experimental infection and natural experiments (eg, aeroplane infections)42 may differ from normal exposure in ways that affect the incubation period. Routes of administration, changes in infectious dose, or differing periods of exposure to infectious individuals may modify the time to symptom onset. Most experimental studies use healthy adult volunteers, yet severe disease is concentrated in children and the elderly.

We found eight instances (excluding SARS, for which there is ample evidence) in which a study that might contain data on the incubation period was done but the information necessary to estimate the incubation period was not published. These studies were mostly done over 30 years ago, and we felt it unlikely that the original data could be easily obtained.
