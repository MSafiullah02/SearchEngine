Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the ratio and expression of CD4 and CD8 markers in COVID-19 patients to clarify the immune characterizations of CD4 and CD8 T-cells in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Peripheral blood samples of 25 COVID-19 patients and 25 normal individuals with similar age and sex as the control group were collected. White blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes were counted and CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results: The number of white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets were reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients (P < 0.05). The difference in CD4:CD8 ratio, CD4 T-cell frequency, CD8 T-cell frequency, and CD4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was not significant between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals (P > 0.05); however, the CD8 MFI increased significantly in COVID-19 infected patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Although, there is no significant difference in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 between two groups, the expression level of CD8 in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the normal individuals. This result suggested that the cellular immune responses triggered by COVID-19 infection were developed through overexpression of CD8 and hyperactivation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

Since, CD8 molecule is important for T-cell activity, T lymphocytes try to increase their cytotoxic activity by increasing CD8 protein [23] . However, some viral diseases, such as AIDS, have associated with a decrease in CD8 molecule, which the difference could be due to the short duration of COVID-19 infection compared with the long duration of chronic infection of AIDS [23] . The findings of this study shed light on changes in immunologic markers in COVID-19 patients. Conducting such studies in larger populations and on other immunologic markers may open the way for diagnosing and treating this disease.",
