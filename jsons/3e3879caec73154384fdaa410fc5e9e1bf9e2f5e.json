            "text": "In many patients with haematological malignancies, particularly those undergoing HSCT, there is a risk of progression to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Full clinical history and examination are essential in making the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract disease and a chest X-Ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan may be helpful to confirm or exclude the presence of lower respiratory tract disease. The definitions of upper and lower respiratory tract infection differ between reports, but, for the purposes of these guidelines they have been defined as follows, based on the European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL) recommendations (Hirsch et al, 2013 gles, sputum samples, tracheal aspirates or broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples. While collection of nasal and throat swabs or saline throat gargles can be as effective in diagnosing primary viral infections in children when using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Blaschke et al, 2011; Tunsjo et al, 2015) and direct immunofluorescent antigen detection (Del et al, 2014) , lower sensitivities (Ohrmalm et al, 2010) have been reported in non-primary and mild infections in immunocompromised patients, suggesting that a nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasal wash should be considered, where possible; it is likely that aspirates or washes provide a more consistent specimen. In patients with symptoms or signs of LRTI, a specimen should be obtained from the lower respiratory tract where possible. This sample might be obtained by induced sputum, tracheal aspirates or BAL sampling. Samples obtained by BAL should also be tested for co-pathogens (Joos et al, 2007) . Viral culture and immunofluorescence testing have been used in the past for diagnosis of respiratory viruses in this population but have now been superseded by molecular diagnostics. It is currently recommended that the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections is made by quantitative nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), generically referred to hereafter as PCR; clinicians should be able to liaise with their virology laboratory colleagues regarding the interpretation of PCR results (reviewed in Hirsch et al, 2013) . A panel of viruses should be included for PCR testing, including parainfluenza type 4. Developments in molecular testing may allow for rapid, point of care testing in the future, which would be optimal for this patient population.

It is suggested that these websites are reviewed directly to ensure that guidance is up to date (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/seasonal-influenza-guidance-data-and-analysis; last accessed 1 November 2015). The recommendations provided by Health Protection Scotland are based on these recommendations (http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/resp/seasonalinfluenza.aspx; last accessed 1 November 2015) and Public Health Wales also follows similar recommendations (http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/888/page/43745; last accessed 5 July 2015). The current recommendations are 75 mg oseltamivir orally for 10 d once daily if the dominant influenza strain is of lower risk for oseltamivir resistance (e.g. A(H3N2). The recommendations provide lower doses for children <13 years of age. Ideally, therapy should be started within 48 h of exposure on the advice of a specialist. Inhaled Zanamivir (10 mg for 10 d once daily for adults and children \u22655 years of age; it is not licensed for children <5 years) is an alternative if the dominant influenza strain is likely to be resistant to oseltamivir e.g. A(H1N1)pdm2009. Ideally, therapy should be started within 36 h of last contact. The use of zanamivir relies on the ability of the adult or child to effectively use the inhaler. Intravenous or nebulized zanamivir is unlicensed but available for compassionate use on a named patient basis. Healthcare workers with URTI or LRTI symptoms should avoid contact with susceptible patients where possible. It is appreciated that this might not always be practical (Hirsch et al, 2013) .",

The current guidance recommends oseltamivir orally (75 mg twice daily for 5 d for patients \u226513 years of age, doses are provided for younger children in the guidance) as first line treatment where there is a low risk of oseltamivir resistant strains and zanamivir inhaler (Diskhaler) when the dominant strain has a higher risk of resistance e.g. influenza A (H1N1). Treatment should ideally be commenced within 48 h of symptom onset in patients with uncomplicated influenza. In patients with complicated influenza, defined as requiring hospital admission and/or signs of LRTI, central nervous system involvement or exacerbation of underlying medical condition, treatment should be administered regardless of the timing of onset of symptoms. Five days is the minimum duration of treatment and may be continued for longer, depending on response. Second line treatment is indicated in patients with poor gastrointestinal absorption or poor clinical response to first line treatment and inhaled zanamivir (10 mg twice daily for 5 d for adults and children \u22655 years of age) is recommended. Treatment with intravenous or nebulized zanamivir may also be considered in patients who are not able to use inhaled zanamivir effectively. The use of these preparations of zanamivir is unlicensed and they are available on a compassionate use basis for named patients in the UK. Patients should receive treatment when they have either upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms. In patients with suspected complicated influenza, treatment should be commenced on clinical suspicion without waiting for laboratory confirmation. Similarly, in the event of an increase in influenza cases in the community, patients with uncomplicated infection should also be treated at the first sign of symptoms. The most common toxicity of oseltamivir is nausea and vomiting and there have been rare reports of more severe adverse events including anaphylaxis and hepatic dysfunction (https:// www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/10446; last accessed 21 June 2015, Dobson et al, 2000) .

At the time of writing access to aerosolized ribavirin in the UK is limited as the licensed product is no longer available. An alternative aerosolized product is manufactured by Valeant pharmaceuticals (Quebec, Canada); it may be available to centres in the UK but it is unlicensed and would need to be imported. Toxicities associated with the administration of aerosolized ribavirin include bronchospasm, cough, claustrophobia, nausea, rash, reduced pulmonary function, mucus plugging and conjunctival irritation (Shah & Chemaly, 2011) . There is a potential risk that ribavirin is teratogenic and mutagenic so patients and staff should be made aware of the risks. These are documented in full in the summary of product characteristics (https:// www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/866; last accessed 05 April 2015).

The available data on the efficacy of aerosolized ribavirin is largely limited to single centre studies. Boeckh et al (2007) reported a randomized controlled trial of aerosolized ribavirin at a dose of 2 g, 3 times daily compared to supportive care in post-HSCT patients with upper respiratory tract RSV infection. Only 14 patients (including 2 children) were included due to slow accrual over a 5-year period. The end point was development of clinical pneumonia, which occurred in 1/9 (11\u00c11%) of ribavirin recipients and 2/5 (40%) of control patients. All patients were alive after 28 d of follow-up (Boeckh et al, 2007) .",

This retrospective study reviewed the outcome of all patients who had laboratory-confirmed RSV infections from January 1996 to May 2009. Patients were treated with aerosolized ribavirin and/or IVIG at the discretion of the treating physician. The same group has subsequently published an Immunodeficiency Scoring Index based on the data from the 237 patients in the study who presented with URTI symptoms (Shah et al, 2014) . Patients were stratified into low, medium and high-risk groups based on a scoring system (see Table IV ). Patients who scored 0-2 were classified as lowrisk, those who scored 3-6 were classified as moderate risk and those who scored 7-12 were classified as high-risk (Shah et al, 2014) . High-risk patients were significantly more at risk of LRTI and mortality than moderate or low-risk patients (P < 0\u00c1001). Patients in the high-risk group also had the greatest benefit from ribavirin administered at the URTI stage. This scoring system has not yet been validated in a prospective cohort of patients.",

RSV specific immunoglobulin (RespiGam) was withdrawn by the manufacturers in March 2004 and is no longer available for use. Palivizumab is a humanized anti-RSV monoclonal antibody that has been used in animal models (Ottolini et al, 2002) and was found to be safe for use in HSCT recipients in a small phase 1 study . A larger series of 40 adults and children treated with palivizumab following HSCT showed no evidence of improved survival or prevention of progression to LRTI (de Fontbrune et al, 2007) . Although no randomized data exist in the stem cell transplant population, there are randomized data supporting the use of palivizumab prophylaxis in selected high-risk children (The Impact-RSV study Group, 1998) . Palivizumab is only licensed for this indication and not for treatment of RSV in patients with haematological malignancies or post-HSCT. Palivizumab is not recommended for the treatment of adults with RSV infection but may be considered in children. Shah and Chemaly (2011) reviewed thirteen studies that included 407 post-HSCT adults treated with aerosolized ribavirin plus either IVIG, Palivizumab or RSV-specific IVIG. Similarly, the risk of progression to LRTI was lower in those treated at the URTI stage (12% compared to 45%). There was a trend towards a lower rate of progression to LRTI in recipients of dual therapy than in those patients that received aerosolized ribavirin alone (12% compared to 25%, P = 0\u00c113). The RSV-specific mortality rate in patients with LRTI was significantly lower in the combination group (24% Table IV .

It is recommended that patients who have undergone allogeneic transplantation and have risk factors for progression to LRTI with RSV should receive therapy with aerosolized ribavirin and IVIG. If aerosolized ribavirin is not available, oral ribavirin may be an alternative. The authors note that IVIG may not be available for use in all patients due to demand management guidelines in the United Kingdom (http:// www.ivig.nhs.uk/documents/dh_129666.pdf; last accessed 12 December 2015) An algorithm for treatment is outlined in Fig 1. Oral ribavirin. In view of the recent lack of availability of aerosolized ribavirin, there has been considerable interest in the use of oral ribavirin in RSV infection in HSCT recipients. Oral ribavirin is not licensed for the treatment of respiratory viruses but has been used in several reports. Khanna et al (2008) reported a retrospective review of 34 adult patients with RSV (22 with URTI and 12 with LRTI). Twenty-four patients (71%) had undergone allogeneic HSCT. Twenty-five patients received treatment with oral ribavirin with IVIG or oral ribavirin plus palivizumab (14 for URTI, 11 for LRTI). Oral ribavirin was administered at a loading dose of 10 mg/ kg, which was then increased to 400 mg three times daily on day 2, and 600 mg three times daily on day 3. Four patients required mechanical ventilation and received IV ribavirin using the same dosing regimen. RSV-attributable mortality was 18% (6/34). Five patients developed haemolysis (Khanna et al, 2008) . A more recent study used oral ribavirin in 13 adult patients with RSV infection post-HSCT (Casey et al, 2013) . Seven patients had URTI and 6 had LRTI. Patients received oral ribavirin at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d in four divided doses, which was escalated dependent on clinical response to a total dose of 60 mg/kg/d along with IVIG. Three patients (3/13, 23%) died of RSV-related respiratory infection. All seven patients with URTI progressed to LRTI at the starting dose of 10 mg/kg/d but six subsequently responded at higher doses. The median duration of therapy was 25\u00c15 d (range 10-33 d). No patients developed haemolysis. Marcelin et al (2014) also recently reported on the use of oral ribavirin in a heterogeneous patient group of 34 patients including some HSCT recipients. No patients died of RSV infection but one developed haemolytic anaemia and lactic acidosis and another developed altered mental status (Marcelin et al, 2014) . Although evidence is limited, oral ribavirin appears to be safe and cost-effective for the treatment of URTI in HSCT recipients. A starting dose higher than 10 mg/kg/d, e.g 15-20 mg/kg/d, may be more effective (Casey et al, 2013) .",

URTI should not be treated as there is no evidence this reduces risk of LRTI. Occurrences of LRTI should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and the Immunodeficiency Scoring Index (Shah et al, 2014 ) may be useful here. However, it must be appreciated that LRTI HMPV in adults, when compared to RSV and influenza, is associated with similar complication rates, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospitalization and length of stay in the ICU Jain et al, 2014) . The high prevalence of previous infection in the population means that relatively high titres of HMPV neutralizing antibodies are found in pooled IVIG. In vitro studies have shown similar efficacy of IVIG against RSV and HMPV (Wyde et al, 2003) . IVIG at a dose of 0\u00c14 g/kg weekly has been used in several case studies and small series to treat patients with HMPV (Shachor-Meyouhas et al, 2012; Kitanovski et al, 2013) .",

In addition to being a small retrospective series, the study populations were imbalanced with only half of the HMPV patients receiving IVIG or ribavirin or both.

While these are unlikely to be directly applicable to immunosuppressed patients they may prove useful in the context of vaccination of household contacts (Rubin et al, 2014) . Reduction in risk of initial viral infection of the immunosuppressed may reduce the risk of secondary bacteria or fungal infection (Alymova et al, 2005; Bosch et al, 2013) .",

The capsid-binding agent Pleconaril has been studied in picornavirus-infected patients but not specifically in the setting of HSCT. Limited effects on reduction of symptom duration were observed with this drug and, ultimately, acquired viral resistance was detected (Hayden et al, 2003; Pevear et al, 2005) . Another capsid-binding drug, BTA-798, is under evaluation in a Phase II study enrolling asthma-sufferers (NCT01175226). Inhaled interferon-b 1a (SNG001) is similarly being investigated in asthmatics (NCT01126177). Neither of these agents has as yet been tested in HSCT recipients. Vaccination against HRV remains a challenging prospect, due mainly to the presence of >100 HRV serotypes. It is recommended that supportive care only should be used in the management of HRV infection due to insufficient evidence to support specific therapies. A recent study confirmed increased post-HSCT mortality in patients with HRV infection pre-transplant, underlying the need for research and better intervention for HRV infections (Campbell et al, 2015) .",
