This came across as a surprise considering that genomes of the other organisms (from yeast to Caenorhabditis elegans) are quite dense. Is the rest of the human genome merely \u201cjunk\u201d DNA? This question was partially answered by experimental approaches like high-throughput sequencing or whole genome high density tailing arrays. Now it is known that this \u201cjunk\u201d DNA is transcribed throughout mammalian genomes and because it lacks protein coding capacity it is referred to as long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) [2\u20137].",

Initially they were thought to be coding RNAs, however, deeper analyses revealed a lack of open reading frames (ORF). Furthermore they were thought to be random in nature more so than stable elements in genome. This opinion changed when FANTOM consortium analyzed over 60,000 full length cDNAs and identified over 11,000 lncRNAs in mouse [9]. Interestingly, a large portion of identified lncRNAs is transcribed in antisense orientation to protein-coding genes, thus are referred to as natural antisense transcripts (NATs). Another study extended these findings by identifying NATs in human genome [10]. Interestingly many cancer associated genes, particularly tumor suppressor genes have long antisense ncRNA.",

The fact that they are not evolutionary conserved, even between related species could indicate that most of them are non functional and may represent just transcriptional noise. To date, only 200 lncRNAs have been studied functionally with variable outcome, although many of them show at least functional evidence in vitro. Only a few lncRNAs have been studied in animal models, suggesting that they are not essential for viability. For example, mouse homologue of HOTAIR is poorly conserved in sequence and its deletion, along with the deletion of the HoxC cluster, has only a little effect in vivo, neither on the expression pattern or transcription efficiency, nor on the amount of K27me3 coverage of different Hoxd target genes [14]. On the other hand it is possible that the lack of one particular lncRNA can substituted by another one.",

The sizes and features of NATs can be variable. They can be classified based on their transcriptional start site, splicing, capping and polyadenylation. With respect to transcriptional start sites, NATs can be divided into three types: (1) overlapping, (2) intronic and (3) intergenic [25, 26]. Sequence of overlapping NATs partly overlaps with sense mRNA sequence with preference for the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR). Due to sequence complementarity, these regions can mutually interact by complete or partial hybridization. Thus NATs may function to regulate the expression of the overlapping sense mRNA [27\u201329].",

These lincRNAs have been implicated in diverse biological processes, including cell-cycle regulation, immune surveillance, and embryonic stem cell pluripotency. However, the mechanism by which these lincRNAs function remains elusive. To date, there are approximately 3300 of human lincRNAs identified by analyzing chromatin-state maps in various human cell types. It is known that one of the well-characterized lincRNA HOTAIR binds the polycomb repressive complex (PRC2). Remarkably, approximately 20 % of lincRNAs expressed in various cell types are bound by PRC2. Other lincRNA interact with different chromatin-modifying complexes. Furthermore depletion of certain lincRNAs associated with PRC2 leads to changes in gene express\nion, causing the up-regulation of genes that are normally silenced by PRC2. Therefore it is suggested that some lincRNAs guide chromatin-modifying complexes to specific genomic loci to regulate gene expression [2, 5].",

Such a bi-directional transcription results in so called cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) in budding yeast [30\u201332]. CUTs are Pol II-dependent transcripts produced from promoters in opposite direction to the coding gene, which are degraded by the nuclear exosome shortly after their synthesis. Another type of transcript derived from promoter regions are stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs), which are not processed by exosome [32]. Bidirectional transcription is not only limited to yeast species, but extends to higher eukaryotes too. Studies using exosome depletion in human fibroblasts have revealed lncRNAs, which correspond to upstream regions of protein coding genes. Such promoter-upstream transcripts are referred to as PROMPTs [33]. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis from mouse embryonic stem cells has shown many promoter associated transcripts, which are transcribed in non-random, divergent orientation [34]. Another sequencing approach employed global run on sequencing (GRO-seq) to indentify nascent RNAs in human fibroblasts. This study revealed that almost 80 % of the active promoters display bidirectional transcriptional activity [35]. It is now known that bidirectional transcription is a widespread phenomenon, which is conserved across species. There are suggestions that this bidirectional transcription may be a type of gene express\nion\nregulation that promotes an open chromatin structure at promoters by recruiting positive or negative transcriptional regulators.",

Enhancer associated transcripts were identified as lncRNAs (termed eRNAs) produced in both directions and their expression does correlate with mRNA synthesis from nearby gene [36]. There is a possibility that eRNAs may be directly involved in enhancer function. eRNAs may facilitate recruitment of enhancer-associated proteins or enhance chromatin looping to provide contact between the enhancer and the promoter of a particular regulated gene [37].",

However, this is not the case for all sense and intronic lncRNAs since the expression patterns of some of these transcripts are not the same as their associated protein-coding gene [41]. Another hypothesis suggests that some lncRNA sequences are precursors to short miRNAs. An example of this is the lncRNA H19 which encodes the miRNA miR-675 [4].

It is accepted that Xist is associated as an RNA compartment with the inactivated X chromosome [47]. The coating the chromatin that is silenced provides the first model for how lncRNA might function in stable epigenetic gene silencing in cis. Xist establishes a specialized, Pol II free, region, into which most of the X chromosome becomes localized during inactivation [48].

Full-length Xist, produced from the X chromosome, destined to be inactivated, also binds to PRC2 and leads to the spreading of X inactivation from the center to the entire X chromosome in cis. Active chromatin status of the other X chromosome is protected by Tsix, which blocks transcription of Xist. It is not well understood, what prevents Xist from escaping the inactive X chromosome and acting on the active X chromosome in trans or how 20 % of X chromosome genes escape inactivation in human females [51, 52].

One such lncRNA involved in genomic imprinting in cis is Air, which is mono-allelically expressed from the paternal allele.

One such an example is a lncRNA that is transcribed from a minor promoter upstream of the human dihudrofolate reductase DHFR gene. Transcription of this full length lncRNA is thought to repress transcription from the major DHFR promoter [67] in an RNA dependent manner. The lncRNA binds to the major DHFR promoter and the general transcription factor IIB and leads to dissociation of the pre-initiation complex. It is proposed that the single-stranded lncRNA hybridizes to double-stranded DNA in the promoter region to form a triplex structure. Such a structure is predicted to be most concentrated around human promoters [68], but it is unclear whether this is a common mechanism for lncRNA transcriptional repression.",

Zeb2 NAT is expressed upon EMT and masks the splice site, so blocking splicesome function.

Re-sequencing approaches helped to identify a 13 kb long intron-less lncRNA, termed PRNCR1 (prostate cancer non-coding RNA1) [91]. Depletion of PRNCR1 attenuated the viability of PC cells and the trans-activation activity of the androgen receptor. Therefore, it has been proposed that PRNCR1 is involved in prostate carcinogenesis through androgen receptor activity. These findings provide a novel insight into understanding the pathogenesis of genetic factors for prostate cancer.",

De-regulation of HOTAIR represses the expression of a subset of cell-to-cell interaction promoting genes, including JAM2, PCDH10, PCDHB5 and EPHA1. Furthermore, the interaction of HOTAIR and PRC2, which leads to increased H3K27 trimethylation and silencing of metastasis suppressor genes, is responsible for HOTAIR mediated tumor cell invasion and subsequent metastasis. Additionally, increased levels of HOTAIR were detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that HOTAIR could be a candidate biomarker for tumor recurrence prediction. Depletion of HOTAIR in liver cancer cells results in reduced cell viability and sensitized apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha [92]. These studies indicate that lincRNAs have active roles in modulating the cancer epigenome and could be an important predictor for cancer outcome as well as novel targets for cancer therapy.",

Loss of Kcnq1ot1 imprinting is accompanied by loss of methylation of the control element, a CpG-island called KvDMR1. KvDMR1 contains the promoter for the paternally expressed Kcnq1ot1. Disruption of this promoter abolishes Kcnq1ot1 transcripts leading to activation of neighboring genes such as tumor repressor CDKN1C [98].

Ectopic expression of MEG3 up-regulates p53 protein levels and dramatically induces p53 transcription. Furthermore, MEG3 selectively enhances p53 binding to its target promoter, such as GDF15. Expression of MEG3 is able to inhibit cell proliferation in the absence of p53.

Combining half-lives with comprehensive lncRNA annotations hundreds of unstable (half-life < 2 h) intergenic, cis-antisense, and intronic lncRNAs, as well as lncRNAs showing extreme stability (half-life > 16 h) were identified.

To date, lncRNAs have been shown to be involved in many different stages of gene expression regulation. This diversity in function suggests that lncRNAs will ultimately be found to participate at all levels of transcriptional control, from nuclear localization of transcription factors to transcriptional termination. Several lncRNAs have been implicated in the mediation of chromatin structure. Enabling the accessibility of the genome to Pol II and its associated factors is the most efficient way to activate or repress transcription.
