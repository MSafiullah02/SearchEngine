Traditionally, evolutionary biology has therefore been a field dominated by observation and theory, even though some regard the domestication of plants and animals as early, unwitting evolution experiments. Realistically, we can carry out controlled evolution experiments only with organisms that have very short generation times, so that populations can undergo hundreds of generations within a time frame of months or years. With the advances in microbiology, such experiments in evolution have become feasible with bacteria and viruses [18, 49] . However, even with microorganisms, evolution experiments still take a lot of time to complete and are often cumbersome. In particular, some data can be difficult or impossible to obtain, and it is often impractical to carry out enough replicas for high statistical accuracy.",

It seems to be an obvious idea to set up these conditions in a computer and to study evolution in silico rather than in vitro. In a computer, it is easy to measure any quantity of interest with arbitrary precision, and the time it takes to propagate organisms for several hundred generations is only limited by the processing power available. In fact, population geneticists have long been carrying out computer simulations of evolving loci, in order to test or augment their mathematical theories (see [21, 22, 28, 35, 40] for some examples). However, the assumptions put into these simulations typically mirror exactly the assumptions of the analytical calculations. Therefore, the simulations can be used only to test whether the analytic calculations are error-free or whether stochastic effects cause a system to deviate from its deterministic description, but they cannot test the model assumptions on a more basic level.",

            "text": "An approach to studying evolution that lies somewhere in between evolution experiments with biochemical organisms and standard Monte Carlo simulations is the study of self-replicating and evolving computer programs (digital organisms). These digital organisms can be quite complex and interact in a multitude of different ways with their environment or each other, so that their study is not a simulation of a particular evolutionary theory but becomes an experimental study in its own right. In recent years, research with digital organisms has grown substantially ( [5, 9, 17, 19, 24, 29, 53, 55, 56, 57] , see [3, 51] for reviews) and is being increasingly accepted by evolutionary biologists [39] . (However, as Barton and Zuidema [6] note, general acceptance will ultimately hinge on whether artificial life researchers embrace or ignore the large body of population-genetics literature.) Avida is arguably the most advanced software platform to study digital organisms to date and is certainly the one that has had the biggest impact in the biological literature so far. Having reached version 2.8, it now supports detailed control over experimental settings, a sophisticated system to design and execute experimental protocols, a multitude of possibilities for organisms to interact with their environment (including depletable resources and conversion from one resource into another), and a module to post-process data from evolution experiments (including tools to find the line of descent from the original ancestor to any final organism, to carry out knock-out studies with organisms, to calculate the fitness landscape around a genotype and to align and compare organisms' genomes).",

In this game, programs are written in a simplified assembly language and made to compete in the simulated core memory of a computer. The winning program is the one that manages to shut down all processes associated with its competitors. Rasmussen observed that the most successful of these programs were the ones that replicated themselves, so that if one copy were destroyed, others would still persist. In the original \"Core War\" game, the diversity of organisms could not increase, and hence no evolution was possible. Rasmussen designed a system similar to \"Core War\" in which the command that copied instructions was flawed and would sometimes write a random instruction instead on the one intended [43] . This flawed copy command introduced mutations into the system, and thus the potential for evolution. Rasmussen dubbed his new program \"Core World,\" created a simple selfreplicating ancestor, and let it run.",

Arms races transpired where hosts evolved methods of eluding the parasites, and they, in turn, evolved to get around these new defenses.

If an output ever was the sum of two inputs, the successful organisms would receive extra CPU cycles as a bonus. As long as the number of extra cycles was greater than the time it took the organism to perform the computation, the leftover cycles could be applied toward the replication process, providing a competitive advantage to the organism. Sure enough, Adami was able to get the organisms to evolve some simple tasks, but he faced many limitations in trying to use Tierra to study the evolutionary process.",

Furthermore, whereas organisms are executed sequentially in Tierra, the Avida system simulates a parallel computer, allowing all organisms to be executed effectively simultaneously.

Among the four heads, only one, the instruction head (ip), has a counterpart in standard computer architectures. The instruction head corresponds to the instruction pointer in standard architectures and identifies the instruction currently being executed by the CPU. It moves one instruc-tion forward whenever the execution of the previous instruction has been completed, unless that instruction specifically moved the instruction head elsewhere. The other three heads (the read head, the write head, and the flow head) are unique to the Avida virtual hardware. The read and write heads are used in the self-replication process. In order to generate a copy of its genome, an organism must have a means of reading instructions from memory and writing them back to a different location. The read head indicates the position in memory from which instructions are currently being read, and the write head likewise indicates the position to which instructions are currently being written.

The same reasoning applies to Avida genomes, because mutations may cause insertions or deletions of instructions that shift the position of code and would otherwise jeopardize the positions referred to.

However, as we have seen above for the case of template matching, the effect of certain instructions can be modified if they are immediately followed by nop instructions. A similar concept exists for operations that access registers. The inc instruction, for example, increments a register by one. If inc is not followed by any nop, then by default it acts on the BX register. However, if a nop is present immediately after the inc, then the register on which inc acts is specified by the type of the nop. For example, inc nop-A increments the AX register, and inc nop-C increments the CX register. Of course, inc nop-B increments the BX register and, hence, works identical to a single inc command. Similar nop modifications exist for a range of instructions, such as those that perform arithmetic like inc or dec, stack operations such as push or pop, and comparisons such as if-n-equ. The details can be found in [38] or in the Avida documentation. For some instructions that work on two registers -in particular, comparisons -the concept of the complement nop is important because the two registers are specified in this way. Similar to nops in the template matching, registers are cyclically complementary to each other (i.e., BX is the complement to AX, CX to BX, and AX to CX). The instruction if-n-equ, for example, acts on a register and its complement register. By default, if-n-equ compares whether the contents of the BX and CX registers are identical. However, if if-n-equ is followed by a nop-A, then it will compare AX and BX. Now add BX and CX and store the result in AX. 12 nop-A The program continues with BX= 1, CX= 2, and AX= 3.",

Therefore, the first thing an organism has to do at the start of self-replication is to allocate new memory. In the default instruction set, memory allocation is done with the command h-alloc. This command extends the memory by the maximal size that an offspring is allowed to have. As we will discuss later, there are some restrictions on how large or small an offspring is allowed to be in comparison to the parent organism, and the restriction on the maximum size of an offspring determines the amount of memory that h-alloc adds. The allocation always happens at a well-defined position in the memory. Although the memory is considered to be circular in the sense that the CPU will continue with the first instruction of the program once it has executed the last one, the virtual machine nevertheless keeps track of which instruction is the beginning of the program and which is the end. By default, h-alloc (as well as all alternative memory allocation instructions, such as the old allocate) inserts the new memory between the end and the beginning of the program. After the insertion, the new end is at the end of the inserted memory. The newly inserted memory is either initialized to a default instruction, typically nop-A, or to random code, depending on the choice of the experimenter. Fig. 1.4 The h-alloc command extends the memory, so that the program of the offspring can be stored.

Digital evolution allowed us to surmount these difficulties and track all genotypic and phenotypic changes during the evolution of a complex trait with enough replication to obtain statistically powerful results [24] . We isolated the computation EQU (logical equals) as a complex trait and showed that at least 19 coordinated instructions are needed to perform this task. We then performed an experiment that consisted of 100 independent populations of digital organisms being evolved for approx-imately 17,000 generations.

Furthermore, all 23 implementations of the complex trait were unique, with many quite distinct from each other in their approach, indicating that, indeed, this trait had numerous solutions. This observation is not surprising, since even the shortest of the implementations found were extraordinarily unlikely (approximately 1 in 10 27 ). We further analyzed these results by tracing back the line of decent for each population to find the critical mutation that first produced the complex trait. In each case, these random mutations transformed a genotype unable to perform EQU into one that could, and even though these mutations typically affected only 1 to 2 positions in the genome, a median of 28 instructions were required to perform this complex task -a change in any of these instruction would cause the task to be lost, thus it was complex from the moment of its creation. It is noteworthy to mention that in 20 of the 23 cases the critical mutations would have been detrimental if EQU were not rewarded, and in 3 cases the prior mutation was actively detrimental (causing the replication rate for the organisms to drop by as much as half), yet it turned out to be critical for the evolution of EQU; when we reverted these seemingly detrimental mutations, EQU was lost.",

We tested this hypothesis in Avida [53] . First, we let strains of digital organisms evolve to both a high-mutation-rate and a low-mutation-rate environment. The rationale behind this initial adaptation was that strains that evolved at a low mutation rate should adapt to ordinary individual-based selection, whereas strains that evolved at a high mutation rate should adapt to selection on mutant clouds, which means that these organisms should maximize the overall replication rate of their mutant clouds, rather than their individual replication rates. This adaptation to maximize overall replication rate under high mutation pressure takes place when organisms trade individual fitness for mutational robustness, so that their individual replication rate is reduced, but, in return, the probability that mutations cause further reduction in replication rate is also reduced [52] . Specifically, we took 40 strains of already evolved digital organisms and let each evolve for an additional 1000 generations in both a low-mutation-rate and a high-mutation-rate environment. As result, we ended up with 40 pairs of strains. The two strains of each pair were genetically and phenotypically similar, apart from the fact that one was adapted to a low mutation rate and one to a high mutation rate. As expected, we found that in the majority of cases the strains evolved at a a high mutation rate had a lower replication speed than the ones evolved at a low mutation rate.",

            "text": "Next, we let the two types of strains compete with each other, in a setup where both strains would suffer from the same mutation rate, which was either low, intermediate, or high. Not surprisingly, at a low mutation rate the strains adapted to that mutation rate consistently outcompeted the ones adapted to a high mutation rate, since, after all, the former ones had the higher replication rate (we excluded those cases in which the strain that evolved at a low mutation rate had a lower or almost equal fitness to the strain evolved at a high mutation rate). However, without fail, the strain adapted to a high mutation rate could win the competition if the mutation rate during the competition was sufficiently high [53] . This result may sound surprising at first, but it has a very simple explanation. At a high mutation rate (one mutation per genome per generation or higher), the majority of an organism's offspring differ genetically from their parent. Therefore, if the parent is genetically very brittle, so that most of these mutants have a low replication rate or are even lethal, then the overall replication rate of all of the organism's offspring will be fairly moderate, even though the organism itself may produce offspring at a rapid pace. If a different organism produces offspring at a slower pace, but is more robust toward mutations, so that the majority of this organism's offspring have a replication rate similar to that of the parent, then the overall replication rate of this organism's offspring will be larger than the one of the first organism. Hence, this organism will win the competition, even though it is the slower replicator. We termed this effect the \"survival of the flattest,\" because at a sufficiently high mutation rate, a strain that is located at a low but flat fitness peak can outcompete one that is located on a high but steep fitness peak.",

The selective pressures that cause the formation and diversity of ecosystems are still poorly understood [46, 48] . In part, the lack of progress is due to the difficulty of performing precise, replicated, and controlled experiments on whole ecosystems [30] . To study simple ecosystems in a laboratory microcosm (reviewed in [49] ), biologists often use a chemostat, which slowly pumps resource-rich media into a flask containing bacteria, simultaneously draining its contents to keep the volume constant. Unfortunately, even in these model systems, ecosystems can evolve to be more complex than is experimentally tractable and understanding their formation remains difficult [33, 34, 42] .",

We used populations with 2500 organisms, each of which absorbed a small portion of an available resource whenever they performed the corresponding task. If too many organisms focus on the same resource, it will no longer be plentiful enough to encourage additional use. Theory predicts that an environment with either a single resource or with resources in unlimited quantities is capable of supporting only one species [47] , and this is exactly what we see in the standard Avida experiments. It is the competition over multiple, limited resources that is believed to play a key role in the structuring of communities [45, 49] . In 30 trials under the chemostat regime in Avida, a variety of distinct community structures developed [10] . Some evolved nine stably coexisting specialists, one per resource, while others had just a couple of generalists that divided the resources between them. Others still mixed both generalists and specialists. In all cases, the ecosystems proved to be stable because they persisted after all mutations were shut off in the system, and if any abundant phenotype were removed, it would consistently reinvade.",

Even for the latter type of questions, it is sometimes difficult to set up experiments in such a way that they give meaningful results. We must always remember that we are working with an arguably living system that will evolve to survive as best it can, not always in the direction that we intended. Avida has become, in many ways, its own bug tester. If we make a mistake, the organisms will exploit it. For exam-ple, we originally had only 16-bit inputs for the organisms to process; they quickly discovered that random guessing often took less time than actually performing the computation. In this case, the organisms indeed found the most efficient way to solve the problem we gave them, only that it was not the problem we had thought we were giving. This error happened to be easy to find and easy to fix -now all inputs are 32 bits long -but not all \"cheating\" will be so simple to identify and prevent. When performing an Avida experiment, it is always important that we step through the population and try to understand how some of the organisms are functioning.
