In particular, the sonographic evaluation of the heart and lungs is well established and widely implemented in the intensive care unit (ICU) [1, 2]. The use of ultrasound to evaluate the respiratory muscle pump function is relatively new. The relative infrequency with which respiratory muscle ultrasound is employed in clinical practice may be attributable to the complexity of this pump (especially the number of muscles involved), the difficulty in obtaining adequate ultrasound windows, and the common assumption that ultrasound evaluation of the respiratory muscles would not alter patient management in the ICU. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the principles and current applications of respiratory muscle ultrasound and to discuss its limitations and to describe innovative ultrasound-based techniques. We propose a systematic ultrasound-based evaluation of the respiratory muscle pump, integrated with cardiac and lung ultrasound, in ICU patients.",

Contraction of the zone of apposition (cylindroid part of the diaphragm attached to the thoracic outlet) results in caudal movement of the diaphragm dome, and increases intrathoracic volume. When the load imposed on the diaphragm increases, the accessory inspiratory muscles (parasternal-, external intercostal-, scalene-, and sternocleidomastoid muscles) are recruited. With further loading, the expiratory muscles are activated to assist expiration [3]. The most prominent expiratory muscles include the transversus abdominis muscle and the internal- and external oblique muscles. The differential diagnosis of diaphragm weakness is extensive (Table E1).",

The diaphragm appears at a depth of two to four centimeters as a three-layered structure between the pleural and peritoneal membrane (Fig. 1). Characteristically, a white linear structure is seen in the middle of the diaphragm [4, 5]. We recommend measuring diaphragm thickness perpendicular to its fiber direction between the pleural and peritoneal membrane, but not including the membranes (Fig. 1). The lower limit for normal diaphragm thickness is around 1.5 mm in healthy subjects. Reference values are given in Table 1. Diaphragm thickness is affected by body composition and gender [6, 7].",

Thickening fraction of the diaphragm (TFdi) is calculated in B-mode or M-mode as the percentage inspiratory increase in diaphragm thickness relative to end-expiratory thickness during tidal breathing (TFdi) or maximal inspiratory effort (TFdi(max)): TFdi = (end-inspiratory thickness \u2212 end-expiratory thickness)/end-expiratory thickness \u00d7 100% (Fig. 1). Inspiratory thickening of the diaphragm can be used to assess muscle function. Reference values are given in Table 1 and demonstrate a relative wide range in healthy subjects [6, 9\u201311]. A reasonable relationship exists between TFdi and the pressure (or electrical activity) developed by the diaphragm during unassisted breathing [9, 12] and mechanical ventilation [13]. Few studies directly evaluated the correlation between TFdi and muscle pressure (Pmus) [14, 15] and, therefore, care should be taken when estimating Pmus from TFdi.",

The diaphragm is identified as a bright line covering the liver and the spleen. Obtaining a clear image of the left hemidiaphragm can be difficult due to the poor acoustic window of the spleen. During inspiration, the diaphragm should move toward the probe (Fig. 1). Excursion is quantified in M-mode, with the M-line placed perpendicular to the direction of motion (Fig. 1); the sweep speed is best adjusted to around 10 mm/s to obtain a minimum of three respiratory cycles within one image. Diaphragm excursion should only be measured during unassisted breathing (i.e., T-piece or minimum tolerable CPAP level), since active contraction of the diaphragm cannot be distinguished from passive displacement due to ventilator inspiratory pressures [4, 12].",

Preliminary data seem to demonstrate reasonable correlation between TFabd and expiratory force generation [29]. It should be noted that expiratory muscles have more degrees of freedom compared to the diaphragm; active contraction of one muscle layer may directly affect the shortening and position of the adjacent layer, which may make interpretation of TFabd more complex. Moreover, the relationship between shortening, thickening, and pressure generation is complex because of the geometry of the abdominal muscles during contraction (a \u2018shrinking\u2019 sphere rather than a \u2018shortening piston-in-a-cylinder\u2019 like the diaphragm). Future studies should confirm the relationship between expiratory muscle pressure and TFabd and its clinical relevance.",

The clinical presentation of diaphragm dysfunction depends on the cause, severity and rate of progression (E-Table 1) [32]. A characteristic physical sign of bilateral diaphragm dysfunction is supine abdominal paradox: activity of accessory inspiratory muscles generates a negative inspiratory thoracic pressure (though the same pattern may be observed when respiratory loads are increased) [33]. As the diaphragm is paralyzed, this negative pressure is transferred to the abdomen, resulting in inward movement of the abdominal wall. The ultrasound corollary of this is cranial excursion of the diaphragm during inspiration, measured in M-mode. In addition, severe isolated diaphragm weakness results in an increased thickening fraction of the accessory respiratory muscles [24]. Therefore, respiratory muscle ultrasound is an excellent modality to diagnose (unilateral) diaphragm weakness or paralysis in patients with acute respiratory failure [34, 35].",

            "text": "In patients with acute hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD), diaphragm ultrasound may be used to predict success of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Increased diaphragm excursion during NIV (> 18 mm vs < 12 mm) was associated with NIV success and a decrease in Paco2 after one hour [38, 39]. Air trapping has been found to be the major limiting factor in diaphragm excursion in COPD patients [40]; therefore, improved excursion is probably an indication of reduced pulmonary hyperinflation. In a cohort of patients with AE-COPD requiring ICU admission (n = 41), TFdi < 20% was associated with NIV-failure (R = 0.51) [41], which was confirmed in a larger (n = 75) follow-up study (risk ratio for NIV-failure 4.4) [42]. Diaphragm ultrasound may thus reduce the risk of delayed intubation in patients with severe AE-COPD requiring NIV; however, further validation is required.",

            "text": "It has been postulated that both ventilator over-assist and ventilator under-assist, resulting in muscle atrophy and muscle injury, respectively, play an important role in critical illness-associated diaphragm weakness pathophysiology [13]. To limit these detrimental consequences, it seems reasonable to titrate ventilator support such that diaphragm effort is within physiological limits, the so-called diaphragm protective mechanical ventilation [13, 43, 44]. The optimal level of diaphragm activity is currently unknown and may vary under different conditions (e.g., sepsis, weakness); however, a relatively low level of diaphragm activity, corresponding to esophageal pressure swings of 4\u20138 cm H2O appears safe [45]. The role of ultrasound in diaphragm protective ventilation has not been specifically studied, but assessment of TFdi, as a proxy for effort, is a reasonable approach. Data from Goligher and colleagues demonstrate that a TFdi between 15 and 30% during the first days of mechanical ventilation is associated with stable muscle thickness [44] and the shortest duration of ventilation [13]. Accordingly, a low TFdi (< 15%) in a patient on a partially supported ventilatory mode raises the possibility of ventilator over-assist; therefore, decreasing assist, while monitoring other respiratory parameters (e.g., tidal volume, respiratory rate), is a reasonable approach. The upper limit for TFdi allowing diaphragm protective ventilation is more controversial. Although a moderate and statistically significant correlation exists between TFdi and diaphragm effort (Pdi, PTP) [9, 14], the range of diaphragm effort at a certain TFdi is large. We suggest that in patients with TFdi > 30\u201350%, ventilator support may be increased under the monitoring of other respiratory parameters to avoid hyperinflation. Given the relative imprecision of TFdi measurements, other techniques for monitoring respiratory effort should be considered.",

Using the same cutoff, no association was found between diaphragm dysfunction and extubation failure [51]. Interestingly, when diaphragm excursion is measured after 30 min from initiation of a 2 h SBT, predictive performance of 10 mm cutoff seems to be significantly higher (AUROC 0.88) [52]. Post-cardiac surgery patients with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis could be extubated without delay, when the contralateral diaphragm excursion was > 25 mm at maximal inspiratory effort [53]. In a meta-analysis of 10 studies evaluating diaphragm excursion to predict weaning failure and combining different definitions of weaning failure, the authors reported a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI 65\u201385) and specificity of 75% (95% CI 60\u201385), with substantial heterogeneity [54].

In most patients, post-extubation distress is the result of a combination of cardiac dysfunction, impaired gas exchange, and/or diaphragmatic dysfunction. Therefore, in patients with weaning failure we suggest the use of a structured and integrated approach that combines clinical parameters, laboratory parameters (e.g., pro-BNP) and the sonographic assessment of the lung, heart and the respiratory muscles [61]. Here, we present the ABCDE-Ultrasound approach, an intuitive aid designed to standardize the sonographic approach to weaning failure (Fig. 2). A similar but less exhaustive approach has been suggested by Mayo et al. [62]. The use of ultrasound to evaluate the heart and lung has been described in this Intensive Care Medicine critical care ultrasound series [1, 2]. Timing of ultrasound examination depends on the clinical question. For identification of patients at high-risk of weaning failure, the examination is performed before the SBT. For prediction of weaning outcome or to diagnose the cause of weaning failure, the examination is best done after the start and/or end of an SBT [62].",

Patient\u2013ventilator asynchrony is associated with worse outcome [64] and occurs in up to half of mechanically ventilated patients. Visual inspection of the airway flow and pressure signal may detect asynchrony, but was shown to be unreliable [65]. Both measurements of esophageal pressure and diaphragm electrical activity are used as state-of-the-art techniques to assess patient\u2013ventilator interactions [66]. These two techniques are invasive, limiting their use in daily practice. Diaphragm ultrasound might be a reasonable alternative to detect most types of patient\u2013ventilator asynchrony (Table 3), but further studies are needed to determine its exact role [4, 67].",

Measurements were performed after marking the probe location. Intra-observer and inter-observer reproducibility coefficients for end-expiratory diaphragm thickness were 0.2 mm and 0.4 mm, respectively [68], meaning it is expected that the absolute difference between two measurements by the same observer does not differ by more than 0.2 mm on 95% of occasions (or 0.4 mm in case of two different observers). However, it should be kept in mind that 0.2 mm represents approximately 10% of total diaphragm thickness at end expiration. While in general diaphragm ultrasound seems to be a reliable technique to assess changes in diaphragm thickness over time, comparing individual patient results should be done with a degree of caution and only after adequate training, as small observer-dependent variations (e.g., measurement location, probe angulation) will affect results.",

Unclarity of surrounding membranes and insufficient ultrasound beam angulation to muscle axis may lead to measurement error. Furthermore, the spatial axial resolution (depth resolution, i.e., \u00bd spatial pulse length) of the probe plays a critical role. Given that the ultrasound pulse length is typically two cycles and that the ultrasound wavelength of a 10 MHz transducer is 0.15 mm (i.e., wavelength = speed of sound in soft tissue/frequency = 1540 m/s/10 MHz = 0.15 mm), the corresponding depth resolution is \u00bd (2 \u00d7 0.15) = 0.15 mm, which is in the same order as the intra-observer reproducibility and sufficient in order to visualize the diaphragm. Based on the ultrasound technique and equipment used, identification of the smallest detectable change that is permitted is fundamental to distinguish true changes in muscle thickness from artifact.",

Potential applications include assessment of regional diaphragm contractile function at rest and with loading, and measurement of diaphragm relaxation velocity. Diaphragm relaxation abnormalities have been described as a marker of impaired contractility in patients who failed weaning [71], but nowadays they can only be assessed with invasive esophageal or diaphragmatic pressure measurements (or possibly M-mode excursion decay).",

It was recently demonstrated that strain and strain rate were highly correlated to transdiaphragmatic pressure in healthy subjects [72].
