Acute Physiology and Chronic\nHealth Evaluation II scores (APACHE II), sequential organ failure assessment, and CURB-65\ncriteria were determined within 24 h after admission. Data on all treatment measures,\nincluding antibiotic, antivirus, glucocorticoid, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and\nrespiratory support, were acquired during hospitalization.

            "text": "Enhanced platelet activation leading to platelet deposition in damaged pulmonary blood\nvessels has been supported by various clinical studies, and thrombocytopenia is an important\nfeature of SARS [11,12].\nThrombocytopenia has exceeded 50% incidence rate in patients with SARS and is an important\nindicator of poor prognosis [13\u201315]. A\nmeta-analysis with 1779 COVID-19 patients reported that thrombocytopenia was associated with\nthreefold-enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 and an lower platelet count was observed with\nmortality [16]. Similar to this study, the current work confirmed\nthat thrombocytopenia at admission is associated with death in patients with COVID-19.\nPlatelets in patients with SARS are negatively correlated with their sVCAM-1 levels. sVCAM-1\nis involved in adhesion and chemotaxis and contributes to early vascular injury and\nsuppression of T cell function. Vascular injury or immunosuppression may explain the poor\noutcome [17]. By using the Cox regression model for multivariate\nanalysis, we found that platelets and PCT are independent risk factors that predict death.\nAlthough platelets were routinely measured daily, the role of platelets and PCT in\npredicting the outcome of patients with COVID-19 has not been previously reported, and the\ncorrelation between platelet dynamics and disease prognosis has not been studied. Different\nplatelet thresholds have been used in epidemiological studies for the incidence, risk\nfactors, and consequences of thrombocytopenia among critically ill patients [18,19]. In our cohort, a non-linear\nrelationship between platelets at admission and mortality was observed, and the trend tends\nto be gentle when platelet count >200 \u00d7 109/L (Figure\n3a). Further analysis showed that patients with a platelet level\n<200 \u00d7 109/L at admission and decrease in 7 days had the highest mortality\nrate, whereas those with a platelet level >200 \u00d7 109/L at admission and increase in 7 days\nhad the lowest mortality rate. Moreover, thrombocytopenia had a close relationship with\nprognosis even within the normal reference range. The dynamic changes of platelets within\nthe first 7 days after admission were negatively correlated with the prognosis. Cox\nproportional hazards regression models displayed a 40% decrease in mortality risk for every\n50 \u00d7 109/L increase in platelets. In summary, platelet count is an important\nprognostic marker for patients with COVID-19, and the dynamic levels of platelets during\ntreatment are closely associated with death. PCT was calculated from platelet count, and its\nlevels at admission still retained a detrimental effect on clinical outcome [20].",

            "text": "The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 on thrombocytopenia is poorly understood, but several potential\nexplanations are considered [21]. Histological examinations of\nlung necropsy from patients with COVID-19 revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with\ncellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates as\ndominated by lymphocytes; this finding has raised the possibility of immunopathological\ndamage for lung tissues [22]. Damaged lung tissues would cause\nplatelet activation and aggregation in the lungs, and thrombi formation at the site of the\ninjury may lead to the consumption of platelets and megakaryocytes. In addition, SARS-CoV-2\ninduces a low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulopathy state characterized by the\nelevation of D-dimers and fibrinogen and further increases the consumption of platelets in\ndamaged lungs. The lungs may be the sites of platelet release from mature megakaryocytes\n[23]. Inflammation and long-term oxygen treatment also result\nin extensive alveolar damage and other pulmonary pathological changes. The pulmonary\ncapillary bed is morphologically altered, thus further affecting the lung megakaryocyte\nfragmentation and megakaryocytopoiesis. The increased consumption and decreased production\nof platelet may affect thrombocytopenia. Similar to SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2\nthrombocytopenia may involve other mechanisms. This new condition may directly infect\nhematopoietic precursor cells and inhibit their growth. CD 13 and CD66a are expressed on\nhuman bone marrow CD34+ cells. SARS-CoV-2 may induce growth inhibition by binding to the\nCD13 or CD66a of hematopoietic cells and bone marrow stromal cells, resulting in abnormal\nhematopoiesis and immunodeficiency [21]. The body undergoes\nimmune-mediated hematopoietic stem cell damage, thereby further leading to\nthrombocytopenia.",
