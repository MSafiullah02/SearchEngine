Often our Issues have a paper or two at the end on an important topic different than the theme for the Issue. However, due to so many important topics in the field of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the ability to attract top authors on so many different topics, at Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (PCVD), we will start having probably one Issue per year on assorted topics in CVD, starting with this May/June 2020 Issue.",

These papers should generate interest outside of our current CVD readership. We also have 2 papers in this issue on the topic of heart transplantation (HT) from one of the leaders in the world, Dr. Mandeep Mehra from Harvard and Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation. One of the papers is on anticoagulation for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in HT and the other is on cardiac allograft vasculopathy, a topic that Dr. Mehra has worked on for nearly 3 decades and one that should be of high interest to many in CVD, especially specialists in advanced heart failure and HT.",
