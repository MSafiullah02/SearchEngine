The psychological mechanisms that determine stress, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures, are not yet clear. In a survey during the lockdown in Switzerland (n=1565), we found substantially increased levels of stress in the population. In particular, individuals who did not agree with the containment measures, as well as those who saw nothing positive in the crisis, experienced even higher levels of stress. In contrast, individuals who are part of a risk group or who are working in healthcare or in essential shops experienced similar stress levels as the general public. We conducted a path analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms during lockdown. Experiencing fear of the disease is a key driver for being worried. Our model further shows that worries about the individual, social, and economic consequences of the crisis, strongly boost stress. The infection rate in the canton (i.e. state) of residence also contributes to stress. Positive thinking and perceived social, organizational, and governmental support mitigate worries and stress. To prevent stress, authorities should explain containment measures well, highlight positive aspects of the crisis, address worries, and facilitate support.",

Mitigation measures boost worries and stress, particularly for those individuals who feel that these measures are not sufficient or go too far. Highlighting positive aspects about the crisis and convincing people of the effectiveness and the necessity of containment measures may not only boost compliance, but also decrease stress, since individuals feel protected by the authorities and experience less worries. This, in turn, will hopefully limit the impact on mental health as a consequence of the crisis. Providing support is another important way to mitigate worries, enable coping, and reduce stress.",

We used the Perceived Stress Scale (PPS-10) (10-items) (13, 14) . The widely-used PSS is based on the stress-related components of unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloading life events (e.g. \"In the last month, how often have you been angry because of things that were outside your control?\"), (0=never; 4=very often).
