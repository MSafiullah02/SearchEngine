While different \u2018models\u2019 have been used, the basic premise is that PBL is \u2018a way of constructing and teaching courses using problems as the stimulus and focus for student activity\u2019 (Boud & Feletti, 1991, p. 14). When investigating \u2018real-life\u2019 problems, students work co-operatively in a small group, usually with the assistance of a tutor and with access to other resources to: (a) clarify the problem; (b) identify learning needs to address the problem; (c) undertake individual reading/study; and, (d) apply newly acquired insights and understandings to re-address the problem. The aim is that students acquire \u2018knowledge and skills through a staged sequence of problems presented in context\u2019 (Boud & Feletti, 1991, p. 14).",

By framing courses around \u2018real\u2019 problems in the context of \u2018real\u2019 practice, PBL has presented a coherent and practical approach to learning which incorporates \u2018active\u2019 rather than \u2018passive\u2019 approaches to the development of critical thinking skills, experiential and social learning in the form of collaborative inquiry based on engaging with authentic problems, and more dynamic interactions between teachers and learners based on respect for students\u2019 prior learning and experience (Hendry et al., 1999, McPhee, 2002).

However, there has not been widespread adoption of the proposals presented in the Five Year Strategy (CITE, 2001, Coniam, 2002). There are many reasons, including the difficulties imposed by building designs (multi-story buildings and small classrooms), the general conditions of teachers (large classes, heavy teaching loads), and the expectations held by teachers, students and parents about the need to \u2018cover the content\u2019 if students are to be prepared for examinations designed to assess knowledge of content (Dimmock, 2000). In secondary school classrooms, the dominant use of ICT has been the display of PowerPoint presentations (Ki, 2000, Pearson, 2003, Yuen and Lee, 2000), an attempt to \u2018technologize\u2019 (CITE, 2001, p. ii) existing \u2018transmission of content\u2019 methods of teaching rather than fundamentally change teaching/learning approaches along the lines envisaged in the Five Year Strategy and other curriculum reform documents.",

The aims of using ICT, and why these have been selected, need to be examined critically so that the implications for teaching, learning, content and assessment can be clarified and ideas about new directions in which to proceed can be elaborated. At the same time, many practical matters associated with the management of ICT resources have to be considered. Given these challenges, it was considered that the adoption of an explicit PBL pedagogy would be an appropriate way in which students could critically examine recent policy initiatives in ICT (and curriculum reforms outlined in other policy documents) and, at the same time grapple with the difficulties which often arise when attempts are made to translate new initiatives into practice in the school setting. Presenting the mature age teachers enrolled in this MEd module with an opportunity to discuss ICT in a structured way also raised the possibility that new knowledge/insights about using ICT in schools might be generated which was considered to be less likely to occur when only a tutor\u2019s perspective was under consideration and evaluation. Hence, the module was designed around genuine problems in an attempt to create \u2018new\u2019 knowledge about ICT in the business curriculum.",

However, the following definition encapsulated two key ideas that influenced the curriculum design of the module.PBL is both a curriculum and a process. The curriculum consists of carefully selected and designed problems that demand from the learner acquisition of critical knowledge, problem-solving proficiency, self-directed learning strategies and team participation skills. The process replicates the commonly used systemic approaches to resolving problems or meeting challenges that are encountered in life and career.

While these variations may be due to lack of familiarity with content discussed, they may also be due to: (a) confidence with English as a second language; (b) the assigned roles of leader and recorder/presenter; and (c) the lack of awareness by the leader of the need to encourage all group members to contribute.

But, once they go into Year 2, they need more specialised software like databases, accounting software, Oracle, etc. These are very expensive . . . So, it is not only a matter of whether our students have a computer at home which I assume the majority have these days, but the availability of the software required in various subjects.

However, the views attributed to the Head of Department in the case study \u2013 which represented the views of the tutor for the module \u2013 are prominent while other views about new technology, such as those of other teachers in the case study remain in the background. This tended to put students in the module in the role of \u2018problem solver\u2019 (how the Head of Department could get what she wanted) rather than \u2018problem investigator\u2019 (what views did teachers have about ICT and how could these impact on the adoption of new technology). On reflection, it was felt that other views should have been more prominent. As Fenwick and Parsons (1998, p. 11) note:there may sometimes be pedagogical purposes best served through student analysis of pre-determined cases. But when descriptive situations are presented to students, they require a great deal of narrative and contextual detail, providing as many perspectives as possible. Rather than casting a student professional into the role of the omniscient solver in these cases, they might serve a better purpose as stories of how a particular person or group of people defined a situation and responded to it. Pre-service professionals could then spend time analysing how these problem cases selected for study have been constructed and what assumptions about right practice and ways of viewing the world are embedded in their frameworks. Students can explore ways the problem-namer lives within the situation configured as problematic.\n",
