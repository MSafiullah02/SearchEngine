There are at least 3 imported cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome in Thailand, and the disease control is successful. All patients were from the Middle East and received early diagnoses for Middle East respiratory syndrome. All patients were treated in the same tertiary hospital with a standard isolation unit.2 The key factors for success in disease control are early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and sufficient facilities for management of contagious disease. Focusing on prevention of further nosocomial infection to medical personnel, strict infection prevention and control is proven for effectiveness. According to a recent survey on the hospital that was used for management of imported Middle East respiratory syndrome cases, \u201call contacts reported 100% compliance with hand hygiene, using N95 respirator, performing respirator fit test, wearing gown, gloves, eye protection, and cap during their entire working period.3\u201d Nevertheless, a big concern is availability of standard ventilation-filtration units for respiratory isolation. Sufficient respiratory isolation units are required.",
