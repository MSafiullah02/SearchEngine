            "text": "As members of the papain superfamily [1], cathepsins are involved in many biological processes related to human diseases and disorders [1], [2], [3], [4]. Previously identified cathepsins include cathepsin B, D, H, K, L, and S. Several of these proteins have been selected as biological targets to develop therapeutic treatments, and a number of inhibitors have been identified and developed for many of these enzymes. Cathepsin B inhibitors are highly sought after chemical agents since many diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorder, cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], have been connected with unusual levels or abnormal function of cathepsin B. As an ubiquitous lysosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin B has been found to be responsible for intracellular as well as extracellular proteolysis in mammalian cells and can facilitate cell migration by dissolving the extracellular barriers, which result in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis [13], [14], [15]. The biological activity and function of cathepsin B is also important during viral infection and replication for several viruses, such as Ebola, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in human cells [16], [17]. Due to its important biological functions, which are directly related to several important human diseases, cathepsin B has been chosen as a drug development target in many efforts.",

Most of these cathepsin inhibitors disable the biological activity of cathepsin B through forming irreversible covalent chemical bond in the catalytic site of the enzyme. These irreversible inhibitors include dipeptidyl nitriles [21], vinyl sulfones, expoxysuccinates, acyloxymethyl ketones, fluoromethyl ketones, hydrazides, and bis-\u03b1-amidoketones [22]. Structural studies have provided detailed insights into the biological mechanisms of these inhibitors. Inhibitors bind to the catalytic active site of cathepsin B, and form an irreversible covalent bond with the protein in the active site [21], [23]. Meanwhile, computational studies, such as docking and virtual screening, were also used to explore the binding and inhibition mechanism of these inhibitors [24], [25], [26]. These computational approaches have proved efficient and essential for optimizing and designing chemical agents with improved biological activities [27], [28], [29].",

A relative binding affinity was calculated for each compound studied based on the respective modeled bound structure using the linear response molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann-surface area method (LR-MM-PBSA). Strong correlations between the calculated binding affinities and experimental biological activities were obtained [30], [31]. Three-dimensional (3D) Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships (QSAR) models were also established based on the multi-conformation method with high correlation coefficients for these active compounds (to be published). Given the importance of the enzyme in disease treatment and the broad research interest to screen and identify potent inhibitors, efforts have been taken further to build the QSAR models to correlate the molecular and physicochemical properties with the biological activities of the compounds tested in the Cathepsin B inhibition screening experiments. Efforts were also undertaken to build statistical models to classify inhibition activities against Cathepsin B for specific compounds. This work reports the results of the continuous (continuous in bioactivity space) and binary (two discrete bioactivity status, e.g. \u2018active\u2019 vs. \u2018inactive\u2019) QSAR models in order to obtain insight into the relationship of chemical structure and physicochemical properties/biological activity. Additionally, the results of this work may provide means to pre-screen compounds to facilitate in silico design of de novo cathepsin B inhibitors and the development of drugs for the treatment of various human diseases using some other molecular targets.",

In Bioassay AID (Pubchem bioassay accession) 820, 75 compounds were tested by a dose\u2013response confirmatory screening experiment, whereas 37 compounds were confirmed to have inhibitory activity, 35 compounds were confirmed to have no inhibitory activity, and the bioactivity outcome for the remaining 3 compounds were reported as \u201cinconclusive\u201d. By further examining these active compounds using different experimental protocol, assay depositors suggested that some of them were likely artifacts. Further investigation using several independent bioassay tests (different biological experiments), which may be affected by similar causes of artifact, suggested that five compounds bear greater chance as being false positives, and they were removed from the current analysis. So, 32 active (37 \u2212 5) and 35 inactive compounds from bioassay 820 were included in the work. Bioassay 523 employed a similar experimental protocol to the Bioassay 820, where 27 compounds were tested, 10 compounds were confirmed having inhibitory activity, 16 compounds were confirmed having no inhibitory activity, and one compound was reported as \u201cinconclusive\u201d. Four out of the 10 active compounds are unique structures and were added to the active compound list. Total 36 active compounds (32 from bioassay 820 and 4 from bioassay 523) and 51 inactive compounds (35 from bioassay 820 and 16 from bioassay 523) were used in the modeling. The average IC50 reported in the bioassay depositions was used for the bioactivity of the active compounds. The PubChem compound accession (CID), molecular formula, and biological activity (IC50) for the 86 compounds are listed in Table 1\n(one active compound was not included in QSAR modeling as no 3D conformer was obtained in docking simulation). Molecular structure and other information can be obtained from PubChem website based on CIDs (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the bioassay protocol information can be obtained from PubChem website by BioAssay ID (AID) 820 and 523 (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=820 and http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=523) [32]. The compounds tested in the confirmatory assays were cherry picked based on the screening results for over 60,000 compounds in a single dose HTS assay for potential cathepsin B inhibition activity (PubChem AID: 453) by measuring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) from the hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. The large number of inactive compounds from the primary HTS assay was not included in the model since the statistical methods typically do not perform well on unbalanced data sets. Therefore claiming all compounds as inactive will yield an accuracy of 99.94% as pointed out by Weis et al. [37].",

Hydrogen atoms and partial charges were added to the protein and then short steps of minimization were performed to relax the newly added hydrogen atoms and the potential steric contacts in the original PDB coordinates. The minimizations were performed using an OPLS force field following the standard protocol of the Glide program (version 8 in FirstDiscovery suite) [38], [39]. The minimized protein structure was then used to generate a docking grid which was used to docked all active compounds into the DPN binding site.

The nine descriptors that demonstrated an apparent correlation with the observed biological activity were chosen to build QSAR models, which are listed in Table 2. Among these descriptors, N\nacc+don is the sum of the counts of hydrogen acceptor and donor. Apol, MR, and Dipole are the sum of atomic polarizabilities [41], molar refractivity, and the dipole moment of a molecule calculated from the partial charges of the molecule, respectively.

The former corresponds to a \u00b110-fold variation ranges or with a range of a single order of magnitude on each direction from the experimental value of IC50 and the latter corresponds to \u00b13.33-fold variation ranges or within a window of a single order of magnitude on IC50. The non-validated model based on 9 descriptors (properties) showed strong ability to predict the biological activities with errors (difference between the predicted value and experimental value) of smaller than one unit for all 42 compounds. Twenty-six compounds (62%) have predicted errors smaller than or equal to 0.5 unit by the model. Model evaluation using the LOO validation method generated satisfactory results. The observed activities vs. the predicted activities by the non-validated fitting model and cross-validated model are plotted in Fig. 3A. By further checking the predicted results of the cross-validation model, it was noted that the three compounds (compounds 24, 26 and 34) had predicted errors close to one unit. When these three compounds were treated as outliers and excluded from the model construction, the new model (3 outlier model) consisting of the remaining 39 compounds demonstrated an improved quality. The predicted activities for these 39 compounds are listed in Table 4\n. All compounds have predicted errors smaller than one unit in the non-validated model and 37 compounds have predicted errors smaller than on unit in the cross-validated model. Twenty-seven and more than half compounds have predicted errors smaller than half unit according to the non-validated and cross-validated results, respectively. These cross-validation results demonstrated the strong predictability of the constructed models for the application of cathepsin B inhibition activity prediction.",

The binary QSAR model was developed as an economic QSAR model to be used distinguish active vs. inactive compounds in HTS experiments to assist model drug development. All binary models were built using the binary method module of MOE [42], [43]. Similarly to the process of continuous model construction, the \u201call binary model\u201d was first built with all 86 compounds to examine the predictability of the model for the \u201cinside\u201d compounds, the compounds used to build a model, and followed by validations using the LOO method and three training-test sets to examine the predictability and robustness of the QSAR models for \u201coutside\u201d compounds. The predicted results for the all binary model are listed in Table 9\nand the statistical results are listed in Table 13. All 86 compounds, except for four active and three inactive ones, were predicted correctly with this non-validated model (Table 9). The prediction accuracies (Table 13) for all compounds are 0.919, and for active and inactive compounds are 0.886 and 0.941 respectively. This demonstrates the strong classification power of this model for discriminating inactive compounds from active compounds. In addition, four cross-validated models were built, one from LOO and three from the training-test-set method. In the latter three models, the compounds were randomly split into training set (80 compounds) and test set (6 compounds). The four models were designated as \u201cbinary model\u201d, \u201cbin. train-test 1\u201d, \u201cbin. train-test 2\u201d, and \u201cbin. train-test 3\u201d, and the predicted results from these four cross-validated models are listed in Table 9, Table 10, Table 11, Table 12\n. The three training-test models produced consistent results that are similar to those from the LOO-based binary model. For the 80 training set compounds, the non-validated prediction accuracies for all compounds are 0.906\u20139.25, and for active and inactive compounds are 0.906 and 0.938, respectively. The cross-validated prediction accuracies for all compounds are 0.900, active and inactive compounds are 0.844 and 0.938, respectively. For the six test compounds, five compounds were predicted correctly, the prediction accuracies for the randomly selected test compounds in all three training-test models are 0.833 (Table 13\n). These validated models clearly demonstrated their abilities to distinguish active vs. inactive compounds with high efficiency and accuracy, which indicates their strong potential for in silico screening of small molecules.",

Such shift results in more active compounds at the border line of being classified as \u201cinactive\u201d. To solve the problem, one could design a weighting schema to \u201coverestimate\u201d the type of compounds that are underrepresented in the data set.

With the three training-test models, the bioactivity categories for the five out of six tested compounds were predicted correctly, with a prediction accuracy of 0.833.

The robustness and feasibility of this binary method indicates its potential in several applications to facilitate molecular design and drug development. In particular, this approach may prove highly efficient for pre-screening in silico designed compounds to optimize the biological activities based on the information of known bioactive compounds. Such in silico pre-screening may be performed to filter out the ones that are unlikely to have the desired biological activities, thus to allow the limited efforts to be focused on the highly promising candidates.
