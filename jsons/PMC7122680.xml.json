Indeed, the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reported that the highest permanent central line utilization rates in 2013 were in pediatric general hematology-oncology and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) wards [1]. These units also reported substantial temporary central line use. CLABSI, however, are the most common healthcare-associated infection (HAI) affecting pediatric hematology-oncology patients. Table 11.1 lists the relative rates of CLABSI observed across different patient populations and catheter types. As in adults, these contribute significantly to mortality, hospital length of stay, and costs [1, 2].\n",

Thrombin covering the intravascular portion of the catheter and the biofilm produced by many microbial pathogens promotes the adhesion of pathogens. The risk of subsequent bloodstream infection is dependent on both the number of organisms and their intrinsic virulence. Host, underlying disease, and treatment characteristics also contribute to the risk of CLABSI [4, 5].",

These surveillance strategies have also been applied to infections in ambulatory pediatric hematology and oncology patients [4, 6]. Specific criteria for bloodstream infections developed by the CDC Prevention Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (Table 11.2) distinguish between a CLABSI, an infection occurring in a patient who has had a central line in place for >2 days, and a catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), a CLABSI for which specific laboratory testing has identified the central line as the source of the infection [7]. Practically, it is sometimes not possible to implicate or exclude the catheter because the appropriate laboratory test was not feasible (e.g., if the central line is not removed and cultures of the catheter tip, therefore, not possible) or not obtained (e.g., simultaneous blood cultures from both the central line and a peripheral vein for comparison of time to positivity). The simpler definition of CLABSI has, therefore, been used for NHSN surveillance although it is recognized that it is less specific than desirable.\n",

More recently, it has been recognized that many bloodstream infections in persons with cancer or severe neutropenia from other causes, or who have undergone HSCT, are not CRBSI, but result from the translocation of gastrointestinal microorganisms to the bloodstream, particularly in patients with severe neutropenia or who have gastrointestinal graft versus host disease [9]. Use of CLABSI as a surveillance definition in these populations, therefore, overestimates the proportion of bloodstream infections that are attributable to central lines and has implications for whether or not these infections may be prevented by traditional approaches or, indeed, if these infections are preventable at all [10]. In 2013, the NHSN introduced a new surveillance definition of \u201cmucosal injury-associated laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection\u201d (MBI-LCBI, Table 11.2). Additional studies of the impact of distinguishing MBI-LCBI from CLABSI in high-risk pediatric and adult populations are ongoing.\n",

C. difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus. Intestinal colonization occurs when infectious spores, which may persist for long periods in the environment, are ingested. Some strains elaborate two homologous exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B,which bind to and damage intestinal epithelial cells and incite strong inflammatory responses [13]. North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 (NAP1) PCR ribotype 027 strains of toxogenic C. difficile, which express more toxin A and B than other strains and an additional binary toxin, emerged in the early 2000s. Now commonly found in North America, these strains are associated with more severe disease in adults, but it is not yet clear whether they are more pathogenic in either children or cancer patients [14].",

The most commonly recognized risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use; others include antineoplastic chemotherapy, the use of proton pump inhibitors, gastrointestinal surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunocompromising conditions [15]. Adults with cancer and recipients of HSCT are at significantly greater risk of CDI than the general hospital population, with rates ranging from 3.4% to 27% [16]. Disease manifestations range from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis. Complications such as toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, and sepsis are responsible for an estimated fatality rate of up to 15% in adults [12]. Malignancy is also a strong predictor of recurrent CDI. Most children with healthcare-associated CDI have underlying medical comorbidities, with malignancy being the most common. Up to 25% of cases of CDI in hospitalized children occur in those with cancer, a rate tenfold higher than that observed in children without cancer [17, 18]. Boyle reported 17% of pediatric HSCT recipients older than 1 year of age developed CDI within 100 days of transplant (20/10,000 patient days), significantly higher than that the rate observed in adult recipients [19]. Severe and complicated disease appear to be less common in children than adults, but more frequent in children with cancer than those without malignancy [15, 16, 20].",

This and other clinical and surveillance definitions have significant limitations that may affect estimates of the incidence of CDI in pediatric oncology patients. Over half of young children, especially those <2 years of age, and almost a third of pediatric oncology patients may be asymptomatically colonized by C. difficile, often for long periods of time [22\u201324]. Some investigators have suggested that sensitive molecular diagnostic tests, such as nucleic acid amplification of toxin A and B genes, are more likely to overestimate the incidence of CDI than older assays because these are more likely to identify the clinically inconsequential carriage of C. difficile [22]. Viruses and other gastrointestinal co-pathogens are also detected in as many as 80% of children, including immunocompromised children with CDI, making it difficult to judge the contribution of each potential pathogen to diarrheal disease [25, 26]. Importantly, however, patients who are colonized with toxogenic C. difficile may still represent a source of environmental shedding and transmission of infectious spores. Judicious use of antimicrobials, infection prevention precautions, and environmental cleaning are the mainstays of CDI prevention in healthcare settings.",

Reactivation of latent pulmonary or systemic infection, such as cytomegalovirus or tuberculosis, in oncology and transplant patients, including children, may be indistinguishable from VAP. Some features of the current NHSN surveillance definition make its application to children problematic. Respiratory specimens, for example, must be obtained by methods that limit contamination, such as bronchoalveolar lavage, that may have technical limitations and greater risks in young patients [30]. Recognizing the limitation of VAP surveillance definitions, NHSN surveillance began to assess a broader range of ventilator-associated events, including VAP, in adults in 2015 [31]. A pediatric-specific algorithm for VAP is not yet available, but one study that applied adult definitions retrospectively to PICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation suggests that this strategy may be useful [32].",

VAP may, like conventional pneumonia, result from the inhalation of infectious aerosols or complicate hematogenous bacteremia or fungemia. The presence of the same microorganisms in the oropharynx and in endotracheal aspirates, however, suggests that a frequent and potentially preventable cause of VAP is the aspiration of microorganisms colonizing the endotracheal tube (ET), oropharynx, or stomach [37]. Micro-aspiration of upper airway secretions around the uncuffed ET commonly used in infants and children or through channels formed by folds in low-pressure high-volume cuffed ET may be exacerbated by the impairment of mucociliary clearance and pooling of secretions in the subglottic airway. Risk factors for VAP in children include a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, prior antimicrobial exposure, and the use of immunosuppressing drugs, particularly corticosteroids [38]. Additional contributing elements may include the replacement of the usual microbiological flora of the oropharynx and stomach by more virulent species (such as Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli), the contamination of suction equipment (particularly associated with the use of open systems and nonsterile solutions), and the presence of a nasogastric tube, enteral feeding, poor oral hygiene, gastric distension, and positioning (with the semirecumbent position associated with a lower risk of VAP than the supine position). The contribution of each of these elements to the pathogenesis of VAP in pediatric hematology-oncology patients has not been studied; most prevention strategies target multiple risk factors for infection.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that, unless medical contraindications exist, all healthcare personnel should be vaccinated annually to protect themselves, their families, and their patients against influenza [48]. Similar recommendations exist for the use of tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for the prevention of pertussis [49]. These recommendations direct organizations to provide vaccine as part of employee health programs and to make efforts to reduce administrative and financial barriers to immunization [50]. Personnel refusing influenza vaccination for reasons other than a documented medical contraindication should sign a written declination that outlines the risks of vaccine refusal. Influenza immunization of HCP is tracked by the NHSN. During the 2014\u20132015 season, 88.6% of employees and 84.5% of all healthcare personnel in acute care hospitals received seasonal influenza vaccination, representing a significant increase over historical rates of compliance with vaccine recommendations [51, 52]. Successful strategies to improve compliance with vaccination policies have included education and incentive-based (i.e., reward) systems, but the most effective approaches have been mandatory vaccination policies that require the use of protective face masks or antiviral prophylaxis for the duration of the influenza season or result in the suspension or termination of unvaccinated workers [53]. Some states have enacted legislation to increase healthcare provider immunization rates [54].",

For CLABSI and CAUTI, it is recommended that insertion and maintenance bundles be measured separately. SPS recommends performing a minimum of 20 audits per month in order to obtain data frequently enough to rapidly identify barriers to compliance and to make changes in the processes to eliminate these barriers [57]. A 90% compliance rate for bundle data is a common goal within SPS. Organizations using sophisticated electronic health records (EHR) with capabilities to discretely document and subsequently retrieve data may be able to gather some or all data electronically. However, this approach may not be feasible in all settings, and direct observation of bundle elements may identify additional opportunities for improvement that may not be revealed through automated retrieval of data documented in the EHR.",

Many institutions use this approach, documented most commonly for CLABSI, to retrace every step leading up to the infection and thereby identify improvement opportunities. The goal of this approach is to allow institutions to learn from each and every infection and implement improvements based on these findings. For example, Rinke et al. used a RCA approach to systematically investigate all CLABSI in hospitalized pediatric oncology patients [59]. When a positive blood culture was reported, a multidisciplinary team interviewed care providers and analyzed 13 patient and system factors that could have contributed to the CLABSI. A similar approach was used by Bundy et al. in a multicenter quality improvement collaborative that included the implementation of a standardized bundle as well as CLABSI survellience. This approach resulted in significant reductions in CLABSI rates among 32 pediatric hematology-oncology centers [60]. In both instances, the use of this RCA approach provided vital data elements that could then be used for system changes and the implementation of improvement strategies.",

Formal SPS Prevention Bundles for CDI have not been developed, and, without this guidance, other approaches must be utilized to reduce the number of these infections. One example is the guideline provided by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA); this includes strategies for prevention of CDI in adults, but can be adapted for pediatric hematology-oncology patients [63, 64]. A list of recommendations can be found in Table 11.7. Evaluating and monitoring each of these practices can provide institutions with compliance data as well as identifying areas for improvement, much like the approaches taken using the SPS bundles.

The Quality Transformation Network, managed by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association (CHA), unified pediatric hospitals to work together in order to deliver high-quality, reliable, and safe care for pediatric patients [56]. Initial collaborative efforts to prevent HAI in children\u2019s hospitals were focused on CLABSI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The successful PICU work prompted CHA to expand these efforts to inpatient pediatric hematology-oncology units in 2009, and to the ambulatory setting in 2011, by creating the Hematology-Oncology CLABSI Collaborative, later renamed the Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders Learning Network (CCBDN) [56, 60, 65]. Recently, the CHA collaborative has worked with SPS [56]. SPS now collects data on inpatient CLABSI for pediatric oncology/hematology units, and CCBDN has concentrated efforts on reducing CLABSI in ambulatory patients with cancer and blood disorders, recognizing that the majority of these children and adolescents receive much of their care outside the hospital and that CLABSI occur more than twice as frequently in the ambulatory setting than in hospitalized children in this population [56, 65, 66].",

In the pediatric hematology-oncology population, however, care may require a central venous catheter for months to years at a time. Further, to reduce line accesses, nurses and physicians will need to work together to bundle lab draws, and nurses, pharmacists, and physicians will need to work together to switch from intravenous to oral therapy. All of this ongoing communication must occur in an environment with a positive patient safety culture that encourages team members and families to speak up to make changes for patient care.",

Participating children\u2019s hospitals across the nation were required to continuously report rates of infection and compliance with the central line care bundle [60]. The collaborative reproduced detailed data about CLABSI and bundle compliance rates for participating centers, allowing for transparency, visibility, and the ability to generate benchmarking data facilitating comparison among centers. Furthermore, the process of monitoring and reporting continued even after a reduction in CLABSI rates was observed, thus serving as a main strategy in sustaining gains. Monitoring and reporting of infection rates incentivizes adherence to best practice and, therefore, leads to sustained reductions in rates. Similarly, connecting teams at other hospitals reduces trial and error to find effective solutions. Also central to sustainability is the fact that these initiatives were expected to be long term and were built to persist until goals were achieved and quality improvement was maintained [60, 66, 67].",

This strategy encourages strict compliance with evidence-based practice, standardization, ongoing monitoring of performance, and incorporation into the daily routine, all of which are aspects central to maintaining change [60, 74]. Other strategies that have been used include the development of processes to learn from outstanding scenarios by RCA and identifying local barriers through methodology such as failure modes and effects analysis, a strategy used to prospectively identify areas of risk. One group specifically described the importance of ongoing monitoring of infection rates and the need to have a process in place to respond to unexpected changes in the face of an observed rise in CLABSI rates. Their strategies included preemptively identifying patients with CLABSI-specific risk factors, identification of variables associated with increased CLABSI rates directly from frontline staff, and the evaluation of variables associated with increased micro-system stress [76].",

The efforts of individual institutions are critical to identifying risks for infection in these populations and new strategies for infection prevention and ensuring that the organization itself maintains compliance with standards. Large-scale collaborations have provided forums for testing of new interventions; for disseminating standardized, evidence-based infection prevention methods; and for developing measurement and monitoring processes and benchmarks for improvement. Although still a relatively new effort, the systematic incorporation of quality improvement strategies has already demonstrated great promise in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infection in children and adolescents with cancer and improving disease outcomes.",
