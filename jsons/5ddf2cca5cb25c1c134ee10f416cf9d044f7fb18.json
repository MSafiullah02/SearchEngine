The value ranges from below 0.04 to above 0.30. This large variation shows that there is an obvious spatial clustering feature of natural hazards in China. Generally speaking, the high values are centered in North China and decrease toward northeast, northwest, and southeast. Ninety percent of the districts and counties with H D value greater than 20% are located in the middle latitude belt (25\u00b0-45\u00b0N). In Southwest China where the H D values are relatively low, the H D value increases in some topography-transition areas. Thus, it can be seen that natural hazards relatively cluster in natural environment transition zones, such as the middle latitude belt, sea-land transition zones, topography-transition areas, and semiarid farming-pastoral ecotone. In the transition regions of several natural environments, there exist continuous areas with high H D values.

Figure 1 .2 shows that there is a large variation in covering index of natural hazards in China, ranging from less than 0.02 to more than 11.0 and indicating obvious regional differences. On the whole, the trapezoid region with Qiqihar, Harbin, Tianshui, and Hangzhou as four vertexes has the highest H C values (>8.0) in the country. In this high-value region, the Northeast China Plain and the North China Plain have values usually greater than 9.0. The regions with H C values greater than 10 display a Lambda-shaped layout; that is, one line is Qiqihar-Tongliao-Beijing-Taiyuan-Baoji-Tianshui, and the other line stretches from southern Hebei Province to Hangzhou along the Grand Canal. The low-value regions are centered in the Northern Tibetan Plateau, from which H C value increases outwards. In regions south of the Yangtze River, there are two high-value belts: southeast coastal belt and southwestern provinces including Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan.

The relative intensities in the vast north-central Tibetan Plateau and Northwest China are relatively low. The regional differentiation of relative intensity is tightly associated with the regional distribution of several major hazards. First of all, the seismically active belts of China, i.e., the Pacific Rim belt and Himalayan seismic belt, have the correspondingly high intensities. Seismic regions, once having an earthquake with a magnitude greater than 8, usually become small high-intensity centers, such as West China, Tangshan. Secondly, the high-intensity regions are overlapped with the regions concentrated with cloudbursts. For example, the coastal typhoon belt, the northern Hebei Mountains-Taihang Mountains-Dabie Mountains cloudburst belt, and the cloudburst belts in western Sichuan and (Shi 2011) western Hunan.

As for east-west differentiation, the values of multiple degree, relative intensity, and covering index are higher in the east and lower in the west. The high values in the east are centered in North China while the low values in the west are centered in northern Tibet. As for north-south differentiation, the vast area within 25\u00b0to 45\u00b0N in the east has values of all three indexes higher than areas to its south and north. Among this vast area, the highest values exist in range of 30\u00b0to 40\u00b0N.

At present, the classification of disaster grade mainly adopts the standardized division method of disaster risk factors of each disaster, while there is no standard division for multi-hazard classification. The qualitative approach is usually used to classify disaster intensity levels, that is, the use of continuous quantitative or semiquantitative indicators, such as Applied Multi-Risk Mapping of Natural Hazards for Impact Assessment (ARMONIA) that categorizes a disaster into high, medium, or low level according to its intensity. Another example is hazard score proposed by Odeh Engineers Inc. (2001) that takes into account the level, frequency, and percentage of the affected area in the total research area.

SARS is named by World Health Organization (WHO) to describe a viral respiratory disease caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Baidu Baike 2016).In the same year, the widespread heat waves in Europe killed 70,000 lives(Robine et al. 2008).Because these large-scale or very large-scale disasters have great and wide impacts, people are becoming more and more interested in the studies of them. In 2004, OECD published a book named Large-Scale Disasters-Lessons Learned. In 2008, Cambridge University Press in UK published a book called Large-scale Disaster-Prediction, Control, Reduction compiled by Mohamed Gad-el-Hak.

And then it issued one report every year afterward. Until 2016, there have been 11 global risk reports being published. The series of reports deal with both traditional and non-traditional risks.1.3.1 Risk Classification System of Davos World Economic ForumIn early 2014, the Davos World Economic Forum published the Global Risk Report 2014, where 31 global risks are grouped into five categories(Table 1.13).

This classification system includes six categories: physical factors, chemical factors, biological factors, natural forces, social-communicative hazards, and complex hazards. Based on these general categories, there are 33 specific risks(Table 1.15). 1.14 Global risk classification system of Davos(WEF 2016)    Major natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, geomagnetic storms)Failure of state governance (e.g., failure of legal system, corruption, political impasse) Illegal trade (e.g., illegal money flows, tax evasion, trafficking, organized crime)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF19": {"text": "15 (continued)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Risk is the probability of disaster loss in a future period of time in a region, or the future disaster. Essentially, risk is the probability of occurrence of a future hazardous event and its impacts (loss and/or damage). UNISDR (2004) defines risk as the probability of harmful consequences resulting from interactions between natural or human-induced hazards and vulnerable conditions. Two aspects that need special attention are the influence of social factors on risk and the estimation of hazard intensity and distribution.Disaster risk usually refers to natural disaster or environmental risk that is associated with natural factors. The wide attention which disaster risk receives is related to the disaster (especially catastrophic disaster) insurance and the risk governance of emerging risks and very large-scale disasters.The International Risk Governance Council, founded in 2003 in Geneva, Switzerland, paid high attention to the governance of emerging risk and slow-developing catastrophic risks and also established the transition from risk management to risk governance.In 2006, Chinese National Committee for the International Human Dimensions Program on Global Environmental Change (CNC-IHDP) proposed to IHDP to undertake the Integrated Risk Governance (IRG) research under the background of global environmental change. This international scientific program proposal was approved by the scientific committee of IHDP and launched in 2010 (Shi et al. ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Risks"}]}
