By the end of March, 2020, there were more than 350000 confirmed cases in the US, distributed across more than 2000 counties. We find that the upper tail of this distribution exhibits a power law, with Pareto exponent close to one. We investigate whether a simple model of the growth of COVID-19 cases involving Gibrat's law can explain the emergence of this power law. The model is calibrated to match (i) the growth rates of confirmed cases, and (ii) the varying lengths of time during which COVID-19 had been present within each county. Thus calibrated, the model generates a power law with Pareto exponent nearly exactly equal to the exponent estimated directly from the distribution of confirmed cases across counties at the end of March.",

            "text": "A common feature of models that purport to explain the prevalence of power laws is the presence of random multiplicative growth. Loosely, the size S t of a quantity of interest at time t (e.g., wealth, population, firm size, etc.) is said to exhibit random multiplicative growth if its (random) growth factor G t+1 = S t+1 /S t is independent of the current size S t . This is known among economists as Gibrat's law of proportional growth. On its own, Gibrat's law is not sufficient to generate a power law. For instance, a geometric Brownian motion (the continuous-time analogue of a random multiplicative growth process with lognormal growth) stopped at a fixed time has a lognormal distribution, which does not exhibit a power law. On the other hand, a geometric Brownian motion stopped at an exponentially distributed time has a double Pareto distribution, which exhibits a power law in both tails [25] . We may thus expect to observe a power law in the size distribution of a population whose members have been growing like geometric Brownian motions since birth, and whose distribution of ages is exponential. The combination of Gibrat's law with an exponential age distribution as a generative mechanism for power laws has been used extensively in recent economic literature [7, 8, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] .",

As we will see, by the end of March 2020, a power law had emerged in the right tail of that distribution. We investigate whether the combination of Gibrat's law (for growth in the number of cases within a county) and a suitable age distribution (for the length of time since the outbreak in each county) can explain this power law. Using daily county-level data from the onset of COVID-19 in the US in January 2020 until the end of March 2020, we estimate the distributions of growth rates and ages, employing a gamma parametrization of the former and a truncated logistic parametrization of the latter. Our primary finding is that the Pareto exponent implied by the estimated growth rate and age distributions, which is 0.936, nearly exactly matches the Pareto exponent estimated directly from the distribution of cases across counties at the end of March, which is 0.930. This indicates that the combination of Gibrat's law with a suitable age distribution can explain the power law observed in the right tail of the distribution of COVID-19 cases across US counties.",

While there is limited empirical evidence that the age distributions of cities [40] and firms [41] may be approximately exponential, it is rarely the case that data used in economics and related fields allow a reliable estimate of the relevant age distribution. Indeed, it can be difficult to unambiguously define the age of a city, firm, or household, the latter of which is frequently interpreted as a dynastic unit spanning multiple generations. By comparison, our COVID-19 data are particularly informative about the shape of the age distribution, and our analysis appears to be the first in which a Pareto exponent is obtained from direct estimates of both the growth rate and age distributions.",

The same cannot be said for the later stages of an epidemic. In the exact analytical solution to the system (3) given in Ref. [47] , the growth rate of infections falls as the proportion of the population that is infected or recovered rises, because a smaller proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection.

At the end of that period the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US was less than 0.06% of the total population. We provide evidence in Sec.

To this end, for each day t between March 3 and March 30 inclusive, we estimate the cross-sectional regression equation (5) by ordinary least squares, where c it is the number of cases in county i up to day t, \u2206 ln c i,t+1 is the growth rate in cases in county i between day t and t + 1, D it is the number of days (inclusive) between day t and the day of the first confirmed case in county i, \u03b5 it is the regression residual, and \u03b2 0t , \u03b2 1t , \u03b2 2t , \u03b2 3t are regression coefficients that are potentially time-varying. (Here \u03b2 0t corresponds to \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 in Eq. (4) .) The estimation of Eq. Fig. 2 displays our estimates of \u03b2 0t , \u03b2 1t , \u03b2 2t , \u03b2 3t in Eq. (5) from March 3 to March 30, with accompanying 95% confidence bands. In each panel, the confidence bands narrow as we move from left to right, reflecting the fact that the regression sample size increases from 32 to 1940. The estimated parameters are quite stable over time. In panels (b)-(d), we see that the estimates of \u03b2 1t , \u03b2 2t , \u03b2 3t are close to zero. This is exactly what we would expect under Gibrat's law: the growth rate in cases between days t and t + 1 ought to be unrelated to the number of cases on day t, the growth rate in cases between days t \u2212 1 and t, and the time elapsed since the outbreak. The estimates of \u03b2 0t displayed in panel (a) indicate that the expected growth rate of cases during March was roughly stable at around 15-20% per day.",

Of those, 725 day-county pairs had a zero growth rate of cases (\u2206 ln c i,t+1 = 0), and were therefore excluded from the computation of the histogram in Fig. 3 and corresponding gamma fit. An observed growth rate could be zero because there were indeed no new cases, or because the data were not updated on a particular day. The proportion of growth rates observed to be zero is \u03c0 = 725/5687 = 0.128, which is substantial. For this reason, in the analysis in Sec.

By analogy, we may expect to see an exponential distribution of days-since-outbreak in our data if the number of counties that have reported at least one confirmed COVID-19 case is growing exponentially over time. The analogy fails because there are only 3243 counties in the US, so that exponential growth cannot be maintained. Once COVID-19 has spread to a substantial proportion of counties, the rate of growth in the number of counties reporting at least one case ought to fall, eventually vanishing as saturation is approached. Given that nearly two thirds of US counties had reported at least one con-firmed case by March 31, we would expect the number of newly infected counties to be declining by this time.
