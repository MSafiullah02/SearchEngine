Severe sepsis has a mortality of about 4.2% (2.3% in previously healthy children and 7.8% in chronically ill children). The incidence is greatest in children less than 1 year of age and contributes to 50% of the mortality in this age group. Survival from severe sepsis has improved from earlier years, attributable to the discovery that early recognition, aggressive resuscitation, and timely treatment improve outcomes in infants and children with severe sepsis.",

The etiologies of invasive childhood bacterial infections have been significantly modified by widespread immunization against Hemophilus influenza type B (Hib), as well as pneumococcal serotypes. It is convenient to classify the most common bacterial infections based on age of the child. The organisms that should be considered in the septic neonate include Group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococci, particularly coagulase negative species, are becoming an important cause of sepsis in hospitalized neonates. Of note, herpes simplex virus can cause septic shock often indistinguishable from bacterial septic shock. It is not uncommon for neonates with severe herpes infections to have a concomitant bacteremia due to Gramnegative organisms, presumably caused by bacterial translocation from the intestines. In a recent large international severe sepsis therapy trial, Staphylococcus species were the most common cause of sepsis in children. In children under 1 year of age, community-acquired organisms such as Pneumococcus and Neisseria meningitides are frequent causes of sepsis. In the developing world, these two organisms, in addition to Salmonella species and Hemophilus influenza type B, are the most frequent causes of sepsis in infants. The most frequent pathogens remain the same in healthy school-aged children. In addition, sepsis without a clearly defined focus of infection such as meningococcemia becomes more common in this age group. Disseminated staphylococcal and streptococcal infections, often associated with a source in bone, joint, lung, or heart is a frequent cause of sepsis in children over 6 years of age. The incidence of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus species has increased dramatically in developed countries.",

Early recognition of shock requires a high index of suspicion, as only subtle changes in vital signs (i.e., mild tachycardia, mild tachypnea, or slight delayed capillary refill) may be the first signs of developing septic shock. In some forms of severe sepsis and septic shock, children present with ''warm shock.'' Patients in warm shock have decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with relative hypovolemia from vasodilatation and venous pooling of blood. There is low diastolic blood pressure, and wide pulse pressure with resultant clinical findings of ''bounding pulses and warm extremities.'' Despite the potential reassurance of ''adequate pulses,'' the oxygen delivery in these patients is not adequate, thus they are in shock. Children (especially infants and neonates) will more commonly present with ''cold shock.'' These patients have elevated SVR, with a narrow pulse pressure, cool mottled extremities, and reduced peripheral pulses. There will often be tachypnea as a compensation for metabolic acidosis, which may develop into increased work of breathing if ARDS develops or there is underlying pulmonary disease. The child will frequently have fever and a ''toxic'' or ill appearance. Of note, neonates and young infants may have septic shock without fever. As shock evolves, there will start to be clinical evidence of compromised organ function with worsening tachycardia, tachypnea, decreased urine output, and altered mental status. Decrease in systolic blood pressure is a late finding in septic shock, and represents decompensated stage of shock, which can rapidly be fatal. As the child progresses to irreversible shock, severe hypotension, lethargy, and respiratory failure are late and ominous findings.",

Children in shock frequently have increased oxygen demand by the muscles of respiration as they attempt to hyperventilate to compensate for metabolic acidosis.

            "text": "As with all critically ill children, the first step of management is to support the airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Most children with septic shock will be tachypneic as compensation for their underlying metabolic acidosis, and should be given oxygen via face mask to help improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Children with septic shock can have as much as 40% of their cardiac output shunted to their respiratory muscles to support increased work of breathing. Mechanical ventilation can eliminate the excessive oxygen demand and help restore the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption by shunting cardiac output from the respiratory muscles to other vital organs. In addition, mechanical ventilation can help facilitate the use of sedation and improve fever control, which will also decrease the patient's oxygen demand and consumption. In the later stages of shock, there may be more recognized clinical indications for mechanical ventilation such as respiratory failure -in the presence of inadequate ventilation and/or oxygenation, obstructed airway, excessive work of breathing, or altered mental status, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation should be instituted. Caution should be exercised when performing endotracheal intubation in children with septic shock, as they are at risk for developing a sudden decrease in cardiac output from acute drop in preload. This may occur due to positive intrathoracic pressure caused by mechanical ventilation, inhibiting blood return back to the heart. Hypotension in this situation should be treated by aggressive fluid resuscitation (see below). The decrease in CO may also be due to the vasodilating properties of the medicines used to intubate the child with -which neutralize the compensatory endogenous vasoconstriction that is occurring in the child with septic shock. Medicines such as benzodiazepines, propofol, barbiturates, and opiates should be used with extreme caution for this reason. Some have suggested ketamine as the premedication of choice to facilitate mechanical ventilation due to its ability to release endogenous catecholamines with resultant increase in SVR and relative preservation of cardiovascular stability. Despites its ability to preserve hemodynamics, etomidate should not be used in children with septic shock because it suppresses the child's adrenal axis.",

Repeated 20 mL/kg isotonic fluid boluses should be given until these physiologic goals are met. Patients with severe septic shock will often require 60-80 mL/kg or more of isotonic fluid in the first hour of resuscitation. Ongoing capillary leak must be monitored and adequate volume should be administered to prevent further hypovolemia. Hypocalcemia and hypoglycemia should be evaluated for and corrected during the fluid resuscitation. A urinary catheter should be placed to accurately follow urine output continuously. Central venous access should be established in children who respond poorly to the first 3-4 boluses, and those with insufficient physiologic physiologic reserves at baseline. Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring may be a helpful adjunct for monitoring. The development of hepatomegaly, gallop rhythm or new crackles on auscultation, in addition to a marked increase in CVP without concomitant improvement in hemodynamics are signs of possible fluid overload denoting that more fluid is unlikely to be beneficial. Children in septic shock frequently become progressively more edematous with ongoing resuscitation due to continuing capillary leak.

Early recognition (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, abnormal white blood cell count, and presence of organ dysfunction) and immediate aggressive treatment has been shown to improve outcomes in pediatric patients with bacterial sepsis. Within the first hour of treatment, in addition to the standard ABCs of resuscitation, the child should receive up to 60 mL/kg fluid boluses and dopamine initiation if still in shock after 60 mL/kg of fluid. Blood, urine, respiratory, and other indicated cultures should be sent, and appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics should also be initiated within the first hour. Fever control and consideration of early intubation and mechanical ventilation to significantly decrease the body's oxygen demand should be given to any child in septic shock. Escalation and direction of further fluid and vasoactive medicine resuscitation is determined by repeated examination and clinical response to the first hour of therapy.",
