HSV most commonly leads to orofacial, genital, and esophageal lesions, and less commonly can lead to hepatitis, meningitis, encephalitis, bone marrow suppression, and pneumonia [22, 38, 42] . HSV pneumonia is very rare and has been reported in about 3% of the patients with hematologic malignancies and in about 5% of patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (these patients will be referred to as 'HSCT patients' in the chapter) without prophylaxis [56] . After acyclovir prophylaxis was implemented in patients with a HSCT, the incidence of HSV excretion dropped to 2.5% [49] , while HSV pneumonia has been reported in less than 1% of all pneumonias developing after HSCT [16] .",

However, newer antivirals such as valaciclovir and famciclovir are also active against HSV and have an oral bioavailability three to five times superior to that of oral acyclovir [53, 62] . Both of these agents are used to prevent HSV reactivation during induction chemotherapy for leukemia or after HSCT [49] .
