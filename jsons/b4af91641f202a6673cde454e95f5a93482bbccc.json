For countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. We are here determining whether measures of odor intensity in a large sample can serve as one such measure. Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes. Average odor intensity ratings were then compared to predicted COVID-19 population prevalence over time in the Swedish population and were found to closely track each other (r=-0.83). Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and",

In sharp contrast to the majority of western European countries, the Swedish authorities have opted to not close down the majority of society as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the Swedish authorities have, in a step-wise fashion, limited the curtailing of normal individual rights to basically four major actions: international travel ban, a ban on public gatherings of more than 50 individuals (down from an initial ban of >500 individuals); forced universities and high schools (students aged above age of 16) to switch to online teaching, and recently, a mandate that restaurants and bars offer table service only (Swedish Public Health Authority, 2020) . In addition, the Swedish Public Health Authority has recommended that individuals work from home, if possible, and has promoted the practice of physical distancing; recommendations that are largely respected. The Swedish response to the pandemic can be summarized as a tactic of step-wise implementation of measures in response to the predicted prevalence of COVID-19. This strategy as a response to a pandemic is, however, dependent on the non-trivial problem of identifying a reliable measure of COVID-19 positive individuals in the population, data of vital importance for the timing of government action to slow the spread of the disease.",

However, the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are diffuse (World Health Organization, 2020) which limits the precision of online searches. While the list of identified symptoms has evolved, several recent reports suggest that olfactory dysfunction may be a specifically salient and potentially early symptom of COVID-19 (Gane et al., 2020; Menni et al., 2020) . If so, olfactory dysfunction might be a key symptom that can potentially be used as an efficient tool to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases in a population. The reported prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in relation to COVID-19 has ranged from around 5% (Mao et al., 2020) to a full 98% (Moein et al., 2020) . Reports based on retrospective review of medical records have generally reported lower prevalence numbers, whereas the majority of publications using self-reported olfactory problems have indicated prevalence numbers around 60% (ranging from 30% to 88%) (cf. Pellegrino et al., 2020) . This large variation between studies can be attributed to both difference in how olfactory dysfunction was assessed and defined, as well as what sample (clinical or general population) was recruited to the various studies. It is not surprising then that studies only including COVID-19 patients demonstrate larger prevalence of olfactory dysfunction compared to studies with an open inclusion, irrespective of established diagnosis or type of symptoms experienced. Nonetheless, there are currently several peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed reports that consistently indicate that olfactory dysfunction is a salient symptom of COVID-19 (cf. Pellegrino et al., 2020) . Importantly, the Swedish Public Health Authority recently identified olfactory dysfunction as the most prevalent symptom in the Swedish COVID-19 population estimate. Taken together this indicates that olfactory dysfunction is a good marker for COVID-19 occurrence.",

While most people can notice sudden changes in olfactory function, awareness of an olfactory loss is still far lower than a perceptual loss in other sensory modalities, such as audition and vision. It is therefore necessary to reliably estimate olfactory loss by probing olfactory functions with actual odors. The majority of clinical tests for odor dysfunction use an easily administrated and timeefficient method of assessing an individual's ability to identify odor (Kobal et al., 1996) . However, to create odor identification tests for home use is a problematic undertaking given that the tested individual should not know which odors are included in the test, that test-retest learning is a considerable confound, and that because free odor identification is difficult even for normosmic individuals, written or verbal cues in combination with lures are needed. Together, these problems render odor identification sub-optimal as a home test. A more straightforward test might therefore be to assess odor intensities of common household odors, thereby avoiding the limitations imposed by verbalization. Indeed, using assessment of odor intensities as a measure of olfactory functions has previously been used (Stamps et al., 2013) and demonstrated to be related to odor detection thresholds of the odor in question (Kern et al., 2015) .",

This data comes from a multicenter project initiated at the Weizmann Institute of Science with the overall aim of determining the involvement of the olfactory system in the COVID-19 disease. Via an online rating tool (www.smelltracker.org), participants rate household odors for their perceived intensity and pleasantness. Specifically, we determine whether odor intensity ratings negatively follow predicted population prevalence of COVID-19 and whether odor intensity ratings are modulated by COVID-19 symptoms.

A paired two tailed Student's t-tests were used to assess odor intensity rating pre-and post-developing COVID-19 symptoms. Finally, for the test-retest reliability, we used Pearson correlation between odor intensity ratings in the first session and second session in individuals who provided data in more than 1 session and who reported no symptoms in both. All other correlation tests were done with Spearman correlation to avoid influence of skewed data.

Over the testing time, mean odor intensity ratings decline whereas the predicted COVID-19 societal levels go up ( Figure 1A) . there was a marked downward shift in ratings of odor intensity levels occurring in this sample between the 4th to 9th of April. To assess whether this function was different for odors with low and high trigeminal irritants (unisensory and bimodal odors), we assessed them separately. We found that both the unimodal odor category ( Figure 1B ) and the bimodal odor category ( Figure 1C ) had similar psychometric functions. We then assessed the statistical relationship between intensity estimates over time and population COVID-19 predictions using separate Spearman rank correlation. There was a significant negative relationship between the COVID-19 prediction model and odor intensity ratings over time, \u03c1 = -0.83, p < .001 (Supplementary Figure S1) . Similarly, there were significant relationships between the COVID-19 prediction model and both the unimodal odor category, \u03c1 = -.79, p < .003, as well as the bimodal odor category, \u03c1 = -0.83, p < .001.

This is of course a conservative measure that will bias our estimates towards a potential lower prevalence given that there might be asymptomatic COVID-19 patients or individuals with olfactory dysfunction prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying this cut-off to the group that displayed symptoms of COVID-19, 66% of these individuals had intensity estimates falling in the olfactory dysfunction category ( Figure 3A ). However, having symptoms of COVID-19 does not constitute a diagnosis meaning that odor dysfunction in the sample cannot be directly linked to confirmed COVID-19 diagnose. The national strategy of the Swedish national healthcare system has been to prioritize testing of individuals admitted to a hospital with clear signs of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This means that few individuals in our sample had been tested for COVID-19 and even fewer had a positive test. However, 16 individuals indicated that they had been confirmed as COVID-19 and among these individuals, 81% was classified in the olfactory dysfunction group ( Figure 3A) .

Intensity ratings of widely available household products via online assessment is a simple and cheap way both for the individual to obtain indication of odor dysfunction, which might indicate COVID-19 onset, and for a potential governmental or health organization to monitor spread of the disease. Participants in this study had to choose between set classes of odors, but this may not be necessary if the main aim is to determine COVID-19 spread based on intensity estimates. Intensity ratings for the odor categories containing odor sources with low trigeminal irritants and the categories containing odor sources with a bimodal sensation both closely followed the predicted COVID-19 prevalence (correlation coefficient .79 and .83, respectively) . Few household odors beyond vanillin are truly activating only the olfactory system without any trigeminal activation and attempting to only use low-trigeminal odors might lower the ease of use; therefore, a more feasible setup might be to allow free selection and instead block certain odor sources with a known high trigeminal activation. It is at the present time unclear if the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects the olfactory system, alone, or whether the trigeminal system is also influenced. The fact that bimodal odors, as well, closely track the COVID-19 spread in the population lends support to the notion that the trigeminal system may also be affected, either by the SARS-CoV-2 virus or by the reduced olfactory ability per se (Frasnelli et al., 2007) . However, although the odors listed in the bimodal odor categories are bimodal in their percept, most are not strong trigeminal irritants. Whether similar results would be obtained using stronger irritants, such as acetone etc., remains to be determined.",

At the time of the study, the Swedish health authorities prioritized testing of COVID-19 in individuals when admitted to a hospital with signs of COVID-19 and key healthcare staff.

However, the test-retest reliability of odor intensity measure, here estimated to .66, indicate that odor intensity function might not work as a reliable measure on the individual level. Indeed, other studies assessing test-retest of odor intensities have reached a near identical value (Kern et al., 2015) . Hence, to achieve a high reliability at the individual level, a more general and advanced odor test than mere intensity ratings is probably needed to have the specificity needed. At this time, it is unlikely that mere intensity estimates could serve as anything other than an indication of a potential COVID-19 diagnosis which should either trigger serum testing of COVID-19 or for healthcare workers to treat a patient as a potential COVID-19 suspect. Nonetheless, there is great potential for the development of odor tests of COVID-19 that might reach a specificity near serum tests.",

            "text": "In the general debate whether olfactory dysfunction is a sign of COVID-19, a valid counter argument has been raised; that loss of olfactory function is not uncommon for upper respiratory infections and the significantly larger prevalences of olfactory dysfunction reported for the SARS-CoV-2 virus might be explained by the increased attention to symptoms and an increase in response prevalence. Upper respiratory infections do commonly lead to a reduction of olfactory function or anosmia (total loss of olfactory functions) (Seiden, 2004) and virus infection is one of the leading causes of anosmia in patients with nonconductive olfactory disorders (Quint et al., 2001) . However, an interesting aspect of COVID-19 related olfactory dysfunction seems to be the frequent report of an isolated sudden onset in absence of other nasal problems with patients reporting a normal nasal patency (Gane et al., 2020) . The exact mechanism of this onset of olfactory dysfunction without other common symptoms associated with upper respiratory infections has yet to be determined but recent data suggest a few hypotheses. Nasal epithelial cells richly express the SARS-CoV-2 entry factor (Sungnak et al., 2020) , the ACE2 receptors, which has been linked to both the virus replication rate and disease severity (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) {ref}. Based on this, it can be speculated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus damage the olfactory epithelium to such extent that olfactory ability is degraded. Many viruses, including corona viruses, can also propagate via the olfactory nerve and thereby infect and damage the olfactory bulb (Schwob et al., 2001; Wheeler et al., 2017) . Corona virus RNA has been found in olfactory areas of the brain , and recent data suggests that some COVID-19 patients display neurological symptoms (Mao et al., 2020) . Moreover, it is possible that nasal blockage occur but so high up in the nasal cavity that the blockage only affects access to the olfactory epithelium without impeding nasal patency (Trotier et al., 2007) . Future studies are needed to isolate the exact mechanisms.",
