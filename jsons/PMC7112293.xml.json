In susceptible individuals, this inflammation causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, particularly at night and/or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment. The inflammation also causes an associated increase in the existing bronchial hyperresponsiveness to a variety of stimuli.",

Bronchial smooth muscle spasm probably is instrumental in this excessive reactivity, but there are many factors in the airway that regulate or contribute to airway smooth muscle tone. For example, the airway contains a number of resident cells (mast cells, alveolar macrophages, airway epithelium and endothelium) as well as immigrating inflammatory cells (eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and, possibly, platelets). These cells are capable of secreting a variety of mediators, such as histamine, the cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4), prostaglandin D2, and platelet-activating factor, which can directly contract the bronchial smooth muscle. In addition, the recruited cells can generate inflammatory mediators, which cause the airway smooth muscle to become more contractible to bronchospasm mediators.",

Thus, the shift or transition to remodeling from allergic inflammation suggests a new family of mediators with actions on smooth muscle growth, collagen deposition, blood vessel proliferation, and mucous gland hyperplasia. Collectively, these new data provide a picture of asthma that begins with an acute cellular inflammatory response that may then evolve into a more chronic process in which structural changes occur in the airway to further affect airway hyperresponsiveness and airflow obstruction.7\n",

Airway hyperresponsiveness, if demonstrable during infancy and early childhood, may be a risk factor for the subsequent development of clinical asthma.9 Although airway inflammation contributes to this physiologic aberration in asthma, multiple other factors that influence airway caliber play a role as well.10 It is important to emphasize that airway hyperresponsiveness is not unique to asthma. A positive methacholine challenge test is diagnostic for airway hyperresponsiveness (which can be seen in atopics, patients with cystic fibrosis, and other chronic lung diseases and even in normal individuals for a few weeks after a viral respiratory tract infection), not asthma per se. The potential usefulness of this test is if it is negative (eg, in the evaluation of chronic cough), since it is unusual for a patient with clinical asthma to have a level of airway responsiveness that would fall into the normal range.",

Once established in genetically predisposed individuals, IgE-mediated reactions are a major contributor both to acute asthmatic symptoms and chronic airway inflammation. Chronic low-level exposure to indoor allergens and dust mite and cockroach in particular may play a major role in both asthma pathogenesis and subsequent provocation of symptoms.17 Although a wide variety of inhaled allergens can provoke asthma symptoms, sensitization to house dust mite,18 cockroach,19\nAlternaria,\n20 and, possibly, cat21 are important in the pathogenesis of asthma. Paradoxically, recent data would suggest that exposure to cats or dogs during early life may actually protect against the development of asthma.22 The features of these allergens to the development of asthma are not fully established but may relate to their enzymatic as well as antigenic activity.23\nAlternaria exposure, in particular, may produce severe acute asthmatic symptoms, as sensitivity to Alternaria has been implicated as a risk factor for sudden respiratory arrest in adolescents and young adults with asthma.24 Although food allergy may produce bronchospasm along with skin and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, it is very unusual for food allergy to produce an isolated respiratory reaction.25\n",

This response is transient, peaks midexercise, and returns to baseline at the end of exercise. Progressive bronchospasm then ensues, with maximal obstruction occurring 5 to 10 minutes after the cessation of exercise. Spontaneous remission usually follows, such that pulmonary function returns to baseline within 30 to 60 minutes. Under most circumstances, the degree of bronchoconstriction is rarely severe enough to be life-threatening, and such a situation almost invariably reflects advanced untreated disease or confounding triggering factors (ie, concomitant allergen or irritant exposure), or both.

Demonstration of the extent of reversibility often requires the administration of corticosteroids. Other abnormalities in lung volumes include a decreased vital capacity and an increase in functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, and residual volume (up to 300% to 600% of predicted normal value during an acute attack).

The consensus opinion was that current evidence neither supports nor refutes the benefits of written action plans based on PEF monitoring compared with symptom-based plans in improving health care utilization, symptoms, or lung function.

The most commonly employed methods used to evaluate airway hyperresponsiveness include inhalation provocation with methacholine (direct stimuli) and exercise challenge (indirect stimuli). Direct stimuli act upon the relevant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle stimulating airway muscle contraction directly. Indirect stimuli result in airway smooth muscle contraction through one or more intermediate mechanisms, including local or central neuronal reflexes, activation of resident (eg, mast cells through non-IgE-dependent mediator release) or inflammatory cells, or others.8 Bronchoprovocation studies with methacholine are more sensitive but less specific than is exercise challenge for diagnosing asthma.

If none of these criteria are present, the chance of a child having asthma at this age is <5%. Current clinical trials are being performed to determine if children with positive asthma risk indexes who are identified and treated in early childhood can have the incidence of development of asthma reduced and/or the decrease in lung function prevented.",

In some patients, the clinical picture can be further complicated if VCD and asthma coexist. The two other common causes of chronic obstructive lung disease in adults, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, can be differentiated from asthma on the basis of abnormal diffusing capacities in emphysema, cough and sputum production in chronic bronchitis, and a smoking history in both. It should be noted that asthma may coexist with both of these conditions, making the finding of reversibility challenging to interpret in some cases.",

Glucocorticoids produce their effect on various cells by binding to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which go on to regulate transcription of certain target genes. Steroid-bound GR form dimers that bind to DNA glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), resulting in increased transcription, an increase in mRNA, and increased synthesis of proteins. However, in asthma, it is more likely that control of inflammation comes from repression of gene transcription.",

First, to gain control of the underlying disease process, or to achieve a state of disease remission (eg, in status asthmaticus, or in patients with chronic stable asthma who have had significant diminutions in lung function over more prolonged time periods). Second, to maintain this control (remission) for as long as possible with the least amount of side effects. These initial actions usually require high-dose ICS or, more frequently, systemic corticosteroids. Remittive therapy usually requires an oral corticosteroid burst [eg, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg per day prednisone for 5 days (usual adult maximum is 40 to 60 mg/d)]. The duration of the burst will vary considerably among patients, but the goal should be to maximize lung function, minimize symptoms, and reduce the use of rescue medications. At the same time, an ICS medication should be started at doses sufficient to maintain the initial remission for prolonged periods of time. The dose and type of medication may be influenced by age (delivery systems, side effects), cost, and the familiarity of the clinician with the nuances of the various available products. It should be emphasized that the abrupt discontinuation of ICS is an important cause of asthma exacerbations.",
