            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and devastating complication after acute illness or injury, and it results in high morbidity, mortality, and health care costs [1]. Despite use of lung-protective ventilation, overall ICU and hospital mortality of ARDS patients is still higher than 40% [2]. In addition to sepsis, trauma and pneumonia, a large epidemiologic study suggested the relationship with evidence of a dose\u2013response effect between cigarette smoking and ARDS [3], including approximately 50% of ARDS cases associated with cigarette smoking [4]. Smoke is a complex and harmful substance comprising a variety of noxious gases, irritants and asphyxiants [5]. Numerous investigations have been conducted and found that smoke may directly or indirectly damage lung endothelia and alveolar epithelia and lead to the change of pulmonary hemodynamics. The possible mechanism maybe associated with large inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and platelets,and proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, proteases, oxidants neuromediator, cyclooxygenase and procoagulantfactors [6]. However, large-scale trials on ARDS have not found effective pharmacologic therapy for improving the clinical outcome.",

            "text": "The renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance [7]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain. ACE activity triggers vasoconstriction by generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, while ACE2 counterbalances with ACE and functions as a negative regulator of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) [8]. Previous reports indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Researches showed that ACE2 knock-out mice could be protected from SARS infection [9]. Besides, researches in acid-aspiration-induced ARDS, endotoxin-induced ARDS and peritoneal sepsis-induced ARDS showed that ACE, angiotensin (Ang) II type I (AT 1) receptor, acts as lung injury-prompting factor, whereas ACE2 protects against that kind of lung injury [10], [11]. Recent report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model [12]. These findings suggested that RAS may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and might facilitate the development of a novel drug target for ARDS.",

There were 6 rats in each group. Smoke inhalation induced lung injury models were built according to the method described by Zhu et al. [13]. Briefly, 150 g of dry wood shavings and 30 ml of kerosene were mixed thoroughly in a pot. This material was then heated to produce smoke. Using an air blower, the smoke was wafted from the pot to a 20 cm \u00d7 20 cm \u00d7 20 cm holding cage. This cage was kept at a temperature of 35 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C and was equipped with transparent glass on the top with a light/(bulb) in each of the four corners. The transparent glass provided visibility for the determination of the optimum smoke density, which, for the purposes of this experiment, was characterized as the point at which the holding cage was full of white smoke that was thick enough to blur the bottom of the holding cage. After the cage was filled with smoke, 24 rats were placed in the holder for 10 min, and subsequently taken out of the holder for 5 min. This cycle was repeated three times. Animals were given a daily dose of buprenorphene (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) for analgesia starting immediately after the injury. The rats were anesthetized with 25 mg/kg of 1% pentobarbital by intraperitoneal injection and were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the end of the experimental time period.",

The first hour group rats showed mild edema, moderate neutrophil infiltration and mild hemorrhage. The 4th hour group rats displayed mild edema, moderate neutrophil infiltration, moderate hemorrhage and mild bronchiole epithelial desquamation.

Exposure to wood smoke, which is composed primarily of aldehydes in general and aldehyde C in particular, causes protein denaturation in airway mucosa, induces inflammation, injures cilia, reduces the vitality of alveolar macrophages, and damages alveolar capillary membranes to increase permeability, leading to pulmonary edema. In the current research, we successfully established smoke-induced acute respiratory distress in adult rats as evidenced by the clinical symptoms and signs, significant changes in arterial blood gases, the remarkable increase of W/D ratio, protein content and leukocytes count in BALF. There is a wide range in the type and severity of lung injury due to the different source of smoke and duration of exposure. In order to evaluate the initial and dynamic inflammatory mechanism in the acute stage, we examined the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in BALF. The results showed that cytokine-mediated inflammatory cascade was likely to play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS [16]. Moreover, the degree of inflammation gradually exacerbated at different time points in the first 24 h. Based on those findings, we assumed that the phenotypes of lung injury in smoke inhalation were partly related to the accumulation of inflammatory factor [17].",

The enzyme of ACE2 Exhibits 42% sequence identity and 61% sequence similarity to ACE. Like ACE, ACE2 is membrane-bound, but it is a monocarboxypeptidase that generates Ang (1-9) from the decapeptide Ang I and generates Ang (1-7) from AngII[20]. ACE2 plays dual roles by both degrading the vasoconstrictor Ang II and producing the vasodilator Ang (1-7) [25]. Moreover, Su et al.

Idell et al. [29] found that ARDS patients had elevated ACE levels in bronchoalveolar lavage. Orfanos [30] have also reported that the pulmonary capillary endothelium-bound ACE activity correlated with the severity of lung injury in the patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recent retrospective epidemiological studies demonstrated that pretreatment of an ACE inhibitor was associated with decreased mortality in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [31]. Besides, Imail et al. [11] have investigated the role of ACE2 in ARDS using ace2 knockout mice. Loss of ACE2 expression in mutant mice also resulted in enhanced vascular permeability, increased lung edema, accumulation of neutrophil, and worsened lung function. The negative regulation of Ang II levels by ACE2 accounts, in part, for the protective function of ACE2 in ARDS. Additionally, there were large differences in plasma ACE concentrations between individuals but are similar concentrations within families [32], which suggested the genetic susceptibility of ACE to ARDS.",

The fact that ACE increased immediately evidenced by the ACE levels in the lungs of rats sacrificed 1 h after smoke inhalation injury. ACE2 increased notably in the lungs of rats 1\u20134 h after smoke inhalation injury. The levels of ACE and ACE2 remained high for the remainder of our observed time. We concluded that the lung RAS participated in this injury process. From these results, we also concluded that, because of the noxious substances that were inhaled, the lung injury became much more severe with the time, and then ACE in the lung was generated and delivered to the periphery unceasingly, which would provoke a gradual increase in the Ang II in the lung. Ang II accumulation in the pulmonary capillary wall plays an important dual role in hemodynamics and unhemodynamics. In hemodynamics, up regulated Ang II may cause pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary arterial pressure upgrading, and the increase of pneumoangiogram permeability. In Ang II unhemodynamics, in addition to taking part in the extracellular constituent accumulating in the local lung, Ang II may promote the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and encourage transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) secretion, leading to more severe lung injury and the formation of pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis. In order to improve these reactions, the body increases the levels of ACE2 and vasodilating Ang (1\u20137) to restrain Ang II action in vivo. The ACE level is proportional to the amount of tissue Ang II available, and ACE2 may counterbalance the Ang II-promoting effects of ACE in tissue.",
