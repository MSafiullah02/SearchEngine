In [3] the authors analysed the temporal dynamics of the disease in China, Italy and France in the period between 22nd of January and 15 th of March 2020. In [4] , the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan is assessed based on the estimations of how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. The difficulty related to the accurate predictions of the pandemic is discussed in [5] . In [6] , the authors used phenomenological models valid during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province and for the overall trajectory in China [7] . Epidemic analysis of the disease in Italy is presented in [8] by means of dynamical modelling [9] . Forecasting Covid-19 is investigated in [10] . In addition, the change in the epidemic behaviour of various countries can be traced by the use of data driven systems [11] .",

It should also be kept in mind that containment measures provide a temporary control of the spread of the epidemic, just to the point of reducing the burden of the epidemic to a manageable size.

It has been reported that the virus was found without any symptoms being shown (asymptomatic infections) or before symptoms developed (pre-symptomatic infections) with SARS-Cov-2, though the role they may play in transmission remains unknown.

In the literature on the analysis of historical epidemics, fatality reports are usually the only available data, hence models are necessarily based on the assumption that cumulative fatalities represent cumulative number of removed individuals. For the Covid-19 pandemic, as daily fatality and infectious case reports are available, further evaluation of the representation of R(t) in terms of fatality data is presented. Daily infections and total fatalities are displayed on Figure 3 , for all countries. From these graphs, it is difficult to see whether the relation ' = is satisfied or not. For this, first, daily fatalities as representatives of the derivatives of R(t) will be compared with daily infectious cases as representatives of I(t) on Figures 4-6.

For South Korea, the minima of the error in R 0 seems to be located beyond R 0 =8, and the minimal error in T corresponds to T=25 approximately. These parameter values are not in the ranges reported in the literature. Furthermore, these values are not stable under the variation of the last day of the analysis. It is therefore concluded that the data for South Korea shows completely different characteristic that might be explained by the fact that approximately 27.4 percent of the confirmed coronavirus patients in South Korea were in their 20s. For all of the remaining countries, the ranges of R 0 and T corresponding minimal modelling errors are too large to attempt any reasonable estimation for these parameters.",

These parameters include the basic reproduction number, mean duration of infectious period, the time at which the number of infectious cases reaches its maximum, the time at which the rate of increase in the number of infectious cases reaches its maximum, the time at which the rate of decrease in the number of infectious cases reaches its maximum. For each country, the best Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models fitting cumulative case data are obtained. A wide variety of intervals with different scales of the parameters, basic reproduction number R 0 and infectious period T, are observed. More specifically, the basic reproduction number and mean duration of infectious period are estimated only for China since the spread of the disease there is over. These parameters are found to be 3 and 5, respectively. The fact that the median incubation and infection periods are approximately 5 days, supports the observations for R 0 and T. However, the basic reproduction number and infectious period for other countries cannot be predicted from the normalized data but the timing of key events can be estimated quite reliably. To summarize, we show that the quantity that can be the most robustly estimated from the normalized data, is the timing of the highest rate of increase in the number of infections, i.e, the inflection point of the number of infected individuals. However, it should be pointed out that the analysis performed by the SIR model for South Korea provides dissimilar results which can be explained by the unique age distribution nature of the confirmed cases.",
