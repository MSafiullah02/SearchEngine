Many studies have attmpted to identify single clinical, radiologic, or laboratory abnormalities that would distinguish Legionnaires' disease from other atypical and typical causes of CAP. Such attempts have failed largely because isolated findings are nonspecific. Many studies have compared a fever level (eg, >101\u00b0F) without taking into account the degree and duration of the fever. As expected, the degree and duration of the fever would vary considerably by pathogen, medications, and cardiopulmonary status. The maximum degree of the temperature, for example, is of some value in differentiating M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae.\n8, 9, 10\n",

Relative bradycardia is determined by noting a significant discrepancy between the pulse rate and the temperature from what would be expected for any degree of temperature. Physiologically, for each degree of temperature elevation (Fahrenheit) there is a commensurate increase of 10 beats/min in the pulse rate. For example, in a patient with a 104\u00b0F fever, the appropriate pulse response should be 130 beats/min. If the pulse response is considerably less than this (ie, <120 beats/min), then relative bradycardia is present.7, 11\n",

The presence or absence of relative bradycardia can be a critical diagnostic finding in CAP. None of the typical bacterial causes of CAP are associated with relative bradycardia. Among the atypical CAP pathogens, only Q fever, psittacosis, and Legionnaires' disease are associated with relative bradycardia. Because relative bradycardia is a cardinal sign of Legionnaires' disease, studies that do not include pulse and temperature relationships have overlooked an important sign that differentiates Legionella from other non-zoonotic atypical CAPs. Zoonotic atypical pathogens associated with relative bradycardia (eg, psittacosis and Q fever) can readily be eliminated from the differential diagnosis in patients with atypical CAPs on the basis of a negative epidemiologic contact history.6, 7, 11\n",

However, Legionella CAP typically presents with rapidly progressive and asymmetric infiltrates on the chest x-ray. The behavior of the infiltrates on the chest x-ray in Legionnaires' disease, rather than their appearance and location or associated findings (ie, cavitation, pleural effusion), should suggest the possibility of Legionella CAP.6, 7\n",

Studies comparing clinical signs and symptoms in Legionnaires' disease versus other CAPs have found no single parameter that clearly identifies Legionella CAP.8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Both Legionella and M. pneumoniae, for example, often present with loose stools and watery diarrhea. Other causes of CAP are not associated with these findings, but gastrointestinal manifestations are not always present in all cases of Legionella or mycoplasma CAP. Other clinical parameters, such as shortness of breath and respiratory rate, are nonspecific and have little differential diagnostic value in CAP. The same approach of trying to identify individual markers has been applied to laboratory abnormalities in CAPs. For example, although hyponatremia is the most commonly recognized laboratory abnormality in Legionella CAP, hyponatremia is nonetheless not specific. It is true that if present, the degree of hyponatremia is likely to be greater in Legionella than in other causes of CAP. Because pneumonia may be associated with hyponatremia, per se, it is not specific for Legionella in patients with CAP.6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n",

These laboratory abnormalities have diagnostic significance in patients with CAP and extrapulmonary findings with a negative zoonotic contact history if they are otherwise unexplained and temporarily related to the pneumonia. By combining select clinical features with laboratory abnormalities, diagnostic specificity is increased. Diagnostic specificity may be further enhanced by using a weighted point scoring system. It is important to realize that the diagnostic specificity of clinical and laboratory findings varies considerably. In view of the relative diagnostic value of clinical and laboratory findings, by using the weighted point score system and taking into account the diagnostic significance of each clinical and laboratory abnormality, the diagnostic specificity of the clinical syndromic approach can be greatly enhanced. The weighted point system is based on the relative diagnostic importance of various clinical and laboratory findings and was first developed by the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division.

Relative bradycardia occurs with any Legionella species.

In patients with CAP, although loose stools and diarrhea limit the diagnostic possibilities in M. pneumoniae or Legionella, abdominal pain with or without diarrhea is highly indicative of Legionnaires' disease.6, 7, 18, 19\n",

In my experience, patients with Legionnaires' disease have serum ferritin levels > 2 \u00d7 n ng/mL. Before ascribing an increase in ferritin levels to Legionnaires' disease, other causes of increased serum ferritin levels should be excluded (eg, myeloproliferative, neoplastic, and rheumatic disorders) in patients with CAP. However, otherwise unexplained highly elevated serum ferritin levels > 2 \u00d7 n point to the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease. Serum ferritin levels, as with hypophosphatemia, should be obtained on admission and obtained serially. Serum ferritin levels optimally should be obtained on admission. Elevations of serum ferritin levels are more sustained than low serum phosphorus levels and remain elevated for several days before decreasing.21\n",
