From 1 August 2003 swabs, ampoules of sterile water, utensils for the preparation of a controlled drug (spoons, bowls, cups, dishes), citric acid, and filters could also be provided to drug users. This change in the law was recommended by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and put out to consultation in November 2002. The aim of this change in the law is to encourage and support the adoption of more hygienic injecting practices among those drug users who continue to inject. This public health measure should therefore lead to improvements in the provision of harm reduction for injecting drug users, particularly through the further development of needle exchange programmes.",

By pooling expertise around Europe it is hoped to provide authoritative scientific advice on serious health threats, recommend control measures, allow quick mobilization of intervention teams and thus allow a rapid and effective EU-wide response. The Regulation establishing the Centre will have to be agreed by the European Parliament and Council under the codecision procedure. Only when the Regulation is finally adopted can work start on creating a management board, appointing the director and recruiting staff. The Commission is aiming to have the ECDC start work in 2005.",

These MRSA isolates were heterogeneously resistant to oxacillin/ methicillin. They could appear mastalex negative but became positive after induction with cefoxitin. They had an unusual antibiogram, being also resistant to fusidic acid, but sensitive to ciprofloxacin. 11 Twenty-two outbreaks of Salmonella enteritidis were reported to the Health Protection Agency Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) from 1 June to 27 August 2003, compared with 14 in the same period in 2002. 12, 13 A variety of S. enteritidis phage types (PT) were involved: PT 1 resistant to nalidixic acid and with low-level susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (Nx, Cp L ) three outbreaks; PT 1e one outbreak; PT3 (Nx, Cp L ) one outbreak; PT4 three outbreaks; PT6 three outbreaks; PT6a one outbreak; PT6a (Nx, CpL) one outbreak; PT8 two outbreaks; PT12 one outbreak; PT14b one national outbreak including three local outbreaks; PT21 (Nx, Cp L ) one outbreak; PT24 resistant to tetracycline (T) one outbreak; PT53 one outbreak; PT56 one outbreak. A national outbreak of S. enteritidis PT 14b sensitive to antibiotics in England and Wales in the autumn of 2002 was linked to the consumption of bakery products made with imported shell eggs. 14 During a 3 week period from 18 May, 129 cases of S. enteritidis PT 56 were reported in the Northeast of England, associated with eating in a Chinese restaurant in the North of England. 15 The buffet-style restaurant served over 2000 meals each week. Eleven cases were admitted to hospital. This was the first outbreak of S. enteritidis PT56 infection since the phage type was first identified by the Health Protection Agency Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP) in autumn 2002.",

The ship visited Iceland, Greenland and northern parts of Great Britain before returning to Germany, where all passengers disembarked. One case was confirmed by culture of the organism and the others by urinary antigen detection. The ship was berthed for 1 week at Harwich, England, where it underwent extensive environmental investigations and implementation of control measures. The ship left for Dover on 30 August after all the control measures had been reviewed by marine, port health and health protection agency staff. Passengers associated with the cruise outbreak were followed up in Germany to assist with identification of the source of infection and to assess the full extent of associated illness. An epidemic strain of Acinetobacter baumannii was identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). 26 The first isolates received by the Laboratory of Healthcare Associated Infection (LHCAI) dated back to spring 2000; since that time the department received more than 370 isolates with similar PFGE profiles, from 310 patients, from 24 hospitals. Although there was a typical PFGE profile for this strain, which was seen in isolates from 14 hospitals and persisted throughout the 3 year period, the group also included a number of variants with similar PFGE profiles. The hospitals were predominantly in the London area, but also included other hospitals in the South East region, two in the South West (Bristol) and one in the Midlands. On the basis of isolates received by LHCAI, this strain appears to have become endemic in some hospitals, whereas only small numbers of patients have been involved in others. The majority of isolates were from patients in intensive care, intensive therapy and high dependency units. During 2002, this strain accounted for more than half (approximately 52 per cent) of the total number of Acinetobacter isolates received by LHCAI for typing.",

A new development was the recognition in the USA of a small number of WNV infections following blood transfusion and transplantation 36, 37, 39 and also breastfeeding, transplacental transmission and occupational exposure. 39 As of 9 July 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that WNV activity had occurred in mosquitoes, birds or mammals in 28 states, and two confirmed human cases: one in each of South Carolina and Texas. Regularly updated information on WNV activity in the USA is available on the CDC website. 31 On 5 July 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) removed Taiwan from its list of areas with recent local transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 38 This event marked the passing of 20 days (two incubation periods) from detection and isolation of the last reported probable case and meant that all known chains of person-to-person transmission of the SARS coronavirus were broken. The total number of reported probable cases on 9 July stood at 8436, with 812 deaths. The WHO subsequently announced on 10 September that Singapore had a single, isolated laboratory-confirmed case of SARS coronavirus (CoV) infection. 38, 39 The case was a 27-year-old postgraduate medical student who worked in a virology laboratory in Singapore. He was hospitalized and isolated, and subsequently fully recovered. No secondary cases have been identified arising from this infection. The case is therefore not regarded as a public health concern.",

The vaccine was initially in short supply so the age groups at the highest risk (infants and 15-17-year-olds) were offered the vaccine first, before the winter peak in disease incidence. The campaign was rolled out as vaccine supply increased and was completed in December 2000. The vaccine was well accepted and high coverage was attained. 52 The impact of the vaccine programme over the first winter season following vaccine introduction (1999) (2000) Figure 2 ). Although the extension of the catch-up campaign may have provided some direct protection, vaccine coverage in adults is unknown and unlikely to be high. The MenC vaccine campaign has been shown to reduce the prevalence of serogroup C carriage 54 thereby generating herd immunity effects. 53 It is likely that adults, as well as unvaccinated children, are benefiting from reduced transmission of serogroup C organisms as a result of vaccination in younger age groups.",

The incidence of serogroup B disease has since declined, with only 1213 laboratory confirmed cases identified in 2002-2003. There are no immediate prospects for a serogroup B vaccine (although several candidate vaccines are currently being developed) so it is to be hoped that this natural decline in disease incidence continues.",

National incident surveillance has allowed the most common chemicals involved to be identified and this information has been used to prioritize preparation of chemical advisory information and research.

Cases were among those who have had unprotected oral or vaginal sex with casual partners or strangers, and people buying or selling sex. Of 73 cases diagnosed between July 2002 and May 2003, 17 cases had documented links with the commercial sex industry. Twenty cases admitted to unprotected oral sex and 48 cases to unprotected vaginal sex. An incident control team was set up in South London involving public health and genitourinary medicine (GUM) healthcare professionals. Other planned initiatives include the appointment of a specialist health advisor and the piloting of a new test to facilitate case finding. The increase in heterosexual syphilis was an important reminder that the rise in syphilis infection is not confined to men who have sex with men.",

Diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) rose by 5 per cent between 2001 and 2002, whereas workload (that is, other sexual health services provided by GUM clinics) increased by 23 per cent. Within the overall increase in attendances there were marked differences in the changes in diagnoses of STIs. Diagnoses of syphilis increased substantially by 67 per cent and 33 per cent in males and females, respectively, and there was a 68 per cent increase in diagnoses made in men who have sex with men (MSM). Diagnoses of gonorrhoea increased by 8 per cent in males and 10 per cent in females, but decreased by 5 per cent in MSM. Genital chlamydial infection is the most commonly diagnosed STI seen in GUM clinics with a total of 81 680 diagnoses made in 2002, a 14 per cent increase on 2001. Diagnoses of genital herpes simplex virus infection increased by only 1 per cent in males and 4 per cent in females between 2001 and 2002, a slight overall increase similar to trends over recent years. Regarding HIV, data from the survey of prevalent diagnosed HIV infection (SOPHID) in August showed a 20 per cent increase in the number of individuals seen for HIV-related care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. 25 A total of 30 281 individuals were seen in 2002, compared with 25 203 in 2001.The SOPHID survey began in 1995 and continues to provide an estimate of the numbers of individuals living with diagnosed HIV. Information is used in the planning and financing of HIV care services, and in health promotion, at both the local and national level.

Using the screening method, overall vaccine efficacy has been estimated to be 94 per cent (86-97 per cent). 53 The number of cases in adults continued to rise in 20-24-year-olds after the introduction of the vaccine campaign in the younger ages, resulting in the extension of the catch-up campaign to all those under 25 years of age in January 2001.
