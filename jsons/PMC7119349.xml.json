Emergency nurses can also gain current and accurate information about how to safely triage and screen patients for EVD, manage their care, and select and utilize PPE by accessing the ENA Ebola resource page located at http://www.ena.org/about/media/ebola/Pages/default.aspx.",

In a study by Nichol et al,7 it was found that fewer than half of the nurses involved in the study met adherence standards for the recommended use of PPE. This finding is also supported by a literature review conducted by Gammon et al,8 who found that compliance with infection control precautions is unacceptably low among health care providers. In addition, Nichols et al7 found that emergency nurses were 60% less likely to report adherence with infection control procedures than were critical care nurses.7 This finding is supported by an observational study by Creedon et al,9 who found that compliance with hand washing was lower in the emergency setting than in other areas of the hospital. Known barriers to achieving optimal compliance include lack of training, time constraints, and lack of readily available PPE.7, 8 Emergency nurses and organizational leadership should explore ways to improve adherence to infection control procedures in the emergency setting. Considering that the total number of infectious illness outbreaks have been increasing since 1980,10 and with the recent emergence of infectious illnesses in the United States, including EVD and enterovirus D68, the need for strict adherence to infection control protocols cannot be overstated.",

Historically, this part of the PPE sequence may not have been emphasized in the training process, but recent cases of the acquisition of EVD by nurses have demonstrated that doffing PPE is a high-risk period that requires careful attention to detail, monitoring by a trained observer, and a designated space for equipment removal.11\n",

Shenal et al15 also found that health care workers experienced increasing discomfort when wearing respiratory protection over a prolonged period. When health care providers are wearing PAPRs and full-body coverage, especially when they are engaged in complex patient care activities, the period in PPE that is tolerable may be even shorter. Planning should be in place to ensure that health care providers have adequate periods of rest without wearing PPE. In complex care situations, such as the care of a patient with EVD, providers may require extended rest periods to prevent heat stress, fatigue, and dehydration.",

To minimize the risk of injury, first responders are advised to obtain baseline vital signs and weight prior to donning equipment and after doffing equipment, hydrate before and after using PPE, monitor total time in PPE, and minimize time in PPE when possible (especially when wearing the highest levels of protection).18 Given the similarities in PPE that are recommended for the care of patients with EVD and the types of PPE used during chemical and biological hazards, it may be prudent to integrate these safety measures into organizational policies and procedures for the use of PAPRs in the care of patients with EVD. This step would require additional staff to assess providers before and after use of PPE; however, the \u201ctrained observer\u201d recommended by the CDC could be used in this capacity.",

Although this type of training is important, emergency nurses should also advocate for regular hands-on training with PPE to ensure competency with equipment and supplies available in their work setting. Emergency nurses should ensure that they have been fit tested for an N95 respirator and know the appropriate size to use when providing patient care.
