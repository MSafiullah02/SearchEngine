Using daily data for the period January 21 -March 13, 2020, our Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model shows that the new infection cases reported at global level, and the death ratio, have no significant effect on the US EPU, whereas the oil price negative dynamics leads to increased uncertainty. However, analyzing the situation outside China, we discover that both new case announcements and the COVID-19 associated death ratio have a positive influence on the US EPU.",

Originating in China (Hubei region), the COVID-19 affected over the last two months over 100,000 people and more than 100 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO), which daily monitors the COVID-19 figures since January 21, 2020, declared the coronavirus a pandemic. Although the spread of the virus started to decline, after the middle of February in China, the infection cases grew exponentially outside China. The European countries, but also the United States (US), are now severely touched. On the on hand, the COVID-19 triggers fear and anxiety in the society, nourished both by the daily reported new infection cases and by the increasing fatality ratio. On the other hand, the virus starts to affect the real economy, generating a crash on financial and commodity markets.",

Nevertheless, the COVID-19 numbers triggered a strong reaction of US financial markets, first on February 28, 2020, and second, on March 13, 2020, immediately after Mr. Trump declaration according to which the coronavirus represents a \"national emergency\" issue. In addition, in the context of the coronavirus crisis, the Saudi Arabia decided to flood the market with oil and the international prices dropped over 20% on March 9, 2020. Against this background, we may ask if the coronavirus crisis influences the policy-induced economic uncertainty in the US. We tempt to respond to this question by analyzing the impact of new infection case announcements, and COVID-19 death-associated ratio, on the US economic policy uncertainty (EPU). We use daily data over the period January 21 -March 13, 2020, resorting to the WHO situation reports. We also test the impact of crude oil prices on the US EPU. Given that the US is an oil-dependent country, as one of the world largest producers, it is expected that a crash of crude oil price will amplify the economic uncertainty.",

(2020) show that the impact of oil price shocks on EPU is positive at all frequencies, a result in line with Kang et al. (2017) , but contrasting that reported by Antonakakis et al. (2014) . At the same time, Ma et al. (2018) notice that EPU is important to forecast oil futures prices, whereas Aloui et al. (2016) show that EPU influences the oil price returns only in certain periods. Nevertheless, none of these studies focuses on the recent situation generated by the COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, we fill in this gap and test the impact of coronavirus numbers and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices on the US EPU (we use BRENT crude for robustness purpose). As far as we know, this is the first paper addressing the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the US policy-induced economic uncertainty.",

However, the situation is different for Model 2, where the new infection cases reported outside China increase the uncertainty. At the same time, Model 4 shows that an increase of 1% in the logarithmic level of the death ratio recorded outside China, leads to an increase of 0.18% of the uncertainty index in the long run. This result remains robust when we use the BRENT crude as a proxy for the international oil prices. 3",
