ADEM is considered a rare autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), traditionally characterized by a monophasic course. The term ADEM encompasses postinfectious, postvaccination, and idiopathic encephalomyelitis [1]. The majority of subjects report recent infections (generally nonspecific upper respiratory tract and flu-like syndromes) or active immunization several weeks before disease onset. Typically, ADEM manifests an acute onset, with nonspecific symptoms, such as headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting with or without altered mental status. In some cases, the presentation may be severe and dramatic, requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Despite the clinical severity, the long-term prognosis is generally favorable and with complete recovery in the majority of patients.",

In addition, similarly to multiple sclerosis (MS), ADEM incidence seems to be influenced by latitude, as in the United States, where it is higher in the North than in the South, increasing with the distance from the equator [7]. Epidemiological data of adult ADEM have been reported only in a few studies, due to the variability of age at presentation.",

However, the prevailing theory suggests that it is an autoimmune disorder of the CNS, triggered by an environmental stimulus in genetically susceptible individuals. Molecular sequencing has revealed that viral or bacterial microorganisms may share antigenic determinants with myelin autoantigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein (MOBP), oligodendrocyte-specific protein (OSP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and proteolipid protein (PLP). The hypothesis of molecular mimicry is supported by studies showing the presence of anti-MOG antibodies in the serum and CSF during the acute phase of the disease and their progressive decline with disease resolution. However, the pathogenetic role of these antibodies is still debated. Moreover, also IgG autoantibodies targeting epitopes derived from MBP, PLP, and MOBP, have been described.",

In addition to this mechanism, the infection may lead to a nonspecific self-sensitization of T cells against myelin autoantigens, by activation of costimulatory pathways and cytokine release [18]. This phenomenon, called \u201cbystander activation,\u201d may provoke the breakdown of T-cell tolerance. Hence, both cell-mediated and humoral effector mechanisms may play a role in the immune-mediated damage to the CNS in ADEM.",

Sometimes these perivenous lesions may coalesce, forming confluent areas. Typically, axons in the demyelinating lesions are relatively spared, but, in fatal cases of ADEM, extensive axonal damage has been observed. Axonal damage is demonstrated by an increased level of phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein (TAU), which is primarily located in neuronal axons, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Atypical findings include glial nodules in the gray matter (GM), perivascular necrosis, infiltration of the meninges and vasculitic-like lesions [20].",

A damage in the contest of occipital lobes may result in homonymous visual field defects and, if severe and bilateral, also cortical blindness. Patients may also show higher cortical function deficits, such as agraphia, alexia, aphasia, and acalculia. In the case of involvement of the motor cortex, patients may have pyramidal signs (i.e., Babinski sign, spastic hypertonus, and hyperreflexia). Sensory symptoms include astereognosis and agraphesthesia, or loss of proprioception, as well as reduction of pain and temperature perception. Patients with brainstem involvement may present palsy of the cranial nerves. The most common symptoms are: diplopia (both cranial nerve palsies and/or inflammation of the gaze-control centers), dysphagia, dysarthria, vertigo, nystagmus, hearing loss, reduced taste and smell sensitivity, and respiratory failure [19]. Brainstem involvement is usually associated with poorer prognosis and with a higher risk of fulminant disease course [23].",

However, variable proportions of patients (10\u201330% of all cases) with a multiphasic course (M-ADEM) have been described in the literature [11]. The time interval from onset to first relapse is quite variable, usually ranging from 2 months to 8 years [8]. Recurrence after three decades has been described in a single case [24]. Prognostic risk factors for a relapse include the coexistence of an optic neuritis, the presence of criteria for MS at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a family history of CNS disorders [25]. In most of M-ADEM patients, long-term clinical and imaging follow-up has shown the resolution of lesions with no long-lasting neurologic impairments [22]. Patients with the coexistence of M-ADEM and anti-MOG antibodies typically do not develop new lesions on MRI during the asymptomatic period [26].",

During the acute phase, about half patients with ATM are paraplegic. Other common symptoms are paresthesia, dysesthesia, numbness, impaired breathing, bowel and bladder dysfunction, paralysis, muscle weakness, or nerve pain. Initial severity of weakness and evidence of denervation on electromyography have been considered poor prognostic indicators for subsequent recovery [31].

The most important differential diagnosis in pediatric ADEM is pediatric MS and this distinction has prognostic and therapeutic implications. The differential diagnosis between ADEM and MS is based on clinical, laboratory, and MRI features:Clinical manifestations: in most cases of pediatric ADEM, patients present systemic symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status, which are typically uncommon in pediatric MS;Laboratory findings: the presence of OCBs is a hallmark of MS, and is atypical in ADEM. In challenging cases, anti-MOG antibodies detection may help the differential diagnosis: these antibodies are not generally associated with MS but suggest anti-MOG associated autoimmune demyelination. In patients with ADEM-ON, quantification of anti-AQP4 antibodies should be performed to make the correct diagnosis;MRI features may help distinguish ADEM from MS [46]. Key brain MRI features found in ADEM and absent in MS include periventricular sparing and the absence of periventricular ovoid lesions perpendicular to the ventricular edge (Dawson fingers) [35, 47, 48]. The discriminatory MRI elements between ADEM and MS are reported in Table 5.2 [19]. According to the current diagnostic criteria, no new clinical or MRI findings must be found 3 months or more after the clinical onset. If radiological evidence of new lesions is present, it is necessary to consider alternative diagnoses, such as MS or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders [22].",

The improvement of clinical conditions is usually seen within days after treatment start, with a complete recovery in most of cases within few weeks [19]. Residual severe disability is quite rare (7% of pediatric ADEM) [54]. In pediatric series, some patients (20\u201330% of cases) show residual neurologic deficits, in particular cognitive impairment (especially in the attentive and executive domains) [11] or changes in behavior and personality. These findings are more common in children with diagnosis of ADEM before 5 years of age.",
