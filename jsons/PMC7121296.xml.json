Many cardiovascular and hepatobiliary procedures result in massive hemorrhage and postpartum hemorrhage events in labor and delivery place the patient at a high risk for mortality. Gastrointestinal bleeding from diverticulosis, varices, and ulcer disease can result in significant blood loss requiring massive transfusion and resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock. Timely and effective transfusion of blood products is of critical in these scenarios. The frequency in which blood component products are transfused in surgical patients begs for a greater understanding of them. The aim of this chapter is to provide clinicians with a discussion of the current literature on the various blood component products, their indications, and unique hemostatic conditions in the surgical patient. While the majority of data concerning optimal management of acquired coagulopathy and hemorrhagic shock resuscitation is based on trauma patients, many of the principles can and should be applied to the surgical patient (or likely any patient) with profound hemorrhage.",

This phenomenon is further exacerbated by rapid infusion of unwarmed crystalloid fluid during initial resuscitation. This condition impairs coagulation factor activity and platelet function, such as their ability to produce thromboxane, and must be rapidly reversed [4]. Crystalloid and colloid fluids also contribute to hemodilution of clotting factors, further promoting ongoing bleeding. Hence, in this situation, early plasma therapy and platelets have been shown to improve outcomes [5].",

Preemptive strategies have been shown to actually reduce coagulopathy and the number of overall transfusions required to treat the patient [7, 8]. However, challenges to implementation include time limitations of laboratory-guided component therapy since the results of the tests are not immediate. Another difficulty is that once it has been determined that the patient should receive plasma, it may take another 30\u201345 min to thaw and deliver the products [5]. As such, hospitals should have in place a thawed plasma program, keeping adequate numbers of \u201cuniversal\u201d and type-specific thawed plasma available for immediate release. Plasma thawing protocols exist to avoid this issue and are discussed in later sections. In acutely bleeding patients, massive transfusion protocols are often activated in order to efficaciously restore blood volume and hemostasis and thawed plasma is critical to their success [5, 6].",

The efficacy of an MTP also lies in its early implementation as well as identification of patients who would benefit from such an intervention. Criteria for activation include laboratory values, anatomic injuries, and mechanism of injury. Several authors have demonstrated that the transfusion of uncross-matched RBCs is an independent predictor of substantial hemorrhage and the transfusion of multiple units of RBC, plasma, and platelets [10, 11].

One reason is that the coagulopathy is addressed after a time lapse since the original laboratory values were obtained. Other reasons for the suboptimal results of this method are due to the ratios of each blood component product infused. Specifically, evidence exists that demonstrates that large volume of crystalloid fluids is associated with increased hemorrhage and lower survival rates [13]. It has been hypothesized that this effect is due to insufficient replenishing of hemostasis factors, and the complex coagulopathy of dilution, consumption of factors, and fibrinolysis is not adequately addressed.

It also involves more permissive hypertension, and acting preemptively on the hypovolemic, hemorrhaging patient. DCR is also supported by findings from the US Army\u2019s Institute of Surgical Research, which demonstrated improvement in outcomes in severely bleeding patients who were transfused in ratios of products similar to whole blood.

It is, however, important to consider the underlying pathology responsible for exsanguination, such as in obstetric patients, as well as related comorbidities, such as uremia, pharmacologic anticoagulation, in assessing for need of blood products [5]. For instance, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 et al.\u2019s review of resuscitation in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding found that 1:1:1 ratios of pRBCs, FFPs, and platelets reduced dilutional coagulopathy, similarly to trauma patients [16]. Patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair are also vulnerable to coagulopathy due to systemic heparinization, hypothermia, and left-heart bypass with a centrifugal pump [17]. As well, several authors have noted its benefit in the vascular population [15, 18, 19]. Mell evaluated 168 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm who had massive hemorrhage in the perioperative period. Their findings showed reduced 30-day mortality in patients who were transfused 1:1 RBC to plasma ratios. These patients also experienced lower rates of colonic ischemia. The value of this study is that the average age of patients was 73 years, much older than the average trauma patient, demonstrating applicability of MTPs in different patient age populations [19].",

Young and colleagues surveyed members of the University Health System Consortium, consisting of 107 academic medical centers and 232 affiliated hospitals and found that only 60% of participating hospitals had thawed plasma sufficient for the first cycle of their MTP. This problem delays the critical availability of plasma in the initial phase of resuscitation. Reviews of plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusions alongside massive blood transfusion protocols have demonstrated that earlier use of plasma and platelets in trauma patients have decreased the incidence of coagulopathy [21]. Unfortunately, by the time one or more blood volumes have been lost, plasma may still be unavailable in the absence of a thawed or liquid plasma program. Hence, protocols have been established to reduce wastage of products and use them for patients in an efficacious manner [22].",

Their findings showed that treatment with epoetin alfa significantly increased hemoglobin concentration and the odds ratio for receiving an RBC transfusion compared to patients on the placebo arm was 0.28 [29]. Additionally, Vincent et al.\u2019s randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated that a once weekly dose of epoetin alfa augmented the erythropoietin response [30]. Knight et al.\u2019s review found that patients with cancers of various organs who did not have anemia, most due to correction with epoetin alfa, required less transfusions and experienced more quality of life [31]. However, epoetin alfa is limited by its delayed onset at 5\u20137 days. As for its effects on mortality, Corwin et al. conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 1,460 medical, surgical, or trauma patients [32]. Weekly injections of epoetin alfa were shown to decrease mortality at day 29 and day 140, especially in trauma patients compared to placebo. However, epoetin alfa was associated with an increase in thrombotic events, and did not affect the number of patients who received a transfusion of RBCs [32].",

However, they also noted increased mortality in patients who received plasma not part of a massive transfusion protocol. This finding may be due to the unbalanced ratio of transfusion of products, unlike in mass transfusion protocols, which call for 1:1 transfusion of RBCs and plasma. In addition, plasma transfusion was associated with increased risk of developing TRALI, and by itself did not reduce transfusion requirements [34]. Their findings, in the first comprehensive meta-analysis and systematic review of plasma transfusion outcomes, highlight the need of assessing each patient\u2019s indications for plasma. The maturation of this field will be needed to strengthen the findings, which the authors did note were subject to survivor biases in some studies. However, none of these studies involved the use of plasma in patients with hemorrhagic shock. In this population of patients, the incidence of multi-organ failure has been shown to be lower than comparison cohorts (most likely as a result of less overall transfusions in the higher plasma group) [13, 14].",

Decision-making for each transfusion requires laboratory testing, and each product must carefully be stored and transported to the site of need. When this is not possible, such as in acute settings with limited resources, whole blood transfusions can adequately resuscitate certain patients. Grosso et al. recount a case of collecting whole blood from hospital personnel donors in a US field surgical hospital in Kosovo [40]. This whole blood was used to treat exsanguinating coagulopathy in an acutely bleeding patient. The advantage of whole blood is its ability to increase hemoglobin levels, similarly to red blood cells, and its ability to restore blood volumes, similarly to crystalloids [40]. Because of its physiological ratios of each blood component, it may hold an advantage over individual blood component transfusions, but more work is necessary to substantiate this idea.",

In order to prevent this event, it is important to cross-match patient and donor blood whenever possible. The most common cause of hemolytic reactions due to transfusion of an incorrect match is clerical error. Hemolytic reactions in blood transfusions occur because each individual carries antibodies against the blood group (A or B) that it does not express endogenously. Hence, when products containing anti-A or anti-B antibodies in plasma, such as plasma, are transfused to patients of A, B, or both blood groups, the donor antibodies stage an attack on the patient\u2019s red blood cells.

            "text": "TRALI is defined as acute lung injury occurring within 6 h of transfusion with a blood product, with most commonly reported cases occurring due to FFP [43]. TRALI is the most common cause of death due to transfusion [35]. TRALI is characterized by respiratory insufficiency, not limited to but including tachypnea, cyanosis, dyspnea, and acute hypoxemia [43]. Unfortunately, the occurrence of TRALI in critically ill patients who received a blood transfusion is estimated to be around 25% and increases with each subsequent transfusion, has a mortality rate of approximately 40%, and it is the most common transfusion-related complication [16]. Eighty-five percent of patients with bleeding varices receive blood transfusions, and the trigger for transfusions is much debated. In patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, TRALI is further exacerbated by the presence of end-stage liver disease. Proposed mechanisms for this phenomenon have included antibody-mediated reactions, but these findings are not definitive and many are subject to selection bias due to no screening in the asymptomatic population [43]. Autopsies and animal models have suggested hyperactive PMN involvement, since mass infiltration was noted [43]. A two-event model has also been proposed, with the first event dictated by the clinical health of the patient and the second event by the quality (affected by storage, donor immunologic components) of the blood product [43]. The treatment of TRALI is aggressive respiratory support and ventilation in more severe cases, such as in critically ill patients [43]. Practices to reduce the risk of TRALI include prestorage leukoreduction as well as avoiding the use of old blood products, defined as older than 14 days for RBCs and older than 2 days for platelet concentrates. Another prevention strategy is using only male donors or donors who have never been pregnant due to look back studies showing fewer TRALI events in blood donations from those populations [16]. Eder et al. demonstrated that preferential distribution of plasma from male donors reduced the reported number of TRALI cases [44].",

Virus risks in the UK in FFP have been estimated at 1 in 8 million for HIV, 1 in 30 million for HCV and 1 in 900,000 for HBV [35]. Since up to 50% of adult donors are cytomegalovirus (CMV) carriers, there is a risk of transmission of this virus to patients, especially the immunosuppressed, transplant patients and neonates [35]. Compared to viral causes, bacterial, endotoxin and prion contamination rates are more rare [35]. In order to avoid this deleterious complication, virus-inactivated preparations of plasma exist, such as methylene blue and solvent-detergent treated products. While these options may offer increased viral protection, they have been associated with loss of clotting factors [35]. The most stringent testing protocols and sensitive tests may not ever eradicate the risk of infectious agent transmission due to several reasons. First, new pathogens of unknown methods of spread are constantly emerging and may not actively be screened for in its early emergence, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and West Nile virus. Another obstacle in prevention is the incubation period of pathogens before seroconversion of blood [29].",

            "text": "Another concerning complication is the loss of efficacy in stored blood, and the adverse effects it causes. These consequences of the storage process are known as a storage lesion. With current technology, the shelf life of red blood cells cannot be extended further than its physiological shelf life of 120 days, and 35 and 42 days is the limit of viability in whole blood and adenine-saline preservation, respectively [29]. Even this length of shelf-life results in counterproductive transfusions. Specifically, RBC products older than 2 weeks have been shown to not improve oxygen uptake in septic patients. In fact, RBCs of that age have been associated with higher mortality, increased adverse events, extended hospital stay, and electrolyte imbalances. This reduction in efficacy may be due to decreased ability of the older RBCs to unload oxygen [29]. Another proposed mechanism is that since stored RBCs have depleted nitric oxide, this may have a vasoconstrictive effect, leading to thrombosis and the observed increases in venous and arterial thrombotic events in patients with increased pRBC and platelet transfusions [42]. The question is how realistic it is to maintain strict storage age in a finite and scarce resource such as blood. A double-blind, prospective randomized pilot study demonstrated that controlling the storage age of RBCs in transfusion compared to the current standard of care is feasible and results in decreased exposure to older blood [47]. More evidence is needed to determine precisely the cut off age of RBCs in their efficacy and availability. In stored platelets, it has been estimated that the recovery rate of 5-day old platelets is about 50%, with many nonviable platelets being sequestered into the spleen [21]. For these reasons, there is some concern that platelet counts performed immediately after transfusion do not provide an accurate picture of platelet function [21].",

This approach, however, is limited by slow results, incomplete characterization of the coagulation abnormality, and poor prediction of patient outcome. Furthermore, CCTs, which are riddled with delays from time to arrival in the laboratory and duration of testing, end up reflecting the coagulation state of the patient after 30\u201345 min of interventions and resuscitation [54]. Since CCT only examines plasma factors, the integral role of platelets and their function is ignored. In addition, the CCT assesses only the extrinsic pathway, intrinsic pathway, and platelet count, painting an incomplete picture of the pathologies of clotting in the severely exsanguinating patient. These deficiencies are addressed by thrombelastography (TEG), a test that creates a dynamic, graphical representation of the coagulation characteristics of a blood sample from initial clot formation to fibrinolysis. Since specific coagulation components have specific disturbances on TEG, this test reveals diagnostic as well as therapeutic information [55].",

It is also known as activated clotting time (ACT) in r-TEG in order to denote intentional anticoagulant agents in the sample. Factor deficiency or severe hemodilution can prolong reaction time or ACT. Next, k-time represents the time needed to reach 20-mm clot strength, and has a normal range of 1\u20132 min. The -angle, normally between 66 and 82\u00b0, represents the rate of clot formation. In platelet deficiency or hypofibrinogenemia, where one of the two key components of clots are missing, the k-time is increased and the -angle is decreased. Oshita et al.\u2019s linear regression analysis of 36 samples from healthy individuals reported that MA and k-time were linearly related to platelet count [56]. The maximal amplitude (MA) of the tracing represents platelet contribution to clot strength (normal range 54\u201372 mm). It is decreased in states of platelet dysfunction and hypofibrinogenemia. The G-value represents overall clot strength, including platelet function as well as enzymatic, and is decreased in hypocoagulable states (normal 5.3\u201312 K dynes/cm2). The LY30 is the percent of amplitude reduction at 30 min after the MA, and is elevated in hyperfibrinolytic states (normal range 0.0\u20137.5%) [55] (Figs. 12.3 and 12.4).\n\n\n",

Their findings demonstrated that graphical r-TEG is available within minutes, an improvement compared to CCTs. They also demonstrated that ACT, r-value and k-time strongly correlated with PT, INR, and PTT. MA and -angle strongly correlated with platelet count, and ACT, r-value, -angle and MA were predictive of pRBC, plasma and platelet transfusions within the first 2 h of arrival. In fact, an ACT  >  128 predicted massive transfusion in the first 6 h and an ACT  <  105 predicted patients that did not receive transfusions in the first 24 h [55]. In addition, comparison of TEG and CCT in cardiopulmonary bypass patients found that TEG measures were useful surrogates for CCT values [57]. Because of the speed of their availability and predictive ability, integrating TEG results in MTPs can strengthen decision-making and management of patients and improve patient outcomes.",

These have shown mostly success in predicting the course of the patient and guiding therapy. The therapeutic options include various blood product components, ranging from whole blood to concentrations of individual factors. Using physiological ratios of pRBCs, FFP, and platelets have improved patient survival in the massively hemorrhaging patient. However, like all powerful therapy, they are associated with adverse effects. Preventative options, such as decreasing storage lengths and screening for infectious agents have drastically reduced these risks. Lastly, administering these products in a rapid and directed fashion would not be feasible without in-house triage and massive transfusion protocols. These algorithms include steps that must be taken to smooth out logistics of urgent transfusions, such as anticipating adequate thawing times of FFPs and collaborating with blood banks to crosscheck appropriateness of each order (Fig. 12.5).\n",
