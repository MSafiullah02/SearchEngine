Intracellular lysosomes undergo membrane permeabilization in response to extra\u2010 or intra\u2010lysosomal stimuli, and the involvement of lysosomal cysteine proteases in apoptosis has been confirmed in several systems.\n17\n, \n18\n However, the roles of the endogenous lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitor Cst C in apoptosis remain controversial. Upregulation of Cst C expression was found to correlate with oxidative stress\u2010induced apoptosis in cultured rat neurons,\n19\n and Cst C injection into rat hippocampus led to neuronal cell death in the granule cell layer of dentate gyrus in vivo,\n20\n indicating a possible functional role of Cst C in apoptosis induction. Since, the Cst C\u2010induced neuronal cell death could be inhibited by simultaneous co\u2010application of cathepsin B, the inhibitory activity of Cst C on a cysteine protease was proposed to be involved in the process of apoptotic neuronal cell death.\n20\n Recent studies indicated that the roles of Cst C in neuronal cell apoptosis induction include decreasing B\u2010cell leukemia\u20102 (Bcl\u20102) and increasing active caspase\u20109 protein levels via the Jun N\u2010terminal kinase (JNK)\u2010dependent pathway,\n21\n and upregulation and accumulation of the insoluble \u03b1\u2010synuclein in oligodendrocytes and neurons.\n22\n Interestingly, apart from these documented pro\u2010apoptotic roles, Cst C was also found to have anti\u2010apoptotic effects on neuronal cells. For example, expression of Cst C in PC12 cells derived from a pheochromocytoma of rat adrenal medulla prevents oxidative stress\u2010induced death in vitro.\n23\n In accordance with this finding, the anti\u2010apoptotic function of Cst C was further demonstrated in vivo in a mouse model of the inherited neurodegenerative disorder, progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1, where loss of function in cystatin B and enhanced cathepsin B and D activities are the underlying pathologies. Crossbreeding of the mice with either Cst C\u2010overexpressing transgenic or Cst C\u2010deficient mice revealed that Cst C levels in vivo can affect neuron degeneration caused by the proteases, indicating that Cst C partially prevents neural cell death in vivo through inhibition of cathepsins activity.\n24\n (Described in the section of Neuroprotective roles.)",

Proteolysis of antigen by cysteine cathepsins to generate immunogenic peptides and guide the transit of both major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) and MHC\u2010like molecules through the endocytic compartments are important intracellular activities in antigen\u2010presenting cells. As a potent inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, Cst C had initially been implicated in playing a regulatory role in the developmental control of MHCII presentation in dendritic cells (DCs) by inhibiting cathepsin S in invariant chain cleavage.\n25\n Consistent with the role of Cst C in antigen presentation, a cystatin homolog produced by the filarial nematode parasite was found to inhibit lysosomal cysteine protease activities, which subsequently impeded the generation of human B cells.\n26\n Further experiments using bone marrow\u2010derived DCs indicate that interleukin 6 (IL\u20106)\u2010mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation decreased Cst C expression and MHCII \u03b1\u03b2 dimer levels.\n27\n However, a separate study using mouse primary DCs isolated from Cst C\u2010deficient mice demonstrated that Cst C is neither necessary nor sufficient to control MHCII expression and antigen presentation in DCs.\n28\n These discrepant results obtained from different laboratories could be due to the different cell types investigated, and/or to the compensatory roles played by other cysteine protease inhibitors in the absence of Cst C. In support of this view, cell\u2010specific regulation of cathepsin activity by Cst C was identified in two similar antigen\u2010presenting cells in the brain: Cst C was found to inhibit cathepsin L activity in astrocytes, but does not regulate cathepsins L and S in microglia.\n29\n\n",

It is intriguing to think that Cst C adopts the unreactive dimer conformation as storage form, which quickly monomerizes in response to the stimulation of its target enzymes. This post\u2010translational regulation of Cst C by dimerization was first described in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, where Cst C is inactivated during the early part of its trafficking through the secretory pathway and then reactivated prior to secretion.\n118\n Interestingly, we found that steady\u2010state (immature) CD8+ DCs isolated from primary spleens constitutively contain Cst C homo\u2010dimers, which can be separated from monomers by size\u2010exclusion chromatography of cell lysates and their non\u2010reactivity with the Cst C target enzyme papain, supporting the notion that they are domain\u2010swapped dimers.
