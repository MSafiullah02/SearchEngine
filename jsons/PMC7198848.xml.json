Many lessons can be learnt from the cumulative experience of Asian ICUs dealing with the COVID-19, SARS, and MERS outbreaks. In this Review, we draw on the experience of Asian ICU practitioners from a variety of settings\u2014and available literature on the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and related conditions\u2014to provide an overview of the challenges the ICU community faces and recommendations for navigating these complexities. These challenges and recommendations are summarised in Table 1, Table 2\n.",

Epidemiological data suggest that NIV was associated with nosocomial transmission of SARS;34 however, human laboratory data suggest that NIV does not generate aerosols.35 Suggestions that HFNC might be safe are questionable: studies that might be taken to support the safety of HFNC were not designed to show whether or not HFNC is aerosol generating and did not examine the spread of viruses.36, 37 Moreover, although NIV might reduce intubation and mortality in mild ARDS,38 it is associated with higher mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS from multiple causes,39 and a high risk of failure in MERS.40 Although weak evidence suggests that HFNC might reduce intubation rates without affecting mortality in unselected patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure,41 delayed intubation as a consequence of its use might increase mortality.42 Thus, NIV and HFNC should be reserved for patients with mild ARDS until further data are available, with close monitoring, airborne precautions, and preferably use of single rooms.

Transfer of patients out of the ICU for investigations such as CT scans risks spreading SARS-CoV-2 and can be minimised with alternatives such as point-of-care ultrasound.62 The latter was prioritised by some Chinese ICUs, and evidence of varying degrees of an interstitial pattern and consolidation on lung ultrasonography now exists for patients with COVID-19.63, 64 Finally, the median ICU length of stay for COVID-19 was 8 days in a Chinese report;18 however, larger studies are needed to better understand the course of COVID-19 after admission to the ICU. WHO recommends that de-isolation of patients requires clinical recovery and two negative RT-PCR assays performed 24 h apart.61 Viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract continues beyond 10 days after symptom onset in severe COVID-19.65 This fact has significant implications for the use of isolation facilities.",

It should ideally be coordinated at a regional or national health-care systems level, and some countries have now provided guidelines for COVID-19.121, 122 A triage policy implemented by clinicians trained in triage or senior ICU practitioners, complemented by clinical decision support systems, might identify patients with such a low probability of survival that they are unlikely to benefit from ICU care.120 Although generic physiological outcome prediction scores might not accurately predict the course of illness,5 older adults with comorbidities, higher d-dimer and C-reactive protein concentrations, and lower lymphocyte counts do worse.5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24 Rationing of resources also involves the withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments for existing ICU patients.

Some of these questions have been listed as potential challenges in Table 1, Table 2. The short-term and long-term prognoses of critically ill patients have to be clarified. Data on the effectiveness of NIV and HFNC, and the associated risk of viral transmission, remain scarce.34, 35, 36, 37 The risk of nosocomial transmission in shared ICU rooms should be studied. More data on cardiac involvement and myocardial dysfunction are needed.11, 13, 15, 16, 23 The role of ECMO is unclear.49 The indications for corticosteroids should be crystallised, while considering interactions between different therapies.61 For example, although limited by confounding from differences in baseline severities, a post-hoc analysis of a non-COVID-19 ARDS trial suggested that beta-interferon use was associated with higher mortality compared with placebo in patients receiving corticosteroids, but not in those who were not on corticosteroids.123\n",

First, the surge of disease often outpaces the traditional steps for research, including protocol design, securing of funding, and ethics approval, all amidst busy clinical work. Pre-approved adaptable plans drawn prior to an outbreak are useful. For example, several interventions against SARS-CoV-2 are being incorporated into the Randomized, Embedded, Multi-factorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP), a pre-approved platform trial for severe community-acquired pneumonia.",

To this end, pandemics provide a great opportunity for collaboration. Platforms such as the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) and the International Forum for Acute Care Trialists (InFACT)\u2014formed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic\u2014enable large research networks to share common goals and standardise data collection globally.124 WHO has also produced a master protocol for trials on experimental therapeutics for COVID-19.125 Last, the pace of research and data sharing must be balanced with scientific quality and ethical integrity. China's rapid sharing of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic code had an immediate impact on case identification, isolation, and the spread of the virus.126 The COVID-19 pandemic also saw a ballooning of the number of preprints (manuscripts openly posted online before peer review). During the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, the median time between preprints and peer-reviewed publication was 150 days.127 Although preprints rapidly provide new knowledge, ICU practitioners should be aware of the potential compromise in data quality when the conventional peer-review process is bypassed. A systematic review also found that only 50% of Ebola intervention studies fully complied with frameworks for ethical trial conduct.128\n",

Even if SARS-CoV-2 infects a small proportion of the 7\u00b78 billion people on Earth, many thousands will still become critically ill and require ICU care. The ICU community must brace itself for this potentially overwhelming surge of patients and optimise workflows, in advance, for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention. Hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must work with ICU practitioners to prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity. They must protect health-care workers from nosocomial transmission, physical exhaustion, and mental health issues that might be aggravated by the need to make ethically difficult decisions on the rationing of intensive care. Researchers must address key questions about what remains a poorly understood disease. Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level\u2014with a focus on high-quality research, evidence-based practice, sharing of data and resources, and ethical integrity in the face of unprecedented challenges\u2014will be key to the success of these efforts.",

We also reviewed relevant references cited in retrieved articles. Articles published in English and Chinese were included. The final reference list was generated on the basis of relevance to the topics covered in this Review, with the aim of highlighting the multiple challenges the intensive care community might face in the management of COVID-19, and providing recommendations for navigating these complexities.\n",
