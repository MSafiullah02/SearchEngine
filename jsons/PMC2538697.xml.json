            "text": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes herpes labialis, herpes keratitis, genetic herpes and life-threatening herpes encephalitis. HSV infections are more severe in immunocompromised patients, which are characterized by chronic and extensive lesions of the mucous membranes (Whitley, 2001). Most therapies directed against HSV infections are nucleotides, nucleosides or pyrophosphate analogues, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir. After uptake by virus-infected cells, these drugs are phosphorylated by virus-encoded thymidine kinase, compete with the nucleotides to inhibit the viral DNA polymerase and subsequently cause the termination of growing viral DNA chains (Field, 2001). Although these drugs are effective in the treatment of many acute infections, the intensive use of these drugs has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients (Field, 2001). Therefore, there is a need to provide other drugs with distinct mechanisms as alternatives to existing therapies.",

            "text": "Alkaline nuclease, which is encoded by the UL12 gene of HSV-1, possesses both endonuclease and exonuclease activities under alkaline pH conditions (Hoffmann and Cheng, 1978; McGeoch et al., 1986; Knopf and Weisshart, 1990). Null mutants incapable of expressing UL12 are able to synthesize near wild-type levels of viral DNA, suggesting that UL12 is not essential for viral DNA replication in culture (Weller et al., 1991). Although UL12 is not essential for viral DNA synthesis, UL12 mutant viral yields are 0.1\u20131% of wild-type yields (Shao et al., 1993; Martinez et al., 1996a). The analysis of UL12 null mutants has shown that the decrease in virus yield results from the reduction of capsids exiting from the nucleus (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998). Analysis of replicating DNA from UL12 mutant-infected cells has shown that UL12 is implicated in resolving branched structures of HSV-1 replicative intermediates prior to encapsidation (Martinez et al., 1996a; Porter and Stow, 2004a, 2004b). Therefore, these results indicate that, even though UL12 is not essential for either viral DNA synthesis or packaging, UL12 is required for full efficiency of these processes. Additionally, these findings suggest that HSV-1 UL12 can be a novel target for anti-herpes viral drugs.",

Several potential viral targets, such as helicase\u2013primase complex and DNA polymerase, have been known to be involved in HSV-1 infection and for which specific inhibitors with anti-HSV activity, at least in cell cultures, have been identified (Crute et al., 2002; Thomsen et al., 2003; Greco et al., 2007). In the present study, we analysed the potent inhibitor of HSV-1 that targeted viral UL12. Our findings indicated that emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone), the naturally occurring anthraquinone present in the root and bark of numerous plants of the genera Rheum and Polygonum, inhibited HSV-1 UL12 activity, leading to the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus and the subsequent reduction of HSV-1 yields in Vero cells.",

We wondered whether emodin induces the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus by the inhibition of UL12 activity. Immunohistochemical staining, using anti-HSV-1 nucleocapsid protein antibody, was therefore performed to analyse the localization of viral nucleocapsids during emodin treatment. No fluorescent signal was observed in mock cells (Figure 6a). As expected, the nucleocapsids were localized diffusely in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm at 16 h post-infection because the HSV-1 progenies are assembled and released from cells at 16 h post-infection (Roizman and Knipe, 2001). In contrast, emodin induced the accumulation of nucleocapsid protein in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner at 16 h post-infection. Time course assay showed that, in the absence of emodin, nucleocapsids mainly remained in the nucleus at 3 h post-infection, diffused to cytoplasm at 5 h post-infection, and mainly localized in cytoplasm at 8 h post-infection. In contrast, the fluorescent signal mainly remained in the nucleus during emodin treatment. These findings suggest that emodin inhibited HSV-1 UL12 activity, leading to the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus and the subsequent reduction of HSV-1 yields.

Acyclovir is of significant therapeutic value and is considered as the \u2018gold standard' in HSV therapy. However, approximately 5% of the isolates from immunocompromised patients, which receive a long-term prophylactic treatment with acyclovir, have experienced the emergence of resistant strains (Danve-Szatanek et al., 2004). Even in immunocompetent populations, the prevalence of resistance ranges from 0.32 to 3.5% by large-scale studies (Fife et al., 1994; Danve-Szatanek et al., 2004). Therefore, the development of antiviral drugs with different mechanisms is an alternative approach to the control of HSV infections.",

            "text": "Viral proteins, that are known to be involved in HSV infection, have been used as the targets for chemotherapy. For examples, viral glycoproteins together with the cell membrane receptors are involved in viral attachment and penetration (Rajc\u00e1ni and Vojvodov\u00e1, 1998). Sulphated polymer-based inhibitors, which interact directly with viral envelope glycoproteins and prevent viral attachment, are now being tested in Phase II or III clinical trials (Keller et al., 2005). Helicase\u2013primase complex is essential for the unwinding of dsDNA and the generation of primers for DNA synthesis (Boehmer and Lehman, 1997). Aminothiazolyl-phenyl compounds (BILS 179 BS and BILS 45 BS) and thiazolyl sulphonamide compound (BAY 57-1293), that prevent the propagation of helicase\u2013primase catalytic cycle and inhibit its ATPase activity, respectively, display potent anti-HSV effects in mice (Crute et al., 2002; Duan et al., 2003; Biswas et al., 2007). Viral DNA polymerase is essential for DNA replication (Boehmer and Lehman, 1997). 4-Hydroxyquinoline-3-carboxamides (PNU-182171 and PNU-183792), that compete with incoming nucleotides and dislodge the template from the active site, display anti-herpes virus activities in preclinical animal studies (Thomsen et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2006). In principle, all the replication-essential viral proteins can be considered as potential targets for chemotherapy. This has raised the question. Is UL12 a possible candidate for anti-herpes virus therapy? Although UL12 mutants are able to synthesize near wild-type levels of viral DNA, the yields of mutant virus are reduced by 100- to 1000-fold (Shao et al., 1993; Martinez et al., 1996a). UL12 mutants display the failure of DNA-containing capsids to migrate into the cytoplasm and the more complex structure of replicative intermediates with an increased frequency of branches (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998; Porter and Stow, 2004a, 2004b). Additionally, antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, targeting an internal start codon of HSV-1 UL12 mRNA, inhibit HSV-1 replication in Vero cells (Chiba et al., 2000). Furthermore, emodin, that inhibited UL12 activity in vitro, displayed the reduction of HSV-1 yields in Vero cells in this study. These findings indicated that UL12, which is conserved in all species of Herpesviridae, can be considered as the target for the anti-herpes virus therapy.",

            "text": "Emodin, the active principle of herbal medicine derived from genera Rheum and Polygonum, has demonstrated antiviral effects to some enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis B virus, HSV, human cytomegalovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, and non-enveloped viruses, such as poliovirus (Barnard et al., 1992; Cohen et al., 1996; Semple et al., 2001; Dang et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2007). Several studies have revealed that the antiviral activity of emodin is through casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibition, which is exploited by viruses for the phosphorylation of proteins that are essential for viral life cycle (Yim et al., 1999; Battistutta et al., 2000). Moreover, emodin has affinity for phospholipid membrane and is effective in weakening hydrophobic interactions between hydrocarbon chains in phospholipid bilayers, contributing to the antiviral capacity of emodin against enveloped viruses (Sydiskis et al., 1991; Alves et al., 2004). In this study, we demonstrated that emodin can exert its antiviral activity by the third mechanism, the inhibition of HSV-1 UL12 alkaline nuclease activity. These findings suggest that emodin may be a potential anti-HSV-1 candidate with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that emodin inhibits HSV-1 UL12 activity, leading to the reduction of HSV-1 yields in Vero cells. How did emodin inhibit nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12? To answer this question, we modelled the three-dimensional structure of UL12 using phage \u03bb exonuclease as the template protein. Although HSV-1 UL12 exhibits a low amino acid sequence similarity (13.6%) with \u03bb exonuclease, HSV-1 UL12 shares similar enzyme activities and biological functions with \u03bb exonuclease. For example, both proteins preferentially degrade DNA from double-stranded end in the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 direction (Cassuto and Radding, 1971; Knopf and Weisshart, 1990). Moreover, they mediate DNA strand exchange by interacting with ssDNA-binding protein and participate in initiating viral recombination events (Muniyappa and Radding, 1986). The recognizable homology suggests that using \u03bb exonuclease as the template for the modelling of UL12 is reasonable. The interaction of emodin with UL12 was predicted by docking analysis. Results showed that emodin docked into UL12 but not bovine pancreatic DNase I (data not shown). Emodin interacted with Asp-227, Trp-231, Val-273, Asp-340, Glu-364, Val-365 and Lys-366 of UL12 via hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, some of these amino acid residues may be critical for the nuclease activity. Site-directed mutagenesis on the HSV-1 UL12 homologue, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNase, has revealed that Asp-203, Glu-225 and Lys-227 of Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNase, corresponding to Asp-340, Glu-364 and Lys-366 of UL12, respectively, play important roles in catalysis (Liu et al., 2003). Glu-225 of Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNase, corresponding to Glu-364 of UL12, is involved in metal binding. The docking of emodin into UL12 may affect or occupy the catalytic site of UL12, leading to the inhibition of nuclease activity. Therefore, the interaction between emodin and critical amino acid residues of UL12 may explain why emodin inhibited the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12.",

Serum profiles after oral administration of emodin at a dosage of 2 g kg\u22121 in mice showed that the peak serum concentration of emodin is 700 \u03bcM (Mengs et al., 1997). We revealed that emodin at a concentration of 21.5 \u03bcM was sufficient to reduce 50% virus yields without cytotoxic effect. Moreover, there is no evidence or equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in rats or mice (National Toxicology Program, 2001). Therefore, we speculate that the antiviral effect of emodin measured in vitro may occur in vivo. Furthermore, in addition to the inhibition of UL12, emodin possesses antiviral activities via the disruption of phospholipid bilayer and the inhibition of CK2. Therefore, these results suggest that emodin may be a potent herpes viral inhibitor with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities.",
