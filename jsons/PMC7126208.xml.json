All these proteins can be used as targets for anti-SARS drug development in principle. Among these structure proteins, S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein including two functional domains S1 and S2, which are conserved among coronaviruses. S1 is responsible for the binding with its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells and defines the host range of the virus [5]. The goal of this study is to construct a rational 3D model of S1, to identify noncanonical interactions in the structure of S1, possible inhibitors and antibodies, hence to provide important information for anti-SARS drug, vaccine and antibody discovery.",

In previous study, we have predicted the structure of SARS-CoV S2 protein [7]. Here, we used the same method 3D Jury system [8] to predict the 3D structure of SARS-CoV S1 protein based on the domain (residues 75-609) mentioned above. The proteins with sufficiently high 3D score were used as templates to construct 3D models of S1 by modeller program [9]. The quality of 3D model was evaluated by ProQ program [10] and finally validated with the procheck program [11]. The best model was used for further analyses. Specifically, NCI program [12] was used to identify non-canonical interactions in protein structures. VAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/VAST/vastsearch.html), DALI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/) and CE [13] programs were employed to search the structure neighbors of S1 protein. The structural comparison was performed by LGA [14]. The visualization of 3D structure was generated by PROTEINEXPLORER (http://www.proteinexplorer.org).",

Using them as templates the corresponding 3D models of S1 were generated and the quality of protein model was evaluated by ProQ program. The results are as follows: 1loq (ProQ-LG=0.969, ProQ-MX=0.055), 1ijq (ProQ-LG=1.955, ProQ-MX=0.101), 2bbk (ProQ-LG=0.877, ProQ-MX=0.057). So the \u2018correct\u2019 model (the cutoffs for \u2018correct model\u2019 are ProQ-LG>1.5 or ProQ-MX>0.1) for S1 protein is the model built on template1ijq. The sequence alignment between template 1ijq and S1 with ClustalW [15] and the secondary structures of S1 predicted by PsiPred v2.3 [16] are displayed in Fig. 1\n. Thus, the 3D model of S1 is basically composed of one long \u03b1 helix and six three-stranded \u03b2-sheets arranged in a propeller fashion (among them are a couple of small helices with 3\u20135 residues only) (Fig. 2), comparable to the structure of its template (low-density lipoprotein receptor): consisting of six four-stranded \u03b2-sheets arranged in a propeller fashion. It is not difficult to understand such a structure similarity in terms of their functions, the low-density lipoprotein receptor is responsible for the binding and entry into cells of lipoprotein ligands [17], while SARS-CoV S1 is also responsible for receptor binding and SARS-CoV entry into cells [5].",

Among these interactions, Trp171 accept one N\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 bond from Leu209 and donates one N\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 bond to Phe179, which forms a sandwich-like interaction, as existed in human rac1 [18] and SARS-CoV main protease [4]. These noncanonical bindings fix the helix Trp171 locate to the two \u03b2-sheets Phe179 and Leu209 locate, hence stabilizes the structure of S1 protein, but probably reduces the active site cavity for ligand binding (Fig. 3). Indeed, the non-canonical interactions have been shown to be important for the stability of protein structure [19], [20], [21] and ligand recognition [22].",

In fact, both type A and B neraminidases are composed of six four-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets arranged in a propeller fashion [23], [24] and resemble the structure of S1 stated above: basically composed of one long \u03b1 helix and six three-stranded \u03b2-sheets arranged in a propeller fashion. The common feature of these structures is that they share the same active center, as seen in their superpositions (Fig. 4). The structure alignment between 1INY, 1B9T and S1 is shown in Fig. 5\n. The result demonstrates that there are a number of similar structure patterns showing conservative residues (bold representation). Indeed, their functions are also similar: neuraminidase is an influenza virus glycoprotein embedded in the viral envelope, its function is to facilitate the release of progeny virions from infected cells to other cells [23], [24], while SARS-CoV S1 is also responsible for the entry of SARS-CoV into cells, as stated above.",

            "text": "Naturally, such a structure similarity between SARS-CoV S1 protein and influenza virus neuraminidase leads us to consider the possible application of neuraminidase inhibitors to SARS therapy. For example, Epana and RAI inhibitors have been shown to exhibit great potency for type A/B influenza viruses [23], [24]. Fig. 6, Fig. 7\nshows the structures of docking the two inhibitors from influenza virus to SARS-CoV S1 protein. It can be seen that these compounds can bind to the active center of S1 in the same way as they did in neuraminidase, the residues that make contact with the inhibitors (RMSD\u22645) are marked as \u2018#\u2019 in Fig. 5 and represented by blue ball-stick in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, among them are 10 conservative residues.",

Indeed, a very recent publication confirmed our speculation, Sui et al. [27] identified an anti-S1 human monoclonal antibody 80R, which potently neutralizes SARS-CoV infection and efficiently inhibits syncytia formation through blocking of S1 binding to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells. The sequence alignments between Nc10/Nc41 and 80R show more than 50% identity (Fig. 8).",
