Controlling airborne contamination is of major importance in these cases. The susceptibility of patients is partially due to infections (from the large amount of exposed area) and the unique environmental conditions (the required elevated temperatures and humidity in the patient room) that such rooms operate under. Furthermore, the biological quality of air in hospital environments is of particular concern as patients may serve as a source of pathogenic microorganism to staff and hospital visitors in addition to other admitted patients. A classic example of this problem is the tuberculosis outbreak in 2000 [25].",

            "text": "Motivated by these issues, it is clear that methods for prediction and control of these contaminants in indoor environments are needed. In this context, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been used extensively for determining airflow in indoor environments. The earliest reference to CFD being used for this purpose was the study of the velocity characteristics of ventilated rooms by P.V. Nielsen et al., in 1978 [27]. Since then the popularity of running CFD simulations for predicting air flow in indoor spaces has increased rapidly. ASHRAE has taken efforts to standardize CFD simulation procedures, i.e. to setup, simulate, and perform both verification and validation [1]. CFD simulations have also been integrated into building simulation programs like EnergyPlus [37] and ESP-r [16] for establishing boundary conditions of buoyancy based fluid flow. CFD flow fields have also been used for developing methods for scalar-transport in indoor environments. Validation for multi-zone CFD simulations with contaminant transport has been performed by building researchers [35], [40]. Other validations of scalar contaminant transport has been performed for ventilation efficiency [3], personal ventilation [22], occupant exposure [23] and dispersion [21] of toxic contaminants, and dispersion of contaminants in hospital wards [15]. The application of contaminant dispersion in the indoor environment applied to emergency situations was investigated by L. Wang et al. [41]. Many other application of contaminant transport in the indoor environment can also be found in scientific literature. A few examples include identification of sources using an inverse CFD approach [44], removal of contaminants using different ventilation strategies [17], and contaminant transport in an airliner by moving bodies [32].",

Buildings with a complex geometry could require specialized hardware simply to load the CFD data and mesh into memory. Specialized software packages or commercial software may also be needed to perform the transient contaminant transport simulation.

Comparisons of FFD and CFD along with implementation of FFD on graphical hardware with promising results have been recently accomplished by Zuo et al. [45], [46]. The lattice Boltzmann method uses kinetic theory to incorporate physics of micro/mesoscopic processes on the behavior macroscopic modules [9]. Lattice Boltzmann methods have been popular due to their ability for parallelization and implementation on graphical processing units (GPU)s [4], [42].

This was explored in the recent seminal work by Chen and co-workers for CFD data [10], [11] and Nicas for a multi-zone model [20]. These methodologies use either Lagrangian particle tracking or a contaminant flux to calculate entries of the Markov matrix. The Markov matrix is used to propagate concentrations of contaminants through time. The simulation results using the Markov method compared well with experiments and CFD simulations [10], [11]. The Markov method is extremely fast compared to Eulerian transport, as only a single matrix-vector multiplication is needed to perform the transient contaminant transport. Due to the speed of this method, real-time inference of the contaminant field can be performed. Furthermore, by utilizing sparse matrix storage this method drastically reduces the memory requirements needed to perform the analysis.",

Not only can Markov matrices be used for forward propagation of contaminants, but they can also be used for inferring the positions of the contaminants at previous times. The Markov matrix can be used to develop systematic optimization-based procedure for the optimal locations of actuators and sensors for the sensing and control of contaminants [39], [34]. Furthermore, the linear property of a Markov matrix can also be used to develop a systematic procedure using linear system theory for the optimal control and estimation of contaminant [38], [33]. Besides control and estimation applications, the spectral properties of the Markov matrix provides information about the long-term concentration profiles of contaminants in the space and the amount of time contaminants stay at a given position. Thus, utilization of the Markov matrix for flow field analysis and contaminant transport can be used to get more insight than the standard scalar transport methodology. An approach dual to the Markov approach using finite dimension approximation of Koopman operator is proposed by M. Georgescu et al. [14] for reducing order modeling in building system.",

We leverage these ideas to develop a systematic data-driven method for the construction of the Markov matrix from CFD data. Each state of the Markov matrix represents a discrete element area in 2D or volume in 3D. Fig. 7\ndisplays the transformation of state 11 for a time step \u0394t. For this example, each boundary of state 11 is discretized into 4 segments (5 particles). These particles on the edges of the states are evolved through time according to the underlying flow field. After the transformation of the element, the entries of the Markov matrix are calculated by taking the intersection between each state and the transformed area or volume, Fig. 7. Fig. 7 shows how the area of transformed state 11 is intersected with the states 11, 12, 19, and 20. The percent of the area or volume found in each state with respect to new transformed area or volume provides the information necessary to assign values to the Markov matrix. Since the transformed element initiated from state 11, Fig. 7, the row of the Markov matrix being filled is row 11. Approximately 43% of the area of the transformed state ended up in state 19. Therefore the Markov entry row 11 and column 19 is 0.43 (P(11,19) = 0.43). Following this process, the other entries in row 11 of the Markov matrix in the example displayed by Fig. 7 are P(11,11) = 0.16, P(11,12) = 0.18, and P(11,20) = 0.23 for the ending states 11, 12, and 20 respectively.",

The peak of the curves (Fig. 12) maximizes the number of the particles in their neighboring states, which corresponds to the ideal time step for the Markov matrix. After the peak, a number of particles start to leave the neighboring states into other states in the domain. Once again for the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard problem the noise is due to the states returning to their nearest neighbors after a long time step. The absorbed state curves and the nearest neighbor curves in Fig. 11, Fig. 12 are clearly a function of the Markov state size. As the Markov state size is decreased each of the cures are shifted to the left. Therefore as the Markov state size is decreased, the time steps chosen should also decrease. Also notice that for very large (coarse discretization) Markov state sizes the curves seem to have discontinuous jumps. As the number of states are increased by reducing the size of the states, the curves become smoother. This relationship shows that very coarse Markov states may have an unsatisfactory performance.",

This work formulates methods to determine the number and size of the Markov states, provides simple equations for the choosing the time step associated with the Markov matrix, and a procedure based on flow physics to determine the number of particles to represent the Markov elements. The methods provided in this work showed excellent agreement with the scalar transport methods well established in the field. An explicit procedure was articulated for application to other indoor airflow problems. For the two example problems the Markov method was able to predict contaminant transport at least 3000 times faster than the corresponding PDE based approach. Although the boundaries of the example problems are geometrically relatively simple, the method is naturally extended to complex boundaries, as well as to transient flow fields. The established methodology created in the paper has been applied to buoyant and inertial driven flow field. This procedure opens the door for real-time sensing and control of airborne infectious diseases, ventilation of indoor environments, and demand response and isolation during biological attacks.",
