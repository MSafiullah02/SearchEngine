Whereas historically, Ebola epidemics spread via person-to-person transmission, the current outbreak in West Africa has seen unexpectedly extensive spread of nosocomial disease, despite HCWs' reliance on previously effective infection control procedures such as patient isolation, barrier nursing procedures, and required personal protective equipment (PPE) [1] . Indeed, infection struck even among HCWs caring for patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Western hospitals equipped with modern facilities and procedures. This has sparked growing concerns regarding how to protect HCWs [2] , even those working outside the illprepared and overwhelmed regions of West Africa now grappling with Ebola [1] .",

We contend that during the height of the SARS epidemic, HCWs in institutions that failed to identify designated zones of risk simply assumed they were secure from risk as long as they were not in proximity to patients with highly contagious pathogens. However, their confidence in existing barrier precautions and PPE as providing sufficient protection when away from heavily contaminated areas proved unwarranted [8] . As it turned out, consistent use of PPE and negative pressure isolation rooms was insufficient because the main cause of nosocomial SARS transmission was casual contact with fomites in contaminated environments either outside of isolation zones or during removal of PPE [8, 9] .",

Healthcare workers (HCWs) in a clean zone are required to don personal protective equipment (PPE) before entering the zones of risk. When departing a zone of risk, but prior to entering a clean zone, HCWs are required to undergo decontamination and remove PPE in an intermediate zone.
