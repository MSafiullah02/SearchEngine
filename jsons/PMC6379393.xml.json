There is considerable evidence that such pandemics are likely to become more frequent unless action is taken to mitigate their spread at a global scale4\u20137. For this reason, resilience management for outbreaks has attracted a growing body of literature, both from epidemic modelers and the optimization and control community. One of the most critical aspects of resilience management is the need to combine accurate epidemic growth models with detailed outbreak control strategies8, representing a gap in the literature which this study aims to fill.",

At a global scale, passenger air travel is known to play a critical role in the spread of infectious disease16,27,38\u201341. Additionally, border control has been shown to play a pivotal role in mitigating epidemics, especially during the emerging stage of outbreaks5,42\u201345. Border control is typically deployed at airports in an attempt to prevent the spread of an infectious disease between cities, states and countries through passenger air travel46.

            "text": "In this work we present a novel mathematical modeling framework that integrates both outbreak dynamics and outbreak control into a decision-support tool for mitigating infectious disease pandemics at the onset of an outbreak through border control. The border control mechanism considered in this work is passenger screening upon arrival at airports (entry screening), which is used to identify infected or at-risk individuals and provide immediate treatment and isolation to reduce the risk of further transmission47. The uncertainty of exit screening effectiveness in other countries combined with the possible development of symptoms during a flight48 has prompted several governments to deem entry screening as crucial to the protection of their countries49, and further motivates its use in this study. The proposed model seeks to determine the optimal set of airports that should be allocated screening resources (technology and personnel), and the corresponding amount (thus dictating the proportion of arriving passengers that can be screened) such that the outbreak risk is minimized. We propose an ensemble of control strategies that exploit the heterogeneity of the air traffic network structure and outputs from an outbreak simulation model in the allocation of control resources. We evaluate each control strategy using a stochastic metapopulation epidemic model, and compare the strategies based on their effectiveness in reducing the spread of outbreaks. Note that we are not proposing or evaluating air travel restrictions, which have substantial economic costs as well as recognized limitations in their ability to prevent or reduce the scale of pandemics24,33,50\u201354. The goal of the proposed decision-support framework is to optimize the use of airport screening for border control to minimize the harm, i.e., number of infected persons and cities, posed by the introduction of a new disease into susceptible cities, thus providing local public health authorities more time to plan, prepare and distribute local control strategies, e.g., anti-virals, vaccines, source exit screening etc., which must be rapidly administered if/when infection is introduced.",

We extend this line of work through the following substantial contributions: (1) we model outbreak dynamics using a stochastic metapopulation framework as opposed to a deterministic model, (2) we propose and evaluate a novel set of control strategies, (3) the control strategies are embedded within a resource constrained decision-support framework, (4) the model is calibrated using historical outbreak data, and (5) a case study is presented for the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. Additionally, a range of sensitivity analysis is conducted to illustrate the robustness of the model with regards to variability across outbreak scenarios, disease parameters, policy considerations, and modelling assumptions. The analysis elucidates key trade-offs in terms of budget availability and outbreak mitigation which can be leveraged to inform on public health policy for global epidemic preparedness and control.",

Our metapopulation model is based on a global air travel network which connects local, city-level, populations. Formally, the proposed metapopulation network can be represented by a graph G = (V, E) where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of directed edges in the network. Nodes represent cities and edges represent passenger travel routes, possibly including stopovers, among cities. At each node of the network, we locally model outbreak dynamics using a discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model57. The time steps are set to be t \u2208 T = {1, 2, \u2026, tobs} where tobs is the time step where the state of the outbreak is being evaluated.

The path-based formulation, while more complex, enables more effective control decisions to be identified by the model. Specifically, the model is able to accurately capture the effect of controlling at stopover airports along a route, as well as identify the most cost-effective control decisions which utilize information about the entire path. For example, consider a group of travelers departing a high-risk infected region, e.g., Sierra Leon during an Ebola outbreak, destined for ten different destination cities; and all ten routes include an initial stopover at the same airport, e.g., JFK. By accounting for the complete path information, the model is able it identify the critical role played by JFK in this scenario, which further enables it to be optimally selected for control. Without accounting for the full travel paths of the routes, the critical role of JFK would be unidentifiable by the model.",

In addition, we define \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] the likelihood to travel when infectious, with \u03bb = 1 representing the case where infected and healthy individuals are equally likely to travel. This parameter aims to represent the impact of reduced travel demand when infectious individuals are unable to travel due to severe symptoms. Finally, we assume that compartmental edge flows are proportional to tail node states, i.e. the number of travelers in a state is proportional to the number of individuals in this state at the origin node.

The combination of Eqs (1a), (1b), (3c) and (3d), hereby to as (3), can be viewed as a control-driven stochastic metapopulation epidemic model wherein variables xi,t represent the level of control over time space in the network. An illustration of the combined effect of node controls along a path with stop-overs is provided in the Supplementary Material (Section A). A control rate of less than one can be interpreted as shortcomings of the methods or technology involved with screening. We assume that passengers coming into a controlled airport who are successfully identified as infected individuals are isolated for treatment, and hence are no longer able to spread infection. In terms of the model, infected individuals screened at a controlled node are assumed to transition to the recovered state R. The main objective function is to minimize the expected cumulative number of infected individuals at the observation time31.

The sorted node set is assumed to be pre-processed by one of the sorting criteria discussed in Table 1. At each iteration, the algorithm picks the next node i of the sorted set and determines whether this node can be fully controlled (xi = 1) without exceeding the available budget B. Variable U represents the consumed budget. If the node can be fully controlled, the consumed budget is incremented by si + gs(1) which corresponds to the cost of control for xi = 1. Otherwise, the algorithm checks whether node i can be partially controlled: this is possible only if there is enough budget remaining to cover the node setup cost si. If this is possible, the remaining budget is depleted and used to deploy control resources at node i. The control level of node i is determined by taking the inverse of the variable cost function gs(xi) corresponding to the remaining budget available, i.e. B \u2212 U \u2212 si. After this last pass, the remaining budget is null and the algorithm stops.",

Each control strategy tested is presented in Table 1, as well as the Baseline (B), in which no control is implemented. The first control strategy, Largest Population (LP) simply targets control at airports in cities with the largest population. The next three strategies exploit known properties of the air traffic network, specifically its hub and spoke structure. The Most Travelled (MT) strategy seeks to target control at airports that are highly trafficked based on total incoming and outgoing volumes, while the Most Connected (MC) and Effective Path (EP) strategies seek to target control at airports that are highly connected to the outbreak source based on travel volumes. The last two strategies utilize learned outcomes from a stochastic epidemic simulation model to inform outbreak control. The First Case (1C) strategy aims to control the set of airports most likely to see the first infected passenger (for a given outbreak scenario), while the First Order Uniform (1OU) targets control at the airports where it is likely to have the largest relative marginal impact. The four strategies, MC, EP, 1C and 1OU utilize knowledge of initial outbreak conditions, while MT and LP airport sets are selected independent of the outbreak state.",

Thus, the planning time period considered (50\u2013100 days) is intended to represent the high risk period at the early stages of a potential epidemic, and potentially before local control is fully in effect.

As expected, when no control is deployed (Panel A), there are substantially more cities affected than there are under any of the control strategies considered (Panels B\u2013F). While both MC/EP and MT (Panels B and E, respectively) control relatively few and more spatially sparse airports, EP (Panel B) provides substantially greater reduction in both the outbreak size and number of affected cities (as depicted in Figs. 1 and 2) due to the strategic nature of the path-based metric. In contrast, MT (Panel E) is the second worst performing strategy, and spends large portions of its budget on controlling fewer, more heavily travelled airports, which may not play a critical role in the early stages of the outbreak. The poorest performing strategy is LP (Panel F), which, perhaps surprisingly, controls more airports than all other strategies. However, many of these airports are far-removed from the outbreak source in terms of traffic volumes, and are therefore less likely to contribute to spread early in the outbreak. Strategy 1C (Panel C) suffers from similar faults, indicating that budget is spent on airports that are less expensive to control, but also provide less overall impact. These results further highlight the necessity for optimized resource allocation in the context of outbreak control.",

At $0 bil and $1.25 bil the strategies perform nearly the same, which represent the cases of no control and close to full control at all airports, respectively.

The weaker strategies, MT and LP, decrease in a more linear fashion compared to the other four, MC, EP, 1C and 1OU, which show evidence of decreasing marginal returns, e.g., there is negligible improvements after the budget reaches $0.75 bil.

First, the model only accounts for passenger air travel, and excludes mobility within and between cities via other modes of transport. Second, local disease spread (within a city) is modeled deterministically, and a uniform contact rate is used across all populations. Third, the model is currently limited to global control decisions through passenger screening, and does not evaluate local control mechanisms (prophylaxtics, vaccines, school closures, etc), with the exception of source exit screening. Fourth, airport (rather than route) screening rates are the control variable, and therefore assume passenger screening to be uniformly applied across all incoming routes at a given airport. Planned extensions of this work will address these limitations through i) integrating alternative modes of transport into the model, ii) adding additional decision variables to optimize local control decisions, iii) the development of a link-based modelling formulation to allow specific travel routes to be identified for screening (as opposed to airports), and iv) introducing a dynamic resource allocation formulation which relaxes the assumption of constant control across the entire planning period. These extensions would provide more degrees of freedom to improve the impact of control resources and further help in minimizing the risk posed by global outbreaks.
