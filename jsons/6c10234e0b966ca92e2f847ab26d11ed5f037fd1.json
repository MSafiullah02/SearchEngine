The Mexican Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan, developed and implemented since 2005, was a decisive element for the early response. Major lessons-learned were the need for flexible plans that consider different scenarios; the need to continuously strengthen routine surveillance programs and laboratory capacity and strengthen coordination between epidemiological departments, clinicians, and laboratories; maintain strategic stockpiles; establish a fund for public health emergencies; and collaboration among neighboring countries. Mexico responded with immediate reporting and transparency, implemented aggressive control measures and generous sharing of data and samples. Lessons learned induced changes leading to a better response to public health critical events.",

On April 24, the Federal Government mandated the implementation of various nonpharmaceutical interventions, which included social distancing measures such as self-quarantine for individuals experiencing mild symptoms, temporary school closure, and mass gathering (soccer games, concerts, church services, among others) postponements or cancellations. Within days, the MOH developed a mass media plan developed detailed within the Pandemic Influenza Response Plan (PIRP) and habilitated a national mass media campaign. 7 A post outbreak study reported that close to 90% of the Mexican population received a preventive message, which elicited some preventive behavioral change. 8 Protocols were released for the epidemiologic surveillance of sample collection, transport, and storage, along with medical attention including triage and clinical guidelines for treatment of patients. On-line courses for primary care physicians and hospital clinicians were also implemented. One lesson is that early involvement of the highest-level authorities of sectors involved in decision-making and pandemic response is pivotal. Mexico achieved this by convening an early meeting of the National Public Health Council (CSG for its acronym in Spanish), a body of the Mexican State directly dependent of the president with the authority to issue inter-sectoral mandatory interventions for pandemic control.",

Responsible science communication and media: Diagnosis at PHSL facilities relied in immunofluorescence which are known to have a low negative predictive value. This created political misunderstanding and distrust, as some politically sensitive samples such as those reported as negative by states with no AH1N1pdm09 cases were later confirmed as positive by the federal laboratory, using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) test. The media quickly caught on to this discrepancy and created unfavorable media coverage to the response. 5. Healthcare provider planning and preparedness: With regard to medical care and the organization of ICUs, the medical staff in many hospitals were not adequately prepared for prompt recognition and treatment of serious forms of influenza in young adults. There was a significant lack of planning for hospital reorganization, triage, and treatment of an excess caseload of influenza. Intensive care units did not have PIRP in place to develop capacities for the epidemic, including but not limited to insufficient personnel, supplies, and equipment for mechanical ventilation. These limitations and the fact that Mexico was one of the first countries affected may explain the high mortality observed in comparison with other countries. 9,10 6. Weak regulatory and logistic frameworks: The strategic stockpile of oseltamivir was stored in bulk powder containers, with the PIRP stipulating that reconstitution would be carried out at InDRE and the PHSL network. However, it immediately became apparent that it had been a mistaken assumption. These laboratories had neither the facilities, training, nor the legal authorization to fill prescriptions or reconstitute the powder into tablets or liquid for direct prescription. This plan ended in a complex regulatory issue and delayed the use of the stockpile. In the end, tablets were fabricated with the collaboration of the original pharmaceutical provider.",

This restricted the provision of needed supplies or equipment (aside from antivirals and antibiotics, and the laboratory network, which did receive funding). For example, the lack of funding limited the conduction of the initial field investigations needed for interviewing and collecting blood samples from patients diagnosed with or exposed to AH1N1pdm09.

The experience in Mexico calls to attention the following: Containment strategies might have limited success: The novel AH1N1pdm09 pandemic virus moved within and beyond Mexico too quickly for social distancing policies to impact in full force and spread rapidly to other regions of the world. Alerts discouraging non-essential travel to Mexico served no purpose as they did not contain the outbreak and did not prevent its further international spread. By the end of the year, more than 100 countries were reporting cases. This observation is consistent with the ample geographical spread of other emergent infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS; 29 countries) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (27 countries), and currently, SARS-CoV-2 started in China and currently is quickly spreading across the globe to 58 other countries.",

[11] [12] [13] In order to prevent global spread of the next influenza pandemic, public health officials need not only to predict the location but also to detect it within weeks of its emergence. New methods that rely on artificial intelligence may at some point in time increase our ability to predict and detect earlier these threats. At the time, both goals seem impossible, as there will always be a delay between the emergence of the outbreak's index case and the detection of the outbreak by healthcare providers, laboratories, or public health authorities.

            "text": "Early cases are the most vulnerable: When a new infectious agent causes an outbreak, the first country affected most likely suffers the most. Mexico experienced a higher AH1N1pdm09 influenza mortality burden than other countries for which estimates are available; of note was the particularly high case fatality ratio reported (the case-fatality ratio among ILI cases was 1.2% overall and 5% among laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1, compared to 0.05% and 0.03% in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively). 5, 6, [14] [15] [16] It is estimated that in the first year after the emergence of the (H1N1)pdm09, between 28% and 34% of the Mexican population was infected with the new virus, 4 disproportionately affecting individuals aged 5-59 years. According to Charu et al., the (H1N1)pdm09 was associated with 445,000 Years of life lost (per 100,000 population) between April and December 2009 11 and a mortality burden 0.6-2.6 times that of a typical influenza season. 12 Enhance early detection and contact tracing: The fact that the pandemic began in the area around the Mexican-US border or Northern central part of Mexico, rather than, for example, in South East Asia, led to another important lesson: influenza pandemics can start in any location. 17 The original pandemic plan assumed a scenario for protecting Mexico from an outbreak originating in East Asia, with a 6-to 10-week delay before the detection of first cases. Looking back at the early response, a rapid containment strategy is crucial to control or reduce the pandemic risk, with movement restriction, antiviral prophylaxis, and public health interventions to reduce social contact. Detection, investigation, and reporting of the first cases, with appropriate contact tracing, must happen quickly. The first weeks of an outbreak are critical for developing a thorough understanding of transmission dynamics and severity of the disease. Decisions at this stage need to be made quickly, but unfortunately, decision are made under a considerable degree of scientific uncertainty.",

Early sharing of samples and international collaboration made possible the development, testing, and production of a targeted AH1N1pdm09 influenza pandemic vaccine within 3 months. However, not enough of the vaccine was produced to meet the demand; it arrived at a high price (2-3fold the price of the seasonal vaccine), and countries negotiated individually in a closed format. Equitable access to vaccines was not achievable; Mexico received its first vaccine shipment late in December 2009, several months after Canada and the United States had started their vaccination programs. The lesson here is at global level; countries need to work in a new framework to improve equitable access to influenza vaccines in pandemic situations. The efforts to establish national self-sufficiency for influenza vaccine were not ready at the time of the outbreak. This effort is encouraging but until now has failed to guarantee this important health security issue 19 and need attention.",
