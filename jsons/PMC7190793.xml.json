Many of these conditions are caused by excess body fat; a condition termed overfat (7, 8). The overfat condition itself is a significant yet little discussed risk factor in infectious viral diseases (9, 10), with overfat negatively affecting immune function and host defense mechanisms (11). It has been shown that both viral and bacterial pathogenesis is adversely altered in overfat hosts (11\u201314). While the viral infections all have different responses in human hosts, albeit similar, hospitals, and other critical care centers are applying their knowledge and skills concerning influenza to those with Covid-19 until more data and research is available specific to the Covid-19 virus (15).",

In addition, some unique clinical features include upper respiratory tract symptoms like rhinorrhoea, sneezing, and sore throat, intestinal symptoms like diarrhea, and tissue infiltration of the upper lobe of the lung (17). Covid-19 also targets the central nervous system (18). It may be too early to know whether Covid-19 is capable of immune evasion (the blunting of an effective immune response) associated with increased tissue damage, especially in those with impaired immunity (16).",

Overfat has also been shown to aggravate the effect of seasonal influenza on respiratory mortality independent of the effect of comorbidities and meteorological factors (31).

Importantly, very-low carbohydrate/ketogenic diets have been successfully applied in conditions that include epilepsy, metabolic disorders, cancer, neuronal loss, and muscle and nerve degeneration (46, 47). The diets have also been successful in reducing excess body fat (48) and chronic inflammation (49). Very-low carbohydrate/ketogenic diets may also be protective in promoting a positive immune response against influenza virus infection (50).",

Vitamin D can act as an immune modulator, prevent excessive expression of inflammatory cytokines, increase the \u201coxidative burst\u201d potential of macrophages, stimulate the expression of anti-microbial peptides in neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer cells, and in epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract where they play a protective role (52). However, those who are overfat have consistently lower vitamin D levels across age, ethnicity, and geography (53). The seasonality of infectious disease outbreaks suggests that environmental conditions have a significant effect on disease risk. In particular, ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure and associated increases in vitamin D levels share common pathways of innate immune activation (54).",

The Covid-19 and overfat pandemics are two serious public health concerns that are correlated, despite having very different horizons and timescales. Both require urgent attention. Jones (55) writes in the New England Journal of Medicine that, while some experts warn half the world's population could be infected by the end of 2020, resulting in more than 100 million deaths, such a perfect storm is exceedingly rare. It is however, regrettably, one that is possible. Perhaps a more important lesson for the world may be that we control much of our health, and that the prevention of infections through a healthy immune system is, not unlike chronic disease and physical impairment, strongly associated with a healthy lifestyle.",
