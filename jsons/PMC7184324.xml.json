This advice is based on the likelihood that virus is transmitted through large airborne droplets and/or from surface and dermal contamination of those droplets. The relative importance of direct inhalation, hand to the peri-oral zone and surface-to-hand to peri-oral zone, and ocular exposure routes has not been determined. It is in this area in particular that occupational hygiene can offer considerable scientific expertise relevant to understanding exposure routes, pathways, and the potential drivers of transmission.",

Many of these studies can help us to consider the frequency of hand\u2013mouth contact at work (Gorman Ng et al., 2016), what influences such behaviour, and also the characteristics of liquids that influence transmission from surfaces to skin and from hand to mouth (Gorman Ng et al., 2013, 2014). While most of these studies have looked at dusts and chemical liquids rather than body fluids containing biological agents, they can provide an important framework to conceptualize exposure pathways and look at ways to change how work is carried out to help minimize the risk of exposure and infection.",

We know that PPE is often the control measure of last resort given the many difficulties in getting workers to wear PPE correctly throughout all of the time it is required. However, the relative role of inhalation and hand to mouth transmission is still unclear. While powered air purifying respirators may be a solution for protecting healthcare workers (Brosseau, 2020), these are unlikely to be practical in many lower risk work settings. Wearing surgical masks is likely to reduce inhalation of very small droplets by 20 to 30% whereas a disposable respirator certified to an appropriate standard can, on average, reduce the concentration by 95% (Cherrie et al., 2018; Steinle et al., 2018). There is the potential that wearing masks may discourage people from touching their face or, conversely, could increase such activity due to frequent moving of the mask, unconscious \u2018fidgeting\u2019 or from irritation of the area around the nose and mouth: there is a need for research to examine the frequency of hand to peri-oral contact during mask wearing in different environmental situations. Gloves may have similar impacts on behaviour and work published in this journal has examined the impact of contamination from donning and doffing dirty gloves albeit in relation to pesticides rather than biological material (Garrod et al., 2001).",

More considered behavioural nudges to increase personal awareness of our hand activity or limiting the need to spend time in close contact with others may be worthy of development to limit spread. Developing an electronic sensor to detect inadvertent touching of the face and alerting the individual could be a useful innovation: this week has seen the launch of a website that uses laptop or mobile phone camera technology to discourage users from touching their face (The Guardian, 2020). Reducing time required at a central workplace, working remotely or delivering services through video or telephone may be an option for some workers, and all of these clearly also beneficially align with efforts to limit travel in relation to reducing carbon emissions and congestion in urban centres.",
