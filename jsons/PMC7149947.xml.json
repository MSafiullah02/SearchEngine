Nevertheless, given its relative simplicity, studying the virus has always been more tractable. As outlined in the previous chapters, virus-centric approaches have yielded a tremendous amount of information about viral genetics, viral replication cycles, and host and tissue tropisms. Along the way have come insights into host innate and adaptive immune responses and the many ways in which viruses antagonize these responses while exploiting other cellular processes to their advantage. In the last decade, however, new opportunities to study the host response have emerged. In 1990, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy announced a plan to map and sequence the human genome. Eleven years later, the first draft of the genome was released, and in 2003, the project was declared complete.",

            "text": "The sequencing of the human genome dramatically changed the field of viral pathogenesis. Virologists were now able to move beyond virus-centric or single-gene approaches and instead investigate the host response to infection on a genome-wide scale. With the human genome sequence in hand, it became possible to predict the complete constellation of human genes, their corresponding mRNA transcripts, and encoded protein products. This information spurred the development of methods to measure global gene expression and protein abundance, which in turn mandated the development of computational methods to interpret the resulting avalanche of data (Sidebar 1\n).Sidebar 1The evolution of systems biologyThe sequencing of the human genome and the advent of high-throughput molecular profiling are widely credited with giving rise to systems biology. In one sense this may be true. The convergence of genome sequence information, profiling technologies, and computational advances made it possible to examine biological systems on a scale never before possible. However, the concepts underlying systems biology, and an understanding of the need to comprehend complete systems, have deeper roots. The notion of emergent properties\u2013properties or outcomes that cannot be predicted by an understanding of the individual parts of a system alone\u2014dates back at least to the time of Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC), who stated: \u201cthe whole is something over and above its parts and not just a sum of them all.\u201d Nevertheless, reductionism\u2014the idea that complex systems can be analyzed and understood by reducing them to manageable pieces\u2014held sway through much of modern history. In the early 1900s, views began to change. It became apparent, for example, that biological systems have hierarchies of organization, and that components of a system behave differently in isolation than when in the intact system (Trewavas, 2006).The first known use of the term systems biology, and its proposal as a distinct discipline, is attributed to Mihajlo Mesarovic in his 1968 book Systems Theory and Biology. Then, as now, systems biology was met with some skepticism. A reviewer of the book noted: \u201cThere is no doubt that system-theoretic ideas seem somewhat strange, and perhaps just a little frightening, to the present generation of structurally-oriented biologists\u201d (Rosen, 1968). The current concept of systems biology\u2014driven by genome-based technologies and mathematics\u2014is most often associated with Leroy Hood, founder of the Institute for Systems Biology. Hood proposed that biological systems are composed of two types of information, genes and networks of regulatory interactions, and that biology be viewed as an informational science (Ideker et al., 2001). In this view, studying biological systems requires detailed knowledge of the components of the system, systematic perturbation of the system, monitoring of gene, protein, and pathway responses, and the formulation of mathematical models to describe the system and its response to perturbation (viral infection being an example of such a perturbation). Today, systems biology has become a driving force in biology and medicine, although it is still often criticized for being too focused on data acquisition. As put by Nobel Laureate Sidney Brenner: \u201cEverybody wants to measure everything, you\u2019ll never get anything out of it.\u201d Such criticisms may eventually be muted, however, as systems biology continues to evolve, driven currently by rapid advances in computing, mathematics, and network modeling, which will be essential to making complex systems comprehensible.",

            "text": "The earliest assays for large-scale transcriptional profiling consisted of cDNAs or oligonucleotides spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. These first \u201carrays\u201d have since been replaced by commercially available platforms in which tens of thousands of oligonucleotides are arrayed at high density on glass slides or other solid supports. (Protein microarrays and protein\u2013protein interaction profiling are discussed in Chapter 12, The Virus\u2013Host Interactome.) Yet even the wealth of information available through the use of microarrays cannot compare to the level of information obtained through the direct sequencing of RNA transcripts (RNA-seq). Next-generation sequencing, a sequencing-by-synthesis approach that has replaced the first-generation Sanger sequencing method, is capable of yielding a truly comprehensive view of the transcriptome (discussed in more detail in Section 6 of this chapter; Sidebar 2).Sidebar 2Microarrays\n\nDNA microarrays can trace their ancestry to the Southern blot, in which genomic DNA, digested into fragments by restriction enzymes, is immobilized on a permeable membrane filter for subsequent detection by labeled DNA hybridization. The Southern blot gave rise to the \u201creverse\u201d dot blot, in which synthetic oligonucleotides of known sequence (called probes) were immobilized on permeable membrane supports. The collection of DNA sequences to be analyzed (called targets) were then labeled and applied to the membrane under hybridization conditions. The use of permeable membranes, however, made it difficult to control the size and shapes of the spotted DNA and limited miniaturization. These limitations were overcome by the introduction of solid supports, which provided the ability to accurately control the size, shape, and location of the spots. The robotic spotting of cDNAs onto glass slides\u2014the first of what we now know as microarrays\u2014was pioneered by Patrick Brown at Stanford University (Schena et al., 1995). In an interview with Discover magazine, Brown explained that when he applied for a grant to develop the technology: \u201cThe microarray part was thoroughly rejected\u2026but I just decided that I would make one anyway.\u201d Importantly, the use of solid supports also facilitated the development of methods for the in situ synthesis of nucleic acids on the surface using approaches such as ink jet fabrication (spotting droplets of nucleotide reagents instead of droplets of ink) or photolithographic methods (similar to those used in the semiconductor industry). Today, major commercial providers of microarrays include Affymetrix, Agilent Technologies, Illumina, and NimbleGen, with platforms varying in the length of oligonucleotide used, the number of oligonucleotides representing each gene, and the methods used for oligonucleotide synthesis and attachment to solid supports. Microarray technology has also been adapted for the profiling of noncoding RNA expression, DNA methylation, and single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as for promoter analysis and the detection of genome-wide DNA copy number variation.",

However, the limited phenotypic parameters that can be studied using cultured cells\u2014viral replication or cytopathic effect\u2014makes it difficult to study viral pathogenesis. In contrast, with an animal model, it is possible to measure a variety of disease parameters\u2014e.g., virus yields, clinical signs, gross pathology, histopathology, and time to recovery or death\u2014and the cells or tissues that are examined come from their natural environment.

In all cases, it begins with the computational determination of genes that are differentially expressed between conditions (or time points) to a statistically significant degree. This information alone can yield important scientific insights. For example, transcriptional profiling of interferon-treated cultured cells, or tissues from whole animals, has been used to define the hundreds of genes that are induced by this innate immune cytokine, many of which are important players in the innate antiviral response.

            "text": "Similarly, transcriptional profiling of gene knockout cells or animals can be used to evaluate the role of specific genes in the host response to infection. These studies reveal both the changes in gene expression that occur as a result of the gene knockout as well as the effect of the knockout on the host response. Often, these studies also reveal the existence of compensatory signaling mechanisms, which can complicate data interpretation. A slight twist on this approach has been used to study Mx1, an interferon-induced gene that confers resistance to influenza virus infection. Mx1 is lacking in most laboratory strains of mice, and these animals are highly susceptible to many strains of influenza virus, including the reconstructed 1918 pandemic virus. Transcriptional profiling of the lungs of 1918 virus-infected wild-type BALB/c mice (which lack a functional Mx1), and knock-in mice carrying a functional Mx1, demonstrates profound differences in gene expression, which correlate with reduced mortality in Mx1\n+/+ mice (Cilloniz et al., 2012). Treatment of Mx1\n+/+ mice with interferon prior to infection increases survival to 100% and is associated with an increase in the expression of genes related to intercellular signaling or cellular movement and a decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes (Figure 1\n). Here, transcriptional profiling, attached to a relatively straightforward study design, yielded information on the function of Mx1 in mediating resistance to influenza virus and on the role of interferon signaling in this process.\n",

Once differentially expressed genes are identified, it is important to know the biological or biochemical function of their encoded products. For many genes, this information can be obtained from a variety of public (e.g., DAVID, maintained by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) or proprietary (e.g., Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) databases.

It is important to keep in mind, however, that many genes lack functional annotation or they are only poorly annotated. This means that considerable information may be lost if data analyses do not move beyond a survey of genes with already known function. Fortunately, one of the broader outcomes of transcriptional profiling studies should be an increase in functional annotation.

These genes remain highly expressed until the death of the animal. In contrast, animals infected with less-pathogenic viruses exhibit a rapid induction of interferon and innate immune response genes, a response that resolves over time as the animals recover. In macaques, the 1918 virus also induces a disproportionate induction of genes associated with the inflammasome, a group of genes that are thought to be part of a protective innate immune response to influenza viruses. Excessive activation of the inflammasome, however, appears to be detrimental rather than protective. In mice, highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses also down-regulate anti-inflammatory genes, including Alox5, responsible for the biogenesis of lipoxins, and Socs2, encoding a suppressor of cytokine signaling that can be induced by lipoxins to control the inflammatory response.

Using what is referred to as a top-down systems analysis approach (the breaking down of a complex system into finer details), transcriptional profiles were first obtained from whole lung and then from individual immune cell populations isolated from the lungs of mice infected with lethal or nonlethal influenza virus. Rather than focusing on specific gene expression changes, transcriptional data were organized into 50 modules consisting of genes with coordinate patterns of expression (Figure 2\n). A module of genes annotated as highly proinflammatory was uniquely associated with lethal infection. This inflammatory signature was shown to largely originate from neutrophils that rapidly migrate to the site of infection (which is poorly contained in the case of the lethal virus). The authors suggest that this initiates a chemokine-driven feed-forward pathway in which the first neutrophils at the scene release chemokines that attract additional neutrophils, resulting in a rapidly escalating inflammatory response and tissue damage. In support of this finding, attenuation of this self-amplifying process by experimental reduction (but not elimination) of neutrophil numbers increased survival without changing viral spread.",

In contrast, Asian monkeys, such as rhesus or pig-tail macaques, develop AIDS following SIV infection. Several independent transcriptional profiling studies have shown that natural hosts for SIV exhibit an innate immune response to the virus that is comparable to that exhibited by Asian macaques. Initial levels of viral replication are also comparable. However, in natural hosts the innate immune response is of limited duration, whereas in macaques the response is sustained (Figure 3\n) (Jacquelin et al., 2009).

The question remains as to why natural host species are able to resolve the initial response to SIV, whereas macaques (or most HIV-infected individuals) cannot. One hypothesis, proposed as the West Coast Model of immune activation, suggests that the kinetics of activation holds the key (Benecke et al., 2012). The West Coast Model likens virus infection to a wave on the beach, and immune activation as the mounting of a surf board. Mount too early or too late and bad things happen. If correct, the model has important implications for AIDS vaccine design as it suggests that the question of whether an adaptive immune response can be mounted against SIV (or HIV) could be irrelevant. Rather, it may be beneficial to devise strategies to modulate the timing or duration of the response, or to prevent chronic immune recognition of the virus. (Additional information on the kinetics of HIV and SIV infection and lessons learned from natural host species can be found in Chapter 9, HIV and AIDS)",

At that point, transplantation may be the only remaining treatment option.

This study revealed that within 3 months of transplantation over 400 genes were differentially expressed between progressors (who developed adverse clinical outcomes 4\u20137 years after transplantation) and nonprogressors. This included the down-regulation of genes associated with immune and inflammatory responses, cell cycle progression, and metabolic functions in patients who progressed to severe liver disease. A companion study identified a proteomic signature, indicative of oxidative stress, which could also distinguish progressors from nonprogressors (Diamond et al., 2012). Significantly, these studies showed that transcriptional or proteomic markers of disease progression can be detected prior to histological evidence of severe liver injury.

In all of these studies, follow-up validation using cell culture has demonstrated reductions in viral replication. However, it remains to be seen whether and how rapidly drugs (or classes of drugs) identified by this method actually make their way into clinical use.
