There have been 43 deaths so far.1, 2 The source of human infection appears to be poultry.1, 3, 4, 5 There is so far no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission within the community. Genetic analysis of these viruses revealed that all eight gene segments were of avian origin; six internal gene segments were derived from avian influenza A H9N2 viruses found in poultry in Asia, and the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes were derived from influenza viruses circulating in ducks and wild birds, respectively.1\n",

In the alveoli, H7N9-infected cells were mainly type II pneumocytes and macrophages. Type II alveolar epithelial cells are important in producing surfactant proteins A and D and are crucial in reconstituting damaged type I alveolar epithelium. Loss of type II pneumocytes would lead to impairment of the repair processes after alveolar damage. The tropism of Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 infection in the alveoli is similar to that seen with H5N1 infection,17 but the extent of infection of the bronchus and lung is significantly greater than that seen with H5N1.

            "text": "Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses differ in aminoacid residues Gln226Leu, Ser138Ala, and Gly186Val (H7/H3 numbering) in haemagglutinin, which are expected to enhance binding of Sh2/H7N9 to \u03b1-2,6 glycans found in the human upper airways.4 However, Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 infect human bronchus with similar efficiency. A sialidase specific for cleaving the \u03b1-2,3 glycosidic abolished the haemagglutination of turkey red blood cells by H5N1 virus, but did not affect haemagglutination by Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9 viruses suggesting that both Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 predominantly bind \u03b1-2,6 glycans, irrespective of differences in aminoacid residues Gln226Leu, Ser138Ala, and Gly186Val of haemagglutinin. Both Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 have lost a glycosylation site (Thy160Ala) in the 150-loop of haemagglutinin that is known to result in increased affinity for binding \u03b1-2,6-linked glycans in H5N1 viruses.4 By contrast, others have reported that a recombinant Sh2/H7N9-like virus haemagglutinin bound poorly to human trachea and a Gly228Ser aminoacid change was needed to confer improved binding to the human upper airways.18 Recombinant viral haemagglutinin might not accurately reflect haemagglutinin binding of native virions where multivalent trimeric haemagglutinin is present together with neuraminidase and fails to take into account any role that the virus neuraminidase (via the catalytic site or the second neuraminidase binding site) might have in virus binding. On the other hand, others have used labelled H7N9 to define virus binding to human respiratory tract tissues, indicating that both Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9-like viruses bind very efficiently to the human bronchus (T Kuiken, personal communication).",

Receptor binding and structural analysis of Sh2/H7N9-like virus haemagglutinin shows efficient binding of both \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 receptors.20 The functional changes in receptor binding and PB2 Glu627Lys are some of the key functional changes identified by Herfst and colleagues21 in 2012 to be important in adapting an avian H5N1 virus towards transmission in mammals. Since A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1) virus also has lysine at position 627 in PB2, the efficient replication of H7N9 viruses in human ex-vivo cultures of the bronchus is unlikely to be explained solely on this basis.",

However, autopsy data usually only provide information about lung pathology at late stages of the illness and thus fail to provide insights into virus tropism in the early stages of infection. Thus data from experimental infection of ex-vivo cultures of the respiratory tract provide unique insights into virus tropism and pathogenesis. Reported patients with H7N9 disease have been older than those with human infections with avian H5N1 or H9N2 viruses, and severe disease appears to be more common with increasing age.3 The biological basis for this unusual epidemiological pattern needs to be understood because it differs from that seen in individuals infected with H5N1. Whether milder cases in young people are unrecognised, thereby skewing the case\u2013fatality ratio as well as the age distribution, is unclear. Paediatric lung and bronchial tissues differ from adult tissues in the balance of sialylated \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 glycans,19 and this factor might contribute to the increased disease severity with increasing age. However, using similar techniques we found that Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses efficiently infected ex-vivo lung from a 1-year-old child (data not shown). Chronic lung disease increases numbers of type II pneumocytes (the target cells for influenza viruses) and might contribute to an increased disease severity compared with younger, healthier individuals.22\n",

Since ex-vivo cultures are heterogeneous in cell type and susceptibility to virus and the infecting dose cannot be precisely controlled, we chose to compare innate immune responses to H7N9 infection with that of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and H1N1pdm viruses in well defined primary human macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells. By comparison with H5N1 virus (a high cytokine-inducing virus) and H1N1pdm virus (a low cytokine-inducing virus), Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 appear to have an intermediate phenotype in their intrinsic capacity to induce proinflammatory cytokines such as CCL5 and TNF\u03b1. The expression of interferon stimulated genes (eg, MX1, ISG15) did not appear to be impaired. Lungs and serum of mice experimentally infected with Sh2/H7N9 also had lower concentrations of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines compared with those of H5N1-infected mice.23 In a patient with mild disease and one with severe disease in whom cytokine concentrations were studied, there was no difference in proinflammatory cytokines in serum. However, the patient who died had high serum concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokine serum interleukin 10.5 Raised plasma or lung cytokine concentration might be secondary to more severe pathology in severely ill patients,24 or secondary to increased replication competence of a virus rather than being the intrinsic cause of such pathology. Therefore, the experiments we have described in which similar virus infecting doses of different viruses are compared for their capacity for cytokine induction provides important data to define the intrinsic viral capacity for proinflammatory cytokine induction, which might be of relevance for pathogenesis and therapy. From our findings, Sh2/H7N9-like viruses appear to be intrinsically more potent inducers of the proinflammatory cytokine responses than are H1N1pdm viruses, but less so than H5N1 viruses. Thus, proinflammatory cytokine responses might contribute in part to the severity of human H7N9 disease, but the unusual tissue tropism of this virus for human bronchus and lung and attendant direct viral cytopathology probably has a more important role in pathogenesis, as was seen with the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.16\n",
