(+)ssRNA viruses package their genomes as messenger sense, single stranded RNA and replicate those genomes solely through RNA intermediates in the cytosol of the host cells 8 . RNA-dependent RNA polymerases lack co-and post-replicative fidelity-enhancing pathways, and final RNA genome copies incorporate mutations at a much higher rate than that observed for DNA genomes 9,10 providing the viral quasispecies a higher probability to evolve and adapt to new environments and challenges during infection 11,12 . The diversity is essential for both viral fitness and pathogenesis, due to the complex relationship between virus replication, host cells and immune system, since almost +RNA viruses can delay antiviral innate immune response 13 in multiple ways 14-20 . Host immunogenetic factors can be sensitive to a variation in the viral load, conveying to a defective response of the innate immunity that could explain the variable clinical course of infection 20,21 . Among (+)ssRNA viruses, h-CoVs have unusually large genomes (\u223c30 kb) associated with low mutation rates 20,22 . Three novel h-CoVs are etiological agents of serious viral interstitial pneumonia 23 . They include the severe acute respiratory syndrome, first described in Guandong province in China in 2002 24 , the Middle East respiratory syndrome (caused by MERS-CoV), emerged in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia and Qatar 25 , and the SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China in January 2020, cause of the largest outbreak in the modern history 23 .",

Symbols are borrowed from the energy language 51, 52 : shields indicate the stocks, big solid arrows the processes and line arrows the flows, whereas dashed lines indicate the controls exerted by the stocks on the processes. All stocks, flows and processes are expressed in terms of the energy embedded, transmitted and used during the infection. We used ATP-equivalents (ATP-eq) as energy unit 53 referred to cellular costs, by using the number of ATP (or GTP and other ATP-equivalents) hydrolysis events as a proxy for energetic cost 53, 54 . The dynamic determination of flows was based on the knowledge of characteristic time-scales of well-established biological processes (for more details see Supplementary Methods).

In the absence of virus, energy flows from Q1 (flows J1, J2A and J2B) to produce short-half-life proteins (stock Q2A) and long-half-life proteins (stock Q2B), whose synthesis, degradation and secretion follow dynamic stationary conditions. In particular, typical of the specialized cells such as those of the pulmonary epithelium, there is a flow of proteins destined for degradation and recycling through the recruitment of autophagic receptors or organelles or proteasomes (identified in the diagram by the flows J21A and J21B, Supplementary Methods Table   1 ).

In the configuration of initial null viral load (Q3 stock value=0) the value of stocks Q1, Q2A and Q2B were constant and the system behavior was stationary (Figure 2A) .

The combination of external driving forces acting on J5 and J21 did not result to be significantly synergic, while targeting J50 and J21 increased the Q5 stock value instead of the expected reduction. It is worth stressing that this kind of behavior is a typical systemic feature, where an intervention on a specific local process may lead to counterintuitive rearrangements in the system dynamics as a whole. Late suppression of J5 and J50 at Day 5 could reduce only the stock values of Q4. Only early full reduction of J5 (by Day 1) could significantly limit the growth of Q5, while the combination of contemporary suppression of J5 and J50 could not prevent Q5 growth (Figure 5) .",

Processes are any occurrence capable to alter -either quantitatively or qualitatively -a flow, by the action of one or more of the system elements. In a stationary state of the system, stocks values are either constant or regularly oscillating. In the dynamics of a system, stocks act as shock absorbers, buffers, and time-delayers. Processes are all what happens inside a system that allows the stationarity of its state, or that may perturb the state itself. To occur, a process must be activated by another driver, acting on the flow where the process is located.

The equations, that characterize the flows relevant to the diagram, are typical of dynamic ST analysis 51, 78 , and their setting up is linked in many respects to the energy network language 79 . In this approach, each flow depends on the state variables Qi by relationships of the kind dQi/dt=kf(Qj), i,j=1,...,n, where n is the number of stocks in the system. Given a set of proper initial conditions for the stocks (i.e., the initial system state) and a properly chosen set of phenomenological coefficients k, the set of interconnected equations will be treated by standard finite-different method, taking care of choosing a time-step short enough to evidence the possible dynamics of any of the studied processes. The coefficients ki are calculated using data on the dynamics of any single stock, in particular, by estimating the flows and the stocks during the time interval set for the simulation steps (as described in Supplementary Methods). When different flows co-participate in a process, a single coefficient will gather all the actions that concur to the intensity of the outcoming flow(s). These phenomenological coefficients are not, therefore, related to specific biophysical phenomena or processes, but are set to describe how and how fast any part of the system react to a change in any of the other ones. In general, our model may be then regarded as based on a population-level model (PLM) as defined by 80 , which can be run at different scales from organism to sub-cellular ones (see for example 58, 81, 82 ), that already increased the existing knowledge on the life cycle of different infections, like for example the ones generated by HIV and Hepatitis C virus 83 .

Progressive increase of initial viral load contained in Q3 and Q4 stocks interfers with the processes of the host cell, forcing host-proteins Q2B to favor the production of virions (progressive increase of the Q5 stock value) through increased J23, J25 and J27 flows (Figure 2B-F). Thus, the Q5 dynamic evolution is significantly dependent on the initial configuration (baseline amount of Q3, Q4, Q2B and cell bioenergetics, represented by J0 and baseline Q1 amount). This could favor virions spread to other cells and changing the system output, with a bulk release of the content of Q5 outside the cell. For a given Q1 basal amount (which represents a specific phase of cell cycle, since Q1 by definition is the amount of ATP-eq allocated for protein synthesis in the cell) and Q3 (equivalent to 10k virions infection), the configuration of the system should be therefore simulated at different time points. The behavior of Q1 following different initial values of Q3 could explain why infections due to hCoVs have a wide incubation time, and in most cases occur asymptomatic, since in half of the possible configurations no relevant changes in the host cell energetics were observed. This phenomenon can have clinical implications, providing a better understanding of the configurations that can favor the action of external driving forces (e.g., drugs).",

The amount of stocks Q2A and Q2B remained constant in all simulations, suggesting that the host-cell bioenergetics does not modify protein synthesis, that is used to feed viral protein synthesis as well.Full (100%) or partial (50%) reduction of J4 and J50 flows at day 0 did not affect the dynamics of the system(Extended Data Figures 3 A-E, B-F, D-H and Figure 3, respectively), suggesting that these are not good leverage points at this timepoint. On the contrary, external driving forces able to half flows J3 and J5 could induce progressive reduction of Q3, associated to increase in Q1(Figure 3).Full reduction of J5 at Day 0 can recover the systems dynamics in a stationary status (Extended Data Figure 3 C), while a partial reduction can only reduce at each timepoint the stock values of Q4 (Extended Data Figure 3 G) and Q5 (Figure 3).

In fact, the multiple interactions between virus RNA and host cells operate as a dynamic system, capable to overcome the action of external driving forces. This systemic behavior is a major obstacle in the understanding of how developing novel therapies66 . Infection works across a range of intertwined spatial and temporal (hours to days) scales 32 , suggesting that a description able to connect all the levels at which the infection proceeds is needed49 .The presence of a (+)ssRNA-virus stock within the system is one of the possible self-organized patterns (configurations) of a single cell. The virus-host co-evolution 67 was represented as an evolving pattern, to which the RNA-virus has given access, using pre-existing stocks, processes and flows of the host cell. Conversely, healthy host-cell dynamics can be represented through a transient stationary state of relevant stocks (i.e., Q1, Q2A and Q2B). The use of energy as key parameter in modelling the virus-host co-evolution, at the level of the single cell, complies with the medical literature evidence, showing the relevance of energy as a descriptor of biosystems in medicine[68][69][70][71] .Addressing the requirement of a poly-target approach72 , our work implemented the description of virus energetics, previously given in terms of predicted energy use in different steps of the viral evolution 53,73 .

The latter is related to the completeness and the correctness of the relationships between the stocks, i.e., the setting up of the equations that represent the matter flows as well as the control actions that the stocks exert on processes. A single comprehensive procedure for the of validation of all dynamic models however does not exist85 , since the validity of a well-made model is anyway dependent also on its usefulness, referred to the very purpose of the model itself. Knowledge in the field must guide the setting up of the model, in order to legitimate the choice of the elements that form the systemic simulator (see Supplementary Materials for further details). This was done using both information from existing knowledge on the biological mechanisms at issue, and experimentbased calculations, that allow to the identification of the variables and parameters necessary to set up the equations describing the system dynamics. This evaluation procedure encompasses both the static features and the dynamics of the system. In our case, the first fundamental test was the verification of the prediction of a stationary state for the values of the stocks of the system in the absence of contagion, i.e., when no competition is occurring between virus and the host. The model itself was set up by an iterative process, in which the scientific medical knowledge about the virus was used to draw a first model, then converted to a simulator, refined and integrated by testing its ability to simulate real data and the actual evolution of the disease under different conditions. The reliability of both available data and modelling were tested by evaluating the variation of the model output upon \"artificial\" changes of each of the most relevant input data. Some of these numbers are affected by relatively high uncertainties. Thus, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the outcome of the simulations, testing to what extent a possible variation on these values lead to incorrect evaluation of the system dynamics. For this reason, we applied a 50% variation (either positive or negative), in different combinations, to the parameters on which the results are more sensitive. As expected, the corresponding simulations vary as well, but the general dynamics of any of them resulted unchanged, especially concerning the overall trends shown by comparing the groups of simulation, as in the figures presented in this work.
