However, the drawer at the nurse station had a positive detection, mainly because the nurses often went in and out to care for the patients. In this process, the virus would could have been brought to the nurses\u2019 station. In addition, we were not surprised by the positive detection in the treatment room. The treatment room was a place where patients additional treatments, and the virus load may have been too high to completely eliminate by routine disinfection.
