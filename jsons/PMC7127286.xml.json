            "text": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive and often severe muscle weakness and atrophy and is a leading cause of death in infants [1], [2], [3], [4]. SMA is caused by homozygous deletions (\u223c95% of SMA patients) or compound heterozygous mutations (\u223c5% of SMA patients) in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that prevent production of full-length functional SMN protein [5]. The paralogous gene SMN2 undergoes aberrant splicing and produces mostly truncated, dysfunctional protein (\u223c90%) [1]. Symptom onset most often occurs in infancy and early childhood, although onset can be in adulthood in the mildest form. Symptoms are generally more severe with earlier onset [1]. Most individuals who develop SMA have a symptom-free period after birth, which differs in duration for every individual. SMA is divided into four major subtypes based on age at symptom onset and maximum motor function achieved [1,6,7], but maximum motor function achievement can be influenced by SMA treatment. Many infants with infantile-onset SMA and children with later-onset SMA treated with nusinersen in the ENDEAR and CHERISH studies, respectively, achieved motor function incongruent with their expected SMA subtypes based on SMN2 copy number and age of symptom onset [8,9].",

SMN2 gene copy number is roughly correlated with disease severity, as an increased number of SMN2 gene copies typically leads to an increased amount of functional SMN protein and a milder phenotype [1]. Among individuals who have SMN1 disruptions and are therefore expected to develop SMA symptoms, approximately 75% of individuals with two copies of the SMN2 gene are predicted to develop the Type I form of SMA, while approximately 80% of those with three copies of the SMN2 gene are predicted to develop SMA Type II [10,11]. Additionally, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) levels have recently been shown to be a promising biomarker of disease activity and treatment response in individuals with SMA [12,13]. pNF-H is a neuron-specific cytoskeletal structural protein released into the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during axonal damage [14,15]. In the ENDEAR and CHERISH studies, concentrations of pNF-H were found to correlate with baseline clinical characteristics indicative of disease severity. Furthermore, pNF-H concentrations declined rapidly then stabilized at a lower level following nusinersen treatment in a manner not seen in the sham control group [13].",

In clinical studies in a range of symptomatic children across several SMA populations, nusinersen demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefit as assessed by achievement of motor milestones, measures of motor function, and survival in those with infantile-onset SMA, along with a favorable safety profile [8,9,25]. Importantly, subgroup analyses of the sham-controlled studies in infantile-onset (ENDEAR) and later-onset (CHERISH) SMA indicated that greater improvements in motor function following nusinersen treatment were observed in those with relatively shorter disease duration at treatment initiation [8,9], suggesting that earlier treatment may lead to better clinical outcomes.",

HINE-2 measures developmental progress in eight motor milestones: voluntary grasp, ability to kick in supine position, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking. Total scores range from 0 to 26, with higher scores indicating better motor function [29]. The HINE-2 score was assessed until Day 778.

The associations between Day 64 weight for age or Day 64 CMAP amplitude and achievement of WHO walking alone are shown in Supplementary Figs. 3(A) and 3(B).",

The results of this interim analysis, representing a median 2.9 years of follow up, demonstrate substantial clinical benefit in infants with two or three copies of the SMN2 gene (considered most likely to develop Type I or II SMA) as a result of early initiation of nusinersen treatment. NURTURE infants, who at the time of this interim analysis were age \u226525 months and past the age of symptom onset [3,27], were all alive without requirement for permanent ventilation. The contrast to the natural history of untreated SMA is dramatic: those with SMA Type I (the expected phenotype for approximately half our cohort based on SMN2 copy number) die or require permanent ventilation, on average, by 13.5 months of age [27]. That early treatment is key to this rescue arises from comparison of the NURTURE experience with that of the ENDEAR study, in which treatment with nusinersen was initiated in a symptomatic period. By the end of the ENDEAR study, 31/80 (39%) nusinersen-treated infants with infantile-onset SMA died or required permanent ventilation [8]. All NURTURE participants are alive without permanent ventilation and able to sit independently; nearly all children (23/25) can walk with assistance or independently, and all continued to gain motor skills throughout the study interval. In both groups of children with two and three SMN2 copies, nusinersen showed rapid onset of improvement and durability of effect on mean CHOP INTEND motor function scores. These results are clearly incongruent with the natural history of individuals with two or three copies of SMN2\n[6]. These results demonstrate that treatment with nusinersen of genetically diagnosed infants with SMA in the presymptomatic period allows for gains in motor function closer to normal development than that expected in individuals with SMA Type I or II.",

Population-based newborn screening (NBS) is a method for identifying presymptomatic individuals with treatable diseases that aims to provide the opportunity for early intervention [16]. In the United States, NBS for homozygous deletion of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening panel (RUSP) on July 16th, 2018. Other NBS programs are in development globally [17], [18], [19], [20]. Presymptomatic individuals with SMA are now being identified in several US states through NBS programs, and many additional states will begin screening later in 2019. Additional NBS efforts for SMA are ongoing globally and are supported by the general population in several countries [17], [18], [19],38,39]. A treatment algorithm based on SMN2 copy number for SMA positive infants identified though NBS was recently developed by a group of SMA experts [40]. The recommendation was for infants with two or three SMN2 copies to receive immediate treatment following confirmatory testing. An additional recommendation by other SMA experts suggests immediate treatment for presymptomatic infants with up to four SMN2 copies [41]. NURTURE results support immediate treatment of infants with two or three SMN2 copies and support the notion that earlier treatment across the spectrum improves eventual outcome as was demonstrated by the ENDEAR and CHERISH studies [8,9].",

Concentrations of pNF-H in both the ENDEAR and CHERISH studies were found to correlate with several baseline clinical characteristics indicative of disease severity and decline rapidly after treatment with nusinersen before stabilizing at lower plateau levels [13]. To our knowledge, NURTURE is the first study to evaluate pNF-H levels in a presymptomatic SMA population. Geometric mean plasma and CSF levels of pNF-H were substantially higher in NURTURE participants than in infants without SMA and, within NURTURE participants, plasma and CSF pNF-H levels were significantly higher in participants with two versus three SMN2 copies. After nusinersen treatment initiation, pNF-H levels declined rapidly during the loading period before apparently stabilizing at lower levels. The rapid decline of pNF-H levels suggests the value of pNF-H as a potential biomarker of treatment response to SMN-enhancing therapies. Levels of pNF-H in plasma at the end of the nusinersen loading dose period may predict future motor function such as walking alone by the WHO 99th percentile for expected age of achievement.",

In either case, pre-treatment elevation of pNF-H levels in these presymptomatic infants further emphasizes the value of NBS initiatives worldwide and stress the importance of proactive intervention in the presymptomatic phase of SMA, consistent with other chronic progressive neurological diseases [42], [43], [44], [45].",

While several participants had untreated siblings with SMA that allowed for the comparison of motor function achievement with natural history, formal assessments were not performed in the siblings with SMA, and the study has no sham-control group. It should be noted that infants had variable presentation across clinical measures at baseline (notably tendon reflexes, ulnar CMAP, and CHOP-INTEND). However, although there is no uniformly established definition of SMA symptom onset, all infants met the entry criteria and were considered presymptomatic at enrollment according to the investigator. CHOP INTEND score was assessed until a participant achieved the maximum score of 64, after which time it was no longer assessed, but a ceiling effect of the CHOP INTEND score was apparent at a score of approximately 60. HINE-2 score was assessed until Day 778 but was not assessed at later study visits. Additionally, comparisons of changes in CHOP INTEND and HINE-2 scores over time across the nusinersen clinical development program must be made cautiously; differences in study populations and study designs should be taken into consideration when interpreting the data. Caregiver-reported versus study visit documentation of achievement of motor milestones could lead to variation in the reported timing of achievements. Additionally, time of follow-up varies among participants, and first achievement of motor milestones may occur between study visits where these are assessed and documented.",

In this interim analysis, many infants and children treated during the presymptomatic period achieved motor milestones in timelines consistent with normal development. Data demonstrate durability of effect over a median of 2.9 years of follow up, with children continuing to make progress throughout the study with no evidence of sustained regression. These results not only exceed expectations based on the natural history of SMA and the phenotypes of participants\u2019 siblings with SMA, but also represent treatment benefits exceeding those observed when treatment is initiated in a symptomatic period. Additionally, pNF-H data from NURTURE demonstrate that the underlying SMA disease is biologically active in the presymptomatic period and merits treatment. Results from NURTURE strongly emphasize the need for early identification of infants with SMA through NBS and support the value of treatment initiation in presymptomatic infants, genetically diagnosed with SMA with two or three copies of the SMN2 gene, immediately after SMA diagnosis. This conclusion is consistent with current recommendations [40,41].",
