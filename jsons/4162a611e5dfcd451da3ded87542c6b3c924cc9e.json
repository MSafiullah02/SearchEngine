Indeed, in the context of the current covid19 pandemic, and lack of therapies specific for the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), antimicrobial coatings in healthcare settings could potentially lower the risk of transmission inside healthcare settings and protect both healthcare personnel and patients. Studies with SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related human coronavirus 229E have shown survival for 4-5 days on various surface materials including stainless steel, glass, plastics and ceramics but demonstrate rapid inactivation on copper alloys (8, 9) .",

Do AMCs cost more (they are unlikely to cost less)? Are AMC effects durable and do they persist? Are there training implications for hospital staff? Does cleaning have an effect on the AMCs? Does the presence of an AMC have an effect on the effectiveness of cleaning solutions? What environmental monitoring is needed? Do AMCs work? Do AMCs prevent infections? Is the cost of their use less than the cost of treatment? Do AMCs contribute to AMR? \u2022 For industry, the cost of bringing an AMC successfully to market successfully is significant. To fail to reach the market, or simply to not be successful in the market, can result in commercial disaster. \u2022 For regulators, credible blinded, controlled proof of use in situ is scarce, and the impact (positive and negative) on AMR remain undefined.

To fail to provide these will hinder availability of AMCs for use in healthcare and public places. However, to some degree, this need will now be met through 2020 CIG-15114: \"ePlatform for a \"test bed\" tool across the EU for antimicrobial coating solutions in health care entering to the market\".
