While the world collectively shelters in place to protect against coronavirus, medical professionals flock to the front lines to work tirelessly tending to a burgeoning number of infected people. Countless medical professionals throughout the globe are putting in extra hours and strength to help people suffering from Covid-19.",

Due to the tightness of protective equipment, sweat evaporation is blocked, resulting in wet humid skin. After the skin is stimulated by moisture, the skin surface is weakly acidic and damaged, weakening the barrier functions. . 3 It is easily susceptible to external forces such as friction and pressure damage. 3 Device-related pressure injuries mostly occur in areas with less adipose tissue such as forehead, bridge of the nose and cheek. 4",
