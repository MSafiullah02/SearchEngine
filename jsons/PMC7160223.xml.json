Because the intimate relationship between blood pressure and flow, operational definitions of shock include the fall of mean (MAP) and/or systolic arterial pressure (SAP) [1, 2]. Nevertheless, alterations of pulse wave could grossly mirror, in some extend, the underlying mechanisms of acute circulatory failure implied in shock. For example, SAP results particularly important to define cardiogenic shock [2], hemorrhagic [3] or any type of shock with a hypovolemic component, since at very early stage of these conditions, SAP and pulse pressure (PP) fall while diastolic arterial pressure tends to be sustained. However, hypotension observed during septic shock results from a complex interaction between vasodilation, relative and absolute hypovolemia, myocardial dysfunction, and altered blood flow distribution [4]. In particular, vasodilation resulting from the failure of the vascular smooth muscle to constrict is one of the leading mechanisms associated with hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion in septic shock [5]. In these cases, diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) would better reflect vasodilation than SAP or MAP.",

Thus, detection of low DAP at peripheral vessels should reflect systemic vasodilation as long as aortic valve is competent. However, in general, DAP is not considered for definition of septic shock, and with few exceptions, its relationship with clinical outcomes has not been widely described [7]. Important studies in patients with septic shock define hypotension in terms of MAP and SAP values [8\u201310] assuming the pivotal role of MAP [11] or SAP, on organ perfusion [12\u201314], in addition to the prognostic value of sustained low MAP values [15]. Nevertheless, evaluation of the loss of vascular tone through the severity of diastolic hypotension could have profound implications on therapeutic decisions since there are not robust clues to rapidly predict when hypotension will be sustainably corrected with fluid loading. Thus, rapid assessment of severity of vasodilation could influence therapeutic decisions such as the early introduction of vasoactive agents [16], which theoretically would avoid unnecessary fluid administration while promptly restoring tissue perfusion.",

            "text": "Remarkably, DAP should not be evaluated separately from heart rate. Acute reductions in arterial pressure are compensated by increased sympathetic activity, although sometimes such compensation becomes maladaptive. This was the original rationale to indexing SAP by heart rate (HR) during hemorrhagic shock and acute critical illness [17, 18], or indexing MAP by HR to detect myocardial hypoperfusion [19]. Likewise, as DAP depends on vascular tone and the duration of the cardiac cycle [20], a combination of DAP and HR could reflect the severity of circulatory dysfunction during vasodilatory conditions. Thus, we evaluated the relationships between very early HR:DAP ratios (i.e., the diastolic shock index, or DSI, calculated just before or at the start of vasopressor support) and clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock, hypothesizing that very early DSI values could promptly identify patients at high risk of unfavorable outcomes, while persistence of high DSI during the first hours of resuscitation could reflect more severe cardiovascular dysfunction.",

Then, DSI was subsequently calculated 2, 4, and 8 h after the introduction of vasopressor support in both populations. Time elapsed from the first hypotension episode and the first fluid load with resuscitative intention was registered in the preliminary cohort, while time elapsed from the diagnosis of septic shock up to randomization was recorded for the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK population. Most of the initial measurements (i.e., pre-vasopressor and at the start of vasopressor) were obtained by non-invasive techniques using an oscillometric brachial cuff, typically in those patients admitted from the emergency room and general wards. However, invasive pressures were registered later on, when an indwelling intra-arterial catheter was placed. The volume of resuscitation fluids was registered at Pre-VPs point, and then, 2, 4 and 8 h after in the preliminary cohort, and at the VPs/DSI point, and 8 h after in the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK population. Meanwhile, net fluid balance was recorded at 8 and 24 h after the start of vasopressors in both populations. The HR-to-SAP ratio [18, 25] was also calculated at same time points. Multiple organ dysfunction was assessed using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA) [26], while ventilator-free days and requirement of acute renal replacement therapy were also registered.",

Then, new partitions were performed aiming to evaluate the effect of individual components of Pre-VPs/DSI or VPs/DSI (i.e., DAP and HR) on the relative risk of death, as follows: (a) into quintiles of progressively higher DAP; (b) into quintiles of progressively higher HR; (c) re-stratifying each original quintile of DAP into 5 sub-clusters of DSI to extract patients with similar DSI values and therefore, simultaneous increasing of HR and DAP.",

DAP reflects in part the vascular tone when aortic valve is competent. Nevertheless, the duration of the cardiac cycle, the blood volume ejected to the aorta and the arterial compliance also influence DAP [20]. Thus, under isovolemic conditions and constant arterial compliance, shortening diastolic times are associated with higher DAP while a prolonged diastole leads to an opposite effect [20]. Consequently, simultaneous and opposite variations in DAP and HR could suggest more severe cardiovascular dysfunction, with progressively high HR unable to compensate DAP drops as a consequence of gradual decrease in vascular tone. Supporting this, our data suggest that such progressively opposite changes in HR and DAP represent more severe circulatory dysfunction with proportional increases in the relative risk of death.",

Nevertheless, isolated DAP or HR just before or at start of vasopressors was not clearly related with mortality in the preliminary cohort and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK populations. Indeed, at similar HR or DAP values, the risk of death was increased only when DSI concomitantly increased (Figs. 2, 3; Additional file 1: Figure S2). In addition, MAP, SAP and \u201csystolic shock index\u201d (or, HR:SAP ratio) were not related with mortality in both populations (Additional file 1: Figures S8, S9). We hypothesized that although MAP and SAP are used to operatively define septic and another types of shock, initial MAP or SAP does not reflect systemic vasodilation, which is a leading mechanism in septic shock.

Patients in the higher quintiles of pre-VPs/DSI and VPs/DSI required more renal replacement therapy, depicted higher lactate values and also showed slower lactate decreases over the first 8 h of resuscitation. They also required significantly more resuscitation fluids and higher doses of vasopressors as reflected by the product of DSI and dose of norepinephrine (DSI*NE.dose). We hypothesize that persistently higher DSI values reflect a lack of vascular tone requiring progressively higher doses of vasopressors with an inadequate restoration of tissue perfusion. However, the observational nature of our study hinders the direct effect of variations in vasopressor dose or fluid loading on the DSI since the resuscitation maneuvers in each group were guided targeting MAP but not DAP.",

Although some disagreement in systolic or mean arterial pressure is observed from the ascending aorta to the peripheral vessels, DAP remains almost constant [6, 34], even during experimental endotoxemic conditions in which a \u201cvascular tone decoupling\u201d from central-to-peripheral circulation can occur [35]. Thus, DAP records obtained at peripheral circulation closely reflect central DAP measurements even during severe inflammatory conditions with increased vasodilation and altered arterial compliance. Although it could be argued that invasive vs. non-invasive measurement methods to measure arterial pressure could influence our results, the bias for DAP measurements is far lower than that observed for SAP [36]. Furthermore, although significant differences in SAP or MAP are observed according to if invasive vs. non-invasive method are used [36], DAP recordings are closer at progressively lower DAP values [35]. Consequently, all these considerations claim against the introduction of considerable errors in DSI calculation when using invasive vs. non-invasive DAP values and also favor the notion of DSI as a global marker of decreased vascular tone since DAP is less influenced by the reflection of pulse waves.",

            "text": "This study may have some important clinical implications. It is unlikely that severe hypotension as a result of severe vasodilation could be reversed by simple fluid administration and instead, unnecessary fluids with subsequent harmful accumulation can occur [37, 38]. Although also considered as \u201cfirst line intervention\u201d, vasopressors are usually used as a rescue therapy when initial fluid administration fails to correct hypotension or when arterial pressure is judged to be insufficient to ensure an adequate tissue perfusion. Recent experimental and observational data suggest that very early start of vasopressor support could be beneficial [27, 39]. Nevertheless, there are no clear signals indicating when vasopressor support should be started. In this way, very early signals of severe vasodilation should alert on its possible immediate requirement. Thus, DSI should not be interpreted as \u201canother index of death\u201d. Instead, a higher DSI value at presentation of severe cases of sepsis could identify patients who might benefit from some very early interventions capable of modifying the course of septic shock. Our data suggest some beneficial of very early start of vasopressors in patients at the higher pre-VPs DSI. Nevertheless, sample size and the retrospective nature of such observation simply pose a hypothesis to be tested in the future.",

First, as previously mentioned, its retrospective nature might limit the conclusions since some confounding factors and potential bias may not have been controlled. Nevertheless, observations from preliminary cohort, corroborated in prospectively collected data from a recent randomized controlled trial, reinforce the strength of DSI as an early identifier of septic patients at high risk of death. Second, we did not include a control group of normal subjects, so recognizing a DSI cutoff to identify abnormality could be misleading. Third, although persistently high DSI values were consistently observed in non-survivors in both the preliminary and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK groups, there are no clues about whether it is possible to intervene DSI course or even whether modifying DSI course might influence clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, this could be an important research question as recent experimental observations suggest that some early therapeutic interventions might modify the time-course of cardiovascular dysfunction in septic shock. Finally, despite the apparent plausibility of DSI at very early stages of septic shock, our observations are limited to a relative small sample of patients. Consequently, the potential utility of DSI in the clinical practice should be additionally explored.",
