As a hospital based in London, an epicentre of infection, it was clear that the organisation would rapidly need to respond to the crisis. The overarching premise of this response was that the Trust would move to providing emergency sight- or life-threatening (ocular oncology) care only from March 23rd 2020.",

Intravitreal injections would be continued at all sites that remained open in recognition of the increased risk and burden of travel on the elderly population that were the majority users of the service. Emergency or urgent surgery would only be continued at the central site and all closed units would be required to redirect appropriate patients to the nearest centre.",

Although it is possible that the rate of ocular trauma and retinal detachment is actually reduced due to inactivity during isolation, one can also infer that reduced presentation represents concerns regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19, particularly in a perceived high-risk environment such as a hospital. It may also reflect poor awareness of how to access ophthalmic care, many patients are familiar with initially seeking advice from an optometrist or GP. The closure of most optometry practices has limited access to ophthalmic advice.
