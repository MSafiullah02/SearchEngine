            "text": "A pandemic of acute respiratory illness has shocked the world. Initially reported from Wuhan province, China in Dec 2019, currently, the viral illness is rapidly spreading across the globe. The virus spreads by droplet transmission, contact with infected case or contact with contaminated fomites. The disease was first recognized after a cluster of pneumonia outbreak was reported in late December 2019 from Wuhan China. A new, human coronavirus (HCoV) was isolated from these cases and identified as a betacoronavirus and provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) using next-generation sequencing technology (1,2). On 11 Feb 2020, the International Committee on taxonomy of Viruses named the virus as \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d (SARS-CoV2) and World Health Organisation announced COVID-19, the name of the new disease caused by it. Many authors have studied the genome sequences of the circulating virus to understand the viral dynamics and the way this new strain has made its way into the human population and lead to the current pandemic. Speculations considering it a laboratory constructed or bioengineered virus have also emerged. Studies to suggest that it natural evolved from its existing ancestors in zoonotic reservoirs of have also been published.(3) However the research to establish the real origin of SARS-CoV2, is still underway.",

Coronaviruses also have a potential for interspecies transmission which can also cause zoonotic outbreaks. (11) Studies have suggested a bat origin of the HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. HCoV-229E have originated from bats with camelids acting as intermediate hosts. (13, 14, 15, 16) Molecular evolutionary analysis of HCoV-OC43 isolates suggests Bovine CoV (BCoV) is their genetically closest counterpart compared with other CoV species (17,18) A high similarity was observed between BCoV, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) (12) The evolution of HCoV-OC43 has been shown to be by recombinant events.(12) However the origin of CoV HKU1 is currently unknown (18) Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus. The homology modelling by the authors derived that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain (RBD) structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues and the ability of the virus to bind to the Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in humans.(19).",

Their study showed that 2019-nCoV was related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank accession number MG 772933) and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (MG772934) and more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%) (20) However their study also revealed that S gene of 2019-nCoV had the lowest sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, at only around 75% (20) Zhou P et al demonstrated that the novel virus has 96.2% similarity to a bat SARS-related Coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13 (MN996532.1)) (21). Zhang T et al showed that Pangolin CoV genes shower higher amino acid sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13 genes which included orf1b, spike protein(97.5% nucleotide identity), orf7a and orf10. The S1 protein which contains the RBD, is phylogenetically closer to pangolin-CoV than RaTG13 and this RBD region within the S1 was found to be conserved between Pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV2. The CoV spike (S) protein consisting of 2 subunits (S1 and S2), mediates infection of receptor-expressing host cells and the similarity between S1 protein of pangolin CoV to SARS-CoV2 points potential similarity in their pathogenic properties. (22) Though the origin of the SARS-CoV 2 is still a debatable topic but the recognition of the intermediate animal host is the crucial step in preventing further dissemination, future outbreaks and blocking the interspecies transmission.",

SARS-CoV-2 has RBD that has high affinity to ACE2 from humans, ferrets, cats and other species with high receptor homology 21 The receptor binding domain in SARS-CoV2 is different from that of SARS-CoV and the binding of SARS-CoV2 is not optimal based on computational analysis leading to the understanding that there is another mechanism of binding which has arisen out of natural selection of the virus in the human or human like ACE2. (3) The other salient finding of that study noted is the presence of a polybasic cleavage site at the junction of S1 and S2, though the role of this is not well established, may allow better cell to cell fusion without affecting viral entry 3,23,24.",

(25)The author analysed 103 SARS-CoV-2 virus strains and found that 101 showed complete linkage between the two SNPs: 72 strains exhibited a \u201cCT\u201d haplotype (defined as \u201cL\u201d type because T28,144 is in the codon of Leucine) and 29 strains exhibited a \u201cTC\u201d haplotype (defined as \u201cS\u201d type because C28,144 is in the codon of Serine) at these two sites. Thus the author proceeded to characterise and categorize the SARS-CoV-2 viruses into two major types, with L being the major type (\u223c70%) and S being the minor type (\u223c30%). Multiple sequence alignment in MEGA 7 of amino acid sequences of ORF 8 protein gene of 26 circulating strains from various locations around the globe to look for the frequency of the CT haplotype against the TC haplotype at position 84 was carried out. Our findings show that 11 out of 26 randomly selected strains showed Serine and 15 showed Leucine at position 84 of ORF 8(57.69%). Fig 3\n.",

The similarity of whole genome sequence of SARS CoV2 to pangolins is only 92% and 96.2% similarity to a bat SARS-related Coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13) which is insufficient to prove beyond doubt that these are the source of the virus.

Based on the available literature and ongoing research, it is interesting to see that the more virulent forms (SARS-CoV,MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2) get adapted to humans at some point in time of their evolution and this moment is crucial to the transmission of these viruses to humans. The SARS-CoV 2 appears to have originated in bats and the intermediate host could be pangolins, however it is difficult at this point in time to confidently determine the zoonotic source. Once they enter the human population, it is only a matter of time after which the morbidity and mortality caused by these viruses reach pandemic levels.
