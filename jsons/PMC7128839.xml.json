The gathering took place amid tight security with fever-detecting thermal cameras scanning people to ensure that they did not have severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Beyond these cameras, however, there was practically no significant discussion of public health security interests in the forum. The issue of terrorism and North Korea dominated the debates. The proceedings failed to explicitly recognise an imminent threat to the security and prosperity of the region: the microbial killers.",

The HIV epidemic also poses challenge to the burden of tuberculosis in the region.7 There were an estimated 1\u20138 million deaths from tuberculosis in 2000 globally, of which 12% were attributable to HIV. The number of people co-infected with tuberculosis and HIV in Asia exceeds two million. Moreover, the spread of HIV into parts of Asia fuel the number of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis cases. Although these diseases do not generate as much fear and panic as SARS, they result in far greater actual human morbidity and mortality, and in significant long-term economic and social erosion.8 The spread of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS throughout significantly affected societies can be compared to the effect of a slow acting neutron bomb that eliminates a substantial proportion of the population while leaving the infrastructure intact. These lethal infections are true weapons of mass destruction.",

The scope of the definition must transcend traditional concept of security and take into account non-military dimensions. The aforementioned security conference could have been an excellent opportunity for this. Fortunately, there are still other promising avenues. Public health security at the global level is gaining ground, and part of this progress can be attributed to the recent landmark report of the Commission on Human Security.9 The human security concept championed by the commission shifts current thinking by broadening the focus from the state to the security of people. The analysis on health and human security highlighted global infectious diseases as critical and pervasive threats to survival, livelihood, and dignity. Control of these microbial threats is considered both essential and instrumental to achieving human security. This report could help energise regional public health security initiatives if appropriately harnessed.",

The common strategy hammered out by east Asian leaders for SARS with commitment for information sharing could serve as a platform for a regional network of communicable disease surveillance.10 Evolving regional integration initiatives provide further opportunities for putting infectious diseases on the agenda. The East Asia Vision Group report,11 which proposed strategic directions for integration, noted infectious disease control as an important element. The embryonic form of the envisaged east Asian community, the Association of South East Asian Nations, has also showed signs of embracing the human security approach.12 These patches of global and regional initiatives need to be consciously woven into the tapestry of an east Asian security framework that reconciles security and public health policy. This framework could lead to a highly effective response to the contemporary threats to human security in the region.",
