Originating at the location of each SARI case (geocoded according to self-reported home address at the time of SARI illness onset) the statistic applies a likelihood function to cylindrical spatiotemporal scanning windows with dimensions of increasing distance and time period, each of which represents a potential cluster [15]. Using Monte Carlo hypothesis testing, the statistic compares expected versus observed case counts inside and outside the scan windows to detect clusters that are least likely to have occurred by chance [15]. Expected case counts are determined using data aggregated across the entire data set, both before and after the detected cluster [15]. The maximum spatial and temporal event magnitudes were set as 30 kilometers and 60 days, respectively. Clusters were considered significant at P \u2264 .05.

Using a library of approximately 2 million 50-mer to 100-mer nucleotide-soluble biotinylated probes that cover genomes of all 207 known vertebrate viral taxa, VirCapSeq-VERT positively selects and enriches viral sequences for high-throughput sequencing via probe hybridization [16]. Briefly, following nucleic acid extraction, sequencing libraries were prepared by including the viral sequence capture step within the standard KAPA protocol [16]. Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina) and resulted in an average of 400 million reads per lane. Host-filtered reads were assembled de novo using the MIRA assembler (version 4.0); contigs and unique singletons were subjected to homology search using MegaBlast against the GenBank nucleotide database. Sequences that showed poor or no homology at the nucleotide level were screened by BLASTX against the viral GenBank protein database. Based on the identified contigs, GenBank sequences were downloaded and used for mapping the whole data set to recover partial or complete genomes. Phylogenetic analyses were done using Mega7 (version 7.0) [17]. Additional methodologic detail is included in the Supplementary Material.",

Phylogenetic analysis, based on a 451-nucleotide fragment of the nucleocapsid gene (coordinates 1126\u20131574, accession number NC001498), revealed that sequences from 13 cases were consistent with genotype B3, the genotype endemic in East Africa [18]. Five samples contained measles virus genotype D4 that was thought to have been eliminated from East Africa in 2009 [18]. The 5 D4 samples were identical (100% nucleotide homology) to sequences identified during a measles outbreak in Manchester, England, in 2011 (GenBank accession number, KT732227) [19]. Epidemiologic investigations revealed that a 35 year-old, unvaccinated British tourist had traveled to the central region of Uganda in January 2012 shortly after developing a febrile illness with rash. This individual was found to have measles infection associated with genotype D4 upon return to England (Dr. Bakamutumaho, personal communication).",

However, these platforms have been challenged by limitations in sensitivity of pathogen sequencing in real-world clinical samples with highly abundant host and limited microbiological genetic material [16, 23]. Using a novel, minimally biased oligonucleotide probe capture system to positively select and enrich viral sequences among clinical samples, we detected respiratory viruses in nearly 82% of cases and viral coinfection in over 50% of cases [16]. Although pathogens associated with many clusters (human rhinovirus, RSV, and HPIV) could have been detected using multiplexed PCR platforms, use of VirCapSeq-VERT resulted in detection of highly contagious yet vaccine-preventable pathogens (measles, rubella) that would not have been detected using more biased diagnostics. Given advantages in detection yield and impactful genomic analyses, VirCapSeq-VERT should be a powerful molecular tool for global virologic surveillance moving forward. Considering ease-of-use (inclusion of viral sequence capture in standard library preparation and nucleic acid enrichment protocols) and sample cost ($40 in a 20-plex sample format), scalability to national reference laboratories in low-income settings is also realistic [16].",

First, our study, which should be viewed as proof-of-concept, was conducted retrospectively using previously collected surveillance data and laboratory samples. Although our spatiotemporal strategy has shown similar promise to enhance infectious disease surveillance in high- and low-income settings, future studies are needed to assess the real-time performance of our approach in the context of prospective surveillance in a low-income setting [35\u201337]. Second, our viral detection strategy relied on upper respiratory tract samples that may reflect carriage and not lower respiratory tract infection. Third, we did not sequence samples from cases occurring outside of spatiotemporally defined clusters. Thus, we cannot compare the frequency and characteristics of viruses in nonclustered participants, which may be similar to those detected using our sampling approach. Fourth, our cluster detection strategy targeting noninfluenza associated SARI was limited by the parameters of our spatiotemporal modeling methods. As most clusters lacked a dominant circulating virus, our approach may have lacked specificity to detect clusters associated with a single circulating pathogen. It is also possible that increased SARI incidence within clusters may have been driven by environmental or epidemiologic factors independent of pathogen transmission. Further work is needed to identify alternative spatiotemporal surveillance strategies that may provide greater pathogen specificity, both for influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses. Finally, our clinical outcome analyses were limited to a subset of patients, and we lacked detailed clinical data among many cases.",
