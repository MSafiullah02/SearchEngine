Therefore, it is critical to develop sound scientific understanding on how viruses can penetrate facemasks and infect the wearer during breathing.",

[2] reported a study on the evaluation of single-use masks and respirators for protection of health care workers against mycobacterial aerosols by measuring the filtration efficiencies of a sub-micron surgical mask and three different types of respirators. They found that mean efficiencies were 97% for the surgical mask and a dusk/mist respirator, and more than 99.9% for the high-efficiency particulate air respirator. Willekem et al. [3] investigated bacterial penetration of different bacterial shapes, aerodynamic sizes, and flow rates through a surgical mask and a dust/mist respirator. The authors found that the spherical corn oil particles and spherical bacteria have the same penetration in size range from 0.9 to 1.7 \u03bcm, while rod-shaped bacteria penetrate less, depending on the aspect ratio of bacteria. Qian et al. [4] further studied the penetration efficiency of N95 respirators for airborne microbial and inert particles. Using laboratory tests with NaCl certification aerosols and measurements with particle-size spectrometers, N95 respirators were found to have higher filtration efficiency than DM and DFM respirators and non-certified surgical masks. The authors concluded that N95 respirators provide excellent protection against airborne particles when there is good face seal.",

A N95 mask that can filter out particles down to 0.3 \u03bcm can obviously filter out droplets greater in size. However, SARS corona viruses are irregularly shaped and are about 60\u2013120 nm in diameter. Therefore, viruses may be able to penetrate or spread through the mask in the form of liquid diffusion by a capillary effect, particularly since the expired air will most likely wet the mask. The high moisture content and high temperature in the expired air can cause water vapor to condense in the mask due to the temperature difference between the air and the mask. The droplets that are expelled when speaking will accelerate the wetting process. The action of breathing will mechanically reinforce the penetration. During repeated breathing actions, a mask also becomes a collector of viruses, particularly when its outer surface is exposed to contaminated droplets. This process is a typical physical process of coupled heat and mass transfer in porous materials such as non-woven textile materials. As viruses and bacteria can stay on the surface and in the masks for significantly long time period during wear, it is obviously dangerous and undesirable if they can live comfortably and stay active in the warm and humid microenvironment in the masks. In order to avoid these phenomena, it is necessary to study the transfer mechanisms of the virus or bacteria in the mask and to supervise the design and usage of the mask according to these mechanisms.",

The researcher sprayed the simulated viral solution onto the facemask once at a distance 1 m every 10 min. The simulated viral solution was sprayed on the mask seven times during the walking in total. The average weight of the splash in one stroke of spray was 2 ml. The simulated viral solution was made up with KCl (potassium chloride) water solution, in which the K+ concentration is 0.02 g/cm3. Seventy minutes later K+ content of each layer was obtained. Further, the relative K+ content of each layer to K+ content of the whole mask was calculated by dividing the K+ content of each layer with the sum of K+ content of all layers for each mask. All the percentages were used as the basis for analysis of the test results for four layers of N95 masks. The initial and boundary\u2019s conditions in simulation are listed in Table 1\n.

The viruses transfer in the mask mainly by diffusion in liquid water, and the evaporation of liquid water increases the virus concentration in liquid water. The virus mass in liquid water is larger than that on the surface of fibers in deposition because of small penetration velocity of liquid water.3.The concentration of water vapor and pressure of the gas in the mask change periodically with the breathing cycles.
