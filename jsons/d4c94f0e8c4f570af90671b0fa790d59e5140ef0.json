It spread rapidly to many countries and developing a SARS vaccine is now urgently required. In order to study the immunogenicity of UV-inactivated purified SARS-CoV virion as a vaccine candidate, we subcutaneously immunized mice with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV with or without an adjuvant. We chose aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) as an adjuvant, because of its long safety history for human use. We observed that the UV-inactivated SARS-CoV virion elicited a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in the generation of long-term antibody secreting and memory B cells. With the addition of alum to the vaccine formula, serum IgG production was augmented and reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice, though it was still insufficient to elicit serum IgA antibodies. Notably, the SARS-CoV virion itself was able to induce long-term antibody production even without an adjuvant. Anti-SARS-CoV antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the virus and were able to neutralize the virus. Furthermore, the UV-inactivated virion induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-c and TNF-a) upon restimulation with inactivated SARS-CoV virion in vitro. Thus, a whole killed virion could serve as a candidate antigen for a SARS vaccine to elicit both humoral and cellular immunity.",

Upon this outbreak, a global collaboration network was coordinated by WHO. As a result of this unprecedented international effort, a novel type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiologic agent of SARS (1, 2) in March 2003. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV was completed and we now know that SARS-CoV has all the features and characteristics of other coronaviruses, but it is quite different from all previously known coronaviruses (groups I~III), representing a new group (group IV) (3, 4) . It is assumed that SARS-CoV is a mutant coronavirus transmitted from a wild animal that developed the ability to productively infect humans (3, 5) . The genome of SARS-CoV is a single-stranded plus-sense RNA~30 kb in length and containing five major open reading frames that encode nonstructural replicase polyproteins and structural proteins: the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N), in the same order and of approximately the same sizes as those of other coronaviruses (5) .",

In patients with SARS and probable SARS cases, virus is detected in sputum, stool and plasma by RT-PCR (1, 2) . These patients developed serum antibodies against SARS-CoV and high antibody titers against N protein were maintained for more than 5 months after infection (6) . Because of their generally poor pathogenicity and difficulty of propagation in vitro, there have been few studies regarding immunity to human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E. In the veterinary field, however, coronaviruses have been known for many years to cause a variety of lung, liver and gut diseases in animals. As we learned from these animal models, both humoral and cellular immune responses may contribute to protection against coronavirus diseases, including SARS [for review see (7) ].",

Because an influenza epidemic may occur simultaneously with the re-emergence of SARS, it is urgently required that we develop effective SARS vaccines as well as sensitive diagnostic tests specific for SARS. Recently, the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV (8) . The first step in viral infection is presumably the binding of S protein to its receptor, ACE2. In the murine MHV model, S proteins are known to contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibodies in mice (9, 10) . Therefore, the S protein would be the first candidate coronavirus protein for induction of immunity. However, the S, M and N proteins are also known to contribute to generating the host immune response (11, 12) .",

Because mice inoculated with virion/alum showed a high basal level of proliferation of lymph node T cells in the absence of antigen, there is not much difference in the net proliferative response of these cells between the virion/ alum group and the virion only group. On the other hand, in splenic T cells, a low level of proliferation was observed only in the virion/alum group of mice.

Sera were obtained from mice 1 week after boost vaccination and subjected to SARS-CoV neutralizing activity assay as described in Methods. The titer is a reciprocal number of minimum serum dilution that inhibits the cytopathic effect. structures such as hepatitis B virus surface antigen-based, HIV-1 Gag-based and Ty virus-like particles have been shown to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune responses (19) , these particulates probably have comparable dimensions and structures to the pathogens that are targeted for uptake by APCs to facilitate the induction of potent immune responses. The antibodies elicited in mice vaccinated by the current protocol with or without adjuvant recognized both the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV and were able to neutralize the infection of virus to Vero E6 cells. However, serum anti-SARS-CoV IgA antibody was not detectable, probably owing to the route of vaccination. In addition, the present vaccination protocol caused T cell response at the regional lymph nodes, although it did not allow for the induction of a sufficient cellular immune response systemically. We show here the potentiality of subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion with alum, which is utilized for most of current human vaccinations. Alum has been used as an adjuvant for vaccines such as diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus, and these vaccines have a long safety record for human use (20) . We observed that the addition of alum to the vaccine formula resulted in a large augmentation of serum IgG 1 production, but not IgG 2a production. The level of IgG 1 in alum-vaccinated mice reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice, which were subcutaneously injected with 5 lg of inactivated virion emulsified with a complete Freund adjuvant, followed by consecutive three-times intravenous boosters with 2 lg of virion. Alum is known to selectively stimulate an IgG 1 dominant, type 2 immune response [reviewed in (21) ]. Activation of complement by alum could contribute to the type 2-biased immune response partly via an inhibition of IL-12 production. Interestingly, a quite recent report demonstrated that an alum-induced Gr1 + myeloid cell population produced IL-4 and activated B-cells (22) .",

The clinical manifestations of the disease and the correlates of protection with immunity have been studied extensively in these animal coronavirus infections [reviewed in (7) ]. Although antibodies and T cells may play a role in exacerbating the pathology in some animal coronavirus infections (23, 24) , both humoral and cellular immune responses are known to contribute to protection against coronavirus infection. In murine hepatitis virus, a Group 2 coronavirus, the mortality of susceptible mice was partially prevented by the transfer of immune serum containing neutralizing antibody prior to challenge (25) . Recently, Zhi-yong et al. reported in the murine acute infection model that the neutralizing antibody elicited by vaccination of DNA encoding S was protective, but cellular components of vaccinated mice were not required for the inhibition of viral replication (26) . Because a twice parenteral administration of inactivated virion with alum induced a high level of antibodies that are able to neutralize SARS-CoV, this vaccination protocol may have a certain effect on the protection of humans from SARS-CoV infection.",

These cells were restimulated with the irradiated virus in vitro, but their response was low in terms of the level of proliferation and production of INF-c and IL-2. However, irrespective of vaccination protocols with or without alum adjuvant, virus-primed T cells of vaccinated animals were capable of producing IL-4 at high levels upon in vitro stimulation, comparable to other reports for a variety of vaccination studies (27, 28) . This outlook seems compatible with the idea that the present vaccine protocol may tend to select T-cell subsets with Th2 phenotype. However, it remains to be elucidated whether such T cells may exhibit serological memory phenotype and persist in the immune system after vaccination as long as memory B cells, which may persist more than 180 days post vaccination. In addition, further analysis is needed to clarify whether Tcell response is a crucial factor for long-term protection against SARS-CoV infections.",

For example, it has recently been reported that the combination of adenovirus vector expressing SARS-S, -M or -N protein elicited a neutralizing capacity in serum and Nspecific T-cell response in rhesus macaques (29) . However, it is still uncertain whether or not the immunity against only these components of SARS-CoV is sufficient for virus protection. SARS-CoV tends to cause replication errors, which may allow the virus to escape the host-immune response and result in a seasonal outbreak. From this point of view, it resembles influenza virus. In influenza virus, inactivated HA vaccine showed incomplete protection but had a certain efficacy and safety record for a long period of time. Indeed, this approach has been used in the veterinary field, such as with the bovine coronavirus (30) and canine coronavirus (31) . These advantages make a whole killed virion a prime candidate for a SARS vaccine, even if it may not have the best protective ability.",

In consideration that SARS-CoV transmission occurs by direct contact with droplets or by the fecal oral route, mucosal secretary IgA in both the lower respiratory tract and digestive tract seem to be crucially important. Failure to induce IgA-type antibodies in a current systemic vaccination method should be improved. Notably, IgA antibodies were detectable in the sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from mice hyper-immunized with UV-irradiated virus (data not shown). Therefore, if a non-toxic and more potent adjuvant becomes available for human use, the subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion would become an effective vaccination method to reduce the number of susceptible people.",
