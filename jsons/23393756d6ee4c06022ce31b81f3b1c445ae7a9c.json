In this article, we report on a 75-year-old man infected with 2019 novel coronavirus who has end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). COVID-19 patients with ESKD need isolation dialysis, but most of them cannot be handled in time due to limited continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines. CRRT provided benefits for this patient by removing potentially damaging toxins and stabilizing his metabolic and hemodynamic status. With the control of uremia and fluid status, this patient ended up with an uneventful post-CRRT course, absence of clinical symptoms, and negative PCR tests. Greater efforts are needed to decrease the mortality of COVID-19-infected ESKD patients.",

Due to his symptoms and travel history, a chest CT was ordered ( Fig. 1 ) and an oropharyngeal swab specimen was collected and tested with 2019 novel coronavirus RT-PCR assays several days before his hospitalization. The patient received 75 mg of oseltamivir orally twice daily. Immediately after Dian Fu and Bo Yang contributed equally. the positive RT-PCR result was revealed, the patient was referred to Huoshenshan for hospitalization. A review of the patient's history showed that he had hypertension, chronic heart failure, COPD, and ESKD and was on routine hemodialysis. The patient had an atrophied right kidney, and in 2004, he underwent an open stone surgery for his nephrolithiasis in the left kidney. After the surgery, his renal function declined gradually and eventually entered hemodialysis in 2016. Due to the exhaustion of medical resources and travel restriction inside Wuhan city, the patient presented without dialysis for 5 days. His temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, respiratory rate was 23/min, heart rate was 100/min, and blood pressure was 139/89 mm Hg. His physical examination revealed pitting edema bilaterally in his lower limbs but was otherwise unremarkable.",

Laboratory tests showed Cr 1,432.3 \u03bcmol/L, BUN 40 \u03bcmol/L, K + 4.63 mmol/L, and uric acid 760 \u03bcmol/L. On February 12, 14, 16, 19, and 23, the patient was given continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration 5 times and decreased water retention for 2,400, 1,904, 1,500, 1,200, and 1,500 mL, respectively. The total duration of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration: blood flow, 120 mL/min; effluent flow rate, 1,000 mL/h; ultrafiltration rate, 150-200 mL/h; anticoagulation agent, heparin; vascular access site, right jugular vein) was 53 h (14, 12, 8, 10, and 9 h, respectively). Respiratory distress was relieved immediately after the first CRRT session and almost disappeared after three sessions. He was also administrated Arbidol 200 mg tid for 8 days from February 12. The laboratory tests were repeated on these days (Table 1) . CRRT improved his BUN, serum Cr, uric acid, potassium, and C-reactive protein levels. The chest CT was repeated on February 22 (Fig. 1 ). An oropharyngeal swab specimen was collected twice and both tested negative in 2019 novel coronavirus RT-PCR assays on February 21 and 24, respectively. On February 26, his temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, respiratory rate was 17/min, heart rate was 79/min, blood pressure was 132/96 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation was 99% in room air. He met the criteria for hospital discharge in China (absence of clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities, and 2 negative PCR results). Then, the patient was discharged home on February 26.",

First, the ESKD pathogenesis in our case was Although CRRT is a normal treatment for saving critically ill ESKD patients, most COVID-19-infected ESKD patients would not receive CRRT or normal hemodialysis due to limited CRRT resources and strict isolation requirements. Besides, there is no family dialysis in China. As far as we know, more than 6 infected ESKD patients died of multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Therefore, more medical resources such as CRRT machines, protection suits, and N95 respirators are needed to be prepared in this COVID-19 crisis, and more intensive care is urgently needed to decrease the mortality of CO-VID-19-infected ESKD patients.",
