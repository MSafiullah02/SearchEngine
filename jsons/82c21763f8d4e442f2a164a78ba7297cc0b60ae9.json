These studies have led to the consensus that dromedary camels are the natural reservoir. They have furthermore provided some insight about the host and geographical range of the virus and have suggested some epidemiological characteristics, including the clinical picture and age distribution in dromedary camels (Wernery, Lau, & Woo, 2017) . The evidence base that builds from these experimental and field studies provides the foundation for more complex epidemiological analyses, including statistical and mathematical modelling, risk assessments and meta-analyses.

However, no formal mapping of the literature has yet been attempted. Scoping reviews provide the means to summarize and communicate findings, evaluate the existing body of literature and identify research gaps in a way that is replicable and minimizes bias (Levac, Colquhoun, & O'Brien, 2010) . High-impact emerging diseases, upon which there is typically a high degree of research activity in a short amount of time, could benefit from early and iterative synthesis research. Formal scoping reviews and/or systematic reviews can provide improved clarity for targeting research needs and therefore improve the effective and efficient use of limited resources.

Saudi Arabia has the highest human MERS burden (World Health Organization, 2018) and has conducted more observational studies in animals than any other country (Table 2). Ten publications included studies conducted in more than one country. Approximately twothirds of the studies completed sampling within a one-year period. Most of the multiple-year studies included the use of archived serum samples to investigate historical animal exposure to MERS-CoV (as far back as 1983), and bat studies that collected samples seasonally over the course of multiple years (Table 2).

While no autochtonous human cases of MERS-CoV have been reported from African countries, the endemnicity of the virus in dromedary camel populations presents on the one hand a public health risk, and on the other, an opportunity for better understanding reservoir dynamics. African countries are underrepresented in the published body of literature, with only one-fifth of the observational studies in this review conducted there. Likewise, only one study was published from the South Asia region (Saqib et al., 2017), which has a large dromedary camel population. Camel raising varies between the Middle East and other regions, and further epidemiological research coupled with anthropological and value chain studies that reflect these differences would potentially enhance our understanding of the risks for zoonotic spillover and how they differ across the regions. Almost all the publications in this review provided a measure of prevalence, including seroprevalence and prevalence of infection.Study results suggested heterogeneity around these values, especially with respect to the prevalence of infection, with point prevalence estimates ranging from zero to almost 90%. Nine studies provided variability estimates (e.g., confidence intervals) around at least one prevalence value, indicating additional post hoc calculations would be required to assess the precision of prevalence estimates. Two studies presented results of multivariable models, which can help explain apparent variability in prevalence by identifying risk factors for infection and other determinants of virus", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "as they provide a more complete picture of possible routes of transmission. This review has several limitations. It was conducted in English, which likely led to the omission of Arabic literature, introducing a language bias. Article screening and data extraction was conducted by one author which may have introduced reporting bias. This scoping review describes the general and epidemiologic characteristics of published primary studies of MERS-CoV in animal hosts. MERS-CoV is a newly discovered zoonotic disease, and there is a need to assess the evidence base so that future research strategically fills the knowledge gaps. Dromedary camels are the reservoir host for MERS-CoV; disease is mild and predominantly affects young animals. Improving our understanding of how the virus circulates in the reservoir population including dynamics of immunity, temporal and geographic variation, and key risk factors for infection would provide important insights to inform research and policy such as transmission modelling and disease prevention strategies with the ultimate goal of reducing this public health threat.

However, there is a lack of studies that test these hypotheses, and a sizeable gap in our knowledge of when and where infection rates differ, and which factors are important for infection in dromedaries.The question of camel immunity to MERS-CoV has important implications for public health risk, infection control and disease prevention. The dynamics of immunity (e.g., duration of immunity) inform intervention strategies such as vaccination, as well as research questions such as the structure of disease transmission models. Longitudinal studies have been used to infer that natural infection in dromedaries confers either waning or partial immunity to MERS-CoVHemida et al., 2017;Hemida, Perera, et al., 2014). One experimental study demonstrated partialimmunity following natural infection in alpacas (Adney, Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Hartwig, & Bowen, 2016). Longitudinal field studies may be capturing second infections or persistently infected camels with intermittent shedding. Examples of both exist among coronaviruses (Dowell & Ho, 2004; Isaacs, Flowers, Clarke, Valman, & MacNaughton, 1983), and the duration of natural immunity, and if or how reinfection differs from first infection are important characteristics to know. Molecular epidemiologic analyses, longer-term field studies or experimental studies may help to answer these questions. Vaccine studies included here have demonstrated short-term efficacy in reducing viral shedding, but further studies that examine long-term efficacy under field conditions are required. The unanswered questions surrounding natural and vaccine-induced immunity in dromedaries have important implications for the efficacy and planning of interventions targeted at animal hosts. Experimental challenge and transmission studies provided key data regarding the time course of infection. Field studies have also provided valuable information, including evidence supporting the duration of pathogen shedding (Al Muhairi et al., 2016), and documenting transmission among dromedaries", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
