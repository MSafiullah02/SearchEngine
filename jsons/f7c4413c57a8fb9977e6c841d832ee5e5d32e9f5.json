Several actions have been taken in response to COVID-19 outbreak. According to a survey of 2216 GI doctors from all over China early in the outbreak of COVID-19, the awareness of digestive system damage and involvement in COVID-19 was low, ranging from 31% to 35% [3] . To counteract this, the CSG rapidly organized a group of experts including gastroenterologists working in the forefront of COVID-19 patient care to discuss and reach a consensus on management of digestive disorders involved in COVID-19 (Table 1 ) [4] .This consensus includes recommendations regarding transmission route, clinical manifestation spectrum of digestive system involvement, practical guidelines on treatment based on the latest publications, and precautions regarding endoscopic procedure. In addition, cautions for GI outpatient clinic have been proposed [4] . The CSG is comprised of 25 committees of sub-specialty depending on the disease spectrum. As a response to the increasing concern and inquiry about COVID-19 risk from the community of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in China, the Chinese IBD Committee affiliated to CSG has issued timely recommendations for managing IBD patients in early February 2020, which is probably the first guideline regarding IBD and COVID-19 in the global community [5] . The guideline includes practical recommendations regarding immunosuppressive agent and biologics use, diet, Epidemics and public health crises pose great challenges to health care delivery. To minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by avoiding close contact with infected patients in public areas such as hospitals, telemedicine has also been widely applied in our non-COVID-19 patient care including virtual clinic visits online clinic consultancy and nurse-led care support based on interactive social care app such as WeChat. These strategies have greatly facilitated care delivery to patients with chronic GI diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.",

It is worth noting that 14 cases (10.1%) had initial symptoms of diarrhea and nausea, then fever and dyspnea [7] . This is important for gastroenterologists for screening and identifying COVID-19 cases. However, the disease course and outcomes in these subgroups of patients need further investigation. Another retrospective analysis of 1099 patients with COVID-19 showed that the main symptoms were fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%), while diarrhea (3.7%) and vomiting (5.0%) were less frequent. Among GI symptoms, the incidence of diarrhea and abdominal pain in patients with severe COVID-19 was higher than that in patients with mild COVID-19 [8] .",

Liver abnormalities of COVID-19 patients may be due to liver cell dysfunction or other causes such as drug toxicity and systemic inflammation. In a cohort of 1099 patients with COVID-19, abnormal liver function tests including elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were found in 168 (168/757, 22.2%), 158 (158/741, 21.3%) and 76 (76/722, 10.5%) of patients [8] . Data about alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were not provided in this study [8] . Another study that included 333 COVID-19 cases with liver function tests was recently reported in a Wuhan medical center. The incidence of liver injury was 39.6% (132/333) with the majority (71.2%, 94/132) being mild elevation in liver enzyme tests. TBIL were elevated in only13 patients (13/333, 3.9%). Regarding underlying liver conditions, 12 patients had a history of chronic hepatitis B and 2 patients had a history of chronic hepatitis C, but the detection of viral nucleic acid showed no active hepatitis [10] .There was no significant difference in the ratio of liver injury between patients in an ICU (45.6%, 26/57) or the general ward (38.4%, 106/276) (P > 0.05). However, in another study including 305 confirmed COVID-19 cases, the incidence of liver injury in ICU patients (67.4%, 31/46) was significantly higher than that on general wards (34.1%, 88/258) (P < 0.05) [11] . Currently there is only one published autopsy report in an 85-year-old man with COVID-19, which showed segmental dilatation and stenosis in the small intestine [12] . Further studies are needed to clarify whether this finding is secondary to COVID-19 or a pre-existing GI comorbidity.",

Emerging evidence shows persistence of SARS-COV-2 virus RNA in stool samples or rectal swabs even after respiratory specimens tested negative [6, 16] . In a recent landmark clinical investigation on ten pediatric COVID-19 cases in China, eight persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative, suggesting that the gastrointestinal tract may continue to shed virus [6] .

The guideline has recently become the most read article on the website of the Chinese Journal of Digestion, the official journal of the CSG. The actions to an epidemic outbreak must be culturally appropriate. The measures implemented in China may be instructive for other countries now struggling to control COVID-19. More than 40, 000 healthcare workers including clinicians, nurses, laboratory technicians and coordination staff members, have voluntarily been transferred to clinical care of COVID-19 patients in Hubei province from other parts of China. Gastroenterologists are an important part of the volunteer clinicians; they have provided practical consultant care opinions to patients with COVID-19, especially those with comorbidities or complications in GI tract and liver. The CSG pays close attention to the situation of our gastroenterologists in Hubei province. To increase the awareness of COVID-19 in the GI community, we launched an online platform in the portal website of the CSG (http://www.csge.org.cn) for sharing clinical experiences from our gastroenterologists working in the forefront; they are typical examples of modern heroes in this unexpected war against a difficult enemy. Their professionalism and passion for the specialty, and compassion for the patients have greatly encouraged gastroenterologists nationwide.Healthcare workers are especially at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19. Given that GI COVID-19 infection has been confirmed and fecal excretion of virus has been reported[1,6], much attention has been paid to the potential risk of infection during procedures such as endoscopy and colonoscopy. The CSG coordinated efforts by associations, including the Chinese Society of Digestive Endoscopy, in a comprehensive effort to propose recommendations and guidelines to prevent our gastroenterologists from infection in their clinical practice.",
