Both HR2P-M2 and HR2P strongly inhibited S protein\u2013mediated cell-cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 0.55 and 0.97 \u00b5mol/L, respectively (Figure 1B), indicating that HR2P-M2 has improved membrane fusion inhibitory activity compared with HR2P. SARS CP-1 peptide did not inhibit MERS-CoV S\u2013mediated cell-cell fusion at concentrations up to 20 \u00b5mol/L, confirming a previous observation by Lu et al [16]. The MERS-CoV S protein HR1 domain, the target site of HR2-derived peptides (eg, HR2P and HR2P-M2), has largely conserved sequences when different strains are compared. Among clinical MERS-CoV strains, only 1 amino acid change at position 1020 of the HR1 domain (Q1020H or Q1020R) (Figure 1A) was observed, and this was present in nearly all strains [29, 30]. To test whether HR2P-M2 was effective against these MERS-CoV strains, we compared the inhibitory activity of HR2P-M2 on cell-cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S protein, with or without Q1020H or Q1020R mutations. Surprisingly, HR2P-M2 was about 0.9\u20132.6-fold more potent in inhibiting cell-cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S protein bearing Q1020H and Q1020R, respectively, than the WT S protein of the EMC/2012 strain (Figure 1C).\n",

We then constructed pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with Q1020H or Q1020R mutations and compared their sensitivity with that of HR2P-M2. Similarly, HR2P-M2 was about 5\u20138-fold more effective at inhibiting infection by the pseudoviruses carrying mutant S protein (Q1020H or Q1020R) than infection by the pseudovirus carrying the WT S protein, whereas CP-1 displayed no inhibition of either mutant MERS-CoV pseudovirus (Figure 1E and 1F). These results suggest that HR2P-M2 is expected to be effective against all MERS-CoV strains isolated so far.",

Therefore, to determine whether IFN-\u03b2, HR2P-M2, or IFN-\u03b2/HR2P-M2 could enhance virus clearance in the absence of adaptive immune response, MERS-CoV\u2013infected Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice were treated prophylactically or therapeutically, as described above for C57BL/6 mice. Prophylactic treatment resulted in enhanced virus clearance at 72 hours after infection, with complete virus clearance in 1/8 HR2P-M2 and 4/8 IFN-\u03b2/HR2P-M2 mice (Figure 5C). Similarly, measurement of viral titers at 96 hours after infection, following therapeutic treatment at 12 and 36 hours, revealed significant decreases in titers after all treatments (P < .005 vs PBS treatment). As before, viral titers were most reduced in mice treated with IFN-\u03b2/HR2P-M2 (Figure 5B and 5D).",

This combination was also provided to several severely ill patients, and though it reduced the mortality rate 14 days after treatment, it did not show beneficial effects by 28 days, possibly because of late administration [35]. Ribavirin/IFN-a2b in combination with HR2P-M2 may diminish morbidity and mortality rates more successfully than either therapy alone. Recently, several compounds from Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved drug libraries were reported to have inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV replication in cell culture [36, 37]. Liu et al demonstrated that some of these MERS-CoV replication inhibitors could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but most of them did not inhibit MERS-CoV S protein\u2013mediated membrane fusion, and none was able to inhibit 6-HB formation [38]. Therefore, these small-molecule MERS-CoV replication inhibitors seem to have mechanisms of action different from that of the peptide MERS-CoV fusion inhibitor HR2P [16].",

B, D, Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced C57BL/6 (B) and RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice (D) were infected intranasally with 1 \u00d7 105 PFUs of MERS-CoV in a total volume of 50 \u00b5L of DMEM. At 12 hours and 36 hours after infection, mice were treated intranasally with 2000 U of IFN-\u03b2, 200 \u00b5g of HR2P-M2, both IFN-\u03b2 (2000 U) and HR2P-M2 (200 \u00b5g), or PBS only. Viral titers were determined on day 4 after infection. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments with 4 mice per group per experiment. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student t test. A, \u2020P < .001 (PBS vs other groups); *P < .02 (IFN-\u03b2 vs other treated groups); \u2021P < .01 (HR2P-M2 vs IFN-\u03b2 + HR2P-M2). B, \u2020P < .01 (PBS vs other groups); *P < .03 (IFN-\u03b2 vs other treated groups); \u2021P < .01 (HR2P-M2 vs IFN-\u03b2 + HR2P-M2). C, \u2020P < .002 (PBS vs other groups); *P < .01 (IFN-\u03b2 vs other treated groups). D, \u2020P < .01 (PBS vs other groups); *,\u2021P < .01, IFN-\u03b2 + HR2P-M2 vs IFN-\u03b2; \u2021P < .01, IFN-\u03b2 + HR2P-M2 vs HR2P-M2. E, Histological examination of lungs from MERS-CoV\u2013infected, Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced C57BL/6 mice at 7 days after infection. Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with 1 \u00d7 105 PFUs MERS-CoV in a total volume of 50 \u00b5L of DMEM. At 12 and 36 hours after MERS-CoV infection, mice were treated intranasally with 100 \u00b5L of PBS (50 + 50 \u00b5L at 10-minute intervals) containing 2000 U of IFN-\u03b2, 200 \u00b5g of HR2P-M2, both IFN-\u03b2 (2000 U) and HR2P-M2 (200 \u00b5g), or PBS only, respectively. After mice were killed on day 7 after infection, lungs were removed, fixed in zinc formalin, and paraffin embedded; sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (original magnification, \u00d710). The green stars (asterisks) indicate the sites of infiltration. Abbreviations: Ad5, adenovirus serotype 5; HR, heptad repeat.",
