Cell wall\u2010modifying enzymes are required for normal pollen tube elongation (Krichevsky et al., 2007). Exocytosis is also one of the major processes responsible for polarized cell growth (Malho et al., 2006).

The normal initiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis is facilitated by at least 12 eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs), several of which are multiprotein complexes. The largest, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) (approximately 650 kDa), participates in most translation initiation processes (Asano et al., 1997a; Sonenberg et al., 2000; Kawaguchi and Bailey\u2010Serres, 2002). eIF3 helps to maintain the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits in a dissociated state, and stabilizes binding of the eIF2\u2013GTP\u2013Met\u2013tRNAiMet ternary complex to the 40S subunit (Chaudhuri et al., 1999; Sonenberg et al., 2000). It promotes binding of the 43S pre\u2010initiation complex to the 5\u2032 end of mRNA (Kolupaeva et al., 2005; Hinnebusch, 2006). Moreover, it also plays roles in scanning for and recognizing AUG start codons (Lukaszewicz et al., 2000; Dever, 2002; Nielsen et al., 2004; Valasek et al., 2004).",

These are conserved in mammals, Triticum aestivum (wheat), Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster (Asano et al., 1997b; Burks et al., 2001; Masutani et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008). However, only eIF3a, eIF3b and eIF3c are found in the eIF3 core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has five subunits (eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3g and eIF3i), indicating that eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3h may not be necessary for global translation initiation (Asano et al., 1998; Burks et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2005). eIF3e and eIF3h are not essential for global translation initiation in fission yeast, but their knockout affects spore formation, indicating that they may have special roles in cell differentiation (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2005; Ray et al., 2008). eIF3f is down\u2010regulated in many human tumours, and over\u2010expression of eIF3f inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in tumour cells (Shi et al., 2006; 2008a, 2008b). These results suggest that eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3h play important roles in the normal growth of human and yeast cells but are not necessary for global translation initiation.",

Over\u2010expression of eIF3e affects seed formation (Yahalom et al., 2008). Therefore, eIF3e plays roles in Arabidopsis embryogenesis. Mutation of the Arabidopsis eIF3h gene not only significantly reduced Arabidopsis fertility, but also resulted in hypersensitivity of eif3h\u20101 mutant seedlings to exogenous sugars (2004, 2007). In summary, eIF3e and eIF3h are important for normal plant cell growth. However, the roles of subunit eIF3f are largely unknown in plant species.",

As the At2g39990 protein was identified in the Arabidopsis eIF3 complex and has high similarities to the eIF3f proteins found in many species (Burks et al., 2001), we named the gene Arabidopsis thaliana eIF3f (AteIF3f), and the mutant alleles used in this study were named ateif3f\u20101 and ateif3f\u20102. AteIF3f was highly expressed in pollen grains, pollen tubes, embryos and root tips, and was also constitutively expressed in other tissues. In a pollen rescue experiment, we found that the mutation in AteIF3f also led to defects in embryogenesis. Further transcriptome analysis using ateif3f\u20101 homozygous seedlings generated by pollen rescue showed that AteIF3f affected the expression of genes that are essential for pollen tube growth and embryogenesis, for example AtCSLA7 (Goubet et al., 2003). We also demonstrated that AteIF3f interacts with Arabidopsis eIF3e and eIF3h. These results suggest that eIF3f may play important roles in plant cell growth in combination with eIF3e and eIF3h in Arabidopsis.",

The Ds insertion created a genetic tag of kanamycin resistance in the mutant plant and a GUS reporter that was expressed specifically in pollen grains (see Figure S1a,b). We first performed a genetic analysis of the ateif3f\u20101 mutant (Table 1). The progeny from self\u2010crossed ateif3f\u20101/+ plants exhibited a segregation ratio of approximately 1:1 kanamycin\u2010resistant (KanR):kanamycin\u2010sensitive (KanS) (2116:2202), rather than the typical Mendelian segregation ratio of 3:1, and no KanR homozygous plants were identified in the progeny.

The qrt1\u20102 mutation blocks separation of the pollen grains from tetrads and has almost no effect on pollen tube growth (Preuss et al., 1994). Therefore, a quartet from an ateif3f\u20101/+ qrt1\u20102/qrt1\u20102 plant has two ateif3f\u20101 qrt1\u20102 pollen grains (mutant) and two qrt1\u20102 pollen grains (representing wild\u2010type) derived from the same microsporocyte.

Meanwhile, the mature pollen grains from ateif3f\u20101/+ plants, which contained 50%ateif3f\u20101 mutant pollen grains and 50% wild\u2010type pollen grains, were also cultured in vitro. GUS staining showed that, of the cultured pollen grains, the mutant pollen grains with GUS staining did not germinate or the pollen tube emerged but then stopped growing (Figure 1e), while the wild\u2010type pollen grains without GUS staining produced a normal pollen tube (Figure 1f). Statistical analysis showed that only 40.2% of the pollen grains from ateif3f\u20101/+ plants (327/815) germinated in vitro, compared with 80.5% of the pollen grains from wild\u2010type plants (317/394) (Figure 1g).

PCR analysis using a T\u2010DNA left\u2010border primer and a gene\u2010specific primer confirmed that T\u2010DNA was inserted in the 3rd exon, 954 bp downstream of the ATG in AteIF3f (Figure 2a and Figure S2). The mutant also carried a KanR\u2010selective marker. The progeny from self\u2010pollinated ateif3f\u20102/+ plants also exhibited a KanR:KanS segregation ratio of approximately 1:1 (1132:1348), instead of 3:1. When a wild\u2010type AteIF3f full\u2010length genomic DNA construct was introduced into ateif3f\u20102/+ plants, 17 of 20 T1 transgenic ateif3f\u20102/+ lines showed an increased KanR:KanS segregation ratio of approximately 2:1. These findings are consistent with the results obtained from the study of ateif3f\u20101/+ plants, and confirm that the defect in male gametophytes in ateif3f\u20101 is caused by a mutation in AteIF3f.",

In the siliques of these pollen\u2010rescued plants, approximately 25% (151:627) of the seeds were defective (Figure 6a,c) compared to seeds from wild\u2010type siliques (Figure 6b,d). The abnormal embryos stopped developing and started to degrade at various stages in different pollen\u2010rescued lines. We randomly selected four transgenic lines, two from each construct, for further observation. In one transgenic line, the abnormal embryo stopped developing at the early globular stage (Figure 6e) and started to degrade when the normal embryos in the same silique were at the transition (globular to heart) stage (Figure 6f). In the other two transgenic lines, the mutant embryos developed to the late globular stage but were inflated and abnormal (Figure 6g), while the normal embryos in the same silique had developed to the torpedo stage (Figure 6h). In a few cases, the abnormal embryo survived (Figure 6i) until the normal embryos matured (Figure 6j). Some of the defective embryos developed into mature seeds and gave rise to seedlings on regular MS medium (Figure 7a). These seedlings had malformations in body shape, lacked chlorophyll and had abnormal anthocyanin accumulation, suggesting that their cell division and plastid differentiation processes were affected. Sometimes they even lacked hypocotyls and cotyledons (Figure 7b\u2013d), and their root cell structure was severely disordered and disperse (Figure 7e). A PCR assay using DNA from the defective ateif3f\u20101 seedlings indicated that they were homozygous for the ateif3f\u20101 mutation. Real\u2010time PCR and RT\u2010PCR assays using RNA extracted from ateif3f\u20101 homozygous seedlings showed that expression of AteIF3f was dramatically lower in such seedlings (Figure 7f,g). Transgenic wild\u2010type plants with either pLAT52:AteIF3f cDNA or pVGD1:AteIF3f cDNA construct were also examined as negative controls. No defective embryos were found in these transgenic plants.

            "text": "In mammals, the subunit eIF3f is not essential for global translation initiation, but it has a wide range of roles in normal cell growth. For instance, eIF3f plays a central role in both the atrophic and the hypertrophic pathways in muscle cells. Genetic blockade of eIF3f expression induced atrophy. On the other hand, genetic activation of eIF3f promoted structural muscle protein synthesis and led to muscle hypertrophy (Csibi et al., 2008). However, the roles of eIF3f in plant cells remain unknown. In this study, we found that a mutation in AteIF3f severely affected pollen germination and embryogenesis, providing evidence for an important role of AteIF3f in plant species. Transcriptome analysis of ateif3f\u20101 homozygous seedlings showed that lack of AteIF3f significantly altered the expression of more than 3000 genes, many of which are important development\u2010related genes, for example AtCSLA7. We verified that the expression of AtCSLA7 was truly down\u2010regulated in the mutant using real\u2010time PCR. The expression of AtCSLA7 was reduced to about 7% of the wild\u2010type level in homozygous ateif3f\u20101 mutant seedlings (Figure 8a). AtCSLA7 belongs to a subfamily of cellulose synthase\u2010like (CLS) genes that are involved in biosynthesis of the plant cell wall. Mutation in AtCSLA7 affected pollen tube growth and led to seed lethality (Goubet et al., 2003). The microarray data also showed that ASN1, SCO1, AtNAP7 and CAO were significantly down\u2010regulated in the mutant seedlings. The expression level of SCO1 was reduced to 14% of the wild\u2010type level in homozygous ateif3f\u20101 seedlings. Mutant sco1 (snowy cotyledon1) embryos produce undifferentiated proplastids, resulting in defects in greening of the cotyledons of sco1 seedlings (Albrecht et al., 2006). The expression level of AtNAP1 was reduced to 31% of the wild\u2010type level in the ateif3f\u20101 homozygous seedlings. The AtNAP7 protein is localized in the plastid. Mutation of AtNAP7 led to embryonic lethality at the globular stage. The atnap7 mutant contained abnormally developing plastids with disorganized thylakoid structures (Xu and Moller, 2004). Expression of the chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO) gene, which regulates chlorophyll b synthesis, was reduced to 2.5% of the wild\u2010type level in homozygous ateif3f\u20101 seedlings (Espineda et al., 1999; Yamasato et al., 2008). In summary, these results imply that AtelF3f plays important roles in plant cell development, possibly by regulating the expression of genes important for normal pollen tube growth, embryo development, plastid differentiation and chlorophyll synthesis.",

It has been reported that eIF3h is involved in translational initiation of transcription factor ATB2/AtbZIP11 mRNA (2004, 2007). Previous studies proposed that ASN1 and ProDH2 were two direct targets of transcription factor ATB2/AtbZIP11 in Arabidopsis (Hanson et al., 2008) and the translation of AtbZIP11 mRNA was repressed by sucrose (Rook et al., 1998; Wiese et al., 2004). Our microarray, real\u2010time PCR and RT\u2010PCR analyses all showed that the expression level of ASN1, the direct target of AtbZIP11, was drastically reduced in ateif3f\u20101 homozygous seedlings (Figure 8c,d) (Hanson et al., 2008). The microarray assay showed that expression of AtbZIP11 at the transcriptional level was not reduced in ateif3f\u20101 homozygous seedlings compared to wild\u2010type seedlings. Thus, the ateif3f\u20101 mutation did not affect the transcription of AtbZIP11 mRNA. However, we still lack direct protein evidence for the effect of the ateif3f\u20101 mutation on AtbZIP11 mRNA translation due to a lack of ateif3f\u20101 homozygous materials for protein preparation. Nevertheless, our results at least provide a clue that AtelF3f may affect the function of AtbZIP11 in expression of ASN1.\n",

This assumption is consistent with the ateif3f\u20101 mutant phenotypes observed in this study. For instance, the pollen tube growth of ateif3f\u20101 was inhibited. In the pollen\u2010rescued mutant lines, the ateif3f\u20101 homozygous embryos were defective in organogenesis. Cotyledon and root formation were severely affected in some ateif3f\u20101 homozygous seedlings.

            "text": "eIF3 is structurally related to two other protein complexes, the COP9 signalosome (CSN) and the 19S proteasome lid. Most subunits of all three complexes contain one of two signature motifs, the PCI (proteasome/CSN/eIF3) domain or the MPN domain (Hofmann and Bucher, 1998). The subunits of the three complexes share sequence homologies with each other, and have a common 6 PCI + 2 MPN domain structure (Kim et al., 2001; Chang and Schwechheimer, 2004; Scheel and Hofmann, 2005). Thus, subunits from one complex can interact with subunits from other complexes (Karniol et al., 1998; Yahalom et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2005). In Arabidopsis, previous studies have shown that eIF3h directly interacts with eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3e, CSN7 and CSN8 (Kim et al., 2004). The subunit eIF3e was purified together with the COP9 signalosome when it was first identified in plants (Karniol et al., 1998). eIF3e also exhibited subcellular co\u2010localization with CSN and was negatively regulated by CSN (2001, 2008). The multiple binding partnerships of eIF3e and eIF3h in Arabidopsis suggest that their activity might be regulated by these interacting proteins. In plant species, eIF3f has been identified from wheat and Arabidopsis eIF3 complexes. However, the interactive partners of eIF3f in plants remained unclear.",

Although the interaction partners of eIF3f are less well known in plant cells, several binding partners and a potential binding site of eIF3f have been identified in humans and yeast. For example, eIF3f is involved in apoptosis by interacting with cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 11 (CDK11), which is an important effector in apoptosis (2003, 2009). Additionally, eIF3f interacts with coronavirus spike protein to inhibit host cell translation (Xiao et al., 2008). eIF3f has also been reported to be a key target of the muscle\u2010specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MAFbx/Atrogin\u20101 for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome during muscle atrophy (Csibi et al., 2008). A possible binding site for mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and S6K1 was found in the eIF3f subunit in mammals and yeast (Hinnebusch, 2006). The studies showed that the TOR signalling network regulates the translation and transcription of ribosomal components, and revealed that S6K1 phosphorylates several targets related to translation. eIF3f mediates the association between the eIF3 complex and mTOR or S6K1, which switch the eIF3 complex on and off (Holz et al., 2005; Harris et al., 2006). These results imply the existence of many potential binding partners for AteIF3f in Arabidopsis.",
