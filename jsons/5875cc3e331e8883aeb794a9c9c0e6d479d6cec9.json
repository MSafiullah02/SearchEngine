Microglia, the resident inflammatory cells of the brain, are important for pathogen detection and initiation of innate immunity, however, a novel role for these cells as immune regulators has also emerged. PD-L1 on microglia has been shown to negatively regulate T-cell activation in models of multiple sclerosis and acute viral encephalitis. In this study, we investigated the role of glial cell PD-L1 in controlling encephalitogenic CD8 1 T-lymphocytes, which infiltrate the brain to manage viral infection, but remain to produce chronic neuroinflammation. Using a model of chronic neuroinflammation following murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-induced encephalitis, we found that CD8 1 T-cells persisting within the brain expressed PD-1. Conversely, activated microglia expressed PD-L1. In vitro, primary murine microglia, which express low basal levels of PD-L1, upregulated the co-inhibitory ligand on IFN-g-treatment. Blockade of the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway in microglial: CD8 1 T-cell co-cultures increased T-cell IFN-g and interleukin (IL)22 production. We observed a similar phenomenon following blockade of this co-inhibitory pathway in astrocyte: CD8 1 T-cell co-cultures. Using ex vivo cultures of brain leukocytes, including microglia and CD8 1 T-cells, obtained from mice with MCMV-induced chronic neuroinflammation, we found that neutralization of either PD-1 or PD-L1 increased IFN-g production from virus-specific CD8 1 T-cells stimulated with MCMV IE1 168-176 peptide. These data demonstrate that microglia and astrocytes control antiviral T-cell responses and suggest a therapeutic potential of PD1: PD-L1 modulation to manage the deleterious consequences of uncontrolled neuroinflammation.",

In the absence of PD-L1 (PD-L1 2/2 mice), coronavirus infection of the brain resulted in a heightened inflammatory response, ultimately leading to the more rapid clearance of virus from the CNS (Phares et al., 2013) . This comes at a cost however, PD-L1 2/2 mice exhibited quicker onset of clinical symptoms and a higher rate of mortality, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in negatively regulating neuroinflammation in the brain. PD-L1 expression on microglia, as well as on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, has been shown to decrease T-cell activation in models of multiple sclerosis, as well as during acute viral encephalitis (Duncan and Miller, 2011; Magnus et al., 2005; Phares et al., 2009 ). However, little is known about the immunoregulatory role of microglia during chronic, persistent neuroinflammation in animals that recover from viral brain infection.",

Using a mouse model of murine (M) CMV infection, we have previously shown that, in the aftermath of a nonlethal acute viral infection, the CNS is maintained in a state of chronic neuroinflammation. Sustained immune activation within the brain is a key feature of herpesvirus pathogenicity (Armien et al., 2010) , along with the establishment of latency after clearance of acute infection and the potential for virus reactivation (Fields, 2007) . Prolonged immune responses within the brain following MCMV infection are characterized by persistence of antibody-producing B-cells, chronic microglial cell activation, and retention of MCMV-specific effector-memory CD8 1 T-cells (Mutnal et al., 2011b; Mutnal et al., 2012) . Although CD8 1 T-cells play an important role in controlling acute brain infection (Reddehase et al., 1987 (Reddehase et al., , 1985 , the chronic presence of these IFN-g-producing T-cells may be damaging to the brain. Although retention of antigen-specific CD8 1 T-cells following MCMV infection helps to protect against virus reactivation, they are also responsible for long-term activation of microglia throughout the brain (Mutnal et al., 2011b) . Cytotoxic CD8 T-lymphocytes have been shown responsible for the destruction of healthy bystander neurons in the retina (McPherson et al., 2006) . Thus, maintaining CD8 1 T-cells in a functionally suppressed state in the brain may enable both adequate neuroprotection from subsequent infection or reactivation, while also limiting unnecessary bystander neurotoxicity.",

This infection is rapidly cleared through the action of microglia, the resident CNS immune sentinels, and the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells from the periphery. We have previously shown that this acute and controlled viral brain infection results in chronic neuroinflammation that can persist for at least 30 d following viral clearance (Mutnal et al., 2011b) . Isolation and flow cytometry of brain mononuclear cells (BMNCs), including microglia and CNS-infiltrating leukocytes, from MCMVinfected mice showed that microglia upregulate the surrogate activation marker, MHC Class II, during the acute phase of infection and continue to chronically express this protein on their surface (Mutnal et al., 2011b) . MHC Class II expression on microglia is notably absent in sham-, mock-, and uninfected mice. In this study, we first confirmed this widespread and prolonged expression of MHC Class II on microglia using immunohistochemistry. At 30 days postinfection (dpi) in the postencephalitic brains of MCMV-infected mice, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) was found to colocalize with MHC Class II on activated microglia (Fig. 1A) .",

            "text": "Recent studies suggest that antigen presenting cells, such as microglia, can suppress T-cell activation through the PD-1: PD-L1 inhibitory pathway. Microglial suppression of CD4 1 and CD8 1 T-cells has been shown during the active phase of viral infection in murine models of multiple sclerosis (Carter et al., 2007; Magnus et al., 2005; Phares et al., 2013) . It is not known whether similar mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of T-cells persisting within the CNS during chronic neuroinflammation in the absence of active viral replication. Using our MCMV brain infection model, we first examined the kinetics of PD-L1 expression on microglia from the acute, productive phase of infection (7 dpi) into the chronic neuroinflammatory, postviral clearance phase (30 dpi). Resting microglia, which are identified by flow cytometry as the CD45 int CD11b 1 population, in uninfected mice expressed low levels of PD-L1. In contrast, during the acute phase of viral infection PD-L1 surface expression on microglia increased dramatically (control 5 19.7% vs. MCMVinfected 5 90.6%) and remained elevated during persistent neuroinflammation (29.4%; Fig. 1B ). Persistent Brain-Infiltrating CD8 1 T-Cells Express the PD-1 Receptor CD8 1 T-cells are pivotal to the active clearance of virus from the brain during MCMV infection. As previously shown in mouse models of herpesvirus brain infection (Armien et al., 2010; Mutnal et al., 2011b) , we found immunohistological evidence that CD8 1 T-cells persist in the postencephalitic brain following MCMV clearance ( Fig. 2A ). In addition, kinetic analysis of BMNCs for brain infiltrating CD8 1 T-cells (gated on the CD45 1 CD11b low infiltrating T-cell population) from MCMV-infected brain homogenates showed an increase in the percentage of CD8 1 T-cells as the infection progressed from the acute (7 dpi 5 29.9%) to chronic (30 dpi 5 64.5%) phases of disease (Fig. 2B) . In brain tissues obtained from shaminfected, control animals, infiltrating CD45(hi) cells were found to be rare (5.6%; Cheeran et al., 2009b; Mutnal et al., 2010 Mutnal et al., , 2011a .",

To investigate the interaction of microglia and CD8 1 T-cells during chronic neuroinflammation, we examined CD8 1 T-cell PD-1 expression kinetics following MCMV brain infection. To this end, BMNCs were isolated from MCMV-infected mice at 7 and 30 dpi. The CD45 1 CD11b low -identified T-cell population was further gated on for analysis of the CD8 1 subpopulation. During the acute phase of infection (7 dpi) PD-1 surface expression on CD8 1 T-cells within the brain was elevated (40.7%). PD-1 expression remained elevated on CD8 1 T-cells during CNS persistence (14 dpi 5 14.7%; 30 dpi 5 8.3%), however, the percentage of PD-1 1 CD8 1 cells decreased compared with levels observed during the acute infection (Fig. 2C) . The CD45 1 CD11b low population of T-cells is notably absent from mock-and uninfected mice (Cheeran et al., 2007) , thus PD-1 expression on CD8 1 T-cells within control mice is not measurable.",

IFN-g, TNFa, or IL-1b stimulation for 24 h resulted in a four-fold increase in PD-L1 mRNA expression in microglia, compared with unstimulated controls (Fig. 3A) . Similarly, 24 h incubation with IFN-g, a potent T-cellsecreted cytokine, resulted in a robust increase of surfaceexpressed PD-L1 on microglia (control 5 8.6%; IFNg 5 92.9%; Fig. 3B ). These data confirmed previous reports that resting microglia express low levels of PD-L1 (Magnus et al., 2005) . As a positive control for microglial activation, we found that IFN-g-treatment induced microglial expression of MHC Class II (control 5 18.0%; IFN-g 5 81.7%; Fig. 3C ). Both constitutive and IFN-g-induced MHC Class I expression were also detected (control 5 44.1%; IFNg 5 74.5%; Fig. 3D ).",

Total BMNCs, which include CD4 1 T-cells, CD8 1 Tcells and microglia, were incubated with MCMV IE1 168-176 (0, 5, and 50 mM), which has previously been identified as a CD8 1 T-cell-specific MHC Class I restricted epitope (Del Val et al., 1988; Holtappels et al., 2002) , for 48 h and supernatants were analyzed for IFN-g and IL-2 via ELISA.

Using PD-L1 neutralizing antibody, added 1 h prior to MCMV IE1 168-176 stimulation, we were able to specifically assess the role of PD-L1 on CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g production.

In comparison to microglia, astrocyte MHC Class II expression is slower to develop and less robust, thus deeming them the \"nonprofessional\" antigen presenting cells in the brain (Vardjan et al., 2012) . Little is known about the antigen presenting capacity of astrocytes in our model of MCMV-induced encephalitis. In this study, we first examined MCMV-infected brain tissue and confirmed MHC Class II colocalization with GFAP-labeled astrocytes in postencephalitic (30 dpi) mice (Fig. 6A) . Chronic astrocyte activation, as indicated by MHC Class II expression, a known marker for glial cell activation, suggests a role for these cells during postencephalitic neuroinflammation, like that observed for microglia.

PD-1 binding with the negative co-stimulatory molecule PD-L1, which is upregulated on antigen presenting cells, is a well-known mechanism for suppression of CD8 1 T-cell proliferation and function (Dong et al., 1999; Kobata et al., 2000; Sharpe and Freeman, 2002) . Microglia are the foremost antigen presenting cells of the brain, as evidenced through their expression of MHC Class I and II in response to brain infection (Neumann, 2001; Sedgwick et al., 1993) . As previously reported (Magnus et al., 2005) , we found low basal expression of PD-L1 on microglia, approximately 20% of cells in uninfected mice expressed surface PD-L1 (Fig. 1) . PD-L1 expression on microglia increased robustly during the acute stage of infection, coinciding with the infiltration of IFN-g-secreting CD8 1 T-cells and increased CNS TNFa (Cheeran et al., 2007) . Similarly, IFN-g and TNFa treatment increased PD-L1 on in vitro cultured microglia, confirming the role of those cytokines in PD-L1 upregulation (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, we found that blockade of the PD-1 pathway with either PD-1 or PD-L1 neutralizing antibody, both in vitro and in ex vivo brain leukocyte extracts, resulted in increased CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g and IL-2 production. These data demonstrate that microglia suppress CD8 1 T-cell function, as indicated by IFN-g and IL-2 production, through the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway.",

To demonstrate this, in Fig. 5 , we assessed the effects of glialexpressed PD-L1 on CD8 1 T-cells isolated from the brains of MCMV-infected mice at 14 dpi. In this experiment, we used a MHC Class I restricted peptide for specific CD8 1 Tcell restimulation (MCMV IE1 168-176 ).

Similarly, Duncan et al. showed that microglia in the CNS during active Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, which is used as a model for multiple sclerosis, upregulate PD-L1. Using neutralizing antibody to PD-L1, they showed that ex vivo microglia suppressed CD4 1 and CD8 1 T-cell cytokine production through engagement of the T-cell PD-1 receptor. In vivo blockade of PD-L1, again using neutralizing antibody, resulted in decreased viral loads, but also caused an increase in mortality, presumably through exacerbated immune-mediated damage to the nervous system (Duncan and Miller, 2011) . Although these previous studies have primarily focused on PD-L1 in managing T-cell function during acute viral CNS infection, the present study shows the involvement of this negative regulatory pathway in inhibiting persistent CD8 1 T-cell function during postviral encephalitic chronic neuroinflammation. Specifically, treatment of isolated BMNCs, consisting of microglia and brain-infiltrating leukocytes, with PD-L1 neutralizing antibody increased the production of IFN-g and IL-2 from MCMV-IE1 168-176stimulated memory CD8 1 T-cells (Fig. 5) . These experiments were performed on cells extracted from MCMV-infected brains at 14 dpi, approximately 1 week following the clearance of active viral infection. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment demonstrating the role of microglial PD-L1 on inhibiting brain CD8 1 T-cells during chronic neuroinflammation and in the absence of productive viral infection.",

In this study, we corroborate previous findings that IFN-g robustly upregulates MHC Class II expression on purified cultures of murine astrocytes. In addition, we report that IFN-g stimulation-induced PD-L1 upregulation on purified astrocytes in vitro, suggesting the involvement of astrocytes as an additional immunosuppressive cell type. Indeed, Pittet et al. have previously shown that IFN-g stimulation of purified cultures of human astrocytes-induced surface PD-L1 expression, which suppress T-lymphocytes via engagement of PD-1 on the FIGURE 7: Astrocytes inhibit CD8 1 T-cell cytokine production through PD-1: PDL-1. (A, B) CD8 1 T-cells were either untouched (untreated) or stimulated with anti-CD3 Abs for 1 h prior to transfer into co-culture with purified astrocytes (anti-CD3 stimulated CD8 cells). Astrocyte cultures were pretreated for 8 h with IFN-c (200 U/mL) to stimulated PD-L1 expression. CD8 1 T-cells were added at a 10:1 CD8: Glial cell ratio. Prior to CD8 1 T-cell addition, astrocyte cultures were left untreated (control) or treated for 2 h with a-PD-L1, a-PD-L2, or a-PD-1 neutralizing antibody. Treatment with rat IgG2a was used as an isotype antibody control. Supernatants were collected at 24 h and ELISA run for IFN-c (A) and IL-2 (B). Histograms are representative of three separate experiments. *P 0.01, **P 0.001. surface of CD8 cells (Pittet et al., 2011) . Furthermore, we confirmed that astrocytes regulate T-cells by inhibiting CD8 1 T-cell cytokine production through the physical engagement of T-cell-expressed PD-1 and glial-expressed PD-L1 (Gold et al., 1996) . As techniques for isolating and culturing astrocytes from the brains of adult mice become available, ex vivo verification of T-cell suppression by astrocytes by this pathway will be required. Multiple studies have clearly shown that, in relation to effector T-cell stimulation, microglia are superior to astrocytes. IFNg induces microglia expression of T-cell costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) that are necessary second-signals for glia to functionally activate T-cells (Aloisi, 2001) . To our knowledge, there have been no reports of astrocytes either expressing these co-stimulatory molecules or being able to effectively activate T-cells (Cross and Ku, 2000) . Studies by Magnus et al., suggest that while astrocytes and microglia both inhibit T-cell function, the effect is more pronounced in the latter cell type (Magnus et al., 2005) . Our in vitro studies show that PD-L1 neutralization resulted in more potent recovery of CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g production in astrocyte co-cultures (2.4-fold increase) compared with microglia co-cultures (1.5-fold). PD-L1 neutralization had comparable effects on IL-2 production in both microglia and astrocyte co-cultures. These data suggest a more potent role for astrocytes in CD8 1 T-cell suppression in the brain. Such conclusions, however, cannot be drawn from the experiments conducted in this study because of our inability to assess the percentage of PD-L1 expression on astrocytes in the postencephalitic brain or to evaluate the effect of PD-L1 neutralization on astrocytes using ex vivo glial: BMNC co-cultures.",
