Although suppressor T cells were first described in the 1970s [1], their identity and the molecular basis of their mechanism of action was difficult to validate in the 1980s, and interest in these cells waned. Recently, however, the importance of these cells in autoimmunity and transplantation tolerance has been rediscovered and has led to a renaissance in their investigation [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. T suppressor cells have been renamed T regulatory (Tr) cells and consist of a network of diverse populations that include CD4+, CD8+, CD4\u2212, CD8\u2212 (double negative), \u03b3\u03b4, and natural killer T (NKT) cell.",

A lack of appreciation of the heterogeneity of CD25+ cells has led to a controversy concerning the role of TGF\u2010\u03b2 in the mechanism of action of CD4+ CD25+ Tr cells. Some groups have described latent TGF\u2010\u03b2 bound to the cell surface of CD4+ CD25+ cells and consider this cytokine important in the mechanism of action [20, 21]. Others, however, deny a role for TGF\u2010\u03b2 in the mechanism of action since the suppressive activity of CD4+ CD25+ cells is intact in mice that are genetically unable to produce or respond to TGF\u2010\u03b2 [22]. Unfortunately, there are no markers that distinguish the naturally occurring, thymus\u2010derived CD4+ CD25+ subset (Trn) from activated, TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010producing Tr cells generated in the periphery. Because the relative percentages of Trn cells and Tr2 cells may vary in different lymphoid organs, we suspect that the present controversy regarding the role of TGF\u2010\u03b2 in the mechanism of action of CD4+ CD25+ cells is attributable to a heterogeneity of CD4+ CD25+ cells studied, as well as differences in the experimental methods used. As discussed below, we have also shown that CD4+ CD25\u2212 cells activated in the presence of TGF\u2010\u03b2 become CD25+ Tr2 cells that have a phenotype indistinguishable from Trn cells [23].",

First, CD4+ CD25+ Trn cells facilitate the generation of Tr1 cells and Tr2 cells by a phenomenon known as \u201cinfectious tolerance\u201d [25, 26, 27]. Second, while Trn cells primarily target CD8+ cells and prevent them from becoming activated and developing cytotoxic activity [28, 29], our laboratory has found that CD8+ Tr cells primarily target CD4+ cells and prevent their expansion following antigenic stimulation [30]. The converse was also true; CD8+ Tr cells were not as potent as CD4+ Tr cells in suppressing CD8+ cells. Therefore, although the functional activities of all Tr subsets overlap, we suggest that each probably targets certain cell populations. Finally, our view that Tr subsets can be grouped into specific subsets must be viewed with some caution. The properties of the various Tr subsets described to date have been elucidated from in vitro studies. One cannot exclude the possibility that Trn cells or the Trn\u2010like cells described herein, which have cytokine\u2010independent mechanism of action, become cytokine\u2010producing cells following adoptive transfer in vivo.",

Moreover, mouse Tr cells generated ex vivo with IL\u20102 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 proliferate when transferred to nonlymphopenic syngeneic mice [35]. Trn cells and Tr2 cells can retain their suppressive properties after exposure to IL\u20102, whereas Tr1 cells lose this function when anergy is broken and become Th cells (Horwitz et al., unpublished results).

High\u2010affinity binding favors Th or Trn differentiation, while, as stated above, altered peptide ligands with decreased binding affinity favor the development of Tr\u20102 cells [32]. Antigen\u2010presenting cells (APC), dendritic cells (DC) in particular, have a major role in T cell differentiation. DC1 and DC2 subsets control the generation of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively [36]. Some workers have proposed that another dendritic cell subset (DCr) that secretes IL\u201010 rather than IL\u201012 directs na\u00efve T cells to a Tr1 subtype [36, 37].

CD4+ cells become Tr1 cells when repeatedly stimulated with IL\u201010 or with immature dendritic cells. These IL\u201010\u2010producing Tr1 cells have strong suppressive effects, both in vitro and in vivo [14, 15, 39]. CD8+ cells activated by immature dendritic cells also become Tr1 cells [24, 40]. The role of IL\u201010 in their mechanism of action appears pivotal because neutralizing anti\u2010IL\u201010 antibodies completely block the generation of Tr1 cells [24]. In all examples, the IL\u201010\u2010conditioned CD4+ T cells became unresponsive to antigen and lost the capacity to produce IL\u20102. In addition to producing high levels of IL\u201010, they also produced moderate amounts of TGF\u2010\u03b2 and low levels of Th1 or Th2 cytokines [14]. Tr1 cells suppressed the activation of cocultured T cells in an antigen nonspecific fashion.

Using a model in which we could induce T cell\u2010dependent antibody production without accessory cells, we found that CD4+ cells, by themselves, could not induce CD8+ cells to suppress antibody production. The addition of NK cells to the cultures, however, led to potent suppressor activity. Subsequent studies revealed that NK cells produced active TGF\u2010\u03b2 when they interact with CD8+ cells, and this cytokine was needed for CD8+ cells to become suppressors of antibody production [56, 57]. In other studies, a brief exposure of CD8+ cells to IL\u20102 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 led to potent suppressive activity. In unpublished studies, we have found that the suppressive activity is of CD8+ cells is cytokine dependent and that neutralizing anti\u2010TGF\u2010\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies sometimes, but not always, abolishes suppressive activity. Because others have shown that CD8+ suppressor cells can produce IL\u201010 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 [24, 55], it is likely that both cytokines have an important role in the suppressive effects of these cells.",

Recent studies from our laboratory have revealed that stimulation of CD4+ CD25\u2212 cells with low\u2010dose staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and TGF\u2010\u03b2 induces a CD25+ Tr subset that produces TGF\u2010\u03b2, but not IL\u20102, IFN\u2010\u03b3, or IL\u201010 [23]. The addition of 5% of these CD4+ CD25+ cells markedly suppressed T cell\u2010dependent antibody production by a mechanism that was TGF\u2010\u03b2 dependent. Anti\u2010TGF\u2010\u03b2 completely blocked the suppressive activity of these cells. The cytokine profile and mechanism of action of this subset, therefore, was clearly distinguishable from other Tr subsets. Moreover, TGF\u2010\u03b2 not only was responsible for the generation of this Tr subset, but it protected them from apoptosis upon further stimulation. Interestingly, the low dose of SEB used to induce T cell activation stimulated CD4+ CD45RO+ cells, but not the CD45RA+ na\u00efve subset. This result suggests that we had induced CD4+ previously activated effector or memory cells to develop regulatory activity. Further studies will be performed to learn whether T cells previously polarized to become Th1 or Th2 cells can become Tr2 cells. Others have described a small subset of mouse CD4+CD25\u2212 cells that express the latent form of TGF\u2010\u03b2 on their cell surface, and these cells have suppressive activity mediated by this cytokine [62].

We agree with Papiernik and co\u2010workers who have suggested that IL\u20102 has an essential role in the generation of suppressor T cells [63]. Although IL\u20102 was originally described as a T cell growth factor, mice with a deficiency of this cytokine or a functional IL\u20102 receptor develop a lethal lymphoproliferative and autoimmune syndrome [64, 65, 66, 67]. This syndrome can be corrected directly by the adoptive transfer of CD4+ CD25+ cells, or indirectly by the transfer of CD4+ CD25\u2212 cells. Presumably, the latter provide the IL\u20102 that is needed for the generation of the suppressor cells. An aggressive lethal lymphoproliferative and autoimmune syndrome also occurs in TGF\u2010\u03b21 knockout mice [68]. Nonetheless, CD4+ suppressor cell precursors apparently develop in both IL\u20102 and TGF\u2010\u03b21\u2010deficient mice. IL\u20102 signaling enables CD4+ CD25+ from IL\u20102\u2010deficient mice to develop suppressive activity [69]. Similarly, CD4+ CD25+cells from TGF\u2010\u03b21\u2010deficient mice can suppress wild\u2010type T cells [22]. In this case the wild\u2010type antigen\u2010presenting cells could serve as a source of TGF\u2010\u03b2. Thus, both IL\u20102 and TGF\u2010\u03b21 could be maturation factors for suppressor cell precursors. While IL\u20102 would promote the growth of these cells, TGF\u2010\u03b2 would protect them from activation\u2010induced apoptosis.",

We have confirmed these observations in unpublished studies. Groux and co\u2010workers have reported one mechanism that involves this synergy. They found that newly activated T cells avoid the inhibitory effects of TGF\u2010\u03b2 by down\u2010regulating the signal transducing TGF\u2010\u03b2 receptor (TGF\u2010\u03b2RII) [73]; this would enable T cells to respond optimally to microbial antigens. This finding is consistent with our observation that the addition of TGF\u2010\u03b2 to T cells more than 24 h after they are activated markedly diminishes their ability to become suppressor cells [56, 57]. Remarkably, Groux et al. reported that IL\u201010 is responsible for the re\u2010appearance of TGF\u2010\u03b2RII [73]. Thus, the late appearance of IL\u201010 after the peak of T cell activation restores the sensitivity of these cells to TGF\u2010\u03b2. In this manner, the combined inhibitory effects of IL\u201010 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 act together to terminate T cell activation.",

For example, there is a marked imbalance of IL\u201010 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Levels of IL\u201010 are high, while lymphocyte production of TGF\u2010\u03b2 is decreased [79, 80]. This imbalance may strongly contribute to dysregulated polyclonal B cell activation characteristic of SLE. In autoimmune pancreatitis, a loss of TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling accelerates the progression of this disease [81]. In turn, TGF\u2010\u03b2 mediated fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis is enhanced in animals that are unable to produce IL\u201010 [82].

Baecher\u2010Allan and co\u2010workers have shown that strongly activated T cells are refractory to the inhibitory effects of CD4+ CD25+ Tr cells [83]. Thus, Tr cells could not block T cells from responding to potent microbial antigens but could inhibit a weaker response to self\u2010antigens. The second mechanism involves the innate immune system. Both antigen\u2010presenting cells and CD4+ CD25+ cells express Toll\u2010like receptors (TLR\u20104). These pattern receptors are triggered by microbial products. The resulting signals induce antigen\u2010presenting cells to produce IL\u20106 and other cytokines, which block the suppressive effects of CD4+CD25+ Tr cells, thereby, allowing T cells to respond maximally to the infectious agent [84]. Triggering TLR\u20104 expressed by CD4+ CD25+ cells markedly enhances the proliferation and suppressive activity of these regulatory T cells [85].

Here, Tr cells induced with polyclonal T cell activators can be tested. For diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, antigen\u2010specific Tr would have a much better chance of success. Previously, collagen\u2010specific Tr cells were induced by oral tolerance in anticipation that they would migrate to the rheumatoid joint, where they would be activated by endogenous type II collagen and inhibit joint inflammation via bystander suppression. Oral tolerance, however, had only modest beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis [87], presumably because of an inadequate number of Tr cells generated. It is possible that collagen\u2010specific Tr cells induced ex\u2010vivo may have greater clinical effects than those induced by oral tolerance. In addition to autoimmune diseases, Tr cells generated ex vivo to block IL\u20104 production deserve consideration in the treatment of patients with severe steroid\u2010dependent allergic asthma. Another possible use deserves comment. The host immune response against viral infections can result in severe tissue injury, as recently revealed by the SARS virus.
