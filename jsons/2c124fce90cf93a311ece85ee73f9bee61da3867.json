Their two major production sites are located in Split Unlike many other businesses, the DIV group introduced protective measures ahead of the Croatian Government. From 25 February, the company implemented hand disinfection stations in all rooms, as well as regular workstation cleaning protocols. All communal coffee and food vending stations were closed as well. From 3 March, all employees had to undergo temperature checks before entering the facility. From 11 March, eight days before national measures took place, they introduced specific internal measures that included self-isolation for those returning from abroad, work from home for part of the business and administrative staff and vacation for employees whose work could not be continued. The total number of employees working at the aforementioned facilities was reduced to around 1300 and 300, respectively. They also continually provided information and warnings for employees using multiple internal communication methods. Before this study, the company facility in Split reported a total of 7 confirmed cases, 20 employees with symptoms of COVID-19, and 52 employees in selfisolation in different periods. However, all the confirmed individuals were in contact with the virus outside off the factory premises while on vacation or working from home.",

Although RT-PCR tests are reliable to detect current infection and viral material, they cannot provide information on previous infection or exposure to the virus [18] . For this reason, and due to the lower financial and temporal demands, serological immunoassay tests have been recently introduced in studies [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Previously published studies, as well as unofficial study results, report various proportions of antibodies in studied samples, ranging from 2% to 30% [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . These results could indicate that differences may stem from the sampling strategy as well as the population studied, but also from the performances of serological tests.",

The previous study [26] addressed that even when test performance parameters are high, test results can be largely affected if incidence level in population is low. For example, the authors showed that an assumed test, with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 95%, could provide 640 positive and 9360 negative cases on a population of 10 000 with an incidence base rate of 2%. Out of the 640 positive cases, due to the test performance, 150 cases would be truly positive, while the other 490 would be truly negative. In contrast, out of the 9360 negative cases, 9310 would be truly negative, while 50 would be truly positive. The probability of a truly positive case yielding a positive test result would be calculated as the ratio between truly positive cases and all positive test results. A similar approach could be used to calculate the probability of a truly positive case that showed negative test results, as a ratio of truly positive cases tested negative and all cases with negative test results [26] . In this hypothetical case, the probability of a truly positive case testing positive would be 150/640, which would mean that only 23.44% of participants tested positive actually are positive cases. In contrast, the probability of truly positive cases testing negative would be 50/9360, which would imply that 0.53% of the participants tested negative would actually be positive [26] .",

Following the decrease of new daily confirmed cases and decrease of basic reproduction number to 0.8 [11], on 19 April the Croatian Government lifted the restriction of prohibiting citizens from leaving their place of residence. On 27 April, the Croatian Government also started the gradual loosening of measures in an attempt to reduce the negative economic impact [12]. The last official data by the Croatian Institute of Public Health (28 April 2020) reported a total number of 2 055 confirmed cases and 63 deaths [13].",

The study was performed between the23 to 28 of April 2020, in the last days before the loosening of national restrictive measures in Croatia. DIV Group organised the study in cooperation with the Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Center Split; University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split; and University of Split School of Medicine (Split, Croatia). To examine whether the results could be generalised to the counties' populations, the required sample size was calculated using the online sample size calculator (https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/) with a confidence interval of 95% and the margin of error of 5%. For Split-Dalmatia County (N = 454 798) the required sample size was 384, while for the \u0160ibenik-Knin County (N = 109 375), it was 383.",

According to the manufacturer's recommendations, the test results were (C -control line; Gtest line IgG; Mtest line IgM) read between 10 and 15 minutes. Each invalid test (no reaction on control line) and each positive test result was repeated at a different testing point (different test performer, lot, and buffer). All test results were entered into the form and photographically documented in the recommended time interval. If a participant tested positive, they were forwarded to the local epidemiologic service, where they would undergo additional confirmatory testing using RT-PCR. Crisis headquarters maintained further contact with physicians and epidemiologic services to receive information on final results. Additional information about the whereabouts and possible contacts of the positive participants were provided to the researchers by the crisis headquarters.",

To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the few reported studies of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using immunoassay tests, that have only been introduced recently [20-22]. The present research was primarily aimed at the population working at DIV Group facilities in Split and Knin and showed that 0.77 to 1.98% of the population had developed antibodies. As it was previously mentioned, some of the participants from Split are living inside the facility with more restrictions. Although differences between the Split sample living inside and outside the facilities could not be statistically compared, the results could suggest that the restriction of movement outside the facility (complete lockdown) additionally lowered the transmission factor.Overall, results on the company population level could be attributed to the early implementation of company protective measures combined with strict national measures, put in place to mitigate the COVID-19 spread.",
