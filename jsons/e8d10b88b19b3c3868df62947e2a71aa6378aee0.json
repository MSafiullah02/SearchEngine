Additionally, the PCA suggested that the different isolated strains were diverged from each other and did not locate on or around the origin of coordinate, which also explained that there exists mutational pressure in shaping the codon usage pattern. Furthermore, the results were confirmed by the correlation analysis between the nucleotide content (A%, TU%, G%, C%, GC%) and the codon compositions (A3s, U3s, C3s, G3s, GC3s), which each other had significant differences and existed positively correlation. For natural selection, only the Aroma score was slightly correlated with the ENC, and other indicies had no correlation, demonstrated that natural selection plays a role in the codon usage bias of SVS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 258, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Actually, the mutational pressure is considered as the major factor in shaping the codon usage variation compared with natural selection [37] . Thus, to determine which was responsible for the extreme codon usage bias in SVA, the GC12s and GC3s were plotted against the evolution time in an evolutional neutrality analysis, and the results revealed that the mutational pressure plays an increasing role in the SVA evolution compared with natural selection. In addition, the neutrality plot showed that the relationship between GC3s and GC12s was not significant, and the correlation coefficient indicated that compared with mutation pressure, natural selection is more important in codon usage bias of SVA. As shown in Fig. 2 , the 23 strains isolated from different location or dates were separated, suggesting that the geographic distribution and date of isolation may contribute to the codon usage pattern of SVA. To confirm this hypothesis, the relationship between the date or location of isolation and the ENC were analyzed, respectively.
