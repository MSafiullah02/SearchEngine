The multiple functions of the IFN system are thought to be an innate defense against microbes and foreign substances. The IFN system consists first of cells that produce IFNs in response to viral infection or other foreign stimuli and second of cells that establish the antiviral state in response to IFNs. This process of innate immunity involves multiple signaling mechanisms and activation of various host genes. Viruses have evolved to develop mechanisms that circumvent this system. IFNs have also been used clinically in the treatment of viral diseases. Improved treatments will be possible with better understanding of the IFN system and its interactions with viral factors. In addition, IFNs have direct and indirect effects on tumor cell proliferation, effector leukocytes and on apoptosis and have been used in the treatment of some cancers. Improved knowledge of how IFNs affect tumors and the mechanisms that lead to a lack of response to IFNs would help the development of better IFN treatments for malignancies.",

IFNs tend to be species-specific in their activation of cells. This process occurs with the activation of multiple signal transduction cascades like the NF-\u03baB/inhibitory factor \u03baB (I\u03baB) kinase complex and stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which converge in the nucleus to turn on a variety of immunoregulatory genes and proteins that together establish the antiviral state. Specifically, after IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 are transcribed and translated, they activate gene expression in adjacent cells by binding to cell surface IFN receptors ( Fig. 1) , which trigger activation of the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways (15). This allows heterodimers of STAT-1/2 to combine with IRF-9 to create IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) factor (ISGF)-3, which binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), which are found in different IFN-induced antiviral genes (15), including IRF-7, which adds to the amplification of the transcriptional response by starting a second wave of IFN gene expression, including other IFN-\u03b1 genes that were not induced during the early events after viral infection (16,17) . The IRF, STAT, and NF-\u03baB transcription factors then translocate to the nucleus and work together to activate a network of antiviral genes like double-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR), 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase, and the Mx proteins, which interfere with viral transcription and translation (5,15).",

In theory, treatment with IFNs should eliminate visible HPV lesions and the virus itself. Some studies have shown that type I IFN-\u03b1 is less effective than type I IFN-\u03b2 in treating HPV infection, perhaps related to the higher diffusibility of IFN-\u03b1. Compared with type I IFNs, type II IFN-\u03b3 is more effective (26). The differences in response may be explained by several factors, including varied levels of expression of HPV oncogenes, interactions between viral proteins and cellular factors that influence viral and host gene expression and function, and mutations found in infected cells that may decrease the IFN response.

The goals of IFN therapy are long-term suppression of HBV replication and viremia, improvement of liver function, and prevention of end-stage liver disease. Because they have an increased risk of progression to chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis and of hepatocellular carcinoma, patients who test positive for hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) are offered therapy (33,34). The benefits of IFN therapy in those patients who are asymptomatic HBeAg-negative chronic carriers with viral loads less than 10 5 genomes/mL and normal liver function test values are less clear and under investigation. Markers of effectiveness include the loss of HBeAg with seroconversion to anti-HBe positive status, decrease in viral load, and improvement in liver function tests, and this effectiveness is achieved in 30 to 46% of patients who tolerate IFN therapy (35). Seroconversion usually is correlated to improved histological findings in the liver and is normally maintained long term (36). In patients with cirrhosis, IFN-\u03b1 treatment also is associated with reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and reduction in mortality from decompensated cirrhosis (37). Loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and undetectable virus load after treatment, or true cure, is observed only in 1 to 5% of patients. However, true cures may increase over time after treatment.",

Combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy in all patient groups and especially in patients with characteristics that are associated with low virologic response rates, such as HCV genotype 1 infection, viremia greater than 800,000 IU/mL, increased quasispecies heterogeneity, mutation within the NS5A protein, previous nonresponse to IFN therapy, African-American ethnicity, older age, obesity, and renal impairment (39). The standard measure of favorable response to IFN therapy is sustained virologic response (SVR), or the absence of detectable serum HCV RNA by PCR (<50 IU/mL) 24 wk after completion of therapy, which is correlated with long-term histological improvement and clinical outcome (40). Treatment with pegylated IFN, which has a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety covalently bonded to an IFN backbone that increases IFN's halflife and improves its biological activity, has yielded increased rates of SVR compared with IFN therapy (41). In multicenter, international, randomized, controlled studies of pegylated IFN \u03b1-2b and of pegylated IFN \u03b1-2a, combination therapy with pegylated IFN and ribavirin for 48 wk increased SVR from 43% to 54-56% (42-44) . These trials also showed that those patients with baseline levels of HCV RNA less than 2 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL or 600,000 IU/mL, with less advanced fibrosis seen on pretreatment biopsy, with body weight of less than 75 kg, and with genotypes 2 and 3 were more likely to achieve SVR. Even though they are less likely to achieve SVR, patients with chronic hepatitis C who are at a higher risk for progression to cirrhosis also are encouraged to receive IFN treatment, including those patients with detectable serum HCV RNA, increased liver function test values, and moderate or greater inflammation of portal fibrosis on liver biopsy (45). The benefit of treatment for patients that do not meet the recommended criteria is less clear and should be considered on an individual basis. Also, patients who currently abuse alcohol or other substances or have severe psychiatric illness or co-morbidities, such as autoimmune or renal disease, are not candidates for IFN therapy (46).",

These symptoms diminish with repeated exposure and can be easily controlled with acetaminophen. Some infrequent neurological short-term adverse events include confusion, dizziness, dysarthria, motor weakness, paresthesia, and short-term memory loss. At higher doses, such as those used for treatment of HBV and HCV, depression and transiently elevated liver enzymes, which normalize within 2 to 5 d after therapy, are noted. This treatment modality has dose-related bone marrow suppression, which is reversible upon discontinuation.",

            "text": "IFNs are the first line of defense against viruses. However, viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade host surveillance by inhibiting the production and activity of IFNs. The molecular pathways of the IFN system are numerous. The interpretation of the significance of each pathway probably should consider its frequency, magnitude, interactions, occurrence in different cell types, and its effect in vivo. Prophylaxis of viral infections with IFNs generally is more effective than therapy (5). Clinically, many ongoing viral infections and diseases inconsistently respond to IFN therapy and frequently recur after IFN treatment is stopped. However, the development of pegylated IFN for use in HCV infection has improved response rates in that disease. Molecular studies on IFN signaling pathways and viral effects on IFN responses help to elucidate viral pathogenesis and the interactions between the host factors that establish innate immunity. This increased understanding will allow the development of improved antiviral treatments, such as molecules that inhibit the evasive interactions and restore the IFN response.",

However, the use of IFN-\u03b1 inducers like imiquimod has increased response rates in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum, SCCs, and BCCs. Improved knowledge of the mechanisms of how IFN affects tumors and the factors that are responsible for a lack of response to IFNs would lead to an improved use of IFN in malignancies, including decreased toxicity with IFN therapy.",

However, for all cell types, stimulation of apoptosis by all IFN subtypes has involved fas-associated death domain (FADD)/caspase-8 signaling, launch of the caspase cascade, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, interference of mitochondrial potential, changes in plasma membrane symmetry, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation (50). Inhibitors of caspase-3, caspase-8, or dominant negative mutants of FADD in general can prevent IFN-induced cell death (52). IFN-induced apoptosis occurs relatively late (after 48 h of treatment), which suggests the involvement of genes activated by IFNs or intermediate cellular effectors.",
