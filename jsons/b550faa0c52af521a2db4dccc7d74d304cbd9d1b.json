Mucociliary clearance is the sinonasal cavity's most powerful protective mechanism through its expeditious removal of offending organisms. Once cleared from the sinonasal cavity, organisms enter the nasopharynx, which is an area devoid of mucociliary clearance, thus resulting in bacterial colonization and the possibility of retrograde sinonasal infection [7] . Bacterial colonization of the nasal vestibule with staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus) is quite common and can affect the quality of sinonasal cultures.

Because of the multitude of viral strains that can cause nasal and paranasal sinus inflammation, viral rhinosinusitis is quite prevalent. Pathogens in viral rhinosinusitis include more than 100 strains of rhinovirus, as well as influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Rhinovirus is the predominant etiology of the common cold and is capable of survival on surfaces for up to 4 days. When inoculation of the nasal cavity occurs with a virus-contaminated finger, infection will result in the majority of cases [7] . Clinically, patients experience a self-limiting illness lasting 3 to 7 days. Treatment is usually supportive with adequate hydration and nasal decongestants. Unfortunately, by creating ostiomeatal complex obstruction, impairing mucociliary clearance, and weakening mucosal integrity, viral rhinosinusitis predisposes patients to invasion of their nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa by trapped facultative aerobic bacteria and the development of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [10] [11] [12] [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 438, "end": 441, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 442, "end": 444, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1002, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1483, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1488, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1493, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1498, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Rhinosinusitis"}, {"text": "Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is a clinical condition characterized by nasal congestion and rhinorrhea for 7 to 14 days, but no more than 4 weeks.
