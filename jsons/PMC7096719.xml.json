Its theoretical basis is the central section theorem proposed by Aaron Klug in 19682: That is, the Fourier transform of a function projected along a certain direction is equal to the cross\u2010section function of the function whose Fourier transform passes through the origin and is perpendicular to the projection direction.",

            "text": "Structural biology was born in the middle of the last century. It is a discipline that elucidates life phenomena by studying the structure and function of biological macromolecules. At present, there are three kinds of commonly used structural biology research methods, namely, X\u2010ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cryo\u2010EM, which together constitute the basis of high\u2010resolution structural biology research. In the past half century, X\u2010ray crystallography has been dominant in structural biology. As of October 17, 2019, the crystal structures in the PDB database account for about 89% of the total, the NMR structures account for 8.2%, and the EM structures account for 2.5% (Figure 2). X\u2010ray crystallography is mainly applicable to proteins with molecular weight of 10~150 kDa. After decades of development and maturity, more than 140,000 protein structures have been resolved, which has become the main means to analyze the structure of biological macromolecules. NMR is often used to study proteins with molecular weight less than 80 kDa. The advantage of this method is that it can determine the structure of protein molecules in solution, and study the dynamic process and the corresponding energy change of biological samples. However, the application of NMR is limited due to the requirement of high sample concentration (usually at the mM level) and high stability. NMR structures are also at relatively low resolution.",

This has made cryo\u2010EM faster and more efficient, so that it can compete or even replace X\u2010ray crystallography in many aspects.4 Compared with traditional structural biology methods such as X\u2010ray crystallography and NMR, cryo\u2010EM has the following advantages: (a) it does not need crystals; (b) it is suitable for proteins and their complexes of large molecular weight; (c) it reduces radiation damage and maintains the native activity and functional state of samples, including posttranslational modifications; (d) multiple different conformational states can be captured in one experiment; (e) it is suitable for the structural analysis of membrane proteins such as GPCR and their complexes; (f) when encountering some structures that cannot be resolved by conventional X\u2010ray crystallography, cryo\u2010EM is still the mainstream. Of course, cryo\u2010EM also has its own shortcomings or defects: (a) cryo\u2010EM can only be used for a large protein complex, which generally requires a minimum of 150 kDa or even more than 300 kDa, otherwise, the protein is too small to find under the electron microscope; (b) the requirement of sample homogeneity is very high, it will be difficult to get good results if the protein is flexible; (c) the current resolution of cryo\u2010EM is about 3 \u00c5, and is below 3 \u00c5 only in a few cases, which is still a certain gap from the demand of pharmaceutical research and development (2 \u00c5).",

Electron microscopy imaging needs to be performed in a high vacuum, and the radiation damage of electrons to biological samples is very large. Therefore, in the following decades, scientists could only image biological samples through heavy metal salt staining.5 In 1968, De Rosier and Klug proposed and established the general concept and method of 3D reconstruction, and reported the 3D structure of the T4 phage tail,2 the first electron microscope structure. In order to reduce the radiation damage caused by high\u2010energy electrons, Taylor and Glaeser in 1974 proposed the use of cryo\u2010EM.6 The wheel of historical development is rolling forward! In 1981, Jacques Dubochet and his colleague Alasdair McDowall made a breakthrough in electron microscopy technology. They introduced the method of rapid freezing,7, 8 which quickly froze molecules in a single layer of vitreous state water. This solved the above two problems of high vacuum and radiation damage. The process of vitrification can not only keep the sample in its natural state, but also protects them from dehydration.5\n",

Also one needs to transform 2D images into 3D structure. Joachim Frank and his colleague, Marin van Heel, took the lead in using computational image processing techniques9, 10, 11 to calculate and average multiple image copies of biomacromolecules to improve the signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio. After obtaining 2D images with different angles, 3D reconstruction is carried out by computer software to analyze the 3D structure of biomolecules. By 1999, the resolution of 50S large subunit of Escherichia coli ribosome had been improved to 7.5 \u00c5.12 After about 2000, the number of electron microscope structures began to increase year by year, but the resolution was not high. However, after 2013, the number of structures analyzed by electron microscopy began to improve rapidly and the resolution also increased to near atomic level. The structure of \u03b2\u2010galactosidase reported in 2015 had a resolution of 2.2 \u00c5.13 Also, the resolution of the 20S proteasome14 and the 70S\u2010EF\u2010Tu complex15 were 2.8 \u00c5 and 2.9 \u00c5, respectively (Figure 3).",

With the yeast small subunit processome, for example, 4 \u03bcl of SSU processome at an absorbance of 0.6 mAU at 260 nm can make a sample20; (c) data collection of negative staining sample (sometimes omitting this step according to the situation); (d) freezing sample: This is very important and usually includes two steps, first load the sample on the grid to form a thin water film, and then quickly freeze. In most cases, water can be made glassy by immersing the grid into liquid ethane quickly by manual operation, which has the advantage that the sample can be close to the \u201cnatural\u201d state. Because biochemical reactions, especially some enzymatic reactions, take place rapidly, another method named fast mixing/spraying microfluidic chips21, 22, 23 has been developed in order to obtain the structural information of the intermediate state of the reaction. That is, mixing the two molecular systems in milliseconds, and then freezing them quickly so that one can capture the intermediate steps in the biochemical reactions. This method can achieve time resolution of tens of milliseconds, which is very suitable for studying short\u2010term biological events, such as ribosome recycling, translation initiation, and other processes.23, 24 Generally speaking, the sample concentration of soluble protein is about 1 mg/ml and membrane protein is about 5 mg/ml. Take eukaryotic ribosome for example, 3 \u03bcl of \u223c80 nM can make a sample25; (e) load the sample in the cryo\u2010EM; (f) screen sample: it is necessary to screen the sample before data collection to check whether the water in the sample is in a glassy state and whether the thickness of ice layer is appropriate. If there is a problem, the sample needs to be prepared again; (g) data collection: select good particles to take photos, and the minimum exposure technology must be used in the photography because the high\u2010energy electrons have radiation damage to the sample; (h) three\u2010dimensional reconstruction.",

The determination of their 3D structures is not only helpful to elucidate the mechanism of virus self\u2010assembly and infection, but also has guiding significance for drug design based on structure. The size of virus particles is larger than that of proteins, so it is more suitable to analyze their 3D structure with cryo\u2010EM. In 2018, Yuan et al.61 first reported the atomic resolution structure of the nucleocapsid of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV\u20102) of the herpesvirus \u03b1 family. They clarified the complex interaction mode and fine structural information of the nucleocapsid protein, and proposed the assembly mechanism of the nucleocapsid of the herpesvirus. In the same year, Song et al.62 revealed the cryo\u2010EM structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus and its receptor ACE2 complex. Yuan et al.63 revealed the structure and function of MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV spike proteins, providing a key 3D structure map for the follow\u2010up design of broad\u2010spectrum antibody and vaccine. In 2019, Liu et al.64 first reported the key mechanism of human herpesvirus genome packaging and the genome structure of the virus, which is helpful to prevent and control a variety of diseases caused by herpesvirus, and is expected to transform herpesvirus for targeted treatment. Wang et al.65 determined the cryo\u2010EM structure of African swine fever (ASF) virus capsid, with a resolution of 4.1 \u00c5, which revealed the basis of capsid stability and assembly, and opened a new way for the development of ASF vaccine.",

In 2019, Yang et al.66 reported the cryo\u2010EM structure of human \u03b3\u2010secretase in complex with a notch fragment, which revealed the structural basis of notch recognition, and is of great significance for \u03b3\u2010secretase to recruit amyloid precursor protein. Then, Zhou et al.67 reported the cryo\u2010EM structure of human \u03b3\u2010secretase in complex with transmembrane app fragment, which provided important support for the design of substrate specific inhibitors and the understanding of the function of \u03b3\u2010secretase and the pathogenesis of AD. In the same year, Gu et al.68 resolved the cryo\u2010EM structure of mammalian ATPase tetramer. This explained the structural composition pattern and molecular mechanism of mammalian ATPase, the synergistic relationship between respiratory chain complexes and the influence on the shape of mitochondrial cristae, which provided an important structural basis for the treatment of energy metabolism diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.",

In some innate immune cells, inflammasome can sense a series of stimuli, which can produce inflammatory response. The imbalance of inflammatory signals leads to a wide range of immune disorders leading to diseases such as gout, Crohn's disease and sepsis.69 In 2015, Hu et al.70 reported the cryo\u2010EM structure of PrgJ\u2010NAIP2\u2010NLRC4\u0394CARD complex (inflammasome) in mice, revealing the molecular mechanism of NLRC4 protein induced self\u2010activation in NAIP\u2010NLRC4. Zhang et al.71 reported the cryo\u2010EM structure of the activated NAIP2\u2010NLRC4 inflammasome and revealed its nucleated polymerization mode. In 2019, Sharif et al.72 analyzed the cryo\u2010EM structure of human NLRP3\u2010NEK7 complex, and revealed the molecular mechanism of NEK7 mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through the multi\u2010interface interaction with NLRP3 subunit. Wang et al.73, 74 reported the assembly, structure, and function analysis of plant NLR protein complex. This work revealed the key molecular mechanism of NLR function, promoted people's understanding of plant immune mechanism, and was a milestone event in plant immune research. Dong et al.75 reported the cryo\u2010EM structure of human TCR \u03b1/\u03b2 in complex with CD3 hexamer complex.

Therefore, cryo\u2010EM has been considered to be only useful for the structure determination of macromolecular complexes with molecular weight greater than 500 kDa.82 However, many drug targets are of low molecular weight. In recent years, cryo\u2010EM has developed rapidly, more and more high\u2010resolution structures less than 150 kDa have been resolved. In 2017, Khoshouei et al.83 introduced the voltage phase plate (VPP) into cryo\u2010EM. By doing so, they analyzed the structure of 64 kDa human hemoglobin, and pushed the lowest molecular weight limit of the electron microscope sample to a new height. In 2019, Hongwei Wang's group from Tsinghua University reported the high\u2010resolution structure of 52 kDa streptavidin with a resolution of 3.2 \u00c5, which is the smallest protein resolved by cryo\u2010EM.3 Although the phase plate technology needs to be further improved in imaging stability, it provides the possibility for cryo\u2010EM to break through the limit of small molecular scale.",

One of the keys is to further improve the resolution to about 2 \u00c5. The homogeneity of the sample and the flexibility of the particle interior are two limiting factors of the resolution. A nonhomogeneous sample will lead to difficulty in data processing, and may also damage the integrity of the structural information and reduce the resolution. At present, many cryo\u2010EM studies still use intuition to get structure through continuous multiple rounds of classification. We expect focused 3D alignment and classification methods to overcome this problem in the future. In addition, the resolution can also be improved by optimizing the grid preparation process, data acquisition, and data processing. Moreover, the further improvement of direct electronic detectors and phase plates, as well as the comprehensive upgrades of software and hardware, including more advanced optical lens systems and better detectors and algorithms, will enable us to enter the golden age of cryo\u2010EM, by then, the resolution will reach a new height.",
