Analysis of cytokine profiles in COVID-19 patients shows some similarities to secondary haemophagocytic syndrome (sHPS), with increased IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GM-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 [2]. In this uncommon and potentially fatal disorder, severe hyperinflammation is caused by uncontrolled proliferation and activation of macrophages, which secrete high amounts of inflammatory cytokines and show increased phagocytic activity [3]. Causes for this pathological immune activation can be genetic or secondary under sporadic conditions such as viral infection. This virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS) has been extensively studied, with severe complications often resulting in multiorgan failure and death. During several influenza pandemics such as 2009 influenza A H1N1, 1918 H1N1 and 1998 H5N1, VAHS was shown to represent an important contributor to associated respiratory failure and high lethality rates [4,5]. Findings from these cases showed involvement of a massive macrophage activation and rapid occurrence of multi-organ failure.",

Hence, a therapeutic combination of GM-CSF and IL-6 blockade in severe COVID-19 patients could avoid pulmonary complications and respiratory failure by inhibiting monocyte-macrophage recruitment/differentiation to the lung and blocking the main mediator of inflammatory response. Blockade of GM-CSF could even be delivered at initial phases of severe disease (upon admission) to avoid hyperinflammatory response and prevent the need of intensive care unit (ICU) admission for mechanic ventilation (Fig. 1\n).",

Otilimab, a fully human antibody against GM-CSF, developed by biotechnology company MorphoSys in cooperation with GlaxoSmithKline, is currently in phase III start in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Otilimab has shown promising results during initial developmental phases and might constitute a good therapeutic candidate in COVID-19, alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs such as IL-6 blockaders and anti-viral regimes.
