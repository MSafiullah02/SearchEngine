Import cases have been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and US 2-5, and the number of involved countries is increasing. Given the potential of the global outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) 6. The number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases has surpassed that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7, and there is no clear trend to decline. As of February 16, 2020, 70548 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in 31 provinces (municipalities and regions) in China, including 10644 fatal cases, 1770 death cases, and 7264 suspected cases 8. The mortality of 2019-nCoV is lower than that of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 7. However, the panic caused by this disease is not less than the previous two diseases.",

However, due to the lack of a better understanding of the inherent biological characteristics of COVID-19, no treatment scenarios or medicine can effectively control the disease. Symptomatic and routine antiviral treatments seem to be the only choice for clinicians. This circumstance leads to a long-term admission stay and prevents many suspected cases from being diagnosed and treated in the hospital. Moreover, few confirmed cases may progress rapidly after admission and die of multiple organ failure 11. Therefore, a better understanding of the risk factors related to poor outcomes could provide a better prospect for improving the clinical scenarios.",

The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV; 2) patients underwent CT scan more than one time. Diagnosis of 2019-nCoV was determined according to the following three methods: isolation of 2019-nCoV or at least two positive results by real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for 2019-nCoV or a genetic sequence that matches 2019-nCoV. Finally, a total of 118 consecutive laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patients (60 females, 58 males; mean age, 44.06 years \u00b1 13.62 [SD]; median age, 42.5 years; age range, 2-75 years), who underwent serial CT scans, were included. All available clinical and epidemic characteristics were collected. We characterized patients into four types: mild, common, severe and fatal based on the guidelines of 2019-nCoV (Trial Version 5) 16, proposed by the China National Health Commission. As the treatment regimens between different types were different, we divided the included patients into two groups: no-emergency group (mild type and common type) and emergency group (severe type or fatal type). The interval of follow-up CTs ranged from 2-7 days.",

All images were viewed on both lung (width, 1500 HU; level, -700 HU) and mediastinal (width, 350 HU; level, 40 HU) settings. Fourteen image features including the presence of ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, mixed GGO and consolidation, centrilobular nodules, architectural distortion, cavitation, tree-in-bud, bronchial wall thickening, reticulation, subpleural bands, traction bronchiectasis, intrathoracic lymph node enlargement, vascular enlargement in the lesion, and pleural effusions were evaluated. The detailed definitions of the above features were well documented in the previous study 17. We evaluated four types of distributions: the craniocaudal distribution (upper lung predominant, lower lung predominant, or no craniocaudal predilection), the transverse distribution (central, peripheral, or no transverse predilection); the lung region distribution (unilateral or bilateral) and the scattering distribution (focal, multifocal or diffuse). Focal was defined as a single lesion of abnormality, multifocal as more than one lesions, and diffuse as the involvement of most of the volume of one lung lobe. A CT score system was used to evaluate the extent of disease 18. We defined three imaging changes: no change, progress change, and improvement change. No change referred to no obvious changes presented in chest CT. Progress change referred to the presence of new lesions or the presence of extent involvement area during the treatment. Improvement change referred to the continually absorbed abnormities. We also evaluated the duration of imaging progress, which was calculated from the time of baseline CT or the time of CT showing new lesions to that of the CT showing abnormal imaging findings.",

Collectively, the numbers in different response groups were: 73 patients in good response group (4 emergency cases, 69 no-emergency cases), 28 in fair response group (3 emergency cases, 25 no-emergency cases), and 17 in poor response group (3 emergency cases, 14 no-emergency cases).

The differences in basal clinical characteristics and radiographic features between the two groups were analyzed and compared. No significant differences were found between the two groups in clinical characteristics such as sex, age, exposure history, onset symptoms, underlying disease, and clinical type at baseline (Table 1). The types, features, and distribution of lesions showed no significant differences between the two groups (Table 2). Based on the follow-up CT changes, no change, progress change, and improvement change showed statistically significant differences between the two groups (Table 2). The progress trend in abnormal imaging findings might indicate a poor/fair response (Figure 1), whereas the alleviated symptoms seen in the follow-up CT scans might indicate a good response (Figure 2). However, the imaging changes may not necessarily always match the changes in clinical symptoms. Five patients in the good response group but 1 patient in the poor/fair group presented an improvement in follow-up CT (Figure 3). Thus, the follow-up CT scans could help us evaluate the treatment response in most cases. For the 48 patients with progressive CT changes, we further compared the progress duration time in the two groups. The results showed that the duration of imaging progress was longer in the poor/fair group than that in the good group (P = 0.009).",

Clinicians equipped with epidemic prevention supplies from all around China continue to come to Wuhan to control the disease, indicating a serious situation. COVID-19 is biologically close to SARS-CoV with an R0 of approximately 2.2 9. The mortality of COVID-19 is 2.5%, based on the statistics report on Feb 16, 2020 in China, but the cure rate is reported to be only 15.4% in China. No fully proven antiviral scenario for the coronavirus exists to date. Early detection, diagnosis, and early isolation and treatment remain the basic effective strategies to fight the outbreak of COVID-19 19. Early detection and diagnosis can substantially control the transmission and reduce the confirmed cases with unknown routes of transmission (8 cases in our cohort) and family outbreak cases (15 cases in our cohort). Although the onset symptoms vary, fever (77.1%) and cough (53.4%) are the most common ones, which is consistent with previous studies 12, 14 and might help screen the suspected cases. However, the incubation period might be as long as 24 days 20. In this regard, it is of note that 2 patients had no onset symptoms in our cohort; however, the epidemic history and abnormal CT findings indicated the 2019-nCoV infection. This highlights the importance of scrutinizing the epidemic exposure history of patients in the clinic.",

We analyzed and compared the differences in basal clinical characteristics and radiographic features between the good response and poor/fair response groups. No specific factors were identified as risk factors for poor response, including age, underlying disease, and baseline clinical type. In this context, it is difficult for clinicians to take measures or change treatment scenarios to prevent potential progression by evaluating baseline conditions for a patient. In our study, 13 patients subsequently progressed from a non-emergency type to an emergency type (3 in fatal type and 10 in severe type).

However, the baseline CT findings do not help in identifying the patients who might progress later. It is clear that the follow-up CT changes can effectively evaluate and predict the later response. Of note is the observation that the imaging changes might not always match the changes in clinical symptoms. In our study, 1 patient presented an improvement in imaging change but poor response. The patient with type 2 diabetes was one of 13 patients who progressed from the common type group into the emergency group. The assumption was that the underlying disease condition might affect the response. On the contrary, 5 patients presented a progress imaging change but a good response. This may be explained by the improvement in clinical symptoms that preceded imaging. Another interesting finding was that the duration of imaging progress might be valuable in predicting the prognosis of patients with NCP. Our results emphasize the importance of follow-up CT scans.",
