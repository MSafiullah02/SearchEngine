Looking at the molecular machinery of life that began in the early 1930s, but truly modern molecular biology emerged with the uncovering of the structure of DNA in the 1960s (Meyer 2003; Morange and Cobb 2000). As a science that studies interactions between the molecular components that carry out various biological processes in living cells, an important idea in molecular biology states that information flow in organisms follows a one-way street: genes are transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into proteins. The molecular components make up biochemical pathways that provide the cells with energy, facilitate processing \u201cmessages\u201d from outside the cell itself, generate new proteins, and replicate the cellular DNA genome. For example, molecular biologists study how proteins interact with RNA during \u201ctranslation\u201d (the biosynthesis of new proteins), the molecular mechanism behind DNA replication, and how genes are turned on and off, a process called \u201ctranscription\u201d (Lodish et al. 1995).",

This field and its requisite technology took off in the 1990s with the Human Genome Project\u2019s effort to sequence billions of bases to unlock a new era of genetically informed medicine (Sawicki et al. 1993; Venter et al. 2001). The resulting science is still a work in progress \u2013 it turns out the genetic code a more complicated one than anticipated \u2013 but the technologies and companies helped it spawn are an impressive legacy. The Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) got its start during the Human Genome Project, as it produced single nucleotides (the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs that comprise the genetic code) and short oligonucleotide chains (or \u201coligos\u201d) to facilitate a massive sequencing effort around the world (Burns et al. 1996). Of course, sequencing technology has advanced dramatically in the intervening decades, but \u201cyou still need oligos to do the sequencing,\u201d explains Jerry Steele, IDT\u2019s Director of Marketing, \u201cespecially in the next generation sequencing space, sequencing and DNA synthesis go hand in hand.\u201d The current sequencing method of choice is Illumina, a process that frequently returns millions of bases of DNA sequence by reading distinct stepwise fluorescent signals associated with each base in a massively parallel array (Schadt et al. 2010; Nakamura et al. 2011). To distinguish genetic material from different samples (a few hundred are often run on the same plate), scientists label each sample\u2019s DNA extract with a distinct barcode (Hebert et al. 2003). With each barcode comprised of about ten nucleotides, the demand for synthetic DNA chains in the sequencing process is substantial (deWaard et al. 2008).",

            "text": "The interdisciplinary field of research on biosystems at the nanoscale involving physical sciences, molecular engineering, biology, biotechnology, and medicine supplements knowledge of the synthesis of new drugs and their targeted delivery, regenerative medicine, neuromorphic engineering, and developing a sustainable environment (Roco 2003). The diagnostics for early cancer detection have been made successful by the dendritic polymers, multicolor quantum dots, nanocarriers, and diagnostic markers (Ferrari 2005; Smith et al. 2006; Wolinsky and Grinstaff 2008; Majoros et al. 2008; Peer et al. 2007; Visintin et al. 2008). Gold nanoparticles play a major role in cancer therapeutics owing to its enhanced surface plasmon resonance (Huang et al. 2007; Kah et al. 2007). DNA delivery into cell applications employs silica nanoparticles (Roy et al. 2005; Kneuer et al. 2000; Slowing et al. 2008; Zhu et al. 2002). Another interesting area of research is to realize biocompatible implants for replacing damaged or worn body parts with improved tissue engineering at the nanoscale and extend its arms for building up bioartificial organs (McIntire 2002; Mendon\u00e7a et al. 2008; Variola et al. 2009), nano-hydroxyapatite being a reliable candidate for bioimplants due to its excellent biocompatibility (Zhou and Lee 2011; Wang et al. 2012). Nanobiological devices and biocompatible electronic systems for detection and control, implants of wireless systems, neuroprostheses, and parts of the neural system form the part of molecular biology applications (PROKOP 2001; Gillies et al. 2002; Mercanzini et al. 2010; Tok\u00e1rov\u00e1 et al. 2013). There is an interesting classification of nanotechnology in two classes, \u201cwet\u201d nanotechnology (living biosystems) and \u201cdry\u201d nanotechnology. The systematic approaches are important in engineering man-made objects at the nanoscale for integrating them into large-scale structures which are similar to that of nature (Sarikaya et al. 2003; Alivisatos 2004). Interestingly, this booming field is also known as biomimicry or bionics where researchers get the idea from nature by mimicking them to be explored in various applications (Chakrabarti and Shu 2010; Quinn and Gaughran 2010). Few examples of such concepts can be lotus effect, pearl effect, Gecko effect, butterfly wings, Namib desert beetle, spider web, and so on (Bhushan 2009; Pereira et al. 2015). These biomimetic ideas were adopted for the successful fabrication of Velcro, self-cleaning tiles, desert fog harvesting, water filters, adhesives, nano-paints, etc. (Bhushan and Jung 2011; Vierra 2011; Ivani\u0107 et al. 2015; Diamanti and Pedeferri 2015; Weiler and Goel 2015). Some of the companies that are involved in the development and commercialisation of nanomaterials in biological and medical applications are listed below (Table 16.1) (Salata 2004).\n",

Nanomedicine is the application of nanotechnology in different areas of medicine and biology (Andrew 2000). Nanomedicine ranges from the biomedical applications of nanomaterials and biological devices to nanoelectronic biosensors and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology such as biological machines (Nie 2010; Vinogradov and Wei 2012; Jain and Stylianopoulos 2010). Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials (Nel et al. 2006; Hardman 2006; Dreher 2004; Colvin 2003; Jia et al. 2005). The size of nanomaterials is similar to that of most biological molecules and structures; therefore, nanomaterials can be useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications (Salata 2004). More than just an extension of \u201cmolecular medicine,\u201d nanomedicine will employ molecular machine systems to address medical problems and will use molecular knowledge to maintain and improve human health at the molecular scale (Freitas 2002; Freitas 2005; Kostarelos 2006; Bogunia-Kubik and Sugisaka 2002). Nanomedicine will have extraordinary and far-reaching implications for the medical profession, in the definition of disease and in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions including aging, and ultimately for the improvement and extension of natural human biological structure and function.",

Research on humans and animals indicates that some nanoparticles are able to enter the body and rapidly migrate to the organs via the circulatory and lymphatic systems. The ability of nanoparticles to enter cells and affect their biochemical function makes them important tools at the molecular level. For example, nanoparticles used to destroy cancer cells or nanoparticles used for soil remediation may have an impact upon entering the food chain via microorganisms, such as bacteria and protozoa. We conclude that the development of nanotechnology is indispensable in the modern molecular biology.",
