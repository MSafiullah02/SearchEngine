Since the microscope became a practical tool during the 1930's, electron microscopy in general has benefited from techniques developed for the study of viruses in particular. Virology, in its turn, has progressed enormously as morphology has become available as an important aid to the better understanding of virus particles. The technique of shadow-casting was developed so that greater contrast could be obtained with virus particles, thin sectioning was advanced by the need to obtain better resolution on virus particles within cells, and the potential of the negative staining technique was only fully appreciated when it was applied to the study of virus fine structure. It is therefore not surprising that the field which we shall be discussing here, and which may be termed immune electron microscopy, was first developed specifically for visualizing the interaction of antibody molecules with virus particles.",

I n addition antigens can be located with accuracy within a larger structure such as a virus particle because the attachment of the antibody molecule to its corresponding antigen is actually visualized. Since the antibody molecule itself is visualized it is possible to carry out morphological studies both on the complete molecule and on the products of enzyme digestion. More recently it has been shown that it is possible to study not only the simpler systems with antibody and virus alone, but also the three component interaction between virus, antibody, and complement.",

At this time the microscope itself was still in the developmental stage and such contrast as was obtained in these early micrographs was due simply to the small difference in density between the supporting film where no virus was present and the particles themselves. It is therefore a matter of wonder that under these conditions Anderson and Stanley (1941) carried out an electron microscope study on the reaction between tobacco mosaic virus and its antibody, and were able to show that meaningful results could be obtained with this approach. They found that there were demonstrable morphological differences between particles treated with specific antisera and those treated with control or nonspecific sera; they also went on to discuss aspects of lattice formation. This work was carried out some 30 years ago, and although we have microscopes with much better resolving power and techniques capable of providing greatly increased contrast, it is only now :hat we are beginning to take these pioneering studies a stage further.",

This technique is valuable in that it allows three-dimensional studies to be carried out with the electron microscope; but it has the severe limitation that, because metal is evaporated onto the surface of the specimen, the resolution obtained can never be better than the granularity of the metal used. Under optimum conditions this resolution will be in the region of 25A (Bradley, 1961) , a value that is not good enough when the molecules to be examined have dimensions of the same order. I n addition the technique of shadow-casting requires that the specimens be dried down onto the grid and placed under vacuum before the metal can be evaporated onto the surface; such a procedure cannot but be traumatic for the delicate three-dimensional structures formed by antigen and antibody.",

This method was introduced by Brenner and Horne (1959) and overnight revolutionized the electron microscopy of viruses. Unlike shadow-casting the contrast is obtaincd by mixing the particles with a solution containing a heavy metal, generally phosphotungstic acid (PTA), which on drying down yields a more or less amorphous appearance and provides the contrast necessary to visualize the fine structure of the virus. I n addition it appears from other work (Almeida e t aZ., 1966) that, when dry, the particles are surrounded and supported by a protein-phosphotungstate complex that will help to retain the original form of the particle or complex to be studied in a way that could never be achieved with shadow-casting. Its greatest importance in the present context is the fact that the method allows high resolution examination of the surface of particles and therefore of any structures attached to the surface. More specifically, if the virus has been exposed to antiserum, any antibody molecules attached to the surface will be visualized.",

Lafferty and Oertelis used influenza virus for their antigen and were able not only to show distinctive changes on the virus projections when antibody was present but also to resolve individual antibody molecules. Anderson and his associates used mixed preparations of poliovirus and bacteriophages and showed that the particles, which are easily distinguishable morphologically, were aggregated only by their specific antisera. These experiments showed conclusively that the negative staining procedure could be used for selected types of immune reaction, and that the changes in the appearance of the virus particles after treatment with immune serum were the specific consequence of interaction with antibody.",

For example, using wart virus, for which there is no biological assay and which is obtainable only in such limited amounts that techniques such as complement fixation are usually too wasteful, 0.2 ml of a suspension containing approximately lo* virus particles per milliliter was mixed with 0.7 ml of physiological saline and 0.1 ml of the antiserum to be tested. After thorough mixing this was held a t 37\u00b0C for 1 hour and then left overnight a t 4\u00b0C. The following morning the complex was spun a t 10,000 rpm for half an hour and the pellet was used for negative staining. The speed a t which the antigen-antibody aggregate is spun must of course depend on the size of the virus, e.g., poliovirus plus antibody would need approximately 1 hour a t 15,000 rpm, whereas a vaccinia-antibody complex can be spun down with ease in a clinical-type bench centrifuge. The much smaller centrifugal force needed for spinning down the complex as compared to the individual virus can be used as a means of improving the virus-to-background ratio with difficult viruses. For example, it allows rubella virus to be sedimented a t speeds which are ineffective with the untreated virus.",

The electron-dense PTA surrounds the particle rather than penetrates it, and contrast is obtained simply by the fact that the electronscattering ability of the virus particle is low compared to the background of PTA and is seen i s a hole in the dense substrate. However, since the PTA appears amorphous it is possible to delineate not only the overall outline but also the detail on the surface of the particle. By this means many viruses have been shown to display a definite symmetry either on the surface or in an internal component. Even when symmetry has not been shown other distinctive features are present on the virus particle, for example, the projections on the surface of coronaviruses (Almeida e t al., 1968) which allow them to be recognized with ease. The most obvious effect of antibody is the obscuring of this clear-cut and distinctive fine structure. This, together with clumping, produces an unmistakable effect so that antibody-treated virus presents a very different picture from that of the untreated control. Figures 1 and 2 show the appearance of wart virus particles before and after they have been reacted with specific antiserum. In Fig. 1 the particles display sharp outlines and it is possible to observe the arrangement of subunits forming the capsid. It should aIso be noted that although there is a high concentration of virus in this micrograph the particles are randomly distributed throughout. In Fig. 2 , on the other hand, the particles are obscured and even appear fuzzy, although the micrograph would be considered as showing good FIG. 1.

Native (N) virus, on the other hand, appears full with no rim around the edge. Using specific anti-N and anti-H antiserum these workers showed that the aggregates in each case were composed of particles having the expected morphological form of the group. Shortly after this two other groups of workers also showed that the changes seen in the electron microscope were specific ones. Almeida et al. (1963) used mixtures of wart and polyoma virus, which are similar in appearance but slightly different in size. To this mixture of viruses was added antiserum to polyoma virus alone, and it was only the smaller particles that became obscured and clumped by the presence of antibody molecules ( Fig. 4) . Lafferty and Oertelis (1963) used influenza virus as their system, and showed that influenza A virus changed markedly in appearance after the addition of influenza A antiserum, while the morphologically identical influenza B virus remained unaltered after the addition of the same antiserum but showed a positive reaction after the addition of antiserum to influenza of the B group.",

I n our own laboratory we found a problem of this type with wart virus systems for which there is no biological assay. I n this case immunodiffusion showed that precipitin lines could be obtained with the sera of roughly 50% of patients with warts, but since neutralization assays were not possible the only way to show that the antigen component of the line was virus was to examine the antigen-antibody mixture in the electron microscope, with the result, in this particular case, that the reaction was shown to be wholly dependent on the virus particles ( Fig. 5 ) (Almeida and Goffe, 1965) . I n this example we examined a parallel preparation to the one that had been used for immunodiffusion. But this approach can be taken a step further and if the immune reaction has been established by means of the agar gel immunodiffusion technique it is possible to cut out the precipitin lines and use them for negative staining thus leading to positive identification of the components taking part in the reaction. Watson and Wildy (1963) used this method for the identification of herpes capsids, and Beale and Mason (1968) were able to show which precipitin line in a poliovirus-agar gel system belonged to the H and which to the C component.",

It frequently happens that the ratio of virus particles to background material cannot be changed because the contaminating debris is roughly the same size or density, or both, as the virus. Density gradient centrifugation may well be the answer in such cases, but frequently there is not enough material of sufficiently high titer for this technique to be feasible. However, if, the virus, after partial purification, is mixed with antiserum to produce aggregates of virus it is then possible to spin a t a much lower speed than would be necessary to sediment individual virus particles, thus leaving in the supernatant the low molecular weight material which is a much greater problem to electron microscopy than the large, easily recognizable debris. Using this approach we were able to identify with certainty for the first time the virus of rubella (Best et al., 1967) , an agent which had proved to be one of the most difficult of the human pathogens to characterize morphologically. The reason for this was only appreciated after the virus had been seen in large antibody-bound rafts which left no doubt about the identity of the virus for, individually, the particles exhibited none of the distinctive symmetry features usually associated with virus particles (Fig. 6 ) . I n this example the problem of centrifugation was a very real factor, as it is only with difficulty that individual rubella particles can be sedimented, whereas the rubella-antibody aggregates can be spun down a t the relatively low speed of 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes in the SS 34 rotor of the Sorvall RC 2B centrifuge.",

There is a possibility that a small population of heteroligating antibodies may be present in any one preparation, so the occurrence must be shown to be reproducible before being finally accepted.

Probably the first realistic appraisal of the precipitin curve came from Marrack in 1938 when he put forward the lattice theory of immune complex formation. This theory was further developed in 1940 by Pauling, and the views put forward a t that time, have, with slight modification, remained valid until the present day (Humphrey and White, 1964) . The lattice theory offers an explanation as to why flocculation should occur around the region of equivalence, when antigen and ~~ FIG. 6.

In 1963 Almeida e t al. discussed the results obtained from immune electron microscopy when wart and polyoma viruses were combined with antiserum in concentrations ranging from extreme antigen excess through to antibody excess. These showed a close similarity to the diagrammatic drawings of the lattice formation as developed by Pauling (1940). In the region of extreme antigen excess only a few antibody molecules could be seen attached to virus particles. Linking between virus particles could be seen to have occurred by small numbers of antibody molecules on one virus particle becoming attached by the free binding site a t the other end of the molecule to another virus particle (Fig. 10) . With rising antibody concentration, al- (Humphrey and White, 1964.) though still in the region of antigen excess, the size of these aggregates increased ( Fig. 11 ). At and around the equivalence region the specimen consisted almost entirely of large rafts of antibody-linked virus (Fig.  12) , most of which were too large and, because of three-dimensional build-up, too dense for useful photographic record. As the region of antibody excess was approached large aggregates remained but a change could be seen in their formation. Available antigenic sites on the virus particles were fully occupied by antibody molecules and hence crosslinking between particles by antibody molecules was no longer possible. The aggregation that did occur at this stage was due to entanglement of the antibody halos around separate virus particles (Fig. 13) , and would seem to be dependent on the amount of centrifugation to which the complex had been subjected; if not centrifuged, no aggregation occurred. That two different kinds of linkage did occur on the antigen excess and antibody excess side of the curve was verified by measuring the distance between aggregated virus particles a t different points on the curve.

For example, macromolecules smaller than viruses may be difficult to distinguish from the antibodies themselves, while large structures such as bacteria tend to obscure the antibodies and yield poor resolution. Second, since the electron microscope is a transmission instrument it will always be necessary to select for examination those aggregates which are arranged more or less two dimensionally, as resolution decreases rapidly with increase in specimen thickness. Also, even though negative staining does not expose the specimen to the same severe effects as shadow-casting, distortion must occur during the drying down process, and it must be considered that small aggregates that appear two dimensional in the microscope may not have started that way.",

With this system the antigen DNP is too small to be visualized by the negative staining procedure, so that it is possible to visualize combined antibody without antigen appearing in the micrograph. In order to understand their results it will first be necessary to consider briefly the proposed chemical structure of the IgG molecule. This has been reviewed by Fleischman (1966) and the molecule is described as a dimer (Fig. 16) , each half of which contains an H (heavy) chain (molecular weight 50,000) and an L (light) chain (molecular weight 20,000). When digested with papain the molecule splits into three parts, two of which are identical and retain an antigen-binding site. These form the so-called \"Fab\" fragment which can be looked on as (Fleischman, 1966.) monovalent antibody. The third fraction has no combining activity, is of low molecular weight, comes from the central region of the complete molecule, and is referred to as the Fc fragment because under certain conditions it can be made to crystallize.",

However, the Y-shaped molecule would seem to be somewhat of a paradox in at least one respect, for if the two combining sites are situated as suggested in Fig. 17 , then it is surprising that so few antibody molecules combine with two antigenic sites located on the same virus particle. Undeniable looping of antibody molecules, where the antibody had combined with two sites on the same virus particle, was found only rarely in our studies whereas linking between two different particles was the general occurrence (Figs. 10, 14,  15 ). It has been suggested in this context that antigenic structures such as viruses would exert a distorting effect on the antibody molecules, pulling them out so as to give a linear appearance which is artifact. The likelihood of distortion is very real, but one must still answer why the antibody molecule should have attached to sites on each of two different virus particles in the first place, as this would not occur unless the binding sites were located at some distance from each other an the antibody molecule. As we shall see a similar problem arises in the in- Valentine and Green (1967) with the DNP and IgG antibody system. terpretation of the morphology of IgM antibody, and here again it appears that the nature of the antigen used can influence the appearance of the antibody structure obtained. It must also be observed that in studies on antibody structures we are using the electron microscope near the limit of practical resolution for biological material, even though the actual resolution is considerably better. This in turn means that it is dangerous to put too definite an interpretation on some of the structures visualized until a more solid basis of information has been obtained from a wider range of antigen-antibody systems.",

IgM was first visualized by Humphrey and Dourmashkin (1965) using sheep red cell membrane as the antigen. Red cell membrane fragments roll up into strips of suitable dimensions for negative staining, making it possible to resolve any structures attached to their edges. The IgM molecules appeared as distinctive \"staple\"-shaped structures with a clearly angular outline. This \"staple\" form was confirmed in 1966 by Feinstein and Munn using bacterial flagella as the antigen. I n 1967 Almeida et al. reported a study of IgM using foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) as the antigen (Fig. 18) . They also confirmed the staple configuration ( Fig. 19) but also found that where the antibody linked antigenic sites on different virus particles rather than sites on the same particle the molecule could appear linear (Fig. 20) with lengths of up to 370 and average dimensions of 350 x 50 A. One of the most striking differences between IgG and IgM antibody molecules is the apparently greater flexibility of the latter, which may simply be a function of the greater length of this molecule. Looping, which was encountered rarely for IgG antibody, was present in all the micrographs obtained with IgM, and the staple form, which has been most frequently seen, is in fact a form of looping.",

The FMDV preparation, on the other hand, was used a t such a concentration that antigenic sites would be just as available on separate particles as on the same one. I n addition, the particle of this virus, whose overall diameter is only 240 A, can have only a very limited number of antigenic sites available for attachment, whereas red cell fragments and bacterial flagella are not only large but are also linear, two features which would facilitate attachment to the fig. 15 .

Morphologically the virus is pleomorphic, with distinctive projections (Fig. 221 , and is now included in the group known as coronaviruses . Complexes were formed of virus and two types of antiserum: (1) homotypic, that is, derived from chicken, and (2) heterotypic, produced in rabbits (Berry and ). Both of these sera produced clumping (Figs. 23, 25) but a t high magnifications obvious differences could be seen between the two types of aggregate. I n the case of the homotypic antiserum antibody was attached only to the virus projections and, where these projections were missing, it was clear that no antibody was attached to the envelope of the virus (Figs. 23, 24) . The spacing between virus particles was wide and there seemed to be a gap between the antibody-projection complex and the rest of the particle. With the heterotypic antiserum the particles were clumped much more closely together and antibody molecules were attached not only to the projections but also to the envelope of the virus (Fig. 25) . A possible explanation of this phenomenon was that the envelope of the virus did not elicit a response in the chicken. The projections, on the other hand, were recognized as foreign and antibody was directed against them. This hypothesis was investigated by reacting the virus with rabbit antiserum produced against normal chick embryo fibroblasts. It was then found that antichick antibody molecules were attached to the envelope of the virus and that virus was neutralized by it. The outstanding feature of the micrographs obtained with this serum is the presence of holes in the virus surface (Fig. 26) , a phenomenon that will be discussed in the section on immune lysis.",

This meant that it was possible to localize visually two different species of surface antigen, one of which appears t o be antigenically indistinguishable from host cell membrane, the other being virus-specific. Similar studies on viruses such as influenza or the parainfluenea group would probably need virus preparations from which the surface projections could be artificially removed.

Magnification X 300,000. more complex it still seems possible for a wide range of viruses to be reviewed in this way and specific antigens located. Another problem in this kind of study is that while it might seem possible to use specific antiserum dirccted against particular virus components, e.g., the neuraminidase of influenza virus, the requirements of the electron microscope as regards specificity are probably greater than for most other techniques, so that even a small amount of nonspecific antibody will obscure the picture. Again, however, better preparations of antibody are becoming available, and it should soon be possible to utilize the microscope for the double purpose of pinpointing antigens and, when this has been done, for checking the specificity of any particular batch of antiserum.",

It had been known for some time that fresh unheated antiserum to infectious bronchitis virus had a neutralizing titer a thousand-fold greater than serum which had been inactivated. This finding held for both homotypic and heterotypic antiserum. In order to investigate this phenomenon, the virus was examined after treatment with each of four groups of antiserum; these were, homotypic fresh, homotypic heat-inactivated, heterotypic fresh, and heterotypic heat-inactivated. As the homotypic serum reacts only with the projections of the virus, changes in the basic envelope could not be expected, as it is known that the enzymic action of complement on lipoprotein can occur only when antibody is attached at or very close to the membrane containing the lipoprotein. Indeed, the only visible difference between the effects of fresh and heated homotypic antiserum was that complement components could be visualized when the unheated serum was used, a finding which will be discussed in the next section. However, the difference in effect between the fresh and heated heterotypic serum was an outstanding one. Those particles treated with heated serum had displayed only the appearance associated with virus-antibody aggregates, i.e., the particles were clumped and the surface detail was obscured by the presence of antibody (Fig. 25) . On the other hand, virus complexed with fresh heterotypic antiserum appeared gray, which is indicative of flattening, and displayed pits or craters (Fig. 27) indistinguishable from those present in red cell membranes showing lysis.",

When guinea pig serum was added to this antigen-antibody preparation the appearance changed, as a new complex became visible, attached a t first in patches associated with the antibody but eventually merging to cover the complete flagellum. This was bound complement which appeared as a fine fuzzy halo surrounding the antigen-antibody complex. I n the avian infectious bronchitis system results similar to this were obtained with both homotypic and heterotypic antisera. With antibody alone the halo of projections plus antibody did not exceed 300 k, whereas after treatment with unheated serum the halo could extend as far as 700 ( Fig. 29) . However, it should be pointed out that not all particles exhibited this additional covering of fine filamentous molecules.

One cannot imagine a virus being able to survive as an infective agent after the rupture of the outer membrane. However, fresh homotypic serum has an equally enhanced neutralizing ability (Berry and Almeida, 196S), but no lytic affect can be demonstrated. A possible explanation is that the additional complement coating could act by steric hindrance thus enhancing the effect of a low titer FIas. 27-29. antiserum which by itself could only partially cover a virus with antibody.

The technique has been employed by groups too numerous to mention and the bibliography on the field is now enormous. The extension of the method for immune electron microscopy has been known for 8 years but during this time only a small number of people have attempted to use it. This would seem to be because of two main reasons, first unawareness of the potential of the technique, and second the feeling that the method is an extremely difficult one to handle. By discussing under separate headings the various different aspects that can be studied using immune electron microscopy we hope that we have been able to illustrate its many uses. As for the second point we can only repeat what was stated earlier-that the method is a straightforward one giving direct, visual evidence of the immune reaction to be studied. I n the text we have described that the immune aggregate should be incubated for 1 hour a t 37\u00b0C and then left in the cold overnight. This is the optimum approach for a system where the concentration of neither the antigen nor the antiserum is known and maximum clumping is needed. However, with many systems these parameters have been established, and if it is known that clumping can be obtained readily, for example as with the avian infectious bronchitis system, then incubation for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C is sufficient, followed by spinning at 10,000 rpm for half an hour. This means that the whole preparatory procedure can be carried out in less FIG. 27. When nonheat-inactivated heterotypic antiserum is combined with IB virus then the three component antigen-antibody-complement system leads not only to attachment of antibody but also to the appearance of lytic holes in the virus envelope. These holes are approximately 100 A in diameter and resemble those that occur in red cell membranes during hemolysis. Magnification X 300,000.",

With antibody alone the halo surrounding the virus is approximately than 2 hours, a time comparing favorably with most other immunological techniques. Also in favor of the technique is the fact that it can be carried out with very small quantities of material. With some problems the absolute amount of virus available for any one experiment has been in the region of lo8 particles, an amount that would be too small to give a result with the agar gel immunodiffusion techniques or indeed with most standard immunological techniques. The limitations of the method are mostly concerned with the type of structure on which the antigenic sites are located, size being all important. Viruses in the small to intermediate size range are ideal for immune studies, as the particles are not disproportionately larger than the antibody molecules attached to them, and interaction between them can be visualized with better than 10 a resolution. Particles as large as the poxviruses are becoming too large for good resolution of antibody molecules to be obtained, and aggregates of poxvirus particles are usually too dense to be recorded photographically except at low power. If, on the other hand, the method is needed only to establish whether or not aggregation has occurred then structures considerably larger than the pox group, e.g., mycoplasmas, can be employed.",

I n the field of clinical virology there is a possibility that the electron microscope technique of negative staining will become a standard method of diagnosis (Williams et al., 1962) . Already the method has proved its value for rapid diagnosis in smallpox outbreaks (Peters et al., 1962; Cruickshank et al., 1966) . It is not hard to imagine that an extension of this approach, employing immune electron microscopy, will allow particles not only to be visualized but also to be serotyped. I n a few instances this could be done directly from the patient when, for example, vesicular lesions containing relatively large amounts of virus are present. If a herpes-type virus were found it would be possible by the use of typing sera to establish whether it is herpes simplex or herpes zoster. This finding a t the moment may be of academic importance only, but a time should come when specific therapy is available, and it would then be of the utmost importance to serotype such viruses in as short' a time as possible. Also in the routine field immune electron microscopy could be both the simplest and the most accurate method for checking the specificity of an antiserum and even of titrating it, once further base lines have been established.",
