Regardless of the causative agent, symptoms of respiratory infections due to viruses are not only similar between different viruses but also overlap with those of bacterial respiratory infections, which makes etiologic diagnosis even more challenging. Because the majority of respiratory infections in children have a viral origin, empirical antibiotic treatment only on the basis of clinical suspicion is imprecise. It may also have been 1 of the causes of the global emergence of resistant pathogens (Jacobs, 2003). Early and accurate detection of the viral or bacterial agent can orientate timely and specific treatment as well as reduce antibiotic misuse and spread of hospital-acquired respiratory infections. Benefits would not only derive from improved clinical outcomes but also from a more effective utilization of healthcare resources (Barenfanger et al., 2000, Bonner et al., 2003, Doan et al., 2012).",

Rapid antigen detection tests have been described as simple specific methods that are especially suitable for viral detection at the point of care (Takahashi et al., 2010). Nonetheless, these tests have modest and highly variable sensitivities and are only available for a limited number of common viral targets. In contrast, PCR has become the reference method for diagnosing viral respiratory infections due to its high sensitivity and high specificity (Mahoney, 2010). Multi-testing capabilities of a wide range of viruses and high throughput are other advantageous features of PCR. However, techniques based on PCR still require stringent conditions of fixed and bulky equipment, expert technicians, and dedicated separate laboratory rooms to prevent crossed contaminations. As a consequence, performance of PCR typically remains centralized in reference laboratories, which, in most cases, may not be easily accessible for prompt diagnosis.",

            "text": "Results of this study suggest that the mariPOC Assay was highly specific for the viruses covered by the test but showed variable sensitivities that ranged from moderately high for RSV to worryingly low for ADV. Thus, confirmation of negative results by means of more sensitive methods such as PCR would be a recommendable practice when using the mariPOC Assay in a clinical laboratory environment. High specificities found concurred with those reported in a previous evaluation of the assay versus PCR in a pediatric emergency department setting (Ivaska et al., 2013). However, we observed comparably higher sensitivity for hMPV and lower sensitivities for RSV, IFV-A, IFV-B, and ADV in our study. We hypothesize that differences in sensitivities between the 2 evaluations could derive from differences in factors that have an impact on positivity such as virus microbiological characteristics, course of infection, children age, and reference PCR techniques used (Ohmit and Monto, 2006). It is to be noted that sensitivity found for RSV was similar to sensitivities of 72.0\u201379.8% documented for rapid RSV tests versus PCR in other studies in children (Aslanzadeh et al., 2008, Miernyk et al., 2011, Munjal et al., 2011). Similarly, sensitivities of the assay for IFV were not discordant with the variable values in a range of 45.0\u201383.0% of rapid IFV tests in children described elsewhere (Alexander et al., 2005, Cruz et al., 2010, Grijalva et al., 2007, Sandora et al., 2010). In contrast, a recent study comparing the mariPOC test against the direct antibody assay (Tuuminen et al., 2013) reported higher sensitivities both for RSV (100%) and IFV-A (85.7%). The fact that this study was performed during the seasonal winter epidemics, when severity of infections is more likely to increase positive results, may explain the improved values of sensitivity described in the study for both pathogens. Sensitivities for hMPV were considerably lower than values in a range of 70.6\u201382.3% previously reported for other rapid hMPV tests compared to PCR (Kikuta et al., 2008, Matsuzaki et al., 2009). Likewise, sensitivity for ADV was under the value of 55% documented for an ADV immunochromatographic test (Levent et al., 2009). Interestingly, despite low sensitivity for detection of PIV, coverage of this virus could be a distinctive feature of the mariPOC Assay since, to our knowledge, no other rapid antigen test targeting PIV has reached the market so far. In turn, uncovered detections of CoV, EV, RV, BoV, and PIV-4 could be considered drawbacks of the assay in comparison with multiplex PCR techniques, which usually offer coverage of a wider range of respiratory agents. The mariPOC Assay proved to be robust as few samples inhibited compared to the number of inhibitions by the PCR techniques. Since there were not significant differences in sensitivities and specificities delivered by the assay for the subset of samples that had been frozen for storage until testing versus the subset of fresh samples analyzed prospectively, preprocessing activities do not seem to have influenced results.",

During the pandemic influenza season, specific PCR techniques targeting IFV were performed instead of non-specific multiplex PCR to confirm presence of suspected influenza. This cost-effective practice followed in our clinical laboratory would explain that few IFV samples were identified as positive during the study. In the case of ADV and PIV, the low rates of positives found in relation to these viruses may reflect their less important role in the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections in our geographical area and are in line with positive rates reported for these viruses in other local studies (Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2012, Pi\u00f1ero Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012). It is also important to note that the quantity and ability to detect viruses by antigen or PCR assays vary with age. Since this study was conducted from the laboratory approach, no demographic data of patients were registered. This fact does not affect comparison of results by the 2 techniques in the same sample, but it could be a potential limitation for comparing our results with those from other studies.",
