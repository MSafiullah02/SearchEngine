Screening echocardiography showed right atrial and right ventricular dilatation with estimated pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure of 70 mmHg. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography diagnosed massive pulmonary embolism. He was thrombolyzed with injection reteplase. On venous Doppler, deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed. In view of worsening respiratory distress, he was put on mechanical ventilation and veno-venous ECMO. The right internal jugular vein and right femoral vein were cannulated by an ultrasound-guided percutaneous technique. He was decannulated after 6 days. During his 2-month stay in the hospital, he underwent hemodialysis for acute renal failure, had multiple antibiotics for sepsis and steroids in the form of dexamethasone 8 mg thrice daily for 5 days, and had tracheostomy. Twenty days after ECMO was terminated, he was weaned off ventilator and tracheostomy. Patient conditions improved and he was discharged with sterile blood cultures. Before discharged, his echo showed normal PA pressures and normal aortic valve morphology. He was ambulatory while discharged and needed support while walking. On discharge, he was advised to continue tablet dabigatran 150 mg twice daily for long term.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed acute lacunar infarcts in bilateral fronto-parietal lobes. The patient did not have any fever spikes and blood culture came sterile. The left eye was diagnosed to have endophthalmitis and the patient received topical antibiotics and topical steroids. Screening transthoracic echo done on the 3rd day showed vegetation on the aortic valve with paravalvular abscess. He had mild eccentric aortic regurgitation with normal PA pressures and normal left ventricular systolic function. He was started electively on broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the patient next day developed complete heart block and increase in abscess size on echo. He was taken up for emergency surgery and diseased aortic valve was replaced with sutureless bioprosthetic valve. Operative findings showed tricuspid aortic valve with vegetations at the right and non-coronary cusp junction and abscess at the aortic annulus extending into the interventricular septum. Extensive debridement of abscess was done and sent for culture. The raw area was covered with pericardial patch. The patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass with dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline support. He was extubated after 72 h.",

In the interim period, the patient was maintaining own heart rate of about 65\u201370/min in complete heart block. He was put on backup mode with epicardial pacing leads. Serial blood cultures were sent and after ensuring negative culture, the patient underwent permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) on 12th postoperative day. After PPI, echo showed normally functioning aortic valve prosthesis with paravalvular leak. Grade 1 + mitral regurgitation was noted with fair left ventricular function and ejection fraction of 50%. Gradient across the prosthetic valve was 18/11 mmHg and PA pressure was 20 mmHg. After 1 month of hospital stay, the patient was discharged with sterile blood cultures and normally functioning prosthetic valve. He was told to continue oral voriconazole for 6 months and to review then. He was started on tablet warfarin to maintain International normalized ratio (INR) of about 2\u20132.5 and plan to switch to oral dabigatran after 3 months. The patient continues to come for regular follow-ups and is doing well.",
