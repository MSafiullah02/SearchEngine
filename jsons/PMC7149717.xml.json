In part, the predominant research focus on immune-mediated neurotoxicity is a consequence of the following common (but incorrect) presumptions:\u25aaThe nervous system played little to no role in regulating immune responses and was thus passive and always on the receiving end of neuroimmune interactions.\u25aaImmune functions were primarily aimed toward pathogen defense and were thus always cytotoxic.\u25aaNeuronal function was incompatible with exposure to activated immune cells and their pro-inflammatory products.\u25aaTherefore, to maintain CNS function of post-mitotic neurons, it was essential that the CNS be isolated from the immune system by the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and thus protected from cytotoxic substances produced by activated immune cells.\n",

Specifically, we will detail multiple mechanisms by which the nervous system regulates and directs immune function toward what is needed and tolerated by the nervous system. Identification of multiple regulatory points also suggests multiple sites that can be disrupted by pathogens, toxins or genetic abnormalities to trigger, facilitate and/or exacerbate the onset and progression of classic neurodegenerative disorders. Surprisingly, targeted disruptions in T-cell and macrophage functions have revealed previously unknown essential roles of the immune system in maintaining cognitive function even in the absence of overt infection and injury (Schwartz and Kipnis, 2011, Dilger and Johnson, 2008, Derecki et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2010). For example, CD4+T-cell deficiency in murine models leads to decreased performance in tests of murine learning and memory (Derecki et al., 2010). In addition, targeted disruption of Hoxb8 in macrophage lineages is sufficient to trigger onset of obsessive-compulsive\u2013like behaviors in otherwise healthy mice free of pathogenic infection or injury (Chen et al., 2010). Supplementation of Hoxb8-deficient mice with wild-type bone marrow was sufficient to restore normal behavior (Chen et al., 2010).",

T-cell\u2013dependent control of the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondi (T. gondii) illustrates that the sustained chronic influx of activated, IFN\u03b3-producing lymphocytes into the CNS can be well tolerated without causing overt neurodegeneration (Ferguson, 2009, Wilson et al., 2010). T. gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan able to infect all mammals. Humans generally become infected due to ingestion of undercooked infected meat or exposure to T. gondii sporozoites in soil. Once an individual is infected by T. gondii, the parasite invades all tissues in the body. An individual\u2019s immune system is able to rapidly clear the fast-replicating tachyzoites from most tissues, but cannot clear all forms of the parasite from the body. Instead, T. gondii evades elimination by the immune system from sites of tissue infection by entering the latent bradyzoite tissue cyst stage of its life cycle. Lifelong influx of interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3)\u2013producing T-cells into tissues is required to prevent emergence of the cytotoxic tachyzoites from latent tissue cysts.",

In adult humans with competent immune systems, infection by this common pathogen is usually benign. By contrast, in humans with severe immunodeficiency (such as that caused by HIV or chemotherapy), the failure of sufficient numbers of IFN\u03b3-producing T-cells to infiltrate the CNS is accompanied by emergence of cytotoxic tachyzoites from tissue cysts and widespread necrotizing damage to the CNS. Left untreated, this condition can be fatal (Ferguson, 2009, Wilson et al., 2010). Despite the presence of IFN\u03b3-producing T-cells and activated macrophages in their brains, immune-competent individuals infected with T. gondii do not display overt clinical or histologic signs of neuropathology such as those associated with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Parkinson\u2019s disease despite chronic CNS inflammation (Carson et al., 2006, Dilger and Johnson, 2008, Ferguson, 2009, Wilson et al., 2010). It is possible that subtle changes in brain function result from this type of chronic inflammation. However, the behavior of the population as a whole in regions with high prevalence of T. gondii infections clearly indicates that high levels of cognitive and motor brain function can be maintained in the presence of at least one common form of lifelong brain inflammation.",

However, this does not minimize the potential neurologic damage and clinical dysfunction caused by aberrant or dysregulated neuroimmune interactions. In particular, CNS function is dependent on large populations of post-mitotic neurons and experience-driven formation of synaptic pathways. Therefore, it is vulnerable to functional disruption caused by pathogen-mediated damage in the absence of sufficient immune responses, as well as by immune-mediated damage in the presence of overly robust immune responses. However, as in the case of suspected immune-mediated triggers of autism, it is not always clear if the neuronal dysfunction is caused by too few, too many or just the wrong types of neuroimmune interactions (Dilger and Johnson, 2008, Brynskikh et al., 2008).",

When cells are infected by an intracellular pathogen, the cell\u2019s protein synthetic machinery produces both self- and pathogen peptides. As a result, self-antigens and pathogen antigens will be loaded into the pocket of the MHC class I molecule as it travels to the plasma membrane. Once activated by antigen presentation, the functional response of CD8 T-cells is to kill the infected and/or severely damaged MHC class I\u2013expressing cell (Lo et al., 1999, Carson et al., 2006, Siffrin et al., 2007). Consequently, activated CD8+T-cells are also referred to as cytolytic lymphocytes (CTLs). Nearly all cells including CNS neurons can be induced to produce MHC class I. However, it should be noted that neurons are not as readily induced to express MHC class I as other cells in the CNS, such as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. It is speculated that the much higher resistance of neurons to expression of MHC class I is an adaptive measure to prevent CD8+ T-cell triggered lysis of infected but still functional CNS neurons (Carson et al., 2006, Dilger and Johnson, 2008, Siffrin et al., 2007).",

However, these non-classical MHC molecules are not recognized to have antigen presentation functions. Astrocytes in glial cultures do express functional MHC class II. Because astrocytic expression of MHC class II within the intact CNS is not detected in healthy or disease conditions, this in vitro expression appears to be an aberrant consequence of culture.

Based on their production of factors that determine and support specific activation states in innate immune cells and B-cells, antigen-activated T-cells CD4+T-cells are referred to as T helper (Th) cells. CD4+T-cells phenotypes range from pro-inflammatory (Th1, Th17), humoral (Th2, Th9, ThFH), and anti-inflammatory (Th3, T regulatory [Treg]) to even anergized (permanently inactivated) phenotypes (Figure 33-1). IFN\u03b3-producing Th1 CD4+T-cells promote myeloid cells to develop classical activation state (also termed M1) characterized by enhanced microbicidal and tumoricidal abilities, high expression levels of INOS, CD40, MHC class I, MHC class II and robust secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, IL-23 and TNF-\u03b1) (Colton and Wilcock, 2010, Gordon and Martinez, 2010, Graeber and Streit, 2010, Yang et al., 2010). Conversely, Il-4\u2013 and IL-13\u2013producing Th2 CD4+T-cells are not only essential for B-cell activation, Th2 cells also promote alternative activation states (also termed M2a and 2b) in myeloid cells. Alternative activation states are characterized by expression of macrophage mannose receptor (also referred to as CD206), YM1, stabilin-1 and arginase I. Alternatively activated cells are functionally associated with enhanced phagocytosis, tissue repair and parasite elimination. Finally, Il-10-, TGF\u03b2-producing Th3 cells and Treg cells promote regulatory activation states (also termed M2c) in myeloid cells. These states are characterized by production of molecules associated with tissue repair and immunosuppression (Colton and Wilcock, 2010, Gordon and Martinez, 2010, Graeber and Streit, 2010, Yang et al., 2010).",

Thus, classically activated macrophages and dendritic cells preferentially promote Th1 and Th17 differentiation of CD4+T-cells, while alternatively activated myeloid cells preferentially promote differentiation of T-cells with humoral and anti-inflammatory phenotypes. To summarize, the interactive cross-regulation between the innate and adaptive immune systems can appear circular, resulting in either beneficial or detrimental outcomes for the host. This cross-regulatory aspect of innate and adaptive immunity can lead to increased refinement of the immune response such that the pathogens (and thus all antigenic and alarm stimuli) are eliminated and immune resolution and tissue repair programs are effectively launched. Alternatively, chronic inflammation results if the pathogen or pathogen associated antigenic stimuli (such as unclearable pathogenic toxins or cross-reactive self-antigens) cannot be eliminated. Chronic inflammation can be highly detrimental to tissue function due to immune-mediated cytotoxicity and dysregulated fibrotic repair.",

In the uninfected healthy individual, these immature dendritic cells and tissue macrophages routinely contribute to tissue homeostasis by the phagocytosis of cell debris. In doing so, these tissue APCs capture self-antigens and load them into their MHC class II molecules. Once activated by phagocytosis, these antigen-presenting cells migrate to the lymph nodes draining each tissue. In the lymph node, these short-lived APCs move among the large number of T-cells within the lymph node, testing if any have TCRs able to recognize their captured self-antigen. Soluble tissue antigens also reach lymph nodes by passive drainage along the lymphatic system associated with most tissues. MHC-expressing dendritic cells take up these antigens and present them to T-cells within the lymph node. If these antigen-presenting cells do not encounter other activating stimuli such as PAMPs or pro-inflammatory cytokines, they will express MHC but no other co-stimulatory factors. Consequently, they will only provide what is referred to as \u201csignal 1\u201d to a T-cell, with the result that the T-cell is permanently inactivated. To restate, mature na\u00efve T-cells activated by their TCR and no other co-stimulatory signals will become permanently inactivated (referred to as anergized). This ongoing process of presenting self-antigens in the absence of alarm signals, resulting in the inactivation of autoreactive T-cells, is termed peripheral tolerance.",

When occurring during the process of MHC-mediated antigen-presentation, co-stimulatory factors provide signals 2 and 3 of T-cell activation.

Antigen-induced T-cell functions can range from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory depending on the types and concentrations of the molecules providing signals 2 and 3 (see \u201cAntigen-activated T-cells regulate the activation of innate immune cells\u201d in this chapter).

Norepinephrine (NE) is the primary neurotransmitter released from sympathetic neurons. Most lymphocytes express a wide variety of neurotransmitter receptors. However, the level of expression differs as a function of activation state and cell type. For example, the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (receptor for NE) is expressed at much higher levels in Th1 than in Th2 CD4+T-cells. Thus, \u03b22 adrenergic agonists preferentially induce cAMP elevations in Th1 CD4+T-cells over Th2 CD4+T-cells and play a larger role in regulating Th1 function. The extent to which the nervous system can direct and shape adaptive immune responses is illustrated by studies quantifying the effects of denervating the lymphoid organs by mechanical or chemical methods. For example, in animal models with normal innervation, Th1 CD4+T-cells promote B-cell production of IgG1 antibody isotypes, while Th2 CD4+T-cells promote B-cell production of IgG2a antibody isotypes. Denervation of the spleen leads to increased ratios of IgG2a to IgG1, indicative of an increase in Th2 CD4+T-cell responses and consistent with the in vitro observations of NE-mediated regulation of Th1 function. In vitro studies have also shown that direct stimulation of the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor on B-cells increases the propensity to produce immunoglobulin (Ig) E, which is associated with allergic (type 1 hypersensitivity) and anti-parasitic immune responses (Nance and Sanders, 2007, Gonzalez\u2013Rey et al., 2010). Consistent with these observations, in animal models contusion models of spinal cord injury (SCI) have illustrated that altering neuronal activity to lymphoid organs alters B-cell production of antibodies (Held et al., 2010, Lucin et al., 2007).",

High-level SCI (at thoracic level 3) caused sustained increases in splenic NE along with impaired antibody synthesis and elevated splenocyte apoptosis that could be reversed by using \u03b22 adrenergic receptor blockers (Lucin et al., 2007). Furthermore, impaired antibody production could be mimicked with low level SCI (thoracic level 9) with a beta2AR agonist. The effects of denervation are not limited to B-cells. In vitro and in vivo data reveal that NE inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory molecules such as TNF by lymphoid macrophages and dendritic cells. Innervation even affects the generation of mature lymphocytes. Seizure-associated changes in the sympathetic innervation of the thymus decrease the proliferative capacity of the lymphocytes being produced as well as changing the ratios of CD4+to CD8+T-cells that successfully mature (Nance and Sanders, 2007, Gonzalez\u2013Rey et al., 2010, Held et al., 2010, Lucin et al., 2007, Carson and Lo, 2007).

Dendritic cells are considered to be the professional APCs of the immune system and critical for the initial activation and polarization of T-cell responses (see above). As a function of maturation, dendritic cells progress from being highly phagocytic cells with lower expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules to being relatively nonphagocytic cells with very high expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules (Lo et al., 1999). It is highly notable that coincident with their maturation into potent APCs, dendritic cells transition from expressing primarily serotonin 5-HT1B-, 5-HT1E- and 5-HT2B- receptors in their immature state to expressing primarily 5-HT4- and 5-HT7-receptors in their mature state (Gonzalez\u2013Rey et al., 2010, Carson and Lo, 2007). Pharmacological studies demonstrate that the expressed receptors are functional and that they regulate stage-specific functions in dendritic cells. For example, 5-HT4\u2013and 5-HT7\u2013specific ligands suppress dendritic cell secretion of IL-12 and TNF\u2014cytokines that play critical roles in promoting differentiation of Th1 CD4+T-cells.",

In vitro antigen presentation by dendritic cells exposed to \u03b1-melanocyte\u2013stimulating hormone (MSH), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), or pituitary adenylate cyclase\u2013activating peptide (PACAP) led to antigen-driven production of Treg CD4+T-cells (Gonzalez\u2013Rey et al., 2010).

The capillary network is so dense that it is estimated that all neurons and glia are within 20 microns of a capillary. Unlike other organs, the CNS is protected and sheltered from routine exposure of blood-derived products by the BBB and blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. In most other tissues, fenestrated or sinusoidal porous capillaries allow variable levels of small molecules to passively move from the blood into the tissue. In addition, some molecules are actively transported into tissues by intracellular transcytosis mechanisms. By contrast, the BBB of the CNS is an organized neurovascular unit composed of astrocytes, pericytes and specialized endothelial cells lacking fenestrated structures. Tight junctions between endothelial cells of the BBB prevent paracellular transport into the CNS of blood-derived molecules. Instead, blood-derived factors must be actively transported across the endothelial barrier by transcellular mechanisms. The abluminal (CNS parenchyma) side of these endothelial cells is surrounded by basement membranes and further encased by astrocytic end-feet. Pericytes are located in the perivascular space between the endothelial cells and astrocytic end-feet. The immune function of pericytes is the subject of substantial debate. However, recent data indicate they contribute to the neurogenic potential of the neurovascular unit. It is important to note that several brain regions, referred to as the circumventricular organs (CVOs), do not have complete BBBs. Therefore CVOs provide ports of entry for passive transfer of large molecules or specific cell types into the CNS (see also in Ch. 3).",

Activated immune cells also express a variety of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that facilitate migration across the BBB. Most na\u00efve T-cells also do not express sufficiently high levels of adhesion molecules to bind the luminal (blood side) face of CNS endothelial cells and extravasate into the CNS. Consequently, entry into the CNS is largely restricted to antigen- or chemokine-activated lymphocytes with high expression of adhesion molecules such as VLA-4 and LFA-1 that bind the VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expressed by activated endothelial cells. The dependence on these molecules is demonstrated by the effectiveness of an anti-VLA-4 therapeutic antibody (natalizumab) in the treatment of the CNS autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis (Clifford et al., 2010). Individuals treated with natalizumab had large reductions in the numbers of T-cells trafficking into their CNS, large reductions in T-cell myelin damage and large reductions in clinical neurologic signs of CNS damage. However, the reduced T-cell trafficking came with a severe side effect associated with reduced tissue surveillance. By blocking the adhesion molecule required for efficient extravasation and subsequent infiltration into tissues, natalizumab increased the risk of JC virus, a normally benign virus, developing into a lethal brain pathogen (Clifford et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 2 (CCL2) (previously referred to as monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1) is the primary chemokine required for monocyte and macrophage entry into the CNS (Ge et al., 2009, Puntambekar et al., 2011). Genetic deletion of either CCL2 or CCR2, the receptor for CCL2, dramatically reduces the numbers of macrophages infiltrating the CNS in response to systemic immune activation or the presence of infection or other pro-inflammatory stimuli in the CNS. Different routes of entry into the CNS by different leukocyte populations may be regulated by different chemokines. Recently, the secretion of the chemokine CCL20 by the choroid plexus epithelium was demonstrated to be required for the entry of CCR6-expressing CD4+Th17 cell and the subsequent initiation of CNS autoimmunity (Kim et al., 2010, Reboldi et al., 2009). However a single chemokine may also serve to co-localize two interacting immune cell populations. CXCR3 is the receptor for C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10). Several studies suggest that the secretion of CXCL10 by astrocytes at the blood\u2013brain barrier acts to limit pathology during autoimmune inflammation by recruiting and retaining CXCR3+T-cells to the perivascular space. Both T-regulatory cells and effector T-cells express CXCR3. Therefore, astrocytic secretion of CXCL10 within the perivascular space promotes interaction of the anti-inflammatory CD4+Treg population with the proinflammatory effector T-cell population that it is designed to inhibit.",

For example, in a model of CNS corona virus infection, T-cells could no longer infiltrate the parenchyma in CCL2-deficient mice (Savarin et al., 2010). In the absence of CCL2-triggered influx of monocytes into the infected CNS, T-cells could not cross the glial limitans and accumulated at perivascular sites. Neither is monocyte and macrophage influx into the CNS by itself sufficient to support extravasated T-cell migration into the CNS parenchyma, even in the presence of strong pathogenic stimuli (Noor et al., 2010, Ploix et al., 2010). Instead, CNS-derived cues may be necessary. For example, neurons and glia express the T-cell chemokine CCL21 in response to infection and injury (Siffrin et al., 2007, Noor et al., 2010, Ploix et al., 2010, Biber et al., 2007). Following T. gondii infection, T-cells expressing CCR7 (the receptor for CCL21) migrate into the CNS along infection-induced reticular networks of CCL21. In mice deficient in CCL21, macrophages readily infiltrated the T. gondii\u2013infected CNS parenchyma. However, the CCR7 expressing CD4+T-cells did not. They preferentially accumulated in perivascular spaces.",

However, CNS expressed CCL21 was by itself insufficient to support CD4+T-cell extravasation into either the perivascular or parenchymal spaces in the CNS of uninfected mice. Furthermore, CCL21 expression leads to the spontaneous organization of inflammatory infiltrates into lymphoid-like structures in non-immune\u2013privileged organs in response to infection or autoimmune triggers. Even in the presence of robust pro-inflammatory stimuli, CCL21 does not promote organization of infiltrating lymphocytes into lymphoid-like structures. Considered together, these studies reveal the existence of multiple levels of CNS-intrinsic regulation controlling the influx and organization of distinct populations of immune cells within the CNS.",

First, rodents and humans can be treated with whole-body irradiation that is just sufficient to destroy the bone marrow and its contained stem cells that routinely replace short-lived hematopoietic cells within tissues and in circulation. Unless irradiated mammals receive donor bone marrow, they will die, because they will no longer be able to generate red or white blood cells. With one prominent exception, the tissue macrophages and all hematopoetic cells found in the irradiated hosts are replaced by cells derived from donor stem cells within a few months. The only tissue macrophages that remain host derived are the parenchymal microglia that are not destroyed within the CNS. It is important to note that the perivascular myeloid cells are donor derived (Hickey & Freeman, 1988). Irradiation alters the vasculature and can facilitate inappropriate influx of myeloid cells into the CNS. However, these histologic observations have been confirmed using two additional methodologies: parabiotic linkage of the vasculature of two congenic strains of mice as well as a complex series of transgenic lineage studies. This latter study also demonstrated that microglia found in the adult CNS derive from primitive myeloid progenitors that arise before embryonic day 8 and are not bone marrow derived progenitors.",

Most tissue macrophages are short lived and continually replaced by bone marrow\u2013derived stem cells. By contrast, microglia are long-lived and largely self-renewing. Lineage studies further indicate that microglia arise from a primitive yolk sac hematopoietic myeloid precursor and co-differentiate as the neuroectoderm forms the CNS. Although CNS-resident microglia cannot be reliably distinguished from infiltrating macrophages by histologic methods, microglia can be identified using flow cytometric analysis of brain cell suspensions. While all other nucleated hematopoietic populations express uniformly high levels of CD45 in the mature individual, CNS-resident microglia are unique in their uniform log order lower level of CD45 expression. Recently, gene profiling studies have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells TREM-2 is preferentially expressed on CD45low microglia, while the pro-inflammatory TREM-1 is preferentially expressed on acutely infiltrating CD45hi macrophages (Schmid et al., 2009).",

Grafting dye-labeled microglia and macrophages into the parenchyma of the murine CNS clearly revealed that transferred CNS-resident microglia can migrate great distances within the CNS. However, microglia could not be detected to migrate to the draining cervical lymph nodes. Indeed, up to two weeks post-transfer, nearly all of the transferred CD45low microglia are retained in the healthy murine CNS. By contrast, CD45high macrophages transferred into healthy murine CNS can be detected within the draining cervical lymph nodes within 24 hours of transfer, with few retained in the CNS. Consistent with these studies, 2-photon microscopy studies of microglia motility in response to CNS injury demonstrated rapid motility of microglial process, but did not report rapid migration of microglial cell bodies away from the injured area. These data indicate that microglia do not present tissue antigens to lymph node at the same rate (if at all) as other tissue macrophages or immature dendritic cells.",

Consistent with their failure to emigrate from the CNS to lymph nodes, these types of studies have confirmed that CNS microglia are relatively ineffective at initiating antigen-driven CD4+T-cell responses (Carson et al., 2006, Schwartz and Kipnis, 2011, Dilger and Johnson, 2008, Byram et al., 2004). Instead, this function is provided primarily by infiltrating dendritic cells and to a lesser extent by perivascular macrophages. By themselves, these data do not indicate that microglial antigen presentation is irrelevant. Additional studies suggest that antigen presentation may have purposes complementary to professional APCs (Carson et al., 2006, Schwartz and Kipnis, 2011, Byram et al., 2004). For example, CD4+T-cells can develop neuroprotective functions able to slow the rate of axotomy-induced cell death of facial motoneurons located in the brain stem (Byram et al., 2004). Using irradiation chimeric models and adoptive transfer of axotomy-activated CD4+T-cells, microglia were again demonstrated to be unable to initiate axotomy-induced CD4+T-cell responses. However, MHC class II\u2013expressing microglia were demonstrated to be absolutely essential to evoke or sustain the neuroprotective functions of CD4+T-cells initially activated by the peripheral immune system. In addition, several studies have reported that depending on the T-cell activation state, microglial-T-cell interactions can promote microglia to acquire either growth factor\u2013producing, neurogenic, neuro-repairing phenotypes or cytotoxic, neurodestructive phenotypes.",

Experimental expression of Tmem176b inhibits acquisition of classical APC functions as well as increasing the rate of apoptosis of activated microglia and macrophages. These and similar data demonstrate the robust and active regulatory role of the CNS microenvironment and raise an unresolved and highly debated issue in neuroimmunology.

Thus neuronal regulation of both microglia and macrophages activation can be coordinately regulated via this pathway. By contrast, CX3CR1, the fractalkine receptor, is expressed at higher levels on microglia, while CD45, the receptor for CD22, is expressed at higher levels on CNS-infiltrating macrophages (Lo et al., 1999, Carson et al., 2006, Biber et al., 2007). Thus, neurons can simultaneously regulate microglia and macrophage functions using cell type\u2013specific mechanisms. Lastly, as discussed for macrophages in above, microglial functions are also regulated by neurotransmitter exposure. For example, glutamate amplifies classical activation responses while norepinephrine reduces these responses. These types of data demonstrate the potential for the types and degree of neuronal activity to regulate immune responses of CNS-resident microglia and CNS-infiltrating immune cells (Carson et al., 2006, Carson and Lo, 2007, Biber et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The previous sections have described multiple neuroimmune interactions. When these interactions are dysregulated or inappropriately prolonged, they can be maladaptive for CNS function. Notably, proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species produced by activated innate and adaptive immune cells have demonstrated potential to damage neurons and glia (Dilger and Johnson, 2008, Biber et al., 2007). Thus, cytotoxic immune functions are well recognized to contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. More recently, profiling studies have begun to demonstrate aberrant expression of immune-associated molecules in tissue taken from humans with classical neurologic disorders such as schizophrenia and autism (Dilger and Johnson, 2008, Biber et al., 2007) (see in Ch. 59). The extent to which CNS immune responses are contributing to\u2014or are merely responding to\u2014CNS dysfunction is unknown. Nor do we know all of the mechanisms by which immune cells can regulate CNS function. However, in animal models, T-cell contact with neuronal axons and T-cell\u2013produced granzyme (apoptosis inducing serine protease) have been implicated in the initiation and progression of some forms of seizure activity. Prolonged purigenic and/or cytokine activation of microglia and macrophages can alter pain thresholds. Conversely, inappropriate initiation or prolongation of immune-mediated neurorepair functions can promote tumor growth or prevent elimination of neurons and glia that should be eliminated by programmed death mechanisms.",

            "text": "Neuroimmune interactions can also induce patterns of behavior, referred to as sickness behavior, that are unpleasant for an individual but that have adaptive survival consequences (Dilger & Johnson, 2008). During inflammatory responses to pathogens, systemic production of TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 acts on the CNS vasculature to promote glial production of proinflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins within the CNS. These cytokines also act on the vagal nerve and may be actively transported across the BBB into the CNS. This in turn initiates a program of behaviors that serve to enhance immune attack on the pathogen and survival of the individual. Specifically, systemic inflammation promotes\u25aafever, generating a non-optimal environment for pathogen survival\n\u25aaanorexia, which limits systemic availability of nutrients and cofactors\u25aalethargy and slow-wave sleep, which serve to conserve the individual\u2019s metabolic resources\u25aadecreased social, reproductive and exploratory behaviors\nCarsonMonica J.One Pathogen but Three Immune Responses with Three Neurologic OutcomesMeasles is a highly contagious illness caused by paramyxovirus family virus. Almost all non-immune children contract this respiratory disease if exposed to the virus. While immunization effectively controls the incidence of measles, decreasing rates of immunization in developed regions and lack of access to immunization are allowing the immunologic side effects of measles to emerge as a significant health risk. Here we present three rare complications of measles infection to demonstrate the consequences of too much, too little or just the wrong type of neuroimmune responses.\n1.\n An immune response sufficiently effective to clear a pathogen can also cause lethal brain damage after the pathogen has been effectively cleared. For example, acute post-infectious measles encephalomyelitis (APME) is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, seizures and multifocal neurological signs one to two weeks after appearance of the measles rash and is fatal in 10\u201320% of patients. Despite the absence of detectable measles virus in the CNS of these patients, clinical features of APME correlate with robust influx of blood-derived macrophages and lymphocytes into the CNS. The sum of the published data suggest that during immune-mediated clearance of measles from the body, pathogen-provided alarm signals (PAMPs) led to the inappropriate activation of T-cells able to recognize self-antigens in 0.1% of patients infected with measles.\n2.\n Ineffective immune responses are ineffective in removing PAMP signals and thus promote chronic neurotoxic inflammation. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare complication of measles infection and is associated with continual low-grade inflammation of the CNS. Clinical symptoms emerge 5\u201310 years after systemic clearance of the measles virus and include mental deterioration, appearance of myoclonus, optic atrophy and akinetic mutism. Based on experimental models, SSPE is presumed to result from CNS infection by partially defective measles virus particles incapable of budding from the surface of infected cells. The budding-defective viral clones are able to persist and spread throughout the CNS because of ineffective antigen presentation and detection of viral particles. Clinical pathology is likely the combined result of persistent production of TNF and IL-1\u03b2, accumulation of intrathecal oligoclonal IgG, as well as the persistence of measles virus within cells of the CNS.\n3.\n Too little immunity can result in normally benign viruses, bacteria and parasites lethally disrupting brain function. In this situation, brain damage and/or death can be due to competition for metabolic components, to disruption of CNS intracellular signaling by pathogen products or to direct pathogen killing of CNS cells. Measles-infected children with viral or drug-induced immunodeficiencies cannot always control the viral infection, resulting in a general progressive neurological deterioration that includes seizures. Neuronal damage, astrogliosis and inclusion bodies in both neurons and glia are observed in brain pathology samples from infected individuals. The only effective treatment in this situation is to attempt to halt viral replication with antiviral drug therapies.\n",

Therefore, age, environmental factors and neuronal activity may alter neuroimmune interactions with detrimental consequences for neuronal function. Thus, it is tempting to suggest that inhibiting neuroimmune responses is the correct therapeutic choice for neurodegenerative disease. However, the better choice might be to manipulate neuroimmune interactions to redirect immune-cell functions. For example, autoreactive T-cells can provide neuroprotection both directly and indirectly by stimulating CNS production of growth and survival factors (Schwartz and Kipnis, 2011, Dilger and Johnson, 2008). Similarly, increasing influx of macrophages into the CNS and decreasing neuronal inhibition of microglial phagocytic activity are both effective measures to decrease amyloid burden in murine models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
