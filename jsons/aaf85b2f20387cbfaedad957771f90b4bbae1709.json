During virus outbreaks, anxiety is widespread. However, the role of trait health anxiety, cyberchondria, and coping in the context of virus anxiety during the current COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been studied. An online survey was conducted in the German general population (N=1,615, 79.8% female, Mage=33.36 years, SD=13.18) in mid-March 2020, which included questionnaires on anxiety associated with SARS-CoV-2, trait health anxiety, cyberchondriaPandemic (i.e. excessive online information search), and emotion regulation. The participants reported a significantly increasing virus anxiety in recent months (previous months recorded retrospectively), especially among individuals with heightened trait health anxiety. CyberchondriaPandemic showed positive correlations with current virus anxiety (r=.09 -.48), and this relationship was additionally moderated by trait health anxiety. A negative correlation was found between the perception of being informed about the pandemic and the current virus anxiety (r=-.18), with adaptive emotion regulation being a significant moderator for this relationship. The findings suggest that trait health anxiety and cyberchondria serve as risk factors, whereas information about the pandemic and adaptive emotion regulation might represent buffering factors for anxiety during a virus pandemic.",

Previous studies of past epidemics and pandemics (e.g., Ebola 2014 , H1N1 2009 /2010 , avian influenza 2006 , SARS 2003 have shown that anxiety, health worries, and safety behavior are widespread in these times (Jalloh et al., 2018; Lau, Griffiths, Choi, & Tsui, 2010; Main, Zhou, Ma, Luecken, & Liu, 2011; Saadatian-Elahi, Facy, Del Signore, & Vanhems, 2010) . Studies have found that up to over 50% of respondents report worries or anxiety during virus-induced epidemics or pandemics (Bults et al., 2011; Goulia, Mantas, Dimitroula, Mantis, & Hyphantis, 2010; Jalloh et al., 2018; Lau et al., 2010) . Recently, some studies have begun to investigate anxiety and other emotional symptoms during the current COVID-19 pandemic (Cao et al., 2020; Huang & Zhao, 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Xiao, Zhang, Kong, Li, & Yang, 2020b , 2020a Zhang & Ma, 2020) . Following models for the development of health anxiety (Brown, Skelly, & Chew-Graham, 2019; Williams, 2004; Witth\u00f6ft & Hiller, 2010) , however, there is currently still a lack of research on specific factors of vulnerability (e.g., trait health anxiety), amplification (e.g., cyberchondria), and coping (e.g., emotional regulation) regarding health anxiety in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic Rajkumar, 2020; Zhang & Ma, 2020) .",

Health anxiety-i.e., worries and anxiety due to a perceived threat to health-is conceptualized as a dimensional construct that can range on a continuum from absent health awareness to pathological health anxiety or hypochondriasis (Abramowitz & Braddock, 2008; Bailer et al., 2016; Ferguson, 2009 ). Cognitive-behavioral models of health anxiety and hypochondriasis (Warwick, 1989; Witth\u00f6ft & Hiller, 2010 ) assume that bodily sensations or benign symptoms are interpreted as threatening and as signs of a serious illness which can lead to health anxiety and subsequently to an increase in bodily sensations.",

The vicious circle of bodily sensations, cognitions, and anxiety may be more likely to occur in the case of certain predisposing factors (e.g., general vulnerability to anxiety) and may be maintained by illness behavior (e.g., safety-seeking behavior such as Internet research or visits to the doctor) in the sense of negative reinforcement (Williams, 2004; Witth\u00f6ft & Hiller, 2010) . Regarding interpretation and attribution processes, it is probably more likely in times of a virus outbreak that body sensations or symptoms are interpreted according to this context (e.g., \"I'm breathing faster, I may have been infected by the coronavirus\"; Blakey & Abramowitz, 2017) . Studies of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f earlier pandemics (e.g., SARS) found that overestimation of the threat is associated with increased anxiety (Blakey & Abramowitz, 2017; Xie, Stone, Zheng, & Zhang, 2011) .",

During virus outbreaks, media reports are increasingly consumed, which often use an emotional language and address emotional content that catches people's attention (Bao, Sun, Meng, Shi, & Lu, 2020; Garfin et al., 2020; Hansen, 2009; Klemm, Das, & Hartmann, 2016; Tausczik, Faasse, Pennebaker, & Petrie, 2012) . Hansen (2009) , for example, conducted a detailed narrative analysis of media reports in Norway during the SARS pandemic of 2003 and concluded that the media stir up anxiety among the population, e.g., by reporting selectively negative individual cases or inappropriate comparisons (e.g., Black Death in 14th century in Europe) and by using emotional and dramatic language. Studies during previous pandemics and the current COVID-19 pandemic found that media consumption is positively associated with anxiety (Gao et al., 2020; Moghanibashi-Mansourieh, 2020; Purohit et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2020) . However, the results are inconsistent with regard to the exact relationship between knowledge about the virus and health anxiety (Blakey & Abramowitz, 2017; Goulia et al., 2010; Lei et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . While Blakey and Abramowitz (2017) and Lei et al. (2020) found that a higher level of knowledge about the virus is associated with increased anxiety, Goulia et al. (2010) found that perceived knowledge is associated with less worry. In the study by Wang et al. (2020) , there was no significant correlation between knowledge about the virus J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and anxiety, but the desire for additional information was associated with less anxiety.",

Regarding emotion regulation, we assumed that dysfunctional emotion regulation has a positive relationship and adaptive emotion regulation a negative relationship with the current virus anxiety. In terms of favorable coping with the pandemic, we expected that the combination of favorable factors (feeling well informed and adaptive emotion regulation) should be associated with low virus anxiety (i.e., adaptive emotion regulation as a moderator in the relationship between being informed and current virus anxiety).",

In previous studies, the subscale \"mistrust\" tended to be a separate construct, so that this subscale was excluded in the present study as well as in previous studies (Fergus, 2014; McElroy et al., 2019; Norr, Allan, Boffa, Raines, & Schmidt, 2015) . This version with four subscales is also equivalent to the English short version with 12 items (CSS-12; McElroy et al., 2019) . For the current study, the items have been slightly modified so that the Internet research refers to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., \"I panic when I read online that a symptom I have might be related to the coronavirus pandemic\"). The statements are answered using a five-point Likert scale from 1 = never to 5 = always. The CSS proved to be reliable and showed a positive correlation with the mSHAI (r = .57, p < .001, Barke et al., 2016) . Barke et al.

Participants characteristics and anxiety related to SARS-CoV-2 Table 1 shows the participant characteristics with regard to questions specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and the self-report measures SHAI, CSSPandemic, and CERQ-short. First, the characteristics of trait health anxiety (SHAI) and cyberchondria (CSSPandemic) were examined to describe the sample. Compared with a meta-analysis on the SHAI (Alberts et al., 2013) , the average score of the total SHAI in this study (M = 14.68, SD = 6.58) was slightly higher with a and least informed about medical capacities (M = 48.39, SD = 27.95, 0-100). Regarding behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, three topics were affirmed by more than 90% of participants (increasing hand washing, avoiding crowds > 100 people, avoiding major events > 1,000 people). Table 2 shows the relationships between the current virus anxiety, health anxiety, cyberchondriaPandemic, the perception of being informed, and emotion regulation. Current virus J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f anxiety showed positive relationships with trait health anxiety (r = .34, p < .001), cyberchondriaPandemic (especially distress caused by Internet research, r = .48, p < .001), and maladaptive emotion regulation (r = .17, p < .001), and a negative relationship with the perception of being well informed (r = -.18, p < .001). Trait health anxiety correlated positively with cyberchondria (especially distress, r = .40, p < .001) and maladaptive emotion regulation (r = .33, p < .001), and negatively with the perception of being well informed (r = -.17, p < .001) and adaptive emotion regulation (r = -.13, p < .001). The better-informed the participants felt, the less cyberchondria was reported (r = -.24, p < .001). In addition, we tested the hypothesis whether the relationship between cyberchondria and the current virus anxiety (March 2020) is moderated by trait health anxiety. Trait health anxiety was shown to be a significant moderator in the relationship between cyberchondria related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the current virus anxiety (B = -.032, p = .004; explanation of variance of the whole model R 2 = 20.85%, p < .001).

It is possible that participants in the COVID-19 pandemic may have reported higher scores in the SHAI, as the self-report also covers the last 6 months. Alternatively, previous studies in non-clinical samples have been conducted almost exclusively on student samples that differ from the sample examined here in terms of sociodemographic variables (e.g., younger average age, higher average educational level), which could possibly also explain (smaller) differences in the SHAI scores. In comparison to an earlier study on cybechondria in the German general population (Barke et al., 2016) , we found higher average scores in the subscale \"compulsion\" and lower average scores in the subscales J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f \"excessiveness\" and \"reassurance\". Because we have adapted the CSS for the pandemic (e.g., search for symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), the results are only comparable to a limited extent. It is possible that due to the current media presence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Gao et al., 2020) , during the pandemic people may be more often distracted from their activities and occupations by this topic, which could explain the increased scores in the subscale \"compulsion\". With regard to the subscales \"excessiveness\" and \"reassurance\", the lower levels found here could be explained by the fact that possible symptoms of an infection are searched online less often compared to other topics of the pandemic, and that during the COVID-19 pandemic doctors are visited less often (Mehrotra, Chernew, Linetsky, Hatch, & Cutler, 2020 ).",

However, direct comparability is difficult because of differences in the samples studied (e.g., general population, students, health-care workers), as well as in the measuring instruments and questions for assessing anxiety, which range from standardized self-report measures with no concrete reference to the epidemic/pandemic to concrete questions of concern about infecting oneself or a family member (Cao et al., 2020; Goulia et al., 2010; Jalloh et al., 2018; Lai et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2020) .

(2020) found in a survey of the Chinese general population, conducted at a similar time of the virus spread in the country (survey from 31 January to 2 February 2020, about 15,000 confirmed cases), that about 30% reported anxiety symptoms in a standardized self-report measure without any concrete reference to the pandemic and 75% were concerned that family members might get infected with SARS-CoV-2.

As in the study by Moghanibashi-Mansourieh (2020), middle-aged people (in this study: 30-59 years) reported a stronger anxiety associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, possibly because this age group is facing greater family and job concerns (e.g., financial worries). At first glance differing from previous studies (Lai et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020a) , this study found that people who work in the health care sector report less virus anxiety. However, to date, hardly any studies have directly compared health care workers with employees in other sectors, and in contrast to other studies, this study has broadly defined the health care sector (e.g., including psychology, nutrition, physiotherapy) and specifically asked about the fear of the virus rather than more general anxiety symptoms. The result of this study could be explained by the fact that healthcare workers are more accurately informed about the virus and the pandemic and are confronted with this issue in their daily work, which could possibly lead to a habituation-like effect.",

Even though we have examined state anxiety (\"today\"), and cyberchondria refers to a longer period of time, we cannot draw any causal conclusions with our study design. The relationship with the subscale \"seeking reassurance\" was very weak (r = .09/.12, p < .001) in contrast to the other subscales of cyberchondriaPandemic (r = .19-48, p < .001). The items of this subscale refer to the fact that the Internet search leads to a doctor's visit or that the results of the Internet search are discussed with the doctor, which is likely to be less relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., a tendency to avoid visits to the doctor by recommending to visit a doctor only in urgent cases or with clear symptoms, or fears of being infected related to the visit to the doctor). The perception of being informed about the pandemic was consistently negatively correlated (albeit rather weakly correlated) with current virus anxiety, health anxiety, and cyberchondria. Feeling well informed thus seems to have a buffering and beneficial effect on the emotional state; on the other hand, people who feel wellinformed seem to conduct less excessive and burdensome Internet research. This finding is also in line with current models of cyberchondria (Brown et al., 2019; Starcevic & Berle, 2013) .",

In terms of risk factors, it should be easier to reduce them with regard to cyberchondria, such as by educating and recommending behavior for the population (e.g., that excessive use of the Internet can increase anxiety; recommending reputable sources; basic help to reduce cyberchondria) and that recommendations should also be followed in media reporting (e.g., concrete/accurate, reputable information, avoiding fear-inducing language).

            "text": "Some limitations should be mentioned. Although the study covers a large sample, it is not representative of the German general population in terms of socio-demographic variables (79.8% female, Mage = 33.36 years, 39.4% students). In addition, the type of recruitment (including social media) as well as the online nature of the study probably appealed more to people with an Internet affinity. It is possible that persons with a higher affinity for the Internet and online activities also show higher overall values in cyberchondria. Compared to the study by Barke et al. (2016) , however, the sample of this study showed lower values in two subscales (and a higher and a comparable value in another subscale each). Concerning the information on the pandemic, the subjective evaluation of being informed was assessed, as it was assumed that the subjective experience is more associated with anxiety than with objectively assessed knowledge (e.g., through a quiz). However, it would have been interesting to examine whether the subjective evaluation is related to the objectively assessed knowledge and how the latter is related to anxiety. The virus anxiety in December 2019 and end of January 2020 was retrospectively recorded. This data could be influenced by memory bias, by interpretations depending on the current context (e.g., \"Currently the pandemic is much stronger, I was hardly worried at all at an earlier time\"), or by assumptions about a possible course. Overall, it would be promising for future studies to conduct longitudinal studies (e.g., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ecological momentary assessments) to assess anxiety during virus outbreaks in order to be able to draw causal conclusions. Since the implementation of this study, three standardized self-report measures have been published that were specifically designed to assess anxiety and distress during the coronavirus pandemic, the \"COVID Stress Scales\" (CSS; Taylor et al., 2020; e.g., \"I am worried about catching the virus.\"), the \"Fear of COVID Scale\" (FC-19S; Ahorsu et al., 2020 ; e.g., \"I am most afraid of coronavirus-19.\"), and the \"Coronavirus Anxiety Scale\" (CAS; Lee, 2020; e.g., \"I had trouble falling or staying asleep because I was thinking about the coronavirus.\"). Due to the heterogeneity of measurement methods and individual, non-validated, questions in previous studies, it would be essential for the comparability and validity of studies on anxiety and distress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that these instruments continue to be tested and are increasingly used in future COVID-19 studies.",

Regarding potential buffering effects on anxiety, the study found negative correlations between the perception of being informed and the virus anxiety. Current virus anxiety was particularly low when individuals feel well informed and when they use adaptive emotion regulation strategies (acceptance and putting into perspective). These findings may indicate starting points for interventions in times of a virus outbreak, such as the reduction of cyberchondria, providing and disseminating accurate information about the pandemic and effective communication through the media, as well as the promotion of adaptive emotion regulation strategies.",

In addition, the participants were asked to indicate their subjective perception of being informed on various aspects related to the virus outbreak (transmission routes, symptoms, dangerousness, prevention, survival time of the virus on surfaces, availability of drugs, capacities of medical care, 0-100), as well as their current behaviors related to the pandemic (multiple choice format; Internet research, visits",

Compared to an earlier study in the German general population (Barke et al., 2016; see average scores in the method), in this study women and men reported higher scores in the subscale \"compulsion\" (Mwomen = 1.85, SD = 0.96; Mmen = 1.82, SD = 0.91) with low to medium effect sizes (d = 0.38 -0.67) and lower scores in the subscales \"excessiveness\" (Mwomen = 2.15, SD = 0.91; Mmen = 1.95, SD = 0.82) and \"reassurance\" (Mwomen = 1.62, SD = 0.76; Mmen = 1.66, SD = 0.83) with low to medium effect sizes (d = 0.40 -0.74). Anxiety in relation to the virus showed a significant increase over the three measurement dates (F(1.47,2374.32) = 2386.04, p < .001, \u03b7p 2 = .60), both from December 2019 to January 2020 (t(1614) = |27.85|, p < .001, d = 0.59) and especially strong from January 2020 to March 2020 (t(1614) = |46.14|, p < .001, d = 1.16; the anxiety in December 2019 and January 2020 was assessed retrospectively). About half of the respondents stated that they suffer from moderate level of anxiety about the virus (March 2020) showed no significant correlations with age or education (r \u2264 .03, p \u2265 .32). However, when considering age categories (16-29, 30-59, and over 60 years of age) we found a significant effect of the age category (F(2, 1612) = 5.82, p = .003, \u03b7p 2 = .01) with 30-59 year-olds differing significantly from the younger and older age groups (t(172.67) \u2265 2.10, p \u2264 .037, d \u2265 0.22), the latter showing no significant difference (t(152.28) = 0.67, p = .51, d = 0.07). Women (M = 49.47, SD = 27.00) reported a significantly higher virus anxiety than men (M = 43.04, SD = 27.08; t(1606) = 3.81, p < .001, d = 0.24). College students and participants employed in a health profession (e.g., psychology, medicine, physiotherapy, nursing; M = 45.40, SD = 24.99) reported a significantly lower virus anxiety compared to the other participants (M = 49.59, SD = 28.06; t(1246.09) = 2.95, p = .003, d = 0.16). With the exception of a very small significant correlation between the current virus anxiety and a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the wider social environment (r = .07, p =.007), no significant correlations between the current virus anxiety and a SARS-Cov-2 infection or the quarantine situation (self, others) were observed (r \u2264 .05, p \u2265 .06). Ratings of being well informed about the virus/pandemic varied according to the topic surveyed. Participants reported being best informed about the transmission routes of the virus (M = 72.66, SD = 24.06, 0-100) and possibilities of prevention (M = 70.61, SD = 25.70, 0-100)",
