While there is agreement on the preference for lower tidal volumes [1, 2], there is relatively little consensus on the selection of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [3\u20139]. Traditionally, lower PEEP has been used [10, 11], but low PEEP can lead to increases in oxygen desaturation and hypoxaemia [4, 12] and worsening of lung injury, indicated by greater use of rescue therapies and deaths after rescue therapy [9]. High PEEP can increase alveolar recruitment, but can decrease cardiac output and lead to further lung injury due to barotrauma and/or volutrauma [13] or overdistension [4, 9].",

In patients with ARDS, PEEP reduces ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [4, 9], increases recruitment [14\u201316], and reduces inflammatory mediators in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [8]. MV strategies combining low tidal volumes with recruitment manoeuvres (RMs) and higher PEEP to prevent VILI have been hypothesized as ideal for lung protection [6, 17]. However, currently, there is still no standardized approach to the selection of this optimal PEEP, or to deciding how often PEEP should be adjusted or recalculated.",

[18\u201320] indicate that pigs induced with ARDS experience minimal respiratory elastance at a specific PEEP associated with higher oxygenation, maximum recruitment, and higher functional residual capacity, all without signs of lung overdistension. Equally, it has been proposed that PEEP should be set whereby the lung has minimal respiratory elastance (or maximum compliance), which could be clinically beneficial by balancing the risks of PEEP that is set too low or too high [21\u201323]. Aside from the work by Suter et al. [21], Pintado et al. also showed that PEEP selection at minimal elastance is beneficial to patients [22]. Despite some consistent findings, the application of minimal elastance PEEP selection remains limited and hindered by the lack of an objective, reliable, and easy-to-use method to determine elastance at the bedside in real time.",

Following the study, a phase-2 randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed to assess mechanical ventilation at minimal elastance PEEP in patients with ARDS versus standard practice of care in a single-centre hospital. In particular, patient-specific respiratory system elastance and corresponding minimal elastance PEEP is determined using a validated model-based method and computer software [25]. This trial uses real-time-identified patient-specific respiratory system elastance, and thus the trial is named the Clinical utilisation of respiratory elastance (CURE) RCT. This manuscript presents the detailed clinical protocol for the phase-2 CURE RCT. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN12613001006730.",

In contrast, coughing, breath-holding, and other dyssynchronous efforts may cause an apparent increase in elastance [34]. Figure 2 shows an example of ventilator dyssynchrony in a pressure-controlled mode. Dyssynchrony may be seen as negative deflections (\u201cM\u201d waves) in the flow-time waveform, as shown in Fig. 2. In contrast the airway pressure may only be changed minimally by patient effort.\n",

The computer software, CURE Soft [25], uses a single compartment lung model [39] together with other model-based approach [24, 40] to aid clinicians during PEEP selection. This process potentially reduces selected PEEP variability and provides more consistent clinical guidance.",

The double-staircase RM in this trial was designed to assess lung recruitment and provide consistent PEEP titration. It is noted that not all patients included in this study will necessarily demonstrate alveolar lung recruitment.",

Thus, the standard practice ventilation in the participating hospital relies on general approaches [2] and is highly variable between clinicians. There may be no equal comparator for a mechanical ventilation study resulting from this variability. Patients recruited to the CURE RCT will have the MV mode set to bi-level ventilation in both the intervention and the control group; it is debatable that bi-level ventilation may lack certain ventilation advantages. However, this procedure will reduce variability and provides the opportunity for fair comparison between groups.",

ARDS is nearly always regarded as a complication of an acute process. One concern is that the desired sample size cannot be achieved. However, this number is also too small compared to reports [43, 44]. The small number may be due to changes in the ARDS definition [27, 45] and misdiagnosis [46]. Estenssoro et al. [46] report that misdiagnosis could occur due to delayed screening. Thus, in the CURE RCT, any patient requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is screened immediately, as per Villar et al. [27], whereby the P/F ratio is measured at PEEP = 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 = 50%. Equally, retrospective screening was also performed and identified > 200 patients eligible for the trial per year. Hence, a 3-year study is planned to achieve the target sample size at an estimated recruitment rate of 50%.",

It provides a means to select patient-specific PEEP in a consistent fashion and patient outcomes are compared to current practice. The CURE RCT investigation group hope that the results from this trial will support the use of model-based methods to estimate optimal PEEP, and will serve as a platform to assess other patient-centred outcomes in future mechanical ventilation studies in ARDS/ALI.",
