Mac1 likely counters host-mediated 27 antiviral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to 28 viral infections. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with 29 ADP-ribose refined at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 30 exhibit similar structural folds and ADP-ribose binding modes as shown by structural 31 comparison. All three CoV Mac1 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low \u03bc M affinities. They 32 also demonstrated highly efficient de-MARylating activity, which was greater than that of the 33 human Mdo2 macrodomain. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins 34 are highly efficient ADP-ribosylhydrolases with strikingly similar activity, indicating that 35 compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad antiviral activity against CoVs. 36 37 IMPORTANCE 38 SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide 39 pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused nearly 300K deaths worldwide. With, no currently 40 approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses 41 encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose, a 42 post-translation modification, from proteins. This protein domain is essential for CoV 43 pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and 44 enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of 45 SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and 46 hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins, and a 47 human macrodomain. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of 48 potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain. 49",

More recently it has been demonstrated that CoV Mac1 can hydrolyze the bond 84 between amino acid chains and ADP-ribose molecules 14-16 , indicating that it can reverse protein 85 ADP-ribosylation 6,8 . ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification catalyzed by ADP-86 ribosyltransferases (also known as PARPs) through transferring an ADP-ribose moiety from 87 NAD + onto target proteins 17 . The ADP-ribose is transferred as single mono-ADP-ribose unit 88 (MAR), or single units of ADP-ribose are transferred consecutively to form a poly-ADP-ribose 89 chain (PAR). CoV Mac1 efficiently hydrolyzes MAR, but has minimal activity against PAR 14,15 . 90 Several MARylating PARPs are induced by interferon (IFN) and are known to inhibit virus 91 replication, implicating ADP-ribosylation in the host-response to infection 18 . 92",

This mutation has minimal 95 effects on virus replication in transformed cells, but reduces viral load, leads to enhanced IFN 96 production, and strongly attenuates both Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV in 97 mouse models of infection 7, 16, 19, 20 .

K44 and G46 also make hydrogen bonds with the 2' OH of the 157 distal ribose, G48 makes contact with the 1' OH and a water that resides near the catalytic site, 158 while the backbone nitrogen atom of V49 hydrogen bonds with the \u03b1 -phosphate.

We next 167 sought to compare the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 to other deposited structures of this protein. 168 Superposition with Apo (6WEN) and ADP-ribose complexed protein (6W02) yielded RMSD of 169 0.48 \u00c5 (168 residues) and 0.37 \u00c5 (165 residues), respectively, indicating a high degree of 170 similarity (Fig. S3A-B). Comparison of the ADP-ribose binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 with 171 that of the apo structure (6WEN) revealed minor conformational differences in order to 172 accommodate ADP-ribose binding. The loop between \u03b2 3 and \u03b1 2 (H45-V49) undergoes a change 173 in conformation and the sidechain of F132 is moved out of the ADP-ribose binding site (Fig. 174 S3C). Our ADP-ribose bound structure is nearly identical to 6W02, except for slight deviations 175 in the \u03b2 3-\u03b12 loop and an altered conformation of F156, where the aryl ring of F156 is moved 176 closer to the adenine ring (Fig. S3 C-D). However, this is likely a result of crystal packing as 177 F156 adopts this conformation in each subunit and would likely clash with subunit residues 178 related by either crystallographic or non-crystallographic symmetry. 179 We next compared the ADP-ribose bound SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 structure with that of 180 SARS-CoV (PDB 2FAV) and MERS-CoV (PDB 5HOL) Mac1 proteins. Superposition yielded 181 RMSD deviations of 0.71 \u00c5 (166 residues) and 1.06 \u00c5 (161 residues) for 2FAV and 5HOL, 182 respectively. Additionally, the ADP-ribose binding mode in the SARS-CoV and SARSbinds to adenine, are localized in a similar region although there are 185 slight differences in the rotamers about the C\u03b2-C\u03b3 bond. The angles between the mean planes 186 defined by the OD1, CG and OD2 atoms relative to SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 is 23.1 o and 46.5 o for 187 the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 structures, respectively. Another notable difference is 188 that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 macrodomains have an isoleucine (I23) following this 189 aspartic acid while MERS-CoV has an alanine (A22). Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-190 CoV Mac1 have a valine instead of an isoleucine immediately following the GGG motif 191 (V49/I48). From these structures it appears that having two isoleucines in this location would 192 clash, and that lineage B and lineage C \u03b2 -CoVs has evolved in unique ways to create space in 193 this pocket (Fig. 4D and data not shown). Despite these small differences in local structure, the 194 overall structure of CoV Mac1 domains remain remarkably conserved, and indicates they likely 195 have similar biochemical activities and biological functions. 196 SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV bind to ADP-ribose with similar 197 affinities. To determine if the CoV macrodomains had any noticeable differences in their ability 198 to bind ADP-ribose, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which measures the 199 energy released or absorbed during a binding reaction.

From these reports it is clear that CoV Mac1 is vital for the ability of 274 these viruses to cause disease, and have indicated that it could be a novel therapeutic target. 275 Despite this, there are no known compounds that inhibit this domain. The outbreak of COVID-19 276 has illustrated an incredible need for developing multiple therapeutic drugs targeting conserved 277 coronavirus proteins. Mac1 appears to be an ideal candidate for further drug development based 278 on its: i) highly conserved structure and biochemical activities within CoVs; and ii) its clear 279 importance for multiple CoVs to cause disease. Targeting Mac1 may also have the benefit of 280 enhancing the innate immune response, as we have shown that Mac1 is required for some CoVs 281 to block IFN production 16,21 . Considering that Mac1 from divergent \u03b1 CoVs such as 229E and 282 FIPV also have de-ADP-ribosylating activity 14,15 , it is also possible that compounds targeting 283 Mac1 could prevent disease caused by of wide variety of CoV, including those of veterinary 284 importance like porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Further, compounds that inhibit Mac1 285 could help identify its protein targets during infection. Future studies could utilize the SARS-286",
